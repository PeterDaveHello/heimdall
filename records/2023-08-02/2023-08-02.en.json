NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PIPELINECHEMICAL NEWS A Room-Temperature Superconductor? New Developments 1 AUG 2023 BY DEREK LOWE6 MIN READ COMMENTS SHARE: Twitter Linked In Facebook Reddit Wechat EmailIntro:I'm doing this as a follow-on to my previous post on this topic, since this is a fast-changing story. To recap, preprints appeared last week making the remarkable claim of a well-above-room-temperature superconducting material at ambient pressure, dubbed LK-99. This is one of the most sought-after goals in all of materials science and condensed matter physics, something that until now has only been found in (numerous!) science fiction stories. The potential applications of such a material almost can go without saying - depending on what current density it could accommodate, it could improve almost anything that uses electromagnetism.Well, extraordinary claims need extraordinary proof, and where things like this usually fall apart is difficulty with replication. The experimental preparation of LK-99 was not very complicated at all, though, and did not use any particularly exotic materials or equipment, so the expectation was that many labs would immediately try to reproduce it. There are always complications, of course: even the original authors said that their samples were polycrystalline and heterogeneous, and there is no expectation that the reported preparation is an optimized one. (Whether the authors have a better one that is yet unpublished is an open question!) This means that replication might not be a smooth process, but it also means that a lot of people will be giving it a try, increasing the chances for success even if there are variables that we don't yet appreciate. Even the ones we do appreciate (starting material purity, presence of oxygen, particle size, heating and cooling rate, size/shape of the vessel) are enough to give you a lot of variability, I'd say.Another complication has been some apparent infighting among the authors of the preprints. The two manuscripts appeared in close proximity, one with three authors and one with six. As I understand it (subject to change!) reports are that the three-author preprint might be withdrawn, supposedly because one of the authors submitted it without consulting with some of the others, and that the six-author one is now being readied for submission to a peer-reviewed journal (the preprint itself has already been revised). It may be a while before we understand what has actually been going on behind the scenes, but honestly, I can't blame anyone for some excitability and confusion. If I'd been in on the discovery of a room-temperature superconductor I would have surely have gone into Headless Poultry Mode myself.The Latest, As of August 1As of this morning, there are (as yet not really verified) reports of replication from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. At least, a video has been posted showed what could be a sample of LK-99 levitating over a magnet due to the Meissner effect, and in different orientations relative to the magnet itself. That's important, because a (merely!) paramagnetic material can levitate in a sufficiently strong field (as can diamagnetic materials like water droplets and frogs), but these can come back to a particular orientation like a compass needle. Superconductors are \"perfect diamagnets\", excluding all magnetic fields, and that's a big difference. The \"Meissner effect\" that everyone has been hearing about so much is observed when a material first becomes superconductive at the right temperature and expels whatever magnetic fields were penetrating it at the time. All this said, we're having to take the video on the statements of whoever made/released it, and there are other possible explanations for the it that do not involve room-temperature superconductivity. I will be very happy if this is a real replication, but I'm not taking the day off yet to celebrate just based on this.And even though I'm usually more of an experimental-results guy than a theory guy, two other new preprints interest me greatly. One is from a team at the Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, and the other is from Sinéad Griffin at Lawrence Berkeley. Both start from the reported X-ray structural data of LK-99 and look at its predicted behavior via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. And they come to very similar conclusions: it could work. This is quite important, because this could mean that we don't need to postulate completely new physics to explain something like LK-99 - if you'd given the starting data to someone as a blind test, they would have come back after the DFT runs saying \"You know, this looks like it could be a really good superconductor. . .\" Here's Griffin:I present the calculated spin-polarized electronic structure in Fig. 3. Remarkably, I find an isolated set of flat bands crossing the Fermi level, with a maximum bandwidth of ∼130 meV (see Fig.4) that is separated from the rest of the valence manifold by 160 meV. Such a narrow bandwidth is particularly indicative of strongly correlated bands. . .unlike other correlated-d band superconductors, in this system the Cu-d bands are particularly flat – there is minimal band broadening from neighboring oxygen ions. If previous assumptions about band flatness driving superconductivity are correct, then this result would suggest a much more robust (higher temperature) superconducting phase exists in this system, even compared to well-established high-TC systems.If you're not a solid-state band theory person (no disgrace!), the Fermi level is the theoretical energy for an electron in a solid material where it would have a 50% chance of occupying that energy level at any given time - sort of the \"natural home\" for mobile conducting electrons in a given material. Electrons in solids are modeled as occupying a series of \"bands\" of different energies, separated by band gaps. If a material is an insulator, that means that its Fermi level is sitting inside a wide band gap, and its electrons will not be able to give you any current. Metals, on the other hand, have one or more bands that land at the Fermi level (in semiconductors, in case you're wondering, the Fermi level sort of \"grazes\" the bands, close enough to where thermal energy can move some electrons into them).Griffin's paper goes on to say that these results hold for substitution of copper atoms into the Pb(1) location in the lead apatite structure, as reported by the original preprints, but that her calculations suggest that substitution into another location, Pb(2) seems to be energetically more favorable, \"suggesting possible difficulties in robustly obtaining Cu substituted on the Pb(1) site\". This then would be a source of variability in reproducing LK-99, or at the very least in getting a particularly clean bulk sample of it.Meanwhile, as mentioned the Shenyang group has very similar conclusions (as they should; both they and Griffin are using the same DFT software package!) The starting lead apatite is a very good insulator, but the structural changes on bringing in the copper atom both match the experimental data from the Korean preprints and lead to a very large shift to a metallic state. They find a half-filled flat band and a fully-occupied flat band around the Fermi level, and agree that these are crucial to investigate for the reported superconductivity. They also predict that substituting gold atoms into the Pb(1) site could lead to a material with very similar properties, which will be an extremely interesting idea to put to the test. Here's more from their preprint:In addition, the PO4 units surrounding the cylindrical column formed by Pb2 atoms also exhibit insulating characteristics, leading to a one-dimensional-like conduction channel along the c axis mediated by the 1/4-occupied O2 atoms. More interestingly, we observed four VHSs on these two flat bands, originating from the saddle dispersions at the M and L points in the Brillouin zone [see Figs. 2(e), (f) and (g)]. This indicates that the electronic properties are fragile in response to structural distortions at low temperatures.They don't go into the possible lower-energy substitution at the Pb(2) site, but the above warning about fragile electronic properties might also explain some of the variability in the behavior of the material (although it has to be balanced with the original report of superconductivity up past the temperature of boiling water!) It also highlights something that occurred to me when I read the original preprints: if you could grow a good single crystal of LK-99, it seems as if the superconductivity might only occur along one crystal axis: put crudely, you'd see superconductivity if you hooked your wires to two particular opposite faces of said crystal, but not to the others! Crystalline grain boundaries are already known to be a big deal in the efficiency of existing superconducting materials, and this would mean that polycrystalline samples of LK-99 would be pretty unfavorable to demonstrating robust effects.ConclusionI am guardedly optimistic at this point. The Shenyang and Lawrence Berkeley calculations are very positive developments, and take this well out of the cold-fusion \"we can offer no explanation\" territory. Not that there's anything wrong with new physics (!), but it sets a much, much higher bar if you have to invoke something in that range. I await more replication data, and with more than just social media videos backing them up. This is by far the most believable shot at room-temperature-and-pressure superconductivity the world has seen so far, and the coming days and weeks are going to be extremely damned interesting.ABOUT THE AUTHOR Derek Lowe emailDerek Lowe, an Arkansan by birth, got his BA from Hendrix College and his PhD in organic chemistry from Duke before spending time in Germany on a Humboldt Fellowship on his post-doc.

    "commentBody": "A room-temperature superconductor? New developments (science.org)1083 points by nneonneo 1716 commentsjtchang 1The ramifications of the inflection point we are currently at is mind boggling. I had a hard time explaining this last night but we may very well be witnessing the beginnings of a technological transformation era much like when the p-n junction was invented. From the 1940s standpoint it would be hard to envision all we had today.- Lossless transport of energy - Batteries that don't take any time to recharge - Faster CPUs. Much faster with no heat to burn your lap.Can I have my flying car now?replyfsh 1None of the things you listed are limited by the conductors in them. The efficiency of high voltage AC power lines is limited by capacitive coupling to ground. Battery charging is limited by the cell chemistry. CPU heat output is limited by the resistance of the semiconductors.Turns out metals (in particular copper) are already incredibly good conductors.replynwiswell root | > CPU heat output is limited by the resistance of the semiconductors.This is not true anymore. At leading edge process nodes (i.e., smaller conductor pitch), the bulk resistivity of copper changes dramatically because it is increasingly dominated by ballistic electron scattering on the interfaces and grain boundaries: surface area has decreased as a fraction of volume and the average grain size has shrunk to fit inside the interconnect lines.Alternative metals like Cobalt and Ruthenium have been proposed and to some extent used in production as an alternative to Cu for the low interconnect layers, but they just arrest the trend -- the fact is that the interconnect resistance is much higher than it used to be.It's also why a lot of the big players like TSMC and Intel are investing heavily in backside power delivery.Here is an accessible article on the topic:https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/backside-power-deliver...(Also: high-voltage DC power is commonly used for long-range transmission and does not have coupling issues)replyTaniwha root | Yes RC wire delays have becoming more important than gate capacitance for a couple of decades now - if R goes to 0 RC delays do tooreplywhatshisface root | I guess the next limiting factor would be LC delays.replythrowawaylinux root | No it pretty much is true, well it's the power draw from switching transistors and from leakage losses.Resistance in the metal wires is not so much a problem for power as it is for signal propagation delay. That is the biggest problem with R skyrocketing in M0/1.And backside power delivery is to relieve congestion in the interconnects. That's typically one of the limiting factors in complex logic designs now, transistor densities of under 70% aren't uncommon.That's what \"Removing the power signal and signal line to just a signal line would free up space for more transistors.\" line is about in the link. Power delivery losses aren't nothing, but they aren't a big fraction of energy in today's CPUs.Eliminating most wire delay would be a huge benefit though, and could be a pretty big revolution. Not just within the core or on the die. You're still going to have to switch those transistors and burn current on leakage though, so no cold CPUs just yet.replytomxor root | > CPU heat output is limited by the resistance of the semiconductors.Technically true but not applicable... Super conducting CPUs already exist (at below room temp), and they don't use semiconductors. They don't have an exact transistor equivalent but use digital logic circuits such as Quantum Flux Parametron (QFP) and rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ), which are comprised of Josephson Junctions [0] which are made from the same super conducting material. Relying on quantum effects of a gap between two conductors rather than specific material properties.So while it is true that CMOS are limited by the resistance of both the conductor interconnects AND the semiconductors. Super conducting circuits only appear to need a conductor... There are other drawbacks, such as larger feature sizes due to the nature of super conducting materials, and QFP and RSFQ might be more complex? but this is potentially offset by huge advantages: zero resistance buys not only power efficiency and minimum heat generation (as required by landauer limit), but also allows circuits to be driven at a higher clock, so far demonstrated to 770GHz for one CPU [1][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect[1] https://spectrum.ieee.org/superconductor-logic-goes-lowpowerreplythrowawaylinux root | > so far demonstrated to 770GHz for one CPUThat's not a CPU, it's a simple circuit. From the article, \"Simple superconducting logic circuits have been shown to operate at speeds of up to 770 gigahertz.\"Exotic semiconductor transistors can switch that fast, record being over 800GHz I think. Regular transistors of the type in your phone can probably do around 200-300GHz. Not to say there could not be revolutionary designs opened up with superconducting wires or switches, just the switching speed itself doesn't necessarily tell us one way or the other.replydumdumchan root | It might be possible to create a new kind of transistor that turns on/off by changing the superconductivity of the conducting material.replycogman10 root | > The efficiency of high voltage AC power lines is limited by capacitive coupling to ground.And to this point, HVDC has been slowly rising as a viable alternative beyond just undersea transmission.A mistaken belief is that AC is more efficient than DC. What AC is is more easy to transform from one voltage to another (until somewhat recently). That makes it easier to run AC at 1 MV and then step it down to 240V for residential applications.The cost is as AC voltage goes up, capacitive resistance increases. This is part of the reason why high voltage lines have such huge towers with the lines far apart.An HVDC line, however, can be put underground (or water) without suffering power losses. It's voltage can go well above that of AC voltages with the only limit being how much insulation we need for the line.Super conductors are nice, but only in the \"now we can run 1 billion amps at 100V\" sense to avoid the capactive resistance. Without any sort of special materials you get most of the benefits of super conductors by using HVDC. The only real downside is high voltage DC is still super dangerous. Cut the insulation and you've got something that can arc meters whereas a superconductor at lower voltages would be about the same danger as any other conductor at lower voltages.replyheisenzombie root | Minor nitpick — \"now we can run 1 billion amps at 100V\" — there is a limit to how much current you can put down a superconductor. For example I think commercial YBCO superconductor tape will do roughly 1000A/mm^2 (and even that requires being significantly below its critical temperature).That’s a pretty high current density compared to what’s feasible with copper — don’t get me wrong — but a billion amps would still require a pretty huge cable even with a superconductor.replytomxor root | Presumably everything in the chain, every junction, would also need to be a pure super conductor? Anything else would be susceptible to instantly melting or vaporising.So unless someone comes up with super conducting welding I guess that would mean no junctions.replyjader201 root | > - Lossless transport of energy - Batteries that don't take any time to recharge - Faster CPUs. Much faster with no heat to burn your lap.Finally someone is speaking English in these room-temperature superconductor threads that I can actually understand and get excited about!> None of the things you listed are limited by the conductors in them.Never mind. :(replymNovak 1root | In the RF world (particularly at mm-wave frequencies), even copper has very non-negligible losses. In most passive circuits conductor loss is the limiting factor of performance. No idea if this material retains the same properties at such frequencies, and is compatible with typical lithography or other fabrication techniques, but it'd be amazing if so.replynamibj root | Particle accelerators sometimes use superconducting niobium resonators at e.g. 1.8K offering a Q of 5e10 at 1.3 GHz. But apparently their surface resistance scales with the square of frequency, unlike the square root in normal copper.So maybe just just t normal conductors like copper, silver, graphene (assuming the latter can be commercially made to surpass silver in RF surface resistance).replysheepscreek root | But it is. A significant part of electronics engineering is dedicated to heat dissipation.So what do we stand to gain?At least a slight improvement in efficiency of transmission. And a huge improvement due to simpler heat dissipation needs.So this might mean way faster battery charging - like 500 miles worth of charge in 5 mins. We’re mainly limited by how hot the batteries get during charging.replyBeldin root | We're about halfway there already, just by cooling: 250km in under 4 min (1).(1) https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/13-07-20...replysoligern root | We’re not talking about charging existing batteries but superconductors where you just “trap” large amounts of electricity in the superconductor for future use.replyvagab0nd 1root | > Battery charging is limited by the cell chemistry.Yes, but superconductors don't have that limitation, do they? You just dump current into them.replymminer237 1root | They have low losses when storing power, but power has to be stored in the magnetic field. They have a limit on acceptable magnetic field strength called the critical field though, above which it stops being a superconductor and bad things™ happen. Current SMES systems have an energy density of about ¹⁄₅₀th of current Li-ion batteries.replyvagab0nd 1root | You are right about the energy density and limitations. I was more focused on the fast rate of storage and retrieval.replytherein root | We already have incredible supercapacitors.https://www.eaton.com/gb/en-gb/catalog/electronic-components...I have 4 at home and blows people's minds when you melt a wire with it. Incredible rapid current delivery.replyXorNot root | They don't store any meaningful amount of electricity (which is why they haven't supplanted Li-Ion batteries for power tools) and more importantly they have a cycle-life - they degrade from usage (source: my wife works for a supercapacitor manufacturer).You also get losses from practical usage - i.e. no one can build a 3V supercapacitor that has decent endurance (you can totally build one which will work, but you're rating it knowing that every cycle is damaging it).replyskykooler root | Why do cycles damage supercapacitors? My understanding is that in batteries this is caused by ions not returning to their original spot in the electrodes, but I thought only the electrons moved in capacitors?replyinportb root | Overlooking the cell chemistry issue...... you cannot just dump unlimited current through a superconductor. Once you exceed the critical current density, your superconductor becomes a regular conductor.replymytailorisrich root | And in any case whatever power source you're using cannot deliver infinite power.replytmpX7dMeXU root | Who said infinite power?replyqsdf38100 root | It's implied by instant charging. The power would be the battery capacity divided by 0.replysharlos201068 root | No one means literally zero time to charge. A couple seconds compared to minutes or hours is virtually instant for practical purposes.replyqsdf38100 root | Let me keep being pedantic and notice that a typical phone capacity of 10000 Joules divided by 2 seconds is still 5 kW of power, so not a trivial amount. I'd think 30 seconds (333 Watts) is more realistic.replyDenote6737 root | If we can even get the charge times for EVs down to the minutes to take to refill ICE tanks. It will basically remove the range anxiety problem.replymytailorisrich root | Best way to get EV 'refill' time to minutes is battery swapping. This already exists commercially, see Nio in China, and it apparently takes as little as 3 minutes.Similar speeds for charging are impractical because of the power spikes required even if the battery could take it.You cannot have instant charging, that's not pedantic, that's the discussion, and in any case there is a practical limit to how fast it can happen for similar reasons.All the work being done on smart home EV chargers that automatically schedule the right time (controlled by grid) to charge overnight are because even at current speeds this wreaks havoc on the electrical subsystems and grid if everyone plug their EVs in at the same time in the evening...replysoligern root | That’s pedantic. No one means literal instant charging, just figuratively.replygalangalalgol root | Also the thing will be a really strong magnet while it is storing energy. Even if it doesn't rip itself apart it will stick to stuff amd lose energy.replyjrockway 1root | Are you thinking of supercapacitors?replydfox 1root | There is a theory that with room temperature superconductors you could use an inductor for practical energy storage.replybananapub root | what are the practicalities of storing enormous magnetic fields and then collapsing them to draw power? that seems...not obviously a good idea.replydfox root | Well, exactly. While there is a way of getting some of the stored energy as an controlled power, most of the failure modes of such a thing leads to uncontrolled release of the stored energy, manifested by the whole thing just somewhat instantaneously turning into very hot gas.replycivilitty 1root | He's thinking of superconducting magnetic energy storage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_magnetic_energ...Currently they're only feasible as high quality power sources for fabs and other industrial uses because of the operating costs of cooling the superconductors.replyjacquesm 1root | Also used for grid stabilization.replyentropicdrifter root | So superconductor supercapacitorsreplyheisenzombie root | More like superinductors than supercapacitors - the energy is stored in a magnetic field (inductor) and not an electric field (capacitor)replynextaccountic 1root | > CPU heat output is limited by the resistance of the semiconductors.Can't superconductor help here?replyTaniwha root | Only a little, one big limitation in chips is RC wire delays (the distributed capacitance along a wire needs to be charged/discharged for a signal change to pass) - due to edge effects capacitance doesn't scale with the area of the wire - but R does (inversely so wires have gotten slower) - so as chips have got denser wires have not got faster at the same rate, when I first started building chips we mostly only cared about gate capacitances - now RC delays are a big deal - if R went to 0 RC delays would too - things would get fasterreplySharlin 1root | Superconducting semiconductors? I doubt such a thing is possible.replyweard_beard 1root | Doubt no more. Its called a Josephson junction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effectreplyanonymous_sorry 1root | It's not obvious to me how it could. Transistors require a semiconductor.replydisintegore 1root | To my knowledge, computers can be designed without any transistorsreplyentropicdrifter root | They can, but then you're talking about a totally different physical scale of computer. Transistors are useful because we know how to shrink them to a scale of nanometers, in particular we know exactly how to do that with transistors printed with lasers onto silicon chips. We'd have to reboot the CPU manufacturing industry with new base materials/technologies.It's hyper-specialized tech, so it'd probably take over a decade from now to be seen in useful, everyday technologies.replyXorNot root | Superconducting powerlines would be able to transport DC electricity with 0% losses. To put this in context: you could put solar panels in California, and send every watt of power to Alaska or New York, while losing nothing in the transport.replycontravariant root | Yeah at those kinds of scales I get doubtful. At those scales the electrical fields themselves begin to exert inertia on things, to the point that you could cut most power lines and they wouldn't stop catastrophically, they'd continue catastrophically (a problem that only gets worse with superconductors, as happened to CERN when they accidentally vaporised a length of superconductor that had become conductive).It could definitely open up the road to long distance high capacity power lines, but somewhere along the line reality is going to make things difficult. It's not magic after all, just sufficiently advanced technology.replysoligern root | You could bury them or have very high overhead lines. Being able to have near instantaneous, lossless energy transfer would make it worth it (minus whatever impediment the GOP tries to put in the way to bolster gas/oil, but that’s just political).replyburnished root | Could you spot me a link to that CERN incident or on the topic of superconductors becoming conductive (looooool)? All I got for CERN was reports about gas leaks but I find myself very curious about the way superconductors fail nowreplycontravariant root | Here is their own article on the incident: https://home.cern/news/press-release/cern/cern-releases-anal...Doesn't sound too spectacular but it took them over a year to fix all the damage.replyKarrot_Kream root | The superconducting effect of LK99 seems to top out at around 150 mA / cm^2. Maybe more research will bear fruit here, but for now we're not looking at HVDC lines.replymarshray root | To my knowledge, that number from the original researchers and no one has yet independently verified it.External researchers have not even begun to purify and test the limits of this material.replyjojobas root | >The efficiency of high voltage AC power lines is limited by capacitive coupling to ground.As often in engineering, the sweet spot is where multiple factors have ~equal contributions, so even a 50% win in one of the factors can't give you that much benefit.For high voltage AC power lines it's Ohmic losses, corona discharge losses, and inductive losses.replyklysm 1> Batteries that don't take any time to rechargeHuh? Is this actually a thing that this enables? I don't initially see howreplymarcosdumay 1root | Nah, the GP is just completely out of reality.We won't see lossless transmission in a very long time, and no place where an aluminum cable is too expensive today will become viable because something a million times more expensive is 9% more efficient.Batteries won't see a revolution because of this, there's simply no reason for them to (but they are currently in a revolution, and there are more to come). AC storage in the superconductor will probably be the most expensive storage mechanism you can buy, and flywheels will keep having atrocious energy density, they won't even get twice as good. But it will completely revolutionize some niches in storage.This won't replace metal layers in CPU for a really long time. Superconductors are hard enough to make, CPUs are absurdly hard to make, and the wins on power savings aren't very large. If people make superconducting chips, it will be ones where the superconductors do active switching, what is much farther away and can enable much faster CPUs too.I really wish people would stop repeating those. If you are going out of your way for an outlandish claim, I'm much more interested on discussing if this can replace rockets for near Earth space travel than those absurd costly low gain things.replyNovaDudely root | They way I have described this is like the Wright brothers have just demonstrated the first power flight, and we are already planning the schedule for the A330's from LA to London.It is exciting stuff but there is a very long way to go if true.replysomerandomqaguy root | >This won't replace metal layers in CPU for a really long time. Superconductors are hard enough to make, CPUs are absurdly hard to make, and the wins on power savings aren't very large. If people make superconducting chips, it will be ones where the superconductors do active switching, what is much farther away and can enable much faster CPUs too.I would've thought the main wins would've been reduced heat generation. Like you said, power savings would be negligible. But at the data center scale I'd imagine that reduced heat would result in reduced air conditioning power costs. And potentially with thermal constraints removed, it would allow for more compact packaging per server as well.Like you said though, I doubt it would happen any time soon.replymarcosdumay root | You can start to get to the answer if you look why metal layers aren't made with silver. If metal resistivity was that important, nobody would pass the chance of almost doubling the conductivity with a much smaller change than people are proposing here.The reason they don't is because yeild is the one most important variable on the entire process. And silver adds enough complexity to decrease it. (A few chips do have silver layers. People manage to use them when the process is mature enough and the added complexity gets tamed. Including something like YBCO into a high-performance chips manufacturing process is a half-a-century project; LK-99 can't even be reliably done yet.)replycogman10 root | > I would've thought the main wins would've been reduced heat generation.Most of the heat in a data center is coming from power burned in the devices themselves not the power transmission to those devices.Sort of like how a space heater is hot at the heater portion, not the power cable going into the heater.You aren't losing more than a W or so to transmission for every kW of power delivered. (in fact, you are generating more heat from the AC->DC transformation)Typically, power cords and wiring is 15 AWG, which has a 10 milli-ohm/meter resistance and runs as 120V AC (maximum of 15->20A). So, 1000m of power cord running at full load would result in 150->200W of heat from the power cable. Meanwhile the server is generating 1.6->2.2kW of heat. (Assuming a single very long 1kM route is servicing the server).Cut the cabling distance to a couple of meters and you can see why nobody worries at power consumption at that point.replysomerandomqaguy root | I meant in the integrated circuits rather then power supply.replycrooked-v root | > something a million times more expensiveLanarkite and copper phosphide aren't expensive, other than the government controls on red phosphorous (because it can be used to make meth).replyrowanG077 root | It's interesting you are saying superconductors are hard to make because... if this one really is a superconductor it's pretty easy to make. YBCO is also not particularly hard to make either.replyXorNot root | The semiconductor industry is also very happy to do hard things for marginal gains. They've spent a decade swapping out semiconductor junction materials at enormous expense because there's no other option.The idea that reducing power consumption is also not large enough to matter is...yeah, detached from reality. Thermal density has been an enormous problem with increasing CPU feature densities. CPUs already run hotter then a kitchen hot-plate, which is why so much effort has been put into dynamic throttling and other tricks - you straight up can't run CPU circuit elements full-power for very long without the risk of frying them, or requiring a cooling system which is impractical for widespread deployment.replyderefr 1root | Resistance is what makes things hot, and heat is what makes dumping huge amounts of charge current into batteries a bad idea. No resistance → no heat → no need to charge with low current†.Another way to say it is that, with a superconducting wire, you can make the wire as thin as you want and still pass the same amount of current through it, without melting the wire. Picture using a USB-C cable to charge your car.† (There'd still be a current limit due to the heat generated by the chemical reaction that rebuilds the battery's voltage potential... if said reaction is exothermic. Some battery chemistries are endothermic when charging!)replyninkendo 1root | I’m not an expert on this, but I think superconducting wires have an current limit, as a current flowing creates a magnetic field which the superconductor has to repel. I read that the paper states a very low current limit for LK-99, meaning it loses superconductivity once a very modest amount of current is passed through it.replymitthrowaway2 1root | It's hard to tell what the critical current density of LK-99 is, because their sample is porous and probably very impure. They measured the critical current they could pass through a sample, but the conducting cross-section is somewhat unknown. Its high critical temperature suggests that it should probably have a higher current capacity than other superconductors. That said, in the extremes, current density is also limited by tensile strength, because electromagnetic coils repel themselves.replykeepamovin root | Couldn’t you bind it in resin?replyMelatonic 1root | That is.....kind of a huge limitation of the technology lol. Still very cool but less hypereplythorncorona 1root | I believe the implication is that LK-99 is basically a demonstration of an entire class of materials which should have room-temp superconduction properties. IE we can enumerate through the entire class and find the ones with the properties we want.replyPBnFlash 1root | There is no reason to assume that even if it's real.In fact, the tight tolerances of this seem to indicate the opposite.replythorncorona 1root | At least according to this wikipedia chart on superconductor discovery timelines[1], it seems like most discoveries aren't one-off.I have no knowledge in this area though.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_superconductivity#/...replyazernik 1root | A limitation...at ambient temperature and pressure.Usually this is an optimization frontier, where something that has tetchy critical current/field at high temperature is going to have very good critical current/field at the same temperature as a lower-Tc superconductor.If it superconducts at all at room temp, cooling it down even to 200K (about dry ice temp - quite cheap to do) could get you something very usable.replyjacquesm 1root | > you can make the wire as thin as you wantNo, superconductors have a specific current above which they stop superconducting so you will want to stay away from that limit. This particular superconductor has been presented with a very low Ic (150 mA in the original paper0 which would not make it particularly useful in such applications but future iterations (assuming it is all true) may improve on that (they should otherwise we have the equivalent of a superconducting straw).replyfallingknife 1root | I assume this would rule out things like fusion reactors, MRIs, and other high energy stuff. Would it still be revolutionary tech with a 150 mA limit?replyjacquesm 1root | Yes, it would be upending just about everything because the race would be on to improve on that. Think of it this way: once you show that something is possible at all there will be substantial funding available to improve on it. As long as you can't show that it is possible at all you're on your own. So if it works and that 150 mA is the limit then you can expect a ton of effort to be expended to improve on that and I fully expect those improvements not to take decades to show up. The more interesting question is if it really is that low of a limit what the reason is for that and I don't recall seeing any explanation so far.On another note: a superconductor that can only do 150 mA / cm^2 seems intuitively strange, as though that figure is somehow off, it's a gigantic cross section for such a small current. It is very well possible that this is somehow an error in the reporting or an actual measurement on a thin sample with small cross section. So there are many explanations possible and only one of those is a true limit of the material.replyXorNot root | The current hypothesis is that most likely whatever they made is not a pure sample of the material which actually superconducts - this is expected, since when you make YBCO superconductors you also tend to get low yields (i.e. ~20%) that actually superconduct.So it could be the whole sample, or it could one micron-sized link of grains of whatever the \"real\" material is running through the sample.replyChabsff 1root | Superconductors also have an inherent current limit above which they go back to having a resistance.replyjrockway 1root | There are many things that seem like electrical resistance but are different phenomena. Capacitive reactance, inductance, \"radiation resistance\", etc. Superconductors don't prevent any of these effects. But, these effects are usually smaller than ordinary resistance.replycogman10 root | Heat from power transfer is not the problem with current battery tech. We are already capable of delivering 350kW worth of power into EV batteries. The limiting factor is not the power cable delivering that power.Thick cable, high voltage (900V typically) and everything is fairly manageable. Assuming we could consistently charge at that 350kW we could fully (0->100%) charge an 80kWh ev battery in 13 minutes. That's not slow.The limiting factor is the battery chemistry, not the wire chemistry.replypostmodest 1root | Wouldn't the battery itself still have resistance? Or is the superconducting material itself a battery?replyderefr 1root | Depends. A single battery cell would have nontrivial resistance, yes.But a big bank of batteries, like are in an EV? Very hard to give them enough current to heat them up. Most of the \"heat problem\" is from the bottlenecked current path into the car; once you fan out across all the individual cells, each individual cell isn't receiving much current.And a bank of supercapacitors? You could charge it effectively instantly.replyfsh 1root | The current is limited by what the battery chemistry can take, not by the cables. This is why the first 80% can be charged quite fast in modern EVs, and the last 20% are really slow.replyhighwaylights 1root | Additionally you need to have the current to deliver in the first place. Having a grid that can dump 25-100 kwh into any given car in a couple of minutes is no small task if everyone is doing it.replyjacquesm 1root | The utilization factor would obviously be much lower than it would be if everybody charges at a lower rate so if the total amount of energy is equal that just means that individual vehicles will spend less time charging, and the grid will see - roughly - identical utilization on average but the peaks may be higher.replyburnished root | Probably worth pointing out that the peaks and troughs are what are challenging to deal with. Generators aren't generally great at changing output super fast.I keep hearing battery tech is getting good, and the research I've seen suggests that more storage on the grid would improve efficiency by a lot, so I don't know if it would even pose a particular challenge if that sort of demand arose.. but overall utilization isn't really the limiting reagent.replyarmarr 1root | Sure, it would make the wiring smaller and more efficient. But I also don't see how it would help in the chemical energy transfer to charge the battery.replyderefr 1root | What I was trying to say is, with some battery chemistries, the current (heh) limiting step for charging speed is the wiring into, and of, the battery, rather than the safe reaction speed of the battery chemistry itself. We could safely \"crank the chemistry\" by an order-of-magnitude or more if we could get the desired current into the battery without the wires+electrodes conducting undue amounts of heat into the electrolyte.replytigershark 1root | No, it’s not. It’s the chemical reaction the limit. In li-ion for example you will create dendrites when charging/discharging too fast or too deep. This is the cause of the relatively short cycle life.replydanudey 1root | According to the paper, this material stops superconducting at about 150mA per cm^2 of diameter, meaning that a 1cm-thick cable made of this material could conduct up to 150mA before the current is too much and it stops superconducting.If my math is correct, then for a basic 500mA USB device, that would mean a cable a bit over 3 cm^2 in cross-sectional area, or about 2 cm across (for each of the power and ground leads, at least).Alternately, a cable of just over 1/2cm in diameter (for power and ground, each) could charge a rechargable Ni-MH AA battery in about 12 hours and 40 minutes.Tl;DR this is absolutely revolutionary science, if true, but we're definitely Not There Yet.replybaq 1root | It’s a zero resistance wire.

At best that usually means you might get your recycling picked up for free or with reduced additional charges, but for the average person in the U.S. paper recycing is not worthwhile at an individual scale. Apparently it pays something around $50-$75 a ton, which isn't nothing, and might be worth doing in some locales, but I have to imagine the logistics of moving material of that weight on a regular basis to where it can be accepted means there are much more lucrative materials to harvest (either it's a long haul for most people, or I imagine middle men accepting it locally and transferring it are going to take a large cut).replycthalupa root | I don't understand how your comment implies a lack of subsidy, it only states that the people harvesting the material can make money off of it.

At PRC scale, activing fraction of population to high skill is enough to compete with US+co, and PRC's fraction of that high skill talent is set to increase multiple times over coming decades. There's a reason why PRC moving from ~2M STEM to ~20M STEM grew economy from 1T to 19T and is at close to parity / at parity / even leading in full spectrum of industrial sectors whereas \"small\" countries like JP and SKR has to pick and choose where to compete. With PRC population they can do everything, and in fact can't not considering they're graduating ~5M STEM per year and will add more STEM (50-100M) than US will add population in next 30 years. PRC is not JP and SKR, and TW, it's on trend to be 4-6x JP+SKR+TW without the geopolitical constraints that prevent US partners from full competition against US in critical strategic industries.>comfirmed falsifyingHere's a more rigours NBER light study on PRC GDP being underestimated by much more accomplished economists aka not retarded like Martinez study.https://www.nber.org/papers/w23323Here's a more comprehensive GDP resconstruction by Rhodium, leading economic search group that focus on PRC that also reports underestimation, ~10% by 2014. Including work by David Dollar, one of the more competent PRC economic analyst at Brookings that also led discussion of your second link, noting it had 2 models of over estimation and went with the much higher overestimation model vs the lower (basically marginal amount) one that was probably more correct.https://www.csis.org/analysis/broken-abacusNo one takes PRC GDP reporting at face value, but anyone with half a brain can see PRC climbing western science and innovation indexes (controlled for quality), moving up global value chain, displacing other advanced economies in increasing amount of intermediate and final goods and doing all that rapidly in last 10 years that US basically needs to go full spectrum containment beyond what they did for USSR while acknowledge PRC is greater challenge then USSR ever was. Anyone with half a brain can also napkin math future skilled workforce between US @35M STEM + ~600K per year, vs PRC @20M STEM ~5M (M as in million) per year and understand PRC will have more STEM workforce than US in a few years, and possibly 2-3x more STEM by 2050 even factoring in PRC demographics. Cut that in half and PRC's future potential is still outrageous.E: over post limit>China classification of STEM graduates isn't directly comparable to the rest of the world - see [1] Using western criteria it would be around 1-2 not 4-5 million per year.[1] doesn't say anything other than US doesn't like PRC definition of STEM. Even using NSF trends, PRC @1.4M equivalent STEM in 2014 with +100k per year is still outproducing US by factor of 2-3. Note my ranges of 50-100M STEM by 2050 (lower bound assumes 2M*26yrs or ~50M STEM, US population projected to increase 40M) and comment that even 1/2ing current PRC STEM makes PRC more than competitive.>Accounting for these differences India has more STEM graduates than China.Ignoring this is NSF using 2014 data where PRC somehow produces 3x more doctoral degrees than India yet less S&E degrees despite PRC having higher literacy rate and more well funded education system... There's a reason I note \"relatively proven ability to coordinate talent\". India has solid tertiary system but inability extra economic productivity out of talent. A few years ago they were bragging about having most women in STEM despite having declining female work force particapation (from already low levels).>roughly comparable in quantity but not in quality.Clearly quality since PRC is rapidly moving up rankings in western science and innovation indexes controlled for quality.>Fun fact. Poor mediocre Poland with ~40 million people has 19 Noble prizes.Pointless fact... PRC had developed tertiary education and well resourced R&D system from how many of the last 120 years of Nobel Prize existence? Nevermind Nobel Prize / Norway not on good terms with PRC because they like to give PRC dissidents Peace Prize. Or that only fraction of Polish Nobels from science... most from diaphoras for work not done in western institution. If we're going to be extra pedantic, Polish Institue hasn't won a single post soviet science prize.>I won't mention Israel or serious western powers.No, you don't need to, because apart from US, literally none of them measures up to recent aggregate measures of PRC S&T / R&D in broad spectrum indexes / rankings. Like there's 1st/2nd place between US/PRC, or PRC/US depending on indicators, literally everyone else is distant 3rd+ that they're not even in contention.replyyafbum root | Japan and South Korea are allies of the US. They are also much too small in population and resources to reach a level of economic power that would allow them to do anything on their own.The Chinese Communist party has the resources, people and determination to follow a different course. It might underperform relative to its size, and the one-child policy is going to cause a disastrous demographic situation, but even if you consider just coastal, urban China, that's getting pretty close to US in terms of people and economic power. The communist party is developing its military capabilities at a fast clip, and fusing its military and civilian economies to accelerate its technical development. Where almost every other government has been unable to wrestle control of Internet information, the Chinese Communist party has successfully turned its version of the Internet into an effective tool of govt propaganda and social control.In other words, there are lots and lots of very concrete reasons to believe that the post-development trajectory of China can be very different from Japan's or South Korea's.replybirdyrooster 1root | > It's fashionable to talk about China taking overIt's not so much fashionable as it is literally state propaganda used to try and shoulder its way into the South China Sea and the Pacific by claiming it is so prosperous and populous that it is entitled to increasingly large sphere of influence and direct control.replybirdyrooster root | apologies for abusing the pronoun itreplywhimsicalism 1root | > it's seriously underachieving not only compared to US, but even compared to the rest of the developed world.This statement would have been viewed as absolutely obvious and ridiculous 2 decades ago.

As this cohort has aged and are now in retirement, Japan's economic performance has tailed off.See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Japan#/media/F...If you look at the Chinese population pyramid, we could already be at the point of maximum Chinese economic growth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_China#/media/F...From the geopolitical standpoint, this may also explain why China and Russia have become more belligerent - they will lack sufficient numbers of young fighting aged men in the next few decades.replywhimsicalism 1root | The difference with the Japan case is that China is going to have a larger base of young, very well educated people than the US for at least the next century unless something changes dramatically with either birth rates or immigration.replyrobot_no_421 root | China is facing severe demographic issues for the next 20-30 years due to their terribly short sighted one-child policy and their poor immigration rates. Literally the opposite of what you're saying. Where on earth did you get your facts from?replywhimsicalism root | With the population edge they have, they will still have more young people than us. More of their output will have to go for caring for the elderly, but that will scale with technology.replyrobot_no_421 root | Why does having a large population matter? If you look at the top 10 countries in terms of population (China, India, US, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russia, Mexico), most of those places are not exactly heavyweights on the international scene.There are so many factors that contribute more to economic and political success than sheer population. I would even say that a large population is a bad thing in many cases. India would be better off with fewer people. Their infrastructure can't handle their density, they don't have enough jobs for their educated workers, there's a lot of sectarianism conflict between various religions and casts, etc.High population + low GDP per capita is probably the worst situation a country can be in IMO. So it's not enough for China to have a billion people—those people have to be doing something productive for the economy.replydirtyid root | Not Zeihan tier demographic analysis which is a start.PRC currently generating ~5m STEM per year, aka OECD combined, multiple times more than US has ability to train or brain drain. And relatively proven ability to coordinate talent. Project that out next 20-30s from previous 20-30 years of birth rate and PRC on trend to add 50M-100M STEM to workforce, just STEM, not including other skilled workers, which is the greatest high skill demographic divident in recorded history. Literally no country in the world, at any time in the past or projected future has better demographics for actual global competition than PRC in the next 30 years. Including India who will have more people, but have all the issues you noted that will likely prevent them from actually coordinating human capita enmass successfully in the time it takes their youth demographic divident to expire.Contrary to naive PRC demographic pyramid bomb arguments that doesn't address what you correctly note below - quality of human capita. By 2050, PRC is going to add more STEM talent than US is projected to increase population. All the news of PRC climbing up value chains, leading in science and innovation indexes from last few years? Or moving from 1T to 18T economy. Done by growing STEM from ~2M to ~17M STEM exploited via industrial policy that west is now copying. PRC is moving from workforce with 25% skilled talent to 60/70/80 of modern economies with 60% and increasing tertiary education rate that biases towards science will look weak on per capita stats due to huge existing cohort of old / undereducated, but it absolute terms it's a demographic advantage no country currently has conditions to remotely rival. Then note how net population decline will reduce resource dependency and you basically have the most optimal mix of demographic trend for PRC with respect to geopolitical competition.Are those demographic issues difficult to govern/manage? Yes, but they're also close to ideal conditions for improving comprehensive national power within PRC's constraints. PRC's big population = with big demographic curse but also big demographic divident post 2050s. But they don't cancel each other out. Likelt follow JP/SKR trend where TFR collapsed in the 80s/90s but GDP increased 500% because workforce was net gaining skilled/productive people, while losing unskilled. JP (and later SKR) are/will only entering process of real stagnation when TFR cannot replace level of skilled labour at parity. Which for PRC is a post 2050 problem and even then countries will be competing with a PRC roughly 3-5x larger than now.On the actual demographic curse of aging, the blessings of huge segment of PRC old getting old before they get rich is there simply isn't going to be high expectations for advanced economy levels of welfare and social support. There's a reason PRC has 90% (96% in rural where poor concentrates) home ownership and very high household savings rate. Old expects to weather most of retirement without substantial state support and increasingly family support since they don't want to burden future gens. If you look at JP, old are basically rotting/dying alone, unceremoniously. In JP it's called Kodokushi, in SKR, it's godoksa, it's happening in HK as well. In households that pressure young for support, you know what the east-asian human response to that is? Being miserable whiel working even harder. Half the reason JP/SKR/TW lead in high end industries they currently dominate is because those societies have resigned to working 100% harder for 10% competitve advantage.replywhimsicalism 1root | They do not need that many years of large growth to overtake the US in terms of size.

Adding insult to injury is they then take that success and just wholesale buy the doors the US keeps closing.A surefire way to lose Pax Americana is to become delusional that Pax Americana is winning when by all accounts it's losing and losing hard.

They haven't yet been able to build institutions with the staff, structure, and culture needed. That will likely change in time, but at present the best Chinese scientists are still coming to the USA to work, and staying here. Despite the USA having a lot more research output, a substantial fraction of the top scientists in the USA are from China.My Chinese colleagues tell me that the bureaucracy and authoritarianism in Chinese institutions puts a lot of hurdles in place when trying to do research. Simply buying equipment, hiring staff, etc. is a nightmare, and results in \"evaporative cooling\" where the top researchers with the option to work anywhere don't tolerate this and leave.Edit: I will also add that in some sense US academia is supported by overcharging Chinese students for tuition. If and when Chinese institutions get to the point where the best students want to stay there, there will be a huge crisis in US universities, possibly being unable to support tenured staff.replydirtyid 1root | Varies by field but last few years PRC been reaching parity to topping various science and innovation indexes, PRC institutions also breaking global top100 and general trend of moving up rankings. TLDR is PRC science exploded after mid 2010s - lag effect from academic reform in 00s. Biotech/bioeconomy a outlier though - just got elevated to strategic sector with 500b usd investment in last year's 5 year plan, so expect PRC to start being competitive in 5-10 years.> at present the best Chinese scientists are still coming to the USA to workIMO not true anymore. This isn't pre 00s where PRC send best abroad as part of state strategy and best have some english fluency because it's needed for science. More and more PRC best aren't English fluent since there's sufficiently large and growing chinese science ecosystem and best also have good access to resources in tier1 labs. Hence US cracking down on 1000 talents program where PRC entice scientists to work in PRC due to unparallel resources. Or acadmeic exchanges with PRC in general. Also see stats of record amount of scientists returning to PRC this yearm>best students want to stay there,Best PRC students go to PRC C9 (Ivy equivalent) now. Top US institutions captures the occasional talent with english proficiency and desire / resources to go abroad. But PRC best have been largely staying in PRC last decade. TBH most Chinese students in west now are those who couldnt hack PRC gaokao/teritary selection system but have rich enough parents to send them abroad. They're B tier talent. Still adequate to work in western labs but you simply don't hear much about PRC students in west who tested top of their districts anymore like in 00s. They're no sending their best and haven't been for while. But generally their ok is good enough. Medium term expect even less PRC students, partly due to geopoltics but also PRC likely phasing out mandetory English as core subject which will make brain draining next gen more difficult. There's always India who seem systemically incapable of preventing brain drain.replyUniverseHacker 1root | I’ll take what you are saying at face value, but point out that academic career pipelines are slow- it’s often about 15 years to go from college freshman to starting out as a “young” PI in the USA.

I've known super bright and talented people who gone off to wall street or FAANG for big $, but I've also known equally strong people who turned it down for low 6 figures doing the research they wanted to.In both cases some are very happy with their choice, others not so much.replyfallingknife 1root | I know a super smart PhD who is now a SWE and he would have been ok with the pay, but not the general BS of academia. So even if money isn't the primary motivator, it's still an issue.replyska 1root | Isn't that sort of what I said? For some people the trade off is worth it, some it isn't. Academia BS vs corporate BS is just one of the aspects.replyketzo 1root | I suppose the researchers at Lawrence National Lab in Berkeley, whose analysis and pre-print replication effort is cited in the linked article, are working with, what, quarter-brains?replypengaru 1root | Pessimal, clearly those are the full, wrinkly brains.replythrow10920 root | This is incredible hyperbole, completely unprovable, and almost certainly untrue.replybugglebeetle 1root | To be fair, China also has an extensive state surveillance apparatus. They just have their military and security agencies run it out in the open at much lower cost. The obfuscation in the US is much more expensive to maintain, but necessary for the illusory veneer of privacy and “freedom.”replyironborn123 1root | I may be wrong, but it seems..US labs dont find replication work exciting enough. If the effect is genuine, good, if not, life goes on.Chinese labs are looking to build credibility, so they will benefit by publicly resolving this.replypharrington 1root | In addition to what the other commenters said, I'm imagining most of the replication attempts in the USA are happening in chemical corporations. Compared to academic labs, the corps have much easier access to highly regulated materials and FAR stricter communication protocols.replyjoefigura 1root | I mean it's been like 3 weekdays since the preprint was widely noticed. Labs in the U.S. are working on it and will publish. I don't think the difference between publishing a replication in 3 days or 2 weeks is meaningful to make inferences about the two countriesreplydeclan_roberts 1root | One limitation here is the required materials, which are likely much easier to get in China. At least one of the materials is a controlled substance by the DEA in the USA.replyThisIsMyAltFace 1root | It turns out outsourcing all of your manufacturing capability to another country has higher order consequences.replyswader999 1root | It's hard to get red phosphorous in USA.replyChatGTP root | Because China is a new global super power on many fronts including science, engineering and manufacturing ?reply0xDEF 1root | Because there has literally only been 2-3 weekdays since the LK-99 revelation.Do you expect American and European scientists to work during weekends?replyEduard 1root | I expect plenty of scientists to be excited enough to replicate a potential breakthrough in their labs on a weekend, just as half of HN enjoys experimenting with the latest LLMs over the weekend for fun and curiosity.replyfloxy 1root | The original paper dropped July 22nd:https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037replytypon 1root | You will hear many explanations, but the real one is that the US leadership in hard science is fading. We are too cerebral and cyber - Asia has picked up the mantle now.replyfluidcruft 1root | With China's research environment things happen really fast--you just never know what you're going to get. Sometimes you get superconductors and sometimes you get COVID.replyRandallBrown 1Can someone explain how this video shows superconductivity?replymrtksn 1root | [not an expert but...]It shows strong diamagnetism(being repelled by both of the poles of a magnet), which is a property of superconductors. Not necessarily a superconductor though, that’s still to be established but at least it shows that the inventors are up to something and it’s not complete fabrication.replyPalpatineli root | That’s a stretch. Dias’ material has real color change under high pressure which is an expected property of superconductors but nobody would argue his paper was not complete fabricationreplybilsbie 1root | Why don’t they try heating it and seeing if the effect goes away? You could even try a welding torch or something.replySimbaOnSteroids 1root | Not only is it a purported to be a room temperature super conductor, it's a relatively high temperature superconductor, not guarantee the effect goes away if you put it under a torch.replygeon 1root | I think the critical temperature was 400 K (127 °C).replysfink 1root | The original preprint said at least 400K. They didn't find an upper limit. And for some reason, they don't seem to have the standard impulse of \"hey, our potentially revolutionary material that we've been working on for 20 years seems to actually be working. Let's check what happens when we set it on fire!\"replydfox 1root | The updated preprint gives Tc of 104.8 degC. I am not a material scientist and do not know much about superconductors, but cursory glance on some of the charts in the paper suggests that the real Tc of sample they measured is somewhat lower that that, but still well above room temperature.replyproto_lambda 1root | As far as I can tell, 127°C is just the highest temperature it was tested at. The critical temperature may be higher.replynorturnn 1root | There are better, less destructive ways to test the transition temperature. Apparently LK-99 is hard to make in bulk, so they probably don't want to torch their sample.replydylan604 1root | or just stick it outside in a heat dome? don't you have one near you?replylost_tourist 1root | lol or a temperature chamber that the vast majority of labs have? heck I made a toaster oven that will go anywhere from 100F to 400F with an arduino and a $3 toaster oven from the junk store.replyRyEgswuCsn 1root | I am no expert on this topic, but I feel this is similar to how ferrofluid forms \"spikes\" when placed near a magnet. Are they related?replymrtksn 1root | I'm not an expert too but AFAIK ferrofluids are actually attracted by magnets. The spikes are probably as a result of having strong and weak locations of magnetic field and the the liquid rushing into those.But yes, Maybe I'm interpreting the video wrongly. Yet, to me it looks like the bulky part of the sample is being repelled by both poles of the magnet as it stands upright with the pointy end at the bottom each time. IMHO if this was due to attraction, the pointy end would be at the top.replyNmi2osv7 1root | No. The spikes are pulled toward the magnet (ferromagnetism) whereas superconductivity is repelled by the magnet (diamagnetism.)replydeclan_roberts 1root | There's all kinds of cool examples of this using liquid nitrogen to make a superconductor exhibit the Meissner effect.The material in question will have these effects at room temperature and pressure.https://youtu.be/HRLvVkkq5GE?t=53reply7moritz7 1root | It shows the magnetic effects associated with superconductors, which are omnidirectional from my understanding, in contrast to a 'regular magnet'replymodzu i dont suppose this is pyrolytic carbonreplyPalpatineli root | Doesn’t have to be. One of the ingredients has diamagnetism alreadyreplyverytrivial 1Hang on, wouldn't a sliver of any magnetic material behave like this within a moving magnetic field? This replication is a fail, yes?replymarshray 1root | Neither lead nor copper are what we would normally consider a \"magnetic material\" like iron.That it interacts strongly with a magnetic field shows that a big change in the material, consistent with superconductivity, has occurred.Quantum level effects are newly appearing in the macroscopic world, and that's always interesting.replyMelatonic 1root | Could this not also have a big use case outside of superconductivity? Decellerators or accelerators for maglev trains or similar?replymarshray root | Oh, definintely!Most materials are diamagnetic, but only very weakly so.I think that a new room-temperature material that was so strongly diamagnetic that it could lift the weight of its own volume in lead probably would bring some interesting new applications.replycrooked-v root | For example, anything with a bearing in it used in an application where it's safe to have a strong permanent magnet.replydrexlspivey 1root | Both polarities repel the material, a normal magnetic material would attract the second timereplysoligern 1root | No, it’s repelled by both poles.replyjeron 1root | From the paper about the replication, they cast strong doubts on the original paper and consider it a failreplynomel 1root | A magnetic material would orient itself to the magnet, and then move towards the magnet, not get \"stuck\" in its fields.replynomel root | Is this somehow incorrect?Getting \"stuck\" in a magnetic field is called \"Flux pinning\", which is what we're seeing here, from what I understand: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_pinningMagnetic material can't do this. They're attracted. As some of the videos have shown, with large magnets placed next to the samples, they are not attracted.replydelfinom 1Can't tell if it's a troll by having a video clip of a video clipreplysvnt 1root | You mean the fact that someone is recording their screen with the microscope video feed at the same time as the magnet in the hand they are placing underneath the scope? It looks like a pretty bog-standard lab video to me.In addition to being the fastest way that doesn’t require any video editing, I can’t really think of a way to do it that would be more likely to be real.replyGlant 1root | At the bottom of the video is a progress bar, which presumably means they screen recorded a clip instead of uploading the original. I think that's what the parent comment is referring to.replynemof 1root | here's the original video, i assume the twitter user didn't know how to download or deeplink to it so they screen recorded it.https://vdn3.vzuu.com/HD/7d42236a-3065-11ee-a787-7e9db7aa394...replybagels 1root | Access deniedreplyRivieraKid China is very good at replicating.reply 372 more comments...",

The alliance seeks to standardize the 3D ecosystem by advancing the capabilities of Open Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD). By promoting greater interoperability of 3D tools and data, the alliance will enable developers and content creators to describe, compose, and simulate large-scale 3D projects and build an ever-widening range of 3D-enabled products and services. Created by Pixar Animation Studios, OpenUSD is a high-performance 3D scene description technology that offers robust interoperability across tools, data, and workflows. Already known for its ability to collaboratively capture artistic expression and streamline cinematic content production, OpenUSD’s power and flexibility make it an ideal content platform to embrace the needs of new industries and applications. The alliance will develop written specifications detailing the features of OpenUSD. This will enable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications. The Linux Foundation’s JDF was chosen to house the project, as it will enable open, efficient, and effective development of OpenUSD specifications, while providing a path to recognition through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). AOUSD will also provide the primary forum for the collaborative definition of enhancements to the technology by the greater industry. The alliance invites a broad range of companies and organizations to join and participate in shaping the future of OpenUSD. “Universal Scene Description was invented at Pixar and is the technological foundation of our state-of-the-art animation pipeline,” said Steve May, Chief Technology Officer at Pixar and Chairperson of AOUSD. “OpenUSD is based on years of research and application in Pixar filmmaking. We open-sourced the project in 2016, and the influence of OpenUSD now expands beyond film, visual effects, and animation and into other industries that increasingly rely on 3D data for media interchange. With the announcement of AOUSD, we signal the exciting next step: the continued evolution of OpenUSD as a technology and its position as an international standard.” “At Adobe, we believe in providing artists a set of flexible and powerful solutions running on a variety of devices,” said Guido Quaroni, Senior Director of Engineering, 3D&I at Adobe. “Leveraging a common 3D data representation during the creative process multiplies the value brought by each package and device. OpenUSD was created to be one of these ‘multipliers’ and we are excited to see a diverse group of companies joining together to support this innovative and open technology.” “OpenUSD will help accelerate the next generation of AR experiences, from artistic creation to content delivery, and produce an ever-widening array of spatial computing applications,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Vision Products Group. “Apple has been an active contributor to the development of USD, and it is an essential technology for the groundbreaking visionOS platform, as well as the new Reality Composer Pro developer tool. We look forward to fostering its growth into a broadly adopted standard.” “Whether you’re building CG worlds or digital twins or looking ahead to the 3D web, content creators need a cohesive way to collaborate and share data across tools, services, and platforms,” said Gordon Bradley, Fellow, Media & Entertainment, Autodesk. “Autodesk is excited to support the Alliance for OpenUSD as it drives 3D interoperability for visual effects, animation, and beyond, and supports our vision to help customers design and make a better world.”   “OpenUSD gives 3D developers, artists, and designers the complete foundation to tackle large-scale industrial, digital content creation, and simulation workloads with broad multi-app interoperability,” said Guy Martin, Director of Open Source and Standards at NVIDIA. “This alliance is a unique opportunity to accelerate OpenUSD collaboration globally by building formal standards across industries and initiatives to realize 3D worlds and industrial digitalization.” AOUSD steering committee members will be speaking at both the Academy Software Foundation’s Open Source Days on Aug. 6 and at the SIGGRAPH conference at the Autodesk Vision Series on Aug. 8 at 1 p.m. PT in Room 404A.

But also consider: \"Please don't complain about tangential annoyances—e.g. [...] name collisions [...]. They're too common to be interesting.\" - https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.htmlMAGZine 1This is a big deal. I used to work at Autodesk, trying to build software that made 3D blueprints available to everyone, everywhere. Rendering things on mobile is hard, in part because you need to writer bespoke renderers, and in part because the data formats for the assets are not aligned.Pixar developed USD, and it should really help to standardize 3D tech. In particular, I hope that USD can help make it easier to build high-performance rendering tech for a variety of applications that might not receive so much attention from the 3D graphics people (this is one thing video games do quite well, from a CS approach!)Having some big names behind the standard should help, but of course, the proof will be in the pudding as to how meaningful their contributions are, and how much their involvement pushes the adoption of the standard.replyknolan 37 I’ve been happy with what modelviewer.dev offers me; someone with very little experience with 3D on the web. It’s basically a wrapper for three.js to view glTF files quickly and easily. It lets me load very small files and interact with them with JavaScript.It’s perfect for my needs as an educator and I know just enough to be able to show other educators how to create and deploy their own learning materials.replydoctorpangloss > Rendering things on mobile is hardI don't know. You can stream Unity to mobile with the service I've authored (https://appmana.com/watch/theheretic for an example).replyesperent root | Looks nice. However the issue with all 3d streaming I've ever tried is latency. It's great if you're near the server. Terrible if you're far away.It's hard so say what the input latency is for the head demo you shared. I guess about 100ms, which is totally fine for a mostly static scene with simple orbit controls.However I also tried out the Lebron James vs Father Time game. Input latency is over 1 second so it's not playable. Any time I touch the screen it freezes for a second then jumps to the new location.replydoctorpangloss root | You might like this one more - https://appmana.com/watch/virtualtestdrive - because it's just better :)While of course I want latency to be as low as possible, the difference between 100ms and 500ms of latency doesn't register in the engagement metrics for these experiences. For millions of laypeople, it doesn't seem to matter that much. However, going from 670ms of time to first image (this service) and 2.5s (worst case) increases bounce rates by as much as 5 percentage points. PureWeb, which typically takes 35s to load, isn't suitable for any mass audience at all.So imagine downloading a USDZ file for some AR thing. It's real, it's something people try to do. But the bounce rates on those experiences are insane, I don't know why Niantic funds them, there isn't anything you can do about it. There isn't a future for \"it takes a while to load\" on phones. That's the real constraint.replyweird-eye-issue root | Couldn't bother waiting for this to load unfortunatelyreplyandersa root | Cool, who is going to pay for it? This isn't rendering things on mobile.replyweird-eye-issue root | Yikes the performance is terrible. You are not proving the point that you think you arereplyandsoitis root | > with the service I've authoredYou created Appmana?reply2OEH8eoCRo0 1Can I open an OpenUSD file in a text editor and read it?replyomershapira 1root | OpenUSD has a plaintext encoding mode, which by convention gets saved as .usda. The standard OpenUSD SDK contains two command line utilities `usdcat` and `usdedit` to do plaintext editing, but most programs using the SDK have better editing functionality by directly using the C/Python SDK.replywilg 1root | Here is an example file for the curious: https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/blob/releas...replypixelesque 1root | The ASCII (plain-text, .usda file extension version) absolutely.For large scenes/models, the normal .usd binary/compressed version is often used for efficiency reasons (and proper round-tripping of float values for xforms, etc), but you can convert between the two with the 'usdcat' util and the python/c++ apis for debugging.replyderefr root | > proper round-tripping of float valuesWhy do so many (all?) textual data serialization formats represent floats in base-10 scientific notation, anyway?If we wanted floats that are 1. human-editable but 2. bijective with IEEE754, wouldn't floating-point hexadecimal (and \"e\" notation representing a base-2 exponent) be a better idea?replyandyferris root | > human-editableI mean, depends on the human. Most don't know hexadecimal, but know what 3.14 means.The real issue is why do so many float parsers and printers fail to do exact round tripping? Designing a good algorithm for this was a bit difficult, but these days this is a solved problem.replyjohnnyanmac 28 root | If I had to take a slightly snide guess: because these are low level tools, so there's a 90% chance that these parsers/prints are written in C, or ultimately depend on C implementations. As any C programmer would know, C loves to throw \"undefined behavior\" at any problem it doesn't bother to document. Which is a lot.That combined with almost zero package management for retrieving things that were solved decades ago means we keep coming into this issue, partially because of the mindset of C programmers.replypixelesque root | Some do (i.e. Nuke compositor .nk files in the VFX industry, which stores some float values as hex)...but then you loose the human readability / \"understand-ability at a glance\" advantage, so it sort of depends what the use-case is...replyderefr root | The best of both worlds, at least in my opinion, would be to write a float as a polynomial in two parts (where either part alone is still a float): an integer part with an optional scientific-notation exponent; and a fractional part, where the fraction's denominator is always a power of two.So 5e3 is a float; 3/8 is a float; and 5e3+3/8 is a float. Each cleanly and exactly representing particular IEEE754 values, while also being readable as a base-10 polynomials.Maybe fractions of arithmetically-specified powers of two could also be allowed, for really big denominators. 3/2**26, for example.replypixelesque root | That's not particularly user-friendly though: at least for CG/VFX software (where USD came from and is designed for), non-technical (at least in terms of understanding IEEE floats) people like artists often want to look at the values to verify stuff for 'debugging' (i.e. is the software tool I'm using actually exporting the correct values I selected in the UI params panel).Having to do any form of interpretation (even scientific notation is not ideal in some cases), is not great for many users.replyDaub root | I love that a Nuke file can (usually) be passed around using no more than copy/pasted text.replyGoofballJones root | Yeah, sounds kind of like the old Renderman RIB files.

The question of how and at what layers AI could interact with 3D art and still give the final aesthetic decision to humans with a true artistic eye left a big gap in willingness to use AI for 3D projects.If, essentially, they are speaking the same language as humans, this curation becomes trivial and the cost of incorporating AI becomes purely artistic in nature rather than a technical or organizational cost. There will be no downside for a 3D artist to tell the servers \"render this scene, but generate a few different versions if you finish before I get back to work tomorrow\" in the worst scenario it is electricity used, in the average scenario it can inspire new ideas, and in the ideal scenario it creates something usable.replyflohofwoe > but I think the biggest beneficiaries will be AI'sIt's just another 3D file format, calm down ;)There have been quite a few \"standard\" 3D file formats in the last 30 years (COLLADA, FBX, glTF, to name a few of the more popular ones, check here for a more complete list: https://github.com/assimp/assimp/tree/master/code/AssetLib), USD isn't anything special except that Apple is involved (which means you probably shouldn't put too much hope into the \"Open\" prefix, or at least expect that Apple jumps ship as soon as the first cracks start to show in the \"alliance\").replyrallyforthesun 1nvidia uses usd as standardfileformat in its omniverse 3d suite. They are starting to integrate AI into it, for example to convert an image into a 3d scene.replyrcarr 1This was my immediate thought. I reckon this will be one of the early steps in getting to automated movies.replydanwills I find it slightly odd that SideFX aren't part of this. They have worked very closely with Pixar on integrating USD into Houdini in a new subsystem/type of network called 'Solaris' / Lops. It is a very deep and powerful integration too: You can edit USD data using the Python Lop (pxr.Usd API) or even with Vex/Vops (a SIMD-focused language that can be 'written' using 'Vop' nodes that compiles to bytecode and runs (fast) on LLVM.) Makes sense considering how much Houdini gets used to create assets (including at Pixar and for many AAA games as well.) Hopefully the alliance don't make things harder for Solaris! (Autodesk is a direct competitor because of Maya).replylvncelot Solaris (in Houdini 18 I think?) was my introduction to USD and a pretty deep rabbit hole for a few weeks.Although its functionality is way beyond a solo hobbyist's needs, the whole time I was thinking about how cool it is to have a standardized format, and how much it must benefit teams working together on a project.replydanwills Ah, I see SideFX are there as a \"General Member\"! Cool!replyagumonkey root | pretty cool indeedlong live sidefxreplydanwills root | I couldn't agree more, and that's from much experience working in VFX on tools/code and contacting SideFX support a lot (mostly by email) It's just been some astoundingly good support!

They're more of an \"downstream user\".It's similar to SideFX and Houdini, which is an extremely common way to author USD scenes. SideFX isn't a member either, just a downstream user.replydagmx root | SideFX are a member. They’re listed on the main site under General Members.replyepolanski 1I see lots of off topic comments, but I'd like to ask as someone who played with fbx and similar formats supported by Autodesk and large parts of the gaming/CG industry what does OpenUSD provides exactly over different formats.I feel like there's never been a 3D counterpart to standards like Midi for audio.replyjsheard 1For one the reference implementation of USD is open source, unlike FBX where you have to depend on Autodesks binary blobs and are at the mercy of whatever jankiness comes with them. Such as the fact that the FBX SDK still isn't thread safe in TYOOL 2023 so you have to take a global lock whenever you touch it.Even Autodesk is backing USD so presumably even they have given up on the long term prospects of FBX.replyOmarShehata 1root | What about glTF?replyjms55 1root | glTF is actually pretty good. It just's fairly minimal and lacks support for an entire scene description, lacking important features such as LODs.Coincidentally, I help develop the Bevy game engine, and I was just talking to people about working on a bevy_usd library. From what they told me, USD is extremely complicated, and the \"spec\" is basically just the C++ source code. I was warned not to bother. Imo it would be better if glTF just got more support and extensions.replykevthecoder 8 root | Yeah, working with OpenUSD in Rust is difficult. There's been a bit of work on Rust bindings but it's not ready at the moment (https://github.com/vfx-rs/usd-bind). I believe you need the c++ code base locally for the bindings, which adds an extra barrier for development.A full Rust port of OpenUSD would be very ambitious. It's quite complicated (e.g. the OpenUSD composition rules) and depends on other vfx c++ libraries.I've been experimenting with implementating a subset of OpenUSD in Rust, but there's lots of challenges given the original codebase. E.g. the c++ code uses lots of base classes, downcasting and there's no lifetime information. It's possible to port these across, but gets ugly in the details (e.g. trying to avoid non-static downcasting in Rust). It would take a lot of effort to do a total idiomatic rewrite given the size of the codebase and how interconnected the pieces are in OpenUSD. I still think it's worth pursuing though, OpenUSD is great.replykettlecorn root | This is the dark secret to USD: pretty much everyone is relying on the same massive C++ project!Projects that want leaner dependencies, like everything on the web, don’t yet have a good way to work with USD.replyvvanders root | That gives me serious collada vibes. I've been out of the space for ~6 years but I recall that collada was the thing that was supposed to solve all of this, looks like it didn't really take off.replydagmx root | Colada was really under specified and support was super fractured. It never really gained traction as a result outside of very specific pipelinesreplypixelesque 1root | glTF is really single-asset only: that's not what USD is - USD is designed for entire scenes with scene graph hierarchy, and layers of overrides / additions (it's essentially a mini-evaluation engine internally). It's very powerful, but also quite complicated, and not just a file format.USD started in the very complicated CG/VFX world where this type of complexity and flexibility is needed, however, Apple (and others) have been pushing it into other realms (VR, mobile, .usdz).replyjsheard 1root | They serve different roles, glTF is intended to be an asset delivery format that aligns with how GPUs work so it can be loaded onto one with fairly minimal overhead. USD is intended to be an interchange format for moving assets between editors and renderers. They're kind of analogous to JPG/PNG and PSD respectively, if PSD were an open standard.What Apple is doing with USD might have been better served by glTF, but glTF is a Khronos standard and Apple refuses to work with them for unspecified legal reasons.replyGeekyBear root | > glTF is a Khronos standard and Apple refuses to work with themGiven that Apple created OpenCL and handed it over to Khronos, this seems a bit off.> OpenCL was initially developed by Apple Inc., which holds trademark rights, and refined into an initial proposal in collaboration with technical teams at AMD, IBM, Qualcomm, Intel, and Nvidia. Apple submitted this initial proposal to the Khronos Group.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL#HistoryApple just has a long history of working with Pixar. I think they've been using Pixar's USD as the basis for their AR asset file format since 2018.https://www.techrepublic.com/article/apples-usdz-ar-file-for...replyjsheard root | They used to work with Khronos but things have developed since 2008 - Apple has completely abandoned OpenCL and OpenGL, won't support Vulkan alongside Metal, and during the development of WebGPU one of their representatives let slip that there's a legal dispute blocking any further interaction between Apple and Khronos.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6ns6I3zs-2JL_dT9hOkX_25...> Apple is not comfortable working under Khronos IP framework, because of dispute between Apple Legal & Khronos which is private. Can’t talk about the substance of this dispute. Can’t make any statement for Apple to agree to Khronos IP framework.Since the details of the dispute haven't come out it's unclear if it has been resolved yet, but regardless they don't seem to be on good terms.replyGeekyBear root | Interesting. Thanks!replyslimsag root | glTF is not a very optimal runtime format, and IIRC it even started out originally with the statement that it was 'purely for interchanging models between programs' and that engines would/should still use their own format (hence the Transfer Format in the glTF name.)Even GLB, the binary glTF format, is very sub-optimal for runtime. It even has chunks of JSON embedded in it.replyjsheard root | glTF wouldn't be my first choice for a runtime format but it's hard to see the intent behind it as anything but a runtime format, there's a very distinct mapping from glTF concepts to OpenGL concepts. The first version didn't even have a standard material definition, the asset just had an inlined GLSL shader to render it with. They even use the same enum values so that you can plug the values in the glTF file directly into an OpenGL call if you want to.Marrying the format so closely to OpenGL is looking pretty dated now of course, with OpenGL/WebGL dead and buried by Vulkan/WebGPU. You can render glTF with Vulkan/WebGPU but the flexibility of the format and the newer APIs rigid pipeline layouts are at odds with each other - ideally you want the data to follow a consistent, rigid layout.replypjmlp root | > OpenGL/WebGL dead and buried by Vulkan/WebGPU.If only.Vulkan requires everyone to be a driver writer before they can even think about drawing a triangle, while at the same time already beating OpenGL with spaghetti extensions at the rate it is getting new ones every month.And it is only a GNU/Linux and Android thing anyway, not the main API on PlayStation, XBox, Apple, Windows and Switch.WebGL took a decade to be fully adopted, WebGPU has at least another decade ahead of it until it becomes fully widespread, and even then it will be targeting 2015 hardware capabilities.replyerichocean 1> what does OpenUSD provides exactly over different formatsUSD is to scene authoring what FBX is to 3D object authoring (though it also can do 3D object authoring).USD adds complex shading, lighting and cameras, state-of-the-art multi-level instancing workflows, and most importantly, a very flexible way of referencing/layering assets and performing per-scene or per-shot overrides, plus tools (payloads) that enable extremely large scenes to be opened and authored in minutes instead of hours.It really is pretty groundbreaking and has a ton of momentum.The other hugely helpful component is USD has a very high-performance rendering architecture written in C++ called \"Hydra\" that allows for both interactive and non-interactive rendering backends to be developed and switched between at runtime. I can't think of a single commercial renderer that either hasn't already built a Hydra delegate, or isn't planning to.replyKeyframe root | Pretty much a next-gen RIB. FBX itself was always weird child ever since Kaydara days (untill bought by Autodesk).replynottorp 38 Currency hijack aside, will this be usable without paying royalties? Adobe and Autodesk are involved...replyavmich 1Seen Autodesk here, which might - or might not - mean that the standard is also applicable for 3D engineering artifacts. However I see no explicit mention of this in the article by the link. Can this standard be well used for, say, designing a model for a 3D printer?replyjahewson For professional CAD/CAM use cases? No. Those do not use meshes but more sophisticated and computationally expensive 3D modelling techniques. For hobby use? Sure. Most of that stuff uses meshes already.Edit: it’s actually not just meshes that are supported. But the usual CAD/CAM surfaces are still not supported.replygibsonf1 root | With a brief look at the example, it looks like they represent form with formulas instead of meshes, enabling fabrication from the form, for example. This is one of the reasons BIM software like Revit is so unhelpful for fabrication as they don't use formulas to represent the form so you can't get high enough accuracy.replyjahewson root | Not sure what example you are referring to. I see meshes and some built-in geometries.On closer inspection they do support subdivision surfaces! Just not the usual NURBs. So you could probably use this for professional modelling it just won’t be compatible with the industry standard software.replyfsloth Autodesk is huge in ’visual’ pipelines that are not directly related to engineering. Maya etc.This is very litle about manufacturing, except you can of course always convert a model to 3D mesh for visualization etc. That is quite common, and in that workflow usd is as good as any other ’mesh plus material’ format.The output of engineering design software usually is: 1) Shop drawings for building the whole thing or sub-assembly 2) CNC machine compatible presentation 3) 3D meshes for visualization 4) conversion to some other engineering formatYou can always more or less export a 3D mesh, wich can then be 3D printed. So - printing, yes. But adds nothing to any other visua format in that workflow (stl,obj,…).replycobbal 1I suspect, but have no evidence, that it's the Maya side of AutoDeskreplybsimpson root | When Pixar launched USD, the release included a Maya plugin. That's a totally reasonable assumption.replyLightFog 1root | I doubt it - for 3D CAD there are STEP/IGES etc. Most of the 3D printing issues are from triangulation/voxelization of analytical surfaces rather than interchange format.replydanwills I don't think it's gonna help with the design side of things but USD does include a volume primitive type in its 'UsdVol' section:https://openusd.org/release/api/usd_vol_page_front.htmlSo it sounds like it could be possible to use USD to convey data to a 3D printer eventually once the printers have loaders for the new format.replypbreit I thought this was going to be some sort of US Dollar-based stable coin.

    "originBody": "back I'm betting on HTML 8/1/2023AI Use Disclaimer: I wrote this post and then GPT-4 fixed my grammer and spellingWith the advent of large language model-based artificial intelligence, semantic HTML is more important now than ever. At its core, the internet is used to transmit data that helps humans interact with the world as they perceive it. The freedom that HTML/CSS/JS provide is a double-edged sword because access to data has become limited. Instead of open and accessible data formats and APIs, we’re kept within the walled gardens of major technology companies that operate mass social media sites. Because of this, interoperability between these platforms is effectively impossible, further complicated by these companies’ hesitance to allow easy data porting. After all, that’s their entire product, and without it, they can’t make money. The recent instability of our social media sites has renewed interest in decentralized platforms like the “fediverse”. Both Meta’s Threads and Jack Dorsey’s (Twitter founder) Bluesky claim interoperability with the larger fediverse. This is great!But guess what? The general population doesn’t care!What I mean is that people are not typically motivated to adopt new social media platforms for reasons that may not be entirely clear. I’m not condemning these efforts - I believe there’s a future there, and I’m watching as the development progresses. However, I believe we’re already sitting on a tried and tested solution: HTML.Historically, heavy use of CSS was needed to prevent HTML content from looking terrible when rendered in a browser. Luckily, it’s not 1997 anymore! There are many new HTML elements that I wasn’t aware of until recently. I believe we now have virtually a complete set of all UI elements needed to build any modern web application. I don’t foresee corporate designers giving up their fancy JavaScript date picker that, in a shock to nobody actually breaks the entire site on mobile, anytime soon. But we’re on the fringe, and we can do whatever we want. In fact, recently I’ve become acutely aware of reader mode. All time spent on styling will be obliterated by reader mode, and that’s a great thing!Moreover, proper tagging is extremely descriptive in a machine-readable format. This is likely a more compelling reason for adopting modern HTML than saving design time. The shift from primary data interfaces to secondary interfaces is already underway. RSS refuses to die. ChatGPT-like interfaces are likely the future of human data access. We’re going back to the beginning. Advertisers may be scared, but I’m not! Let’s start the revolution and set the world on fire with modern HTML.Below are a few examples of UI elements I found novel or useful. No style has been applied to these beyond the browser’s built-in style. Note that because of this, these examples may look vastly different (or be completely unsupported) in various browsers. It’s well worth your time browsing the full list on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element: The Abbreviation elementWrap any abbreviation in this! You can apply a style to highlight them. Mostly useful for machine reading.: The HTML Data List elementIs that a typeahead I see? 🧐 Doesn’t seem to have built in validation, but the UI is there at least. Note that Safari requires option tags to be closed, or it just gives up. 😮‍💨Choose a King Gizzard album: : The Details disclosure elementA little dropdown thing for disclosoures and stuff. Can by styled quite aggressively.PRIVACY DISCLOSURE : The Dialog elementSay the magic word and make me disappear!NoThis isn’t exactly a modal, but it is a built-in element that can be opened and closed with buttons, forms, attributes, and JavaScript. If you’re building a modal, you should use this as a base. Apparently, it renders on top of the next element. vs. Know the difference!: The Inline Frame elementJust kidding.: The Input (Form Input) elementPlease, please, please, please, please label and use inputs appropriately! This is essential for mobile users as the OS will open variations of the keyboard depending on context. I have an old post on that. There is a plethora of time inputs. No more datepickers please! Check out these inputs:color:range:datetime-local: : The Mark Text elementPretty much you can highlight text. By default Safari shows a yellow highlight. I like it!: The HTML Meter elementNow what exactly is this cute little guy for? Safari will show it as red/yellow/green depending on parameters that can be set. You can even get fancy and set the “optimum” value. Could be very useful. Let’s get a JS demo going to make a music visualizer at 60fps! : The Progress Indicator elementHere’s a native HTML progress bar! If that’s not progress, I don’t know what is. Can be given a fixed value or indeterminate. On Safari, it’s blue when the window is active and grey when it’s not. By default it will follow the system’s accent color, or can be set with the accent-color CSS property. Discuss on Hacker News",

    "commentBody": "I'm betting on HTML (catskull.net)470 points by catskull 189 commentsp-e-w HTML is the solution to walled-garden lock-in? What? Those walled gardens already use HTML, including some of the semantic elements mentioned (plus ARIA semantic attributes, which are much more sophisticated).> ChatGPT-like interfaces are likely the future of human data access.And the whole point of artificial intelligence systems is that they don't require specialized \"machine-readable\" annotations in order to process input. ChatGPT (and its future offspring) can navigate regular websites the same way humans do. They don't need us to hold their hand. They know when a sequence of paragraphs constitutes a \"list\", without it having to be explicitly marked as such, etc.What the author appears to be describing is simply an API mediated through HTML semantic elements. But if you have an API, you don't need a Large Language Model for automatic data access – a good old Python script using Beautiful Soup will do just fine. And it has the added benefit that it runs entirely locally.replybob1029 This seems reductive to me.There's \"HTML\" and then there's the kind of website where the final DOM isn't known until the user has already been attempting to read it for 10 seconds. There is a substantial difference in the % of browser capabilities that need to be exercised between the extremes of use.Complexity of implementation is what ultimately separates the good from the bad. Any tool can be operated skillfully or poorly. An apprentice with a circular saw and a fully charged battery can do a hell of a lot of damage. A master may elect to use no tool at all and simply bang on the side of the thing (I.e. push back on the business).The latest websites I have built are some of my most compatible ever. I don't use web sockets anymore. I don't depend on JavaScript to have piecemeal conversation with the server. You can actually use ~80% of the product with JavaScript entirely disabled. How are the engineering choices demonstrated here not exactly the solution for walled garden lock-in?replyfeitingen root | Lots of websites already present a machine friendly site to google-bot and some other spiders.I don't see why they can't offer the same to other bots and only serve the Javascript-heavy pages to humans.replyMrDresden root | The point is that a lot can be done without the need for Javascript. Also in pages served to humans.replywruza ChatGPT (and its future offspring) can navigate regular websites the same way humans doIt seems to be at least a not-yet-true claim, but let’s ignore that for now. It’s interesting if LLMs actually could do this. As I understand it, LLMs are trained on texts and source code among other things. But lacking… let’s name it a reasoning apparatus, can they really look at a DOM tree and tell what it is/does? It’s not a text, and barely can be a well-structured source code that was ever discussed (it’s a result of either bundling or componentization). This is almost on par with “LLMs will look at any .exe and be able to integrate with it immediately”.replydelusional root | > “LLMs will look at any .exe and be able to integrate with it immediately”.The LLM will look at any .exe and determine if it halts.replychromoblob 28 root | .exe's (for the usual architectures) run on finite-state machines, not Turing machines. So, indeed, that is possible.If the .exe connects to a service that runs on something more powerful than finite-state machine, though, I don't know.replykaba0 18 root | That’s still a stupid pedantry, and is even false.A Turing machine only makes use of at most n cells of its tape after n steps - so running it for a finite number of steps is possible even in finite memory. Especially that modern computers can do arbitrary side effects, having access to the whole universe as tape, which is still finite, but so is time.There is no way to differentiate between a magical Turing machine with infinite tape and a “fake” one that has n-sized memory under any program that takes n steps, so for all practical purposes they are identical.replychromoblob 9 root | Why are they identical? A program may use more steps than memory.replyKronisLV root | > The LLM will look at any .exe and determine if it halts.At that point you'd need an AGI that can figure out something we can't.Edit: but yeah, sarcasm. Nowadays I can't even tell sometimes.replykaba0 root | I am 100% sure that parent poster was being sarcastic at the hype around LLMs and how many think they can solve everything, even if said thing is impossible to do, e.g. the halting problem.Do note that the halting problem is fundamentally true, no AGI will realize some new way around, unless are mathematics are flawed to the core.replymythhabit 13 root | There is some nuances here. While the general halting problem for a general Turing machine is undecidable, and with a fairly easy to understand proof as well, the computers we run today are not a general Turing machine. They are of a weaker class called Linear Bounded Automatons and for the programs they can run, the halting problem is fact decidable, on a theoretical level due to their finite nature.So we will probably never practically solve the halting for LBAs due to the fact, the quest for this AGI that should be able to solve this, is not just day dreaming, it's rooted in the theory.replyreichstein root | I think KronisLV's point, presented ironically, is that not even an AI superior to human reasoning, which can figure out things we cannot, can decide the undecidable.Being undecidable is a hard limit, not something that requires better algorithms. Another phrasing of it could be: No finite program can decide it. (And what even is an infinite program? Not something we can run on any current computer.)If an AI is itself a finite-sized program, something we run on computers, it cannot possibly solve the halting problem.And _any_ non-trivial property of programs is undecidable, so an AI \"integrating with any .exe file\" isn't really meaningful. It's just words.replywruza root | I believe it was a positive sarcasm in gp.replyabwizz root | i suspect this is because they can divide by zeroreplykevinstubbs root | > can they really look at a DOM tree and tell what it is/doesYes, if you encode the DOM as a list of options for ChatGPT to choose from. In fact I developed a proof of concept of this for a client. https://jarvys.ai/ although they seem to have pivoted from automating just the browser to automating all software.replyrezonant root | Well if the DOM is all unstructured divs with no semantic information, can a human even tell what it means without applying the structural styling on the page?A good example would be a misguided approach at making a bunch of labels with values that are aligned. Someone told this poor developer thatis bad, so they figure hey, let's use CSS to lay it out. They make a dictionary of the key/value pairs and iterate over all the keys in the first column into the first div and then output all the values in the second div.div - label 1 - label 2div - value 1 - value 2If there's 100 key/values it's going to be hard for a human to figure out which value is for the 76th item, and LLMs have proven to be very bad at indexing problems like that so I wouldn't expect it to be a better story there.(Not saying this wouldn't work in some cases, just couldn't be a general solution given the crap out there)replywruza root | if you encode the DOM as a list of options for ChatGPT to choose fromNot sure if I understand this, does it mean you have to pre-cook DOM in a specific way? If yes, then isn’t the answer to my question “no”, like “no, it can’t take any site and use it as is”?replykevinstubbs root | You have to give GPT an objective, like \"find an apartment in Florida\" and then say something like \"given the following options, which one would you interact with to get closer to your objective.\"So if you assume that you start on google.com, then your options are like 1.) Input with name \"search\", placeholder \"search anything\", value \"\" 2.) Button with label \"I'm feeling lucky\" 3.) Button with label \"search\"Obviously, doing just one of these doesn't achieve the objective - it just needs to pick which one it thinks has the most \"value\" for completing the objective. If you repeat that enough times, then it can actually do what your overall goal of the session was.I'm just giving a simplistic answer, and if you implemented only what I've written, then it's going to get stuck in a loop more often than not. But that's the gist of how you could encode the DOM into something that GPT can interpret and make decisions/take actions based on.replywruza root | Got it, thanks!reply3cats-in-a-coat 57 root | LLM would find it easier to browse through a browser. Like us. Implying image model linked.replyrezonant I got the sense that the article was advocating for using good semantic machine readable content over HTTP instead of (or at least in addition to) JS-only div soup so that automated agents like the new wave of LLMs can easily pull out the important details without spinning up a headless browser and rendering the page first.I have the same interest but for the purpose of crawling and upstart search engines. If indexing every page required running the page in a headless browser first, the barrier to entry for new search engines is a lot higher.replymmahemoff Valid point. Ironically the main benefit of semantic markup is now an abstraction to help the human developers effect styling and control.replyjraph root | Isn't the main benefit of semantic markup still accessibility?replymmahemoff root | That’s one of the main benefits, but if the machine can make sense of the content, it can still present it however is clearest for the user.replyfauigerzigerk AI in general could \"see\" a website like we see it. But LLMs specialise in text. They will find it much easier to figure out the correct semantic interpretation of tag soup than deriving the same information from the rendered output like we do.Also, the big question is cost. I think semi structured text will forever be far cheaper for an AI to process than a completely unstructured data stream representing visual information.replytheteapot > ChatGPT (and its future offspring) can navigate regular websites the same way humans do. They don't need us to hold their hand.It can?! It does that?replyandai root | ChatGPT had a Browser Plugin (via the Plus subscription) but last I checked it was removed, (possibly because it cannibalized Bing? Or just the reliability issues).replyjack_pp root | In its current form, not as far as I know. Even the OpenAI tutorial on this matter scrapes first and uses only normal text.https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/apps/web...replyabwizz > They know when a sequence of paragraphs constitutes a \"list\", without it having to be explicitly marked as such, etc.that's the thing; they don't know - they guessreplycircuit10 26 root | Humans do the same, it’s usually obvious from the contextreplykennyloginz You don’t need a good old Python script using Beautiful soup, you can use an LLM with the added benefit of not dealing with that cruft.replyselfhoster11 root | An LLM is much slower and requires more resources at runtime than Beautiful Soup (if you are hosting yourself), and could fail to retrieve data. It's a worse solution unless your HTML parser/scraper is broken by website changes.This is only the case for now, however. I expect this to change in favour of LLMs as time goes on and they become easier to deploy and better at their job.replygrumbel 8 I would care more about markup if the browser would actually be able to do anything interesting with it, but for most part markup is a just a default style for an element, the semantic meaning is ignored. Thetag is about the last one I can think of that actually made a difference from the users perspective.There is also a lot of markup for really common tasks still missing, I'd like to see anand something to handle pagination at the browser level (rel=\"next\" has been around for decades, but browser don't care). And more broadly, I'd really like to see much better support for long-form documents in HTML or at the very least native ePub support in the browser.replyklardotsh I had heard of almost none of these HTML elements, and that's such a shame, because they could seriously help put the \"we need JavaScript for every gosh darn thing\" ecosystem to an end (or at least return JS to what it was originally meant to be: a way to add some flair, some interactivity, some whatever, but not necessarily a replacement for all of your markup and a full-DOM manager).I'm starting to think my dream browser might be something like visurf https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/visurf/ but with the underlying Netsurf engine updated to support various modern HTML+CSS, such as these elements. I bet you could have a nearly JS-free smolweb through that browser that:1. is more accessible (in the \"doesn't break screenreaders, system theming, keybinds, etc\" way)2. could be made to use way fewer resources than these heavy JS contraptions these elements can replace3. would still be able to do most things we expect the median web app of today to do (sure, fire up Firefox for WebGL or whatever still, but I could see, say, a Matrix client potentially needing only a smidge of JS (largely for WebSockets and E2EE stuff) over top of very-modern HTML)replyrenegade-otter I just ran into \"datalist\" and my first impression was \"wow, game changer\". The behavior is the same across browsers but the appearance is strictly browser-specific. You can't style it with CSS.Sometimes the list displays the text of the data, sometimes, the text and the \"value\" attribute. So you are not selecting \"Atlanta\" - you are selecting \"234290780 Atlanta\" (the ID and the value).And with the on-click action, you can't just get the ID - you have to get the whole thing and parse the ID out.It just seems... abandoned.replyiamflimflam1 10 root | That's the problem with most of these things, half assed implementations that just tick the box of \"compliant with a standard\".There's a reason why we have all these frameworks built on top of HTML - it's because the browser manufacturers have not done their jobs.replyGigachad In general the issue with these built in components is that you can't theme them. And they stick out like a sore thumb when you get a windows 7 style component in the middle of a modern looking app.They also have basically no extensibility so when you inevitably need to do something half complex, you have to scrap it and start again with JS. So you may as well have just started with JS which just works, gives you full power, works identical on all systems, etc.In the end all these extra components just end up as bloat all browsers have to implement but no one uses.replyklardotsh root | Unfortunately this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree. Half the time with Electron apps I wish I could disable CSS completely and just use my system theme because it sucks less than whatever the designer came up with for that app (the definition of \"sucks less\" falls into many axes that vary per application and context; no point in digressing far into that), so what you described would be a feature, not a bug, to me.(Further, I basically never, ever want an app to theme itself. Ever. If I set a system theme it's because I want the system to look like that. I've gone on tirades here and on other forums for years about finding https://stopthemingmy.app/ and even just the freedom of every electron app to pick its own HIG and UX as absolute heresy, so if nothing else, my opinions are consistent here.)replymixmastamyk root | SKINZ all over againz!replySjeiti root | JS does not 'just work'. This is why a lot of these custom components have bad touch interaction and no accessibility. Take the datepicker; the native mobile version works great, why annoy users with a custom component?replywruza root | why annoy users with a custom componentBecause a system you’re developing may have specialized modes. There’s no “today”, “yesterday” or “last week” or “q3” and other suitable shortcuts in standard date/period peekers. Another method is to use a text field which parses itself into a date or a period. E.g. “2-5” means (and/or expands into) 2023-08-02..2023-08-05. “May” means 2023-05-{01..31}. And so on.My users always appreciated these buttons and modes because they were working in accounting and picking dates from that stupid standard picker was an ordeal. “ / / “ pattern is also annoying because you have to be precise with your cursor.That said, ios picker is great, and it’s unnecessary to replace it. But (1) it’s not the only useful mode of operation, (2) it wasn’t always great on all platforms, and (3) html attributes usually suck at describing what patterns and use cases you want and compatibility among browsers is a minefield. I mean not only dates here, also numbers and ~numeric fields.replySjeiti root | You're absolutely right on the 'why' part, but sadly a lot of custom implementations are annoying in terms of UX and accessibility. My only point here is that building proper custom components is far from easy, it takes a lot of time and effort.replyyyyk root | >Take the [HTML] datepicker* Lets you enter nonexistent dates like 31/2* Can and often does accidentally place the user in American-style MM/DD format where it should be European-style DD/MM (I have a replicable case now on that page example).* No ability to force date style by design. So there's no way to fix the above from the server, or to use ISO-style dates. Only way to reliably prevent MM/DD by default is to fix every client configuration - not very likely even in small companies.* No way to have the datetime dialog open by default.* Poorish but getting better keyboard support (the pagedown-up keys finally work in most browsers, but once you've opened the dialog you can't enter a new date with the keyboard).* Timezones must be handled separately, which is just poor design.(Entire list checked on desktop)replyrobocat 49 root | > the native mobile version [of datepicker] works greatStrong disagree. It does work for simple forms, but definitely has a variety of quirks on different browsers/devices. Blank dates are especially quirky. Try “tabbing” through a date on iPhone or iPad and have some poor UI. datepicker really doesn’t work well for some less common situations (cut n paste, copy, from/to date, restricted date min/max past/future, year pick, month pick, etcetera).replylaurels-marts root | This is my biggest criticism of all these modern HTML pseudo components. It’s a wonderful idea, truly, but if you don’t provide style hooks to customize and theme them they are useless.A month ago I wanted to use the input + datalist to have a searchable drop-down but there was no way to control where the dropdown will appear when popped open and what width will it have. Eventually I just gave up. Such a shame.replyzelphirkalt root | I think the idea is rather, that you \"extend\" by composing primitive elements, and not that you change the primitive elements.

To me a lot of these are going to be immensely useful tools in combination with the TS heavy frameworks we use for modern Enterprise App frontends, exactly because they are HTML native tools that aren’t going to require a bunch of stuff.Like the meter tag, which I assume will replace every loading module we currently use in React when I get to work today because that is soooooooo much better than what we currently use.But maybe I’m just misunderstanding people, or the article in some way.

I have, sadly, no illusions of a JS-free web, but at least we could get rid of huge gobs of it and have more-standard UX that the system can help guide and shape (with the benefits that entails).It also enables a whole slew of new applications to be made that need way less JS than we used to need.

To be completely honest CICS was better than most GUI attempts from Java and C#, and it was a console UI.I'm not saying JS frameworks can't be overused.

Their power comes from most users not resisting that temptation.Becoming the equivalent of a digital hermit and living in a hole in the ground outside these walls, which is what I would characterize this as, is not going to result on a lot of people stepping outside those walls. If you've ever watched Life of Brian, you'll have a good mental picture here.It's a variation of brutalist web development (let's not call it design) that just doesn't really appeal to the masses. It never has. The history of the web is endless attempts to pimp it with Applets, Flash, Shockwave, Silverlight, etc. The latest incarnation of that is web assembly. This basically allows you to use anything native that works elsewhere (desktop, mobile, game consoles, AR/VR, etc.) in a browser as well.Of course there's a severe risk of this to disappear into more walled gardens. But I don't think sitting in a dusty old hole in the middle of nowhere while shaking your fists at progress does much to change that.replyzelphirkalt Sometimes though, that dusty hole in the middle of nowhere seems to be the most progressive in terms of using standards, when the person sitting in it adopts new HTML elements, immediately having accessibility, while their JS-based rivals still struggle with restoring the functionality of the back button and adding routes in their SPA to get back something resembling normal linking behavior. In a way that is a much deeper dusty hole in the ground to dig for oneself.Anyway, it is questionable, how much progress there is in moving into walled gardens and throwing multi megabyte websites at visitors, when we can have the same functionality with less.replybeej71 I think there's a middle ground here where we're building good-looking web pages with a sub-10 MB weight.

On its HN submission (referencing the wrong URL, so I resubmitted [1]) he defends against criticism [2]Quoting from the doc here's the stack:- WebAssembly (also known as Wasm) provides a portable compilation target for programming languages beyond JavaScript; it is being actively extended with features such as WasmGC. - WebGPU provides an API (to JavaScript) that exposes a modern computation and rendering pipeline. - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) provides an ontology for enabling accessibility of arbitrary content. - WebHID provides an API (to JavaScript) that exposes the underlying input devices on the device.This document proposes to enable browsers to render web pages that are served not as HTML files, but as Wasm files, skipping the need for HTML, JS, and CSS parsing in the rendering of the page, by having the WebGPU, ARIA, and WebHID APIs exposed directly to Wasm.[0] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1peUSMsvFGvqD5yKh3GprskLC...[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36968263[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34612696replytroupo > On its HN submission (referencing the wrong URL) he defends against criticism [1]And it's a very weak defence. There are great rebuttals to whatever he writes in there.I mean, he rants that HTML failed, and then literally proposes \"By providing low-level primitives instead, applications could ship with their own implementations of high-level concepts like layout, widgets, and gestures, enabling a much richer set of interactions and custom experiences with much less effort on the part of the developer.\"Has he tried to implement any of those from scratch using only low-level primitives? How is it \"much less effort on the developer\"?In general it just reads like a justification for Flutter:\"This API alone is not useful for application developers, since it provides no high-level primitives. However, as with other platforms, powerful frameworks will be developed to target this set of APIs. A proof of concept already exists in Flutter\"Why not provide high-level powerful primitives out of the box? Oh, then Flutter wouldn't have a reason to exist.---As a side note: WebHID is a Chrome-only non-standard.

This would have the advantage that we could start from a clean slate, and the open source interpreter for this technology could be integrated into all Web browsers, so behavior would be identical.UIML would be designed as an XML application for networked software applications' user interfaces.Of course, you could execute them locally, too. There could be graphical UI designer of the types that already exist, e.g. Visual Studio would just write out a UIML as a new export format.Crazy idea? Actually, it's just applying the \"Do one thing, and do it well.\" mantra to XMLXHTML + UIML instead of packing everything possible into one now-bloated markup language it was never designed to do.

Round-tripping to the server is much slower than client-side JS. It should be terrible for fast keyboard navigation, for instance. You might not notice on a server on localhost or on fast internet (which is very user-hostile to assume).That said, this is me speaking about htmx based on what I know about it. They may have some tricks up their sleeves these days to account for those issues. But those tricks would need JS.replyinfogulch root | That's a common argument, but how often are you navigating around in a web app and you don't need data from the server? IME you do like 80+% of the time so \"responsiveness\" is false anyway, and when you don't you could get pretty far with basic http caching. And assuming high bandwidth is just as bad if not worse than assuming high latency, where typical web app dev platforms perform abysmially not to mention multiple extra round trips and device speed/power. And you could get into the hydration and SSR mess, but then you could just render on the server in the first place and simplify the entire system, reduce your LOC by 5x, opt out of the entire js ecosystem shitshow (or keep it for select high interactivity components, I won't judge), and eliminate an entire api that doesn't need to exist.If you are building the next google maps, maybe htmx isn't for you. But if you're building another LOB app with mainly forms and data views, or an ecommerce site, or another CMS, there's a 99% chance that htmx is plenty.Personally, I'm betting that you can make a whole interactive site on top of Go's html/template library + htmx, using a pattern I'm developing here: https://github.com/infogulch/caddy-xtemplate I'm currently co-developing this with an rss reader webapp to work out the kinks.replyklabb3 root | You make good points. And these are different use cases, where one is simple client behavior where JS is suitable, whereas the other needs a round trip anyway.I wouldn’t go as far as 99%. There are a lot of web apps where you toggle between panes, expand certain things, and so on. But I think you are still right in the sense that htmx is a very fruitful starter kit that can cover many if not most “boring” standard use cases.One thing is for sure, this SSR hydration shit show is not a good state of affairs. It’s way too much complexity for what it does.

If anything CSS is the one thing that's gotten easier in web dev. It might take some time but you'll be able to grok it for sure if you've dealt with old school CSS.replypcthrowaway root | ehh... more organized / better? Sure.Easier? Well, even if you don't have to deal with legacy styling (which had moments of insanity, like floats, and other things which were fairly reasonable, like tables, br, b, i), there is so much new CSS to replace the old: variables, transforms, complex animations, using borders to make arrows and other visual content, in flow vs out of flow, container queries, view transitions api, px, pt, em, rem, vh, vw, query units, initial vs inherit, vs unset vs revert, new color formats, a million new properties for the complexity of interactivity with the gamut of user agent form factorsYou know what? I'm going to stop because the list goes on and I don't even think I touched on 1% of the \"new\" CSSThese days I mostly just use tailwind. It gives me a sane, easy to work with api, and the updates are a more manageable trickle than a delugereplyClosi root | By easier they probably mean “it’s easier to do the same thing” - eg centering a div.It’s also become deeper at the same time though - so it might be easier to do the same thing and harder to know it all.replyklabb3 root | CSS is huge. I wish there was a way to shed all that dead skin. Only 5% of it is truly powerful. Most of it is never used.replymanuelmoreale root | And yet, those rare times you need something you’re happy to know the feature is there.There’s no point in removing stuff from CSS. The only thing that would do is break old websites.If only 5% is truly powerful you can easily and happily use only that 5%replySoraNoTenshi Very surprising to me was that there is a semantic difference inand(the same is also the case withand ) apparently, also PDA readers for e.g., blind people are also aware of this semantic difference.What was also surprising is that there is a Slider as well as Color picker element.Fair enough i am not much of a web person myself, but i know that a lot of webpages have their own custom JavaScript implementation of those elements (if needed).replyzelphirkalt > Very surprising to me was that there is a semantic difference inand(the same is also the case withand ) apparently, also PDA readers for e.g., blind people are also aware of this semantic difference.It is in the names: = emphasized, as in \"this part of the text should be emphasized in whatever way the styling dictates = italic, just a way to style directly = strongly emphasized = bold, just a way to style directly anddo not make a statement about semantics, they are for styling, and probably not much used in modern valid HTML, or at least should not, if you have CSS available.andmake statements about importance of a part of text, in whatever way you want to style that. It just happens, that the default styling for those is italic and bold.replynologic01 HTML is one of these technologies that (still) feels pregnant with infinite possibilities. But we can't really project meaningfully what can / should happen to the web platform (and the role of HTML in it) without considering the tortured trajectory it already has traversed, e.g., the major XHTML vs HTML5 (or W3C vs WHATWG) battles, its more recent \"annihilation\" in the hands of SPA and JS frameworks and the multiple roles it can play. In a sense HTML is too powerful for its own good. So prevailing interests will always try to tame it towards their own needs.HTML is the conduit and enabler of at least three distinct functionalities that are made available by a decentralized internet comprising clusters of server and client machines:* transmitting the information to implement hypertext (=the simplest implementation of linked textual documents). This transmission of linked natural language data has changed the world already and is sufficient to support e.g., a planet of interconnected bloggers. HTML purists (like the OP) focus on this angle but this is very limiting and will never unlock all the positive potential of the web.* transmitting semantically annotated non-text data of all types (numerical, graphical, objects etc). This vision has never really materialized in either its XHTML or SVG guises. Today the only hint that HTML is capable of transmitting such data is the table element. Yet it has enough in-principle semantics to transmit any JSON object.* transmitting UI elements. Why do we need UI elements at all and are they intrinsically evil? The core function of UI elements, both the semantic aspect (hierarchical relations) and the geometric aspect (i.e. CSS and mapping stuff to a 2D screen) are essential and entirely benign. They simply help organize more complex patterns. HTML ultras that avoid CSS essentially rely on default such mappings.Imho an alternative vision to the degenerate web of today that is simply the funnel that gets you to the walled gardens built by adtech (actually humanity grinding machines) must stop being naive, simplistic and Luddite. In all these web technologies of yesterday you can trace battles that were lost, paths not taken.The web we want is an empowering, democratic, decentralized platform that respects and elevates individuals in the digital realm. This web is not tech-phobic. It is confident and develops / adopts any and all technologies that fit is values.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWGreplykoito17 I noticedmade the list but not .

This should be enough to discourage most people.replypetepete root | There are some situations where date pickers do make sense, like when booking an appointment in the future - being able to see the day is useful. Being able to overlay the date picker with other information like days where you're free or when appointment slots are available makes them unbeatable.But, when asking for a date people know, like their date of birth, date pickers just slow people down and confuse them.

    "originBody": "Blog Features Download Documentation Forum Donate Source Nim v2.0 released01 August 2023The Nim TeamThe Nim team is proud and happy to announce Nim version 2.0.This is an evolution (not revolution) of Nim, bringing ORC memory management as a default, along with many other new features and improvements.Nim is a programming language that is good for everything, but not for everybody. It focusses on the imperative programming paradigm and enhances it with a macro system. Its customizable memory management makes it well suited for unforgiving domains such as hard realtime systems and system programming in general.Installing Nim 2.0 New usersCheck out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0 or install it as described here.Existing usersIf you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim, getting Nim 2.0 is as easy as:$ choosenim update stable Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0 from our nightlies builds.Donating to NimWe would like to encourage you to donate to Nim. The donated money will be used to further improve Nim by creating bounties for the most important bugfixes and features.You can donate via:Open Collective Bitcoin: 1BXfuKM2uvoD6mbx4g5xM3eQhLzkCK77tJIf you are a company, we also offer commercial support.New features Better tuple unpackingTuple unpacking for variables is now treated as syntax sugar that directly expands into multiple assignments. Along with this, tuple unpacking for variables can now be nested.proc returnsNestedTuple(): (int, (int, int), int, int) = (4, (5, 7), 2, 3)# Now nesting is supported! let (x, (_, y), _, z) = returnsNestedTuple()Improved type inferenceA new form of type inference called top-down inference has been implemented for a variety of basic cases.For example, code like the following now compiles:let foo: seq[(float, byte, cstring)] = @[(1, 2, \"abc\")]Forbidden TagsTag tracking now supports the definition of forbidden tags by the .forbids pragma which can be used to disable certain effects in proc types.For example:type IO = object ## input/output effect proc readLine(): string {.tags: [IO].} = discard proc echoLine(): void = discardproc no_IO_please() {.forbids: [IO].} = # this is OK because it didn't define any tag: echoLine() # the compiler prevents this: let y = readLine()New standard library modulesThe famous os module got an overhaul. Several of its features are available under a new interface that introduces a Path abstraction. A Path is a distinct string, which improves the type safety when dealing with paths, files and directories.Use:std/oserrors for OS error reporting. std/envvars for environment variables handling. std/paths for path handling. std/dirs for directory creation/deletion/traversal. std/files for file existence checking, file deletions and moves. std/symlinks for symlink handling. std/appdirs for accessing configuration/home/temp directories. std/cmdline for reading command line parameters. Overloadable enumsOverloadable enums are no longer experimental.For example:type E1 = enum value1, value2 E2 = enum value1, value2 = 4const Lookuptable = [ E1.value1: \"1\", value2: \"2\" ] The types E1 and E2 share the names value1 and value2. These are overloaded and the usual overload disambiguation is used so that the E1 or E2 prefixes can be left out in many cases. These features are most beneficial for independently developed libraries.Default values for objectsInside an object declaration, fields can now have default values:type Rational* = object num: int = 0 den: int = 1var r = Rational() assert $r == \"(num: 0, den: 1)\" These default values are used when the field is not initialized explicitly. See also default values for object fields for details.Definite assignment analysisWe found Nim’s default initialization rule to be one major source of bugs. There is a new experimental switch called strictDefs that protects against these bugs. When enabled, it is enforced that a variable has been given a value explicitly before the variable can be used:{.experimental: \"strictDefs\".}proc main = var r: Rational echo r # Warning: use explicit initialization of 'r' for clarity [Uninit]main() To turn the warning into an error, use --warningAsError:Uninit:on on the command line.The analysis understands basic control flow so the following works because every possible code path assigns a value to r before it is used:{.experimental: \"strictDefs\".}proc main(cond: bool) = var r: Rational if cond: r = Rational(num: 3, den: 3) else: r = Rational() echo rmain(false) Even better, this feature works with let variables too:{.experimental: \"strictDefs\".}proc main(cond: bool) = let r: Rational if cond: r = Rational(num: 3, den: 3) else: r = Rational() echo rmain(false) It is checked that every let variable is assigned a value exactly once.Strict effects--experimental:strictEffects are now always enabled. Strict effects require callback parameters to be annotated with effectsOf:func sort*[T](a: var openArray[T], cmp: proc (x, y: T): int {.closure.}, order = SortOrder.Ascending) {.effectsOf: cmp.} The meaning here is that sort has the effects of cmp: sort can raise the exceptions of cmp.Improved error message for type mismatch proc foo(s: string) = discard proc foo(x, y: int) = discard proc foo(c: char) = discardfoo 4 produces:temp3.nim(11, 1) Error: type mismatch Expression: foo 4 [1] 4: int literal(4)Expected one of (first mismatch at [position]): [1] proc foo(c: char) [1] proc foo(s: string) [2] proc foo(x, y: int)Consistent underscore handlingThe underscore identifier (_) is now generally not added to a scope when used as the name of a definition. While this was already the case for variables, it is now also the case for routine parameters, generic parameters, routine declarations, type declarations, etc. This means that the following code now does not compile:proc foo(_: int): int = _ + 1 echo foo(1)proc foo[_](t: typedesc[_]): seq[_] = @[default(_)] echo foo[int]()proc _() = echo \"_\" _()type _ = int let x: _ = 3 Whereas the following code now compiles:proc foo(_, _: int): int = 123 echo foo(1, 2)proc foo[_, _](): int = 123 echo foo[int, bool]()proc foo[T, U](_: typedesc[T], _: typedesc[U]): (T, U) = (default(T), default(U)) echo foo(int, bool)proc _() = echo \"one\" proc _() = echo \"two\"type _ = int type _ = floatJavaScript codegen improvementThe JavaScript backend now uses BigInt for 64-bit integer types (int64 and uint64) by default. As this affects JS code generation, code using these types to interface with the JS backend may need to be updated. Note that int and uint are not affected.For compatibility with platforms that do not support BigInt and in the case of potential bugs with the new implementation, the old behavior is currently still supported with the command line option --jsbigint64:off.Docgen improvementsMarkdown is now the default markup language of doc comments (instead of the legacy RstMarkdown mode). In this release we begin to separate RST and Markdown features to better follow the specification of each language, with the focus on Markdown development. See also the docs.Added a {.doctype: Markdown | RST | RstMarkdown.} pragma allowing to select the markup language mode in the doc comments of the current .nim file for processing by nim doc:Markdown (default) is basically CommonMark (standard Markdown) + some Pandoc Markdown features + some RST features that are missing in our current implementation of CommonMark and Pandoc Markdown. RST closely follows the RST spec with few additional Nim features. RstMarkdown is a maximum mix of RST and Markdown features, which is kept for the sake of compatibility and ease of migration.Added separate md2html and rst2html commands for processing standalone .md and .rst files respectively (and also md2tex/rst2tex).Added Pandoc Markdown bracket syntax [...] for making anchor-less links.Docgen now supports concise syntax for referencing Nim symbols: instead of specifying HTML anchors directly one can use original Nim symbol declarations (adding the aforementioned link brackets [...] around them). To use this feature across modules, a new importdoc directive was added. Using this feature for referencing also helps to ensure that links (inside one module or the whole project) are not broken.Added support for RST & Markdown quote blocks (blocks starting with >).Added a popular Markdown definition lists extension.Added Markdown indented code blocks (blocks indented by >= 4 spaces).Added syntax for additional parameters to Markdown code blocks:nim test=\"nim c $1\" ...C++ interop enhancementsNim 2.0 takes C++ interop to the next level with the new virtual pragma and the extended constructor pragma. Now one can define constructors and virtual procs that map to C++ constructors and virtual methods, allowing one to further customize the interoperability. There is also extended support for the codeGenDecl pragma, so that it works on types.It’s a common pattern in C++ to use inheritance to extend a library. Some even use multiple inheritance as a mechanism to make interfaces.Consider the following example:struct Base { int someValue; Base(int inValue){ someValue = inValue; }; };class IPrinter { public: virtual void print() = 0; };type Base* {.importcpp, inheritable.} = object someValue*: int32 IPrinter* {.importcpp.} = objectconst objTemplate = \"\"\" struct $1 : public $3, public IPrinter { $2 }; \"\"\";type NimChild {.codegenDecl: objTemplate.} = object of Baseproc makeNimChild(val: int32): NimChild {.constructor: \"NimClass('1 #1) : Base(#1)\".} = echo \"It calls the base constructor passing \" & $this.someValue this.someValue = val * 2 # Notice how we can access `this` inside the constructor. It's of the type `ptr NimChild`.proc print*(self: NimChild) {.virtual.} = echo \"Some value is \" & $self.someValuelet child = makeNimChild(10) child.print() It outputs:It calls the base constructor passing 10 Some value is 20ARC/ORC refinementsWith the 2.0 release, the ARC/ORC model got refined once again and is now finally complete:Programmers now have control over the “item was moved from” state as =wasMoved is overridable. There is a new =dup hook which is more efficient than the old combination of =wasMoved(tmp); =copy(tmp, x) operations. Destructors now take a parameter of the attached object type T directly and don’t have to take a var T parameter.With these important optimizations we improved the runtime of the compiler and important benchmarks by 0%! Wait … what? Yes, unfortunately it turns out that for a modern optimizer like in GCC or LLVM there is no difference.But! This refined model is more efficient once separate compilation enters the picture. In other words, as we think of providing a stable ABI it is important not to lose any efficiency in the calling conventions.Tool changesNim now ships Nimble version 0.14 which added support for lock-files. Libraries are stored in $nimbleDir/pkgs2 (it was $nimbleDir/pkgs before). Use nimble develop --global to create an old style link file in the special links directory documented here.nimgrep now offers the option --inContext (and --notInContext), which allows to filter only matches with the context block containing a given pattern.nimgrep: names of options containing “include/exclude” are deprecated, e.g. instead of --includeFile and --excludeFile we have --filename and --notFilename respectively. Also, the semantics are now consistent for such positive/negative filters.Nim now ships with an alternative package manager called Atlas. More on this in upcoming versions.Porting guide Block and BreakUsing an unnamed break in a block is deprecated. This warning will become an error in future versions! Use a named block with a named break instead. In other words, turn:block: a() if cond: break b() Into:block maybePerformB: a() if cond: break maybePerformB b()Strict funcsThe definition of \"strictFuncs\" was changed. The old definition was roughly: “A store to a ref/ptr deref is forbidden unless it’s coming from a var T parameter”. The new definition is: “A store to a ref/ptr deref is forbidden”.This new definition is much easier to understand, but the price is some expressibility. The following code used to be accepted:{.experimental: \"strictFuncs\".}type Node = ref object s: stringfunc create(s: string): Node = result = Node() result.s = s # store to result[] Now it has to be rewritten to:{.experimental: \"strictFuncs\".}type Node = ref object s: stringfunc create(s: string): Node = result = Node(s: s)Standard librarySeveral standard library modules have been moved to nimble packages, use nimble or atlas to install them:std/punycode => punycode std/asyncftpclient => asyncftpclient std/smtp => smtp std/db_common => db_connector/db_common std/db_sqlite => db_connector/db_sqlite std/db_mysql => db_connector/db_mysql std/db_postgres => db_connector/db_postgres std/db_odbc => db_connector/db_odbc std/md5 => checksums/md5 std/sha1 => checksums/sha1 std/sums => sumsUnless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

    "commentBody": "Nim 2.0 (nim-lang.org)463 points by kindaAnIdiot 192 commentsnetbioserror 1Been happily crunching away at Nim in production. I'm working on what is mainly a data analysis and report generation tool, compiled as a CLI executable that gets called by server scripts.Nim makes fast, small executables. It has an excellent heterogenous JSON data structure and a good dataframe library. It prefers the stack so strongly that dynamic data structures (sequences and tables, basically its lists and dictionaries) are pointers on the stack to heap data, where the lifetime is managed by the stack frame. I don't think I have any dynamic references anywhere in my program, and don't have to worry about GC at all. The type system is simple, sensible, and guides you to correctness with ease. Nim also defaults to referential transparency; everything is passed immutably by-value unless you opt out. Generics are powerful and work exactly as you expect, no surprises. Universal function call syntax is ridiculously powerful: You can write the equivalents to methods and interfaces on types just by making procedures and functions that take a first parameter of that type; not needing those abstractions greatly simplifies and flattens code structure. It's just procedures and objects (functions and structs) all the way down.It's been a real joy to work with and reminds me of when I discovered D back in the day, only it's even better. If you imagine native-compiled type-annotated Python where nearly 100% of your code is business logic with no cruft, you're getting close to the Nim experience.replypavlov 1> “It prefers the stack so strongly that dynamic data structures (sequences and tables, basically its lists and dictionaries) are pointers on the stack to heap data, where the lifetime is managed by the stack frame.”Isn’t that the same as a C++ vector or map on stack? They allocate internally as needed, and the whole container is destroyed when it goes out of scope.replyseertaak 1root | It very much is, and the point is, it _used_ to be more like java. Araq basically pulled off a very daring switchover from reference based language system to a value based one.So now the language can credibly claim the same as c++ - no room left closer to the metal. But it's packaged in a much nicer syntax (imho), and has features like macros which we can expect I'm C++ in maybe 10 years, if we're lucky.replynetbioserror 1root | Basically, but it requires no extra syntax. `var some_seq = @[1, 2, 3, 4]` is a stack-managed sequence. That's all there is to it. There's no unwrapping any pointers or boxes or what-not, the type is just `seq[int]`. Put another way, things that have become best practice in C++ are default in Nim with no syntactic noise.replyCyberDildonics 1root | There's no unwrapping any pointers or boxes or what-notThat doesn't happen by default in C++ either.std::vector some_seq{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7};replyjcelerier 1root | or even just std::vector some_seq{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}; nowadays (for a value of nowadays that is 5 years old for GCC and 6 years old for Clang)replyseertaak 1root | Indeed there's no question that Nim is basically following C++'s lead on this. Nim iirc always had constructors and destructors. Final piece of the puzzle is move semantics, and I recall a blog post where Araq came up with something very similar.replyshirleyquirk 1root | yes, Nim has move semantics, but takes care of you more than c++ does. for example, if you use an object that was previously moved, you dont get garbage, the compiler turns the first move into a copy (and tells you)the relevant docs are here: https://nim-lang.org/docs/destructors.htmlreplyremram 1root | Agreed, only being able to put pointers on the stack, no data, would make me think it \"prefers the heap\".replynetbioserror 1root | Dynamic data structures by their nature have to be allocated to the heap. What I mean by \"prefers the stack\" is that you don't have to make a managed ref and dereference a managed pointer type. You just make a `seq[int]`, use it as a `seq[int]`, and pass it as a `seq[int]`, just like stack data. Behind the scenes, it has a unique scoped pointer with no mental overhead.replyjitl 1root | Sounds like a vector/array/list in any other language after C++, like Go slice, Java ArrayList, Javascript array, Python list, Rust vec. Is there something I'm missing?replygcoakes 1root | I think they're discussing the lifetime of that heap data, not whether the data is heap allocated.replychc 1root | I don't see them drawing any distinctions from C++ or Rust there either. It really sounds to me like most of their low-level experience is in C, where the contrasts they appear to be drawing really do apply.replykragen 1root | it depends on what you mean by 'dynamic' and 'stack'; certainly, outside of nim, you can allocate a list of, say, integers entirely on a stack in any of the following cases:- the size of the list is known when you create a stack frame, as in c:int xs[n] = {0};- when the list grows, it grows in that subroutine and not some callee, for example using alloca();- the list is built on a stack that isn't the one you have to pop your return address off of; examples include perl's data stack, ada's secondary stack, forth's operand stack, forth's dictionary, or an mlkit region. in these cases you can even return the dynamically built structure to a caller;- each new callee adds some fixed number of items to a linked list, such as, in cvoid with_fill(color *c,env *e,void (*cb)(void*, env*),void *userdata) { env ne = { .prop = PROP_FILL_COLOR, .val = c, .parent = e }; cb(userdata, &ne); }look ma, no heapreplyarc619 1root | Types are stack allocated by default.\"var data: MyObject\" is on the stack. \"var arr: array[1000, MyObject]\" is allocated on the stack sequentially.Only dynamic seq or ref types use the heap by default.replypavlov 1root | So, same as C++.replyechelon 1root | Same as Rust. Vec and HashMap are stack pointers to the heap-allocated container storage space.replyZamiel_Snawley 1You have convinced me to look in to Nim! Can you speak to the build system(s)? CMake is the bane of my existence.replyPMunch 1root | Another Nim user here. Typically you just build the project by `nim c `, since Nim has such a strong macro system a lot of typical build stuff is just done with macros. Of course there's also the default Nimble package manager which allows you to list dependencies and tasks using Nim itself. This means that if you know how to write Nim managing the build system is a breeze.replyinv2004 root | I did a lot of nim small projects. All of them are on nimble build system: https://github.com/inv2004replyelcritch 1root | Ugh, I just got done spending months fighting CMake before moving back to a position using Nim!You can also compile C projects with Nim like bearssl [1]. Nim takes care to compile the C files and recompile them when config flags change. It's actually really nice.1: https://github.com/status-im/nim-bearssl/blob/99fcb3405c55b2...replynetbioserror 1root | Gotta be honest here, I use a pretty simple Makefile. I don't have anyone else working on this program, so I can afford simplicity.reply999900000999 1It does indeed look like Python!I hope it gets more popular, seems like a much much easier to use Rustreplyshmageggy 1This sounds great. How is the package management story, and how robust is the ecosystem currently?replyFireInsight 1root | You can check out the list of Nim packages at https://nimble.directoryreplyshirleyquirk 1root | The ecosystem is smaller than some, but wrapping libraries is mostly automatable, and there is tooling to assist interop with python, c, and c++replym0do1 1root | This provides a good overview of packages for various applications: https://github.com/ringabout/awesome-nimI think most of them are available via nimble.replyarc619 1Looking forward to trying out this release!After programming professionally for 25 years, IMO Nim really is the best of all worlds.Easy to write like Python, strongly typed but with great inference, and defaults that make it fast and safe. Great for everything from embedded to HPC.The language has an amazing way of making code simpler. Eg UFCS, generics, and concepts give the best of OOP without endless scaffolding to tie you up in brittle data relationships just to organise things. Unlike Python, though, ambiguity is a compile time error.I find the same programs are much smaller and easier to read and understand than most other languages, yet there's not much behind the scenes magic to learn because the defaults just make sense.Then the compile time metaprogramming is just on another level. It's straightforward to use, and a core part of the language's design, without resorting to separate dialects or substitution games. Eg, generating bespoke parsing code from files is easy - removing the toil and copypasta of boilerplate. At the same time, it compiles fast.IMHO it's easier to write well than Python thanks to an excellent type system, but matches C/C++ for performance, and the output is trivial to distribute with small, self contained executables.It's got native ABI to C, C++, ObjC, and JS, a fantasic FFI, and great Python interop to boot. That means you can use established ecosystems directly, without needing to rewrite them.Imagine writing Python style pseudoocode for ESP32 and it being super efficient without trying, and with bare metal control when you want. Then writing a web app with backend and frontend in the same efficient language. Then writing a fast paced bullet hell and not even worrying about GC because everything's stack allocated unless you say otherwise. That's been my Nim experience. Easy, productive, efficient, with high control.For business, there's a huge amount of value in hacking up a prototype like you might in Python, and it's already fast and lean enough for production. It could be a company's secret weapon.So, ahem. If anyone wants to hire a very experienced Nim dev, hit me up!replyfwsgonzo 1I've been using it as a scripting target for both games and other things I'm not allowed to elaborate on simply because it can transpile to C and C++. It's just really really nice to be able to manage the underlying run-time (the C environment) and on the top of that be able to use a high-level modern language with so many first-class citizen things (like JSON).It really is a nicer, better Python. And I say that as someone who does like Python.replyXeamek 1>Then writing a web app with backend and frontend in the same efficient language.How does that work? What i mean specifically is how convenient is it to use js interop in dev time, and not just compile nim to js as a standalone lib?Can we simply call something like browser API directly from Nim (Or with fairly simple wrapper)?replyPMunch 1root | Since Nim compiles to JS and C you just have to tell Nim what is available dn the target language and you can call stuff just as if it was a Nim function. These definitions can be auto generated, and they can live in a package you can simply import.replyFireInsight 1root | I think you can just import dom and get access to browser APIs.replyelcritch 1> Imagine writing Python style pseudoocode for ESP32 and it being super efficient without trying, and with bare metal control when you want.To be fair, I did have to spend like 2 hours tuning my ESP32 code for handling a 22 kSPS ADC where microseconds matter. ;) Mostly just to avoid extra allocations as I was pretty new to Nim at the time.Ah, but no major regressions in performance or changes needed for ~4 years!replytalldrinkofwhat 1Ahem. Ahem.Contact info?replymoigagoo 1root | Are you hiring Nim devs?replyarc619 1root | Shoot me an email at arctsint@proton.me Cheers!replymoigagoo 1Congratulations to everyone involved and the entire Nim community!Nim has been my language of choice for the past decade and I'm really happy with the new features in Nim 2.0. Some of them are real gamechangers for my projects. For example, default values for objects theoretically allow me to make Norm[1] work with object types along with object instances. And the new overloadable enums is something Karkas [2] wouldn't be possible at all (it's still WIP though).[1] https://norm.nim.town[2] https://karkas.nim.townreplyarc619 1Of all the recent changes, default values is my favorite. Aside from generally useful and further reducing the need for initialisation boilerplate, I lets us guarantee valid state at compile time for things like enums - and, I assume, object variants?replysquarefoot 1If someone at Manning Publications is reading this, it would be great to have a book on the newer Nim version, but please consider using a different typesetting with more readable fonts. I purchased the great book by Dominik Picheta, but am forced to use the .pdf because the dead tree version uses thin fonts that I find extremely hard to read even with the right pair of glasses. Font components (arms, lines, stems, etc) are just too thin. Not being a youngster anymore, I naturally thought it was my fault and took the original K&R 2nd ed as a comparison, but still can read it perfectly.replyalwaysbeconsing 1araq/Andreas Rumpf, the project lead, has also published a book: https://nim-lang.org/blog/2022/06/29/mastering-nim.htmlreplypzo 1root | unfortunately there is no ebook version and it seems araq is against publishing ebook (probably because of worrying about piracy) - for me who is travelling a lot, hard copy is a no go.replyTiberium 1root | Araq has mentioned he'll create a new edition of the book for Nim 2.0, and publish it as an e-book, see https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/10366replyuticus 1Not with Manning, but if you have a login you can submit this sort of request via their contact page:https://www.manning.com/contactreply127 1Nim is really very nice language to write software in. Ship fast, enjoy the ride, produce very performant software. Unfortunately it still in my experience has some sharp edges: juggling C/C++ compilers and options, very poor error messages, very situational libraries that only work on some settings and systems. Given the small community, tho, I can't really fault them for it. The VS Code integration works very well in my experience, rarely crashing.replyphilkrylov At least error reporting has been improved recently: https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/03/31/version-20-rc2.htmlreplyaquova 1Nim has been my favorite language for a while now, and I'm very excited to see version 2.0 finally released. A lot of these features have been items I've been looking forward to for some time.The only downside is some of the included modules being moved to 3rd party repositories, as mentioned at the very bottom. It's not a big deal, but it was nice having SQLite support built into the library. I suppose once you support some databases, you'll be pressured to support more and more. I am a bit surprised to see MD5 and SHA1 support moved out though.replyotherme123 1Libraries stagnate in the batteries included. Python carries some dead batteries since the 90's, but they are required there.While it's nice to have path or logging support in the batteries, some other things are better as third parties, to allow them to evolve.replyj-james 1root | Yes, an experiment was run a while back, incorporating community-maintained code in a \"fusion\" repo shipped with the compiler by default. It didn't work very well. Discoverability and maintainability of stdlib-like things is hard.replylenkite root | In my experience in the batteries included stdlib approach, even if libraries evolve slowly, they tend to get a lot more attention wrt bug-fixing and performance improvements. Go's stdlib is the example here.replytreeform 1I wrote a post on how Reddit uses Nim: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/yvbt4h/why_i_enj...More and more large companies and startups are adopting Nim.Super excited for Nim 2.0 and huge thanks to all who contributed!replyfuzztester 1>More and more large companies and startups are adopting Nim.Ineresting.Are there any stats / data on this, or is it anecdotal?Even if anecdotal, can you name some names?replyThomasTJdev 1root | For startups, you can count us in[1]. Our backend, across all services, is using Nim. [1] https://cxplanner.comreplylairv root | What's the experience of writing web backend with Nim ? Did you use existing libraries / framework ? How good is the concurrency compared to something like Go ?replyThomasTJdev root | One of the reasons for choosing Nim was the ease of getting a production ready web backend. For the core part of managing the backend we are using existing Nim libraries [1], and they are easy to expand and work with. I cannot give you a comparison with Go since I haven't managed that large Go projects - but for Nim we are all into the async and threading. I think the channels within the threading is hardest part in Nim, but work is being done it.[1] https://nimble.directory [1a] https://github.com/dom96/jester/ [1b] https://github.com/planety/Prologue [1c] https://github.com/guzba/mummyreplyfuzztester root | Thanksreplypzo 1Had a look a Nim few months ago - feature wise is a lot of I wish Python had (easy interop with C/C++, static typed, compiled, can be transcompiled and executed on android/iOS), but ecosystem is small even though the language is not new. There is not many high quality libraries such a numpy, scipy, pandas, opencv in python. They lack some big player adopting it - it's too bad Unreal Engine didn't try to adopt Nim instead of creating their own new scripting language Verse.One thing I'm also lucking is out-of-the-box interop with C/C++ libraries without creating own adapters (so that you can just import header and be done with it).Another thing is I wish it had similar easy interop with Rust - just to increase adoption and also because in Rust easier to find high quality cross-platform crates (including mobile) that work without hassle even on mobile devices.I worry in few years either Python will catch up (because of faster python, non-GIL, nuitka, briefcase for mobile etc) or Mojo will eat Nim lunch.replytreeform 1To be fair to Nim, only Python has the huge ML ecosystem of numpy, scipy, pandas, opencv, pytorch, tensorflow, keres... Doing ML/AI style work in anything but python is really hard!That said Nim does have the nimpy library that allows for pretty seamless interop with python. Which means you can just import PyTorch, or scipy, or opencv and use them in Nim.replypzo 1root | for me (mobile developer) interop with python is not enough because of really poor python story on mobile devices (iOS / android) when using native modules. I think if Nim had a seamless interop with Rust or even Zig it could piggyback on those communities to get some libraries for free.replysnthpy root | I found the following article about Nim and Rust interop:https://dev.to/dumblepytech1/the-way-integrate-rust-into-nim...Haven't read it yet but it looks promising.replyElegantBeef 1root | For Rust at least one can use https://github.com/arnetheduck/nbindgenreplysnthpy root | That looks interesting. Unfortunately it looks like it hasn't been updated in a while? Is that because it's complete or a lack of interest?For example, the approach mentioned at the bottom of the README of integrating via nlvm (https://github.com/arnetheduck/nlvm) sounded great but appears to be unpursued.replypzo 1root | that looks interesting, thanks! Did you try it if it delivers on promises? There was not any new commit since 2020 so not sure if the project is stale by now.replyElegantBeef 1root | I do not use Rust, so sadly I have not.replycb321 1root | As a 2-step approach, you could also probably use https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen and then Nim's native C FFI.replyXeamek 1root | Dunno about rust, but since both Nim and Zig compile to C as interim, it should be fairly easy to get them working together, no?replypzo 1root | Things might changed but last time I checked you could easily call C function but you had to kind of export each single C function, structs etc. You couldn't just import single header file and be ready to call any function in the library. There is some pending project [0] futhark but not sure how mature it is and that still only for C libraries (instead of C++ or Rust) but maybe easy adopt for Zig - would be great nonetheless.[0] https://github.com/PMunch/futharkreplyelcritch root | Most of those libraries are written in C++ or C, which Nim has excellent support for. I've used opencv c++ library with Nim. It's just that opencv is so massive it'd take a lot of work to wrap well, so I haven't yet. Some folks are working on a pure Nim pandas lib too.replyafavour 1Congrats to all involved.I find Nim to be an absolutely fascinating language. I've been trying to find a reason to use it on my job (my work is mobile-adjacent so the idea of compiling to JS and to ObjC is fascinating) but haven't gone beyond playing around with it so far. I've been comparing it to Rust and it's just so much simpler to get started with.replyjasfi 1Somewhat related, you can call Nim code from Node.js/Bun using Denim: https://github.com/openpeeps/denim. It works by creating a Node add-on.This is great for reusing Nim code in a web app, and possibly for performance critical code.replyjadbox 1Anyone have working experience with Nim and Zig? I'd love to hear how they are similar and contrast. I'd also would like to see some idiomatic web server benchmarks between the two (now with Nim v2).replykhaledh 1I've used both to work on a hobby OS project (Nim[1], Zig[2]). I very much prefer Nim. Code is succinct, elegant, and lets you focus on your core logic rather than fighting the language.Zig is nice and I like its optionals support and error handling approach. But I was put off by its noisy syntax, e.g. !?[]u8 to represent an error union of an optional pointer to a many-pointer of uint8. Also having to prepare and weave allocators throughout most of the code that needs to dynamically allocate (which is most of the code) gets in the way of the main logic. Even little things like string concatenation or formatting becomes a chore. Zig also doesn't have dynamic dispatch, which makes polymorphic code hard to write; you have to work around it through some form of duck typing. In the end I realized that Zig is not for me.[1] https://github.com/khaledh/axiom [2] https://github.com/khaledh/axiom-zigreplykhaledh 1root | Couldn't edit my post, but forgot to mention my main pain points with Nim have been:- its module system, especially not being able to have mutually recursive imports (there has been a 7 year old proposal[1])- order-sensitive declarations of procs (i.e. can't use a proc defined further down in the file unless you add a forward reference to it). For the latter there's an experimental pragma[2], but it doesn't work a lot of times once you introduce mutually recursive calls- object variants requiring declaration of a separate enum instead of allowing inline declaration of the variant cases, and a close issue[3] with not being able to define the same field names under different variant cases.[1] https://github.com/nim-lang/rfcs/issues/6[2] https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual_experimental.html#code-reor...[3] https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/19replyelcritch 1root | You might like Patty. It makes case types more ergonomic: https://github.com/andreaferretti/pattyreplykhaledh 1root | Neat! Thanks for sharing. This might come in handy, although the constraint of unique field names across variant cases is still there.replyelcritch root | Yah it's annoying, but I just rename one. Beff331 made a lib that uses tuples and avoids the naming issue: https://github.com/beef331/fungusreplygcoakes 1root | > Zig also doesn't have dynamic dispatchIt doesn't have it as a language feature, but it does have VTables just like C would. The `std.mem.Allocator` is an example of this.replyflohofwoe 1I maintain auto-generated bindings for my C libraries for Zig and Nim (and Odin and Rust - although the Rust bindings definitely need some love to make them a lot more idiomatic).I think looking at the examples (which is essentially the same code in different languages) gives you a high level idea, but they only scratch the surface when it comes to language features (for instance the Zig examples don't use any comptime features):Zig: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-zig/tree/master/src/examplesNim: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-nim/tree/master/examplesOdin: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin/tree/main/examplesRust: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-rust/tree/main/examplesreplygrok22 1root | And which language did you enjoy coding in the most? Yeah, a subjective question :-). (Edit: Missed the auto-generated part, so maybe you don't have an opinion on experience regarding this?)replyflohofwoe 1root | I think actually Odin, although I was surprised by that (being more of a Zig fan). Odin has some neat convenience features which are nice for higher level code, while Zig can be a lot more 'draconian' by enforcing correctness even at the cost of some \"line noise\" (but I guess both languages are still in flux, so that might change).As for Nim I enjoyed it initially (because of the Python vibes I guess) but the automatic memory management gets confusing quickly. IIRC there's quite a few different reference types - but maybe that has been simplified in 2.0PS: Even though the bindings are auto-generated, I still try to make them 'language-idiomatic' by injecting some 'semi-manual' mappings for things like naming conventions or implicit type conversions, ideally getting the API close to what a 'native' API would look like - at least that's the goal.replyeterps 1root | This might sound strange, but in my opinion Odin is a Pascal variant with a C like syntax.replyaudunw 1I’ve written programs in both, though it’s been a while since I used Nim now. I think I enjoyed writing Nim more. Zig is more boring, but for all the right reasons. I wouldn’t personally choose to write an OS in Nim, but I think Zig would be great for that when it’s mature. I personally started using it for embedded software.I would probably use Nim for CLI tools, server applications, maybe GUI applications and games too.The Zig teams seems to be putting much more effort into the whole compiler infrastructure, which is really amazing in my experience. There’s some great innovations there.reply59nadir root | I suspect Nim would be much, much harder to wrangle for games than Zig (or easily the best of the bunch: Odin) since it doesn't make enough things clear at all in terms of allocation and only allows indirect control of allocation and deallocation.I wouldn't necessarily prefer Nim for any of the things you listed but this doesn't have the same argument as for games with Odin (which has great tools and libraries for making games as well as gives a much better overview of important things you'll have to care about for making them in terms of performance, etc.).Rather, it's because I've found that Nim belongs with the other languages that think that complexity can be managed by being hidden well enough, which I've found is simply not the case when something actually needs to be debugged or you need to understand the behavior of the program.Hiding/ignoring allocation errors, not making allocation explicit, not making deallocation explicit, etc., makes for a much worse time actually understanding what's going to happen. Adding tons of GC options like alternative GC implementations isn't going to fix it and this new one is really just another example of trying even harder to hide complexity.I think the ultimate irony of these languages that have magical features like move semantics is that they do some of those things in the name of performance but in practice many of them are so complicated to write well-performing code in with these space technology features and non-obvious behavior that the end results are worse than much, much simpler languages. I've also found that these languages' development cycles (for the end user) isn't that much longer than the space tech ones because there is ultimately much, much less to use in them so people end up just writing the actual code instead of trying to wrangle all of the magic.replyxigoi root | Many game developers want to focus on writing games instead of fighting a memory allocator. Unless you're making a 3D game with realistic graphics, you don't need every last bit of performance.reply59nadir root | No one needs to be fighting allocators; they are far less inhibiting and pose less of an issue than GC or RAII will in the vast majority of cases. They're far easier and simpler to deal with on the whole as well. You're always interfacing with memory management somehow and the implicit way is usually much harder to work with overall. The idea that having an allocator and explicitly working with it is for \"that last bit of performance\" is a bit disingenuous, you're usually losing far more than that with implicit allocation and deallocation. On top of that you simply inherently have a harder time understanding the behavior of your program.replyxigoi root | Manual memory management is one more thing to care about instead of the actual logic. With automatic memory management, you don't need to think about memory at all; what could be simpler?reply59nadir root | Easier in the best case and much harder in the worst, when your lack of thinking is an issue (which it definitely will be unless you're prepared to use more of the machine for no reason). Simplicity is not about what's easier to use, it's about how you interface with something, how simple and straight forward that interface is to use, how many things are implicitly or explicitly affected by that thing, and so on. Automatic memory management usually implies an assumption that allocations can't fail, memory is infinite, etc., so the assumptions and complications are many. It also adds more code you didn't write and have no direct control over, which complicates your problem solving in many ways.GC or other automatic memory management is only easier if you have absolutely zero care for resource usage. RAII will oftentimes lead to single allocations and deallocations, for example, unless you take care to not have it be so, which is an immense waste of resources.It's fine if you don't care and you know that that's going to produce slow, bad software, but let's be honest about that instead of saying you can not care and everything will be fine.replysynergy20 1root | nim seems good for embedded too,just use cross c compiler as the backend?replyelcritch root | Yep! https://github.com/EmbeddedNimreplyLexiMax 1I've done green-field work with both Nim and Zig.There were loads of specific differences, but if I could characterize both languages in a simple way:- Nim seems to emphasize being a swiss army knife in the way that Python is, except as a compiled language.- Zig is a much more focused language that tries to hit a certain specific niche - being a successor and replacement for C - and hits that mark spectacularly.I think language preference comes down to what your personal needs and wants out of a new language that isn't being served by whatever you're using currently. I personally landed in the \"Zig\" camp because the way it approaches its ambition of being a C successor is intriguing, but I could see why other people might land on Nim.replyrbjorklin 1Zig doesn’t seem to have an implementation for the TechEmpower Benchmarks but Nim does: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r21&l=y...replyfastball 1root | And I'm surprised by how terribly it ranks – basically dead last against everything, even the Python frameworks, which is impressive.replyelp 1root | Interesting. The Vercel benchmarks make it look pretty good. Only slightly behind rust. https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/zig-vs-ru...

What sense does it make to compare highly focused web server frameworks to languages most simple stdlib implementations, much apples vs oranges.. (thus also not getting why the proposal to compare with actual web frameworks for nim is that much downvoted?!)replyarc619 1root | Too much string copying iirc. It was written a while ago.Hopefully it'll get updated/replaced some time, but there's plenty of faster 3rd party ones already.reply59nadir 1There are a lot of features in Nim that are basically the polar opposite to Zig's values; macros/templates as opposed to comptime which has no real capability of just inserting random code and the very pervasive naked imports (functions/methods can come from anywhere) that are all over the place come to mind, as opposed to the explicit imports and qualified names you would have to use in Zig (or deconstruction of imports to get the bare names, making it obvious where an identifier is coming from).On top of that you have only indirect control over memory allocation and deallocation, which goes completely against Zig's values where custom allocators are used and everything that allocates should take an allocator as an argument (or member in the case of structures). In contrast to that there isn't even the concept of an allocator in the Nim standard library.I would say that my experience with Nim has made me fairly certain that Nim has absolutely no desire to make things obvious but rather chooses convenience over almost everything. It's not so much a competitor (in performance or clarity) to Odin or Zig as it is a competitor to Go or something with a much higher-level baseline.On top of all of this it doesn't really have tagged unions with proper support for casing on them and getting the correct payload type-wise out of them, which is an incredibly odd choice when all of its competitors have exactly that or an equivalent.Overall I would say that coming from Odin or Zig (or Go) and actually liking those languages it's very hard to like Nim. I could imagine that if someone came from a much higher-level language where performance is nearly inscrutable anyway and nothing is really obvious in terms of what it's doing, Nim would feel like more of the same but probably with better performance.Edit:Often while reading the Nim manual, news and forum posts, etc., I get the sense that Nim is really just an ongoing research project that isn't necessarily trying to solve simpler problems it already has along the way. If you look at some of the features in this announcement, it's hard to see anyone ever asking for them, yet here they are. In many ways it's way worse than Haskell, which often gets derided as \"just a research language\". A lot of what Nim has makes for a much worse experience learning and using the language and I'm sure it doesn't get easier in the large.replyj-james 1root | > It's not so much a competitor (in performance or clarity) to Odin or Zig as it is a competitor to Go or somethingThat seems accurate. Dealing with raw pointers as one does in Odin or Zig is very much de-emphasized in favour of dealing with safe references, and a lot of effort is put into optimizing out all the overhead of those reference checks (hence ARC/ORC) and writing code to evade them. The manual memory management features of Nim are there for flexibility and fallbacks and are not really the main way to write code: even for embedded. The stuff that Zig (and Odin?) do surrounding allocators and alignment, and constructs for slightly-safer pointers, are really very interesting yet are most helpful if you are indeed working with pointers and worrying about offsets: which you usually aren't in Nim.I am curious as to what you mean about comptime, though. I have gotten the impression that equivalent constructs in Nim are more powerful. You have `static` blocks and parameters, `const` expressions, `when` conditionals, and then also both templates and typed macros operating on the AST (before or after semantic checking)... `when` even provides for type-checking functions with varying return types (well, monomorphized to one type) via `: auto` or the `: int | bool | ...` syntax.I will also defend \"naked imports\" as a feature that works very well with the rest of the language: functions are disambiguated by signature and not just name and so conflicts scarcely occur (and simply force qualification when they do). And, this allows for the use of uniform function call syntax - being able to call arbitrary functions as \"methods\" on their first parameter. This is incredibly useful and allows for chaining function calls via the dot operator, among other things. Besides, if you really want you can `from module import nil` and enforce full qualification.Interest in proper structural pattern matching sparked back up again recently and some complementary RFCs were proposed: https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/525 and https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/527.reply59nadir 1root | > I will also defend \"naked imports\" as a feature that works very well with the rest of the language: functions are disambiguated by signature and not just name and so conflicts scarcely occur (and simply force qualification when they do).

This is incredibly useful and allows for chaining function calls via the dot operator, among other things. Besides, if you really want you can `from module import nil` and enforce full qualification.This is spot on. You can also not really have productive and well-fitting errors-as-values in a language that emphasizes UFCS, which is why Nim (and D) has/have to have exceptions. In order to productively use errors as values in Nim you either have to chain some kind of `Result` type (which, if you `map` & `mapError` over it will have to be able to implicitly allocate in certain cases, etc.) so the list of potential victims of this (and other features) just seems to go on and on.In general, if you go over the list of features in Nim there is a coherence in them only in that some of the (mis)features actually have to exist in order for other features to make sense. I would feel like it was \"designed\" except in the case of Nim it really feels mostly accidental and not very well though out in general. The end result is (for me) that it feels very much like it ended up on the wrong side of readability, clarity and overall coherence.replyj-james 1root | > You can also not really have productive and well-fitting errors-as-values in a language that emphasizes UFCSEh, https://github.com/arnetheduck/nim-results and associated syntax from https://github.com/codex-storage/questionable would beg to disagree. Nim's stdlib does not have productive and well-fitting errors because it suffers from inertia and started far before the robust wonders of recoverable error handling via errors-as-types entered the mainstream with Rust and were refined with Swift (IMO). Option/Result types are fantastic and I do so wish the standard library used them: but it's nothing a (very large) wrapper couldn't provide, I suppose.I do strongly think that other languages are greatly missing out on UFCS and I miss it dearly whenever I go to write Python or anything else. I'm not quite sure how you think UFCS would make it impossible to have good error handling? Rust also has (limited, unfortunately) UFCS and syntax around error handling does not suffer because of it. If by errors-as-values you mean Go-style error handling, I quite despise it - I think any benefits of the approach are far offset by the verbosity, quite similarly to Java's checked exceptions.(in general concerns surrounding performance of errors surprise me - they're errors! they shouldn't be hit often! but if they are, you can certainly avoid such performance hits in nim.)replyhimujjal 1I loved Nim when I used it first.But I left it because of recursive imports. I had to basically put all my types into one file and use them from various others. For a relatively medium sized project (~10LOC), its a but of a hassle. Refactoring is an issue.That being said, the language is fantastic. Can anybody with experience suggest me what HTTP library/framework do they prefer for servers?replyelcritch 1The lack of recursive imports can be annoying, but I found I don't mind it. It keeps your module tree into a DAG.Chronos is probably the most feature rich and uses async. Mummy is newer and uses a threading model. Both are used in production.replywinrid Node and Python also don't really work with circular imports.replysedatk 1So, Nim doesn’t seem to be under an umbrella of a non-profit. Isn’t this destined to be a problem at some point regarding either acquisition of rights or succession?Edit: Ouch. Just found this thread. Very disappointing, and actually makes a greater case for institutional ownership: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/10312replydemizer 2 On the flip side the Rust Foundation hasn't been that great either...replyskitter 1Was about to bring up that thread. Having a dictator for life isn't a good combination with that dictator going on unprompted, unhinged rants.replydjur I thought it was strange that comments were deleted and the thread was closed for going off the original topic when it was Araq who shifted the topic.replykoromak 1I find using main a little obnoxious, but like who cares that much?replysedatk 1root | I think \"default\" (Mercurial) is a way better name than anything else for the default branch, duh. But, I err on the side of the disadvantaged because it's impossible to fully empathize with their individual experience, so I try to use \"main\" whenever I can.That said, I'm a Slav which is the origin of the word \"slave\" because in Europe, slaves were predominantly Slavs once. I don't really mind it because it feels irrelevant today. Connotations of \"master\" doesn't feel that ancient yet though, considering that black people weren't allowed to live in Palo Alto, CA (heart of Silicon Valley today) until 1950's.replydjur root | Despite the remark about confusing people over 50, a primary branch called \"master\" isn't exactly an unalterable ancient tradition in version control, either. \"Trunk\" was common in centralized VCSes. I had to get used to \"master\" and \"main\" is at worst a lateral move.replymixmastamyk 1root | Right, I found such changes silly as well, but this kind of anger is a bad sign. Sounds like someone watches too much corporate TV.If you can't handle a little silliness from humanity, might as well bow out now.replyimadj 1Just started learning Nim recently and really loving it.Even though it's older than its peers like Rust and Go, it still quite the underdog.Hope more people start paying attention to it.reply0cf8612b2e1e 1Go had full time engineers designing the language, tooling, docs, etc. Nim has never had huge industry sponsorship, so comparing the languages on age alone is hardly fair.replyfrou_dh 1Seems like it kinda has Sum Types, so Nim passes the litmus test for respectable static type-system in this day and age.https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-object-variantsreplyc-cube 1When I looked at it a few years ago, the compiler didn't prevent you from accessing fields from the wrong variant, and didn't provide exhaustivity checks. So I think it still falls short of this (excellent) litmus test :/replyelcritch 1root | They've improved the compiler analysis for them significantly, including exhaustivity checks and field checks.replycobby 1root | Also Nim requires you to use unique field names across all variants.replyalwaysbeconsing 1root | This annoying restriction is lifted in Nim 2; see the linked announcement.replyxigoi 1root | Where in the announcement does it say that?replyElegantBeef 1root | They likely read \"overloadable enums\" and went \"Oh Rust calls their tagged unions enums\" so assumed all languages did.replyalwaysbeconsing root | Oh, no, I actually misunderstood cobby's complaint: the field names, yes, those still have to be unique. Which is also a bit annoying, though I've seen discussions about changing it.replyjackmott42 1I feel the same way as you! I've seen many language ideas come and go in my career and sum types are one I feel now should be a basic requirement. I miss them in any language without them.replyforesto 1> Now one can define constructors and virtual procs that map to C++ constructors and virtual methods, allowing one to further customize the interoperability.I hope this will help with bindings for C++ libraries that have historically been tricky to wrap.For example, I would like to use Qt from a compiled language that's a pleasure to use, and this project looks promising:https://github.com/jerous86/nimqtreplyWhereIsTheTruth 1Could be a fun python alternativeQuestions:- value/object semantic: i peeked at some code, and i can't tell what is a value, and what is a reference type, is everything heap allocated?- tooling: what's the state of their language server? does it work with all of their language features?- debugging: does gdb/lldb understand nim's types and slices?And finally: is a no-gc mode available?I'll play with it later today, it's always been in my todo list of languages to try, now is the perfect timereplyarc619 1Reference semantics are part of the type.So \"var i: int\" is value, \"var i: ref int\" is a heap allocated reference that's deterministically managed like a borrow checked smart pointer, eliding reference counting if possible.You can turn off GC or use a different GC, but some of the stdlib uses them, so you'd need to avoid those or write/use alternatives.Let me say though, the GC is realtime capable and not stop the world. It's not like Java, it's not far off Rust without the hassle.replyjanAkali 11. Nim uses 'var' modifier to pass by reference, e.g. \"proc (n: var int)...\", default behaviour is pass by value. And there're also raw pointers and references (safe pointers).>is a no-gc mode available?You can disable gc, but most of standard library depends on it. But in Nim 2.0 there's finally support for ARC and ORC (ARC + cycle collector).replyElegantBeef 1root | > default behaviour is pass by valueIs not exactly true, smaller than 24 bytes is passed by value, the compiler optimizes larger calls and passes by reference implicitly.replymsk-lywenn 1root | I've been searching and can't find it: A in ARC is for automatic, what does the O stand for?replydinHeld 1root | O is a visual pun because it adds a cycle collector to ARC.replylambertsimnel 1root | I assumed the O was for \"optimised\", but apparently it stands for \"cycle\":https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/12/08/introducing-orc.htmlreplyxigoi > i can't tell what is a valueIf a type is declared with 'ref', it's a reference type. Otherwise, it's a value type.replysynergy20 1nim is a better python(syntax wise) that compiles to c(or c++,js,etc but c is the default) with GC turned on by default. I have always been wanting to use it outside of what my job needs(c/c++/python). I hope some big players adopt Nim to make it one of the mainstream language.replytreeform 1Reddit was hiring for Nim positions. So demand is growing. New languages have easier time being adopted at startups which grow into big players eventually.replyturnsout 1Nim looks awesome. Does anyone know why it doesn't have first-class support for wasm? That's the only thing that would keep me from diving into it more.replyilaksh 1I think the short answer is it's built on top of C tooling so it doesn't really need another way to do it because you can use emscripten. Search their forum for \"web assembly\".I did ask him about it eight years ago: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/1392#8675But that was a little early on and there have been other priorities for the language.replyturnsout 1root | The reason I ask is that I was poking around and saw some projects to help with wasm compilation, and on this random list of wasm-capable languages [0], Nim is listed as \"Work in Progress.\" Notably, Swift is ranked higher, and I view Swift as extremely experimental when it comes to wasm[0]: https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langsreplyelcritch root | With 2.0 out and ORC being default it compiles and works just fine. There's not too many libraries specializing for wasm stuff though, so you gotta use emscriptens or similar.replyhugs 1I suspect it's simply a size-of-community thing. If you want it, you should take a crack at implementing it! Or least start a thread about on the official developer forum.replyCorsome 1next [–]proc echoLine(): void = discardDiscard looks cool! I'm Rust I had to use the unimpl macro crate [0] to get sane error messages. It would be good if that was build in though.[0]: https://crates.io/crates/unimplreplyReleaseCandidat 1As someone who doesn't know much about Nim:Improved type inference ... let foo: seq[(float, byte, cstring)] = @[(1, 2, \"abc\")]This looks like a normal type declaration to me, why is there any inference involved?replyelcritch 1It looks simple but in a typed language it's actually somewhat tricky. The compiler needs to infer that the 1 is a float type, 2 is a byte, and compile it appropriately.Previously Nim didn't do any \"reverse\" type inference so you'd need to say `@[1'f64, 2'byte, \"abc\")]`. That was because it's a constraints problem that can become exponentially expensive to solve. Exploding compile times in Rust and Swift are good examples of this. But there's limited subsets which can still be quick and are helpful like this case.replyReleaseCandidat 1root | > It looks simple but in a typed language it's actually somewhat tricky.But that example looks about as simple as it can be, so I clearly must miss something.> The compiler needs to infer that the 1 is a float type, 2 is a byte, and compile it appropriately.And I don't understand _why_ it has to infer anything, as the type is explicitly declared. I mean, there are 2 possibilities: * 1 is both a valid integer and a float literal => Nim needs the type declaration on the left to unify the type (from \"integer or float\" or \"numeric\" or whatever the type checker inferred) to `float`. * 1 is not a valid float literal (but an integer) => the type is not inferred, but implicitly converted to `float`. In both cases the solution does not involve inference?reply59nadir 1root | You're completely right, but believe it or not Nim 1.6 actually doesn't manage to connect the dots between `1` and it being a possible `float`, `int64`, etc.. Even if you wanted a different size integer literal you'd have to say, for example, `42'int64`. You would be forgiven for asking how the language has purity checks for functions (`func` vs. `proc`) but somehow does not have this fairly elementary implicit type conversion (where Odin manages to even say `1.0` is a valid int value, for example, but won't permit anything that is not safely representable as a conversion).replyelcritch 1root | > And I don't understand _why_ it has to infer anything, as the type is explicitly declared.The seq declaration doesn’t need to be inferred. However the right side does need to be inferred from the declaration.> I mean, there are 2 possibilities: * 1 is both a valid integer and a float literal => Nim needs the type declaration on the left to unify the typeYep, `1` is an ambiguous number literal. So the compiler needs to back the info from the type into the assignment expression. Not super hard to do for simple cases, but it can become expensive for complex types.replyJtsummers 1The problem apparently is that they didn't actually have full type inference and the expressions on the right were given their types (probably a tuple of int x int x cstring) before they attempted the assignment into foo. Now they're using unification (they call it \"top-down inference\", so I'm guessing it's regular unification like other type inference systems use) so that the expression on the right will have the correct type and be assignable into the variable on the left.replyReleaseCandidat 1root | I see, I guess you're right.replybrodouevencode 1What are some noteworthy projects or libraries written in Nim?replyj-james 1Ones that have not been mentioned so far:- npeg lets you write PEGs inline in almost normal notation: https://github.com/zevv/npeg- owlkettle is a declarative macro-oriented library for GTK: https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle- ratel is a framework for embedded programming: https://github.com/PMunch/ratel- futhark provides for much more automatic C interop: https://github.com/PMunch/futhark- nimpy allows calling Python code from Nim and vice versa: https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy- questionable provides a lot of syntax sugar surrounding Option/Result types: https://github.com/codex-storage/questionable- nlvm is an unofficial LLVM backend: https://github.com/arnetheduck/nlvm- chronos is an alternative async/await backend: https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos- cps allows arbitrary procedure rewriting in continuation passing style: https://github.com/nim-works/cpsA longer list can be found at https://github.com/ringabout/awesome-nim.replytreeform 1We have written pixie: https://github.com/treeform/pixie . Pixie is a 2D graphics library similar to Cairo and Skia written entirely in Nim. Which I think is a big accomplishment. It even has python bindings: https://pypi.org/project/pixie-python/replyFireInsight 1root | Is pixie capable of realtime usage like in games or generative art? Last time I looked it seemed CPU-only.replytreeform 1root | Not by itself! But together with other library boxy you can: https://github.com/treeform/boxyYou should use pixie to load textures, create text, rasterize vector graphic etc... and send them to boxy to be drawn every frame.Yes Pixie is CPU only, and just like you can't use Cairo or Skea for real time games you can't use Pixie, but boxy you totally can.replyElegantBeef 1root | I use pixie for my game framework. It's used to load textures, layout fonts, and render font atlases. It can be used for generative art but https://github.com/EriKWDev/nanim or sdl2 using renderer's makes more sense as they are gpu accelerated.replysphars 1Nitter (Twitter frontend) is written in Nim: https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/replyhugs 1I don't know if my particular version is noteworthy, but I recently started making updated Nim bindings for OpenCV and it was kinda fun. I don't consider myself an advanced C++ programmer, but Nim made the process easier than I had feared it would be. https://github.com/tapsterbot/mvb-opencvreplypzo 1root | Not familiar with Nim enough to figure it out - are the bindings auto generated in similar style like opencv bindings to any other supported language (python, julia, objc, rust, etc)?replyhugs 1root | They are currently not auto-generated.

Probably worth taking another look at Nim again.How is interop with Rust these days?replyLexiMax 1The last time I used the language, it was still using a garbage-collector and there were talks about transitioning towards a new way of doing things - I assume that ARC/ORC ended up being that destination.Now that ARC/ORC is considered \"complete,\" are there any remnants of the old GC still in the language, or has the entire ecosystem hopped over?replytreeform 1For most of us the move from GC to Orc is pretty transparent. Most libraries just work and don't require any major restructuring.replyhaolez 1It seems almost too good to be true. Well done!Could someone share some bad experiences when adopting Nim so I can weight that in? I'm seriously considering it.replyj-james 1I have a shortlist of pain points:- Tooling is not great. The language server has a tendency to silently crash on occasion, and it's no rust-analyzer to begin with. A tooling rewrite has been delayed behind proper incremental compilation, which has been delayed behind ARC/ORC...- Interfaces (\"concepts\") are experimental and there are two differing implementations.- It lacks proper sum types and structural pattern matching in the core language. There are a number of quite good macro-based libraries that provide for this, however: fusion/matching, andreaferretti/patty, beef331/fungus, alaviss/union...- Optional types are not the standard: the stdlib will throw exceptions. This is more so a personal preference than anything.But that's about it. I do like Nim quite a lot.replyElegantBeef 1root | > It lacks proper sum typesWe've talked about this before! You know it has sum types, just not the variation you want.replyj-james 1root | I know, I know! I do very much like the \"type wrapper\" approach more than the \"object variant\" approach.Perhaps in the future we'll simply have both and have no reason to debate ;-)replydavidkunz 1Fantastic language, hoping this will lead to increased adoption!replyfithisux 1\"Nim is a programming language that is good for everything, but not for everybody.\"now you got me really interested.At some point dlang-betterc + zig + nim should have an interoperability article and share libraries.replyj-james 1Really, I'm quite hopeful for crabi: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105586An ABI for languages with a proper type system seems fantastic. Swift, Rust, Nim, D all share very similar type systems (and memory management systems) and it would be very cool to see what kinds of interop easy dynamic linking would allow.replyfithisux root | I didn't know about it. Seems life has bright sides too.replywinrid 1I dearly wish there was something like LibGDX for Nim.

I like your mission, but it's very unclear to me why your codebase isn't open and I'd 100% be much more likely to try to help out if it were.reply93po root | If I had to guess: there's likely nothing that special about their Django site for connecting animals to foster parents, and the extra time and potential security risks of of making it open source compared to the benefit it'd provide the open source community doesn't make sense.Volunteer-run tech and IT for non-profits aren't exactly well known for the highest of standards of engineering. The likelihood of someone accidentally leaking AWS creds or other PII seems reasonably possible without well established engineering practices.Alternatively, it may involve proprietary code for a software vendor they work with that they don't have the rights to redistribute.replytheLiminator root | That would just be security through obscurity.I'd be really interested in contributing but I'd hate to be contributing and then find out that this non-profit is actually some rich persons tax avoidance scheme or can be pivoted in a way to make money for someone.Having the source code licensed as GPL or something would make this a smaller concern for me.replydramaquinn root | > I'd be really interested in contributing but I'd hate to be contributing and then find out that this non-profit is actually some rich persons tax avoidance scheme or can be pivoted in a way to make money for someone.Please dont hire this person no matter how much they ask you to.

These SDKs are world-class: you get an idiomatic wrapper with autocomplete, types, etc. (I built a version of this at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)Next, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right. We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.From there, we plan to build out a rich family of developer platform products – everything an API team would need to deliver a terrific DX to their partners and/or customers.We’re about 1.5y old, under 5 people, have strong revenue, and are selling to companies you interact with every day.

Permanent or co-founder roles may be available in the future.Detailed version:We're a vendor of data monitoring and automation technology for small-to-medium sized agriculturalists - mostly growers of wine grapes, fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, etc. Our predecessor companies (which go back as early as 1982) have supplied technology to some of the world's leading food and wine producers, research institutions and agri-business brands.Our main products are:- A data monitor that reads soil moisture and other environmental metrics, and uploads data to the cloud via Cat-M1, and a partner web app that displays data on maps+graphs and manages the devices.- A webapp that displays data from a network of 70+ weather stations across some major growing regions of Australia, and displays weather data updated every 10 minutes and long-term historical graphsWe're looking for people with the following skills:- Electronics engineering - designing circuits and circuit boards for IoT data monitoring/control applications, using Nordic SiP/SoC devices or comparable components. Experience with contemporary cellular data networks (Cat M1, NB-IoT) very welcome, as well as other radio data technologies, e.g., LoraWAN, DigiMesh, ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi.- Programming for above hardware platforms, ideally very experienced with C and the Zephyr platform. Knowledge of Mororola/Freescale assembly language a big advantage, for the purpose of porting functionality from a legacy device.This would be particularly interesting to someone who wants to go deep developing a new hardware/firmware architecture for this industry; something like what Cisco IOS is to networking, but for agriculture data monitoring/control. We’re also considering offering the circuit board as a barebones/OEM product, a-la “Raspberry Pi for agriculture”, so it would be a great opportunity for someone who want to be a part of that.We’re a new, “clean slate” company being established by people with decades of industry/product experience and solid relationships and reputation.

Sign up for it here.Updated at 11:25 a.m. ET on July 20, 2023Three years ago, while the nation’s attention was on the 2020 presidential election, voters in Oregon took a dramatic step back from America’s long-running War on Drugs. By a 17-point margin, Oregonians approved Ballot Measure 110, which eliminated criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of any drug, including cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. When the policy went into effect early the next year, it lifted the fear of prosecution for the state’s drug users and launched Oregon on an experiment to determine whether a long-sought goal of the drug-policy reform movement—decriminalization—could help solve America’s drug problems.Early results of this reform effort, the first of its kind in any state, are now coming into view, and so far, they are not encouraging. State leaders have acknowledged faults with the policy’s implementation and enforcement measures. And Oregon’s drug problems have not improved. Last year, the state experienced one of the sharpest rises in overdose deaths in the nation and had one of the highest percentages of adults with a substance-use disorder. During one two-week period last month, three children under the age of 4 overdosed in Portland after ingesting fentanyl.TO READ THE FULL STORY, START YOUR FREE TRIAL TODAY.NEVER MISS A STORY.

It is an unfortunate side effect of what I can only describe as the infantilisation of society that I have watched happen over the last few decades.It will likely result in people reaching for a paternal “strongman” figure and a subsequent slide into (probably) fascism.So long, and thanks for all the fish.replyvjk800 > Shame is an important aspect of behaviour moderation, a negative emotion usefully experienced when doing something that breaks the social contract.In places with diverse people from different backgrounds and cultures (i.e. all modern cities) there is no social contract. Apart from murdering people, there are very few things that people agree are universally good or bad, and thus the behaviour moderating effect doesn't exist either.As someone who was raised in a very small town with sort of strict culture (didn't really seem like that to me at the time, but by modern urban standards it was that), I can very easily see how the cultural relativism leads to all kinds of social problems in western urban world. In my town no-one did drugs, because that would have been shameful. People around you (all of them to some extent) are important, you are important to them and you care about what they think about you, and as a result you don't want to do stuff that will look shameful in their eyes. Without this guidance from other people, (some) people end up going down into rabbit holes of drug habit, alt right, etc.replygodelski root | I've lived in small towns and big towns. The difference is that in the big town the drug users are anonymous in that you don't know them. In the small down they are your coworker's sister's brother in law.I lived in a town of 20k people that was BY FAR the largest for an hour drive in any direction. Lots of drunks. First place I lived there, my neighbor was selling meth, put up a confederate flag in their window when a black lady moved into my duplex, and was shot 6 times later than year (survived, since we was shot by a shaky meth head who used a 22). They were banned from the place and police wouldn't do shit whenever they were back and they got mad at me when I demanded they take care of the screaming meth head at 6am on a Saturday. They stole parts off my truck. There were meth heads climbing their fence all hours and days. I literally watched a different neighbor get arrested by a cop who said \"hey, don't we have a warrant for you?\" (neo nazi guy, who just turned around and the cuffed him). When I moved later that year? Heard nothing. Wouldn't have known. Only thing was you'd still see grown men riding children's bikes because you know they lost their license. No one rode bikes there. Shit was dangerous as hell.I went to college in a non-college town about twice that size (college wasCompared with rural counties, urban counties had higher drug overdose death rates in 23 states and lower rates in 8 states in 2020.https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db440.htmNot exclusive to urban areas but it happens more there.replythrowaway77384 root | > In my town no-one did drugs, because that would have been shameful.Reads: People hid their drug use successfully. How much history do we need to experience before we accept that shame only leads to everyone pretending that something isn't a problem instead of addressing it head on.replyvjk800 root | \"No-one\" was a bit of a hyperbola; there was a known \"drug gang\" of three people who we were warned not to interact with when we were children. These three drug users were known by everyone and I'd really be surprised if there were significantly more people using any kind of illegal substances; back in the 90s it was just not that easy to hide stuff in a town of 3000 people. Also, where the hell would you even get drugs? From the three people drug gang (who presumably were buying their stuff from a bigger city 50 kilometers away)? In that case you would be seen to interact with them, which would immediately raise some doubts.I suppose it's possible that there were some other people besides this three people gang at least trying illegal substances, but it was still marginal enough to been a complete non-problem. Alcohol, however, was different; it was legal and socially accepted and many people had a problem with it.replygodelski root | It sounds like you're suggesting they were selling. Which if so clearly people were using. Back in the 90's it was easy to hide shit. Especially small towns. It's not like you're all living on one block. Sounds like rural area and that's a lotta land.> Alcohol... many people had a problem with it.I think this disproves your entire point. We both know that problematic drinking isn't socially acceptable in those small towns. Especially with the religiousness. So probably a different factor that you're conflating.replyPakistaniDenzel root | > Reads: People hid their drug use successfully.Reads: Someone who can't comprehend that a lot of people actually don't want to do drugs.replypantalaimon root | Not sure how it’s in the US, but in the small village where I came from (and that fits OPs description) alcoholism was rampantreplykajaktum root | I mean if everyone did drugs but everyone never noticed it then, did they actually use drugs? If there's nothing observable from someone that is supposedly drunk, then who cares?replyTulliusCicero root | Is drug abuse actually more common in more diverse and larger cities?replyjavajosh It presents an interesting problem for those \"left behind\" who value shame, self-restraint, and other unpopular virtues. The neoliberal view is that you can prove your point by forming subcultures that do better than the surrounding culture. I think that's true, but it's a plan B - plan A should be to fight hard to not lose those values in the first place.It's appalling that public discourse about systemic issues has entirely displaced talk of personal responsibility. It's appalling that a positive openness to alternative lifestyles has extended to an absurd dropping of ALL standards. Talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater!Sean Carroll has a recent podcast episode descrying the \"crisis in physics\", which he (partially) articulates as a problem of perception. As much as he himself always wanted to be a science heretic, he notes that all previous successful heretics were experts in the established state-of-the-art, and now if a member of the public researches physics, ALL they hear from are \"heretics\" who don't know the first thing about established physics. It's like the act of rebellion itself has eclipsed the utility of the specific act.replydavidmnoll root | If you’re talking about public policy, IMO personal moral opinions have no place. Do you really want the state teaching “personal responsibility”? Even if you did, do you really think they could do it effectively? We have the highest prison population per capita as it is. It’s been tried. Over and over.Using the idea that millions of people are just morally deficient as public policy is a proven failure. There’s always a reason when millions of people are doing the “wrong” thing, and the job of public policy is to assess the return on investment to society of removing those reasons or otherwise disincentivizing the behavior.Personal responsibility is a personal lesson that requires personal choices and experiences. It’s not something you can publicly mandatereplyjohnnyanmac 8 root | >Do you really want the state teaching “personal responsibility”?but they do. All those \"eat healthy\", \"don't do drugs\", \"play outside 2 hours a day\"? They were all funded by some government if they were displaying in public schools. It's not the only nor even primary pillar, but it is a big one.And of course I don't need to specify how they indirectly teach/punish personal responsibilities with subsidies. Slashing the subsidies on corn would cause more radical changes than any sort of propganda they show on ads.replypugets root | I don't think the aim is to teach that \"millions of people are just morally deficient,\" as you put it. Rather, the aim should be to reinforce that everyone has the capacity to do good or bad, and the direction of your life is influenced partially (if not majorly) by the average value of your decisions.In some aspects of our culture, shame still exists to great effect. For example, drunk driving is a behavior that never gets a pardon. Words never spoken: \"We shouldn't judge Joe for his DUI, for if we were in his shoes, we may have done the same.\"The drunk driver may deserve all sorts of considerations: They struggled with alcoholism, their judgment was impaired at the time, they needed to go to work in the morning, they couldn't afford an Uber, their designated driver didn't show, they didn't speak English well enough to coordinate another ride home. In function, no excuses are allowed. As a culture, we believe that no matter your situation, you must always make plans to avoid driving drunk.What if this same type of intense shame existed towards other behaviors we wished to not see? To name one: What if we intensely shamed parents who let their young children become obese? Instead of blaming food deserts, lack of nutritional knowledge, lack of time to prepare meals, and so on, what if the blame went directly to the parents who are letting their elementary age children graze on a party sized bag of Doritos?replyvasco root | Or my personal favorite application of shame at a societal level: shaming people for dodging taxes.replyjavajosh root | Things are only illegal because we agree to make them illegal, and for no other reason. Same for \"norms\": the rules that are not enforced by a court, but by the \"stink eye\" of your peers. In each of these realms each individual is defendant, prosecutor and judge. It's complicated and confusing, and I'm sorry. But that's how it is.But what it is NOT is the state teaching personal responsibility. That's...stupid. I feel like I'm supposed to come up with more analysis, but it would just be a euphamism, or a post hoc rationalization, of the fact that I find the attitude stupid. Low intelligence. Dumb. And moreover I find myself so angry at a family of rhetorical jabs that get replicated over and over again by the weak minded that find some success with them against even weaker foes. But in the end your mischaracterization of society itself for some sort of short-term social benefit will only result in loss. For you, for me, and for the very system that taught you enough language and logic to deploy the weapon.Shame on you!(It occurs to me that an honest expression of contempt is out of fashion. But fuck it. Fuck fashion.)reply1024core root | > We have the highest prison population per capita as it is. It’s been tried. Over and over.You are conflating a flawed justice system (prison) with teaching morality. They are not the same.replywebnrrd2k root | I don't read the parent as conflating a flawed justice system with teaching morality.I read it as using the failure of the justice system as an example of his larger point: Personal responsibility is a personal lesson that requires personal choices and experiences. It’s not something you can publicly mandate.The justice system was one example of a failed attempt to publically mandate morality.replynonethewiser root | It can’t really come from public policy by definition. Public policy would look different in a world where people expect personal responsibility. But it cannot be mandated by the state. Its a value.replyttctciyf root | Carroll's episode is worth listening to, not least for it's exceptionally clear exposition of the current physics consensus around QM, qft, standard model, etc., and how they are related, but the point you specifically mention is a weak spot for me.For one thing he hardly mentions the epic failure of string theory to make good on its initial promises nor the murky waters of anthropic claims and metaphysical notions of beauty, etc., used to keep it suspended like Wile E Coyote after running off the cliff of empirical support.As non-crackpot physics profs and postgrads (e.g. [1], [2]) have pointed out, this has not engendered public trust and is a key ingredient in whatever \"crisis\" the discipline is undergoing.Not that Carroll doesn't make plenty of good arguments to support his views, but his seeming equation of any criticism of the field with crackpotist heresies is a cheap trick for a philosophy prof.1: https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?cat=82: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kya_LXa_y1Ereplynonethewiser root | > It's appalling that public discourse about systemic issues has entirely displaced talk of personal responsibility.Well, many don’t believe in personal responsibility. Some argue individuals are inextricably bound by the shortcomings of society and society must account for that.Its kind of a self fulfilling prophecy.replycal85 root | > The neoliberal view is that you can prove your point by forming subcultures that do better than the surrounding culture.Can you clarify who you actually mean here by neoliberalism? It seems a very loosely defined ideology. Do you just mean ‘the mainstream West’, or something more specific? It’s a strange -ism. It’s very vague in definition, and no one ever professes to be a member of it, yet it is ostensibly an ideology.

Perhaps not exactly the same but it makes me think about how many Atheists read the bible like fundamentalists.> For instance, Corey has fun rebutting an atheist who accuses a “devout” Christian girl of hypocrisy for having tattoos, because those are supposedly forbidden by the Bible—if you read the Bible like a fundamentalist. As a Christian myself, I’ve been accused by atheists of inconsistency for holding that neither Christians nor theists in general need believe that God created the universe in literally six 24-hour periods, somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. It’s as if I can’t be a creationist at all without being what’s called a young-earth creationist. That would be news to St. Augustine as well as to many respectable contemporary Christian thinkershttps://intellectualtakeout.org/2017/08/why-atheists-read-th...In this case, you have someone who disagrees with an ideaology insisting on what the ideology is, in spite of many genuine believers espousing less extreme ideas.replybratbag root | \"I'm not a fundamentalist just a hypocrite who picks and chooses which truths are fundamental to suit my own agenda\"is not the strong argument you might think it is.replyjavajosh root | Well, I don't mean it pejoratively. It harnesses the ideas of mutation + selection which has been proven to be successful for 5 billion years. \"Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler,\" describes the limits of practical reason. People have a great deal of latent evil within them, and society should be the least oppressive it can be, but not less oppressive.replykaashif root | > no one ever professes to be a member of itGo to reddit.com/r/neoliberal, there are lots of people claiming to be neoliberals there.replyezekiel68 root | You're not wrong about displacing talk of personal responsibility.

I guess its metaphorically connected if you interpret it as a market of subcultures, but that's a pretty strained metaphor, not a real connection to the ideology.> It's appalling that public discourse about systemic issues has entirely displaced talk of personal responsibility. It's appalling that a positive openness to alternative lifestyles has extended to an absurd dropping of ALL standards.Its apalling that public discourse has seen grounded criticism and fact-based debate replaced with ludicrous strawmen and hyperbole in which any connection to reality is so distant and minute as to be undetectable like this.replyzmgsabst root | I think it speaks to the incoherence of their views they don’t consider culture, including teaching personal regulation and responsibility, as a feature of systemic problems.How can culture not be an aspect of a social creature’s systemics?replyHWR_14 It's difficult for me to overstate how much I disagree with you.I don't need more people being shamed for being gay, for wearing the wrong outfit or for not fitting in. Shame just doesn't work well at a practical level. To say nothing of the superpower that gives the shameless.Meanwhile, I find your alternative of \"well if we don't have shame, we'll just have to make explicit laws about it\" to be not a bad thing at all. You called it fascism with no real reasoning. Explicit laws that we can change and discuss seems like a good way to manage things!replynonethewiser root | > It's difficult for me to overstate how much I disagree with you.> I don't need more people being shamed for being gayWell he never said anything about being gay. Perhaps you’re reading some other concerns into his comment.Imagine two worlds where there is no murder. The first has no murder because no one feels inclined to murder. The second has no murder because there are very strong rules which stop people who feel inclined to do it. Can there possibly be any case made to choose the 2nd over the 1st?Japan is a good example of this principle. Things are a lot more orderly despite a lot weaker enforcement mechanisms.replygodelski root | This is a terrible example. Most people do not want to murder, even when very angry. You don't need laws to make people not murder. The laws are for what to do when people do. No matter how universal an attribute is it'll never be 100%. Besides, you'll notice the murder rate is highly localized and associated with economic opportunities.You know why talking about gay people _is_ a good example? Because you probably forgot that not even 10 years ago gay marriage wasn't legal in the US, or most of the world. In fact, only 10 countries did. 10. You probably forgot how heated that topic was. How people would try to shame two men for holding hands in public. We're not talking about some super flamboyant guy like that Key & Peele skit, but the other side of that. I mean just ask any Catholic how well shame works. Cultures change fast. Far faster than just the old people dying. But you don't get to be selective about what should be shameful or not. Times change and what was shameful in the past is considered fine now. In fact objecting to some things, such as gay marriage, have now reversed. Shame isn't defined objectively, just like our morals. So the argument doesn't work without this condition.Speaking of Japan, you know where gay marriage is illegal? Japan. Just June the courts ruled that the ban is constitutional (but other courts have said it isn't). Which just became legal in Korea this year. Didn't even recognize the marriages of foreign diplomats till 2019. In fact, there are only two countries in Asia that have gay marriage: South Korea and Taiwan (2019 but not full rights till 2023). You can probably ask these people about how good shame is too.You're going to need some strong evidence to convince me that Japan's low murder rate is because of its laws.replytaxyz root | You’re either too young to remember or creating a non-existent history of what life was like before same-sex marriage was legalized. This is not a comment on anything to do with gay rights but more just a matter of fact: pre-Obergefell life was VERY similar to life today. Gay people still lived together, still went on dates, and held hands. They weren’t run out of town for being gay. There wasn’t rampant homophobia everywhere you turned and anti-gay gangs roaming about enforcing the social order. They just couldn’t enjoy the legal benefits of marriage.If anything, things are probably worse from a sentiment perspective for gay people now because a bunch of heterosexual liberal white women use pride parades to act completely shamelessly under the guise of being warriors for a movement they aren’t otherwise a part of.replyfennecfoxy root | Except even now I still get harassed for holding a guy's hand. I still look over my shoulder.Because people will give you disgusted looks when lots of other people are around, maybe they'll be brave enough to attack you. But when it's just them and their mates around, they _will_ attack you.replymptest root | Wow! They could still hold hands in public. Who cares if they weren't afforded the same legal and financial rights, they could go on dates! Pretty crazy comment man or maybe I'm naive as a straight dude.replydarthrupert root | Most people do want to murder when very angry, at least for the definition of very angry that I'm familiar with. The problem is that our societies drive more and more people to be very angry.replyblackoil root | It doesn't work selectively, if society can shame you into not taking drugs it will do so everything else non-confirming.In my society not valuing individual freedom girls have/had been shamed into not wearing jeans/skirts, going out for night movie show or even cutting hairs.replynonethewiser root | First, you are conflating being ashamed with people shaming them thers.Second, it doesnt follow that shaming 1 thing means shaming everything. And surely you can recognize that there exist some things that people should be ashamed of?replytehbeard root | And surely you can recognise that others can have a very different view of what's shameful, that's at odds with your own rosey view of it as a tool against self destructive behaviour?Various religions and political groups have used and continue to use shame against the lgbt community, using monikers like sinful or perverse to shame them for who they are by grading them against some flawed ideal that they themselves often fail to attain.replycat_plus_plus root | It doesn't work selectively, if society can shame you into not posting homophobic tweets, they will do so with everything else non-conforming?replydenkmoon root | Please head over to X and observe the homophobic tweets.replycat_plus_plus root | Are you fine with both these tweets and people smoking fentanyl in public, or can social pressure do some good in both cases?replyp91paul root | In your society girls go around in underwear? nice!Sorry, I really had to :)replyffhhttt root | Maybe they are permanently stuck in the 80s and only allow baggy suit pants.Or I guess… it’s probably a bit darker and they are not talking about a western country.replymakeitdouble root | The 2nd has more people diversity than the 1st.You'd think no one wanting to murder you is the best state, but practically people will have strong feelings about a lot of things in life, and it's hard to imagine a healthy society where \"that would look bad on me\" is enough to restrain you from your deepest anger moments. Having no immediate way to murder you + an active police to protect you should be the barrier to avoid a tragedy.Japan is no exception. People get murdered everyday, but there is a lot of prevention and arrangement to limit the impact of a single individual going berserk. Police patrol will catch you walking down an empty street at 3 AM with a kitchen knife in hand.replynonethewiser root | > The 2nd has more people diversity than the 1st.Is this a coy way of saying not all diversity is good? Sure you have more would-be-murderers but obviously Id take a less diverse group if thats the diversity.My point with Japan was not about murders. They have laws against murder. Even still, the prevention mechanisms are weaker. Less lethal equipment and training, not positioned in schools, etc.It was more about social expectations that are not enforced but are more strictly followed than in the west because of a sort of shame.The point is not even that more social shaming is strictly better, just that it’s certainly a stronger guide rail on behavior than rules that people otherwise sont care about.replymakeitdouble root | This is a point that feels difficult to make, but yes, to my eyes more diversity is better, even at the cost of slightly more social chaos and a rougher social landscape (with some balance).In a way I think Japan is paying that price in that it has a harder time to adapt to change and is slower to adapt new ideas. Japanese people are inventive and come up with a lot of good ideas, but society's homogeneity and stability means the hurdle to get any idea past the critical point is that much higher. Cash is still the only payment method allowed in a ton of commerce for instance, when Japan actually has so much advance regarding electronic payment variety and barrier to use.On would-be-murderers, I am supposing they're not just different in their murdering intents, but also have different ideas, views of the world, and can deal with some situations better than the more obedient people. I'd see it as the best of both world if we could let them bring new ideas and try different things, while keeping active systems and arrangements preventing them from going to the dark side.I wonder if Canada for instance is succeeding in this balancing act. I don't hate Japan as it currently is, but I think it stagnated way too long and it's becoming a bigger and bigger issue.replyffhhttt root | > Police patrol will catch you walking down an empty street at 3 AM with a kitchen knife in hand.That’s really not the (main or significant) reason why Japan has a low murder rate.Many European countries where there is little societal pressure, direct control and enforcement, drug use is fairly widespread and low level crime is rampant in large urban centers (compared to Japan of course) have comparable murder rates.In this regard US is a huge outlier compared to pretty much all other “first world” countries.replygodelski root | > it's hard to imagine a healthy society where \"that would look bad on me\" is enough to restrain you from your deepest anger moments.Really shame and accountability only work at small scale. Which should be rather obvious given that you like your friends and will associate with family members who you highly disagree with on fundamental issues, but you wouldn't have a tenth of the patience for some rando at a bar who's even closer to your opinions than those people.As for laws and prevention, we have thousands of years of evidence for systems that don't work. Murders are even rather high in places with exceedingly draconian laws around them and weapons. Maybe, just maybe, it isn't the core reason that people don't murder. Maybe, just maybe, it has to do with something else. I mean it isn't like we give women stronger punishments when they murder and that's why they murder at nearly an magnitude lower of a rate than men.replyforgingahead root | Japan is highly homogenous - their immigration policy would be decried by many liberals in the West as \"racist\". It is a massive factor in how their society is run, and why they are so high-trust that they don't need strong enforcement mechanisms (in some cases. Don't be a Western car exec there for example).There is a show on Netflix called \"Old Enough!\". It's worth watching to see how some of the high-trust works in practice, and also to perhaps think through if we could be comfortable with the same in our own neighbourhoods and countries. My guess for most people in the Anglo West, the answer would be \"No\".replyharryVic root | Singapore is incredibly diverse and doesn't have any drug problems due to tough laws.replyffhhttt root | It’s also a tiny country which happens to be a dictatorship where these drug laws are fairly easy to enforce.Also I’m not convinced that executing people for non-violent crimes is a good tradeoff in the first place.replyNursie root | Some (many?) would say their drug laws and other harsh punishments are a problem in themselves.replyforgingahead root | That's exactly my point. In high-trust, homogenous societies, you don't necessarily need harsh laws to enforce social norms and \"civilised\" behaviour. In more heterogenous societies, you have low-trust so you need tough laws to enforce the societal \"norms\".Japan is the former and Singapore is the latter. Both end up in good places to live, but one has to have the full discussion about the reasons and causes for each.replyBarrin92 root | Have you lived in Japan? Because this is an almost stereotypical outsider view of the country. Japan has draconian drug laws, up to 10 years for minor possession. People can be held in detention, repeatedly, for weeks without being formally accused. Police is visibly present in public.All of East Asia is homogeneous. Every country is highly paternalistic and legalistic. North Korea is probably both the most homogeneous and authoritarian country on earth.In reality heterogeneous societies are significantly less prone to this. You could not turn India or the US into comparable police states because nobody would even agree on how to get there. Singapore gets away with it because it's effectively a small city state. A country of similar composition but 10x larger, which happens to actually exist just North, Malaysia, could never maintain that level of repression.replyzztop44 root | Why would Japan’s immigration policy be decried as racist? Just because the low raw numbers of total immigrants and (especially) refugees? Or is there something else?replypfannkuchen root | Are other Asians, like Koreans or Taiwanese, allowed to immigrate to Japan? I thought just no one was allowed to immigrate easily, and that they basically have no immigration as a result. Is there a specific prohibition based on race?replyskissane root | > and that they basically have no immigration as a resultI don't know where this idea that \"Japan has no immigration\" comes from – it isn't true.According to OECD statistics, in 2019 Japan (population 125 million) had net permanent immigration of 137,824 people. Compare that to fellow OECD member Mexico, with almost the same population, which in 2019 only had net permanent immigration of 38,704. [0]In 2019, Japan's population was 2.2% foreign nationals. [1] While that is at the low end by OECD standards, it is still ahead of Hungary (1.9%), Lithuania (1.7%), Slovakia (1.4%), Turkey (1.1%), Poland (0.6%) and Mexico (0.4%).According to MIPEX [2], the ease of gaining permanent residence in Japan is on par with the US and New Zealand, modestly easier than France and the UK, significantly easier than Switzerland or Australia. The worst country was Saudi Arabia, with UAE not far behind; equal first in ease were Brazil and Finland, with Sweden, Mexico and Ukraine equal second, and Hungary and South Africa equal third.[0] https://data.oecd.org/migration/permanent-immigrant-inflows....[1] https://data.oecd.org/migration/foreign-population.htm[2] https://www.mipex.eu/permanent-residencereplygoodpoint root | It's indeed racist and not not \"racist\".replybabyshake root | > I don't need more people being shamed for being gay, for wearing the wrong outfit or for not fitting in.This is a strawman argument. I think what we're talking about is shame for having a reckless disregard for others. The way I think of it is we are increasingly living in a world where people are viewing other humans as \"NPCs\".replykenjackson root | Is it a strawman? Isn’t that why we had the whole notion of being in the closet, to avoid shame to yourself and family?I get it — let’s have shame for the things that “we” want there to be shame about. I just don’t think there is good consensus on what that is.replyrayiner root | You’re overlooking the economic context in which that social norm arose in subsistence agriculture societies. In the third-world village where my dad grew up, survival required getting married and having a couple of kids to make ends meet on the farm. The under-5 mortality rate was 1 in 5 so the adoption market was virtually non-existent. And there was little surplus generated by the village that could be used to support childless couples doing non-agricultural work. That was the reality of human history from the advent of agriculture until the 20th century (and in many parts of Africa and Asia, that’s still the reality).So what function did shame serve in that society?replynonethewiser root | We dont need to all agree on what is shameful before agreeing that shamefulness exists. Sure there are differences of opinion but perhaps the worst conclusion to draw is that we shouldnt tolerate shame of anything because we fear shame of 1 specific thing.replykenjackson root | Honestly I think this whole argument is wrong on its head. The issue is that those strung out on these drugs have no shame regardless of any social norms beyond it. Almost no one I know wants to be on meth. And those I know who are on meth don’t care what you think about most things. This whole discussion about shame plays little role for them.replylodovic root | The discussion is about taking hard drugs and being ashamed of that, not about coming out of the closet. Stop changing the subject.replyvmladenov root | No subject is being changed. The assertion introduced in the root comment is about the effectiveness of public shaming as a means to sustain social order. There are many good replies arguing against that notion.It is also the peak of naïveté to assume any mechanism of social control will remain restricted to our pet favorite cause. Isn’t that what every discussion here about encryption backdooors ends up concluding?replyrayiner root | What do you mean shame doesn’t work? America is a country that literally can’t reproduce itself without importing people from countries where mothers shame children for not having children in a timely manner. America had 100,000 people die of drug overdoses last year, whereas societies that shame people for drug use have far lower rates of overdoses. Middle eastern and south Asian countries that shame people for pre-marital sex largely managed to avoid the AIDS epidemic that gripped similarly poor countries in other regions.And let’s not forget that we live in a country that became a world power under a social structure that was much more rigid and repressive than the one we have today. Our relative decline in economic importance is probably caused by other economic trends, but it’s pretty wild to say “shame doesn’t work” despite the evidence to the contrary.replytoofy root | > Middle eastern and south Asian countries that shame people for pre-marital sex largely managed to avoid the AIDS epidemicthis is absurd, there are plenty of countries who have high levels of shame where aids is still running rampant. and to even imply that we (the us) didn’t have high levels of pre-marital sex in “the good old days when we could shame people” is naive to an extreme.> let’s not forget that we live in a country that became a world power under a social structure that was much more rigid and repressive than the one we have today.if you’re suggesting that i should intentionally live under rigid repression to “be a world power” i say nah, thanks tho. i’d rather we were a middling country where people are free and not living under some authoritarian religious kooks or whatever power would be repressing me “for my own good” because they have deluded themselves that they “know better than we do” what will make us happy.replyhappymellon root | > Middle eastern and south Asian countries that shame people for pre-marital sex largely managed to avoid the AIDS epidemic that gripped similarly poor countries in other regions.Are you serious?Pre-marital rape is a massive issue there, as is underage rape, and rape \"to just teach those women a lesson\".replypfannkuchen root | I think they take a different approach though, where women are guarded by the family from being in situations where males, who are known and accepted to be violently sexually aggressive, might harm them. Then women who end up in such situations anyway are considered fair game, more or less.I imagine, though, that while the numbers for various rape types are probably relatively high compared to other countries, those crimes still affect a tiny minority of women and wouldn’t move the broader needle on HIV rates. I would guess that date rape is also extremely lower than in the west due to courtship practices being very different (which would work against high HIV rates).replyffhhttt root | > let’s not forget that we live in a country that became a world power under a social structure that was much more rigid and repressive than the one we have today.Was it significantly more rigid and repressive than in other countries at the time?

I can’t really think of any…> And let’s not forget that we live in a country that became a world power under a social structure that was much more rigid and repressive than the one we have todayGreat point, it’s interesting how eager people are to perform large scale social experiments in rapid succession and with no roll back button.replyselimthegrim root | If you think AIDS isn’t a problem in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, I have a bridge to sell you.replygraeme root | This was in the comment you’re replying to.

Similar but far from identical.replyrewmie root | > As the other comment said, you’re also discussing “being shamed” whereas the original comment is about “feeling shame”. Similar but far from identical.No, not really. OP clearly advocates for \"the need of an authority figure\" to force his personal views onto others he feels are lacking in the way of morals. OP's puerile take on \"shame\" is just a thinly veilled desire to oppress everyone and anyone around them that does not comply with his personal views.replygrncdr root | The OP actually said something nearly opposite to that…> Without shame, many people unfortunately need an authority figure to step in and moderate their behaviour.This is an argument against relying on authority figures to replace the role of shame and implicit social contract. I honestly don’t know how they could have made that more clear than when they continued with this:> It will likely result in people reaching for a paternal “strongman” figure and a subsequent slide into (probably) fascism.Again, the argument is that _without_ shame and a shared social contract, the replacement by explicit state authority to moderate harmful behaviors drifts towards fascism.replygoodpoint root | > Again, the argument is that _without_ shame and a shared social contract, the replacement by explicit state authority to moderate harmful behaviors drifts towards fascism.The argument is plain wrong. Fascism and nazism were driven by fear and shame from day one.

I so hate it when people use \"gay\" to invoke some sort of a culture war side-choosing spell. The original comment is about feeling shame not being shamed. If you believe being gay is wrong the yes you should feel shame, if you don't then the question is not relevant for you.The original commenter is more right than any of us can conceive. So many societal problems would be solved if people had raised their kids to learn to feel shame. Trumpism, gun worship, climate change denial, post-truth mindset, anti-vaxx, treason, insurrection, racial hatred and discrimination,etc... the thing so many of people with these views have in a common is they feel no shame about the harm they are causing.If in your own opinion you did something wrong, you should absolutley feel shame. What is more evil than being proud of doing wrong by your own standards? You can debate what is right ir wrong or even what morality is but refusing to feel shame is embracing evil.replysaulpw root | That's the thing about shame, it's NOT your own standards, it's society's (your parents') standards that have been inculcated into you since before you were born. I remember a post by a guy on reddit who was waiting for his g/f in a gas station and tried on some sunglasses on the rack before he realized they were women's sunglasses. and he felt such an immense shock of shame that he almost threw them on the floor. He realized how ridiculous this was (hence the post) but it doesn't matter, that shame runs really deep and takes a long time and a huge personal effort to truly overcome. This is why people have had such a hard time coming to terms with being gay, and that leaks out in all kinds of terrible ways.If society only used shame for truly reprehensible, amoral, antisocial behavior, then sure, the original commenter is making a great point. But shame has been weaponized. Look around you. People are being shamed for being poor, fat, disabled, lazy, oversexed, undersexed, voting wrong, not voting, you name it. So some of us live in a state of constant shame for innocuous behavior and others of us cope by becoming shameless. Even here, you're trying to cast shame upon the shameless, with \"refusing to feel shame is embracing evil\".replynonethewiser root | OK, now do pooping on a sidewalkreplywoodruffw root | I don’t think conflating mental unwellness (which can imply an inability to feel shame) with an absence of shame in otherwise mentally well people does any particular justice to the situation.Mentally well people don’t defecate on streets, at least not under anything less than extreme privation. Those experiencing that privation likely already feel ample shame over it.replynonethewiser root | People without shame are mentally unwell.replyrewmie root | > People without shame are mentally unwell.Ok I'll bite.How do you expect to treat mental illness through shaming?replycat_plus_plus root | Easy. There are days where I feel like staying home and drinking beer / eating junk food / playing computer games. It's only because I know that's not the right thing to do that I instead go to work and do something productive, hit the gym, help kids with homework and so on. Now granted, people can come to a stage where shame is not enough to keep them going and they need medicines, therapy and so on. But for someone lacking a moral compass in the first place, none of these things are going to work. We are biologically programmed to seek easy dopamine hits. It takes knowing that it's wrong to smoke fentanyl and get high to make use of available addiction treatment.replyvasco root | That's not what they said, this has to be a bad faith interpretation. Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) for example has lack of shame as one of its defining traits.replybadrabbit root | HN throttles me, so for other commenters I can't engage in a discussion with you but hope you see this.You are conflating guilt and shame. You should feel shame when you do wrong just as much you should feel pain when your body is harmed. I have no desire to debate specifics of morality and get off topic, but if your guilt is correct then your shame is always correct.A person who does not accept their guilt cannot feel shame.It isn't society pressuring you to feel guilt, it is society pressuring you to use a specific way to measure right and wrong. You can reject that way and talk about other ways by using logic and reason. But ultimately, it is impossible to not have a means of determining right and wrong even that is only \"unprovoked physical harm to others\" unless you are a complete sociopath. And if you do have such a system, you should feel guilt when you violate that system.You have a choice when encountering guilt, to justify your actions or find excuses or to feel shame. A healthy mindser in my opinion would not be imprisoned by shame but empowered by it to self-correct and make amends. That way, you can be at peace with yourself and others.replysaulpw root | Guilt is about behavior, shame is about being (self). So you feel guilty over something you've done, and you feel shame over it being who you are.I agree with your statement that \"guilt is society pressuring you to use a specific way to measure right and wrong\", and shame is similarly the internal effect of society's pressures to measure your very being against that same code of morality.But whether society is pushing your emotional buttons from the inside or the outside doesn't matter. In the end, I know I have felt deep shame for being something completely harmless and acting accordingly. I've spent years working to overcome this, and I will say in no uncertain terms that this is not justification or excuses, but a definitively healthier mindset--and my therapist and partner and community would agree. And if you would say that it would have been healthier to use my shame to instead alter my behavior and/or self (if that latter would even be possible), I would tell you and all the homophobes and Pauline Christians to go straight to hell.I actually think you're right, that guilt/shame can be huge opportunity to evaluate your actions and your habits and your self, and to ignore it completely is to become the amoral shameless sociopath that you're decrying. But it needs to be a balanced and holistic examination, which unfortunately is not possible from a position of feeling such shame. This is the value of having someone, a therapist perhaps, to hold space for you to examine your true values, detached from the electric shock of shame. Then you can decide with your whole being whether to ignore the shame and become inured to it, or to accept that it accurately reflects your values and \"self-correct\" as you say.This way is how you can be at peace with yourself and others.replyHWR_14 root | For someone who leans hard into moral relativism, and specifically calls out moral relativism as the right way to consider shame, you have a very long list of things that shame will solve. What about the trump supporting gun worshiping climate change deniers who don't feel they are wrong? Is \"the question not relevant to [them]\"?Meanwhile, I used \"gay\" as an example because a lot of gay people feel shame about it and it's very bad for those people. It's an example of something with shame attached that clearly shouldn't.replybadrabbit root | If we can agree that you should feel shame when you do wrong the reasoning with people (and ourselves) about what is wrong and why can have an effect. Right now, because the lack of shame, all sorts if mental gymnastics and alternate realities are fabricated by people for appearances sake.> it's very bad for those peopleI don't get it, are you saying shame is bad for gay people because their guilt is justified? I have to disagree with that, you can talk about the guilt that precedes shame but shame in itself is a corrective tool.replysunderw root | You are saying> the thing so many of people with these views have in a common is they feel no shame about the harm they are causing.> If in your own opinion you did something wrong, you should absolutley feel shameIt implies that the list of people you don't like think they did something wrong but refuse to feel shame about it.To me, all those people are not shameless - in the sense that they don't feel shame _at all_ -, but don't feel shame because they don't feel like they did something wrong (how can you think you're wrong when you don't _believe_ in climate change ?).So shame in itself is not the problem.replyhattmall root | But why do you think people would / should feel shame with the things you listed just because you don't agree with them? I feel like most of what you listed is the type of people that do feel shame and actually incorporate that into their positions.replypkdpic root | I like the distinction between being shamed and feeling shamed. And although as a home owner in a northern california downtown area I couldn't agree more that shame feels absent in a lot of the behavior plaguing our communities in a multitude of capacities, Im reminded of the rumors I hear about how dysfunctional shame-grounded societies like Japan are for those who don't fit into normalized parameters.Anyway its making me wonder, has the US ever been strongly rooted in shame as a non-homogeneous nation? If so when and why did we stop?

Trumpism, gun worship, climate change denial, post-truth mindset, anti-vaxx, treason, insurrection, racial hatred and discrimination,etc...As you say, shame works very well. I'm baffled as to why you would assume that people who hold beliefs different from your own would raise their children without leaning upon the very effective \"shaming\" mechanism.I'm also baffled as to why you would think that anyone would be ashamed of their beliefs when they were raised to believe those things. It appears that the left side of your argument isn't aware of what the right side just said.Edit: In conclusion, your argument does not hold water. It assumes that your opponents do not think deeply upon contentious matters, and only you and yours do (and so, by your account, anyone who shares your beliefs should never feel shame, because they are simply correct). You are dismissing the beliefs of your opponents without bothering to look into the nuance of any single individual's personal stance, and instead painting half our population as extremists. You label all Republicans as \"Trumpists\" because they didn't vote for Biden. Give me a fucking break. Even the \"Bidenists\" aren't happy with Biden.You are the one who should be ashamed, but you know all about that, right? Maybe you should take a break from trying to save everyone else, and talk to a therapist about your savior complex. You might discover that you need some saving yourself.replynonethewiser root | Add sexual degeneracy to the listSomeone please explain to me how sexual degeneracy doesn’t exist.

Where “crime” is something other than the drug use/possession.This individual has always been self absorbed and useless. His daughter asked him to change for her, he wouldn’t. His daughter’s counselor basically told her to decide how to remember him, it’s unlikely he will make it a year.Personally, I feel the individual is a PoS and hope he suffers but it’s heart wrenching to see the affect it’s having on his daughter.Addition: this is happening in one of the more permissive and “progressive” communities in CA.replypierat root | What's the saying... \"My body, My choice\" ?Well, some people will choose, willingly, to waste their life away living on the streets from one high to the next.

Here's one of the downsides.If they wanted to 'get out', I'd be there to help them if I knew them. But they have to want to. Forcing your viewpoint on them makes you just as a horrible person as the judges throwing people in locked boxes for decades for a bit of white powder they injected.replywk_end root | The problem of course is that it's not strictly about one's own body, in this case. \"Bodily autonomy\" doesn't cover the petty crimes addicts often commit to get money to buy drugs - the impossibility of biking anywhere knowing your vehicle is almost guaranteed to get stolen, the economic deserts created because businesses can't operate in certain areas due to theft and safety, the property damage that needs to be paid for over and over; the cost - of shelters, food banks, etc. - of supporting those who, in the depths of their addiction, can no longer support themselves; the public spaces damaged and deprived to others by the homeless encampments that flood parks and obstruct sidewalks; the danger of used needles lying around; the trauma experienced by people who have to see dead bodies littering the streets.In an ideal world, I guess these things would all be prevented and/or prosecuted, rather than the drugs themselves, of course, so as best to preserve bodily autonomy. I think you can make the case that the Oregon experiment is showing how in practice that doesn't happen.replycronix root | It also doesn't cover the cost in terms of tying up a major resource: Paramedics, Police and Fire.Overdoses are at an all time high in Portland.

It takes it's toll mentally to respond these calls which are taking up and increasing percentage of the calls they have to respond to.https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/the-story/portland-do...The main failure of this experiment, imho, is the missing component of forcing detox/rehab/etc when x amount of drug related crimes are committed. The measure explicitly said the addict has to seek the help on their own volition.

Drug crimes and related crimes get huge penalties. No medical treatment if you have certain drugs in your system. Make it so the cost of using fentanyl is so high that there is some deterrence.replymagicalist root | > Overdoses are at an all time high in Portland.Also in many many places that aren't Portland, so not sure why that's relevant?replywaldothedog root | Guessing that the comment author lives there, and it’s the major city in the state referenced in the article?replysaurik root | But if overdoses are peaking in a lot of places outside of Oregon than pointing out that overdoses are going up quickly in Portland is being deceptive. (Note that I do not myself have any clue as to what the truth here is, but if magicalist is correct it certainly undermines this part of cronix's argument, which--whether it was intended to or not > \"I guess these things would all be prevented and/or prosecuted, rather than the drugs themselves\" I agree with this statement. Criminalizing hard drug use simply because it is associated with behaviour causing societal damage is not only inconsistent with the legality of alcohol use, it is also a slippery slope to justifying far more insidious laws. For example, a similar justification could be used to criminalize violent tv shows/movies/video games if the government believes consumption of such media is associated with societal harm.The obvious solution is to simply criminalize the acts, such as theft and property damage, that actually harm others/society, rather than indirect upstream actions such as drug use. This \"Oregon experiment\" involves far more than just decriminalizing drug use, but also (effectively) decriminalizing many other domains of crime such as retail theft, daylight robbery, urban camping, property damage, etc. not unlike what we have here in SF.replyimgabe root | You can show the bodily autonomy argument is nonsense with a simple thought experiment. What if it were someone you actually cared about? Your son or daughter, sibling, loved one? Would you say \"oh well, I guess I have to respect their bodily autonomy\". No, you'd drag them into rehab whether they wanted to go or not. Because you know that is ultimately better for them. That's what you do when you care about someone. You don't let them rot and die on the street. Clearly the folks pushing for letting people die on the street do not care about the well-being of those people.replySpivak root | You're missing influence vs force. If I care about someone I will do everyone in my power to get them into rehab but I would never force them, even if I had parental authority over them to do so. The only time in my life I have ever deprived someone of their bodily autonomy is with their consent, \"hey when I'm drunk don't let me smoke.\"replyimgabe root | That’s because you’re an individual. We imbue the government with the power to use force to protect both individuals and the general public from the negative effects of antisocial behavior like fouling up a public space so you can do drugs in a tent.replySpivak root | The \"doing drugs\" part seems basically immaterial, if they were doing those same drugs in a house I doubt would you care at all. If you want to just ban being homeless in a tent in shared public spaces then go off king, I'll vote for it. If possible I would just want there to be some actual shelter for them to go to. We somehow have the money to feed, clothe, and house a bunch of people in prison, we could make shelters of comparable sizes and amenities.replyimgabe root | The two are interconnected. If they weren't addicted to drugs, they probably wouldn't be homeless living in a tent. There's probably no scenario where you get a homeless drug addict into housing and they are able to maintain a normal lifestyle and have a job, take care of themselves, and contribute to society while still being addicted to drugs, so getting them off of drugs is going to be a necessary part of getting their life back on track.Sure, if someone is addicted to drugs but is still able to maintain a home and otherwise take care of themselves, then that's not society's problem, at least, yet. I still think they'd be better off not doing drugs, but it's not yet to the point where their problems are imposing on other people.replyseanmcdirmid root | It’s totally a selection bias: if someone is doing drugs but isn’t running around screaming half naked in the street having a fent crisis, you would hardly notice them would you? It is for the same reason that homelessness has been wrongly equivocated with drug addiction (you don’t notice the ones that aren’t shoplifting to support their habit or having a crisis on the street for one drug related reason or another).Surely there are adults and kids doing this in their homes, and we usually don’t notice them until a tragedy occurs (eg a teenager tries fent for the first time…and they are dead).replyyafbum root | I think you leave out a couple things here.Externalities: the costs of caring for the addicted are high, and the quality of life in neighborhoods where addicts congregate is horrendous, between violence, insecurity and insalubriousness. I don't think a lot of people feel comfortable raising kids in places where there's public defecation on the daily. So yes I feel somewhat entitled to force that much of a \"viewpoint\" on my fellow citizens.That addicts \"chose\" the path that they're in, I think reasonable people could disagree about it. To some folks, all behavior is the responsibility of the individual, and claiming otherwise is paternalistic overreach. Personally, I think it's fairly well established that some substances cause powerful long-term addiction in some people, well above the person's willpower. I don't care for locking up users, but I do think dealers and traffickers deserve the worst punishments for knowingly causing long-term harm to users.replyClumsyPilot root | > What's the saying... \"My body, My choice\" ?Someone needs to be of sound mind to make a choice. Clearly you can't sign life-changing legal documents, or testify in court while drunk.A range of other conditions, like deep depression, state of shock, etc. count. Does addiction?Surely a definition of addiction is that you cannot stop, i.e. its a mental condition.Like if someone ia diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, do we ask them if they want treatment? No, we have to treat then anyway.I do not think this is a slippery slope, the conditions are fairly well defibed.replyTedDoesntTalk root | > if someone is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, do we ask them if they want treatment? No, we have to treat then anyway.That is not true in all US states. One cannot be committed to a mental institution against one’s will unless ordered by a judge. And one can’t be forced to ingest antipsychotics unless committed against one’s will.

I am talking about every law that you do in fact support.Second, by support I don't mean voting or authoring or anything like that. I just mean if you are not an anarchist then you believe there should be some laws.Third, I think you know what I mean. I am not talking about any specific law, but laws in general. If you are not an anarchist then you likely support having a law against murder and rape. Both of those laws are about forcing your views onto others. This is not about any specific implementation of murder laws, but a murder law in general. Every murder law is about forcing your view that murder is bad onto others.replyseanmcdirmid root | I have no problem with people abusing drugs as long as (a) the property crime that comes with it is heavily cracked down on and (b) society isn’t on the hook to fund drug treatment. Both are libertarian viewpoints: society exists mainly to protect property rights, and my property shouldn’t be stolen to recover from someone else’s bad decisions.replyMizoguchi root | People don't necessarily choose their life circumstances. A drug addict is a disabled person, their brains soaked in chemicals inhibiting from any logical reasoning. Sometimes they may experience monetary lapses of consciousness where they can feel both physical and emotional pain. Many of them have parents, siblings and children, and may have decided to stay away from their love ones because of shame. So obviously this social experiment was absurd, you are facilitating the trade of drugs within a vulnerable community. Everyone would agree that a 10 year old kid should not have legal access to alcohol, so why we think a mentally disabled addict should be able to buy drugs? Sobering up is a monumental challenge when you are on hard drugs, you need at minimum a doctor and weekly therapies designed for your particular type of addiction and health/psychological condition, and a strong support system of relatives and friends around you almost 24/7. So expecting that an addict all by themselves voluntarily wants to \"get out\" and seek or receive help is as ridiculous as the idea of a legal market for hard drugs. Addicts need to be forced into rehab where they can receive the right treatment and eventually be reunited with their families and slowly get back on their feet. This should not be hard to do for a country like the US but no one wants to have the hard talk, so we brush the problem under the rug and call for legalization of drugs and affordable housingreplyUser23 root | Bodily autonomy isn’t a moral principle, it’s a rhetorical device. Literally every law on the books interferes with your autonomy. Trying to apply it as the former is as nonsensical as arguing when someone says “nobody goes there anymore” when some people in fact still do.replyChatGTP root | I once read a quote, I can't remember where, it might've been in a Buddhist text but it was something like: Your body does not belong to you, it's not yours to abuse. It does not belong to the ego.I never thought of it this way but it gelled with me immediately and I really think it's true, the body supports the mind which supports the concept of self. So if the self decides to trash the body, something isn't right about that contract.replyjmspring root | What bugs me most, communities like the one I am referring to will denigrate anyone pushing back about homeless Uber all agenda.

As the cops mentioned: being a dick isn't illegal, and there's no societal-level solutions to dicks, the best we can do is try to avoid them as individuals.I'm all for rehabilitation - but it has to be voluntary (and humane, probably has to be well-funded too) - that's what liberty is. Anything less is too authoritarian for my tastes.replyjyrkesh root | I'm not OP, but when someone is a repeat offender of some petty crimes, and they're assessed to be mentally ill and/or addicted to drugs, they should be given a choice: help or jail.(Ideally, jail would just _be_ help, but unfortunately that's not the case. And there's a long tail of criminals who _aren't_ mentally ill or addicts, so let's assume jail still exists.)I am a _staunch_ supporter of liberty, but I reject the notion that you can repeatedly pollute, steal, and commit violent acts on the streets without any recourse from the rest of society. And I absolutely support compassion as the first step of that recourse! Housing, counselors, harm reduction, and other treatments for addiction (esp opiate blockers) should all be on the table for people that need it.But the alternative to that choice has to be jail. Because the status quo is not cutting it, and you're not \"free\" to infringe on people, their homes, and their businesses.replyjdietrich root | America already has the highest incarceration rate in the developed world. I don't think that locking even more people up is going to help. I don't think that putting a mentally ill person in an overcrowded, underfunded jail will do anything to resolve their mental health problems. I don't see any evidence to suggest that coercing people into treatment actually treats their addiction.Being a drug addict is utterly miserable. We can all see that misery with our own eyes. I don't think we are willing to confront the much wider epidemic of misery that is driving people into addiction and perpetuating addiction.replyzencode root | I also doubt reducing incarnation will improve the situation either.

I think more people wouldn’t be so annoyed by decriminalization in Portland or other places if police would actually throw people in jail for property crimes that go along with drug decriminalization.replySpivak root | Sure, but if you wouldn't jail them for their petty crimes then I don't think it's right to force them into a mental institution or rehab either. So as long as it's only an alternative to jail I agree.replypcthrowaway root | I think forced rehabilitation is a better alternative to jail for people who are causing harm to others with their addiction (I'm not talking about, \"their family is sad\", I mean assaulting people, cutting drugs with dangerous adulterants and then selling them, or theft).I'm all for living and let live for people don't harm others, whether they're addicted to drugs or not.I think most addicts are also casualties of the drug war. If the government supplied clean drugs with very little markup from the production costs, and intervened for users who harmed others (using some combination of imprisonment, forced rehab, and counseling) I think we'd be much better off.Add to that, drugs could be both cheaper than current street prices (less motivation for things like theft), on top of being a source of revenue to fund the social programsreplyseanmcdirmid root | Drugs are really cheap right now, basically fentanyl is cheap and they just lace it into everything else to reduce costs. It is hard to imagine (a) fentanyl being even cheaper than it is and (b) that any taxation on it wouldn’t make it a magnitude more expensive than it currently is. Heck, just having real businesses distribute it rather than other addicts would increase prices significantly.replypcthrowaway root | I mean, if heroin was the same price for an equivalent dose, wouldn't people use that? I know (many? most?) addicts prefer fentanyl, but that's because it's cheaper for a better high. It's much more effective at a much smaller dose, so a kg of fentanyl smuggled in goes much further than a kg of heroin.But I don't think people actually prefer the sensation of the high, right? Like, you can do enough heroin for an equivalent sensation, you just have to do a lot more of it.So it sets up this situation where fentanyl is the easiest to smuggle in 1 billion doses, so it's the cheapest, so people prefer it, but it's actually way more dangerous because the difference between a dose that feels nice and a dose that kills you is too small to measure for most people.Yeah, maybe don't make fentanyl legal, but make heroin legal and make it price competitive with fentanyledit: and really, isn't fentanyl like $10 / dose on the street? I'm pretty sure heroin could be produced for a fraction of that if it was done legally. Sell it for $5 for an equivalent dose, people will make the switchreplypcthrowaway root | > Add to that, drugs could be both cheaper than current street pricesToo late to edit, but I forgot another massive benefit of this: Cutting out the cartels, and funding of global terrorism in general.

Heh, nope. This is the ridiculous liberal \"notion\" of \"right\", which is incoherent and absurd. The very idea of \"right\" presupposes an objective good. Harming oneself (drugs, suicide, whatever) is objectively evil. You cannot have a right to an evil thing.replytravisjungroth root | I don’t trust you, the person I’m replying to, to decide what is objectively good and evil for me to do.

You don't have the right to do what you want to yourself. That's your assumption, not a self-evident truth. The very idea that you can do absolutely what you want to yourself is incoherent. It undermines the very basis of morality. You're effectively saying the objective good doesn't matter. What matters is what I want to do. That annihilates all morality.I also said nothing about do-gooders. I never said I supported do-gooders. What sorts of legal measures ought to exist is a prudential judgement. In this case, it's clear that drug use should be criminalized.reply100110011001 root | Everything you're saying is word salad nonsense.> The very idea that you can do absolutely what you want to yourself is incoherentYou being confused has nothing to do with the idea.> That annihilates all morality.Your morality.

Remember, we are talking about ingesting drugs, not hitting other people.replymolsongolden root | Devil’s advocate–some of the examples in this thread are of people doing drugs to the point of triggering negative externalities.Is there a point at which drug use should be considered antisocial and unacceptable?replyWalterBright root | Legalizing drug use does not shield them from liability for committing crimes.replydlkf root | But it allows for an increase of the frequency at which those crimes are committed - at which point it’s too late. Sure, can punish the criminal afterwards, but the victim has already sufferred.replydlkf root | > In case you aren't, being able to do what you want with your own body does not include a right to harm othersYou have to make the argument that drug use doesn’t harm others. In a libertarian thought experiment maybe it doesn’t, but in the real world it does.In particular, we tend to criminalise behaviors that increase the risk of harming others. Consider drunk driving. Nobody is harmed if I don’t have an accident. But the risk of an accident increases, so we criminalize it. The same is true of hard drugs. The probability I will harm others conditional on meth addiction is higher than the background probability.replyWalterBright root | This is not as tricky as you think. Drinking alcohol is legal. Drunk driving is not. Taking drugs is legal. Driving while high is not.replyvacuity root | Arguably, the effect of an altered mental state through addiction is another issue in terms of culpability and remediation.replyWalterBright root | Diminished capacity while drunk or high is not an excuse for committing crimes.replyvacuity root | Of course not, but how to deal with the crime afterwards is more complicated than if the person was sober, I should think.replyWalterBright root | Why?replyhardware2win root | This does not apply to addicted pplreplyteolandon root | Whole lot of assertions here that a lot of people would disagree with. Why does \"right\" presuppose an objective good? Why is harming oneself objectively evil?replylo_zamoyski root | And they'd be wrong. The whole raison d'etre of rights, the whole purpose, is to \"secure\" some good end due to us by nature. It is a kind of \"debt\" in the sense that we are owed something from others. If we have a right to something, then it is something others must render unto us. Only goods are owed. It makes absolutely no sense to talk about \"brute rights\" that are just because they are. The burden is on those who claim them to explain why they have a right to something, and that explanation is going to be one that appeals to a good that is due by virtue of being a human being.If these people you mention took the time to examine the concept of right and had the honesty to search for an justification for them, they would see that rights are always for the sake of some good end, and an end that is due by virtue of being a human being. Take freedom, which is the ability to pursue the good as determined by human nature. A lack of freedom is an impediment to that pursuit in some way. Freedom isn't an end in itself. It is that by which we are able to pursue the good. We do not have the freedom to pursue evil. So it is with rights.replypcthrowaway root | Ah yes, let's make it illegal to commit suicide, and maybe even insert ourselves in some way so people can't get away with suicide.It's better if people who are suffering from issues that have no chance of relenting continue to suffer indefinitely.reply100110011001 root | > The very idea of \"right\" presupposes an objective goodNo it doesn't. Not even a little bit. This is complete nonsense and without it, your entire argument breaks down.Can you share the objective criteria you use to judge things? Also can you send me a list of everything you eat, drink, and do, so that I can make sure you are doing only \"objectively good\" things?replyhoweyc root | > \"I have the right to harm myself if I choose\"Yesreplyfennecfoxy Eh, I think shame as a societal tool is outmoded anyway. Sure, it can be used by our monkey brains to enforce \"the greater good\" as judged by our peers, but in some countries \"the greater good\" is throwing gay men off buildings.The US is filled with so many contrasting opinions that it's a survival skill to be able to ignore people trying to induce feelings of \"shame\". Whether you're a liberal who doesn't want to feel shameful that you're a feminist, or gay, or want healthcare for everyone, or a republican who doesn't want to feel shameful that you're against gay and trans people existing, want to ban abortion, throw the economy to the war machine etc.I don't think your argument extends at all to a hard drugs problem, though. As a gay man who has learnt to ignore the \"shame\" of being gay and to ignore the (surprisingly still high number of) people that shoot me disgusted looks if I dare to hold a man's hand in public, I'm not also going to suddenly _not_ feel shameful if I get into hard drugs.Also, I don't think you understand hard drugs at all. Pretty sure \"shame\" isn't even a blip on the radar of the awareness of the hard drug user, across all cultures and all of history, such drugs have been so potent that the addicted can only focus on the next fix; things like shame and morality sink into the background as effects of withdrawal from the drug take hold.For example, China has a strong, stroooong culture of shame and societal shaming, but they still had that trouble with Opium, by your logic enough shame would've stamped that out immediately. People on those drugs don't work like people not on those drugs.replyellisd This is a fascinating view on the sedative crisis. The lack of shame from \"normal\" people feels very real. Complete inaction to the staggering and ever increasing death count rate and bodies piling on the ground IS utterly shameful, but not for 2023 USA.I've noticed as well that when I've spoke to friends and family about open drug use and markets I become the one who's \"out of line.\"Do we as a free society have no shame left to express?replyryandrake root | There's a huge strain of \"mind your own business\" running through the USA right now. When someone is out of line, you used to be able to rely on the public to correct that behavior. Now if you try, you're the bad guy--or \"Karen\" as they say, and everyone flips out their cell phone cameras to try to capture that crazed weirdo who has the audacity to ask someone else to behave themselves.I brought my kid to a pumpkin patch for Halloween last year and this lady told her kids to simply cut in line so they can go do some fun thing first. I thought to myself \"crap, I can't say anything because you know what'll happen.\" My elderly father didn't have that inner voice and told the lady to get her kids to the back of the line. Well, as I expected, lady totally went bananas, whipped out her cellphone, shouting \"you don't talk to my kids!\" calling my old man a racist... everything under the sun.We're expected to simply sit back, mind our own business, and ignore bad/destructive behavior. If you believe in the social contract you're out of line.replyone_level_deep root | == When someone is out of line, you used to be able to rely on the public to correct that behavior.

You think that a few decades ago that lady would have meekly apologized and walked away?replyryandrake root | I think the new phenomenon is how many people are now on the asshole's side, or are in the neutral \"don't get involved\" camp.replyjadtz root | No, I don't think that assholes are a new phenomenon, and I agree that rude and entitled behavior has always existed. However, societal norms and expectations regarding how to handle such situations may have evolved over time. In the past, confrontation might have been more common.replyjorts root | I would have no problem calling someone out for being a shitty person in that scenario. How people respond has probably evolved a bit with social media and cell phones but it’s not my problem if someone reacts immaturely to me pointing out that they’re rude.replygloosx Addiction is a perpetual Ouroboros of shame. It is essential to understand this truth before ever wanting to integrate more shame into this problem.If one chooses addiction - well, it is an authority that moderates his behavior – the substance. Any shame will only make its rule stronger.The infantilization of society is a myth, society never really grew up to the point of understanding the universal truth - that kindness, support, re-integration, participation, gratitude - these are our allies to fix the society problems - not shame, guilt, isolation and indifference.replynroms root | I think there's something in between the polarity you've got there, something like \"tough love\". I think too much policy is based on emotional ideas, instead of seeing 'kindness, support, and re-integration' as ends of those ideal policies. People cannot just heroically decide to be kind in the face of an overwhelming issue.I also think there's a point where things have slid so far that we need some measures that appear inhumane on the surface, but solve the problem more meaningfully. I think of the protesters in Toronto hoping to permanently protect the tent villages established in Trinity-Bellwoods inner city park, even blocking the police from clearing people out of their \"homes\". If we go on with policies like \"give out free tents\" that are the epitome of band-aid emotionally driven ideas It's hard to see how we aren't simply incentivizing the problem to grow.It's as though some people genuinely think the permanent slums as in india or brazil are a solution and not a problem.replydehrmann I've worked with a number of people from rich European countries. Sometimes, they'd extol the virtues of their social programs, and I'd ask what keeps people from just mooching of them. The answer was always some combination of pride, shame, and sense of common purpose.replyrobodan Shame relies on personal connections that they want to keep. People turning to drugs are already losing those connections at a rapid rate. Trying to shame them as they walk out the door isn't going to do anything.America already has an epidemic of loneliness. Chemical numbing is a symptom of this.replywkat4242 Shame is a bad thing IMO. It's basically self-deprecation as a result of peer pressure.The thing is, peers aren't always right. In many cases the masses impose their self-centered views on arbitrary topics. It's not always about something as self-destructive as hard drugs, or even self-destructive at all.You might live in a highly religious community but have LGBT+ feelings. You might wish to enjoy playing games though your community feels those are for kids. You might like particular kinks that others are frowning upon.Feeling ashamed because of others' judgment in those cases is purely self-deprecating and holding the person back from truly finding themselves.In many cases resistance to shame is a great thing and promotes diversity. Avoiding hard drugs is not even a matter of shame but the lack of realisation that a person is destroying themself.replychris_wot root | There is good shame and bad shame. If you murder someone, then you should rightly feel shame. If you are gay, then you should not feel shame. Shame can work both ways.replywkat4242 root | With murder it's not really shame you should feel but sadness and regret about what you did to someone else. Those feelings target the victims directly, not society as a whole which has very little to do with this.Of course if someone commits premeditated murder, they are well beyond shame being an influence on their behavior anyway. There are much more forceful consequences like a prison sentence that they also ignored.replySolvency root | LOL and who exactly do you think are the fair, wise, omnipotent arbiters of \"good shame\"?Religion? CNN? Fox News?

Shame can work both ways.Anything can go both ways.In the past you can go to jail for being gay (and still in some parts of the world).replychris_wot root | Yes, but I'd argue that is likely the bad shame that is unproductive and unnecessary.replyoldpmfan I don't agree. Germany for example is pretty shameless beyond the shame border in USA. To give you a few maybe extreme examples (which does not apply to all people in Germany and not all this examples are sexual): Mixed saunas, swinger clubs, open relationships, no shame on being naked in designated nudity areas, topless DJs, a naked women is not a big skandal etc.Yet Germany does not have the drug problems which Oregon has.USA has a big shame problem (just look at IG) in sense of nudity and nipples (which is spreading around the globe thanks to US tech) yet you say shame is devalued in USA.I think I just debunked your theory (sorry for that) but it's not shame.replyrayiner root | You’re giving examples of where the German social norms allow things that are taboo under US social norms. That’s not what shame is about. Shame is a feeling that societies use to enforce social norms and taboos—whatever those norms happen to be.America is a very individualistic society—people can violate social norms and they don’t feel shame, because they say “who cares what other people think?” My impression of Germany—which is second hand, my wife lived there and I know lots of Germans—is that it is a less individualistic society. Society might allow certain things, but where society doesn't allow those things, there is strong shame-based social pressure.At least when my wife was living in east Germany in the early 2000s, drug use was one of those taboos. When she mentioned smoking marijuana—something that didn’t raise eyebrows among other teenagers at her rural Iowa high school—the reaction from German students was very negative.replyoldpmfan root | I was born and raised in Germany and I give a f*ck what other people think (I care ZERO percent). But to be honest I also left Germany (because I'm fortunate enough to do that) because society is blind in sense of taxes, social insurance etc especially if you are an entrepreneur. Rich or wealthy people in Germany are considered to be thieves or inherits of something/somebody. Believe it or not but many Germans feel ashamed when being wealthy (or they do not speak about their wealth ever, keep it a secret).My thinking is that shame is a very broad term and there are many societies on Earth which are more shameless than USA with relaxed drug laws and DO NOT HAVE that drug problem.replyPaulDavisThe1st root | > Rich or wealthy people in Germany are considered to be thieves or inherits of something/somebody. Believe it or not but many Germans feel ashamed when being wealthy (or they do not speak about their wealth ever, keep it a secret).Yay, another thing Germany (post-WWII) got right, in addition to mechanical and electrical engineering and the early use of synthesizers.replyconstantcrying root | It is also utterly destructive for any industrial country to have a population which devalues being successful.\"Unreasonably wealthy\" means able to buy a house, by the way.replybbarnett root | It's just backdoor socialism. More and more people are constantly praddling on about how \"the wealthy\" are the problem, but that's utter nonsense, and IMO has no place in a democratic society.As with anything else, the answer is to \"raise everyone up\", not \"pull those down who have obtained something\". And for the record, I am OK with taxing those with higher incomes at a higher rate. What I'm not OK with is the quite literally insane concept of \"take all that money in one tax year\", or \"make sure no one can ever stay wealthy\".The absurd notion of \"if you have more than $x, we'll take it ALL!\" is pure socialism, lacks any idea of how monetary systems work, how taxation works, and how much value doing that brings.For example, if you took every billionaire's liquid cash in the US, you'd barely notice it at the federal level, and then next year? There's be nothing to take.This is primarily because to 'take that billionaire's net worth!!', you'd have to take ownership of a massive amount of stocks, commodities, and so on. Let's say billionaire G owns 70% of Big Corp H, and that ownership is worth $2B.Great. So you 'tax' it. So how does that work?Does the billionaire have to sell if off, and give cash? How does that happen? Remember, all other wealthy people are having their fortunes stripped, so who do you even sell it to?And if you just hand over the shares to the government, what are they going to do with it? Sell it? To whom? No one has large amounts of disposable cash now, it's all been taken!None of these weirdo comments about \"fuck people with $10 in their pocket!\" make sense.replyconstantcrying root | To me it is always politics of envy. Of course nobody has some inherent qualities that make him \"deserve\" enormous amounts of money, but that isn't \"fixable\", it also is not particularly relevant if you cared about people having decent safety nets.As an aside, I very much dislike progressive tax rates. It essentially punishes productivity, as each additional hour worked reduces your money earned. Most of the working population should have the same tax rate.>And if you just hand over the shares to the government, what are they going to do with it?In Europe many states are large shareholders into companies. In the US you have e.g. pension funds who own very large amounts of capital. In Europe you have many companies where regional governments own a lot of shares.replyrayiner root | > Believe it or not but many Germans feel ashamed when being wealthy (or they do not speak about their wealth ever, keep it a secret).Sounds like (1) Germany does enforce social norms through shame; and (2) you do care what people think enough to move to a society where people don’t shame you for trying to get rich.replyunlikelymordant root | Being ashamed about nudity is i beieve a totally different thing. The shame op is talking about is feeling bad when you have cheated your neighbours, or being ashamed of doing something that lands you in jail i.e. caring about your reputation as a good human. Nudity in public is completely orthogonal to any of that imho, and is more of a cultural norm.replyoldpmfan root | total nudity is in relation to reputation to being as a good human for many US Americans.Of course there is also some value in your proposition but saying that a society is totally shameless yet keeps cultural norms very high (like USA with nudity) does contradict the initial claim. It's something else then.replyunlikelymordant root | I get what you are saying. Perhaps its a morphing of what exactly people find shameful is the thing OP was talking about then. Where he identifies a lack of shame, its really just the shame is concentrated on completely different actions, and it makes the culture seem strange and wrong to a person on the other side.replyhackinthebochs root | Your response misses the target the parent was getting at. There are laws that constrain behavior in public places derived from the taboos of the past. This is what you are referring to when you talk about limits to nudity and such. These laws may derive from shame culture of the past, but they have modern relevance largely due to the existence of laws.There's another form of shame culture that isn't codified into law but constrains behavior due to the potential reduction in social status for breaking various taboos. Essentially part one's feelings of status is sourced externally and this provides a moderating effect on one's behavior. The problem is that modern society has seen a stark reduction in the effectiveness of this kind of shame culture. We've essentially devalued the prevailing culture in favor of various sub/counter cultures. Now every degenerate interest has a sub-culture formed around it that insulates anyone who identifies with it from the shame of going against the prevailing culture. The usefulness of shame for reinforcing social norms has been eliminated to disastrous effect.replyClumsyPilot root | It is not, in fact, different at all. Being seen naked in public affects your status. Being seen consuming drugs affects your status. All shame is, is degradation of your status.replyhackinthebochs root | The issue isn't about an external person's judgment, but one's sensitivity to an external person's judgment. The point is that mainstream culture has been devalued such that sensitivity to alterations in status as judged by people deemed \"mainstream\" is much less relevant to an average person these days, especially in younger folks. If there were no laws about public nudity, there are subcultures that absolutely would go around naked and would be immune to shame from mainstream culture.replyflycaliguy root | I’ve been shamed for j-walking in Germany. Sorry, you didn’t debunk anything you just invited a bunch of puritanical nonsense to the nude beach.replynmfisher root | Me too, but that goes to prove OP's point. Jay-walking isn't just a crime, it's basically a social faux in Germany, which is why it doesn't happen that often.replywhearyou root | But in Germany, if you cut in line, huge shame. I’m in Israel, not as many orgy clubs (I assume?) but more people cut in line. There’s shame about different things.replyconstantcrying root | >I think I just debunked your theory (sorry for that) but it's not shame.You didn't. It is even somewhat irrelevant, as being shamed for sexual perversion is utterly unrelated to not being ashamed of using drugs.replytayo42 root | How many social safety nets does Germany have compared to the US and Oregon. My guess is a lot more and probably a less isolated culture, more family friends around, cheaper cost of living too. This shame thing your all rambling seems to be a red herringreply8note The US devalued shame by using it for everything.The big change recently is the me-too movement to change from shame into consequences, which is good for people with something to loseBut, with the moves towards feudalism in the states, there's too many people with nothing to lose, and both shame and consequences depend on having some status to maintainreplyezekiel68 I actually agree with you -- from the standpoint of socially influencing others who are not already addicts.There is no true addict on the planet however (of any substance or behavior) who will hit \"rock bottom\", as they say, and moderate their addictive behavior due to shame. So I feel that some of the blowback you are receiving here is related to the notion (true or not) that public shame applied to addiction for the purpose of influencing non-addicts is equvalent to \"giving up\" on addicts themselves (and therefore not worth that cost).replypierat > The USA and a few other cultures have unfortunately devalued shame to the point where it holds nearly no cultural power.Wait, are you talking about \"personal\" shame, or \"corporate\" shame.

Having shame will only ever interfere with the pursuit of money. As we live in a capitalist society money is the only important thing in life. You literally cannot live without it. Why would I have shame? Why would anyone? Love? Family? Friends? Those do not pay the bills. As we are hyper individualist and capitalist there is no moral or ethical cohesive force beyond the ability to secure money.

It doesnt get me any benefits, and all it is a whole lot of \"costs\", all of which are ill defined.All of your \"polite\" behavior is modified by shame. To use an extreme, contrived, example if you shit on the floor your parents probably shamed you into using the restroom properly. You can, of course, continue to shit on the floor but you also can't act with such righteous indignation when no one wants you around. Perhaps you find a group of people who shit on the floor. But then they, too, will have their own shame-based norms that will you either comply to or be ostracized from the group.Now, scratch the example of shitting on the floor and replace it with any other behavior. Depending on the group you belong to (or are trying to belong to) shame is an effective way in enforcing expected behavior. It's one of the things that separate us from other animals. If you don't respond to shame (rather than just acting like it) you are not quirky and original you are likely a sociopath.replyop00to root | Uh, as a person who recently potty trained two people, I did not use shame to teach my kids how to use the toilet.When a child had an accident, we acknowledged it, cleaned up, and moved on.

Correlation with depressive symptoms etc. Hopefully anyone with kids should have realised that making e.g. toilet training more stressful, surprise surprise, is completely counter-productive, but who knows.If the kid knows that they're not supposed to do something, that's enough - they experience their own internal feeling of failure strongly. I've found that the opposite is usually true, that kids never understand that learning things always involves failing a bunch of times, which is the imore important meta-lessonFlipside, if they don't care about doing something wrong and you shame them, in my experience they often simply don't give a fuck. Maybe that's my own genetics though. Admonishment and punishment is more useful.replyMobiusHorizons root | Society certainly still tries to impose the contract, we just don't seem to agree on what it is. Think about how people reacted (both on the right and the left) to covid restrictions. In some communities you were a pariah if you wore a mask in any context, and in others you were a pariah if you didn't get the vaccine. Regardless of what you think the correct behavior there was, there were very strong pockets of society where shame was being leveraged for some form of social contract, the contract was just not the same everywhere. I believe the same dynamic is true (although thankfully somewhat less charged) when it comes to opinions about various political issues or beliefs.replyryanwaggoner root | It’s kinda horrifying that you think shaming kids is how you teach them anything.replyzer8k root | > horrifyingYour ability to understand hyperbole as a storytelling device is absolutely nonexistent.

I think that yeah, some of that went away, but another wave in another form is being created right now. Take a look at things like the fitness movement, NOFAP (which I think it's BS but that's beside the point), etc.A lot of individuals get lost in this cultural transitional period, but I think this always happened. A good example was the hippy movement, they where very drug and free sex positive too. Society as whole will be OK I think, other non-legal checks and boundaries are being set up to prevent a major collapse. Collectively we learn from mistakes and correct for extreme behaviors.replytelchior > The USA and a few other cultures have unfortunately devalued shameShame is admittedly a very powerful tool for social conformity. During the few centuries that you seem to view as the good old days, it was used to great effect for blocking many different behaviors. Among those: not dressing in quite the right way; having dark skin; insufficient patriotism; insufficient aggression in men; the desire for autonomy in women; homosexuality, or for that matter basically any acknowledgement that humans are an innately sexual species.And then society broke, gosh darn it!The problem with bringing back those good old days of shame, but of course just in the way that's nice and beneficial, is that a huge number of people believe that all of the above listed shameful behaviors of yesteryear should still be shameful. Shame is the mechanism that various conservatives are using, at this very instant, in trying to brand all gay people as groomers, or all people who get abortions as murderers and/or worthless sluts.So, in my humble opinion, it ain't happening; how are you going to get any kind of agreement about what behaviors are good to shame? Pandora's box has been opened for half of humanity, who all generally agree that non-harmful behaviors should not be shamed, while things like flagrant violations of election law or finance law should be; while the other half continues to vociferously insist that non-harmful social behaviors are the only real priority and the golden days would come back if only we could all hate the deviants again.replywebnrrd2k I dont think that I buy your line of reasoning. For one thing, historically, a lot of social contacts were based on ignorance and bullshit. Women were persecuted for being witches, people were killed for having the wrong religion, race, sexuality. There are many episodes in history where this was socially sanctioned and approved by authority figures.I think people are right to have a healthy dose of doubt and even disrespect for authority figures. That's far from infantilization. It's learning to think for yourself and to choose carefully who you take as an authority.As far as addiction goes, the US had a pretty long experiment with authority figures telling people to just say no.

Korean Cryt. Growth Cryst. Techn. {\\bf 33}, 61 (2023)] provides some experimental indications that Pb 10−x Cu x (PO 4 ) 6 O withx≈1 , coined LK-99, might be a room-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure. Our density-functional theory calculations show lattice parameters and a volume contraction withx-- very similar to experiment. The DFT electronic structure shows Cu 2+in a3 d 9configuration with two extremely flat Cu bands crossing the Fermi energy. This puts Pb 9 Cu(PO 4 ) 6 O in an ultra-correlated regime and suggests that, without doping, it is a Mott or charge transfer insulator. If doped such an electronic structure might support flat-band superconductivity or an correlation-enhanced electron-phonon mechanism, whereas a diamagnet without superconductivity appears to be rather at odds with our results.

    "commentBody": "Electronic Structure of LK-99 (arxiv.org)347 points by spekcular 277 commentsbluecoconut I got my PhD studying band structure of high-tc superconductors (experimentalist, ARPES). These Cu d-d interactions right at the fermi energy give me huge hope. Feels very familiar to other superconductors (re: all the cuprates). (Note: I specifically worked in a lab that was measuring a lot of the d-wave character / gap-energies of various superconductors)All in all, I'm now much more bullish on LK-99 being real superconductivity after seeing multiple different labs compute similar band structures. The video of multiple directions of magnet showing some levitation also inspires a lot of hope.replyjpmattia > These Cu d-d interactions right at the fermi energy give me huge hope. Feels very familiar to other superconductors (re: all the cuprates).As someone who is versed in semiconductor band structures but not superconductor band structures: What is it about Cu d-d interactions that causes the superconductivity?Degenerate energies in semiconductors don't give rise to electron pairing, so I'm a bit out to sea with the proposed mechanism here.replybluecoconut root | To be honest, this is a hunch thing more than a I can teach and explain it thing. To me it's just \"a lot of the same stories\" that are told about cuprates, and less of a \"I can explain the mechanism\".Roughly, one of the \"properties\" that shows up with these materials is that the 3d orbitals of coper atoms are involved in forming the bands near the fermi level. Couple that with the fun story of Cu electron configuration being [Ar] 3d^10 4s^1, which suggests that spin-effects are \"at play\" with these electrons near their filling levels. Combine that with the spin-character properties of cuprate paring (eg. s-wave vs. d-wave superconductors, (d-wave for BSCCO for instance)). All together it lends itself to a nice spin-orbit coupled band \"setup\" at the fermi energy that I have a hunch somehow backs the underlying mechanism of these d-wave superconductors. Fully admit, there's some leaps there in the raw logic -- if I could fully explain it I probably would still be in the field, haha.I'll note: I've been out of the field for ~8 years, but a quick google search led to some more recent papers [1][2] working through plausible explanations based on some of these copper d orbital shenanigans.[1] https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=... [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11664 (d-p, but includes the Cu d-orbital and also specifically states \"We also show that the effect of the nearest-neighbor d-d Coulomb interaction Vdd is actually quite important for the stability of superconductivity and phase competition.\")replyjpmattia root | > To me it's just \"a lot of the same stories\" that are told about cuprates, and less of a \"I can explain the mechanism\".Fair enough, and thanks for the readout. I realized after posting I essentially demanded an explanation as to why the cuprates are high-Tc, which is probably its own Nobel prize.replyloxias root | > To be honest, this is a hunch thing more than a I can teach and explain it thing...Chiming in, not just you. :) I very briefly studied materials science a few decades ago and I'm 0% surprised that a potential breakthrough involves, of course, cuprates.replyfaraggi root | Any plans on going back to your field with these discoveries?replym3kw9 root | Very cool explanation, I didn’t understand a word you saidreplyBaeocystin Serious question- I saw the original video, where once they stopped waving the magnet around and held it near the sheet of LK-99, it looked to me like it stayed at a specific standoff distance, with no decay.Assuming no videographic trickery, what else could it be, other than the Meissner effect?replyoxfordmale 41 root | The Meissner effect requires a temperature transition in the diamagnetic behaviour. As you increase the temperature, you would expect a sharp drop with the material falling back on the magnet, and then levitating again once the temperature drops.replyoceanghost root | A diamagnetic material.\"In simple terms, diamagnetic materials are substances that are usually repelled by a magnetic field. Electrons in an atom revolve around the nucleus, and thus possess orbital angular momentum. The resultant magnetic momentum in an atom of the diamagnetic material is zero.\"replyBaeocystin root | Am I correct in my understanding that being capable of self-levitation would be an unusually strong example of the diamagnetic effect?replylucubratory root | Yes, if this material is diamagnetic without being a superconductor it is by far the strongest such material we've ever found. 15x stronger than pyrolitic graphite.replytavavex root | From what I heard, it would. This kind of diamagnetism would be strong enough to be potentially interesting in other applications and research, if it turns out not to be a superconductor.replynine_k root | Would still be useful for maglev, I assume?replywhatshisface root | I think ChatGPT wrote that because it is nonsense.replySamPatt Thanks for your input.What would you need to see to say \"I am 100% convinced this is / isn't real\"?And how long would you expect it will be before that occurs?replybluecoconut root | I'd probably approach 90% confidence with ~2-3 different measurements from different labs showing similar stories. Select from the grab bag of possible experiments that could all collaborate and provide consistency in their stories: specifically things like measuring the critical current, critical magnetic field, high quality electrical resistance in various ways (lots of transport), STM measurements of gaps, ARPES measurements of gaps, XRD showing crystal structures are what we expect that matches the DFT, a study on the domain sizes/effects (since this is relying on a substition at the right place, necessarily I suspect that there will be domain effects / \"doping\" style things... so how those play out in terms of purity and quality of results will be interesting). There will be a lot to study and characterize, and every extra measurement that is consistent rapidly increases that confidence. I'd say I'd get to \"100%\" (as close as someone could be) after ~10-20 papers across many different labs and measurements. I'd hope we'd get there in ~3-6 months.What I'm actually even slightly more excited about is \"what comes next\" -- not the market part, but the \"fast follow science\". For instance, in the few years after LCBO and LSCO were found (TC~30K) we quickly found YBCO and BSCCO (Tc~130K). I would expect that we'll find a whole class of these materials with substitution tricks that possibly work, and there will be a whole slew of options for \"going to market\" with the technology. The door this opens is what is more exciting than the specifics of LK-99 itself in my opinion.Estimating times, after the fast follow science (0.5-2 years optimistically?) we will hopefully have the actual \"we're all convinced this is real, and the technology can start to be applied in real devices\". Specifically, after everyone is pretty clear on a lot of the material properties and ways to reproducibly make high-quality crystals, so consistency is clear on measurements... then begins the cycles on how to manufacture high enough quality material at scale that it can actually be applied. (specifically, these materials (assuming they're like YCBO/BSCCO) are superconducting crystals that have grains, alignment issues, are physically brittle, have homogeneity issues, etc.) While each solvable, these are all real engineering and material challenges that increase cost to manufacture, and all of this will probably take time before we suddenly get wide-scale products that use this (this is all assuming it's real, haha, there's still plenty of reason to be skeptical).replyxorbax root | I think a funded and forward-thinking lab with enough postdocs would be trying to grind out a version replacing lead with gold, per the DFT calculationsFew will remember the million replications, but whoever describes a novel version - even if it's no better - will find themselves on equal footing for helping to understand what's happeningreplySamPatt root | Thanks for your thoughts!replyRandomBK root | I'm not a scientist, but personally I expect I'll have two \"wow, this is really happening\" moments:(1) When there's peer-reviewed replication from a group of reputable labs.(2) When I see the classic superconductor-on-magnetic-track demo, but without liquid nitrogen.replyfragmede root | https://nitter.net/lereguy/status/1686363900651151360 is no https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPqEEZa2Gis but it's on the way there!replyJKCalhoun root | Waiting for Applied Science (the YouTuber) to make some in his lab.replyeco root | I think he might be working on it.

But the mention of Salvatore Cezar Pais in the patent should be enough to put this to bed for serious folks.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36967333In case you aren't familiar with the man's work, here are some highlights of his discoveries over the last decade:Conditional possibility of spacecraft propulsion at superluminal speedsHigh frequency gravitational waves-induced propulsionPiezoelectricity-induced room temperature superconductorCraft using an inertial mass reduction deviceOn the Existence of the Superforce–the possible fundamental Force of Unificationhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=7%2C39&q=Sal...I can't wait for my cheap antigrav FTL iron man suit to arrive next year.replymartinclayton root | It looks like the citation of the Pais patent was added by the examiner, rather than by the applicants.

I mean, isn't zero resistance the defining property?replyrvnx 47 root | Just guessing: I would say not enough because the sample is extremely small and there is chance that the electrons jump from each sides of the probes, skipping the sample ? (like a short-circuit) + the fact that the probes themselves are not superconductor, so there is a natural accepted tolerance in the measures (claimed to be due to the probes)replyOJFord root | I think if it was actually zero it would be? The issue I think is impurity/defects in the manufactured samples, so there's non-superconducting bits in addition to the allegedly superconducting bits.replyvrotaru root | Well, I guess, that are islands of superconductivity and normal conductivity in the same sample.This gives a low resistance and diamagnetism which is used as proxy to real superconductivity.I may be wrong though.replyjurgenaut23 Beyond the raw scientific excitement, can you explain how this would affect mankind (positively and, of course, perhaps negatively)?replyxvector root | Impact of superconductors: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1685088625187495936.htmlreplyMrBuddyCasino This is probably the most stupid question to ask, but while were are still trying to confirm superconductivity instead of understanding its precise mechanism of operation, why the focus on levitation on band structure to confirm the news instead of just \"yep this chunk has actually zero Ohms\"?replypjc50 root | \"zero ohms\" is very tricky to measure because of contact resistance: your probes aren't superconducting, and the thin contact surface between your probes and the metal itself isn't superconducting either.Whereas the Meissner effect is unique to superconductors. It just has to be distinguished from diamagnetism, and there are materials which are strongly diamagnetic but not superconductors.replysamhuk 41 My ultimate take-away about LK-99 since the start has been that, even if it doesn't turn out to be a holy-grail or whatever, the novel ideas behind the material are incredibly interesting.The idea of causing tiny (~0.5%) crystal lattice shrinkage with cuprate percolation is a really interesting idea.So far, only huge pressures or very low temperatures (i.e. Physics) have been used to cause that shrinkage, therefore perhaps LK-99 could, at the least, mark the time that Physicists hold up their hands, admit that they have failed, and let the Chemists give it a shot.I'm slightly oversimplifying the situation, of course, and the disciplines of science cannot be so distinctly separated, but, y'know.replyjeffbee The most interesting phenomenon revealed so far is that the room-temperature superconductor people and the generative-LLMs-are-God people draw on the same limited global pool of credulity, such that HN cannot be flooded with both ChatGPT worship and superconductor speculation at the same time.replyjacquesm Jeffbee in the 1947 edition: The most interesting phenomenon revealed so far is that the solid state electronics people and the rocket fanatics people draw on the same limited global pool of credulity, such that TinkererNews cannot be flooded with both transistor worship and moon travel speculation at the same time.Seriously: if it doesn't interest you, you could simply refrain from commenting and even reading. This stuff is the bleeding edge of tech and if you consider everybody active in these fields or talking about it to be starry eyed children then you should re-calibrate your sense of what these scientific discoveries are likely to cause further downstream. The idea here is to find some balance, it's perfectly ok to discuss a new discovery and to consider the implications on the caveat that it might not pan out. But superconductors already exist, there is no reason in physics why an arbitrary temperature cut-off is going to limit them from existing at room temperature, if you look at the trend since superconductivity was first observed there is a steady increase which with ever smaller margin of error predicts a breakthrough somewhere around 2030. It arrived a bit early, but it - apparently - did arrive, and if true will lead to a revolution in power transmission. And if it isn't true then we'll just drop it and hope for the next round, but I suspect that even if it isn't true there are going to be a lot of labs wondering if they can salvage at least some knowledge gained during all the scrutiny of this particular attempt.Similar trends can be observed rectro-actively for practical solar panels, micro electronics, powered flight and so on. All had their skeptics, sometimes unreasonable skeptics and all were proven eventually wrong an those inventions transformed our world and are still transforming our world. You see a stupid silly black fleck floating over a magnet and wonder what the big deal is. I see a glimpse of an alternative future that has a lot of potential implications for how we live.replypjc50 root | I think we're all horribly burned out by pop-science.

While the transistor succeeded to an extent nobody imagined due to the magic of compounding improvements.> You see a stupid silly black fleck floating over a magnetMeanwhile over in the AI \"optimism\" channel people are telling us that AI will be able to produce videos of anything that are indistinguishable from reality, and that we should all learn never to believe video evidence again.I'm still very much in the \"don't know\" camp on the superconductor, but what I do know is that it's not worth getting excited until we know it's real.replyfeoren 43 root | > Meanwhile over in the AI \"optimism\" channel people are telling us ...I'm not sure why this line of reasoning is so prevalent. Someone says \"There's strong evidence for A\" and the reply is \"yes but someone who is not currently in the conversation also said there was strong evidence for B and that is wrong! Therefore you are silly for believing in A!\" What? We're not supposed to be optimistic when we see strong evidence for a breakthrough in a phenomenon we already knew existed, because someone else believes something else!? Because some other person believes in ghosts and psychic powers, no one is allowed to believe anything? These are different people making different claims! It's insanity.replypjc50 35 root | My argument was that the _video_ evidence is not strong, because it's poor quality and videos are easy to fake, while also linking this to another piece of techno-optimism which has made it easier to fake videos.replympixel root | I think it's equally wrong to compare this whole thing to solar panels and whatnot.That said, in general, 9 out of 10 things that are very promising will ultimately fail, and there's nothing wrong with discussing or following all 10, the 1 will work, and it'll be great.replythrowawaylinux root | Despite the the \"strictly no jesting on the super serious hacker news\" rule, I think it was just a joke. I wouldn't let it get to you too much. I thought it was pretty funny.replySamPatt The least interesting phenomenon revealed so far is that HN is split into a group who are entertained by watching and discussing emerging tech / science news, and a second group who are entertained by disparaging the first.I enjoy watching floating rocks and talking to computers.replyValgrim root | Same with me, it gives me the same feeling of \"Living in a science fiction world\" that I once felt when cell phones or Google maps came out.Of course even tough I still use both profusely every day, the feeling of novelty wore out. I expect the same will happen with this.replyjiggawatts root | In an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation a redshirt used a tricorder to check the weather and said they would have to beam up soon because a storm was approaching.At the time I thought to myself: “Bah, that’s never happening, it’s pure fantasy!”A few years later I told some friends we’d have to pack up our picnic because according to the weather radar app on my phone we had about 7 minutes until we got drenched… no wait… 6 minutes.5m:30s later we were standing under shelter watching the storm front rolling in, and I remembered that Star Trek scene.We live in the future.replyNovaDudely root | There was a line from the movie 'Ted', that film about a child's stuffed bear coming to life. It was something along the lines of \"No matter how special and amazing something is, eventually people get bored of it and move onto something else.\"It will probably be like this for us. The children will just take it for granted as they grow up with it, we will be endlessly amazed by it.replyforward-slashed root | To see the real value of something, take it away.

Not too excited about a lot developments in computer tech, but mostly because there is a lot of hype on technology that tends be impressive BUT misses the mark on the bold claims.But with this LK99 stuff, there is not much room for vague wiggle room. The requirements are very clearly defined and if they do it. It is done! It isn't a case of \"if in 5 years and $X billion we may be able to produce this stuff\", it is a case of they showing a working material.It is hard not to be excited for this!replytavavex root | Exact opposite for me - with stuff like AI tech, I'm a lot more familiar with the subject matter than the happenings in the material sciences, so it allows me to be more confidently optimistic about computer-related advancements. Even if my education is still insufficient to grasp the full extent of new tech, I can at least try to understand it conceptually.On the other hand, the LK-99 news seem very promising, but a lot of professionals in the field are still iffy, and everyone who's interested in emerging tech is left searching for breadcrumbs and talking to other enthusiasts. It's likely that we won't know if this is a dud or a world-changing discovery for several weeks to months...I've been trying to be as cautious as possible when looking at the recent news, but it's difficult to not be cautiously optimistic about at least some things.replyNovaDudely root | That is pretty cool, I mean, I do get the excitement of the technology of things like AI - I fall more in line with the philosophers or \"but what does it really all mean\". I'm not sure if what I do is useful at all other than a mental toy to play with. It is more that some folks act like it is the end of all work, others say it is the end of humanity itself - the reality is definitely in the middle there!When it comes to this stuff there is a fine line between pessimist and optimist. Too optimistic and you will be left disappointed. To pessimistic and you risk being labelled a loom smashing luddite.I always appreciate those that see the bright future, they will push the technology forward regardless of what others say, but that can also be the path to ruin - as they say, the road to hell is paved with good deeds. It seems as though, we do not know if something is good or not until it is done.Like with the LK99 news, what it is delivered everything promised. Could this just be the next step of the rebound effect, and we just feed into our base desires and consume even more of everything? It is possible, but we probably won't know until it is well in the rear view mirror.Interesting times ahead.replyr00fus root | Skepticism is a survival skill. That said, I'd be happy to be wrong in this case!replyfouc root | > a lot of professionals in the field are still iffyThat seems like a strange perception. I'm seeing the opposite.replytavavex root | When the news had first made the rounds several days ago, the overwhelming sentiment that I felt was \"meh, this seems so unprofessional. Probably just another fabrication, like all the previous ones. I guess we might as well check just to be sure\". Kind of an exaggeration, but this is what I took away then.Now that any data from third parties starts slowly dripping in, the perception seems to be changing to very cautious curiosity. No experts are putting their reputation on the line for what little information we have, but interest in this topic is definitely rising. Hence why I said they were 'iffy'.replySergeAx root | It seems to me that the second group is also entertained by discussing money, tech salaries in particular.replyswalsh It's so hard not to be crazy excited about the future. The past few months are proving to be an absolute breakout for the literal human race.So far we've seen:1. in Dec 2022 We saw a fusion breakthrough seeing a net gain in energy2. In March GPT-4 was released, which seems to be a seminal breakthrough in AI, and maybe of our first glimpse in what could become an AGI.3. In May we find out apparently our government has recovered alien technologies4. Then in July room temp super conductors just dropLike this is the most insane period of time. Maybe the fusion technology doesn't scale, maybe GPT-5 doesn't scale, maybe the UAP thing was all a psyop, or a lie, maybe LK-99 doesn't turn out. But there's so much to hope for!replyfeoren 55 root | From my perspective, LK-99 is by far the most likely to be an actual serious technological breakthrough. If it's real, it would be a breakthrough on the level of the discovery of electricity, the lens, the transistor, or the laser. One of those era-defining bottlenecks in the Civilization technology tree.GPT-4 is a nice iterative improvement over previous work, and a culmination of decades of research. It's not anywhere near an AGI and it's close to the limit of what we can accomplish with our current understanding of AI and our current availability of good data. We're near the top of the sigmoid curve on this one; new advances are going to come from specializing and integrating these models, not just making bigger ones.The fusion \"breakthrough\" is seriously underwhelming when you look at the total power in/out of the whole plant, not just a tiny tunnel-visioned window of the fusion reaction itself (ignoring power of magnetic confinement and the laser pulse), and even more when you think about how much tritium humanity has ever created. We're just not seeing what we need here and the net power output is still deeply in the negative.Lol aliens.My point, to both you and GP, is that it's quite possible to have very different levels of optimism for these recent revelations, and it's not hypocritical to do so. Details and context matter. Dozens of materials science Ph.D.s saying \"holy shit this looks like the real deal guys\" vs. one guy saying \"someone told me there were hidden stocks of blinker fluid that I wasn't allowed to see\" just does not engender the same confidence levels.replyJamisonM root | > 3. In May we find out apparently our government has recovered alien technologiesThis is a silly thing to include on the list since it doesn't seem to be true?replyxtracto root | What's up with that uh?

It may well be all true.replyjboy55 root | Regarding #1, it pains me to see so much hype about this feat.To restate it. We were able to simulate the implosion of the secondary stage of a thermonuclear device in a lab by the means of lasers, to the point that this simulation has ~ 0.001% the efficiency of a real device.We also probably learned a lot about the amplification of x-rays by the casing material that would have been useful during the SDI days of the early 80s.tldr; It was a weapons test, by a weapons lab.replyJumpCrisscross root | > It was a weapons test, by a weapons labBeyond a certain point, every energy system is a weapon first.

Isn't this exactly what a rogue super AI would do first?- run some simulations and discover a superconductor- then write up a paper on it ( the paper has some gaps but humans take it and run with it)- human technology and computing power rapidly accelerates.- the rogue AI's powers increase exponentiallyreplycooper_ganglia root | Having played through Portal 2 again recently, it's like the equivalent of GlaDOS scheming to take back over the Aperture Science Facility while she's only getting 1.1 Volts from the potato.replyBasedAnon 32 root | people forget that AI was already in control of the markets since 2014 at least. it's bootstrappingreplymjan22640 root | The oneshot or short session manner in which AI are typically used does not have a rogue potential.The AI would need to have a virtually unreachable goal, and run in an endless loop, to be able to drift its goals to be at odds with humanity.replybratbag root | As you say it, I'm tempted to try it.Doubt I'm the first.replykeepamovin Lol thank you. That’s hilarious.Also, I think it kind of sucks that all that UFO reverse engineering didn’t yield a high temperature superconductor before this… but I guess what can you expect when you sequester away all your materials, silo your research and in effect keep your neural network of nodes (as scientists) really small.This open shit, as flawed and maybe annoying as it is to some people, I think it’s a much better model of science. It’d be great to see some UFO/UFO tech breakthroughs happen like this too.replyJMill root | Perhaps, but the reverse engineering efforts you mention may have already led to incredible breakthroughs over the past few decades. Lasers, integrated circuits, Kevlar, fiber optics, and more technologies were said to have been seeded among the research community based on recovered UAP components. This is based on Army Colonel Philip Corso’s account in his memoir, “The Day After Roswell”. [1][1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After_Roswellreplykeepamovin root | I know that. I used to believe that too. I really wanted to believe all the SSP stuff (Corey Goode, David Wilcock, et al).However, my view is now that all of the talk over advanced tech has actually been a propaganda/influence/information-warfare campaign to:1) assert that gov/corp is in control when it's in fact not; pretend it's not at all challenged by superior species, not at all ignorant of 1000s-of-years-more-advanced-tech2) cover up the ignorance, powerlessness and failure to make progress on RE crash materials, an embarrassing secret that seriously dents their mandate to rule3) provide cover for the cover-up to continue in secret, trying to buy themselves \"just a bit more time\", \"maybe the next crash is the one we'll finally crack it\"It's much easier to engineer a narrative (something the US is absolutely world-class fantastic at), than it is to engineer understanding and tech from advanced civilizations possibly millions of years advanced from us, while operating in oppressive secrecy.This is not an attack on the US, they're just the most prominent. All countries have failed with this broken, deceptive, but understandably flawed and human strategy.It's a controversial view because it flies in the face of decades of this influence campaign.In short I believe that all \"military insiders\" coming forward to say they saw military successfully using/making UFO tech are liars part of this campaign. That includes, especially, Greer.^1I think the current push is much more truthful--so far. It was said a couple times by Grusch and others that we may not have made progress. And suggested that the push is designed to get it out into the open where people can study it and make progress.I don't think that noble and sensible push will win however. Folks inside the coverup will likely see this as just another \"pressure release valve\" we need to satisfy the public enough, let them work off some steam, then we can either: A) undermine it and discourage them from pursuing in future; or, B) we can let it all go away, and in the background scare lawmakers in the same way we've done for decades (show some evidence of something that frightens them, or is a national security threat, or personally intimidate them) and they'll do whatever we say.One reason I have for believing this current push will lose is because the main bobbleheads in charge of getting it out: Knapp, Coulthart, Corbell and Zabel are changing their tune and now making noises in support of continued coverup. In ^0 and in a recent video by Pope:- Nick Pope: folks aren't ready- Zabel: fuck disclosure, just need confirmation- Corbell: confirmation has already happened- Ross & Knapp: secrets must be keptI sure as hell hope not, but when you look at who we're up against: the secretkeepers have been doing this for nearly a century, and they've always won, and they believe they're right. To them this is probably a storm in a teacup, and it will take more than some grandstanding (good, but ultimately weak) politicians, and a bit of skeptical public interest, to blow the lid off.I think if people want information they should try to contact ET themselves and figure it out for themselves. You can't count on the corporation to come through for you, and the government is captured by the corporation. That much is clear.Treating gov/corp as a trusted intermediary/priest class who have access to \"divine knowledge\", and then desperately waiting for them like a \"good dog\" for treats, is just reinforcing the power dynamic of gov/corp control over citizen-subjects that itself is challenged by the awareness of ETs; and begging for such treats from such actors, when all they've done in the past is lied to and abused the public in this way, is a false hope and a flawed strategy.I think the true way to fuck with the secrecy system is to cut out the middleman, rather than hoping a continuously-proving-itself-to-not-give-a-shit-about-the-public system is going to become benevolent and \"evolve itself\".For insiders, it probably all makes perfect sense, and seems completely necessary and ethical. They have been and, until the technology's developed, will remain in, a constant state of war-time clandestine secrecy, with spies and traitors to that being executed essentially, and sophisticated counterintelligence operations continuously ongoing.The war is over the most and only significant asymmetric advantage ever discovered by humanity. Successful acquisition and deployability would mean instant world domination, or so it's assumed. Compromise of this goal is, understandably to insiders, inconceivable and impossible. They are convinced that \"losing\" will mean the end of the world.If I've been able to convince you of this, even a fraction, imagine how easy it is for insiders to convince themselves of this everyday. And imagine people that sure, that convinced they're right, ever going against anything they know, and revealing it? Not going to happen. The more we push, the harder they'll hold on and resist, sure of their goal. Like a dog a big stick.For outsiders, it makes no sense at all. Essentially, to regular people today, these folks are stuck in a WWII mindset. Talking to them with their obsessive preoccupations with secrecy and war, would be comical and impossible for regular people to understand. Maybe they're right. Or maybe we are. No one will ever know, as long as the wall between both sides remains in place.As long as this cover-up exists, the only thing we'll get is leaks and deliberate counterintelligence. I think Grusch is the former, and perhaps, he was merely the recipient of the latter. Who knows.The saddest part for me is witnessing the degradation of American democracy, where the government is held hostage by a select group while simultaneously blamed for the secrecy, forming a perfect smoke screen. In this war, our governments are merely puppets, used as a shield by these clandestine groups, and the people, consequently, are left powerless. This silent surrender to covert entities significantly diminishes the credibility of our rulers.0: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2xSFMkmWg41: A difficulty is a lot of what they say is true, mixed in with the lies that we have made any progress on understanding or re-creating, alien UFO technology at all. When the reality is we have no progress understanding or re-creating it at all. So contrary to what all these people say, we have no anti gravity, no advance energy or propulsion, we have no advanced medicine or med beds. However, the truth about consciousness assisted technology and telepathic contact and inter/extra dimensionality, and the existence of illegal beyond-black unacknowledged special access programs, and so on is mixed in with his lies. That mix is classic disinfo I guess.replymjan22640 root | Regarding ET specifically, it could be a species from Earth that became intelligent before humans did, it does not need to be extraterestrial. The assumption that we have good knowledge of Earth is incorrect, especially the deep ocean.replymjan22640 root | The object in the IR Tic-Tac video is colder than the environment.

To be dramatic, if the wrench was made with ore from a mine where your father worked, and he was killed and the ore was stolen, would you do business with the company that hired the mercenaries that killed him?

With unlimited fusion energy, room temperature superconductivity, and (soon) artificial general intelligence, the singularity won't be long off.replydekhn root | Yes, a combination of fusion, superconductivity, and AGI would indeed be transformative.

Things like generating novel code to solve a novel problem are not finding \"images within Rorschach blobs\". I think you should sit down with the technology and explore with a more open mind.replyAS04 root | Fusion would be massively boosted by having room-temperature superconductivity anyways.replymarcosdumay root | Well, if there is a breakthrough that puts us closer to fusion, it's room-temperature superconductors.replyTurskarama root | Careful with this logic, the same thing could have (and pretty much was) said 50 years ago about fission and microchips.replyboppo1 root | What fusion breakthrough is needed that isn't superconductors?replyIX-103 root | Computational electrodynamics.We need to design better geometries for reactors so that we can channel the plasma flow to better improve containment while quickly removing wastes from the highly compressed energetic region where fusion mostly occurs.

I’m sure the shortage of NVIDIA H100s and the demand for their APIs shooting through the roof has something to do with it. Perhaps they’ve switched to a quantized model? Who knows.And yes, LLaMA 2 is awesome. Progress is being made. But it’s slowed down. The novelty’s worn off. Now we’re lacking some fundamental plumbing to reach a useful AGI.If anyone cares, Bard is proving to be way more useful these days. Especially for research work. And Claude is bar none for document analysis.replydogcomplex root | What makes you think we're lacking fundamental plumbing? I am personally still quite convinced it will simply take a bit of time and development to plug in the current AI into sufficient self-testing structures (basically the next versions of AutoGPT) and let it run long enough to map out an entire domain with accurate measurements. Seems more like just a matter of time and a bit of funding - but mostly inevitable and very straightforward. It doesn't even really take GPT4 quality levels to do - that's just a bonus.https://twitter.com/fablesimulation/status/16813529041528504... These guys seem to be on the leading edge there - making self-referential character-driven narratives where agents talk to each other and build the collective world understanding, all through a South Park Westworld lolreplysheepscreek root | I completely agree with you. I failed to articulate it well.Like the current top HN post suggests (https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/), we’re still discovering patterns that work well with LLMs.That said, anecdotally - they already excel at being logic engines. Capable of filling in the gaps between instructions. Using their worldly knowledge or “common sense” to do so.But ever so often, they’ll miss an important bit. And I have to be quite involved to catch that. Kinda defeats the purpose. Here, I think we can benefit from supervisor LLMs. A second layer, whose sole job is to ensure the output quality. A QA bot - essentially.replydogcomplex root | Yeah with their own QA from a variety of different personas/perspectives/concerns/contexts I reckon you'll get a very decent accuracy - or at least self-assessment of inaccuracy. All these can ever do is propagate the data they know so far to the context/prompt you desire, but I don't see obvious limits there. And GPT4 is already a superb conversation partner as smart as nearly any person - so it's really like piecing experts together. If we run into any fundamental limitations from piecing these all together, it's gonna be the same limit that any group of humans trying to make a coherent/consistent organization of knowledge encounters, I think.Coincidentally, that appears to be how GPT4 was made - apparently it's actually about 8 personas with designated roles running GPT3.5 trained together (\"Panel of experts\"? there's an AI name for the technique). Makes you wonder how far that one trick scales.(P.S. great link. Gah - another long read on the todo list)replyuejfiweun root | Hey, who knows, it could just be a scaling issue. (The history of NNs would lend credence to this theory). In which case, if this room temperature superconductor stuff is legit, then maybe we're about to experience a major compute power leap that could result in AGI sooner than we think.replyrefulgentis root | It's not dumber.

The research into LLMs and diffusion models started to wake me up, but this superconductor research has, for some reason, really awoken something in me. I feel excited about the future– my future!– for the first time in a while. My zest for life is back in full force, I feel like myself again, and I've been very excitedly telling everyone I know!replyappplication root | That’s a tough run. Even if it’s a silly reason, any excuse to be whimsically excited about life is a good one.replyTuringTourist root | Once in a lifetime events tend to be \"Exciting\" to people, watching history unfold so to speak. The excitement comes from the awareness of this fact, and the fact that it might never be seen again.replyaqme28 root | \"May you live in interesting times.\"replyIshKebab root | When lockdown first happened it was exciting. Nothing like that has happened in most people's lifetimes.Of course it for tedious very quickly, but I remember going to the park and people being told not to sit on benches by police on horseback. How is that not crazy and sort of exciting?replygroby_b root | Emotionally, it was horrible. Societally, it was depressing to see that we'll never be able to tackle any true large problems, we can't even agree on wearing a piece of paper to protect fellow humans.But scientifically? Yeah, I'll go with \"exciting\". The field seemed to move at a tremendous speed, or at least that's how it looked to me as an outsider.Sequencing within less than a week, extremely rapid movement on the mRNA front (and really, the whole vaccination field - 200 candidates in 9 months), revamped understanding of aerosol transmission, leaps in rapid modelling, tremendous progress in terms of test development, growth in international collaboration, progress in the (public) understanding of chronic diseases, scaling up of wastewater monitoring, ...Definitely exciting.replyhcks This is sad man. You’re getting excited at manufactured hype on twitterreplysoVeryTired root | I think it's the videos of levitating samples that people are getting excited about. At this point it's either outright fraud (unlikely), an interesting materials science discovery that isn't superconductivity (most likely IMO), or superconductivity itself (still unlikely, but the balance of evidence is shifting).If it happens to be the latter, it's a huge scientific leap forward.replyaqme28 root | What makes this hype \"manufactured\"? I've been very hyped as well ever since I read the arxiv.replyXeamek root | On the contrary.Should he rather be excited about hype manufactured by entertainment or sport companies?

Thank youreplyxorbax root | 24 years is nothing in the scale of the universeIf it increases entropy as much as many suspect and it only took 1/3 of a couple humans' lives to open that phase space, the Universe has done what it wanted - to hasten heat-death.replyodyssey7 root | Interesting angle — but if heat death were possible it would have happened by now.replycthalupa root | Huh? Heat death of the universe is going to take an incomprehensibly large amount of time. Like, 10^106 years.The universe is A LOT younger than that.replyodyssey7 root | As Hawking once explained, “Since events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang.” When cosmologists talk about the universe and its age, it seems to me, as a non-cosmologist, that they’re using terms of art related to their models.Hawking’s explanation deduces that if the observable universe expanded from a singularity, we would be unable to meaningfully theorize what happened before then, since it would be beyond any form of observation to test the theory. Therefore, a scientific model rooted in observation can describe nothing earlier than the Big Bang.However, not everything unseen is untrue. If a singularity were to form somewhere in Andromeda tomorrow — in all likelihood, one will — we will still have existed today.Edit: The initial comment was meant as a lighthearted reply to the universe personification, but I ended up sensing a need to explain the reasoning.replyxorbax root | It's not \"personification\", it's the universe tending toward entropy increasing overall. I don't think I've heard anyone claim that heat death \"should have happened\" as an argument against it, or what it's supposed to mean in reference to the original post.There is a singularity in Andromeda, so I don't know why one forming mattersreplysoulofmischief root | Please read up on heat death before continuing to share baseless information.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universereplySargos root | Kwon is humanities' hero for leaking this knowledge to the worldreplycooper_ganglia root | Ultimately I'm glad that the research has seen the light, since I'm of the personal persuasion that there is no single scrap of science that should ever be done in the dark. All research, in a perfect world, would be entirely public and freely and easily accessible.With that being said, I'm not sure if leaking a paper and selfishly putting your name on it and excluding others so that you win a Nobel Prize doesn't exactly seem \"heroic\". Certainly beneficial for mankind, but it seems like a self-serving action.replyzarzavat root | The means justify the end. For all we know Lee and Kim would have sat on this for another year or more. I think that’s very understandable and I can’t fault them for wanting to be certain, given all the nasty things people have been saying about them, but the leak has clearly served humanity better than keeping it under wraps.replyyetihehe root | > but the leak has clearly served humanity better than keeping it under wraps.Yeah, advancing human knowledge serves humanity, but unfortunately not really those who are advancing that knowledge. Those with money will just use your invention and make more money, you will have a pat on the back. I wish it was more balanced, we would have a lot of inventions sooner and implemented faster.replyerulabs I’m very much a layman, but my understanding is that LK-99 itself is not necessarily a superconductor. It’s polycrystalline which means it’s a very uneven material - not all LK-99 is the same. They both didn’t know it was what it was and also couldn’t nail down the procedure for consistently making it so that it has the superconductor properties. It took a long time to get the resources required to investigate this far - the scientists had their own lives and careers and didn’t get back to this particular investigation until recently.replyjvm___ Uniformed opinion.It takes a week to bake/whatever a test sample. Which is why this is playing out so \"slowly\".So, they had an idea and have been baking/testing/refining samples for decades. Science and funding takes a while.What idea they started with and why they kept at it for 20 years is beyond me, that's a long time to chase an idea of you didn't have results or a hint that your idea would work. Maybe they had a weird sample that came from some other process in 1999 and have spent the intermediate time convincing funding people and doing the repetitive lab work required to get it to this point.replyxorbax root | I have the same thought: \"25 years? Why the fuck. Buy a new salt and publish a fucking paper.\"I suppose they saw something favorable in that 99 sample and nobody else knew. The vagaries of chemical synthesis helped.But it doesn't seem like they could have had a worse sample than what they fucking have now, while getting data that made them waste a quarter-century.As much as people hype and have 'reproduced' it, I...dunno. If it's real, the autobiography will be worth an expensive translation.replymptest root | Speaks to a supreme confidence in the theory, surely? I'm a layman but imagine everyone is going to want to hear every wild idea these guys could think up if this works out. They might have been sitting on this for 20 years?

I have a theory for new high performance heat engine which I developed over 15 years already, but I don't think anyone would give me ANY money for making a prototype (which may not work in reality), so I have to somehow do it in the limited time after working two jobs (I had to earn enough to have a home with a proper garage).

Thank you!This thread also describes WHY those LK-99 researchers sat on their invention for so long, they just couldn't find enough people interested in their material.Of course I could just publish my idea, but it's possible that no one would be interested in this and I would like to have some money from this to pursue some other ideas without begging people for support.replyxorbax 30 root | I think I'd ask you what I'd ask L/K - why do you think it works?They're experimentalists: they didn't find the material from first principles, they appear to have made it and decided to continue.So did you make the engine and notice it's efficiency, or did you find it using first principles where no one else did?replyyetihehe 16 root | > So did you make the engine and notice it's efficiency, or did you find it using first principles where no one else did?I found it from first principles, I still don't know why no one else thought about it, but it requires sort of splitting and reversing a normal stirling engine inside-out. Since then I've found several attempts at going in that directions which I took, but no one connected all those pieces yet as far as I know. This doesn't require any advanced materials, just a new configuration of existing inventions. For 15 years I've thought why it should not work, but I can't find a flaw in my reasoning, so now I need to verify it with actual working machine, because I know I still might be wrong. If I'm right - this will change energy generation and storage (no more steam turbines and will replace PV panels). If I'm wrong - someone will potentially lose about $10k.replyfnordpiglet There are various timelines on HN and elsewhere but it boils down to essentially they saw some blips on sample measurements that they assumed were errors. But the head of their lab thought differently and as he was dying asked his former students to reinvestigate it. They secured funding in 2018 but it was a bumpy road with personality conflicts etc.replyscythe >Assuming this is all true, why is it just now coming to light? Did they just not know what they had?This is why the calculations by Sinéad Griffin looked so interesting to me: they suggest that the superconductivity depends on an unconventional substitution pattern that might not (in fact should not) occur in most samples of Cu-doped lead apatite. So the active structure was only present in tiny quantities, requiring a long period of trial-and-error optimization.Again, this is far from proof, but I thought it was at least very curious to have some theory that explains not just a mechanism for superconductivity but also why the samples seem to teeter on the edge of superconductivity so frustratingly.The replies to my previous post ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36958419 ) suggesting that flat bands appear simply because copper doesn't belong in that lattice seem inconsistent with the fact that a flat band was not observed when copper substituted at the wrong type of lattice site. If flat bands appear merely because of the unpaired copper electron, they should appear when it is substituted only at Pb {2} sites, but they don't. The appearance of this band structure plus the observance of diamagnetism just takes us from happenstance to coincidence, so we need one more to conclude it is enemy action.FWIW I don't work in condensed matter physics but I have taken the classes at grad level a few years back. I also should really be doing other things, but this is probably the most fun scientific news cycle since 'Oumuamua at least.

Korean Cryt. Growth Cryst. Techn. {\\bf 33}, 61 (2023)] provides some experimental indications that Pb10−xCux(PO4)6O with x≈1, coined LK-99, might be a room-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure. Our density-functional theory calculations show lattice parameters and a volume contraction with x -- very similar to experiment. The DFT electronic structure shows Cu2+ in a 3d9 configuration with two extremely flat Cu bands crossing the Fermi energy. This puts Pb9Cu(PO4)6O in an ultra-correlated regime and suggests that, without doping, it is a Mott or charge transfer insulator. If doped such an electronic structure might support flat-band superconductivity or an correlation-enhanced electron-phonon mechanism, whereas a diamagnet without superconductivity appears to be rather at odds with our results.Superconductivity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperconductivitySuperconductor classification: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductor_classificationRoom-temperature superconductor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room-temperature_superconducto...Diamagnetism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetismreply 77 more comments...",

Hardware Hacker Mods An M1 Mac mini To Receive Power Over Ethernet Instead Of The AC Input By Jeffrey Morgan - August 1, 2023Apple has implemented strict software limitations in place to ensure that without the use of some ingenious modding, one cannot alter the way the company’s hardware works. A systems engineer and a hardware hacker decided to challenge himself and modded an M1 Mac mini to be able to run on the Power over Ethernet (PoE) protocol.The modding process required removing the Ethernet port from the M1 Mac mini and altering itTo get started, Ivan Kuleshov had to de-solder the Ethernet port on the M1 Mac mini and modify it so that the compact machine could support power delivery. To make this possible, Ivan states on Twitter that you will require a few components and a magjack connector. Next, he used an ‘off-the-shelf module’ as he mentions that the components can communicate with the PoE switch and convert the power supply to 12V.Ivan has said on his Twitter account that he plans to write the entire modding process in an article and upload it, but as AppleInsider has noted, it is possible that the M1 Mac mini running on Power over Ethernet has some limitations. This might be one reason why the hardware hacker has not disabled power delivery through the regular AC adapter, meaning PoE will likely be used as a secondary power source.Thanks to the power efficiency of Apple Silicon, the M1 Mac mini was the perfect hardware to test out PoE, as on idle, the device only consumes 6W. When some load is applied to the internals, that power draw can go up to 40W. After some thorough research, we found out that the maximum throughput of Power over Ethernet was 15.4W and that too over varying voltages, which are details that Ivan had left out when showing off his findings on Twitter.Thankfully, we will learn more about this modding process in the future. Hopefully, we will learn the limitations of PoE and see what other Macs with Ethernet ports can support this level of alteration.News Source: Ivan KuleshovShare this story Facebook Twitter source Previous article A future Android phone will finally have a rival to Apple’s Cinematic Mode Next article TicWatch Pro 5 Review: Best Galaxy Watch Alternative?

Some switches support up to 95W per port with PoH.replyOJFord root | Surely they're all 'up to'? It's not 'you must sink this much current or else not compliant'?It seems like a weird thing for TFA to say anyway - my PoE[+] switch was the cheapest 8 port I could get a few years ago on Amazon, and does 30W per port. I don't really understand how you could look into it at all, be willing to attempt the hack, but not use a switch (or injector or whatever) that's capable of powering it under load.replyjtriangle root | Depends. Within the standard, you can do 51w at the full 100m on standard cat6, which is 300ma/pair. If your runs are shorter, you should be good to go at the full type4 current, or, 960ma.This is a good reference for this: https://www.5gtechnologyworld.com/what-every-engineer-should... which goes into how to calc your total bundle dissipation and whatnot.replybitbckt root | Hah, yes they are all 'up to' on the device side. A switch port or injector is not compliant with a particular standard if it does not provide for the type-specific load, however.replydonw root | “By ‘Energy Star’ compliant, we mean that it burns as much energy as the sun.”replydev_tty01 root | They said it \"can support 60W.\" As you point out, Type 4 can support up to 71W, so yes it can support 60W.

Actual use cases are left as an exercise for the reader.replyWWLink root | Headless servers where you want a modular or easily removable battery backup.I really wish desktop PC power supplies would support such a thing. It seems stupid that we need to use a UPS with an inverter when the power supply should be rigged to accept DC input straight from a battery.replyjacknews root | Exactly, the PC PSU coverts AC to 12v for the PC anyway, so 12v batteries should slot into that scheme, without a separate PSU and inverter.replyconsp root | You would still need a DC to DC converter as lead acids deliver anywhere from 12.8 to about 10v depending on SoC and load.replyicehawk root | For anything larger than about 500W that'd become untenable because at 12V as you'd need cables that can carry in excess of 50A.UPS systems start connecting the batteries in series to provide higher voltages for this reasonreplyjacknews root | Or multiple cables, just as PC power supplies of 500w+ have, and in fact some of their power is delivered at 5v.replym463 root | Even more annoying is why aren't decent USB-only ups systems?just ditch the 110 outlets for usb-a or usb-c ports and skip the inverter.I'd love to power a pi or 3 from ups-based usb ports.replymatharmin root | Where I live, this is actually extremely common now - typically referred to as a \"Mini DC UPS\" [1].These cheaper ones just provide 9V and 12V output to power a fibre and/or WiFi router, as well as 5V USB-A, and start at around 30Wh capacity - some for less than USD 20. If you pay a little more, you can get 24/48V PoE included as well.Unfortunately, ones providing USB-PD are quite rare. You do get \"power stations\" [2] with USB-PD (in addition to an AC inverter).

I could've been a jerk and said just buy a UPS - this is an established concept.Edit: thank you kind souls for restoring the imbalance - carry on :DreplyWWLink root | Not really. However, as a long-time Mac and Apple fan, I can say the community has a lot of overly aggressive people who can't stand any criticism (valid or not) of Apple and will do various things in retaliation.replyNavinF root | No it just reads as kinda paranoid because li-ion cells typically become spicy pillows long after the device becomes obsolete. It's also trivial to avoid by limiting cell voltage. Many devices, most notably iPhones, automatically go into kiosk mode after charging for a few days for exactly this reason: https://support.apple.com/en-gu/HT208710replyWWLink root | Definitely disagree. My own anecdotal evidence is that many many laptops left plugged in 24/7 will develop a spicy pillow after a year or two. That includes a set of Apple laptops and hundreds of Dell laptops.replybravetraveler root | Thank you for taking the time to follow up!Definitely a bit paranoid - even if I'd prefer to call it robust :)I've had very bad luck in this regard... but haven't honestly used a laptop in probably a decade. I was pleasantly surprised to see my latest (dust-collecting) Lenovo will stop somewhere around 80%!Point being, sure - there are safety things... but batteries are consumables. I like these things to be easy-to-replace!I find these being difficult to replace accelerates this pattern of obsoleting. CPUs and (especially disks) tend to pack plenty of punch/life, these days - well beyond the mechanical/chemical things they depend on.Something to ponder - these chips may see particularly long use, being so power efficient.

Multiple cords don’t actually bother me but it sounds kinda neat.Anyhow I guess the goal is “because you can”replyOJFord root | I could see it making sense in a 'van life' context to use a smaller local battery rather than plug everything in to your main leisure battery. Use the latter to charge Makita packs say and then run most other stuff off those (there's a decent amount of open 3D printable adapters for them, as well as third-party/AliExpress stuff).replyGigachad root | Would make way way more sense to have a macbook that you can then charge direct from a DC battery over USB-C. With the mac mini you still have to work out how to power an external screen as well.replyvirtue3 root | There's a lot of low power HD screens out there. It's not super difficult. Not the ideal case for sure but low power is all about tradeoffs.replykposehn root | Battery aside, POE also allows you to put it anywhere you have ethernet cable with sufficient power delivery. In this case you could have a workstation powered entirely off ethernet delivered to the location (some monitors will also work with a POE splitter as well).replytyingq root | That it happens to be 12 volts DC has some value versus whatever power loss an inverter has for use in a vehicle. Though I'm with you on the relative ease of starting with a laptop instead.replysimlevesque 1root | > it seems less cost effective than just getting a MB Air and not using the screen...how ? why would paying for a screen and not use it be cheaper ?replyarcticbull 1root | Economy of scale, mostly.replycyberax root | E.g. to run home automation in case of a power outage.

I think I understand why backbone networks uses extremely high voltages to reduce losses, but at least for now think it is more a issue over long distances, but I am willing to reconsider.)replyforgotusername6 Plenty of domestic applications still require higher voltage (well actually power but I presume you aren't suggesting 12V with high current). Vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, anything portable that produces heat. Building houses with low voltage sockets would be really frustrating for people living there.Is the danger of 230V actually significant in this day and age? I wonder how many fires/injuries are caused by 230V that wouldn't happen at a low voltage.replyhunter2_ For a given wattage, voltage and current can be adjusted (inversely proportional) within reason, but higher current with lower voltage results in some problems: voltage drop (which mostly only matters at long distances, typically negligible within an office) and thicker conductors (double the cross-sectional area for double the current, if memory serves). This is why things like PoE and phantom power for audio are often 48V instead of something lower.replysbierwagen Many IP phones are PoE.Ubiquiti used to sell PoE office lighting, oddly enough. Now discontinued https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1431160-REG/ubiquiti_...replycrote Office equipment doesn't really have \"transformers\" anymore, everything uses switched-mode power supplies. The way they work, is that they have an output buffer (a capacitor or inductor) and rapidly turn a switch on and off to keep that output buffer at the right level: if the output buffer is below the target voltage, the switch closes and the voltage will start to rise. Once the output buffer rises above the target voltage, the switch opens and the voltage will drop as power is being used from the buffer. This happens thousands or even millions of times per second. This principle works exactly the same for modern AC/DC power supplies as it does for DC/DC ones.The problem with your plan is Ohm's Law, and more specifically that fact that wires aren't perfect and have some resistance (for now!). Ohm's Law gives us V=I*R, where V is the voltage in volts (V), I is the current in ampere (A), and R is the resistance in Ohm (Ω). In a wire, the resistance is constant, and V is the voltage loss across the wire. So how do we reduce the loss? We reduce I. Luckily we only actually care about the total power, which is given by P=U*I. If we want the power to stay the same and reduce the current, we have to increase the voltage.Let's say the two wires from our central transformer to the computer are 14-gage copper, and they are 100 feet long. Their resistance is about 0.5Ω combined. We want to power a 120W computer. If we transfer that at 12V (the normal voltage computers use internally), we'd have to transfer 120W/12V=10A. The voltage loss across our wires is 10A*0.5Ω = 5V! So we put in 12V, but get out only 7V as we burned 50W in the cable itself. To get out the desired 12V we'd have to put in 17V at 10A instead, or 170W to power a 120W computer. It would also mean supplying way too high of a voltage to a computer connected with a 3-foot cable.If we increase the voltage across the wires to 120V and down-convert that to 12V at the computer we'd only need to conduct 1A and the wire loss would be 0.5V, which at 1A is a power loss of 0.5W. That's completely acceptable, and because the computer down-converts anyways we don't really have to care about it getting 119.5V instead of 120V either.But now we are back with a power supply at each individual computer, so in the end we didn't really gain anything. Instead of an AC/DC power supply in every computer we now have a virtually identical DC/DC power supply, so what's the point? You might have some small gains by doing the initial AC/DC conversion centrally, but in practice it probably isn't enough to care. It is only really worth it when your power comes from DC anyways, like an office with rooftop solar.Alternatively we can use way thicker cables, but to get that same 0.5W loss at 10A would mean a wire with a resistance of 0.005Ω. To illustrate, that means using two 0000 AWG wires in parallel.replyAnimats root | Yes, that's the tradeoff. High voltage for the long haul, low voltage locally is common.There are computer equipment racks where distribution within the rack is at 12 VDC. These often have big busbars in the back, and a power supply in the base. Facebook's OpenRack started at 12VDC, but a later rev is at 48 VDC. That's just within the rack; there's a power supply in the rack base running off something like 3-phase 220VAC. There are advantages to running off 3-phase power; there's always power available from at least one phase, and the capacitors needed to smooth DC are far smaller.Telephone central offices have run the whole office at 48VDC for a century, with a big battery for backup power. Big bus bars carry that around the building. (Do telco offices still do that?)Much industrial control gear runs at 24VDC. So do many military vehicles. It's a reasonable voltage to send a few meters, but not hundreds.(The extreme case is ultra-high voltage DC power transmission, where power is sent thousands of kilometers at a million volts.)replyfree_energy_min root | Not op but thanks for the very detailed explanation!replymordae root | > Office equipment doesn't really have \"transformers\" anymore, everything uses switched-mode power supplies. The way they work, is that they have an output buffer (a capacitor or inductor) and rapidly turn a switch on and off to keep that output buffer at the right level...Overwhelming majority of mains-powered devices does, in fact, have a transformer. It is part of a switched-mode power supply, though. The only devices that do not have one are those that are fully enclosed in plastics and user can not under any circumstances come to contact with any of the conductive parts. Typical example would be a LED light bulb or wall-socket powered WiFi repeater (without RJ45 port).It is pretty hard to create a transformer-less device using plain rectifier/switch/capacitor topology. The biggest issues obviously are the high voltage before the switch and dead time when the mains voltage drops near zero 100 times per second. Most switch ICs made in the \"west\" cannot go up to 325V and are thus usually used with a transformer to step the voltage down below 60V. If you get a Chinese chip that can work off-line (as in directly with the 325V mains voltage), such as KP1063 , it still needs an inductor to bridge the mains dead time. This is incidentally done by the transformer in traditional power supplies. Capacitor would have to be huge to smooth over those for any significant power draw.> If we increase the voltage across the wires to 120V and down-convert that to 12V at the computer we'd only need to conduct 1A and the wire loss would be 0.5V, which at 1A is a power loss of 0.5W. That's completely acceptable, and because the computer down-converts anyways we don't really have to care about it getting 119.5V instead of 120V either.We could use 48V, which would bring the cable losses to about 3.3W (for those 100 ft). Or maybe instead of wiring from the mains box, we would place transformers along the wall sockets. Some new installations already do that and install charging USB ports. USB-PD is now specified up to 48V / 5A.I think that we are already seeing devices abandoning the traditional DC connectors in favor of USB. A lot more people now have a large bank of charging USB-A and USB-C ports on their desks. Some vendors already integrate them in extension cords. It won't take long for LED lamps to come with an USB cord and an optional mains/USB transformer SMPS (\"phone charger\"). Laptops are already charging (and docking) via USB-C with PD, it might not take long for screens to follow.Stepping 48V DC down to 12V, 5V, 3.3V is way easier and can actually work the way you have described above.replyabakker Transmission losses in DC are higher, so you need a lot more wire. You actually can get off the shelf low voltage lighting, though, but it tends to be high end designer stuff.replycesarb root | > Transmission losses in DC are higherFor the same voltage and wire size, transmission losses in DC are the same or lower (due to skin effect and capacitive/inductive losses). They are only higher when comparing low-voltage DC with higher-voltage AC, but the key difference is the voltage, not DC versus AC.(As a bonus, DC has lower peak voltage for the same RMS voltage, so the wires need less insulation.)replyIshKebab 27 root | Nah 12V MR16 lights are quite common.replybgentry 1The actual source referenced by the article appears to be this tweet thread: https://twitter.com/Merocle/status/1686093369322176512replymetadat 1> Thanks to the power efficiency of Apple Silicon, the M1 Mac mini was the perfect hardware to test out PoE, as on idle, the device only consumes 6W. When some load is applied to the internals, that power draw can go up to 40W.

This is important as transients from nearby lightning or occasionally even coupling to power cables can produce this kind of voltage. Ethernet connectors are magnetically coupled for protection from these transients.The problem with PPoE in these cases is, I think, not the voltage so much as the current. The continuous 24v supply may overheat the magnetic coupling transformer and cause it to fail. Some Ethernet interfaces, usually on telecom equipment and quality switches, have over current protection to prevent this. Unfortunately consumer devices usually don't.It's important to understand this because 802.3af etc. does provide power without being asked - as a rest for a characteristic resistance on the receiver. Otherwise it wouldn't know if a PoE-capable device was connected. Up to 20v can be applied during this process but it is time limited. In general, 802.3 PoE supplies must monitor the current usage of the powered device and cut off power if it is too high or even too low for more than a short period of time. This is in part to prevent this overheating problem on devices that might, for some coincidental reason, fall into the appropriate resistance range to activate PoE.In other words, 24v or even hundreds of volts for a few seconds is perfectly safe. 24v for minutes is likely to cause damage to devices without better protection than the spec requires. Old Ethernet equipment used to make the non-isolated components relatively easy to replace so that repairs after a problem like this were easier but now the isolation is a tiny surface mount part and replacing it will require tools and skill.replynumpad0 root | Looks like PoE uses pin 4 and 5 for +48V, and 7 and 8 for GND, which respectively are pair C and D of GbE. On ISDN, pinout could vary but one I could find said 1-2, 4-5 for V+ and 3-6, 7-8 for V-. In either cases, both sides of isolation magnetics are connected to pins of same potential and current is only proportionate to voltage imbalance within each pair which should be minuscule.I wonder if the problem is that 1:1 signal transformers for decoupling are being replaced with simple DC blocking circuit. That can be most simply done with a spare 0.1uF and an R10k per pin, which by the way generate load of from V/R=I 48V/10kohm = 5mA and 48V * 5mA = 230mW > 1/6W. That could cause resistor to burn off if phone-sized components would be used. Or if the cap might only be rated for 10V, it could burn open. I have nothing to support these hypothesis though. I could be entirely off.Also I suspect the \"passive PoE\" mentioned above could be cheap injectors with very rounded corners and always active 48V. Those are widespread for surveillance cameras and other neckbeardy applications.replysacnoradhq root | Most people don't realize the huge transient voltages in wires of any significant length that can be induced by nearby electrical storms.Granted, CAT 5-8 cables are supposed to be twisted pairs and sometimes shielded, but it's imperfect.PS TIL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litz_wirereplysomat 1root | Note that there are real 48v 802.3af/at power over ethernet devices where the power source has to assert that the power drain wants the power before it powers up and fake \"passive\" 24v systems where the line is always energized. probably where the GP got the injector from.My personal involvement on this was several years ago when I was going to buy several unifi access points. It turns out you have to be careful because many of the models advertise as being POE but in reality are jank 24v passive systems. I have not kept up with the current unifi lineup but at the time you had to make sure to get the \"AC Pro\" to have real 802.3af compatibility.replymmastrac 1root | I have a load of Unifi stuff here and it all supports active PoE, but works just fine with passive.

Ethernet is capacitively coupled which keeps you from having to coordinate your power/ground between devices. PoE is the recognition that if the DC levels don't matter because of that required isolation, we might as well not isolate in a power stage before the magnetics and deliver some DC power.replyhhh 1Merocle is also the creator of the Raspberry Pi Blade.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/uptimelab/compute-bladereplyvachina How about we take it a step further and carry data over power line?

Laptops aren't onboard because the problem of powering laptops is largely solved. Also...not many laptops have Ethernet ports.replycontingencies Historic energy consumption is probably higher than classically POE supported.Also, any length of POE run gets voltage drop, and POE switches and injectors often have tedious modal configuration based upon length of run and are designed with non-standard limitations such as maximum draw limits shared across multiple ports, which in aggregate will cause no end of issues. For verification, ask any experienced CCTV installer. These are exactly the sort of issues that cause users to take products back to their distributors.So it's a case of \"works in theory, PITA in reality, probable support and brand image impact huge, resulting priority zero\".replyJoeAltmaier root | It's really popular in factories etc, because it reduces cable runs I guess.replycontingencies root | That's right, but factories have other problems too: especially EMI due to huge loads being switched, which twisted pairs, shielded twisted pair and ethernet termination magnetics are designed to resist. Also, industrial cable routing can get pretty hairy, this means the ability to round a corner at a relatively tight radius can be important. Using standard ethernet cables for low current DC power keeps these concerns generally within acceptable realms of normality.replyhnbad The more direct problem in my experience is that all kinds of network devices that could reasonably be powered that way don't support it. My Fritz!Box router and repeater don't support it, my Sophos firewall doesn't support it (tho the Sophos XGS can supply PoE it doesn't seem to be able to be powered that way either) and of course the Hue hub and Raspberry Pi can't be powered by PoE either.replyjeffbee 1This seems to simply ignore the max continuous power rating of 150W.
