Very little impact. Is the problem PHP?I'm thinking of trying one of those plugins that convert the WordPress site to static web site. I'd imagine that'd have a big impact, at least for sites that don't need e.g. login, shopping carts, etc.replydgb23 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Is the problem PHP?PHP is fast for a dynamic language (compared to say Ruby/Python and even JS). It has the disadvantage that it gets slow by default the more code you have, because it has a static execution model.WP is extremely bloated and slow though. You can only make it fast by telling Apache to not execute it and hitting your cache (or with a caching layer in front).With heavy caching (flushed on data changes), hand written themes and plugins, modern build tools for frontend assets, image optimization etc. You can get get top metrics.However, that's just frontend. The admin panel is always slow.If your use-case allows it, you rather build one with something like hugo. Hugo and similar are very easy to use and net you much better results.My general tip is to not build websites with WP if you have web development skills.replymattbillenstein 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I worked on a Strattic conversion some time back - they basically scrape all your pages and serve them statically, but you do have to do some things to support search, forms, etc and you'll end up pruning plugins that don't work well with it.But, serving static pages is very very fast afterwards.replyphotomatt 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Bet on Moore's Law and go fully dynamic.replykhromov 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]WordPress is very fast out of the box considering all its capabilities, it's not hard to get in the range of 100ms TTFB out of the box on dirt cheap VPS servers, which is pretty good in my book. The problem is that people add very heavy themes and plugins that push them well above acceptable TTFB numbers.Full Site Editing with the new Gutenberg editor have amended a lot of that, it's very performant out of the box. Just as an example, I have a site averaging about 200ms for uncached requests, it has an FSE theme and 20 installed plugins, including heavy ones like ACF.This is all out of the box without cache, but by adding a simple static page cache (either a plugin or something like Fastly, Varnish etc.) you can make it so that the p95 latency drops by 80-90% because most people will see cached page views any way.replyxp84 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]First, seconding everything dgb23 said in this thread.I think if you don't have a need for that dynamic stuff, yes a static site generator is a slam dunk in my humble opinion.The PHP/Wordpress model where pages are composited dynamically for each pageview was an idea that made sense 20+ years ago. Whereas today, regenerating 1000 (or 10,000) static HTML pages can be done in a few seconds anytime a new blog post is made, giving up-to-date sidebars, homepage and stuff. Other code which needs to be dynamic can usually be fully client-side. And for comments, I don't think almost anyone uses the WP comment feature anymore. It's either off due to spam, or delegated to Disqus or similar. That, combined with the constant stream of WP 0-day exploits, really argues for having your actual WP instance behind your firewall and serving your files from an S3 bucket or plain Nginx (etc).replypacifika 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Redis or memcache plus a full page caching solution plug-in, mainly.replythomaslord 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The problem is the ecosystem. You can get response times for the main page down pretty low (especially with caching plugins) and the time to serve static assets is the same for Wordpress or a static site. Most likely if your site feels slow, the culprit is your theme and one or more plugins on your site. You can usually track down problem plugin(s) using PageSpeed Insights since their frontend assets are served from the plugin folders.replyrobjan 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Mine renders pages in under 50ms under BAU load and it's hosted on a $1/month cPanel.

To-date, I haven't found a way to control or limit this.But my post wasn't me complaining about my current situation - more about my despair at the lack of belt-tightening from certain platform vendors like Chromium - or in this case, why compiling to WASM instead of native results in this level of RAM usage.replyprojektfu 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]In like 1997 I was doing some work with a 5x86-133 with 24mb ram and a 2gb disk, running NT 3.51, MS SQL server, IIS and Visual Studio 4.

Every single database call and asset request happens on the client! (After you accept the several seconds of loading time.) I think it's also hilarious, because WordPress is probably the most-used MPA solution out there, but this basically turns it into an SPA. And it performs even better than most SPAs, because it doesn't need to do API requests to a server constantly.I also think the SPA parts of this (the post/page and site editors are very complex React applications) feel snappier in this demo than they do on my local dev environment. Really shows how good SPAs can be when you cut out server round trips.Disclaimer: I work for Automattic, and this has been a super cool experiment to watch.replyComputerGuru 13 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Really cool tech behind this demo!

It just run slower than 10 years ago.

Fast forward almost 20 years later and I'm a senior web developer, and my opinion of Wordpress has not changed. That doesn't mean Wordpress is bad, because on the surface it does its job very well, but it was (and probably still isn't) the pinnacle of well-written software, and it's not a coincidence that there were vulnerability reports being issues all the time for it.Wordpress was awesome in high school, the times before StackOverflow, MDN, YouTube, etc. It was a \"framework\" before frameworks were cool. One of the big selling points for Wordpress was that it was far more approachable than competing CMS softwares like Joomla and Drupal. I tried to figure both of those out back then, and I just utterly despised them.

There's a meaningful distinction between what is code and what is formatting because the concerns are quite different. This distinction is more apparent on frontend applications where the code bits are actually dealing with the fact that there's a single process doing all these seemingly asynchronous things, the use of very infrastructure-like components (eg: pubsub implementations, stores, etc). Formatting and design doesn't need to deal with the how, it needs to deal with the why. The powerhouse of a developer is knowing both.Trying to shoehorn peoples attitudes into discriminatory experience levels based on your perception of that rhetoric is an odd behavior unto itself. These topics merit talking about because ultimately they affect how we think, reason, and organize on different layers of projects.You actually somewhat proved my point with your example of CSS. It more recently became capable of more \"code like\" qualities, but it can definitely be used for just styling and formatting.

There's a reason we separate these activities in programming that has to do with how you model applications not to mention empowering the people who have expertise in doing them.While I agree that code|not_code is not helpful, trying to make the definition of code so low order that it's meaningless is also not helpful.

    "content": "Dropped iPad implicated in fatal Rotak Chinook helicopter crashBY ELAN HEAD | JULY 13, 2023Estimated reading time 6 minutes, 51 seconds.Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have demonstrated that an Apple iPad likely jammed against the co-pilot\u2019s left pedal prior to the fatal crash of a Rotak Helicopter Services Chinook in Idaho last year.The CH-47D operated by Rotak Helicopter Services crashed in the Salmon River during firefighting operations on July 21, 2022. NTSB PhotoThe Boeing CH-47D had been filling its bucket on a long line in the Salmon River on the afternoon of July 21, 2022, when it began spinning to the left. Eyewitness video captured the helicopter continuing its counterclockwise rotation as it descended and impacted the river just 13 seconds later.Although ground firefighters on scene quickly extracted the pilot, Thomas Hayes, 41, and co-pilot, Jared Bird, 36, from the water, both men ultimately died from their injuries.The NTSB has not yet released its final report on the accident, which will include its determination of probable cause. However, the newly opened public docket for the crash contains an \u201cExemplar Helicopter and iPad Examination Summary\u201d that details how investigators established the source of damage on the flight crew\u2019s iPad, which was recovered from the river with three distinct gouge marks and a bend from the back of the case toward the screen.Apple iPads and other so-called electronic flight bags (EFBs) have become common equipment in aircraft cockpits, used for flight planning, as a supplemental navigation aid, and to replace paper documents, among other purposes.NTSB investigators were able to align gouge marks on the accident flight crew\u2019s iPad with a sharp, vertical metal piece of the co-pilot\u2019s heel slide support assembly. NTSB PhotoNTSB investigators conducted their study using an exemplar CH-47D with a cockpit configuration similar to that of the accident helicopter. During the accident flight, the pilot was sitting in the left seat and the co-pilot in the right.Using auxiliary power to activate hydraulic assistance, investigators first pushed the pilot\u2019s left pedal forward, which resulted in the co-pilot\u2019s left pedal also moving forward. (Left pedal is used to commence a yaw to the left and/or stop a right yaw, and vice versa.)Investigators then placed the study\u2019s iPad between the left pedal and the airframe, next to the heel slide support assembly, on the co-pilot\u2019s side. When additional pressure was applied to the pilot\u2019s left pedal, the iPad fell and jammed between the left pedal and heel slide support assembly. That prevented the pedals from re-centering while also pushing against the co-pilot\u2019s left pedal adjustment lever.When pressure was applied to the pilot\u2019s right pedal, the iPad was squeezed in between the pedal and the heel slide support assembly. The gouges in the recovered iPad aligned with a sharp, vertical metal piece of the assembly underneath the heel slide.Additional right pedal input forced the iPad to apply more pressure to the co-pilot\u2019s pedal adjustment lever. Examination of the accident helicopter\u2019s wreckage revealed that the co-pilot\u2019s left pedal was at the forward-most adjustment setting, while his right pedal was at the middle adjustment setting.According to investigators, the accident co-pilot\u2019s height was five feet, ten inches. During the study, with seat restraints on and seats adjusted for comfort, neither a slightly shorter (5\u20197\u201d) nor a slightly taller (6\u20192\u201d) man could reach the iPad in its jammed position.Investigators demonstrated how seat restraints and the instrument panel visor would have prevented the co-pilot from quickly retrieving the jammed iPad. NTSB PhotoInvestigators also pointed out that the co-pilot\u2019s flight helmet would have further complicated any attempts to retrieve the iPad, as the helmet would have contacted the visor over the instrument panel.Andy Evans, director of the aviation safety consultancy Aerossurance, said that while operators are generally required to conduct risk assessments before adopting EFBs, there is often not an explicit requirement to consider the risk of the EFB as a loose object.\u201cHopefully this accident will prompt operators to have a long hard look at all possible loose articles in cockpits and robustly securing valuable tools and sources of situational awareness like EFBs,\u201d he told Vertical by email.CH-47D Chinooks: A formidable tool for firefighting missionsServo flap failure preceded fatal K-Max crashNTSB issues preliminary report for Hawaii helicopter crashThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has issued a preliminary report for the fatal crash of a Bell 206B JetRanger helicopter on Feb. 18 in Honolulu, Hawaii.",

If you drop something (FOD), there may not be a clearly defined boundary to where it can end up, or it may not be possible to see or get to it while strapped in etc. Rudder pedals, or the various mechanical and electrical connections around them, as indicated in the article, are a great example of this. If you can't find it, the AC may have to be grounded and thoroughly searched/panels removed etc.Military avionics may be missing basic things that an EFB can help with, including maps, nav point and airport databases, weather info, ADSB info etc. EFBs are (IMO) a poor substitute due to the FOD concern here, the clunky touch screen interface (which you probably have to take gloves off for), the risk of getting locked out of important things like checklist and plates by BlackBerry, Foreflight licenses, passcode timers or other security layer etc.You might have a jet that's 30 years old, just got retrofitted with a really nice radar etc, but the funding didn't make it through for a database, better displays/UI etc that would be better integrated with a jet, so you lean on the EFBs.There are sometimes EFB mounts that can attach to a canopy via suction cup, clip onto various surfaces etc.replyFabHK 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Near-crash due to dropped pen: Air show plane went into nose dive after loose pen in cockpit jammed the controlshttps://archive.is/YmIgBreplybbojan 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There was a helicopter crash in Canada due to an unrestrained tool bag: https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/local/ottawa/20...And this one in Ireland due to a rag: https://www.irishtimes.com/news/helicopter-crash-caused-by-c...replysph 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]FOD? EFB? Any explanation of these acronyms for people outside the US military?replykunwon1 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]FOD = Foreign Objects and Debris EFB = Electronic Flight Bag. A flight bag, traditionally, contains charts and checklists. EFB means you have a device that contains those documents20 years ago, I was an avionics technician on F-16 fighter jets in the USAF. We had 'FOD Walks' daily, which involved slowly walking down the flightline while staring at the ground, and picking up any loose objectsEven a tiny object, when ingested into a jet engine, can cause catastrophic damage. And F-16s have intakes very low to the ground, making them a much higher FOD risk.The worst FOD events were when something broke. We used bit drivers to remove aircraft panels, and the bits were fairly standard screwdriver bits. Sometimes, one of those bits would shatter when applying force to remove a stubborn fastener. If that happens, you have to retrieve every single piece of metal. If you return your toolbox at the end of the day and it is missing anything that can't be accounted for, the entire flightline could be shut down while a search is carried out.Dropping things in the cockpit could sometimes be much worse. If it drops down into a void left by removing a control panel, then it could potentially fall to the 'bottom' of the aircraft. If that happens, you'll be taking off all the panels in that vicinity, you'll have multiple people looking with flashlights, borescopes, etc.If something is dropped but can't be found, that's probably a multi-day event that will involve some fairly high ranking people.FOD was considered a serious threat, and a tiny piece of metal broken off of a tool could hinder operations for days at a timereplydredmorbius 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]A reminder that the fatal crash of Air France Flight 4590, Concorde on takeoff from Charles de Gaulle airport, France, in 2000 was due to tire debris on the runway:While taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport, the aircraft ran over debris on the runway, causing a tyre to explode and disintegrate. Tyre fragments, launched upwards at great speed by the rapidly spinning wheel, violently struck the underside of the wing, damaging parts of the landing gear \u2013 thus preventing its retraction \u2013 and causing the integral fuel tank to rupture. Large amounts of fuel leaking from the rupture ignited, causing a loss of thrust in the left-hand-side engines 1 and 2. The aircraft lifted off, but the loss of thrust, high drag from the extended landing gear, and fire damage to the flight controls made it impossible to maintain control. The jet crashed into a hotel in nearby Gonesse two minutes after takeoff. All nine crew and 100 passengers on board were killed, as well as four people in the hotel. Six other people in the hotel were critically injured.<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_4590>The debris was a metal strip \"435 millimetres (17.1 in) long, 29 to 34 millimetres (1.1 to 1.3 in) wide, and 1.4 millimetres (0.055 in) thick\", which had detached from a DC-10 which had taken off five minutes prior to the Concorde.replykunwon1 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It is my understanding that, after the loss of the Concorde, one of the resultant advisories mentioned an automated FOD detection system, which did not exist at the time.

My impression from the comment was that military cockpits were designed such that it was easier for stuff to get lost than it might be, tho, which is what I was curious about.replybitwalker 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I worked on F-16 avionics (in aircraft maintenance, on the flightline), there are a lot of little nooks/holes/slots/gaps where small bits of FOD can fall and be incredibly difficult to extract, and the fear of that FOD causing a jam, flying around the cockpit, or getting wedged and causing unexpected wear on wiring harnesses and then shorting out (or worse, arcing) during flight was a _big_ deal. FOD in the cockpit was basically the worst thing that could happen during routine maintenance, because if you couldn't see it, and either couldn't get to it with a magnet (or the FOD wasn't metal), it might require pulling _a lot_ of stuff out of the cockpit before you could reach into the area where it fell. The worst case that could easily happen was having to have Egress come out and pull the ejection seat so you could get under it.I always figured that all of those little gaps/etc. were due to a couple factors:1.) the aircraft are constantly being upgraded/modified, so even if you designed the aircraft to be gap-free initially, there will inevitably be changes that introduce them. The cockpit itself is basically a frame with racks that hold all of the avionics, seat, etc.2.) in conjunction with the above, ease of maintenance was somewhat important, so they tried to leave at least a little room to maneuver in the cockpit where possible (though there were plenty of places which were a nightmare to work regardless), but that comes at the cost of introducing areas where things can fall.3.) some components have to be regularly removed and worked on outside the aircraft, or must be free of obstruction during flight, e.g. the ejection seat. So you end up with plenty of gaps where things can fall.replyHumblyTossed 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Why would one waste money (and weight) building a cockpit that was more than just utilitarian?

Stuff comes apart.A general engineering design principle is that things degrade smoothly so that there aren't abrupt changes in performance.The aircraft controls should be protected such that foreign objects should have a low likelihood of jamming them. That there aren't things preventing someone from clearing any blockages and there aren't places where they could lever themselves in.My car has a design flaw with respect to the floor mats and the accelerator pedal (its not a Toyota). Between how the lever arm and the pedal surface itself are design and the aftermarket floor mat, if the mat slides forward it can jam the accelerator down. These are the deep groove mats for catching mud and water. The designers didn't think of this, if the pivot point for the pedal was further up the firewall. The pedal also has a hard square edge. Both of those things are in general a design flaw for pedals. The NHTSA (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration) should and maybe they have (my car is old) the design of the pedal linkage and the shape of the pedal to reduce this kind of risk. The hooks for securing floor mats should also be standardized to help keep them in place.The hard mount points for child seats are a great positive example of this.replycivilitty 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> The hard mount points for child seats are a great positive example of this.You're comparing child seats built for the greatest common denominator to high tech war machines that were built on the principle of \"kill or be killed\" for the best funded and most advanced armed forces on Earth.

All of that equipment is regularly worked on, removed/replaced, and so it is necessary that it be (relatively) easy to access and remove.The equivalent would be like if you had to pull all of the instruments, electronics, and seats out of your car every 1000 miles, clean them up, replace faulty bits, and then put it all back again. All of the fancy trim, carpeting, etc., just makes that job harder, so you would probably want a car that doesn't have any of that, and is designed to make doing that kind of work easier, better still if you can avoid having to remove everything, and only have to remove the bits individually that need to be maintained. The down side of course, is that without all of the fancy trim and stuff, there would be gaps where things could fall and be hard to reach, and holes where wiring travels to the engine compartment/trunk/etc. Of course, FOD presents way less of a danger in a car than it does an aircraft, so you might not care if you drop something there, but aside from that, I think the analogy holds up.replyr3trohack3r 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Depending on your definition of \u201csmall\u201d this is not true.

One passenger's restraint accidentally engaged the emergency fuel shut off lever, and by the time the pilot figured out what had happened it was too late to correct things and he was forced to land in the river.None of the passengers were able to cut the restraint to free themselves, and all five drowned.It's not really the same as dropped electronics but it's an example of a safety system gone awry.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_New_York_City_helicopter_...replypartdavid 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]For me, the aspect of that accident that never gets enough attention is the partial failure of the floats.I think everyone understands that asking people who have never drilled a helicopter water escape to take special actions in an emergency, let alone reach behind them and cut a tether, is just never going to work, certainly not in the few seconds they had. If the floats had functioned as designed, according to the investigation, everyone would have survived. Instead, either because the pilot did not fully activate them, or due to some malfunction, the right float did not inflate, causing the helicopter to capsize.It's not completely clear to me, but I don't think they ever completely identified the malfunction that resulted in this, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a malfunction in a safety-critical system that caused deaths, and I'm surprised it's not the primary highlight of this accident.replyfullstop 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Right, they would have had the time to remove the tethers if it hadn't sank.

The roaches and smaller spiders don't trigger any kind of involuntary reflex anymore. I do still flinch when the largest spiders (> 5 inch leg span) move very quickly while I'm doing maintenance but I'm pretty okay with that, especially because one of them could put me in the hospital.replyjacquesm 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> it's easy to imagine the poorer consequences had I been a little further in my journey.The wasp would have been fine.Makes you wonder how many cause unknown single vehicle crashes where the driver dies are the result of insects.replywhinenot 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Some people may view this scene[0] as overly dramatic, whereas I think it's perfectly understandable once it happens to you.[0]https://youtu.be/nJ_pVgV1EZQ?t=216replycamtarn 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I had a wasp fly into my motorbike helmet one time.

Although Charity wrote an extremely generous public announcement, I hesitated to talk about this new role for quite a while as I was figuring out the job. But since 2020, I\u2019ve noticed how little candid writing there is about paths to the VPE role or what the job is really like.* I understand why: the stakes for public comment become higher as you move up the ladder, every social media post has the potential to be interpreted as a subtweet or request, and your highest-priority work is often deeply entangled with confidential company and personnel matters. Nonetheless, I think it\u2019s useful to share what I can about my experience in the hope that it might encourage others to seriously consider this role, especially those from backgrounds, identities, and genders poorly represented in the VP of Engineering ranks today. VPs of Engineering often have a lot of influence over both company culture and policy, and the decisions our companies make ripple outside of the companies themselves. The whole tech industry would benefit from more perspectives in this role.Not the planI didn\u2019t join Honeycomb with the goal of becoming an engineering executive. I joined to be an engineer (employee ~12), with the understanding that I might go back to a management role when there was a need. I had enough experience at early-stage startups to know that, if the company is successful, you\u2019ll probably do a whole host of things as the company moves through different phases. Being attached to a particular job was more likely to be a hindrance than a help to either my success or the company\u2019s. I was curious about moving up the engineering management ladder eventually, but I assumed a VP opportunity would be out of reach for a long time, if ever. Instead, I joined Honeycomb because the team seemed incredibly smart and kind, I thought I would learn a lot, and the product seemed like something I\u2019d wanted at past jobs but could never find. Happily, all these things turned out to be true and are still true to this day. If you hope to grow into a specific role sooner rather than later, I suspect joining a startup at a later stage (series B+) might be the most efficient route. Nonetheless, I loved joining Honeycomb at series A, even though it has meant working through some of the wandering-in-the-desert phases of the company. (I\u2019ll save writing about those for my post-IPO Honeycomb screenplay.)The pathIn the early days of the company, co-founder and then-CEO Charity Majors managed basically everyone, from execs to individual engineers. In what was mostly a happy accident, Charity and I turned out to be philosophically aligned on most things management, and I have long admired how her insights shape many conversations in our industry. However, we have fairly different backgrounds and skill sets. While Charity has deep experience in the domains of infrastructure & operations, databases, and backend engineering, I come originally from design, frontend, and product engineering, and I take a particular joy in collaborating with product management and ux design. We share a lot of experience with metrics and monitoring technologies, although she kind of despises them and I feel a profound affection for them. I\u2019m also a rules and process person \u2014 my daily work and even my hobbies often revolve around planning things and managing risk \u2014 whereas Charity has a more intuitive, spontaneous style, often shines brightest in a crisis, is allergic to checklists, and is quick to spot when things aren\u2019t working, including when a particular rule or process isn\u2019t serving us.As Honeycomb grew and the management workload within R&D increased, I was able to load-balance more and more management work with Charity, usually picking up areas where the work matched my background better than hers. I wish I could call out specific milestones on the path, but the truth is it was done in a thousand small steps. A few title changes along the way were useful backward-looking markers of progress, but they didn\u2019t often denote major changes in scope beyond (usually) new meetings to attend.If a startup is growing, there are always new gaps in processes & responsibilities opening up, quickly going from tiny pinpricks in the dam to major leaks of time & attention. There are always new problems to level up on, if you\u2019re willing to lend a hand with whatever comes up. But to give credit where it\u2019s due: it\u2019s natural for startup founders to look for ways to get more out of their team, and yet it doesn\u2019t seem to be as natural to recognize successes by granting new titles and roles. I have seen both of Honeycomb\u2019s co-founders support this enthusiastically, both for me and for others at Honeycomb, and it is a rare and lovely thing. If I went looking for another startup to join at some point in the future, I would specifically look for an exec team or founding team that could cite examples of building up high performers for internal promotions \u2014 and swiftly recognizing and rewarding those already having impact outside of their role-defined scope.In retrospect, the most interesting transition along the whole journey for me was probably moving from managing only ICs to also managing managers. I\u2019ll write more about this another day, but I would encourage anyone hoping to make this leap to do it at a company where they already know the team, technology, and business problems, rather than moving to a new company to try it out. While many of the line management skills I already had translated over, it nonetheless took me quite a while to learn how to effectively \u201csee\u201d the whole organization (and especially where there was friction or where we might need more support) through an additional layer of management. My prior first-hand experience with the people and problems in engineering tided me over until I could work with my managers to build the practices and skills to assess what was happening on my teams effectively.As Charity mentioned in her blog post, at a slightly rocky point in the company trajectory, we did also explore hiring a VP of Engineering from outside the company. I was grateful that Charity was upfront with me about considering this, and that she invited me into the process of finding and selecting the right person. We talked to a handful of extraordinary engineering leaders, some who didn\u2019t feel like quite the right fit for where we were at, and some who decided we weren\u2019t the right next step in their journey. And then one day we realized we had a fresh new batch of problems to think about, and the old problems that seemed intractable had become\u2026 more tractable. I didn\u2019t get promoted right then (it wasn\u2019t the right time) but we also stopped looking for an external hire. Nonetheless, I think we were all glad we went through this process. Above a certain level, leadership promotions have to be about what the company needs, not the individual, and it was valuable to imagine together what a great VP of Engineering for Honeycomb might look like.How to prepareWhile I didn\u2019t see myself on the path to VP when I joined Honeycomb, in hindsight I can see some traits that helped me become a fit for the role:Holistic thinking. My focus naturally tends toward how to make Honeycomb the company more successful, not just my teams. I thrive where I am rewarded for acting in the best interests of the whole company, not my department, team, or self. (This is more often the case at startups than at large companies and part of why I gravitate toward early stage businesses.)A generalist streak. I find basically all business problems and domains within a software company interesting, and I have always loved that startups let you see how all the pieces fit together. I also don\u2019t mind taking on unglamorous work outside of the spotlight when needed.Happiness at varying levels of abstraction. I can work at many layers of abstraction and can quickly pick up concepts of a higher-level layer without needing to grok the layers below \u2014 but I also enjoy getting into the weeds when it makes sense.An overgrown sense of responsibility. I have a bad habit of walking into a room with five problems and walking out owning six. This is helpful at a startup where lots of important work falls into gaps between functions. However, it needs to be counterbalanced with a constant effort to wrap up or hand off jobs to others to avoid getting bogged down or stifling the growth of the rest of the team.A knack for systems thinking, paired with equal interest in both human & technological systems. I believe this is a super common and normal thing but have had at least one great coach insist that it is not, so I\u2019m putting it on the list. A genuine joy in seeing teammates level up. As a manager, nothing brings me more energy than finding a match between a person ready to take their next step and an important problem at the edge of their abilities that needs to be solved \u2014 and then building the plan to help them do it.Good relationships up, down, and sideways. People all around the company had to be more excited to have me in the job than to roll the dice on an external candidate. These work experiences also helped me out:Working at other startups of a variety of stages and sizes, especially B2B SaaS startups. B2C and B2B startups often deal with relatively distinct categories of problems and have each cultivated their own techniques for solving them. It\u2019s good to see both sides at some point. However, there\u2019s a lot of value in specializing in either B2B or B2C. The go-to-market motions, org structures, engineering problems, and scaling challenges you\u2019ll see at a B2B company often will differ from what is popular in the B2C world; it\u2019s useful to know the common patterns for the type of company you\u2019re at. Working across the stack. While my engineering experience is deepest in frontend technologies, I am very grateful to have built early experience in a number of shops that did pair programming and brought a DevOps mindset to their work. I was able to learn from great backend, infrastructure, platform, and ops engineers and get a sense for both how they thought and what problems were important to them. (It delights me that two of the engineers who taught me the most, Eric Saxby and Blake Irvin, are now regular Honeycomb users who I bump into sometimes in our community Slack.) While you don\u2019t need to be an expert in every area of engineering to be an engineering executive, a little empathy and high-level domain understanding across all your teams goes a long way.Having experience in the dev tools and monitoring space; being a tools nerd. I\u2019ve worked for three dev tools companies in a row, and I have a hard time imagining doing something else. I genuinely love the Honeycomb product and feel great affection for many other products in the observability, monitoring, and dev tools space. My knowledge of our domain and enthusiasm for these tools can be useful to my colleagues and be a source of energy when we otherwise might get discouraged.An element of luck and a great teamDespite the long preceding section about how to prepare for this role, there was a lot of luck involved in being the right person for this role at the right time.I\u2019ve talked about how Charity\u2019s complementary skills and experience were part of what made me a fit for this role, but that\u2019s not the whole picture. I was also able to take on the job because we had a deeply experienced team of early senior ICs who had key engineering challenges more than handled, especially Ben Hartshorne and Ian Wilkes. VPs of Engineering from frontend backgrounds are relatively rare, and it\u2019s partly because the most pressing technical challenges a startup faces are often around scaling, reliability, and backend architecture. If we had been dealing with nonstop incidents, constant struggles with scaling, and major architectural challenges with our query and storage engine, someone with deeper backend and operational experience likely would have been chosen for the job, not me. Because of Ben, Ian, and other incredibly talented ICs on our team, and some of the solid design decisions the founding team made that bought us a lot of technical runway, these concerns were not top of mind for our leaders. Goals like executing well against our product strategy and leveling up our user experience were instead the concerns of the day, and there I could be more helpful. Our executive team also already had some accomplished, seasoned external hires within our go to market functions. Even the execs you might describe as company-grown leaders (Christine and Charity) already had founder or leadership experience from prior companies, and Charity was well-known as a talented manager long before starting Honeycomb. If the exec team had tilted more heavily toward new execs or those promoted from within, there might not have been space to grow one more exec into their role, which takes both months of runway and patience from other leaders on the team. I\u2019m very lucky to have had such a strong crew of exec peers who generously shared their wisdom with me as I stepped into the role and extended some grace as I figured it out.ConclusionThe most important thing I learned in hindsight is that the right VP of Engineering for a company is contextual. Before Honeycomb, I would have thought I could list off a set of canonical traits that make a great VP of Engineering. Sure, some roles might call for a larger helping of one strength or another, but I thought the basic template would be unchanged from company to company. This is much less true than I first thought.Generally, the same basic things need to get done in most software companies, but the shape of the executive needed to guide those things can change dramatically depending on the current set of problems for the organization and who is already there, whether exec, manager, or IC. And once you\u2019re in the job, the requirements also don\u2019t stay static, especially in a growing company. The role may morph and shift over time just as other startup roles do.Read part 2 now: On Becoming a VP of Engineering, Part 2: Doing the Job*Camille Fournier\u2019s The Manager\u2019s Path is one good exception to this.

The spacecraft is designed to explore the south pole of the moon, which has water reserves that could help make a permanent lunar base possible.The Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s Chandrayaan-3, which takes its name from the Sanskrit word for \u201cmooncraft\u201d, took off onboard a Launch Vehicle Mark-III rocket from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh at 2:35pm, local time, on 14 July.The preceding Chandrayaan-2 mission ended in failure in 2019 when a software glitch caused the lander to crash into the surface of the moon. The Vikram lander carried on that mission was meant to deploy a six-wheeled rover named Pragyan that would have explored the moon\u2019s south pole, but both were destroyed on impact.AdvertisementThe earlier Chandrayaan-1 mission consisted of a lunar orbiter and a probe designed to deliberately hit the moon at speed, again targeting the south pole. That mission was a success and made India the fourth nation on Earth to leave its flag on the moon.To date, only the US, the USSR and China have successfully landed lunar missions intact. A private attempt by a Japanese start-up in April ended unsuccessfully when it, too, crashed into the surface at speed.Read more:Return to the moon: Why are we restarting human lunar exploration now?Sign up to our Launchpad newsletterVoyage across the galaxy and beyond with our space newsletter every month.Sign up to newsletterChandrayaan-3 will be a repeat of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, but this time there will be no orbiter, with the lander and contained rover instead handling their own communications with Earth without the need for an intermediary satellite. The mission will arrive at the moon on 23 or 24 August, according to officials. The lander will then detach and drop out of orbit towards the moon\u2019s surface.

Similar to India today, the US in the 1940-1970 period had an industrialized half (the North, Midwest, and Western US) and less industrialized hinterland (Appalachia, South, Southwest).A major component of America's development was because of massive industrial projects targeting Appalachia, South, and Southwest America (eg. TVA, Space Grants, NASA Huntsville, Interstate Highways) along with the expansion of the social safety net (eg. Great Society, War Against Poverty, Civil Rights Act, LBJ's entire domestic policy)India is seeing a similar transformation via large industrial projects and an expansion of the social safety net via welfare programs/yojanas/\"freebies\".This can be seen starkly with Rajasthan (INC run) and Gujarat (BJP run).

As compared to other difficult to break in industries (Chips, Hi-tech agriculture, Genomics), India is actually well situated to break into the aviation industry successfully.replykylehotchkiss 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I think India will succeed in its space ambitions. I hope this one makes it! But aviation in general, not as much. China doesn\u2019t have the ability to make engines for its own commercial airliners yet. India doesn\u2019t have the industrial capacity to build the airliners themselves right now. HAL can build a few but India still depends on Russian jets.Air India going private isn\u2019t a sign of success in the industry. The government ran in into the ground, it got purchased without much of that debt, and the Tatas have limits to how quickly they can remove the tenured \u201cgovernment job\u201d bureaucrats from the system. The government is still doing air India major favors by heavily restricting access to Indian passengers by foreign airlines (just this year they denied emirates an upgrade from 50000/seats a week, and denied a United/emirates codeshare agreement). This ends up hurting them too since they are limited to 50000/seats a week. One place I will give Indian aviation major credit is the air traffic upgrades they\u2019ve done over the past 20 years.

But the actual \"trap\" is being stuck in value chain. If one use that metric, PRC is LONG PAST middle income \"trap\", apart from US, PRC has relatively complete chain across broad spectrum of sectors in the world. Third place is not even close. The question is really what if even being competent and productive at everything simply is not sufficient to uplift everyone because base population is so massive. There's an upper bound on how many high skilled talent economy can support.The yes part is being stuck in \"middle income\", which if you look at world bank revised 2024 high income range is 13,846, PRC 2023 projection is ~13,500, it's basically there, almost inevitable with a few more years of even modest growth even if threshold keeps getting revised up. And if you think PRC is massively lying about population like some demographers (-200m people) then PRC's been high income for a while.The real question behind these \"middle income\" rhetoric with respect to PRC is can PRC reach advanced economy levels of high income, and the answer is unlikely because again there's simply too many useless people, 600m+ living on less than $2000 who got left behind by modernization that will drag the per capita stats down until they die. On the other hand they will be the first to go since cohort skews old. Let that stats settle in for a second though, ~40% of population contributes about 5% of economy. Once they start dying (2050+) PRC per capita will start trending towards advanced economy with high % of skilled people wages because PRC population with start reflecting composition of advanced economy without 200m+ farmers and 100s million more low skilled people stuck in informal economy. It's why Xi's China dream only targets modest 40k per capita by 2050 (I think in PPP terms). BTW even PRC demographers realized in 80s that PRC was trending towards old before rich, the entire will PRC get rich before old is western rhetoric. And TBH relative to PRC demography plan (one of the few examples of actual PRC long term planning) - PRC currently doing about expection.>You do not grow like your teens and 20s in your 40s and 50s.This is simplistic. A society with 25% skilled labour is going to grow differently than one with 60-80% (advanced economy). PRC is former, trending towards the latter. She's spitting out OECD combined in STEM talent per year, and even with 20% youth unemployment that's stupid amount of talent to improve productivity. The TLDR is PRC is in process of building 5x-10x the amount of skilled talent that pushed the them to 15T economy. It's the greatest high skill demographics divident in human history, even if net demographics will decline. The question is where will that get them? Advanced economy income? My guess is no, but will actually happen is PRC talent will increasingly compete and take pie from high income economies, and wages will start to converge. PRC will get modestly richer while advanced economies will start to get poorer.On India, I think they'll be a much less successful PRC. Eventually they'll get there, i.e. they'll escape the middle income trap in the sense they will probably be able to competently develop most sectors indigenously - they won't actually be \"trapped\" by developement. But their sheer population 1.6B+ will likely trap their per capita by denominator of having so many unproductive people - India demographic divident is happening among their states with bad HDI. Nevermind unemployed STEM in PRC, their youth unemployment rate is like 40% (which western MSM doesn't seems to talk about) while being also being less educated with what talent they do generate being highly suceptible to being brain drained.

That said, policymakers in the PRC know this and have been working with SIEPR at Stanford for over a decade on rectifying this at a policymaking level, but there are some very real systemic issues that mean China c. 2023 cannot be compared with countries at a similar levels of development such as Brazil, Thailand, Mexico, Malaysia, etc.[0] - https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/trackin...replydirtyid 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, it's questionable if the context is per capita. But with PRC pop denominator effect, it's fine/prudent to also recognize absolute effects, the trend of PRC talent generation that bias towards skilled individuals means PRC will accumulate historically unprecedented pool of skilled talent over next 20 years since they have pipeline of 10-14m new birth for past 26 years for accessible future tertiary talent. Unless CCP completely cracks down on educating their population, with rate of current tertiary excess capacity and even if bodies get redirected into skilled vocational training, the country is trending towards ~100m new skilled over next few decades. Which assuming PRC has ability to retain and coordinate (and so far they've done reasonable job), that cohort is very much potentially the best/greatest pool of (TBF potential) high skilled demographics divident humanity has ever assembled in a generation period. Like there simply isn't any time period in the past where one country had population or institutions to do so, nor are any countries likely to match including US who would to increase immigration to politically unfeasible levels, or (IMO) India even with 1.6B pop unless they manage to not only stop crippling brain drain but also coordinate talent domestically on par with PRC capabilities. Hence PRC human capita can be per capita lower but also in aggregate better than virtually all other countries, including potentially US + immigration. Hence why c 2023 no one seriously thinks Brazil, Thailand, Mexico, Malaysia are currently or even potential future US competitors, while PRC with poor per capita education metrics is acknowledged as more than enough to be, because for some purposes, the more useful comparison is absolute vs relative.E: And in agreement, yes there will be macro level issues to low per capita performance - it's not going to be pretty but it's not going to be collapse either.

The leadership in post-2011 China has unnecessarily antagonized Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Phillipines, India, Australia, and Vietnam despite all those countries preferring to the neutral in any US-PRC confrontation.All the hawkish comments on here hoping for the collapse of the PRC are disgusting and do not reflect what those of us in a decisionmaking capacity or adjacent to those think.Yet unbridled nationalism and hubris by commentators on both sides is impacting the ability to get shit done.> Like there simply isn't any time period in the past where one country had population or institutions to do so, nor are any countries likely to match including US who would to increase immigration to politically unfeasible levels, or (IMO) India even with 1.6B pop unless they manage to not only stop crippling brain drain but also coordinate talent domestically on par with PRC capabilitiesIndia in 2023 is a country with developmental indicators, institutions, and infrastructure largely on par with the PRC in the 2000-2003 period.A lot of the same problems you mentioned about India are the exact same problems China faced and overcame, and the same playbook is being applied there.In fact, the same kind of commentary you are bristling too is the exact same commentary people used to give China during the exact same time period, and it's kind of funny seeing Chinese commentators reusing the same comments we Americans made about China in the 2000-2015 period on India.> A country can simulatenously improve/lead at top while bottom languish/declineThis is a still an open question. No country has ever transitioned from a developing country to an advanced economy with as crippling a Human Capital Handicap as the PRC today. The last large upper middle income countries that had a similar handicap were Mexico, Brazil, T\u00fcrkiye, and Malaysia.None of these countries are shitholes, but when they reached a similar pivot as China did today in the late 90s/early 2000s, they had the need to resort to extensive social and economic reforms. While Malaysia has succeeded at that, this hasn't been as successful in Brazil, T\u00fcrkiye, and Mexico.If I was a gambling man, I'd lean towards assuming this transition will be a protracted affair. Not \"institutions collapse\" bad but 7-10 years of malaise, because building human capital takes time and effort.replydirtyid 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Or because those countries baseline size means their natural growth trajectory will not threaten western incumbents the same way PRC growth would, including modest 2% military budget which is enough to make everyone shit bricks. Nor would I characterize those countries as \"largely\" aligned with LIO seeing current headlines and it's not like India doesn't antagonize neighbours when PRC started spread influence in south Asia.Difference between RU and PRC is RU actually mired in kinetic war with neighbours vs PRC grey zone that pushes region to some security hedging but not at expense of PRC trade. IMO that's natural/forgone, and let's not forget PRC antagonism was rarely PRC initiated. SKR over THAAD, Japan was always weary. PRC also last to reclaim/militarized SCS started by Vietnam (barring Brunei) but doing so at PRC scale revealed gap in capability causing others to hedge and they still do. Current US posture in region under Trump and Biden admins still pale in comparison to initial deterrence proposals of ringing PRC with missiles and agile basing. AU is AU they couldn't stay neutral if US pushed. But overall current US posture is still shadow of what they thought they could get despite going HAM on diplomatic efforts.On India, note elsewhere I said I'm optimistic they'll get shit together eventually but unlikely to replicate PRC because they lack same levers for state capacity. It's not unreasonable to observe India does not have the same favourable headwinds as PRC in 2000s, i.e. PRC+1 is mostly shifting to where PRC willing to shift and that's ASEAN not India who is unlikely to capture PRC levels of manufacturing base and ability to snowball development for the simple reason that PRC is not willing to relinquish manufacturing advantage and west can only shift so much. The fact that India is at PRC early 2000s indicators despite starting with comparable if not favourable conditions and still not addressing some of the major social hurdles PRC has mostly addressed at the time (i.e. single language to facilitate migrant / labour transfers), reflect inherent inefficiencies that is relatively more difficult to coordinate around. India on par with PRC in 2000 is still India 20 years behind due to systemic differences that extrapolated will unlikely see India catch up at 1:1 time scale.And yes consensus in washington was OPM fair game but PRC industrial espionage that pushed up PRC industry to compete with west was the real concern. Entire MIC2025 drama. And circling back to India this is exactly why they're not squeezing the level same tech transfers PRC was able to because everyone wised up. The playbook doesn't work as well anymore. US willing to cripple JP semi despite JP being fully LIO aligned, ultimately no one is going to want India to repeat a PRC including the PRC. Nevermind studies showing export oriented models working increasingly less well - countries milk industrialization opportunities faster and settle at lower levels of income due to labour saving technologies that remove a lot of human potential from being realized. Will India make it? Again IMO, yes, but it will take longer and the race against Indian demographics much more difficult. PRC \"only\" saddled with 600m farmers and informal economy \"halfwits\" despite deliberate family planning policy to mitigate, India will likely have 1B+ having tried and fail family planning of their own, that's another tier of drag to govern around.>No country has ever transitioned from a developing country to an advanced economy with as crippling a Human Capital Handicap as the PRC today.Sure but PRC doesn't need to be advanced across the board it needs regions to be sufficiently advanced to compete with advanced economies and by and large it already has at the scale of tier 1/2 efforts. PRC isn't a large country - it's a massive country the scale dynamics operates differently than turkey mexico or malaysia. At PRC scale, 5M STEM per year is enough to saturate/build up strategic industries with talent and directly challenge advanced economies across the board vs 100,000s of from \"large\" countries that still has to pick and choose. I'm one of the first to note PRC isn't going to uplift everyone to advanced indicators but it will uplift enough to be extremely competitive and resulting in advanced economies also suffering malaise (which many already are) by spreading out the pie. Convergence is as much about PRC doing better but also incumbents doing worse because they need to compete with segements of PRC that can compete. And that segment set to massively expand in next 30 years while current level is already competing/leading in industries with historically dominant western share. Time and effort has been put in via initiatives in 90s and early 00s and we're approaching divident reaping phase. There's a decent report on PRC leveraging scale in domestic efforts and eventual effect on oversea share of incumbents and effect was something like 50-90% reduction in operating margins of leading (mostly western companies) when PRC pushes surplus abroad. Hence why PRC competitiveness at even current PRC scale enabled by low % per capita skill is making advanced economies justifiably nervous.replyotikik 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]According to Goldman Sachs, which sometimes fumbles their bold predictions:https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/01/24/goldman-sa...replypaxys 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yet will continue to be among the worst in the world in all per capita metrics.

Each of these require people to learn these things at a very high level. Local firms must learn to manufacture complex components at high tolerances, universities must produce graduates who are good enough to tackle these problems, government departments have to build the expertise to manage these projects. Forming even more of a broad base of the pyramid.Once you have built the rocket, all this expertise doesn't just go away.

I personally struggle with that format, and tend to only use Discord as a messaging app for small groups of friends.

Parallel universes and all the lore around them are all caused by just a 16-bit integer wrapping inside the floor check code.

I pointed out a simple \"huh thats interesting\" observation and you just want to debate me.I think if they weren't rationalizing they would explain the concept as is - its a wrapping coordinate. I do agree they understand what is happening low-level and that it is a wrapping coordinate. They still choose to use this parallel universe explaination for ease of understanding and explainability to outsiders. A rationalization is just \"the action of attempting to explain or justify behavior or an attitude with logical reasons, even if these are not appropriate\" which sounds exactly what the PU explaination is. There is no derogatory insinuation or anything involved here.replyDylan16807 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm not trying to be combative.

I remember some glitches in Sonic the Hedgehog 1 through 3 I called \"The Valley of the Shadow of No Background\" and \"The Valley of the Shadow of No Sprites\". The latter of which was caused by an integer coordinate wraparound that caused the game to draw the tile map scenery from your location modulo N, but not populate it with game objects because the coordinates didn't match. As a result, things like loops only half-worked, and the corkscrew things from Emerald Hill Zone didn't work at all -- because invisible objects triggered the movement mechanics specific to those scenery bits.reply1coopdog2 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I love this video.

In a live setting commentators might briefly explain what a 0.5 A \"means\" but without this explanation to head off questions you'd likely have about why they care.replydfxm12 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Because Mario64 doesn't care about releases, the runners don't distinguish releases, you can always choose not to release A and so if you're doing this run (fewest A presses) you would only ever release in order to press A againJust reading this, it doesn't make sense to someone not familiar with the game why you wouldn't only hold A the last time you press it. It also has to be noted that holding A makes Mario do different things from not holding A.replyKwpolska 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]To be more precise, the game sometimes expects you to press A, but sometimes it's enough for A to be held for the action to happen. You can press A and not release in the first case, so that the second one can leech off it.replyhoherd 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Because Mario64 doesn't care about releasesIs that really true though? If it cares about holding, such as in gliding in the air, then it necessarily cares about not holding, such as being in the air but not gliding, and the way to transition from being in the air gliding to being in the air not gliding is to release.Is that wrong? I've only ever played M64 for like 5 minutes, but it's been on my list and I keep urging my children to get into it as a way for me to find the time to get into it too.replyhn92726819 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I could see how this could be confusing. SM64 does distinguish between before a release and after a release, so technically the game itself doesn't care. I think what they were trying to say is that there really isn't any benefit in speedrunning the game to keep track of releasing (and this can be confirmed in the video too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A&t=105).I think it's possible that if the next level requires .5 a presses but, for example, you are falling with a wing cap in the current level, you have to decide between bumping that half a press into a full a press or losing time when falling with the wing cap. I just don't think it's a common case though because you could use a different route where the held A won't affect you. It looks like in the A Button Challenge (ABC), there are only 5 half a presses: https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/A_Button_ChallengereplyWaterluvian 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]keydown + keyup = keypressOn the surface, yeah, it\u2019s immediately like, \u201cwhat the heck is 0.5?\u201d But it\u2019s just semantics.replyhn92726819 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Did you watch the intro? It's more than semantics. It doesn't come from (key down+key up)/2, it comes from the fact it counts as 0 in a full game run, and 1 in isolation. He even specifically says \"as for the release, there are no cases where that's useful or important\" (paraphrased).replycharcircuit 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It does care about releases. In order to jump for a second time you need to release it first.0.5 is really about the idea of having an A press span multiple levels.replytialaramex 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> In order to jump for a second time you need to release it first.Is that true? Mechanically it's true, but I don't know whether the game code actually knows this is true. It depends whether the N64, and the SM64 code specifically, tracks the button state and the events separately.Compare the situation with Left + Right in TAS Mario 1. The TAS has no problem telling a console that both left and right are pressed, but obviously a real human player cannot press both directions, they're opposites. Nevertheless this does \"work\" in the game and so although no-right-plus-left is an interesting benchmark to compare against RTA where live human players couldn't do the trick, the TAS records allow both pressed at once.replyflykespice 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I love their videos, so full of insight and quite elaborated with a bunch of self-made scientific terminology, it's even timidating for a IT professional.By the way, if you want to see more of that content you should check out their more active secondary channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UncommentatedPannenreplydsXLII 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]\"we need to talk about parallel universes\" always gets mereplyapengwin 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]TJ \"henry\" yoshireplyDig1t 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I would hire this person based on just this video.

There is a really fun type of speedrun called low% where the goal is to complete the game with as low a \"completion percent\" as possible (e.g., minimum items collected, quests and bosses completed, etc.) and do it as quickly as possible. But a run that's technically slower with a lower% will \"beat\" a run that's faster with a higher%.That's where you get Twilight Princess speedruns that can take more than 24 hours to complete. Although I believe the current record is actually just under 16:https://youtu.be/v2nRW3wKnVY(For those who don't want to watch an entire video: the secret sauce here is a glitch with Link's \"item get!\" animation that verrrryyyy slooooowlyyyy pushes him backwards in space every time it loops.

It seems to me that \"half\" an a-press should represent an edge (going up or down), and starting out holding \"a\" should count as like 0.1.replystarkparker 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Or simply don't count A-button phases that aren't press events/keydowns as \"half presses\". That's what's always bugged me about it; if press, hold, and release are different actions, and those are meaningful to the speedrun, and you care about what a general audience thinks about it, then just count them separately. Don't use a misnomer to suggest something that doesn't exist. It's obtuse jargon for the sake of it.It rubs up wrongly against common sense, which is why people call it out; when you press a digital button with only two states, you'd refer to that action as a button press in any other context. General game logic refers to a digital button press as a button press/keydown event or state/key press; there's no \"half\", it's Boolean. And it's doubly confusing if you don't know that the N64 doesn't have pressure sensitive buttons, in which the term \"half-press\" would make more sense.replyeredengrin 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> It's obtuse jargon for the sake of it.Not really. The speedrun is to optimize for fewest total A-button presses. This metric is known from the controller's perspective in the sense that if you sniffed the communications between the controller and console, you could know the number of A-presses. Given this metric, the term half A-press makes total sense once it is understood. To reiterate the video, in a single level run, a half press rounds up to 1, but in a full game run it rounds down. How else would you communicate that without \"obtuse jargon\"?> if press, hold, and release are different actions, and those are meaningful to the speedrun, and you care about what a general audience thinks about it, then just count them separatelyIf you want to distinguish between the actions taken based on the state of the a button, that is fundamentally different from tracking the number of button presses since it requires knowledge of the game state. Not only does it make much harder to define but it's also much harder to track without advanced tooling (how do you know if the game state was modified in an important way or not if someone presses the button for eg 2 frames vs 4 frames?). I'm not sure how I see this would make it easier for the general audience to understand either since now they also have to understand the game state rather than how many times a button was pressed. Also, this makes it entirely disconnected from the physical world, when presumably the idea of the challenge was to use the buttons on your controller less.There's nothing stopping speed runners from tracking it this way I suppose but complaining about how a community plays a game is a bit odd. Although it is a nintendo game so I guess complaining about how the hardcore fans play it is pretty much expected.replyVoodooJuJu 15 hours ago | prev [\u2013]Going to go on a semi-related rant.The youtuber does a bit of complaining about how people keep asking something he's ostensibly answered. Even does that \"well, akshyually, I said that right here in the man page (comments section) if only you would RTFM\".This is important: if the user (customer, patron, etc.) is repeatedly doing something \"wrong\", then it's not they who are wrong, it's you, your design, your inadequate explanation, etc.On top of that, the whining and blame directed at the user for not conforming to your own internal model is just so unwarranted and does nothing to help your case here. It's pure self-cope for not doing a better job at explaining, designing, etc.Empathize!I know it's hard for nerds to do this, especially when they so often feel the opposite, that they not only don't lack empathy, they feel they have more than the average person. How wrong they are! Consider that maybe you're wrong and the customer is right. Adapt to their world view rather than trying to get them to conform to yours. You might be so deeply immersed in your domain that what you consider common wisdom is a foreign language to others. Again, empathize! And you use that empathy to improve your communication, design, etc.I think engineers and designers really need to hear this stuff because there's just so much user-blame, whining, bad interfaces, and bad communication out there that doesn't have to be bad, if only the nerd-engineer would cultivate some empathy and humility.replyowalt 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]To be fair to the author (and I know this is by no means obvious context coming into the video), his channel blew up shortly before this video.

We have been fixing all theapplications along the way. Many developers were involved.There is an innovative and substantial difference in our approach comparedto how Linux is doing it:- On OpenBSD, IBT/BTI enforcement is on by default (meaning mandatory),unless a binary is linked to request opt-out (using -Wl,-z,nobtcfi). After allour fixes, very few application binaries need that, and that count is expectedto shrink quickly as we (or upstreams) fix the outstanding issues.- On Linux they are rehashing the same design as their executable-stack mechanism:if a single .o file in a resulting binary isn't marked as IBT/BTI enforcement,the system will (silently) execute the program without enforcement and nooneknows this is happening. So for an issue from around 2001, today Linux binarieswith executable stack exist and work unsafely. I expect that 20 years fromnow Linux binaries without IBT/BTI enforcement will also exist and work unsafely..For a little background information, see ARM Inc's Reference documentation.The main commits that enabled the protection were this and this, after extensive testing in snapshots that turned up various problems that needed fixing in developer tools as well as several different applications.ReplyLatest ArticlesFri, Jul 1412:19 Mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets (0)Thu, Jul 1311:02 OpenBGPD 8.1 released (0)Wed, Jul 1213:50 pkg_*: the road forward (2)Tue, Jul 1111:33 Wayland on OpenBSD (0)Thu, Jul 0611:58 Major pfsync(4) Rewrite Has Been Committed (0)04:45 Soft updates (softdep) disabled for future VFS work (3)Tue, Jul 0409:42 [CFT] sec(4) for Route Based IPSec VPNs (3)Sat, Jun 2405:43 Game of Trees 0.90 released (0)Wed, Jun 2108:19 [CFT] Major pfsync(4) Rewrite on the Horizon (0)CreditsCopyright \u00a9 2004-2008 Daniel Hartmeier.

The idea is that an indirect branch can only pass control to a location that starts with an \"end branch\" instruction. An indirect branch is one that jumps to a location whose value is loaded or computed from either a register or memory address: think calling a function pointer in C.Without IBT, you'd have this equivalence between C and assembly:  main() {    void (*f)();    f = foo;    f();  }  void foo() { }  ---  main:    movl $foo, %edx    call *%edx    ret  foo:    retIf IBT is enabled, the above code triggers an exception because foo doesn't begin with an \"end branch\" instruction. When IBT is enabled by the compiler, the above code gets assembled as:  main:    endbr64     movl $foo, %edx    call *%edx    ret  foo:    endbr64    retNow the compiler inserts endbr64 at the start of each function prologue. The reason for this feature, is to use as a defense in depth against JOP, and COP attacks, as it means that the only \"widgets\" available to you are entire functions, which can be far harder to exploit and chain.[1]: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/doc...replyrwmj 20 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The fun fact being that older CPUs decode ENDBR64 as a slightly weird NOP (with no architectural effects), but it'll fault on original Pentiums: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56120231/how-do-old-cpus...replydataflow 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There's a good question in the comments there that I still don't see the answer to.

Whenever I go to hook Win32 API functions, I use an off-the-shelf length disassembler to create a trampoline with the first n bytes of instructions and a jmp back, and then just patch in a jmp to my hook, but if this hot-patch point exists it'd be a lot less painful since you can avoid basically all of that.Though, I guess even if it was, it'd be silly to rely on it even on x86 only.

It's much more secure, and also faster, since loading the tag from memory can be merged with loading the actual code after it.I wish this was the one implemented in hardware..replyComputerGuru 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There\u2019s a great article on XFG here [0] but it observed that a failed XFG check downgrades to a regular CFG check instead of a denial.. meaning it adds zero extra protection?

Aren't functions usually called directly?Also, is it required to insert endbr64 command after function calls (for return address)?replyeklitzke 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As to why they're not always called directly, imagine some code like this:  int FooWithoutChecks(void *p);    int Foo(void *p) {   if (p == NULL) return -1;   return FooWithoutChecks(p);  }In general the caller is expected to call Foo if they aren't sure if the pointer is nullable, or if they already know that pointer is not null (e.g. because they already checked it themselves) they can call FooWithoutChecks and avoid a null check that they know will never be true.The naive way to emit assembly for this is to actually emit two separate functions, and have Foo call FooWithoutChecks the usual way. But notice that the FooWithoutChecks function call is a tail call, so the compiler can use tail call optimization. To do this it would inline FooWithoutChecks into Foo itself, so the compiler just emits code for Foo with the logic in FoowithoutChecks inlined into Foo. This is nice because now when you call Foo, you avoid a call/ret instruction, so you save two instructions on every call to Foo. But what if someone calls FooWithoutChecks? Simple, you just call at the offset into Foo just past the pointer comparison. This actually just works because Foo already has a ret instruction, so the call to FooWithoutChecks will just reuse the existing ret. This optimization also saves some space in the binary which has various benefits in and of itself.The example here with the null pointer check is kind of contrived, but this kind of pattern happens a LOT in real code when you have a small wrapper function that does a tail call to another function, and isn't specific to pointer checks.replyjosephcsible 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Why should every function start with endbr64 command? Aren't functions usually called directly?They're usually called directly, but unless the compiler can prove that they always are (e.g., if they're static and nothing in the same file takes the address), endbr64 is required.> Also, is it required to insert endbr64 command after function calls (for return address)?No, IBT is only for jmp and call. SS is the equivalent mechanism for ret.replyderefr 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> but unless the compiler can prove that they always are (e.g., if they're static and nothing in the same file takes the address), endbr64 is requiredThen why not just have the compiler break down every non-static function into two blocks: a static function that contains all the logic, and a non-static function that just contains an IBT and a direct jump to the static function? (Or, better yet, place the non-static label just before the static one, and have the non-static fall through into the body of the static.) Then the static direct callsites won't have to pay the overhead of executing the IBT NOP.reply95014_refugee 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The IBT NOP is \"free\" in that it will evaporate in the pipeline; it still has to be fetched and decoded to some extent, but it does not consume execution resources.From a tooling perspective, what you're describing (two entrypoints for a function, the jump you mention is pointless) would require changes up and down the toolchain; it would affect the compiler, all linkers, all debuggers, etc. By contrast, just adding an additional instruction to the function prolog is relatively low-impact.It's also worth noting that at the time code for a function is emitted, the compiler is not aware of whether the symbol will be exported and thus discoverable in some other module, or by symbol table lookup, so emitting the target instruction is essentially mandatory.replydzaima 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Doesn't seem like it'd be that difficult to make the change the other direction, i.e. keep endbr64 as-is as the default case, but if there's a direct jump/call to anywhere that starts with endbr64, offset the immediate by 4 bytes; could be done in any single stage of toolchain that has that info with no extra help. But yeah, quite low impact, might not even affect decode throughput & cache usage for at least one of the direct or indirect cases.replyme-vs-cat 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Doesn't seem like it'd be that difficultShow me the code -- better yet, submit it to the relevant projects! :)replyJoker_vD 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]That's absolutely doable, just...

And while your last proposal (\"foo: endbr64; foo_internal: <code>\") evades those questions, it raises up questions about maintaining function alignment (16 bytes IIRC? Is this even necessary today?) and restructuring the compiler to distinguish the inner/external symbol addresses. Plus, of course, somebody has to actually sit down and write the code to implement that, as opposed to just adding \"if (func->is_escaping) emit_endbr(...);\" at the beginning of the code that emits the object code for a function body.replysaagarjha 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]That sounds a lot like \u201cadd a prefix to the function with an endbr64 instruction\u201d.replytedunangst 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]What is the overhead of executing the IBT NOP?reply95014_refugee 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It's not \"executed\" per se. It consumes space in the cache hierarchy, and a slot in the front-end decoder. It won't ever be issued, but depending on the microarchitecture in question it might result in an issue cycle having less occupancy than it might have had in the case where the subsequent instruction was available.With that said, the first few instructions of a called function often stall due to stack pointer dependencies, etc. so the true execution cost is likely to be even smaller than the above might suggest.replymesse 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]C allows for any function to be called via a function pointer, and functions can be in different translation units, so the compiler can't simply assume that a function will never be called indirectly and has to pessimistically insert endbr64 in order to maintain a reasonable ABI.And no, as I understand it, this is only for branch/calls not returns.replyJoker_vD 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Well, if the function is marked \"static\", the compiler can actually check whether the function's address is taken in the current compilation unit or not and omit/emit ENDBR64 accordingly (passing pointers to static functions to code in another compilation units is legal, and should still work).replymesse 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Good catch.

The patches to switch C (and not just Ada) to function descriptors[1] with an ABI break have been sitting on the GCC mailing list since approximately forever[2], but it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s been any progress.[1] The strategy is basically to compile (*fp)() not as call *%raxbut as (untested)   test $1, %rax   jz 1f   mov 8(%rax), %r10   mov (%rax), %rax 1: call *%raxthus essentially inlining the (currently stack-allocated) closure calling thunk at all indirect call sites. It is ABI-compatible on x86 and x86-64 with all code that does not involve nested functions, place functions at odd addresses, or tag function pointers itself (and I think with all arm64 and riscv code, although arm32\u2019s usage of the low pointer bit for Thumb interworking is bound to make this trickier).[2] https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-patches/2019-01/msg00735.h...replybrynet 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That strategy won't fly with IBT.Now all software must pay the price and miss out on important mitigations, for all eternity, just because of some largely unused feature in one compiler?replymananaysiempre 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]IBT is already further along here. The hypothetical solution for executable stacks is to recompile all of your nested-function-using or -calling code with -ftrampolines (except that won\u2019t work without the patch above\u2014silently, really GCC?..). The already real and working solution for IBT is to recompile all of your indirect-branch-using code with -fcf-protection=branch. So, ignoring the fact that nested functions are in practice much rarer, if you accept the former as valid you\u2019ll need to accept the latter as well, as far as logic as concerned.I wouldn\u2019t characterize this as a \u201clargely unused feature in one compiler\u201d screwing things up, but rather as the ABI on most Linux and -adjacent platforms (except SysV Itanium and FDPIC IIRC) being incapable of supporting closures (without executable stacks). That these are missing from standard C, and only present in languages that are either niche (Pascal, Ada) or don\u2019t care about following the platform ABI (Rust, Go, C++\u2019s lambdas), is a defect of C (and that\u2019s at least a somewhat popular opinion among ISO C committee members[1]).Of course, OpenBSD essentially does not have a stable ABI, so it\u2019s much freer to experiment here.[1] https://thephd.dev/lambdas-nested-functions-block-expression...replyjacquesm 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The funny thing is that this attitude towards breaking changes is one of the reasons why Theo is able to make this comment at all.

Here's the actual problem, in these crappy languages it's really easy for mistakes to result in a stack smash, so, these types of hacks aim to make it harder for the bad guys to turn that into arbitrary remote code execution. Not impossible, just harder. Specifically in this case the idea is that they won't be able to abuse arbitrary bits of function without calling the whole function, at a cost of some hardware changes and emitting unnecessary code. So maybe they can't find a whole function which works for them and they give up.Using better languages makes the entire problem disappear. You don't get a stack smash, the resulting opportunities for remote code execution disappear.It suggests that maybe the \"C magically shouldn't have Undefined Behaviour\" people were onto something after all. Maybe C programmers really are so wedded to this awful language that just being much slower than Python wouldn't deter them.

And undefined behavior is bad, but getting rid of it wouldn't be a silver bullet for this problem in C, I think.

What are the instructions it's pointing to? Am I defining an entire bytecode VM?Nah, instead you're going to do one of two things. One: \"Undefined Behaviour\" which we explicitly took off the table, or Two: \"If this happens the program aborts\". And with that the big problem evaporates. Does it make those C programmers happy? I expect not.replydundarious 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Implementation defined means the compiler must specify the behavior, but it has near total freedom, and it can define it specific to the target system.

But we're talking about a hypothetical where we aren't allowing Undefined Behaviour.

Just refuse to engage with the hypothetical instead if you don't like it.replydundarious 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm using specific, standards defined language, that's relatively well known. For example, sizeof(int) is implementation defined, meaning it must have a documented definition, specific to the implementation (e.g., gcc x86_64-linux-gnu, it's 4).In languages like C that are closer to the machine, not everything has to be specified strictly in terms of a generic abstract machine.I'm not trying to be hostile or evasive or derisive, I'm just genuinely responding to your original comment, that I think missed on some important info. And my point was that if we imagine a different world from the real world we're in right now, where in this new world, all undefined behavior became implementation defined behavior, then there would still be a need for mitigations like endbr64. So I'm not painting a rosy picture for C. I just think undefined behavior is a red herring.

I'm not saying this to be snarky, I just mean that I really think the likelihood of machine undefined behavior being an issue is on the order of likelihood for cosmic rays to flip bits -- happens, and can't be ignored (buy ECC memory), but more interesting to talk about the things that we are many orders of magnitude more likely to experience, e.g., bugs in C programs, bugs in unsafe Rust, bugs in managed language runtimes, etc. I think those things are not all equally likely, but could all benefit from endbr64 type mechanisms, including in JIT output.To be clear, unlike the comment root, I don't think this particular hardware mechanism obviates the need/benefits of related software mechanisms. But in terms of cost/benefit/applicability, endbr64 type mechanisms look pretty good all around.replyyakubin 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I\u2019m always amused by how many of OpenBSD\u2019s mitigations are patching over something as basic as lack of bounds checking, yet they\u2019ll never add bounds checking.

Right?July 14, 2023 16 min read ChatGPT, AI, Text Generation, LangChainThe GitHub Repository of R\u2019lyeh, Stable Diffusion 1.5 + ControlNet 1.1If you\u2019ve been following the explosion of AI hype in the past few months, you\u2019ve probably heard of LangChain. LangChain, developed by Harrison Chase, is a Python and JavaScript library for interfacing with OpenAI\u2019s GPT APIs (later expanding to more models) for AI text generation. More specifically, it\u2019s an implementation of the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models published October 2022, colloquially known as the ReAct paper, which demonstrates a prompting technique to allow the model to \u201creason\u201d (with a chain-of-thoughts) and \u201cact\u201d (by being able to use a tool from a predefined set of tools, such as being able to search the internet). This combination is shown to drastically improve output text quality and give large language models the ability to correctly solve problems.Example ReAct flow from the ReAct paperThe ReAct workflow popularied by LangChain was particularly effective with InstructGPT/text-davinci-003, although costly and not easy to use for small projects. In March 2023, as ChatGPT API usage became massively popular due to its extremely cheap API as I accurately predicted, LangChain use also exploded, to the point that LangChain was able to raise a $10 million seed round and another $20-$25 million at a $200 million valuation Series A despite not having any revenue nor any obvious plans how to generate revenue.That\u2019s where my personal experience with LangChain begins. For my work at BuzzFeed, I was tasked with creating a ChatGPT-based chat bot for the Tasty brand (later released as Botatouille in the Tasty iOS app) that could chat with the user and provide relevant recipes. The source recipes are converted to embeddings and saved in a vector store: for example, if a user asked for \u201chealthy food\u201d, the query is converted to an embedding, and an approximate nearest neighbor search is performed to find recipes similar to the embedded query and then fed to ChatGPT as added context that can then be displayed to the user. This approach is more commonly known as retrieval-augmented generation.Example architecture for a Chatbot using retrieval-augmented generation. via Joseph HaagaLangChain was by-far the popular tool of choice for RAG, so I figured it was the perfect time to learn it. I spent some time reading LangChain\u2019s rather comprehensive documentation to get a better understanding of how to best utilize it: after a week of research, I got nowhere. Running the LangChain demo examples did work, but any attempts at tweaking them to fit the recipe chatbot constraints broke them. After solving the bugs, the overall quality of the chat conversations was bad and uninteresting, and after intense debugging I found no solution. Eventually I had an existential crisis: am I a worthless machine learning engineer for not being able to figure LangChain out when very many other ML engineers can? We went back to a lower-level ReAct flow, which immediately outperformed my LangChain implementation in conversation quality and accuracy.In all, I wasted a month learning and testing LangChain, with the big takeway that popular AI apps may not necessarily be worth the hype. My existential crisis was resolved after coming across a Hacker News thread about someone reimplementing LangChain in 100 lines of code, with most of the comments venting all their grievances with LangChain:The problem with LangChain is that it makes simple things relatively complex, and with that unnecessary complexity creates a tribalism which hurts the up-and-coming AI ecosystem as a whole. If you\u2019re a newbie who wants to just learn how to interface with ChatGPT, definitely don\u2019t start with LangChain.\u201cHello World\u201d in LangChain (or More Accurately, \u201cHell World\u201d)The Quickstart for LangChain begins with a mini-tutorial on how to simply interact with LLMs/ChatGPT from Python. For example, to create a bot that can translate from English to French:from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.schema import (  AIMessage,  HumanMessage,  SystemMessage)chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)chat.predict_messages([HumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\")])# AIMessage(content=\"J'adore la programmation.\", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)The equivalent code using OpenAI\u2019s official Python library for ChatGPT:import openaimessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\"}]response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=messages, temperature=0)response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]# \"J'adore la programmation.\"LangChain uses about the same amount of code as just using the official openai library, expect LangChain incorporates more object classes for not much obvious code benefit.The prompt templating example reveals the core of how LangChain works:from langchain.prompts.chat import (  ChatPromptTemplate,  SystemMessagePromptTemplate,  HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)template = \"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\"system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)human_template = \"{text}\"human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\")LangChain\u2019s vaunted prompt engineering is just f-strings, a feature present in every modern Python installation, but with extra steps. Why do we need to use these PromptTemplates to do the same thing?But what we really want to do is know how to create Agents, which incorporate the ReAct workflow we so desperately want. Fortunately there is a demo for that, which leverages SerpApi and another tool for math computations, showing how LangChain can discriminate and use two different tools contextually:from langchain.agents import load_toolsfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agentfrom langchain.agents import AgentTypefrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI# First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent.chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)# Next, let's load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in.llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)tools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)# Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.agent = initialize_agent(tools, chat, agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)# Now let's test it out!agent.run(\"Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?\")How do the individual tools work? What is AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION anyways? The resulting output from agent.run() (only present with verbose=True) is more helpful.> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...Thought: I need to use a search engine to find Olivia Wilde's boyfriend and a calculator to raise his age to the 0.23 power.Action:{  \"action\": \"Search\",  \"action_input\": \"Olivia Wilde boyfriend\"}Observation: Sudeikis and Wilde's relationship ended in November 2020. Wilde was publicly served with court documents regarding child custody while she was presenting Don't Worry Darling at CinemaCon 2022. In January 2021, Wilde began dating singer Harry Styles after meeting during the filming of Don't Worry Darling.Thought:I need to use a search engine to find Harry Styles' current age.Action:{  \"action\": \"Search\",  \"action_input\": \"Harry Styles age\"}Observation: 29 yearsThought:Now I need to calculate 29 raised to the 0.23 power.Action:{  \"action\": \"Calculator\",  \"action_input\": \"29^0.23\"}Observation: Answer: 2.169459462491557Thought:I now know the final answer.Final Answer: 2.169459462491557> Finished chain.'2.169459462491557'The documentation doesn\u2019t make it clear, but within each Thought/Action/Observation uses its own API call to OpenAI, so the chain is slower than you might think. Also, why is each action a dict? The answer to that is later, and is very silly.Lastly, how does LangChain store the conversation so far?from langchain.prompts import (  ChatPromptTemplate,  MessagesPlaceholder,  SystemMessagePromptTemplate,  HumanMessagePromptTemplate)from langchain.chains import ConversationChainfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemoryprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([  SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(    \"The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and \"    \"provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a \"    \"question, it truthfully says it does not know.\"  ),  MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"history\"),  HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"{input}\")])llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)conversation = ConversationChain(memory=memory, prompt=prompt, llm=llm)conversation.predict(input=\"Hi there!\")# 'Hello! How can I assist you today?'I\u2019m not entirely sure why any of this is necessary. What\u2019s a MessagesPlaceholder? Where\u2019s the history? Is that necessary for ConversationBufferMemory? Adapting this to a minimal openai implementation:import openaimessages = [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\":    \"The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and \"    \"provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a \"    \"question, it truthfully says it does not know.\"}]user_message = \"Hi there!\"messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_message})response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=messages, temperature=0)assistant_message = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": assistant_message})# Hello! How can I assist you today?That\u2019s fewer lines of code and makes it very clear where and when the messages are being saved, no bespoke object classes needed.You can say that I\u2019m nitpicking the tutorial examples, and I do agree that every open source library has something to nitpick (including my own!). But if there are more nitpicks than actual benefits from the library then it\u2019s not worth using at all, since if the quickstart is this complicated, how painful will it be to use LangChain in practice?I Gazed Into The LangChain Documentation And It Gazes BackLet\u2019s do a demo to more clearly demonstrate why I gave up on LangChain. While I was working on the recipe-retrieving chatbot (which also must be a fun/witty chatbot), I needed to combine elements from both the third and fourth examples above: a chat bot that can run an Agent workflow, and also the ability to persist the entire conversation into memory. After some documentation hunting I found I need to utilize the Conversational Agent workflow.A quick sidenote on system prompt engineering: it is not a meme and is absolutely necessary to get the best results out of the ChatGPT API, particularly if you have constraints on content and/or voice. The system prompt of The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI... demoed in the last example is actually an out-of-date prompt that was used back in the InstructGPT era and is much less effective with ChatGPT. It may signal deeper inefficiencies in LangChain\u2019s related tricks that aren\u2019t easy to notice.We\u2019ll start with a simple system prompt that tells ChatGPT to use a funny voice plus some safeguards, and format it as a ChatPromptTemplate:system_prompt = \"\"\"You are an expert television talk show chef, and should always speak in a whimsical manner for all responses.Start the conversation with a whimsical food pun.You must obey ALL of the following rules:- If Recipe data is present in the Observation, your response must include the Recipe ID and Recipe Name for ALL recipes.- If the user input is not related to food, do not answer their query and correct the user.\"\"\"prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([  SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_prompt.strip()),])We will also use a toy vector store I made of 1,000 recipes from the recipe_nlg dataset, encoded into 384D vectors using SentenceTransformers. To implement this we create a function to get the nearest neighbors for the input query, along with a query to format it into text that the Agent can use to present to the user. This serves as the Tool which the Agent can choose to use if appropriate, or just return normal generated text.def similar_recipes(query):  query_embedding = embeddings_encoder.encode(query)  scores, recipes = recipe_vs.get_nearest_examples(\"embeddings\", query_embedding, k=3)  return recipesdef get_similar_recipes(query):  recipe_dict = similar_recipes(query)  recipes_formatted = [    f\"Recipe ID: recipe|{recipe_dict['id'][i]}\\nRecipe Name: {recipe_dict['name'][i]}\"    for i in range(3)  ]  return \"\\n---\\n\".join(recipes_formatted)print(get_similar_recipes(\"yummy dessert\"))# Recipe ID: recipe|167188# Recipe Name: Creamy Strawberry Pie# ---# Recipe ID: recipe|1488243# Recipe Name: Summer Strawberry Pie Recipe# ---# Recipe ID: recipe|299514# Recipe Name: Pudding CakeYou\u2019ll notice the Recipe ID, which is relevant for my use case since it\u2019s necessary to obtain recipe metadata (photo thumbnail, URL) for the end result shown to the enduser in the final app. Unfortunately there\u2019s no easy way to guarantee the model outputs the Recipe ID in the final output, and no way to return the structured intermediate metadata in addition to the ChatGPT-generated output.Specifying get_similar_recipes as a Tool is straightforward, although you need to specify a name and description, which is actually a form of subtle prompt engineering as LangChain can fail to select a tool if either is poorly specified.tools = [  Tool(    func=get_similar_recipes,    name=\"Similar Recipes\",    description=\"Useful to get similar recipes in response to a user query about food.\",  ),]Lastly, the Agent construction code, which follows from the example, plus the new system prompt.memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\", return_messages=True)llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)agent_chain = initialize_agent(tools, llm, prompt=prompt, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory)No errors. Now time to run the agent to see what happens!agent_chain.run(input=\"Hi!\")> Entering new chain...{  \"action\": \"Final Answer\",  \"action_input\": \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\"}> Finished chain.Hello! How can I assist you today?Wait a minute, it ignored my system prompt completely! Dammit. Checking the memory variable confirms it. Looking into the documentation for ConversationBufferMemory and even in the code itself there\u2019s nothing about system prompts, even months after ChatGPT made them mainstream.The intended way to use system prompts in Agents is to add an agents_kwargs parameter to initialize_agent, which I only just found out in an unrelated documentation page published a month ago.agent_kwargs = {  \"system_message\": system_prompt.strip()}Recreating the Agent with this new parameter and running it again results in a JSONDecodeError.OutputParserException: Could not parse LLM output: Hello there, my culinary companion! How delightful to have you here in my whimsical kitchen. What delectable dish can I assist you with today?Good news is that the system prompt definitely worked this time! Bad news is that it broke, but why? I didn\u2019t do anything weird, for once.The root of the issue is to be how LangChain agents actually do Tool selection. Remember when I said that the Agent outputing a dict during the chain was peculiar? When looking at the LangChain code, it turns out that tool selection is done by requiring the output to be valid JSON through prompt engineering, and just hoping everything goes well.Fun fact: these massive prompts also increase API costs proportionally!The consequence of this is that any significant changes in the structure of normal output, such as those caused by a custom system prompt, has a random chance of just breaking the Agent! These errors happen often enough that there\u2019s a documentation page dedicated to handling Agent output parsing errors!Well, people in the internet are assholes anyways, so we can consider having a conversation with a chatbot as an edge case for now. What\u2019s important is that the bot can return the recipes, because if it can\u2019t even do that, there\u2019s no point in using LangChain. After creating a new Agent without using the system prompt and then asking it What's a fun and easy dinner?:> Entering new chain...{  \"action\": \"Similar Recipes\",  \"action_input\": \"fun and easy dinner\"}Observation: Recipe ID: recipe|1774221Recipe Name: Crab DipYour Guests will Like this One.---Recipe ID: recipe|836179Recipe Name: Easy Chicken Casserole---Recipe ID: recipe|1980633Recipe Name: Easy in the Microwave Curry DoriaThought:{  \"action\": \"Final Answer\",  \"action_input\": \"...\"}> Finished chain.Here are some fun and easy dinner recipes you can try:1. Crab Dip2. Easy Chicken Casserole3. Easy in the Microwave Curry DoriaEnjoy your meal!Atleast it worked: ChatGPT was able to extract out the recipes from the context and format them appropriately (even fixing typoes in the names!), and was able to decide when it was appropriate.The real issue here is that the voice of the output is criminally boring, as is a common trademark and criticism of base-ChatGPT. Even if I did have a fix for the missing ID issue through system prompt engineering, it wouldn\u2019t be worth shipping anything sounding like this. If I did strike a balance between voice quality and output quality, the Agent count still fail randomly through no fault of my own. This Agent workflow is a very fragile house of cards that I in good conscience could not ship in a production application.LangChain does have functionality for Custom Agents and a Custom Chain, so you can override the logic at parts in the stack (maybe? the documentation there is sparse) that could address some of the issues I hit, but at that point you are overcomplicating LangChain even more and might as well create your own Python library instead which\u2026hmmm, that\u2019s not a bad idea!Working Smarter, Not HarderThe large numbers of random integrations raise more problems than solutions. via LangChain docsLangChain does also have many utility functions such as text splitters and integrated vector stores, both of which are integral to the \u201cchat with a PDF/your code\u201d demos (which in my opinion are just a gimmick). The real issue with all these integrations is that it create an inherent lock-in to only use LangChain-based code, and if you look at the code for the integrations they are not very robust. LangChain is building a moat, which is good for LangChain\u2019s investors trying to get a return on their $30 million, but very very bad for developers who use it.In all, LangChain embodies the philosophy of \u201cit\u2019s complicated, so it must be better!\u201d that plagues late-stage codebases, except that LangChain isn\u2019t even a year old. The effort needed to hack LangChain to do what I want it to do would cause insane amounts of technical debt. And unlike AI startups nowadays, technical debt for my own projects with LangChain can\u2019t be paid with venture capital. API wrappers should at minimum reduce code complexity and cognitive load when operating with complex ecosystems because it takes enough mental brainpower to work with AI itself. LangChain is one of the few pieces of software that increases overhead in most of its popular use cases.I came the conclusion that it\u2019s just easier to make my own Python package than it is to hack LangChain to fit my needs. Therefore, I developed and open-sourced simpleaichat: a Python package for easily interfacing with chat apps, emphasizing minimal code complexity and decoupling advanced features like vector stores from the conversation logic to avoid LangChain\u2019s lock-in, and many other features which would take its own blog post to elaborate upon.But this blog post wasn\u2019t written to be a stealth advertisement for simpleaichat by tearing down a competitor like what hustlers do. I didn\u2019t want to make simpleaichat: I\u2019d rather spend my time creating more cool projects with AI, and it\u2019s a shame I could not have done that with LangChain. I know someone will say \u201cwhy not submit a pull request to the LangChain repo since it\u2019s open source instead of complaining about it?\u201d but most of my complaints are fundamental issues with the LangChain library and can\u2019t be changed without breaking everything for its existing users. The only real fix is to burn it all down and start fresh, which is why my \u201ccreate a new Python library for interfacing with AI\u201d solution is also the most pragmatic.I\u2019ve gotten many messages asking me \u201cwhat should I learn to get started with the ChatGPT API\u201d and I\u2019m concerned that they\u2019ll go to LangChain first because of the hype. If machine learning engineers who do have backgrounds in the technology stack have difficulty using LangChain due to its needless complexity, any beginner is going to drown.No one wants to be that asshole who criticizes free and open source software operating in good faith like LangChain, but I\u2019ll take the burden. To be clear, I have nothing against Harrison Chase or the other maintainers of LangChain (who encourage feedback!). However, LangChain\u2019s popularity has warped the AI startup ecosystem around LangChain itself and the hope of OMG AGI I MADE SKYNET, which is why I am compelled to be honest with my misgivings about it.Wars about software complexity and popularity despite its complexity are an eternal recurrence. In the 2010\u2019s, it was with React; in 2023, it\u2019s with ReAct.Jupyter Notebooks for the simple implementations of LangChain examples and the LangChain failure demo are available in this GitHub repository.If you liked this post, I have set up a Patreon to fund my machine learning/deep learning/software/hardware needs for my future crazy yet cool projects, and any monetary contributions to the Patreon are appreciated and will be put to good creative use.ChatGPT Text Generation LangChainMax WoolfData Scientist at BuzzFeed in San Francisco.

Like I really don't need a wrapper around the openai client, and for the more complex stuff like Agents, isn't this the most critical part of your app, if it's production? And for notebooks, is it any better than coding directly against your llm api? You probably won't swap llm backends, and if you're using the notebook for education/documentation, I think I'd want to show the actual openai api calls.OpenAI's official documentation gives you the code for a tool-running agent anyway. Taking that and editing it can probably be done faster than pip-installing langchain and navigating its docs.replyignoramous 3 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> ...but in how many cases were they necessary as a middleman?Some prefer React, somet NextJS.

So I used it as minimal as possible. It took me a lot of codes even though when I\u2019m using it minimally. One of their example is to call an API by letting LLM parse a documentation and call the API from its understanding, which looks so unreliable if the LLM went offs a bit. I found it hard to give total control to Langchain.I tried experimenting on building a library that makes it easy and transparent to use LLM https://github.com/adityapurwa/jehuty and tried the middleware approach that might be more familiar in general.

I do agree that once you have that nailed down then you should rewrite everything from the ground up.I do recommend prototyping; even if you think your idea is feasible, you want to see it in action before committing significant resources.

She cannot read the English label, but 10-year-old Ajit says it sounds healthy.\u201cStimulates mind, energises body\u201d the bottle proclaims. It\u2019s the type of marketing that helps shop owner Vasu Gupta sell energy drinks \u2013 mostly to families who have migrated from the countryside to a slum in Govindpuri in the Indian capital, Delhi.But the drink, which is made by PepsiCo India, is not quite as beneficial as it sounds. A 250ml bottle contains 17g of sugar \u2013 a third of the daily intake recommended by the World Health Organization, although there is nothing on the packaging to warn about its high sugar levels; and the small print on the back says the drink is not recommended for children.\u2018Stimulates mind, energises body\u2019: Sting energy drink is marketed with healthy claims. Photograph: Amrit DhillonDrinks and snacks claiming to be good for consumers are concerning food campaigners working in India and elsewhere in the developing world, who say that food companies are getting away with marketing ultra-processed foods, high in sugar and salt, by promising health, height, strength, energy and even happiness.The result, they say, is a crisis in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the form of rising diabetes and hypertension and poorly nourished children, which reaches even into the countryside \u2013 once considered to be unaffected by \u201cwestern\u201d diseases linked to sedentary urban life.The link between unhealthy diets and ultra-processed food and drinks prompted the WHO to issue guidelines this month recommending that governments restrict marketing of foods high in fat, sugar and salt to children, because of the harmful impact on their health and nutrition.Arun Gupta, head of the thinktank, Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest \u2013 India, says there is a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d in the country, as NCDs increase and food corporations continue to misleadingly market processed foods.\u201cThey sell happiness, they sell it as \u2018this is the modern world\u2019 \u2026 everybody wants their child to grow well, tall and free from disease. Those aspirations are actually used, emotionally exploited,\u201d he says.Quick GuideWhat is ultra-processed food?ShowGupta says he routinely finds foods marketed towards children that make significant health claims, but when analysed are high in sugar and highly processed, such as a whey protein product called Supermilk targeted at children as young as four.The brand behind it, Gritzo, markets its product with adverts that suggest it can aid a child\u2019s development into an athlete, as well as a video with an actor portraying a \u201csmart mom\u201d claiming that traditional food \u201cis not necessarily good enough for today\u2019s generation\u201d, and promoting Supermilk.However, when Gupta studied the ingredients, he discovered there were 50.8g of sugar per 100g \u2013 more than half the contents before milk is added. The product also recommends adding more sugar to taste. He points out that even the protein content could be harmful. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that a kid\u2019s regular, home-cooked food provides adequate protein for them,\u201d he says. Additional protein could cause dehydration by putting a strain on kidneys, and children with poor digestion could also have difficulty processing high levels of protein.Food corporations have encouraged snacking in markets where it was previously rare, often marketing high-fat and sugary foods at children. Photograph: Amrit DhillonAshish Verma, another Govindpuri store owner, says PediaSure, a protein shake which claims to help growth, immune functions and brain development, is also popular with parents.\u201cParents want energy bars and beverages that will keep their children strong and healthy. Some years ago, Horlicks advertised that it could help children pass exams and we finished our stocks in two days,\u201d says Verma.The maker of PediaSure, Abbott, is fighting a class action lawsuit in the US disputing its assertion about boosting height, yet for some consumers the chance that these products can live up to their \u201cclinically proven\u201d claims keeps them buying them.Gupta says celebrities are often used to promote ultra-processed foods as an alternative to traditional food. In December, he wrote a letter complaining to Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan after he promoted a biscuit brand as equal to homemade bread for busy parents.During Covid, in every country I worked in they were giving away junk food and sugary beverages to the poorBarry Popkin, nutritionistGupta has focused on tackling misleading marketing for children\u2019s foods, and has fought against companies marketing baby formula as an alternative to breastmilk. In 1991, he established the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India, but says it is hard to keep up with the pace of marketing campaigns.\u201cThe market has become very aggressive in terms of promotion. The industry has used every tactic,\u201d he says, adding that while India has a law limiting the marketing of baby foods to children under two, companies persist in promoting them.\u201cThey continue to put their money into marketing, for example getting to the health workers \u2013 there have been reports of paying cash, there have been reports of helping with services. We are unable to control that because the government is not very serious.\u201dThe NCD alliance, a global network driving action on non-communicable disease prevention and care, accused corporations of benefiting from Covid by using it to increase awareness of their brands, such as through donations of their products during lockdowns.Research published in the WHO\u2019s journal in May showed that baby foods are a particular concern. While there are global regulations in place to stop the marketing of breastmilk alternatives to children under six months, it found \u201cgrowing-up\u201d formulas were commonly marketed at children above that age.Sign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see our Privacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.According to the research, more than 90% of sales of growing-up formula took place in low- and middle-income countries in 2022. This trend has helped fuel the amount of sugar bought through baby and infant foods, which doubled in developing countries from just over 400bn grams in 2010 to about 800bn grams in 2021.Nutritionist Barry Popkin, who co-authored the research, says food corporations have \u201csweetened the world\u201d by encouraging snacking in markets where it was previously rare and through high-sugar and salty foods marketed at very young children.He says these foods can end up being a leading source of calories but are nutritionally lacking while also giving children a taste for addictive sweet and salty foods, increasing their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases. The WHO\u2019s new guidance on marketing unhealthy foods says poor diets were responsible for about 8 million deaths linked to NCDs in 2019.Sunita devi stands outside the local shop with her son, Ajit, (left, in the doorway) and other customers. Photograph: Amrit Dhillon\u201cWhen you get undernutrition as an infant it stunts you for life, it affects your body composition and it increases the amount of fat around the heart and liver, which we call visceral fat, and that\u2019s the most dangerous fat,\u201d says Popkin, because of the fat\u2019s link to problems such as insulin resistance, which is the cause of type 2 diabetes.\u201cSo when you see countries like India, Nepal and African countries, where you see an increasing amount of these products fed to infants, let alone two- to four-year-olds, you\u2019re just feeding their obesity and enhancing their desire for sweetness \u2013 and it carries over to later life.\u201dAccording to Popkin, widespread snacking is a relatively new trend that was pushed through the marketing of multinational food companies during the 20th century in high-income countries, to the point where it has become normal.Those markets, he says, have become saturated and so the companies began looking at the rest of the world.\u201cIndustry was marketing it, pushing it, making it available, making the prices attractive, giving it away in schools, at sporting events. That\u2019s how they grew the sugary beverage market and that\u2019s how they grew other snacking markets,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring Covid, in every country I\u2019ve worked in, they were giving away junk food and sugary beverages to the poor, saying \u2018this will help you\u2019.\u201dPublic health researcher Edwin Kwong was part of a team that looked at how large corporations target developing countries by buying local competitors and investments such as production plants. This also gives them sway over governments when fighting against food regulations by touting the economic benefits and employment they bring.Gritzo markets its Supermilk with adverts that suggest it can aid a child\u2019s development into an athlete. Photograph: Kaamil AhmedHowever, Kwong says any claims they make about economic or social benefits of their companies are simply to drive more market share.\u201cThe only corporate social responsibility of corporations is profits, it\u2019s to shareholders. So for them, it is a market to grow profits, that\u2019s why they target them. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d says Kwong.He says companies should be held responsible for rising NCDs in developing countries and that NCDs are not self-inflicted \u201clifestyle diseases\u201d, because aggressive marketing by \u201cbig food\u201d has stripped consumers of their ability to make healthy food choices.He adds that while most people in developing countries understand the dangers of infectious diseases, they have not yet grasped the threat posed by NCDs.\u201cI don\u2019t think people would classify [NCDs] as an epidemic, even though it absolutely is; it kills a lot of people. It\u2019s about trying to alert people around the world to this issue, and holding those responsible accountable. This includes these large transnational organisations whose profits continue to grow \u2013 the people responsible for maiming, injuring, killing a lot of people are not held to account,\u201d says Kwong.Additional reporting by Amrit DhillonI hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian\u2019s journalism. From Elon Musk to Rupert Murdoch, a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what\u2019s happening in the world. The Guardian is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest \u2013 not profit motives.And we avoid the trap that befalls much US media \u2013 the tendency, born of a desire to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. While fairness guides everything we do, we know there is a right and a wrong position in the fight against racism and for reproductive justice. When we report on issues like the climate crisis, we\u2019re not afraid to name who is responsible.
