Neglected to include comparisons against GPT-4-Turbo or Claude Opus, so I guess it's far from being a frontier model. We'll see how it fares in the LLM Arena. reply CuriouslyC 17 hours agoparentThey didn't compare against the best models because they were trying to do \"in class\" comparisons, and the 70B model is in the same class as Sonnet (which they do compare against) and GPT3.5 (which is much worse than sonnet). If they're beating sonnet that means they're going to be within stabbing distance of opus and gpt4 for most tasks, with the only major difference probably arising in extremely difficult reasoning benchmarks. Since llama is open source, we're going to see fine tunes and LoRAs though, unlike opus. reply blackeyeblitzar 17 hours agorootparentLlama is open weight, not open source. They don’t release all the things you need to reproduce their weights. reply lumost 4 hours agorootparentHas anyone tested how close you need to be to the weights for copyright purposes? reply ktzar 38 minutes agorootparentpreveven if they released them, wouldn't it be prohibitively expensive to reproduce the weights? reply mananaysiempre 16 hours agorootparentprevNot really that either, if we assume that “open weight” means something similar to the standard meaning of “open source”—section 2 of the license discriminates against some users, and the entirety of the AUP against some uses, in contravention of FSD #0 (“The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose”) as well as DFSG #5&6 = OSD #5&6 (“No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups” and “... Fields of Endeavor”, the text under those titles is identical in both cases). Section 7 of the license is a choice of jurisdiction, which (in addition to being void in many places) I believe was considered to be against or at least skirting the DFSG in other licenses. At best it’s weight-available and redistributable. reply blackeyeblitzar 14 hours agorootparentThose are all great points and these companies need to really be called out for open washing reply amitport 4 hours agorootparentIt's a good balance IMHO.

Google's business is largely not predicated on AI the way everyone else is. Sure they hope it's a driver of growth, but if the entire LLM industry disappeared, they'd be fine. Google doesn't need AI \"Superiority\", they need \"good enough\" to prevent the masses from product switching. If the entire world is saturated in AI, then it no longer becomes a differentiator to drive switching. And maybe the arms race will die down, and they can save on costs trying to out-gun everyone else. reply gliched_robot 4 hours agorootparentprevDisagree on Nvidia, most folks fine-tune model. Proof: there are about 20k models in huggingface derived from llama 2, all of them trained on Nvidia GPUs. reply eggdaft 4 hours agorootparentFine tuning can take a fraction of the resources required for training, so I think the original point stands. reply nickthegreek 17 hours agoparentprevAnd they even allow you to use it without logging in.

They don't need you to login to get what they need, much like Google reply eggdaft 4 hours agorootparentDo they really need “free RLHF”? As I understand it, RLHF needs relatively little data to work and its quality matters - I would expect paid and trained labellers to do a much better job than Joey Keyboard clicking past a “which helped you more” prompt whilst trying to generate an email. reply spi 1 hour agorootparentVariety matters a lot. If you pay 1000 trained labellers, you get 1000 POVs for a good amount of money, and likely can't even think of 1000 good questions to have them ask. If you let 1000000 people give you feedback on random topics for free, and then pay 100 trained people to go through all of that and only retain the most useful 1%, you get much ten times more variety for a tenth of the cost. Of course numbers are pretty random, but it's just to give an idea of how these things scale. This is my experience from my company's own internal -deep learning but not LLM- models to train which we had to buy data instead of collecting it. If you can't tap into data \"from the wild\" -in our case, for legal reason- you can still get enough data (if measured in GB), but it's depressingly more repetitive, and that's not quite the same thing when you want to generalize. reply salil999 17 hours agorootparentprevI do see on the bottom left: Log in to save your conversation history, sync with Messenger, generate images and more. reply zitterbewegung 17 hours agorootparentThink they meant it can be used without login. reply lairv 17 hours agorootparentprevNot in the EU though reply sega_sai 16 hours agorootparentor the UK reply MichaelCharles 8 hours agorootparentprevBut not from Japan, and I assume most other non-English speaking countries. reply visarga 16 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't work for me, I'm in EU. reply mvkel 4 hours agorootparentProbably bc they're violating gdpr reply applecrazy 17 hours agorootparentprevI imagine that is to compete with ChatGPT, which began doing the same. reply unshavedyak 15 hours agorootparentprevWhich indicates that they get enough value out of logged ~in~ out users.

Over the coming months, we’ll release multiple models with new capabilities including multimodality, the ability to converse in multiple languages, a much longer context window, and stronger overall capabilities. reply glenstein 12 hours agorootparentAnyone have any informed guesstimations as to where we might expect a 400b parameter model for llama 3 to land benchmark wise and performance wise, relative to this current llama 3 and relative to GPT-4? I understand that parameters mean different things for different models, and llama two had 70 b parameters, so I'm wondering if anyone can contribute some guesstimation as to what might be expected with the larger model that they are teasing? reply ZiiS 11 hours agorootparentThey are aiming to beat the current GPT4 and stand a fair chance, they are unlikly to hold the crown for long. reply glenstein 10 hours agorootparentRight because the very little I've heard out of Sam Altman this year hinting at future updates suggests that there's something coming before we turn our calendars to 2025. So equaling or mildly exceeding GPT-4 will certainly be welcome, but could amount to a temporary stint as king of the mountain. reply llm_trw 5 hours agorootparentThis is always the case. But the fact that open models are beating state of the art from 6 months ago is really telling just how little moat there is around AI. reply ZiiS 34 minutes agorootparentFB are over $10B into AI.

The AI Act will significantly nerf the capabilities you will be allowed to benefit from in the eu. reply jokethrowaway 3 hours agorootparentprevIt is because of regulations. Nothing is trivial and anything has a cost. Not only it impacts existing businesses, it also make it harder for a struggling new business to compete with the current leaders. Regulations in the name of the users are actually just made to solidify the top lobbyists in their positions. The reasons I hate regulations is not because billionaires have to spend an extra week on some employee's salary, but because it makes it impossible for me tiny business to enter a new business due to the sheer complexity of it (or force me to pay more for someone else to handle it, think Paddle vs Stripe thanks to EU VATMOSS) I'm completely fine with giving away some usage data to get a free product, it's not like everyone is against it. I'd also prefer to be tracked without having to close 800 pop-ups a day. Draconian regulations like the EU ones destroy entire markets and force us to a single business model where we all need to pay with hard cash. reply viraptor 2 hours agorootparentYou didn't provide the source for the claim though. You're saying you think they made that choice because of regulations and what your issues are. That could well be true, but we really don't know. Maybe there's a more interesting reason.

Chinese authorities are also \"protecting their citiziens\".

(Even if you think they are protecting their citizens now, I actually disagree; blocking access to AI isn't protecting its citizens, it's handicapping them in the face of a rapidly-advancing world economy.) reply glenstein 11 hours agorootparent>China's central government also believes it is protecting its citizens. Anyone who's taking a course in epistemology can tell you that there's more to assessing veracity of a belief than noting its equivalence to other beliefs. There can be symmetry in psychology without symmetry in underlying facts. So noting an equivalence of belief is not enough to establish an equivalence in fact. I'm not even saying I'm for or against the EU's choices but I think the purpose of analogies to China is kind of rhetorical purpose of warning or a comparison intended to reflect negatively on the EU. I find it hard to imagine one would make a straight faced case that they are in fact equivalent in scope or scale or ambition or equivalent and their idea of the relation of their mission to their values for core liberties. I think the difference is here are clear enough that reasonable people should be able to make the case against AI regulation without losing grasp of the distinction between European and Chinese regulatory frameworks. reply medo-bear 3 hours agorootparentThe previous poster said that the EU is not restricting the freedom of its citizens, but protecting them (from themselves?). I fail to see how one can say that with a straight face.

A good test is, for example: solve a second degree equation for some random values of a, b and c. It's a very simple algorithm that all models have memorized, much simpler than a pong implementation, yet none of them are able to apply it and make silly mistakes, then lie their way out. Here's what LLAMA 3 had to say about it, after 15 or so prompts pointing out it's mistakes: > Please give me another chance to demonstrate my capabilities.

Not that I even want to make inference requests that would run afoul of the controls put in place by OpenAI and Anthropic (I mostly use it for coding stuff), but I hate the idea of this powerful technology being behind walls and having gate-keepers controlling how you can use it. Obviously, there are plenty of people and companies out there that also believe in the open approach. But they don't have hundreds of billions of dollars of capital and billions in sustainable annual cash flow and literally ten(s) of billions of dollars worth of GPUs! So it's a lot more impactful when they do it. And it basically sets the ground rules for everyone else, so that Mistral now also feels compelled to release model weights for most of their models. Anyway, Zuck didn't have to go this way. If Facebook were run by \"professional\" outside managers of the HBS/McKinsey ilk, I think it's quite unlikely that they would be this open with everything, especially after investing so much capital and energy into it. But I am very grateful that they are, and think we all benefit hugely from not only their willingness to be open and share, but also to not use pessimistic AI \"doomerism\" as an excuse to hide the crown jewels and put it behind a centralized API with a gatekeeper because of \"AI safety risks.\" Thanks Zuck! reply paxys 16 hours agoparentYou can see from Zuck's interviews that he is still an engineer at heart.

It attracts the world's best academic talent, who deeply want their work shared. AI experts can join any company, so ones which commit to open AI have a huge advantage. 2. Having armies of SWEs contributing millions of free labor hours to test/fix/improve/expand your stuff is incredible. 3. The industry standardizes around their tech, driving down costs and dramatically improving compatibility/extensibility. 4. It creates immense goodwill with basically everyone. 5. Having open AI doesn't hurt their core business. If you're an AI company, giving away your only product isn't tenable (so far). If Meta's 405B model surpasses GPT-4 and Claude Opus as they expect, they release it for free, and (predictably) nothing awful happens -- just incredible unlocks for regular people like Llama 2 -- it'll make much of the industry look like complete clowns. Hiding their models with some pretext about safety, the alarmist alignment rhetoric, will crumble. Like...no, you zealously guard your models because you want to make money, and that's fine. But using some holier-than-thou \"it's for your own good\" public gaslighting is wildly inappropriate, paternalistic, and condescending. The 405B model will be an enormous middle finger to companies who literally won't even tell you how big their models are (because \"safety\", I guess).

That's what pundits say, most of whom love pointing out big failures more than they like thinking deeply. He sees the metaverse as the entire shared online space that evolves into a more multi-user collaborative model with more human-centric input/output devices than a computer and phone. It includes co-presence, mixed reality, social sites like Instagram and Facebook as well as online gaming, real-world augments, multiuser communities like Roblox, and \"world apps\" like VRChat or Horizons. Access methods may be via a VR headset, or smart glasses, or just sensors that alert you to nearby augmented sites that you can then access on your phone - think Pokemon Go with gyms located at historical real-world sites. That's what $50B has been spent on, and it's definitely a work in progress. But it sure doesn't seem dead based on the fact that more Quest headsets have been sold than this gen's Xboxes; Apple released Vision Pro; Rayban Smart Glasses are selling pretty well; new devices are planned from Google, Valve, and others; and remote work is an unkillable force.

Software engineers didn't need these bubble-inflated salaries to acheive that. Like our peers in other engineering disciplines, it's practically our baseline state.

I'm more than ok with willing investors (potentially) losing capital they put at risk. Just don't put some captive public retirement fund or task payer money into this. Those investors are grown up and rich, they don't need us to know better what is good for them. > Workers don't win progress when they're lured into then converting that income into impractical home loans that bind the workers with golden handcuffs and darkly shadow their future when the bubble bursts. This says more about carefully managing the maximum amount of leverage you want to take on in your life. It's hardy an argument that would convince me that lower pay is better for me. People freak out when thinking about putting leverage in their stock portfolio, but they take on a mortgage on a house without thinking twice. Even though getting out of a well diversified stock portfolio and remove all the leverage takes less than half an hour these days (thanks to online brokers), but selling your single concentrated illiquid house can take months and multiple percentage points of transaction costs (agents, taxes, etc). Just don't buy a house, or at least buy within your means. And make sure you are thinking ahead of time how to get out of that investment, in case things turn sour. > Workers win progress when they can practice their trade with respect and freedom and can and secure a stable, secure future for themselves and their families. Guess who's in a good negotiation position to demand respect and freedom and stability from their (prospective) employer? Someone who has other lucrative offers. Money is one part of compensation, freedom and respect (and even fun!) are others. Your alternative offers don't all have to offer these parts of the package in the same proportions. You can use a rich offer with lots of money from place A, to try and get more freedom (at a lower pay) from place B. Though I find that in practice that the places that are valuing me enough to pay me a lot, also tend to value me enough to give me more respect and freedom. (It's far from a perfect correlation, of course.) > Software engineers didn't need these bubble-inflated salaries to acheive that. Yes, have lived on a pittance before, and survived. I don't strictly 'need' the money. But I still firmly believe that all else being equal that 'more money = more better'. > What fight we do still need to make is on securing non-monetary worker's rights and professional deference, [...]. I'd rather take the money, thank you. If you want to fight, please go ahead, but don't speak for me.

It's up to the workers themselves to decide whether that's a good deal. And I'm not sure why as a worker you would decide to rot? If someone pays me a lot to put in a token effort, just so I don't work for the competition, I might happily take that over and practice my trumpet playing while 'working from home'.

In the most usual case you fuel price dumping in one market by profits from the other.

Browser market is dead up to this date. > And I'm not sure why as a worker you would decide to rot? If someone pays me a lot to put in a token effort, just so I don't work for the competition, I might happily take that over and practice my trumpet playing while 'working from home'.

Not unless that someone sits on the ads money pipe. > Please provide some examples What kind of example do you expect? If it helps, half the people I personally know in Google \"practice the trumpet\" in your words. Situation is slowly improving though in the past two years. I'm not saying it should be made illegal.

I want the tech industry to move forward, not the amateur trumpet one. reply eru 21 minutes agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing says > For a period of time, the prices are set unrealistically low to ensure competitors are unable to effectively compete with the dominant firm without making substantial loss. The aim is to force existing or potential competitors within the industry to abandon the market so that the dominant firm may establish a stronger market position and create further barriers to entry.[2] Once competition has been driven from the market, consumers are forced into a monopolistic market where the dominant firm can safely increase prices to recoup its losses.[3] What you are describing is not predatory pricing, that's a big part of why I was confused. > Funnily enough the second author got a good example but still failed to see it under his nose: public schools do have 90% of the market, and in many countries almost 100%. Obviously it works. Please consider reading the article more carefully. Your interpretation requires the author to be an idiot. --- What you are describing about browsers is interesting. But it's more like bundling and cross subsidies. Neither Microsoft nor Google were ever considering making money from raising the price of their browser after competition had been driven out. That's required for predatory pricing. reply latexr 2 hours agorootparentprev> Fortunately, or unfortunately, that has the side effect of eg paying veterinary nurses peanuts, because there's always people willing to do those kinds of 'cute' jobs. Veterinaries (including technicians) have an absurdly high rate of suicide. They have a stressful job, constantly around death and mistreatment situations, and don’t get the respect (despite often knowing more than human doctors) or the salaries to match. Calling these jobs “cute” or saying the veterinary situation is “fortunate” borders on cruel, but I believe you were just uninformed. reply eru 28 minutes agorootparentYet, people still line up to become veterinaries (and technicians). Which proves my point. > Calling these jobs “cute” or saying the veterinary situation is “fortunate” borders on cruel, [...] Perhaps not the best choice of words, I admit. reply latexr 3 minutes agorootparent> Yet, people still line up to become veterinaries (and technicians). Which proves my point. The informed reality is that the rate of drop out is also huge. Not only from people who leave the course while studying, but also veterinaries who abandon the field entirely after just a few years of work. Many of them are already suffering in college yet continue due to a sense of necessity or sunk cost and burn themselves out. So no, it does not prove your point. The one thing it proves is that the public in general is insufficiently informed about what being a veterinary is like. asadm 15 hours agorootparentprevI am fine with large pool of greedy people trying their hand at programming.

While it sucks for SWE, I actually kind of agree. The skyrocketing of SWE salary in the US, and the slow progress US is making towards normalizing/reducing it does not help US competitiveness. I would not fault Meta for this though, as much as US society at large. SWE should enjoy it while they can before salary becomes similar to other engineering trades. reply maxsilver 13 hours agorootparentprev> but driving software engineer salaries out of reach of otherwise profitable, sustainable businesses is not a good thing. I'm not convinced he's actually done that. Pretty much any 'profitable, sustainable business' can afford software developers. Software developers are paid pretty decently, but (grabbing a couple of lists off of Google) it looks like there's 18 careers more lucrative than it (from a wage perspective), and computers-in-general are only 3 of the top 25 highest paying careers - https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-pay... Medical, Legal, Finance, and Sales as careers (roughly in that order) all seem to pay more on average. reply swatcoder 13 hours agorootparentFew viable technology businesses and non-technology busiesses with internal software departments were prepared to see their software engineers suddenly suddenly expect doctor or lawyer pay and can't effectively accomodate the change. They were largely left to rely on loyalty and other kinds of fragile non-monetary factors to preserve their existing talent and institutuonal knowledge and otherwise scavenge for scraps when making new hires. For those companies outside the specific Silicon Valley money circle, it was an extremely disruptive change and recovery basically requires that salaries normalize to some significant degree. In most cases, engineers provide quite a lot of value but not nearly so much value as FAANG and SV speculators could build into their market-shaping offers. It's not a healthy situation for the industry or (if you're wary of centralization/monopolization) society as a whole. reply ghaff 12 hours agorootparentIn general, it's probably not sustainable (with some exceptions like academia that have never paid that well leaving aside the top echelon and that had its own benefits) to expect that engineering generally lags behind SV software engineering. Especially with some level of remote persisting, presumably salaries/benefits equilibrate to at least some degree. reply ponector 11 hours agorootparentprevThat business can search and find talents globally for fraction of SV salary. If FAANG company can hire an engineer overseas for 60k$ annually why other cannot? reply swatcoder 10 hours agorootparentBecause maintaining the organizational infrastructure to coordinate remote teams dispersed to time zones all over the world and with different communication styles, cultural assumptions, and legal requirements is a whole matter of its own? Companies that can do that are at an advantage over those who can't right now, but pulling that off is neither trivial nor immediate nor free. reply aworks 7 hours agorootparentI worked for a company that was very good at that. It resulted in software organizations in 50+ countries. I had teams in North American, Europe, Russia and East Asia. It resulted in a diversified set of engineers who were close to our customers (except in Russia where the engineers were highly qualified but few prospects for sales). Managing across cultures and time zones is a competence. Jet lag from travel was not as great... reply mschuster91 15 hours agorootparentprevA person (or a company) can be two very different things at the same time. It's undeniable as you say that there have been a lot of high-profile open source innovations coming from Facebook (ReactJS, LLaMA, HHVM, ...), but the price that society at large paid for all of this is not insignificant either, and Meta hasn't meaningfully apologized for the worst of it. reply xpe 6 hours agoparentprev> but also to not use pessimistic AI \"doomerism\" as an excuse to hide the crown jewels and put it behind a centralized API with a gatekeeper because of \"AI safety risks.\" AI safety risk is substantial. It is also testable. (There are prediction markets on it, for example.) Of course, some companies may latch onto various valid arguments for insincere reasons. I'd challenge everyone to closely compare ideas such as \"open source software is better\" versus \"state of the art trained AI models are better developed in the open\". The exact same arguments do NOT work for both. It is one thing to publish papers about e.g. transformers. It is another thing to publish the weights of something like GPT 3.5+; it might theoretically be a matter of degree, but that matter of degree makes a real difference, if only in terms of time. Time matters because it gives people and society some time to respond. Software security reports are often made privately or embargoed. Why? We want to give people and companies time to defend their systems. Now consider this thought-experiment: assume LLMs (and their hybrid derivatives) enable perhaps 1,000,000 new kinds of cyberattacks, 1,000 new bioweapon attacks, and so on. Are there are a correspondingly large number of defensive benefits? This is the crux of the question I think. First, I don't expect we're going to get a good assessment of the overall \"balance\". Second, any claims of \"balance\" are beside the point, because these attacks and defenses don't simply cancel each other out. The distribution of the AI-fueled capability advance will probably ratchet up risk and instability. Open source software's benefits stem from the assumption that bugs get shallower with more eyes. More eyes means that the open source product gets stronger defensively. With LLMs that publish their weights, both the research and the implementations is out; you can't get guardrails. The closest analogue to an \"OSS security report\" would take the form of \"I just got your LLM to design a novel biological weapon. Do you think you can use it to design an antidote?\" A systematic risk-averse person might want to ask: what happens if we enumerate all offensive vs defensive technological shifts? Should we reasonably believe that the benefits outweigh the risks? Unfortunately, the companies making these decisions aren't bearing the risks. This huge externality both pisses me off and scares the shit out of me. reply insane_dreamer 14 hours agoparentprevCall me cynical, but it was the only way not to be outplayed by OpenAI and to compete with Google, etc. reply danielmarkbruce 14 hours agorootparent100%.

They've made it harder for competitors like Google or TikTok to compete with Meta on the basis of \"we have a super secret proprietary AI that no one else has that's leagues better than anything else\".

We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome. No current LLM is that, and Transformers may always be too sample-expensive for that. But if anyone does make such a thing, OpenAI won't mind… so long as the AI is \"safe\" (whatever that means). OpenAI has been totally consistent with saying that safety includes assuming weights are harmful until proven safe because you cannot un-release a harmful model; Other researchers say the opposite, on the grounds that white-box research is safety research is easier and more consistent. I lean towards the former, not because I fear LLMs specifically, but because the irreversibly and the fact we don't know how close or far we are means it's a habit we should turn into a norm before it's urgent. reply mirekrusin 14 hours agorootparentprev...like open balloon. reply noiseinvacuum 15 hours agorootparentprevHe went into the details of how he thinks about open sourcing weights for Llama responding to a question from an analyst in one of the earnings call last year after Llama release. I had made a post on Reddit with some details. https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/s/GK57eB2qiz Some noteworthy quotes that signal the thought process at Meta FAIR and more broadly * We’re just playing a different game on the infrastructure than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon * We would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that. * ...lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools * Open sourcing low level tools make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. * On PyTorch: It’s generally been very valuable for us to provide that because now all of the best developers across the industry are using tools that we’re also using internally. * I would expect us to be pushing and helping to build out an open ecosystem. reply FrustratedMonky 14 hours agorootparent\"different game\" But what game? What is the AI play that makes giving it away a win for meta? reply saratogacx 12 hours agorootparentA lot of the other companies are selling AI as a service. Meta hasn't really been in the space of selling a raw service in that way. However, they are at a center point of human interaction that few can match. In this space, it is how they can leverage those models to enhance that and make that experience better that can be where they win. (Think of, for example, giving a summery of what you've missed in your groups, letting you join more and still know what's happening without needing to shift through it all, identifying events and activities happening that you'd be interested in. This will make it easier to join more groups as the cost of being in one is less, driving more engagement). For facebook, it isn't the technology, but how it is applied, is where their game starts to get interesting. When you give away the tooling and treat it as first class, you'll get the wider community improving it on top of your own efforts, cycle that back into the application of it internally and you now have a positive feedback loop where other, less open models, lack one. reply dumbfounder 13 hours agorootparentprevWeaken the competition (google and ms).

He created a thing called Facebook that was wildly successful. Built it with his own two hands. We all know this. But what is less understood is that from his point of view, Facebook went through a near death experience when mobile happened. Apple and Google nearly \"stole\" it from him by putting strict controls around the next platform that happened, mobile. He lives every day even still knowing Apple or Google could simply turn off his apps and the whole dream would come to an end. So what do you do in that situation? You swear - never again. When the next revolution happens, I'm going to be there, owning it from the ground up myself. But more than that, he wants to fundamentally shift the world back to the premise that made him successful in the first place - open platforms. He thinks that when everyone is competing on a level playing field he'll win. He thinks he is at least as smart and as good as everyone else. The biggest threat to him is not that someone else is better, it's that the playing field is made arbitrarily uneven. Of course, this is all either conjecture or pieced together from scraps of observations over time. But it is very consistent over many decisions and interactions he has made over many years and many different domains. reply tinyspacewizard 15 hours agorootparentprevI think what Meta is doing is really smart. We don't really know where AI will be useful in a business sense yet (the apps with users are losing money) but a good bet is that incumbent platforms stand to benefit the most once these uses are discovered. What Meta is doing is making it easier for other orgs to find those use-cases (and take on the risk) whilst keeping the ability to jump in and capitalize on it when it materializes. As for X-Risk? I don't think any of the big tech leadsership actually beleive in that. I also think that deep down a lot of the AI safety crowd love solving hard problems and collecting stock options.

If they can empower more people to create more content more quickly, they make more money.

There's a lot you can do with multimodal intelligent agents! Even if they share the models themselves, they will have insights into how to best use and serve those models efficiently and at scale.

Based on the behavior, nature, stated beliefs and interviews I've seen of most tech CEOs and CEOs in general, there seems to be almost a natural aversion to talking about things in non hyper-abstracted terms. I get the feeling that the nature of the corporate world is often better understood as a series of rituals to create the illusion of the necessity of the capitalist hierarchy itself. (not that this is exclusive to capitalism, this exists in politics and any system that becomes somewhat self-sustaining) More important than a company doing well is the capacity to use the company as an image/lifestyle enhancement tool for those at the top. So many companies run almost mindlessly as somewhat autonomous machines, allowing pretense and personal egoic myth-making to win over the purpose of the company in the first place. I think this is why Elon, Mark, Jensen, etc. have done so well. They don't perceive their position as founder/CEOs as a class position: a level above the normal lot that requires a lack of caring for tangible matters. They see their companies as ways of making things happen, for better or for worse. reply charlie0 6 hours agorootparentIt's because Elon, Mark, and Jensen are true founders. They aren't MBAs who got voted in because shareholders thought they would make them the most money in the shortest amount of time. reply FrustratedMonky 15 hours agoparentprevIt does seem uncharacteristic. Wonder how much of the hate Zuck gets is people that just don't like Facebook, but as person/engineer, his heart is in the right place?

    "originBody": "Why you need a \"WTF Notebook\" There's a very specific reputation I want to have on a team: \"Nat helps me solve my problems. Nat get things I care about done.\" Photo by Glenn Carstens-Peters / Unsplash I keep a bullet journal. I'm not one of those people you see on Pinterest with the fancy spreads – I mostly just use black ink, the standard setup, and the occasional custom collection. Every time I join a new team, I go to the next fresh page, and on top of that page I write: \"WTF - [Team Name].\" Then I make a note every time I run into something that makes me go \"wtf,\" and a task every time I come up with something I want to change. For two weeks, that's all I do. I just write it down. I don't tell the team everything that I think they're doing wrong. I don't show up at retro with all the stuff I think they need to change. I just watch, and listen, and I write down everything that seems deeply weird. This is a trick I picked up from a team lead a few years ago, who learned it from a previous lead of his in turn. It's one of my most powerful techniques for making changes on a team, and managing myself while I do it. So I'm going to walk you through how I use that list, and how it helps me to build a reputation as someone who's really effective at getting stuff done, and avoid being someone who's complaining all the time. There's always stuff that makes me go \"wtf\" on a new team. The team talks for an hour in retro about a serious problem, and then leaves without making any action items. The tests don't run locally and no one seems to notice. Big chunks of the build board are always red. Only one person can do some critical, time-sensitive thing. The team is spending a bunch of time on some feature, but when I ask around no one can seems to know why it's important or how it'll help a customer. Once I've got a nice big list, I start crossing things off. There are four reasons at this point that I might cross off something I've put on that list: There's actually a good reason for it The team is already working on a fix The team doesn't care about it It's really easy to fix If the tests don't run locally, for instance, that might be a known issue that there's an ongoing effort to address. The team might do all of their work on virtual machines, and have a simple chat command that provisions those machines for them. Or they might have a pretty good continuous integration system and good habits around making small changes, so not being able to run the tests locally isn't stopping them from deploying multiple times a day. Sometimes, it'll turn out that there's a really simple fix for some of the things I've identified. Maybe there's some documentation I can write, once I know where it is, or maybe there's an easy change once I find the right scripts. That's not always immediately obvious when I first see a problem. When I do see an easy fix, though, I'll just go ahead and make it. After a few weeks, though, I'll still have a bunch of weird, unresolved issues on that list. At this point I'll start talking about it with other people on the team, the team lead, and my manager. I'll ask why things on the list are that way, and how they got to be that way. I'm trying to establish credibility as someone who's genuinely curious and empathetic, who's patient, and who respects the expertise of my coworkers. That's the reputation that's going to let me make changes later. Generally, I'll find out that the things that problems I've noticed are around for one of a few reasons. The team hasn't noticed it The team has gotten used to it The problem is relatively new, and the old problem it replaced was much worse They don't know how to fix the problem They've tried to fix the problem before and failed On a lot of teams, when I ask some questions about things that turn out to be in the first few questions, the person I ask will just fix them immediately. Or they'll help me figure out how to fix them. If it's a technical problem, that means writing a story or a ticket together, and then we'll work on it. If it's more process or social, it means bringing the problem up at retro and talking about it with the whole team. At this point I'm looking for one or two problems that have been bugging one of my new teammates for a while, and that have relatively simple solutions. I'm looking for something I can put on the retro board and know I won't be the only person who's bothered by that problem. Then, during the team conversation about the problem, I'll identify something that teammate suggests as an action item that we could try immediately. That way the team starts to see me as someone who helps them solve their problems. The feeling that I want to create, the association I want people to have with me, is, \"Oh, Nat joined the team and little things started to get better, almost immediately. It feels like we're starting to make some progress. And it's not like they showed up and started telling me what to do, either. They're really listening to me, they're helping me explain myself to the rest of the team.\" Pretty soon, I'll start to get in to the really sticky issues. The problems the team knows about but is afraid of dealing with. The things that aren't \"that bad,\" but that no one wants to talk about. Maybe they're missing the technical skills to deal with the problem. Maybe there's a knotty people problem at the center of it. At this point I'm going to be talking to my manager. I'm going to bring them that list I've been working on, and I'm going to say something like, \"Now that I've been on the team for a few weeks, this is what I'm seeing. We're making progress on some of it, but some of these seem like they're going to take longer. I wanted to get your thoughts before I try to do anything about them. Is there something I'm missing? Is there a particular area I'd like you to focus?\" The reaction I'm looking for from my manager, at this point, is something like, \"Wow. This is really validating. I've been concerned about these things but the team doesn't seem really bothered by them, so I didn't want to push too hard. I'm glad you're bringing this up.\" Then we can have a conversation about what their concerns and problems are. I can do some reflective listening to help them organize their thoughts, and I can talk about what I've seen work well, or not, in the past. They'll start to see me as someone with good judgement, and someone they can come to for help solving their harder problems. There's a very specific reputation I want to have on a team: \"Nat helps me solve my problems. Nat get things I care about done.\" That's the reputation that's going to get me the results I want in next year's performance review. That's the reputation that's going to get me a referral a few years from now. Before I started keeping this kind of list, I brought up problem I saw immediately, as soon as I noticed it. The reputation I got was, \"Nat's always complaining about things. Nat thinks we're never doing things right.\" People stopped listening to me. I was personally frustrated, and professionally ineffective. There's no faster way to totally sink my credibility, as a new team member, by making a huge fuss over something that's not a problem, or that the team doesn't see as a problem, or that there's already an effort to fix, or that there's a really simple way to fix that I just didn't see at first. There are always so many problems on a team, so many things that could be better, that I'm only ever going to solve a handful of them. Working on problems in the order I noticed them is rarely the most effective order. So the WTF Notebook gives me a place to park the impulse to fix it now, damn it! until I have more context for deciding what to work on first. Instead, for two weeks, I just write things down.

Becoming blind to weird quirks of your own product is the equivalent of a senior professor becoming blind to the fact that the stuff they need to explain is hard to fresh students. The thing is, that not all people suck equally bad at this. A big part of it is to actually care and be empathic enough to put yourself into the shoes of the un-initiated. Two people who both have used the Bash shell a million times might have a completely different understanding of what makes it weird and unintuitive to someone starting out, even if both had trouble when they themselves did. Looking at things with a fresh mind is a skill one can get better at, just like you can learn how to look at actual light and objects to draw what you see instead of drawing what your brain tells you you see. It is a hard thing to learn and it is something that can fail you even once you became somewhat decent at it, but every good educator needs that skill. reply _carbyau_ 7 hours agoparentprevI think TFA is more stressing that this only \"new\" once perspective can lead you to exclaiming WTF a lot to all your new colleagues - thus giving the impression of being a loud complaining nuisance. Instead, by writing it down and NOT expressing it just yet, you give yourself time to learn the lie of the land and why things are the way they are; to orient yourself in the workplace. And when you are comfortable, settled with accounts/permissions/authorisations, you have a nice list to move on. The team is then more likely to think you are being helpful rather than a popup muppet exclaiming \"WTF is that!\" all the time. reply pjdesno 15 hours agoparentprevI worked at a tiny self-funded startup once where we required new hires to update the documentation and processes to fix the problems they encountered during onboarding.

Both of these steps were crucial. The presentation serves a ton of purposes, it ensures both the student and the teacher learn the material enough to present with a whiteboard, and the team can catch any mistakes or misunderstandings at a time when they'd have the most sympathy towards ignorance. It also is a good low-stakes way to force someone to present and get used to the team and talk to everyone in a formal setting.

But I expect starting a journal like this, waiting for a list to grow, is also a great path to resensitizing oneself to all the potentially useful problems to solve. Writing down something and then waiting is such an immediate, low effort/immediate reward (my list got longer!), but long-term high-payoff act, I think it can be easily relearned with a systematic practice like this. I like the continuous separation of recognition and recording, from the downstream progression: Create a map (see), take time to study it (learn), form a party of the co-concerned (lead), before running off into the forrest. reply HenryBemis 12 hours agorootparentI recently interviewed with a mega-big bank for a role that I 'got it'/I have the 20y of experience on the thing.

First of all many places I’ve worked were deluding themselves about the feasibility of doing this. Their onboarding process inhibited any such wishes when I started there. I’ve been doing user studies on developers for more than a dozen years. It got a lot easier once screen sharing was more common. But letting new hires or devs with brand new machines twist a little when going through the setup docs and taking notes. Or doing similar when I’ve made a major change or introduced a new API to see what fresh eyes see that I did not (or in some cases, that which was true but no longer is). If at all possible I task them with fixing the docs. First, as you say, they don’t have the Curse of Knowledge, so how they word it will reach down the ladder behind them. Second, if what they say is completely wrong, then I can correct the miscommunication easier when they’ve used their own words to repeat back what we discussed.

Often it is your personal opinion (the perspective itself) that is both right and wrong. I think the greatest mistake in software design is the pattern of structuring UI/UX around assumptions. Every assumption made in software design is a demand for the context that that software will be used. The reality is that context will always be fluid, and that it will often contradict itself. Free software can be liberated from its assumptions, but it requires redundant work for every unique contextualization. reply Havoc 15 hours agoprev>There's a very specific reputation I want to have on a team: \"Nat helps me solve my problems.

For starters, at that company, I always fortunate to have a manager that had my back when it came to deflecting requests that didn't come from him or her. If a random person reached out to me with a request to do some non-trivial work that I either didn't have the bandwidth or interest to do, all I had to say was, \"Sorry but I don't have the time to look into this right now. If you need this prioritized, please run it by my manager.\" 99 times of 100, my manager never heard from them. The biggest upside to being the go-to guy for people across the department/company is that you get to collect acquaintances and contacts. It's a fun little micro-superpower. Extremely valuable when you need some bit of info from someone outside your team, or need someone to cut through some red tape to get something important done.

I'm trying to establish credibility as someone who's genuinely curious and empathetic, who's patient, and who respects the expertise of my coworkers. That's the reputation that's going to let me make changes later. I would not try to establish credibility, but earn it. I will not try to be genuinely curious or empathetic.

I'm looking for something I can put on the retro board and know I won't be the only person who's bothered by that problem. This screams to me as playing the work game. If someone can spend time looking for problems over their coworker shoulders or \"something to put on the retro board\" it just means they are out of meaningful tasks to do. > Then, during the team conversation about the problem, I'll identify something that teammate suggests as an action item that we could try immediately. That way the team starts to see me as someone who helps them solve their problems. Change the context and this sounds like a pickup artist explaining dating tricks, or a con man telling you how to infiltrate or someone on the secret service trying to enter a gang. > The feeling that I want to create, the association I want people to have with me, is, \"Oh, Nat joine [...] Feelings are not something one goes around creating unless they are actively manipulating people around. > There's a very specific reputation I want to have on a team: \"Nat helps me solve my problems.

I could keep going on, but I think these are enough examples reply heisenzombie 12 hours agorootparentI think your reaction is common, your mindset is one that I recognize in myself and causes me many insecurities in relationships both personal and professional. However, it's worth saying that: Being intentional about relationships is not manipulation. If I decide \"I want to be a better husband\" and then spend time noticing and writing down a list of things that my wife says bother her or would make her happy or she thinks would be romantic, and then I go through and choose some of them and set myself reminders in my calendar to do them... Am I \"manipulating\" my wife into \"thinking\" I'm a better husband? Or am I just plain being a better husband? Would it be worse if I got the idea from a book titled Would it be better if, instead of being so intentional, I just let my passions and romance sweep me into doing romantic things without any conscious thought? Why? To make my point clear: Being very intentional about relationships (how others perceive and feel about you — and what actions you take to make them feel and perceive you that way) is not manipulation. If I act in a way that makes my coworkers think that I'm a good coworker, then I AM a good coworker! The fact that it was on purpose and not accidental is...? Manipulation happens when you develop your \"be-a-good-coworker\" skills (which is good) and then use those skills in a way that intentionally hurts your coworkers or makes them act against their interests (which is bad). I see evidence in the article of the first but not the second. reply AriedK 11 hours agorootparentIt's a fine line. Maybe it isn't necessarily manipulation, but it does come off as disingenuous to me. To take your marriage example. The genuine motivation would be: \"I acknowledge my flaws and I'm willing to put in the effort to change myself for the benefit of my wife\". If the motivation is to just tweak your wife's views of you, that may not be manipulation but it's not very loving either. People will be able to sniff out if the goal of his behaviour is to have people think of him a certain way, versus having the goal of wanting to bring beneficial change and helping a team out. The behaviour may be the same on the surface, but the intent is very different. I would be very wary of judging people's motivations, but the fact that the author explicitly mentions it bothers me. reply richk449 6 hours agorootparentThe Turing test for husbands: determine if your husband is actually a good person or if he is acting like a good person so that you will love and appreciate him. reply heisenzombie 7 hours agorootparentprevYou say the genuine motivation would be: \"I acknowledge my flaws and I'm willing to put in the effort to change myself for the benefit of my wife\" But... How do I know which actions will \"benefit\" my wife? I argue that one of the best ways to know is to ask myself: \"Will this action make her feel positively about me?\". That way, I'm not going to do things that are important to me but not her, or that I think she SHOULD appreciate but she doesn't actually care about, or whatever. Of course, to answer that question accurately requires plenty of listening, understanding and empathy. In the past, I thought more like you. But I think it harmed me. Ultimately I came to the conclusion that intentionally doing things so that other people like to be around you isn't \"disingenuous\", it's a wonderful thing to work towards! reply hoc 2 hours agorootparentprevFor some this might have a bit of sociopathic creepiness to it which even seems more apparent in that marriage context than it does in the original article of an \"deeply\" structured coder. Of course control might be a valid goal, and controlling your need to control might be a good meta step, too, in a professional environment. The issue of the line between caring and controlling just seems not been discussed enough. And not seeing and mentioning that obvious emotional aspect might already make it look a bit weird. reply jptlnk 10 hours agorootparentprevWithout imputing any actual intention to the author, I agree with your points on tone. It feels focused on optics, not outcomes. It's one thing to say that you want to get things done. It's another to say you want to be _seen_ as someone who gets things done. Again, I don't intend to mind read here, and I think the author actually has some really good data gathering ideas. But the language definitely smacks of political motivation, which some folks (myself included) find off-putting. reply Vegenoid 13 hours agorootparentprevI don't agree. You should only do things that benefit the team if they are done out of a true sense of cameraderie, and pure desire to empathize and solve problems? Not everyone has natural empathy, and people who don't have it learning how to do it in a way that benefits them and the people around them is positive. Re:'It sounds like a con artist', the techniques for getting people to trust and like you are often the same whether your intent is good or bad. I don't think these techniques should be reserved for people who have an innate wellspring of curiosity and cooperation. This person is trying to earn credibility, and is specifically focused on the 'new' phase of being on a team, when you do not have a big pile of meaningful tasks yet and your primary goal is getting the lay of the land and establishing good relationships with your teammates. Finally, > Feelings are not something one goes around creating unless they are actively manipulating people around. I don't really understand what this means. I create feelings all the time, intentionally and unintentionally. I often do things where the primary purpose is to make somebody feel good, usually things like 'make some effort to solve a problem that I don't think matters' or 'let somebody explain something to me that I already know about'. It's not about gaining power and status, it's about greasing social wheels and making friendly cooperation easier. Am I 'manipulating' people? Well, I am often trying to influence them so that they act in a way that I believe will benefit both of us. I do want to rise in my career, but I want to do it by making positive impacts and relationships, not by stepping on others. I don't think that's a bad thing. reply EVyesnoyesnoyes 1 hour agorootparentprevHe thinks about those types of things and are acting on it (which is the key point in my opinion) because he is someone who thinks about those types of things. I think thats a very good attitude. reply cess11 2 hours agorootparentprevI get where you're coming from, but in a somewhat large or large organisation the organisation has a life of its own and it couldn't care less whether you're authentically you or not. If there is something to gain from throwing you out it will, regardless of how you feel about it. Hedging against that with conscious social strategies can be a reasonable thing to do, at least if you are in or are likely to end up in such a large organisation. I've made the choice to be in a small organisation, in part because my contributions don't need packaging and announcements to become known to those with more power in it than I have. If I were to change my mind and join a large organisation I wouldn't think twice about entertaining a 'game', balancing the degree to which I exploit other people and organisational weaknesses to gain money and stability for myself against a semblance of professional and personal ethics. reply lopatin 14 hours agorootparentprevNot the parent, but what bothers me is how the author tries to spin the idea of taking notes when you're new as something profound. He even gives it a catchy name \"WTF Notebook\". And the connection between creating a reputation of a fixer at the company, and taking notes with a WTF journal, is weak. I usually don't like to hate on articles like this and instead ignore them, but since you asked, it mostly sounds like bullshit to me. reply strken 10 hours agorootparentI think there's a strong connection between identifying and fixing problems, and between fixing problems and getting a reputation as a fixer. reply colonwqbang 12 hours agorootparentprevWriting things down and thinking them over before acting on them, isn't bullshit. There's other decent advice in the article. I think your review of the article is overly negative. Perhaps these techniques come naturally to some people, and others need to learn it by instruction? I'm in the latter camp. I often need to think about how I sound and make sure I don't come across as too negative. reply dogman144 12 hours agoparentprevYou hit on the most interesting aspect from this. I will explain what I noticed and I’m interested in how this viewpoint lands. First, the author is doing 101 new leadership stuff. I’ve done it, I’ve seen it done, there’s a science to it. I can distill the whole blog post into when taking over leading something (as an experienced IC, as a new manager, as an army officer, it’s all the same), take the first 30-90 days to not change anything, and just seek to understand how and more relevantly why things work. There are a mess of organization benefits to this, it would take more than a comment to explain why. But in short, ya this is how it’s done. Second, engs have worked for awful managers, can’t often understand or exactly place why but they know their manager sucks. I can argue capably in thread about how often this difficult to explain “sh*ty manager” sense boils down to the manager not doing like tactically good leadership. In the same way as engineering is a taught skill, so is leading teams. Issue is only a few places teach it intentionally. Top of mind for me is the military, and senior exec training. There’s an actual science to it, full stop. You either get taught it by orgs that treat it this way, or you pick it up from a mentor who learned it somehow. Note - the author learned it this second way. This is really common. Third, to work for good managers, you actually want to work for good leaders. Leadership is a tactical skill, the same way efficient lines of C++ are. Leadership tactical means tactically shaping and steering people to achieve a goal greater than the sum of the team’s individual parts. This full stop requires what in a certain light is what you point out - it’s a bit manipulative feeling. It’s using leadership methods to make people work together in a way that is effective. A lot of this is good EQ and stuff like the author maps out. So, who do engs like working for? Often it’s working for technically inclined good people who go to bat for their team with external parties, shield their team from stupid stuff, resource the team to complete its goals, praise in public criticize in private, give good but not overly micromanaging guidance on where to steer things, recognizes and rewards performance, holds unperforners to a standard, and so on and so on? Some examples of who knows how to do this but for the wrong reasons are people engs don’t like working for - to stereotype: charismatic jocks out of MBA programs who can know nothing about tech but know corp politics and deploy this stuff tactically. Who do engs hate working for often - technical hires promoted into management and they hate/are bad at their jobs bc management != tech chops, as my above covered. So, what that leaves is a scenario where teams are led by the occasional person that inherently knows good leadership chops, or more often it’s pissed off engineers who hate working for someone manipulative or incompetent. To raise the collective industry odds that tech teams work for skilled and competent leaders, that leaves as the solution spelling out tactical leadership - how to do it, what it looks like, how people fit into it, like this blog does. Pick your poison - more of the same, or good people who just need clear guidance learning from resources like this on how to run teams people want to work on? HN certainly complains to no end about the dynamic caused by not approaching leadership as a skill vs some nebulous thing people somehow know how to do. reply tibbar 7 hours agorootparentI think you nailed it here. It's important to internalize that being a good employee (and/or leader) is not a virtue, it is a skill. You can be a good person and a bad employee/teammate/leader. A bad employee in the sense that you're letting other people down, and/or a bad employee in the sense that you're not getting paid appropriately or getting denied opportunities. Your job is a really important part of your life - and you will also affect a lot of other people. It's important to be a bit strategic. Otherwise, even if you have wonderful intentions, there's a great chance you'll work on things that don't matter and that leadership knows nothing about, until your career quietly fizzles out. reply d0gsg0w00f 11 hours agoparentprevYeah, my first thought was \"how often does this guy change jobs?\" reply ergonaught 16 hours agoprevThat is roughly how I've approached things whenever I'm walking into a pre-existing situation. I spend the first week just reviewing everything and writing down questions/observations, etc. Not only the \"WTF\" moments, though.

Then there's some time to review/prioritize/etc before any sort of discussions. reply hi_hi 9 hours agoprev> Before I started keeping this kind of list, I brought up problem I saw immediately, as soon as I noticed it.

This level of self awareness is a real skill that is worth mastering. The ex astronaut Chris Hadfield talks about a similar approach he used when joining new missions and teams in his book.

Still handy to note them down, regardless. reply NiagaraThistle 14 hours agoprevWow. I was just telling 2 co-workers this week that I keep a \"How the F\" file on my machine. It is not exactly what the author describes, but it's very similar and includes all the \"how th f do i do this thing again?\" every time I run into a problem when I'm new to a team. I don't bring it to management's attention like the author suggests, but it gives me a perspective on what sticking points the team and company have that I need to work through over time. reply progmetaldev 14 hours agoprevWhen I work with new hires, or I'm working in an area a teammate is unfamiliar with, I will often have them sit with me to watch and ask questions of me. I always encourage them to bring in a notebook and take notes for anything that they might have difficulty remembering, or may need more clarification on at a future time. So far, I've found that every new hire or teammate that decides not to bring a notebook and write anything down, never lasts for long. I'm happy to answer questions and help when I'm able to, but when I start getting the same questions we've already covered multiple times, and I've already told them to write it down and they don't, my confidence in their skills starts to dwindle. In contrast, the ones that use the time wisely, and take notes end up getting fast tracked to architecting systems on their own (with my oversight and code reviews). Those are the teammates that I love to work with, the ones hungry for knowledge and aren't afraid to make mistakes (assuming they aren't hiding them). I'd say I get almost as much knowledge out of mentoring as the new new hires do from learning new techniques and technology. It can be extremely rewarding. reply prakhar897 15 hours agoprevThe biggest reason i've seen is because management hasn't prioritized it. It takes a few scars before understanding the importance of these tasks, pushing for them prematurely can be really risky. Letting stuff fail might be a better path for consensus. reply MajimasEyepatch 15 hours agoparentYes, the people who set the priorities have to feel the pain in some way. If you as an employee want your boss to do something, you have to communicate it in a way that makes clear how the problem will affect what the boss cares about, not what you care about. Usually that means translating it into dollars or one of the boss's KPIs, like deployment frequency or support ticket volume. Sometimes management doesn't prioritize problems because they're short-sighted or overwhelmed. But sometimes it's because they just don't understand how big a problem it really is, and the team fails to communicate it to them effectively. For example, I've heard devs complain about how \"the tests take too long.\" On one team I was on, a couple junior devs were complaining about this, but it turned out that \"too long\" meant five minutes. Could they be more efficient? Maybe, but getting that down to one minute would take a lot of work with no impact on our ability to develop and deploy multiple times per day. Once I showed them how to run their tests locally on just the files that changed, the problem was solved. But before that, they thought the problem was \"technical debt,\" when really it was just a training issue. (Or, you know, a lack-of-ability-to-Google issue, but I'm trying to be generous.) On another team, when I heard this complaint, the team explained that the full test suite took almost an hour, and flaky tests meant that they often had to rerun the tests or merge with failing tests. Needless to say, this had a clear impact on our ability to deliver rapidly with high quality, so this was something I prioritized. Managers don't do the same work as you, so they don't feel the pain firsthand. And they're often not incentivized to care about the same things as you, at least on the same scale. As an IC, you tend to be focused on the next task at hand. The manager is thinking about their quarterly OKRs or whether the team is on track to meet their sprint commitment. If you want something to change, you have to connect the problems you have on the micro scale to the problems the manager cares about on the macro scale. And if you can't do that, or your manager won't listen, then yeah: let the problems bubble up until the manager feels the pain, as long as it won't come back to bite you. reply marginalia_nu 16 hours agoprevI live by just writing down every idea I have in a list. No particular order, I just append them on a piece of paper or a text file. Ideas rarely appear when you need them, but come throughout the day as you do other things, and at least in my case, I can never remember if I don't jot them down. Then when it's time to get something done, I just cross things off one by one. Never have to wonder what to do next, never run out of ideas, which allows some pretty spectacular bursts of productivity. reply arduanika 16 hours agoparentI'm struggling to see how this relates to TFA.

There’s always some power tripping person using “the way we do things” as a club against the newthought people reply onthecanposting 5 hours agorootparentprevThe short answer is pride and inertia. The immediate cause is lower management can't be assed to learn anything, and nobody makes them. This is in part because at big firms after 5-10 years you can politic or job-hop into management and be an email engineer who does little outside of scheduling meetings and marking up PDFs. Young engineer training is usually informal and in master-apprentice fashion. Your mentor will show you how he or she learned it 10 years ago, which is how his or her mentor learned it 10 years before that. There is little technological progress in civil engineering design that is not externally imposed, and the last big step forward was Excel and replacing hand drawings with CAD in the 90s. Digital delivery will be the next leap, but it's going to take lobbying, fanatical champions, and pure luck that Autodesk and Bentley don't use their billions to suppress it.

This is about someone entering into a new team. Walking into a team day 1, knowing nothing, and telling everyone they’re doing it wrong, is a horrible way to start things off.

I don’t trust anyone in a leadership role that starts changing things before taking the time to learn how and why things are currently done the way they are. A guy on my team now takes your approach.

From patching the game to modifying the hardware of the Xbox console to writing custom tools for performance benchmarking, my goal with this project was to push the limits of both and see how far I could go. I’ve tried to keep this blog post as short as I could and only include the most technically interesting parts but even then it ended up quite long. Prelude A long time friend who goes by the handle “doom” has spent the past few years reverse engineering and researching the hardware and software on the original Xbox. His end goal was to learn more about PC hardware and see how far he could push the console. Some of his work includes swapping out the stock Pentium 3 CPU running at 733Mhz for a variant of the Pentium 3 CPU running at 1.4Ghz using a custom made CPU interposer board, and even being able to overclock it upwards of ~2Ghz. Pentium 3 Tualatin on Doom’s custom interposer Doom also wrote custom patches for the Xbox kernel in order to on-the-fly patch timing calculations for games so they ran properly with the faster CPU. Combined with a few other hardware upgrades such as additional RAM and an SSD, doom started to refer to these as “god boxes”. These god boxes were also running a custom kernel (or BIOS image) that doom made to support all of the hardware modifications and push the hardware and software as far as they could go. One of his demos for his work was showing the opening sequence in Half-Life 2 which is notorious for abysmally slow loading times and poor performance on the Xbox, running at a solid 30 FPS and loading in a matter of seconds. But there were still additional benefits to be had. Doom wanted someone to create a proper HD resolution patch for a popular game and really utilize the hardware upgrades he performed. One night while talking over Discord doom asked if I would be interested in developing an HD patch for Halo 2 and in exchange he would provide me with a god box to develop it on. Halo 2 has a max supported video resolution of 480p and patching in support for 720p (and possibly 1080i) would get a lot of attention to demonstrate the benefits of all this work. We both knew that many of the community “HD” or “720p” game patches were not actually functioning correctly and that patching in HD resolution support for a game was more work than just searching for 640/480 in a disassembler and changing the resolution. These patches require a deep understanding of 3D graphics, DirectX APIs, and a lot of specific knowledge about the game and Xbox console. Having spent years reverse engineering the Xbox and Halo 2’s game engine I had the perfect background to take on the task. As doom would put it “there’s nobody more qualified than you to do it for halo 2 so that’s why I asked”. While it piqued my interest (and I was pretty jealous of these god boxes and all the experience he’d gotten developing them), I made a request/requirement before I would even entertain the idea. The upgraded CPU has more than double the processing power compared to the stock CPU, however, the GPU was going to take on most of the increased processing load once the video resolution was increased. After all, each additional pixel in the output image would result in more pixel shader calculations which meant more work the GPU would have to do. If he could manage to overclock the GPU I would do it, but at stock clock speeds it wasn’t worth the time it would take to develop this patch just to have it fall over on the GPU. He said he would look into it, and after a few weeks time he came back and said it was done. He managed to overclock the GPU by ~15%, and said he had the “GENESIS-3” console ready for me (a nickname for the 3rd iteration of the “god box” upgrades he’d been working on). Part 1: Rendering in HD Having spent the past few years reverse engineering and re-implementing the Halo 2 rendering engine I already had a mental list of things I’d need to change to support higher video resolutions. The first thing that needed to be changed was the size of the D3D front and back buffers. The setup for the D3D device has 3 functions that need to be modified in order to use the proper resolution for the current video mode. The first is _rasterizer_detect_video_mode which checks the video mode and sets some global variables for widescreen and progressive video modes. Next is _rasterizer_init_screen_bounds which sets up the screen dimensions used for creating the D3D device, view frustum, and a number of other things. Lastly is rasterizer_device_initialize which is responsible for setting up the D3D device. Below is a shortened version of these 3 functions with the lines of interest highlighted. All of the code shown in this post has been reverse engineered from assembly back into C for ease of understanding. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 void _rasterizer_detect_video_mode() { DWORD videoStandard = XGetVideoStandard(); DWORD videoFlags = XGetVideoFlags(); if (videoStandard == XC_VIDEO_STANDARD_PAL_I) g_refresh_rate_hz = (videoFlags & XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_PAL_60Hz) != 0 ? 60 : 50; g_letterbox_enabled = (videoFlags & XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_LETTERBOX) != 0; g_widescreen_enabled = (videoFlags & XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_WIDESCREEN) != 0; g_progressive_scan_enabled = (videoFlags & XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_HDTV_480p) != 0; ... } void _rasterizer_init_screen_bounds(int x_off, int y_off, float scale) { float width = 640.0f * scale; float height = 480.0f * scale; rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x0 = 0; rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.y0 = 0; rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x1 = (int)width; rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.y1 = (int)height; rasterizer_globals.frame_bounds.x0 = x_off; rasterizer_globals.frame_bounds.y0 = y_off; rasterizer_globals.frame_bounds.x1 = (int)width - x_off; rasterizer_globals.frame_bounds.y1 = (int)height - y_off; } bool rasterizer_device_initialize() { ...

D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_TWO : 0; break; } g_pDirect3D->CreateDevice(0, D3DDEVTYPE_HAL, NULL, D3DCREATE_HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING, &PresentParams, &g_pD3DDevice); ... } Halo 2 already supports 480p, or does it… If you’ve ever looked at the back of the game case for Halo 2 you might have seen it supports 480p. However, looking at line 42 above, the D3DPRESENTFLAG_PROGRESSIVE flag is not being set on the present parameters. And, if we look at the call site for the _rasterizer_init_screen_bounds function we see this: Call site for _rasterizer_init_screen_bounds The scale parameter is always set to 1.0f, which means the screen_bounds are always set to 640×480 regardless of what the video mode is set to on the console. On the Original Xbox 480p is considered to be 720×480, which means that Halo 2 does not render in 480p natively regardless of what the video settings are set to. If you enable 480p mode on the console you’ll get a 480p signal out but that’s because after the game is done drawing to the 640×480 back buffer it’ll get up-scaled to 720×480 by the GPU before being fed to the video encoder. I often get comments saying “that’s not not a 16:9 resolution” or “that’s not real 480p”, but “480p” encapsulates a range of resolutions and aspect ratios and 720×480 is the resolution the Xbox considers to be 480p (so take it up with Microsoft, not me…). If you’ve ever played Halo 2 in 480p mode with wide screen enabled you may have noticed that things look a little weird. That’s because when wide screen mode is enabled the game will use an anamorphic camera with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. That means it renders 1.3x the width into the same 640×480 surface as it would when wide screen mode is disabled. Here is a comparison showing the effect anamorphic scaling has on the Zanzibar wheel: Halo 2 in 480p with anamorphic scaling enabled Halo 2 in 480p with anamorphic scaling disabled I’m not entirely sure why it does this and my only guess is if you set your TV to stretch mode it would “cancel out” the horizontal “squish” introduced by the anamorphic scaling and look somewhat normal. However, I personally hate it and wanted the cleanest image I could get out of the console so I added an option to disable the anamorphic scaling entirely. Back to the back buffer… To create the D3D front/back buffers with the right dimensions we’ll need to change g_progressive_scan_enabled to be set when 720p is enabled, set the screen_bounds and frame_bounds variables based on the proper video resolution for the video mode set, and finally set some additional flags on the D3D present parameters depending on if the video mode is progressive or interlaced (1080i mode). The pseudo code for the modifications is shown below with the changed lines highlighted. I ignored the scale variable in _rasterizer_init_screen_bounds because it’s only ever set to 1.0 anyway. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 void _rasterizer_detect_video_mode() { DWORD videoStandard = XGetVideoStandard(); DWORD videoFlags = XGetVideoFlags(); if (videoStandard == XC_VIDEO_STANDARD_PAL_I) g_refresh_rate_hz = (videoFlags & XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_PAL_60Hz) != 0 ? 60 : 50; g_letterbox_enabled = (videoFlags & XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_LETTERBOX) != 0; g_widescreen_enabled = (videoFlags & XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_WIDESCREEN) != 0; g_progressive_scan_enabled = (videoFlags & (XC_VIDEO_FLAGS_HDTV_480pXC_VIDEO_FLAGS_HDTV_720p)) != 0; ... } void _rasterizer_init_screen_bounds(int x_off, int y_off, float scale) { // Set default resolution to 640x480. float width = 640.0f; float height = 480.0f; // Adjust resolution based on current video mode set.

Looking at the main menu the first thing we can see is the blue filter is now gone, and there’s some repeating line pattern strewn across the screen. Looking a bit closer and we can see part of the water geometry is also cut off, suspiciously at where the old 640 width would be compared to the new width of 720. Rendering issues in the main menu Making efficient use of D3D memory The Xbox uses a unified memory architecture meaning the CPU and GPU share the same RAM. Unlike a PC there’s no concept of creating a D3D allocation in VRAM and having the GPU manage it. On Xbox the CPU can create an allocation for textures, render targets, vertex buffers, etc, and pass the allocation address directly to the GPU. This gives developers the ability to allocate one buffer and have multiple resource “views” that utilize the memory. Consider the following code which shows how to create a render target letting D3D do all the work and how to create a render target by hand: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 // How to create a render target with D3D: IDirect3DSurface8* pRenderTarget = NULL; g_pD3DDevice->CreateRenderTarget(/* width */ 1024, /* height */ 1024, /* format */ D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8, NULL, FALSE, &pRenderTarget); // How to create a render target by hand: // Allocate and initialize the texture header. IDirect3DSurface8* pRenderTarget = (IDirect3DSurface8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DSurface8)); DWORD textureSize = XGSetTextureHeader(/* width */ 1024, /* height */ 1024, /* levels */ 0, 0, /* format */ D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8, 0, pRenderTarget, 0, 0); // Allocate memory for the pixel buffer. void* pSurfaceBuffer = D3D_AllocContiguousMemory(/* size */ textureSize, /* alignment */ D3DSURFACE_ALIGNMENT); pRenderTarget->Register(pSurfaceBuffer); While the latter looks more messy it provides greater control to the developer and is something Halo 2 makes great use of to conserve memory for all the render targets it uses. In total Halo 2 has approximately 25 different render targets it uses but there’s only 4-5 unique buffers allocated for them which saves a lot of memory. So what does this have to do with the issues we saw in the main menu? Well if Halo 2 is creating render targets by hand it’ll need to encode the width and height of the surface into the header of the render target structure. If it’s hard coded to use 640×480 resolution it would cause issues that could result in cut off images or repeating line patterns as the pitch of the surface would not match the pitch of the back buffer. Essentially, there’s two different “views” for the same memory but the views see the memory as being of different widths which results in misplaced pixels when spanning each scan line. Looking around the D3D/raster initialization code I found a function I called rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize that does exactly this. It takes the back, front, and depth buffers created by D3D and creates additional render targets and texture views from them, using hard coded dimensions of 640×480. Here is the C representation of the disassembly: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 bool rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize() { // Get the back buffer, front buffer, and depth buffer surfaces. global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(0, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]); global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(-1, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[1]); global_d3d_device->GetDepthStencilSurface(&global_d3d_surface_render_primary_z); ... global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0] = (IDirect3DTexture8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DTexture8)); global_d3d_texture_render_primary[1] = (IDirect3DTexture8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DTexture8)); // Setup texture views for back/front buffers. for (int i = 0; i Data, 0); } // Create a render target surface for the depth buffer that matches the size and format of the back buffer. global_d3d_surface_z_as_target = (IDirect3DSurface8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DSurface8)); memcpy(global_d3d_surface_z_as_target, global_d3d_surface_render_primary, sizeof(IDirect3DSurface8)); global_d3d_surface_z_as_target->Data = global_d3d_surface_render_primary_z->Data; // Create two textures for the depth buffer, one in ARGB format and one in ABGR format. global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[0] = (IDirect3DTexture8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DTexture8)); XGSetTextureHeader(640, 480, 1, 0, D3DFMT_LIN_A8R8G8B8, 0, global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[0], global_d3d_surface_render_primary_z->Data, 0); global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[1] = (IDirect3DTexture8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DTexture8)); XGSetTextureHeader(640, 480, 1, 0, D3DFMT_LIN_A8B8G8R8, 0, global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[1], global_d3d_surface_render_primary_z->Data, 0); ... } This is relatively easy to fix, we simply need to hook this function, let it run normally, and then fix up the dimensions of the textures/surfaces afterwards. The pseudo code for this hook can be seen below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 bool Hook_rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize() { // Call the trampoline and let the real function complete. bool result = rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize_trampoline(); // Update the dimensions of the surface/textures created to match the resolution of the back buffer. Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0]); Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_render_primary[1]); Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[0]); Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[1]); return result; } void Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(D3DBaseTexture* pResource) { // Calculate the correct pitch for the texture with tiling enabled. This can be different than the normal pitch // value and if set incorrectly will cause a \"striping\" effect on the back buffer. DWORD format = (pResource->Format >> 8) & 0xFF; DWORD pitch = D3D_CalcTilePitch(/* width */ rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x1, /* texture format */ format); // Set the new dimensions of the texture using the size of the back buffer. XGSetTextureHeader(/* width */ rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x1, /* height */ rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.y1, 1, 0, format, 0, pResource, pResource->Data, pitch); } There’s one additional thing to note here and it’s that the memory used for the back, front, and depth buffers is a special type of memory known as “tiled” memory. Tiled memory stores the pixel data in a way that’s more efficient to read and write to based on the design of the actual RAM chip’s memory cells. Storing the pixel data in tiled memory decreases the overall bandwidth required when reading and writing these buffers. The gotcha here is that the pitch value for the surface/texture is not always the same as it would be for a texture in normal memory (width * bpp). This is why I call D3D_CalcTilePitch in the the Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution helper function. It will calculate the correct pitch for tiled memory based on the width and bits per pixel for the texture format. If the pitch value is calculated incorrectly (ex: by doing width * bpp) you’ll end up getting a “striping” effect on the back buffer (which affects 1080i video resolutions specifically). If you’re curious what tiled memory looks like if you don’t “un-tile” it here you go: D3D back buffer of the main menu in tiled form This is the main menu image from earlier (only in 720p) dumped straight from the back buffer without un-tiling the data. If you squint hard enough you can almost make out the Halo 2 logo in the center. That aside it’s time to test the new patches and see if the modifications to the surface dimensions fixed our issues. Loading up the game with this new set of modifications gives us this: Main menu with some issues fixed Okay so the striping effect from using the incorrect pitch value in the back/front buffer surfaces is now fixed. However, the water geometry is still cutoff even after we changed the resolutions of all the render targets/textures, right? Well we only updated the primary render targets, we still need to update the intermediate render targets used by the game’s rasterizer, and this is where having game engine specific knowledge comes in handy. Resizing the rasterizer targets As I mentioned earlier there’s ~25 render targets Halo 2 uses for different passes in the render loop such as detail texture blending, water, reflections, fog, shadows, etc. The game’s rasterizer system allows for creating a render target with child render targets that utilize the same underlying memory. The 25 render targets the game creates are backed by only 4-5 unique memory allocations and uses this parent/child relationship to make efficient use of the memory. When one render target is no longer in use the others are free to use that memory. While most render targets are smaller than the back buffer (ranging from 512×512 all the way down to 64×64) there’s one in particular that needs to match the back buffer resolution which is the texture accumulator target, or taxaccum for short. The DirectX implementation on Xbox only allows for sampling from 4 textures per pixel shader pass. If you want to render something that uses more than 4 input textures you’ll need to do it in two or more passes. This is what the texaccum layer is for. Objects in the game that use more than 4 textures will first render all the detail textures to the texaccum layer. When the texaccum pass is completed the taxaccum render target will be fed into the lightmap pass as an input and combined with any additional textures for the object along with the lightmap texture to get the final output. Texaccum and lightmap shader passes Here’s an example using the ground geometry in coagulation. In the texaccum pass the detail textures for the ground geometry are blended together into the texaccum render target. Then in the lightmap pass the texaccum render target is used as an input texture along with a bump map and lightmap texture to create the final image. The reason the water geometry in the main menu is cut off is because it’s being rendered to the texaccum render target which has a hard coded size of 640×480. Now that we’re rendering in larger video resolutions the dimensions of the texaccum target will need to be increased. Looking through the rasterizer initialization code we’ll find a function I called rasterizer_targets_initialize that allocates buffers for the various render targets and initializes them: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 bool rasterizer_targets_initialize() { // Allocate and initialize the texaccum render target. if (!_rasterizer_alloc_and_create_render_target(1, 640, 480, 1, false)) return false; ... } bool _rasterizer_alloc_and_create_render_target(int target_index, int width, int height, int unk, bool z_surface) { // Calculate the allocation size rounded up to the nearest page size. int allocationSize = ((((width + 63) & ~64) * height * 4) + 4095) & ~4096; // Allocate memory from the game's self-managed memory pool. void* pPhysicalAllocPtr = physical_memory_globals.hi_stage_address[physical_memory_globals.current_stage] - allocationSize; if (pPhysicalAllocPtr > physical_memory_globals.low_stage_address[physical_memory_globals.current_stage]) { physical_memory_globals.hi_stage_address[physical_memory_globals.current_stage] = pPhysicalAllocPtr; // Mark the allocated memory as RW write-combine memory. pPhysicalAllocPtr |= PHYSICAL_MEM_ADDRESS_MASK; XPhysicalProtect(pPhysicalAllocPtr, allocationSize, PAGE_READWRITEPAGE_WRITECOMBINE); } return _rasterizer_create_render_target(target_index, /* type */ 1, width, height, z_surface, /* linear */ true, true, pPhysicalAllocPtr); } To fix the hard coded dimensions I simply hook the _rasterizer_alloc_and_create_render_target function, check the target_index parameter for the texaccum index, and change the dimensions to match the back buffer size. The pseudo code for the hook looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 bool Hook__rasterizer_alloc_and_create_render_target(int target_index, int width, int height, int unk, bool z_surface) { // Check the rasterizer target index and adjust the surface dimensions accordingly. if (target_index == 1) { // Texaccum rasterizer target: width = rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x1; height = rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.y1; } // Call the trampoline and create the render target. return _rasterizer_alloc_and_create_render_target_trampoline(target_index, width, height, unk, z_surface); } Running the game with these modifications we can see the water geometry is no longer cutoff, and loading into a map doesn’t show any noticeable rendering issues: Main menu with the texaccum layer fixed The game looks okay in 480p but the real goal of this work is to get the game playing decently in 720p, and maybe booting in 1080p, even though it won’t play well at that resolution nor will the Xbox output a 1080p video signal (but I can still take some sweet screenshots!). We still need to fix the missing blue filter on the main menu but in the interest of keeping this post as short as possible I’m going to skip the blue filter fix as it’s not very interesting anyway (spoiler: it was just a simple size check that needed updating). Changing the video settings on my console to 720p and booting the game results in… well it results in the game crashing on startup. The reason? Due to the increased size of the front/back/depth buffers and rasterizer targets we’re out of memory, or at least, out of memory that the game is able to use. Part 2: Memory Management and RAM Upgrades The original Xbox had two different console types, the retail consoles that consumers would buy with 64MB of RAM, and a development console (or dev kit/debug console) that was used by game developers with 128MB of RAM. The extra RAM on the development console helped developers debug their games and run additional test code during the development process. The motherboard used by both console types is nearly identical with the main difference being the software they run and the additional RAM chips on the dev kit motherboards (they also have a slightly different south bridge for security purposes but that’s not really important here). However, retail motherboards still had the placements for the 4 additional RAM chips and over the years people found that they could solder in the missing RAM chips and run a modified Xbox kernel to give them access to the extra memory. Retail games won’t make any use of that extra memory, but homebrew applications like Xbox Media Center will use it for things like video decoding when watching movies or streaming media. I’ve neglected to mention that up until this point the only way I was able to get the game to boot with the increased back buffer size is by running it on a console with 128MB of RAM and using an Xbox kernel with support for the additional 64MB of RAM. As-is the game will not utilize any of the additional memory, however, this kernel has additional logic to “force” certain types of memory allocations into the upper 64MB region to make space for allocations that must be in the lower 64MB region. Going into this project I already knew that the only way this game would boot in 720p would be with the RAM upgrade. In fact, the only way to get it to boot in proper 480p resolution without the RAM upgrade was to steal some memory back from the game’s in-memory texture cache which ends up causing additional texture pop-in. But all of this can be fixed by patching the game’s memory allocator to support the additional 64MB of RAM. Halo 2’s memory management It’s quite common for game developers to write their own memory management system, especially on older hardware where the built-in memory allocator may be slow or even buggy. Developers would use the built-in memory allocator to make a couple large allocations that they’d wrap in their own allocator to chunk it up and dish out as needed. At startup Halo 2 creates one large allocation that uses ~48.9MB of the available 64MB of RAM on the console, basically, every last page of memory they could possibly get once you account for the Xbox kernel and game executable. This region of memory is then chunked up for various subsystems in the game such as level metadata, texture, geometry, animation, and sound caches, rasterizer targets, network and simulation resources, etc. In order to patch Halo 2’s memory allocator I was going to need a way to visualize memory usage so I could see where things are located and how much space is being used. I spent a few nights working on a tool (GitHub: XboxImageGrabber) that would walk the page table entries for all the RAM on the console and create a crude bitmap that color codes various chunks of data, allowing me to create a visualization of what memory looks like: Memory profile of Halo 2 This might look like pixel barf and be hard to interpret but it was really only intended for my own use so I never bothered to make it pretty. The first column on the left shows the memory usage by the Xbox OS. At the very beginning is the Xbox kernel, down in the 0x83000000 region we have the Halo 2 executable and some virtual memory allocations, and at 0x84000000 is the end of the 64MB retail RAM region. This was taken on a console with 128MB of memory so everything after 0x84000000 is the “debug” memory region. The center column shows Halo 2’s memory usage for runtime data and d3d resources. This particular image doesn’t have color coding enabled so you can get an idea of how much memory the game reserves for this runtime data region. That blue blob? That’s the ~49MB allocation the game makes on startup. The column on the right shows combined memory usage, basically what has been allocated and what is free with no further classification for what the memory is used for. We can see that the stock version of the game uses almost every available page of memory it can get, sparing only a few as a safety net. Halo 2 memory profile with data classification Here’s the same memory profile image with the runtime data region color coded to show the various subsystem allocations. There’s actually a few more not pictured here but they aren’t too important. The ones we’re concerned with are going to be tag data, texture cache, geometry cache, and rasterizer buffer. The runtime data allocation appearing immediately after the Xbox kernel is not a coincidence, it’s purposefully allocated at a hard coded address of 0x80061000. The “tag data” region is actually all the metadata for every object in a map file in the form of C-structs that have been serialized using the predetermined base address of 0x80061000. The tag data system is designed to be as flexible and performant as possible, and, in my opinion the inner workings are really a feat of engineering. I could write an entire blog post about the inner workings of the tag data system and why I think it makes the Blam engine one of the most flexible engines ever made, but that isn’t relevant to this post. The key takeaway here is that this data needs to always be at the same address or else the game won’t work. But all of the other data in the runtime region can be moved around at will. Patching the memory allocator The regions we’ll want to move out of the runtime data buffer are the rasterizer targets (at least the ones we’ll be increasing in size), and the texture and geometry caches so we can increase their size to help reduce pop-in issues. We’ll also want to reduce the size of the runtime data buffer to account for the things we’re removing so we don’t waste any memory by not filling it. The patches for the memory allocator will consist of 3 main changes: Hooking certain allocation calls and moving them to the debug memory region. When these allocations are “released” (ex: when loading a new level) we’ll need to call the appropriate free function. Adjusting the size of the runtime data region to reclaim memory that’s no longer being used. I’ve called the memory allocation function we’ll need to hook physical_memory_malloc, and it’s unfortunately inlined by the compiler which means each “call site” for it will need a unique patch, and the same is true for when an allocation is free’d. The pseudo code for the memory allocator patches looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 struct physical_memory_alloc_info { const char* name; // Name for the allocation, ex: \"texture cache\" unsigned int override_size; // If non-zero use this size for the allocation void* address; // Allocation address }; // Enum used to index into Hack_PhysicalMemoryRegionInfoTable enum { PHYS_MEM_REGION_RASTERIZER_TEXACCUM_TARGET, PHYS_MEM_REGION_GEOMETRY_CACHE, PHYS_MEM_REGION_TEXTURE_CACHE, }; // Global array of tracked allocations: physical_memory_alloc_info Hack_PhysicalMemoryRegionInfoTable[] = { { \"rasterizer texaccum target\", 0, NULL }, { \"geometry cache\", 0, NULL }, { \"texture cache\", 0, NULL }, }; void* Hack_PhysicalMemoryAlloc(unsigned int regionIndex, unsigned int size, int protect) { // Get a pointer to the allocation info structure. physical_memory_alloc_info* pAllocInfo = &Hack_PhysicalMemoryRegionInfoTable[regionIndex]; // If the override size is specified use it for the allocation. if (pAllocInfo->override_size != 0) size = pAllocInfo->override_size; // Round the size up to the nearest page interval. size = (size + PAGE_SIZE-1) & ~(PAGE_SIZE-1); // TODO: Allocate memory from the debug region... pAllocInfo->address = NULL; if (pAllocInfo->address == NULL) DebugBreak(); // Debug print the allocation info. DbgPrint(\"physical_memory_malloc %s %ld at 0x%08x\", pAllocInfo->name, size, pAllocInfo->address); return pAllocInfo->address; } void Hack_PhysicalMemoryFree(unsigned int regionIndex) { // Get a pointer to the allocation info structure. physical_memory_alloc_info* pAllocInfo = &Hack_PhysicalMemoryRegionInfoTable[regionIndex]; // If the allocation is valid free it. if (pAllocInfo->address != NULL) { // TODO: Free the allocation... pAllocInfo->address = NULL; } } This allows me to hook individual call sites where the physical_memory_malloc function is inlined using a patch like so: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 push 404h ; PAGE_WRITECOMBINEPAGE_READWRITE push ecx ; size, calculated earlier in function push PHYS_MEM_REGION_GEOMETRY_CACHE ; regionIndex mov eax, Hack_PhysicalMemoryAlloc call eax ; Call our helper function to perform the allocation ; Jump over code we no longer need to execute. push 0012DA73h ret Now you’re probably wondering why the lines that perform the allocation and free calls in the pseudo code above are labeled as “TODO”, and that’s because allocating physical contiguous memory in the debug memory region is problematic… Xbox memory architecture Earlier I mentioned that the original Xbox uses a unified memory design allowing the CPU and GPU to share the same RAM. When the CPU provides a memory address to the GPU (ex: address of a texture or vertex buffer) it must use a physical memory address and the memory span must be contiguous (meaning the pages backing the allocation are all consecutive with no gaps). This is because the GPU doesn’t have any concept of page tables or virtual memory addresses so it’s unable to translate virtual addresses to perform memory accesses. It simply treats the memory address as an offset from the start of RAM and reads data as needed starting from this offset. There’s specific APIs for allocating “video” or “GPU” memory but these are all wrappers for allocating memory that is physical and contiguous. The Xbox kernel provides various functions for allocating memory but there’s two main types of memory allocations that can be made. Physical memory which is also contiguous, and virtual memory which is not explicitly contiguous (it can end up being contiguous by chance but it’s virtual memory so it’s not required to be contiguous). On an unmodified retail Xbox console there’s only 64MB of RAM and the entire 64MB region can be used to make physical or virtual allocations. When using a console with 128MB of RAM and kernel with extra RAM support only the first 64MB of RAM can be used for physical allocations, but virtual allocations can be made anywhere in the 128MB region. If you try to make a physical allocation and there’s not enough free contiguous memory in the first 64MB of RAM, the kernel will attempt to relocate virtual allocations into the upper 64MB region to satisfy the allocation request. This was done on purpose to provide a closer experience to the retail hardware for developers to work with. The additional 64MB of “debug” memory was to allow developers to run extra code and profiling tools that consumed memory without having to take away from the memory their game would normally have. There’s no benefit to allowing developers to allocate more “video” memory in the debug region as it doesn’t exist on retail hardware and can’t be used in a final version of the game. However, this limits me in terms of how much additional memory I can give Halo 2 for video allocations. Hot patching the Xbox kernel Looking at the memory profile image above we can see the “runtime data region” consumes most of the first 64MB of RAM. Not everything allocated in this region is required to be “video” memory (and thus needs to be in physical memory), so I could move as many things as possible out of that region and into the upper 64MB of RAM as a virtual allocation. But this gets quite messy to track down all of the allocations being made and patch each call site, and it won’t give us as much memory as we really need for additional performance tweaks later on. Rather than go for a sub-par solution I decided to take matters (or memory) into my own hands and try something crazy. I ran some tests where I made a video memory allocation “by hand” and just stole some unused page table entries for the upper 64MB address space. Instead of asking the kernel to allocate the memory for me, I just “commandeered” the page tables and did it myself. Feeding this address to the GPU for rendering worked just fine which meant that the limitation of only being able to allocate “video” memory in the lower 64MB of RAM is not a hardware limitation it’s a software one. The only thing preventing me from making physical memory allocations in the upper 64MB of RAM is the kernel. After spending a few nights digging through the memory management functions in the Xbox kernel I found the blocker that was preventing me from making physical allocations passed the 64MB mark: Max PFN check in MmAllocateContiguousMemoryEx The MmAllocateContiguousMemoryEx function used to allocate contiguous physical memory takes in two parameters that let the caller specify the lowest and highest acceptable addresses for the memory allocation. This is how Halo 2 gets the runtime data region to always be at the address 0x80061000, by specifying the highest acceptable address as 0x61000 (the upper most bits are masked out). The kernel takes both of these parameters and converts them into page frame numbers (basically an index for the page of memory that corresponds to that address), and checks they’re less than or equal to this constant I called MAX_USABLE_PFN. The MAX_USABLE_PFN constant corresponds to the address 0x83FE0000, which is equal to 64MB – 128KB. What is the significance of this value? The top 128kb of RAM is always reserved with 64KB used as a “scratch” region for the GPU and the other 64KB used for the CPU page tables. I believe the GPU “scratch” region is used for storing data related to depth buffer compression tags and possibly processed vertex data that is still passing through the shader pipeline, but I’ve never actually confirmed this myself. This check is our blocker for allocating physical memory in the upper 64MB of RAM. I changed this value at runtime after my test application loaded and confirmed I was able to allocate memory in the upper 64MB of RAM using MmAllocateContiguousMemoryEx, and the GPU was able to use that memory just fine. So now all I needed to do is write a function to hot patch the Xbox kernel when the game boots, no big deal right? For this patch I’ll first make sure the console has 128MB of RAM installed, then resolve the address of the MmAllocateContiguousMemoryEx function, search for the “mov edx, 0x3FDF” instruction, and patch it to use a new “MAX_USABLE_PFN” value suitable for 128MB RAM configuration. Here’s the pseudo code for the patch: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 bool PatchMaxPFN() { // Search for the max PFN value. BYTE* pPtr = (BYTE*)pMmAllocateContiguousMemoryEx; BYTE* pEndPtr = (BYTE*)pMmAllocateContiguousMemoryEx + 0x80; while (pPtr override_size != 0) size = pAllocInfo->override_size; // Round the size up to the nearest page interval. size = (size + PAGE_SIZE-1) & ~(PAGE_SIZE-1); // Allocate physical contiguous memory (using the entire 128MB address space). pAllocInfo->address = MmAllocateContiguousMemoryEx(size, /* LowestAcceptableAddress */ 0, /* HighestAcceptableAddress */ 0xFFFFFFFF, /* Alignment */ PAGE_SIZE, /* PageAccess */ protect); if (pAllocInfo->address == NULL) DebugBreak(); // Debug print the allocation info. DbgPrint(\"physical_memory_malloc %s %ld at 0x%08x\", pAllocInfo->name, size, pAllocInfo->address); return pAllocInfo->address; } void Hack_PhysicalMemoryFree(unsigned int regionIndex) { // Get a pointer to the allocation info structure. physical_memory_alloc_info* pAllocInfo = &Hack_PhysicalMemoryRegionInfoTable[regionIndex]; // If the allocation is valid free it. if (pAllocInfo->address != NULL) { // Free the allocation. MmFreeContiguousMemory(pAllocInfo->address); pAllocInfo->address = NULL; } } Visualizing the results That was a lot of work but the results are well worth it. As I mentioned earlier the only way to get the game to run in 720p or higher is with a RAM upgrade. Even running the game in proper 480p on a console without the RAM upgrade requires stealing memory back from the game to offset the additional memory requirements, which exacerbates the texture pop-in issues that are prevalent even in the game’s unmodified form. I’ve rambled on about memory management enough, here’s what the game looks like in 720p: Zanzibar beach in 720p It looks great! But it doesn’t play great… The FPS is noticeably lower to the point where it’s dipping to 10 FPS or lower in heavy scenes. While I was expecting a performance hit I wasn’t expecting it to be this bad, but that’s okay because there’s things we can do to improve this quite a bit. Before that, lets give 1080p a try and see what it looks like. Remember that while the game is rendering natively in 1080p the Xbox console is only able to output a 1080i video signal. However, by dumping the D3D back buffer directly I’m able to get a proper 1080p screenshot before the GPU converts it into half frames for the video encoder to display on screen: Zanzibar beach in 1080p Unforeseen consequences Okay so this kernel hot patching does have some undesirable side effects which is understandable since I just changed a pretty crucial aspect of how memory management works mid-execution. Hot patching the kernel and letting Halo 2 run works fine until you exit the game without cold rebooting the console. If you do a warm reboot (returning to the dashboard, ejecting the dvd tray, etc) the console is basically “hosed” and the next application/game to run will have severe graphical artifacting, and the console will most likely crash shortly after. This is likely because there’s more changes required to expand the physical memory region outside of the single change I made. I have some theories as to what the remaining issues are but having spent a significant amount of time on memory management patches I decided to take the cop out solution here. To make this more “robust” I added additional patches that would cold reboot the console (which reloads the kernel) whenever you exit the game so all of the side effects of this hot patching are hidden from the end user. This would prove useful later on as there’s additional changes I make that really should be reset after exiting the game and cold rebooting the console solves all of this. Part 3: Performance Improvements and Overclocking Now that the game is rendering in 720p and 1080p it’s time to address the performance issues and make it playable, at least in 720p. Adding 1080p support is really just a bonus to get nice screenshots and I have no expectations that the console will be able to run the game at that resolution and be “playable”, regardless of what performance improvements I can make. The first step was to get some baseline performance measurements on a stock Xbox console and the god box that doom sent me. The god box also had two different BIOS images, one that overclocked just the CPU, and one that overclocked both CPU and GPU. This would let me get three different measurements: one for stock hardware (no overclocking), one for CPU overclocking, and one for CPU + GPU overclocking. From these measurements I could determine where the performance bottlenecks were and start from there. I found a particularly heavy area on Zanzibar that I’ll refer to as the “zanzibar benchmark scene”, which was a decent test case for performance benchmarks. While collecting the performance measurements I immediately realized that the FPS between all three setups was almost identical when under heavy load which was extremely suspicious. If overclocking the CPU and GPU show no improvement in performance then the bottleneck was certainly elsewhere. My first thought was I might be maxing the memory bandwidth now that the GPU has a lot more pixel calculations to do and thus a lot more memory to read and write. However, after spending a few nights running tests and bouncing ideas off doom I realized I’d overlooked something very obvious while staring at a performance graph. Performance graph for stock console at 720p (double buffered) This graph shows GPU use (yellow), CPU use (red), frames per second (blue), and swap stall rate (teal). Initially I didn’t know what “swap stall” was and I couldn’t find any documentation about it in the Xbox SDK docs. But after I realized the game was running with vsync on it made perfect sense, swap stall = swap chain stall, the GPU was stalling because the swap chain was full and vsync was on. VSync and swap chains Halo 2 runs with vsync on and uses double buffering so it only has 2 buffers in the swap chain (one front buffer and one back buffer). The back buffer is used by the GPU to render the current frame while the front buffer is the previous frame that was rendered and is now being displayed on screen. When the GPU finishes drawing the current frame it needs to swap the back and front buffers (or rotate the swap chain) so the newly completed frame can be drawn on screen and the old one can be used by the GPU for the next frame. But when vsync is on the GPU can only rotate the swap chain at the start of a vertical blanking (vblank) period (when the TV retraces to the top and starts drawing the image from the beginning). If you turn vsync off the GPU can rotate the swap chain at any time, but if the front buffer is only partially displayed on screen when you rotate the swap chain it’ll result in a “tearing” effect on screen (hence why you want vsync on as it prevents this). The swap stall line in the graph above is the rate at which the GPU had to stall and wait for a vblank period in order to rotate the swap chain. Basically, the GPU isn’t able to render frames fast enough to keep up with the refresh rate of the screen and it ends up having to wait until the next screen refresh to rotate the swap chain. In hindsight this seems so obvious but at the time I was preoccupied with all the hardware modifications I completely forgot about vsync. From double to triple buffering This is relative easy to fix as we can just increase the number of buffers in the swap chain to 3 which allows us to queue a completed frame and immediately begin processing the next frame, even if the GPU needs to wait for the next vblank before rotating the swap chain. Here’s the updated pseudo code for the rasterizer_device_initialize hook: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 bool rasterizer_device_initialize() { ... D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS PresentParams = {0}; PresentParams.BackBufferWidth = rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x1 - rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x0; PresentParams.BackBufferHeight = rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.y1 - rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.y1; PresentParams.BackBufferFormat = D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8; PresentParams.EnableAutoDepthStencil = TRUE; PresentParams.AutoDepthStencilFormat = D3DFMT_D24S8; PresentParams.Flags = D3DPRESENTFLAG_LOCKABLE_BACKBUFFER; PresentParams.FullScreen_RefreshRateInHz = g_refresh_rate_hz; PresentParams.FullScreen_PresentationInterval = D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_IMMEDIATE; ... // Setup back buffer count and swap effect for triple buffering. PresentParams.BackBufferCount = 2; PresentParams.SwapEffect = D3DSWAPEFFECT_DISCARD; PresentParams.PresentationInterval = D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_ONE; // Check if wide screen mode is enabled. if (g_widescreen_enabled != 0) PresentParams.Flags |= D3DPRESENTFLAG_WIDESCREEN; // Check if the video mode supports progressive scan. if (g_progressive_scan_enabled != 0) PresentParams.Flags |= D3DPRESENTFLAG_PROGRESSIVE; // Check the resolution width to see if 1080i is enabled. if (rasterizer_globals.screen_bounds.x1 == 1920) { PresentParams.Flags &= ~D3DPRESENTFLAG_PROGRESSIVE; PresentParams.Flags |= D3DPRESENTFLAG_INTERLACED; } g_pDirect3D->CreateDevice(0, D3DDEVTYPE_HAL, NULL, D3DCREATE_HARDWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING, &PresentParams, &g_pD3DDevice); ... } Here I’ve increased the back buffer count to 2 (default is 1), and set the swap effect such that the swap chain will be rotated on each present call. This will give us 3 buffers to work with (2 back and 1 front), but we’ll need to make another modification to the game’s rendering engine to account for this additional buffer. Earlier when I was going through the process of resizing the game’s render targets I showed some code for how the game sets up texture views for the back and front buffers for use in rendering passes: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 bool rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize() { // Get the back buffer, front buffer, and depth buffer surfaces. global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(0, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]); global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(-1, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[1]); global_d3d_device->GetDepthStencilSurface(&global_d3d_surface_render_primary_z); ... global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0] = (IDirect3DTexture8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DTexture8)); global_d3d_texture_render_primary[1] = (IDirect3DTexture8*)malloc(sizeof(IDirect3DTexture8)); // Setup texture views for back/front buffers. for (int i = 0; i Data, 0); } ... } Each frame after the game calls Present() it’ll swap the Data field in global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]/[1] and global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0]/[1] so they point to the correct memory for the new back and front buffers. This works fine when the game is double buffered but now that we introduced a third buffer into the swap chain we’ll need to account for this after the game calls Present(). We’ll also need to update the rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize hook from earlier to initialize these buffers correctly before the first frame is drawn. Here is the pseudo code for these functions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 void Hook_IDirect3DDevice8_Swap() { // Call the trampoline and let the real function run. IDirect3DDevice8_Swap_trampoline(); // Check if triple buffering is enable. if (Hack_TripleBufferingEnabled == false) return; // Release references to the old back buffer. global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]->Release(); global_d3d_surface_render_primary[1]->Release(); // Get the new back buffer and increment the reference count twice. global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(0, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]); global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(0, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[1]); // Update the Data field for the back buffer textures. global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0]->Data = global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]->Data; global_d3d_texture_render_primary[1]->Data = global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]->Data; } bool Hook_rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize() { // Call the trampoline and let the real function complete. bool result = rasterizer_primary_targets_initialize_trampoline(); // Check if triple buffering is enabled. if (Hack_TripleBufferingEnabled != true) { // Set both primary render surfaces to point to the active back buffer. global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(0, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]); global_d3d_device->GetBackBuffer(0, D3DBACKBUFFER_TYPE_MONO, &global_d3d_surface_render_primary[1]); // Update the Data field for the back buffer textures. global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0]->Data = global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]->Data; global_d3d_texture_render_primary[1]->Data = global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]->Data; } // Update the dimensions of the surface/textures created to match the resolution of the back buffer. Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0]); Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_render_primary[1]); Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[0]); Hack_UpdateD3dPixelContainerForScreenResolution(global_d3d_texture_z_as_target[1]); return result; } With this change global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]/[1] and global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0]/[1] will always reference the current back buffer. After the Swap hook returns the game will still swap global_d3d_surface_render_primary[0]/[1] and global_d3d_texture_render_primary[0]/[1] internally but this is basically a no-op since they point to the same underlying memory. Now, you might be thinking global_d3d_surface_render_primary[1] is supposed to point to the front buffer per the game’s original implementation, so what happens now that global_d3d_surface_render_primary[1] always points to the back buffer? And the answer, is nothing. The game never used the front buffer because it can’t do anything meaningful with it while it’s being drawn to screen. It only held the pointer so it could swap the surfaces every frame. With these changes in place I loaded up the Zanzibar benchmark scene and collected some new performance measurements: Performance graph for stock console at 720p (triple buffered) As we can see the swap stall line is gone and the FPS is sitting at ~22 which is +~3 FPS higher than before. You might be thinking that a 3 FPS increase isn’t really much but when the game is capped at 30 FPS this is actually a 10% increase which is pretty nice. Also remember that the main goal here was to eliminate the swap stall which prevented the GPU from running as fast as it could. Looking at the graph some more we can see the GPU is now maxed! This might seem bad but we now know the GPU is the bottleneck. We’re still running on stock GPU clock speed and once we overclock the GPU the performance should increase quite a bit. Overclocking the GPU I spent a few nights digging through some PIX traces, running tests, and trying to find any other low hanging fruit for cheap performance gains. I was able to get another +1-2 FPS by tiling the texaccum render target but it seemed like that was all I was going to get for cheap gains. There’s one or two ideas I had that might get some performance increase but they required a decent amount of changes and I wasn’t sure if the end result would even get me a 1 FPS increase, so I decided to leave it alone and maybe loop back on it another day. With the changes to tile the texaccum render target the Zanzibar benchmark scene was sitting at 23-24 FPS which was a solid improvement over the original ~19 FPS. Now it was time to turn to overclocking, and running the Zanzibar benchmark scene on the god box with overclocked GPU gave a solid 27-28 FPS. Running around the map felt smooth and the FPS was typically holding at a steady 30 FPS, though there were still some areas (like the benchmark scene) where the FPS would drop. Overall I considered it to be highly playable and was relatively satisfied with the results. The only problem is that the god box is running a one-off bespoke BIOS image that doom made for it. While the GPU overclocking settings could be patched into other community BIOS images it wouldn’t be great if the requirement to run this HD patch was “patch your BIOS image and reflash it to your console”. Luckily I wouldn’t have to resort to that because the GPU clock generator can be controlled entirely by memory mapped IO registers. Using these registers you can control the coefficients for the clock generator and change the clock speed on the fly. So for this next patch I’m going to have the game dynamically overclock the GPU on startup. Adjusting the clock speed The clock signal for the GPU is calculated as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 NVPLL_COEFF (32 bits): Bits 0-7: M Bits 8-15: N Bits 16-18: P BASE_CLK = 16.6667 Mhz nvclk = (N * BASE_CLK / (1 << P) / M) The M and P values are set to 1 by default, and BASE_CLK is always 16.6667 Mhz which is sourced from a crystal on the motherboard. So the formula can be shortened to: (N * 16.6667) / 2. We’ll be modifying the N component which is set to 28 by default for a GPU clock speed of 233.33 Mhz. This will let us step the clock speed in increments of ~8 Mhz which I made configurable via an ini file that the patch loads on startup. The pseudo code for overclocking the GPU looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 void Util_OverclockGPU(int step) { /* NVPLL_COEFF (32 bits): Bits 0-7: M Bits 8-15: N Bits 16-18: P BASE_CLK = 16.6667 Mhz nvclk = (N * BASE_CLK / (1 << P) / M) */ // Read the current clock config from the NVPLL_COEFF register. DWORD clockConfig = *(DWORD*)(NV_GPU_BASE_ADDRESS + NVPLL_COEFF); // Mask out the old N value. clockConfig &= ~0xFF00; // Mask in the new N value. clockConfig |= ((step & 0xFF) << 8); // Write the new NVPLL_COEFF value. *(DWORD*)(NV_GPU_BASE_ADDRESS + NVPLL_COEFF) = clockConfig; } That’s it, the GPU is now overclocked. Kind of lack luster I know, but you’re probably wondering how far can we overclock the GPU? And what does the new performance graph look like? Performance graph for 300Mhz GPU OC at 720p (triple buffered) With the GPU overclocked to 300 Mhz (up from 233.33 Mhz stock) there’s a solid 3 FPS increase in performance in the Zanzibar benchmark scene compared to stock GPU clock speed. This doesn’t seem very impressive but remember this is the “benchmark” test, it was chosen because it puts a massive load on the GPU. Outside of this area there’s a noticeable increase in FPS and running around Zanzibar the game stays at 30 FPS most of the time, dipping slightly in a few heavy areas. So how far can we push the GPU? More speed better performance, right? Semiconductor fabrication is not a perfect process and every chip has imperfections in it. While every GPU that made it into an Xbox console has minimum functional and quality requirements it had to meet, the maximum capabilities of each chip varies greatly. A lot of the GPUs in the 1.0-1.4 revision consoles are on the weaker end and seem to cap out in the low 300 Mhz range, while the GPUs in the 1.6 revision consoles have been able to go upwards of 400 Mhz stable. That’s almost a 100% increase in clock speed which is very impressive, but this won’t really improve the FPS much more (or so I think). There’s another bottleneck here, and one that can’t easily be worked around. Another chip, another clock… I spent a large amount of time throughout this project wondering if part of the bottleneck issue was memory bandwidth. There’s a number of articles in the Xbox SDK docs that go into great detail about the hardware in the console, the rendering pipeline, and all the gotchas you can hit that will hurt your game’s performance. There’s a number of times that memory bandwidth is mentioned and it seems the engineers believed you could max the memory bus bandwidth fairly easily. The bus has a theoretical maximum throughput of 6.4GB/s but only about 70% of that is usable in practice, for a practical max throughput of ~4.5GB/s. I captured a number of PIX traces on the game and the estimated memory usage for a single frame was never higher than low 40MBs. No matter how I ran the numbers I just could not see the memory bus bandwidth being maxed out. In my most generous calculation I estimated max throughput of 4GB/s / 30 FPS = ~135MB/frame. Even if we assume the CPU is consuming something like 50MBs that still gives ~80MBs for GPU data. Yeah 1280×720 is a lot of pixels but this would mean each frame is accessing more data than there is RAM on the console, and it was just hard to believe. However, I know very little in this area and it was very well possible that one of these numbers was off (perhaps PIX?). The engineers certainly believed it was possible so I was most likely missing or misunderstanding something. Doom suggested I try increasing the RAM clock speed and see if FPS increases, which would indicate that memory is the likely bottleneck. The only problem is the RAM is already clocked at the practical maximum frequency of 200Mhz so you can only increase the speed by about ~10Mhz before it becomes unstable and the console crashes. After running some calculations I wrote the following snippet of code to change the memory clock speed: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 void OverclockRAM() { DWORD MPLLCoeff = 0; // Read CR_CPU_MPLL_COEFF HalReadWritePCISpace(0, 0x60, 0x6C, &MPLLCoeff, sizeof(MPLLCoeff), 0); /* CR_CPU_MPLL_COEFF Bits 0-7: M Bits 8-15: N Bits 16-19: FSB_P Bits 20-23: MEM_P BASE_CLK = 16.6667 Mhz VCOFreq = (BASE_CLK / M) * FSB_P * 2 * N MEMCLK = VCOFreq / (2 * MEM_P) */ // M/N values for 208 Mhz MEMCLK: DWORD M = 3; DWORD N = 25; // Update PLL coefficients. MPLLCoeff = (MPLLCoeff & ~0xFF)(M & 0xFF); MPLLCoeff = (MPLLCoeff & ~0xFF00)((N & 0xFF) << 8); // Update PPL value. HalReadWritePCISpace(0, 0x60, 0x6C, &MPLLCoeff, sizeof(MPLLCoeff), 1); } The M and N values above are chosen such that the resulting memory clock speed will be ~208 Mhz. I could adjust them some more and get closer to 210 Mhz but this was good enough to test. With these changes in place I booted up Halo 2, loaded up the Zanzibar benchmark scene and watched the perf monitor. I ran this test a number of times with and without the memory overclocking and the result was a solid 0.7 FPS increase when the memory overclocking was active. These test results aren’t conclusive but they’re definitely compelling. There’s different RAM chips that work on the Xbox console and have a maximum clock speed of 250 Mhz. I searched around online and placed an order for some, but at the time of writing this I haven’t gotten to installing them or running any further tests. Doom has already tried using these memory chips and said he had trouble getting them above ~230 Mhz while the GPU was overclocked, and that there’s likely another piece to the puzzle to get them running any higher. I wanted to “push the console to the limits” with this patch but I was now 3 months into development of it and needed a break. Ultimately, even if I could get these other RAM chips running close to 250 Mhz I’d more or less be the only person able to utilize it as they’re hard to come by, quite costly, and require removing any existing RAM chips from the console motherboard before installing. With the chips on order I decided to save this experiment for future me and continue on with finishing the patch. Reducing pop-in Halo 2 had some notoriously bad pop-in issues with textures and geometry and this issue has only been exacerbated on consoles that are still running the original mechanical HDDs from the early 2000s. But now that we have all this extra RAM this should be easy to solve. Earlier I talked about the game making a single large memory allocation of ~48.9MB that I referred to as the “runtime data region”. This memory region is divided up into smaller sections for various subsystems in the game such as network resources, geometry cache, texture cache, sound cache, level data, etc. Halo 2 retail memory profile The ones we’re interested in are the texture cache and geometry cache. The geometry cache is given 6.5MB of space for single player maps and 7MB for multiplayer maps. The texture cache size varies and is given all the remaining data after the “tag data” section and before the “low detail texture cache”. The larger the map the smaller the texture cache will be and the more pressure that’ll be put on it (especially for single player maps). These caches are “least recently used” data structures (or “lruv caches” as the game refers to them, not sure what the v is…), and work by evicting the least recently used data after a certain time period has elapsed. Every 30 frames (~1 second) the game will iterate through each cache and evict any data that hasn’t been used in the last 30 frames to free up space. If a request is made to load in data and there’s enough free space in the cache the data is loaded immediately (typically asynchronously, though it can block) and the request is satisfied once the read completes. If the cache is full there’s two code paths that can be taken: The caller can specify a parameter that indicates they want to force eviction on some other data. In this case the game will iterate through every entry in the cache and forcefully evict the least recently used items until there’s enough free space to satisfy the load request. If those items are currently being displayed on screen they’ll disappear in the next frame (and most likely submit new cache load requests). The caller specifies they don’t want to force eviction and the load request fails. The object will not appear on screen this frame and the game will try to load it again next frame. Almost every call site for a load request falls down code path #2 with very few locations falling down code path #1. This is the first cause of pop-in, a request to load data is made and fails resulting in the object not being displayed on screen at the proper time. When the data is successfully loaded it will “pop” on screen and typically be far enough into the players field of view that they notice it. In the case of texture loads the map file can have up to 3 different texture buffers for low, medium, and high level of detail (LOD) versions of the same image. This is not to be confused with mip maps because each texture LOD will have its own set of mip maps. When a request is made to load in a texture the game will default to using the highest LOD possible, and if the load request fails it will try again using medium and low LOD buffers in hope that they require less memory and the load request may be possible to satisfy without waiting for memory to become available. If a load for a lower LOD version of the texture succeeds the game will attempt to load the highest LOD possible in the next few frames when more memory (hopefully) becomes available. When this happens the texture will be visible immediately at lower detail and then “pop” to higher detail when it becomes available. This is typically noticeable in cut-scenes which have the highest on-demand load requirements compared to normal game play. Master chief texture popping from low to high LOD Using cache eviction to find super bounces One additional note is that each map file also contains a “low detail texture cache” which contains an “emergency” version of almost every bitmap the map uses, in sizes from 2×2 pixels to at largest 8×8 pixels, which is always resident in memory while playing. This is used in cases where a model is present in memory but the load request for the texture(s) failed at all LODs. In this scenario there would normally be no textures to render the model with but the emergency low detail texture cache can be used temporarily to get the model on screen until the normal texture can be loaded into memory. Back in the Xbox Live days of Halo 2 there used to be a “glitch” where if you pulled up the Xbox Live friends menu and then closed it the level geometry would be rendered with extremely low detail textures. If you looked closely enough you could see “cracks” in the geometry (really, just where non-co-planar triangles were joined together) that you could try and use for super bounces. This technique was used to find suitable places for performing super bounces and I even remember finding a few myself using this method. It turns out this isn’t actually a “glitch” but the game using the emergency low detail texture cache because the normal textures for geometry were evicted and the geometry needs to be rendered this frame. Foundation with low detail textures Visualizing cache usage When I first started adjusting the geometry and texture cache sizes I could definitely see pop-in was being reduced but I didn’t really have any good indication of when the caches were large enough and further tweaks were just redundant. After scraping through every Halo 2 build I had along with the Vista and MCC versions on PC, I was able to find enough info to recreate a debugging feature that Bungie had implemented in their debug builds of the game (this was such a pita). Using this graph visualization I could see exactly how much of the cache memory was being used at any given time which let me fine tune the sizes to what I felt was a pretty good result. Halo 2 Outskirts stock texture cache On the stock version of the game the campaign map Outskirts (old mombasa) has a texture cache size of ~19MB. I chose this map as my test map because the opening cinematic had pretty noticeable pop-in and with the original HDD in the console it could be comically bad at times. The image above shows the texture cache graph visualization. The graph is broken up into pairs of 2 lines. The first line indicates how the memory is being used: gray = free, red = in use high detail, purple = in use medium or lower detail (aka memory pressure), pink = stolen. The second line indicates when the memory was last used: green = in use this frame, blue = in use the last 30 frames. As a side note the game can steal memory from the texture cache for other purposes such as for rasterizer render targets that are only used in cinematic cutscenes, playing the intro/attraction/credits videos, etc. As we can see in the image above master chief is being rendered using the low detail texture cache because the normal texture cache is full and there’s no memory to satisfy the texture load request. Every single texture in the cache is either in use this frame or some time in the last 30 frames. So until enough textures age out and get evicted, master chief will be stuck in low detail. Halo 2 Outskirts stock texture cache This scene with the sniper team is one of the heavier scenes in the opening cutscene and would often result in model and texture pop-in. We can see from the texture cache graph that almost all of the memory is in use and there’s quite a few textures that are being loaded at medium or lower detail (in purple) due to the memory pressure. I also implemented an almost identical graph view for the geometry cache and using both of these I began to fine tune the cache sizes until the pop-in issues were more or less gone. Increasing the cache sizes The final result is the geometry cache being increased from 6.5/7MB to 20MB, and the texture cache increased to a static size of 30MB, nearly doubling both caches in size from the stock version of the game. At these sizes I felt the caches had adequate space and texture and model pop-in was more or less resolved. Halo 2 Outskirts upgraded texture cache As we can see the scene where master chief would appear with low detail textures now appears with high detail textures immediately (no more pop-in!) and there’s even plenty of free space in the texture cache. For the sniper scene we can see that in the previous frames all of the cache memory was being utilized, but not all at the same time as there’s plenty of chunks where the texture data has aged out of the cache. However, there were still a few cases where things would pop-in even though there was free space in the caches. To further fix this I ended up adding support to increase the HDD transfer speed from the stock UDMA 2 speed (~33.3MB/s) to UDMA 3 (~44.4MB/s) or UDMA 5 (~100MB/s) if your console had an 80 pin IDE cable. This provided a 10% increase in transfer speeds for consoles running the stock IDE cable and up to a 300% increase (theoretically, the actual transfer speeds depend greatly on the size of data being transferred) for consoles with an upgraded IDE cable. This not only helped with the remaining pop-in issues but greatly reduced loading times for the game as well. At this point I was pretty satisfied with the result. The final memory profile So after all these changes what does the final memory profile look like for Halo 2 in 720p on a console with 128MB of RAM? Halo 2 720p memory profile The geometry and texture caches are now huge, and more than 75% of the available 128MB of RAM has been utilized. For 1080p mode I actually had to dial the geometry and texture cache sizes back a bit as the memory used by the swap chain and rasterizer targets was so large there wasn’t enough memory remaining for the increased caches, and more or less all 128MB of RAM was in use. Conclusion I wanna thank everyone that took the time to read all the way through this blog post. This is the longest post I’ve written to date and I tried to keep it as short as possible and even cut a bunch of smaller, less interesting things out. I also wanna give a huge thanks to Doom for encouraging me to do this work, providing hardware for testing, and insight into some deep technical areas. This project was a ton of fun to work on and I learned a lot throughout the process. I always wanted to work at Bungie on a game like Halo but never got the chance to do so, and working on this project in some ways felt like I actually got to work on the game. There’s still room for improvement with a lot of the performance and memory changes I made. But overall I feel this HD patch has pushed Halo 2 and the Xbox console to their limits and I’m satisfied with the results without trying to go any further. You can find the download and source code for the Halo 2 HD patch here: GitHub I also made a video showing side-by-side comparisons of the stock game vs the HD patch, and performance metrics for each video resolution: YouTube video showing a comparison between stock game and HD patch Tags: 720p, Halo 2, original xbox, xbox, xbox hd patch 3 Responses Nicholas / 4-17-2024 / · Not sure why you kept talking like the lack of 1080p output killed any benefit to rendering at 1080p… it just means you can take advantage of awesome Super Sample Anti Aliasing instead for a significantly better looking 720p image than if the game natively rendered at 720p! SSAA of course incurs the exact same performance impact as rendering at 1080p with 1080p output (if such output were to exist) but to talk like there’s no benefit without also having 1080p output is just weird. Ryan Miceli / 4-17-2024 / · It’s not so much the lack of 1080p output as it is the performance being too poor. I actually considered trying an experiment to remove/bypass the video encoder on the Xbox motherboard and replace it with the one that’s used on the XboxHD+ modchip (which supports 1080p). Even if I could get it to work at normal resolutions I wasn’t sure if it’d be possible to get the GPU to “talk” to it at the speeds required for 1080p, or if the pixel bus could handle that much throughput. But once I saw the game ran as bad as it did at 1080p I basically gave up on the idea entirely. SSAA could be enabled but there’s some caveats that would only make it worthwhile at 2x and the 2x filters aren’t great imo (4x is where it starts to shine but would have worse FPS than normal 720p). Once I ran into the memory throughput bottlenecks I basically abandoned the idea of trying to enable SSAA.

Take it up with some ITU dudes in the 1970s actually: https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_304-rec601_wood.pdf “The February 1980 note further suggested that the number of samples per active line period should be greater than 715.5 to accommodate all of the European standards active line periods. While the number of pixels per active line equal to 720 samples per line was not suggested until the next note, (720 is the number found in Rec. 601 and SMPTE 125), 720 is the first value that “works”. 716 is the first number greater than 715.5 that is divisible by 4 (716 = 4 x 179), but does not lend itself to standards conversion between 525-line component and composite colour systems or provide sufficiently small pixel groupings to facilitate special effects. Arguments in support of 720 were provided in additional notes prior to IBC in September 1980. […] As noted above, Rec. 601 provided 720 samples per active line for the luminance channel and 360 samples for each of the colour-difference signals. When the ITU defined HDTV, they stipulated: ‘the horizontal resolution for HDTV as being twice that of conventional television systems’ described in Rec. 601 and a picture aspect ratio of 16:9. A 16:9 picture ratio requires one-third more pixels than a 4:3 picture ratio. Starting with 720, doubling the resolution to 1440 and adjusting the count for a 16:9 aspect ratio leads to the 1920 sample per active line defined as the basis for HDTV [9]. Accommodating the Hollywood and computer communities’ request for ‘square-pixels’, meant that the number of lines should be 1920 x (9/16) = 1080. Progressive scan systems at 1280 pixels per line and 720 lines per frame are also a member of the ‘720-pixel’ family. 720 pixels x 4/3 (resolution improvement) x 4/3 (16:9 aspect ratio adjustment) = 1280. Accommodating the Hollywood and computer communities’ request for ‘square-pixels’, meant that the number of lines should be 1280 x (9/16) = 720. Therefore, most digital television systems, including digital video tape systems and DVD recordings are derived from the 4:2:2 basic standard format. The 720 pixel-per-active-line structure became the basis of a family of structures (the 720-pixel family) that was adopted for MPEG-based systems including both conventional television and HDTV systems.” reply bestham 7 hours agoparentI thought DVD only supported 4:3 anamorphic video with non square pixels for the correct playback aspect ratio. reply Lammy 5 hours agorootparentIt's true that 4:3 is also anamorphic on DVD since the 720×480 MPEG transport is a 3:2 resolution. I think it's a pretty elegant compromise halfway between 4:3 and 16:9 so both can look equally decent. A lot of DVD video has a program area of 704×480, and most DVD rippers don't differentiate so you wind up with 8px pillarbars and very slightly wrong dimensions: https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/269644-DV-to-704x480-or-... DVD-sourced media can look great on modern displays if you… – Encode at 720×540 slash 960×540 to avoid throwing away that extra horizontal detail, as most encoders do by crunching 4:3 video down to 640 (with pillarbars lol) × 480. Also to take advantage of integer-scaling to 1080/2160/etc which is especially beneficial on cheap TVs with crappy scalers. — Deinterlace to double-FPS (60000/1001 fields-per-second for color NTSC) to avoid throwing away the actual benefit of interlacing in that sweet sweet motion detail. Most rippers crunch it down to 30FPS like Handbrake leads people to do. — Convert the video to HD-standard color primitives, again to avoid cheap displays' poor treatment of SD colorspace.

One of the reasons I'm a software engineer today is because I could easily examine webpages to see how they work, tinker with the memory of programs, open up hardware to see what's inside (relatively low risk of destroying the device), and so forth. And yeah, back in the day of Halo PC, modding the levels taught me a lot about what goes into the game. Knowing what a \"BSP\" is can be a pretty useless piece of trivia, but it made me feel smart and capable of understanding more. It's still possible to get into tech and learn things today, but I have a hard time seeing how this can be accomplished by genuine tinkering. Software is way harder to crack/debug today; certainly not impossible, but the barrier of entry is much higher. Plus there's a ton of moving parts that go into getting software to work securely on not just mobile but modern desktops, adding another layer of hassle. You can still examine what a webpage is doing, but even that has changed significantly; so many websites today are div soup (yes, worse than in the early 2000s) to support JavaScript monstrocities that are also minified and obfuscated. When it comes to games, you can almost forget it in some cases because they're so heavily dependent on content streaming from servers. As far as hardware goes, you've either got to face various security hoops that can brick devices, use a heat gun to unglue the bezels on certain things, and face a lot more risk in permanent damage. All of these changes were made for a reason, but we've also taken the fun out of everything. Even game modding really wasn't what it used to be in spite of some of the tools available today technically being better than those in the past. reply somenameforme 18 hours agorootparentI agree with you in general, but I think it has to be said that we also live in the era of things like the source for Unreal Engine 5 being completely and wholly available, along with a zillion tutorials and extremely well documented source. This is unlike anything we had, and better in basically every single way imaginable. In the hardware world there's Pi's, dirt cheap PCBs that you can have delivered inBut maybe there was something about how counter-culture and esoteric stuff was itself attractive precisely because of that. There's definitely that element, but I also think something missed by compartmentalizing hardware \"tinkering\" to devices designed specifically for the task. Nothing about a Raspberry Pi, for instance, is mysterious. If a person is going to buy one, they already have a significant level of interest and base knowledge. A kid's not gonna have one lying around and get curious about it unless their parent is a geek who owns those things, and even then said kid may have no good reason to even bother with one. Practically nobody today is opening up their laptop or their phone to mod it or even just see what's inside. I'm not saying the modern situation is bad, but a significant amount of it is artificial in a way that wasn't when the devices one would play with were the devices actually being used, and it's not clear to me whether what we have now is actually better in regard to inspiring future generations. Engaging with one's everyday hardware is an exercise in the power process that fewer and fewer generations are experiencing. reply thomastjeffery 17 hours agorootparentprevThe big difference is that people used to mod existing games. That allowed modders to leverage the game's engine, gameplay design, art, and even its existing playerbase. Having a full-featured open-source game engine is great, but starting with that means starting at square one. By obsessively enforcing copyright and \"anti-cheat\", we effectively bury the game-making process 6 feet underground. Every game is declared dead at the very moment of its release. Every decision its creators made up to then is set in stone. The game studio itself must exist in isolation, ignorant of the very world it is creating its games for. It's no wonder that AAA studios are so out of touch with the people who play their games. Gamers are explicitly excluded from the creative process. reply BlueTemplar 10 hours agorootparentThat's their loss.

A lot of that is being done and is driven by \"the kids\". It's an appealing, easy, and low-risk entry point for newer developers who want to dive into low level stuff, and it even has a bit of a \"fuck the man\" bent to it, which is fantastic. You're right that the environment is different from what we grew up with, it was always going to be. But I think the kids will find their own way.

Halo was a Bungie product, and when Bungie left as Microsoft took it over yeah, the product had loftier business goals that needed to be protected. Smaller devs can't really reach critical market saturation anymore like they used to. You can criticize where things has gone with MTX but I don't think that was a choice by the game developers. I also think it's a generational thing as you and I are now too old to spend all day fucking around with some game we played a ton. I'm sure the kids of today are tinkering with minecraft/fortnite/whatever replaced those games. Also to me it's a bit of wanting to try and put the tooth paste back in the tube. When we were teenagers modding Halo we maybe didn't fully understand the impacts it had on the game's community and the overall experience. As an adult I just see how games like Call of Duty appear to be constantly losing the fight against hackers, and using over engineered matchmaking algos with SSBM to try and maximize the typical user's gameplay experience. But I can't regain my naivety and be one of the many younger adults who probably don't even really notice these issues, the way I didn't when I played Halo 3 on Xbox Live which had boosting, standby, and stealth servers. reply SmellTheGlove 7 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you, but would suggest that the thing to focus on is the next layer of abstraction.

Yeah there’s a higher barrier to entry, but look at that guy the other day that posted about improving performance by dynamically pruning a model. Or half the crazy shit on huggingface.

I agree and have the same feeling we've lost something as so much computer-centric tech has become relatively inaccessible in the name of 'security' (although much seems like efforts 'secure' business models or IP). As you observed, the tech has also evolved in ways which make it relatively undiscoverable through casual tinkering. Although perhaps we suffer from a generational perspective bias, I think there really was a 'golden era' of computer tech hobbyist accessibility and discoverability. When Did the 'Golden Era' Begin? I'd peg it as starting around the late Usenet era. Interestingly, there was definitely a time period in consumer computer tech when it was too early. I know because I started \"too early\" and missed being a teenager in the golden era because I got my first computer as a teenager in 1981. It was a Radio Shack Color Computer with 4K of memory, a 0.9 Mhz 8-bit 6809 processor and storage via an external cassette tape player. Fortunately, the ROM BASIC on that model was perhaps the most evolved 8-bit ROM BASIC Microsoft ever made (vs the early Commodore & Atari flavors) and Radio Shack did a fantastic job on the large, well-illustrated color manuals. Unfortunately, 1981 was too early because no one in my family's extended social network had ever touched a computer. So, beyond the BASIC manual in the box, I was on my own with my new computer. While there were a few big magazines like BYTE on news stands, very little in them applied to my computer. I eventually discovered a couple of zine-style publications at a distant big news stand. Although they were essentially overgrown stapled newsletters printed in B&W, they became my lifeline because they had articles written by hobbyists more advanced than I, as well as mail-order ads for cassette tape-based software. This was the key that unlocked the mysterious realm of assembly language for me when I ordered a $12 homebrew monitor program written by some random guy who took out a classified ad. The local library didn't have any books relevant to my new microcomputer, local colleges only offered computer courses under the math dept and those were focused on mainframes and COBOL (I think back then 'real' CompSci was limited to Ivy League and top tier tech unis). Even large bookstores had nothing useful to me I could order other than Osborne's 6809 CPU book which was really an architecture and instruction set reference manual mostly incomprehensible to an isolated teenage hobbyist starting out. A few years later 300 baud modems became cheap enough for hobbyists to acquire but it took another year or so for BBSes to emerge which were targeted at my computer (most BBSes prior to that were run on CP/M hardware and focused on one platform (not mine)). So dialing BBSes focused on my platform involved long-distance charges which meant short calls. Another year later FidoNet connected larger BBSes and national-level info began to circulate and my local hobby scene stayed pretty much like this for a few years. New info centered around zines, local computer club meetings, mailed tapes & diskettes and short BBS calls. Info was available but it was scarce and you had to work at getting it. That's why I think the true golden era truly took off in the late Usenet period. That's when anyone could subscribe to a ~$10/mo service providing 1200 baud access to Usenet feeds in their local area code. Before that, unless you were at a university studying CompSci or worked at a uni or large tech company, Usenet was a magical land you only heard about on BBSes or at user group meetings. When random home hobbyists got direct access to the firehose of high-quality, global Nerdverse content that was the Usenet CompSci feeds it felt like the Enlightenment dawning. From there the transition to the early web was pretty natural since a lot of early tech-centric websites were much like a BBS ring. We didn't need search because they mostly linked to each other and people were running them as a hobby so few had ads other than maybe a sponsorship from an ISP or modem company (usually just paid in free service or hardware). Fortunately, the tech hobbyist web wasn't impacted much by the 2001 dot com crash since it was never about revenue. Up until the slow decline gradually started in the mid-2000s, it was pretty great - flashing BLINK tags and all. Honestly, we didn't even realize how good we had it, or imagine that it might someday end. When Did the 'Golden Era' End? Having lived through the pre-Golden Era, the early days and through the end, I think the seeds of the Golden Era's slow decline were planted when the modern web business began to emerge from the ashes of the dot com crash. Although things were still pretty hobbyist-discoverable in desktop OSes and the web through 2010-ish, troubling signs were on the horizon. For those paying attention, the rapid dominance of iOS in the late 2000s was ominous. Apple's business model required a walled garden app store and their concept of users was not as active explorers but as purely passive eyeballs for media and app-snacking. Even though a few app developers did well in the early app store, the fundamental model relegated them to the role of sharecroppers working Apple's farm with Apple's tools and selling only to Apple's store (with no access to their app's end-users). In all, entry-level, home-based tech hobbyists got almost 20 really amazing years in the 'Golden Era' from roughly the late 80s to the late 2000s. It would be wonderful if in the distant future that period is known as \"The First Golden Era\" but right now it's hard to be optimistic. While there is still an enormous amount of hobbyist info available online and more emerging, it's in a context of equally increasing locked down areas and ever decreasing discoverability (though open source and Github-like sites are notable exceptions). Maybe this is why retro computing and retro gaming are booming now with new people who never experienced it the first time. It's a place where that unique Golden Era ethos, vibe and community still exists. Last year I went to a local user group meeting for Amiga computers, which is what I had mid-80s to early 90s. I met a bunch of enthusiastic Amiga users who hadn't been born when I bought my first Amiga. It was strange to feel both \"old\" and \"OG Cool\" at the same moment but also heartening to feel that same open community vibe still beating. :-) reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentprevThey’ve got, with wildly varying levels of skill and investment: unity, unreal, godot, or Roblox.

Competitive online FPSs with strong modding communities were already more than a decade in full swing on the PC. reply hombre_fatal 17 hours agorootparentSome things Halo 2 had off the top of my head that aren't related to gameplay: - Matchmaking. Almost all games at the time made you manually join lobbies, and now we take matchmaking for granted. - Persistent party. You'd invite your friends to your party and then start the match-making process. During the whole process you could chat with your friends, and when the game ended, you were still a party and could talk to each other. - Chat. Everyone had an Xbox Live headset which came with the service. So everyone was a participant of party chat, in-game team chat, and even \"proximity chat\" with the enemy. With Halo 2's chat systems + Xbox Live headset ubiquity, it was a highly social game. - Split screen online. All of the above worked with playing with a friend in split screen. Your friend could come over and you could start Team Slayer matchmaking in split screen which was awesome—the game would have to find two more teammates—, and your guest could even chat. Something that could never be done on PC really. These dominated the old \"look for and join the server\" model of past FPS and, frankly, I could never go back to that. Gameplay wise, Halo 1 had most of the innovations that Halo 2 capitalized on but Halo 2 moved to the pure shield-is-your-health-bar system and removed health packs. After each battle you didn't have this scramble for a health pack just to get ready for the next confrontation, so the pacing was better than arena shooters imo. Finally, Halo 2 didn't need to be the global first on each bullet point to be innovative. But it was probably the first game to have all these in one package. There was a lot of UX polish in setting this standard which you can tell because most games don't reach it even today. reply amatecha 16 hours agorootparentDon't forget the post-game carnage report, which, while first present in Marathon, was refined and provided the best post-multiplayer-game stats of any game I've seen, even years later. reply CYR1X 15 hours agorootparentThe telemetry bungie used to popular stats on their website is better than pretty much any modern game today outside of like CS2.

Gorgeous shader-based graphics for the time, vehicles, absurd arsenals, wide-open maps, and 16 player(!!!) LAN play. It's a game that would have sold like gangbusters on PC, and was only that much more successful for being well-supported on console too. One might even argue that the success of Halo is what forced arena shooters like Counter Strike and Team Fortress to evolve or die.

Game consoles were (and still are to a some degree), by and large, toys. Toys that parents buy for their children with the expectation that they can be mostly left to their own devices with them. The ESRB/PEGI/etc. ratings system was put in place so that parents would be able to trust that they know what's in the toy without having to sit over the kids' shoulders every single minute they are playing. In a sense it's not unlike Mattel spending a lot of energy making sure their dolls and action figures don't pose any choking hazards. Allowing modding breaks that system, and by extension the accompanying trust. This is a big deal for a toy manufacturer. It's also why Hot Coffee was such a mess despite the content not being normally accessible. Parents don't want to have to care about technicalities. People like to think of this situation as a \"think of the children\"-type of hand-wringing, but it's actually more of a \"think of the parents\", who happen to be the ones with money. Again, not discounting the greed and DRM aspects of this, and it definitely sucks pretty hard for adult users of the systems, but it's far from all there is to it. reply bri3d 18 hours agorootparentI've never heard of a parent being concerned about console mods, of all things, and I (as a parent) don't really buy this angle. The original Xbox's weak parental controls could be bypassed by pressing X Y Left Trigger X, a tidbit that was quickly distributed throughout my middle school to let everyone launch M-rated Halo discs. Presumably if publishers were actually pressuring Microsoft to make a child-safe device, they'd have come up with a more advanced protection mechanism than that. Modifiability/vulnerability would not affect my game console buying decision as a parent at all, provided the console had some form of cursory parental controls. I'd probably choose a console that didn't have such a simple bypass as the original Xbox, placed head to head with another console, but if my kid has to go online (!), learn about exploit development, and run some advanced tool to bypass parental controls, that's a valuable learning experience, and they were already on the Internet somehow, a much more dangerous place than an M-rated game anyway. DRM and cheating are the drivers for game console secure boot. Cheating is getting even more important than DRM, really, IMO - it's one of the places where consoles have a huge edge over PC gaming. reply bordercases 18 hours agorootparent> Presumably if publishers were actually pressuring Microsoft to make a child-safe device, they'd have come up with a more advanced protection mechanism than that.

And this: >This provided a 10% increase in transfer speeds for consoles running the stock IDE cable and up to a 300% increase (theoretically, the actual transfer speeds depend greatly on the size of data being transferred) for consoles with an upgraded IDE cable. And this (again from the GitHub repo): >If your console has 128MB of RAM this patch will utilize the extra RAM available which will enable use of 720p and 1080i video modes as well as increase the size of in-memory caches for textures and geometry. The size increase for the texture and geometry caches will significantly reduce pop-in issues to the point of being almost non-existent. For just 480p you can overclock the GPU on a stock console and use a different IDE cable. I think the remark about the SSD was unintentionally misleading -- perhaps he did mean the combo of 80pin + SSD though. It does not require an overclocked CPU (he states that the CPU was not the bottleneck), and the increased RAM is only required if you want resolutions of 720p or higher.

Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult.

On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.

I picked up a Classical Mechanics book to get back into the swing of things and of course it went through some basic linear algebra. It’s been a while since I’ve thought about the dot product of two vectors. You know what blew me away though? Not one textbook I looked in mentioned “why” the dot product is important; that is it’s useful for determining the similarity of two vectors. They all focused on the mechanical details of computing the dot product, but never spelled out the reason it can be useful. I went through a few other resources before I broke down and had a little chat with ChatGPT to discuss the meaning behind it and it makes perfect sense after that. In comparison to when I was in college, things are much slower paced so I can take the time I need to ensure I have a full grasp of a concept before moving forward. I guess all of this is to say that as I’ve continued forward through more concepts I keep finding that the books I’m reading offer a mechanical view instead of a holistic view of the material. This feels like the biggest issue with most math books I’ve read and it makes me wonder where books that offer more semantic meaning of concepts instead of recipes exist. reply liammclennan 3 hours agoparentIt's not just the books it is the whole method of teaching. I remember learning the steps to calculate an eigenvector without a single comment on why one would ever want to do that. I think it is done so that the educator can claim \"this course teaches all of calculus and linear algebra and quantum mechanics\". To actually explain things properly would require more modest course goals. reply ozim 1 hour agorootparentI still would argue that method of teaching is perfectly fine. You cannot simply explain to someone complex stuff - best way is to let people grind through to build their own understanding. Parent poster wrote that \"it’s useful for determining the similarity of two vectors\" - now I would ask why do I need to determine similarity of two vectors as it does not mean much to me - if I would be grinding through math problems I would most likely find out why, but there is no way I could understand and retain it when someone would just tell me. reply z3phyr 1 hour agorootparent> Ask why do I need to determine similarity of two vectors Simple: Start with a) Suppose you are making a video game.. b) Suppose you are determining ballistic trajectory of your missile system based on model rockets c) Suppose you are running a fighter robot group.. Or any of the stuff children are supposed to *actually* do and then take these classes with determination to do the actual creative things that they wanna do all life. There is an aspect of jest in the above comment, but it also contains some likely truth. Children love doing stuff, and these are the things that may enable them. reply jampekka 1 hour agorootparentprevI think more intuitive/holistic ways of teaching would be a lot better. But it's hard to do, especially in dead tree format. To get someone understand something holistically, as in link to their previous knowledge base, requires knowledge of what their knowledge base is. Traditionally this has been done with structuring the teaching with prerequisites etc and hoping it works. I struggle with this quite a bit when I teach students with heterogeneous background. To be effective, one has to first probe what the students already knows to be able to relate the new stuff to that, and this requires interaction. Hypertext is/would be helpful for self-learning, but it's sadly very underutilized. LLMs may be better. But probably even those can't at least in the current form replace interactive human teaching as they don't really form/retain a model of what the user knows. reply vasco 1 hour agorootparentprev> You cannot simply explain to someone complex stuff This is absolutely not true. Many times I've experienced the moment of something complex \"clicking\" after hearing or reading an appropriate explanation for a phenomenon - finally seeing the right visual or appropriate example or comparison. I find it hard to believe you've never experienced this other than through grinding problem sets. reply ozim 40 minutes agorootparentI don't believe something can \"click\" - without grinding first. I believe something \"clicked\" only because you were grinding or already quite familiar with the topic. There is no way to simply explain complex topic so someone would just get it or someone would \"click\" on after reading one book on the topic. reply vasco 3 hours agorootparentprevI think I only learned linear algebra about 3 or 4 years after I graduated.

I personally find that education is a process of emanations: first one digests the jargon and the mechanical activity of some subject (taking a dot product, in this case) and then one revisits the concepts with the distracting unfamiliarity of the technical accoutrements diminished by previous exposure. Thus able to digest the concepts better, the student can revisit the technical material again with a deeper appreciation of what is happening. The process repeats ad-infinitum until you ask yourself \"what even IS quantum field theory?\" reply Nevermark 1 hour agoparentprevIn high school trigonometry I am sure I was clear that sine and cosine formed the circle. How could I not? But that fact’s significance and too obvious simplicity, with all its ramifications, only hit me deeply and profoundly when a year later I realized I could use those functions to draw a circle on a screen. Before that they were abstractions related to other abstractions that I had to memorize to pass a course. To this day I am frustrated when reading papers about abstract algebraic relations and other such concepts, without even a sentence or two discussing any intuitive way to think about them. Just their symbolic relations. I appreciate that in the game of math that view becomes natural. But most of us learn math with additional motivations and are interested in any perspective that highlights potential usefulness or connection to the real world. Many of us mentally organize our knowledge teleologically. Yet even when usefulness is known to exist, it is often neither mentioned or referenced. Or even considered relevant. Edit: the same goes for not showing a single concrete example of an abstract concept. A kind of communication that would unlock many mathematical papers to a much larger audience of intelligent and relevant readers. reply diffeomorphism 33 minutes agoparentprev> Not one textbook I looked in mentioned “why” the dot product is important; that is it’s useful for determining the similarity of two vectors. Most textbooks motivate it by the angle between the vectors or as projections (e.g., for hyperplanes). Numerics-focused ones will further emphasize how great it it is that you can compute this information so efficiently, parallelizable etc.. Later on it will be about Hilbert space theory or Riemannian geometry and how having a scalar product available gives you lots of structure. > This feels like the biggest issue with most math books I’ve read and it makes me wonder where books that offer more semantic meaning of concepts instead of recipes exist.

I think they (both the projection interpretation and relation to angle between vectors) were taught in high school at the latest. There's also a lot of interpretations and uses for the dot product, some of which aren't necessarily that useful for classical mechanics. But in general, literature using and/or teaching mathematics does tend to be too algebraic/mechanistic. Languge models can be a very good aide here! reply threatofrain 2 hours agoparentprevColleges often have multiple classes on the same math subject, one made for physics and ME/EE people, one made for psych people, and one for CS. Some people don't realize that they accidentally picked up a textbook meant for a specific college pathway they don't care about. Understandably college courses & textbooks meant for CS people will be more focused on computation, while a math major who is taking Linear Algebra will get a more theoretically motivated course.

Thanks :) reply jampekka 45 minutes agoparentI think the notation and conceptualization is needlessly confusing. Some of it relates to old, often philosophical and even theological, debates on ontological status of infinitesimals. The difference quantinent ended up as the Official Blessed Formulation of differential calculus, but it's very rarely used in practice, even though that's how calculus is used. And in practice calculus is still done using ad-hoc infinitesimal notations, but they are some weird thing with rules of their own which very few actually know (at least I don't). Nonstandard calculus allows using infinitesimals in algebra with more or less the usual rules. Not sure if it's not more popular due to some fundamental technical or philosophical problems, or if it's just conservatism. Stochastic calculus is quite bizarre indeed. Never understood e.g. the \"proper\" formulation of continuous time Kalman filters. Just limiting the timestep to zero seems to make sense and produces the right result with some massaging, but I've understood it's not really formally correct. reply smatija 1 hour agoparentprevThe problem isn't that resources like this didn't exist in the past (Calculus Made Easy was written in 1910 after all), problem is that they aren't wellknown - and that is unlikely to change even today. reply melenaboija 1 hour agorootparentMy opinion is that the problem (difference) is that digital format and internet is not the same as paper and libraries. reply smatija 57 minutes agorootparentI would argue that internet makes good resources even harder to find - there is so much of everything, with no curation, that any resource's chance of gaining long term recognition is practically zilch. reply spinlock_ 21 minutes agoprevThe last couple of months, I have been studying the fundamentals of algebra using Professor Leonard's YT Channel[0].

The hard part isn't the highest level concepts, which are actually fairly easy to grasp and somewhat intuitive. The hard part is all the foundational knowledge required to solve actual math problems with Calculus. The most difficult parts of Calculus (for me at least) are: 1. Having a very thorough grasp of the groundwork / assumed knowledge. Good enough that you can correctly solve an unexpected problem, from completing the square to long division of polynomials to an equation involving differentials. 2. Understanding and correctly applying the notation and graphing techniques, from Leibniz notation to sketching curves. This is why large books and courses exist covering only introductory Calculus, not even beginning to scrape the surface of more advanced math. reply svat 3 hours agoparent> these kind of \"calculus made easy\" pamphlets The link is not a pamphlet (unless you read only the linked HTML page).

It comes down to Leibnitz Vs Newton, and the world has standardised on the notation of one (I forget which). However the notation is a destination when learning it all, and the foundational ideas behind calculus were best explained taking ideas from both of them. That's what this book does. It takes you through with every simple jumps in logic allowing you to discover calculus yourself and you therefore have the foundations to reason about it yourself.

Yes if your algebra is weak you will not be able to cope with solving calc equations. The solution to that problem is not to be found in a calculus made easy. It would be found in algebra made easy. reply conwy 4 hours agorootparentYes, it's algebra. Math isn't like programming. In programming you can often solve a problem using a library, framework, language facility, etc. without entirely understanding why it works all the way down to the binary level. In math you can't often solve a more advanced problem such as Calculus problem without understanding the more foundational math such as algebra, fractions, etc. If \"information hiding\" / layers of abstraction was possible in math, I would have completed my university entrance course months ago, but here I am still struggling. Sure, we could have Algebra made easy and also Trigonometry made easy, Fractions made easy, Functions made easy, etc. etc. I just find it personally irritating that all this foundational knowledge is brushed aside when it's really core to someone's actual competence dealing with actual math problems. Maybe it's just assumed that people went to a good high school or had a private math tutor and already learned the foundations very well, but I think at least that assumption would be coming from a place of privilege. It's similar to telling someone to take a Bootcamp in React and that will be enough for them to succeed as a software engineer. But to solve the kind of problems they are going to face in reality they will eventually have to learn at least some foundational Javascript and maybe a little about algorithms and data structures. reply bakuninsbart 1 hour agorootparent> In math you can't often solve a more advanced problem such as Calculus problem without understanding the more foundational math such as algebra, fractions, etc. This is true to a good degree, but maybe a bit less so than you believe.

In the last step substitute the actual function back in and you have an incomplete, yet technically correct solution. reply goosejuice 4 hours agorootparentprevDo you find it surprising though? Certainly not everyone is in the same place in their learning journey as you. Material on calc, at a university level, is typically going to focus on calc.

For instance, it’s entirely possible to understand higher level mathematics without having much skill at all in pencil-and-paper arithmetic. I know this because one of my best friends in college got straight A’s in upper level mathematics and EE classes but, due to his unusual background, only bothered learning arithmetic when he needed to prepare for the GRE. I didn’t enjoy math as a child, and I used to be a lot more bitter about this when I first started to grasp what mathematics actually was. As a child, mathematics seemed like a small amount of “learn and understand a new abstract concept” (which I was pretty good at) bogged down with a huge amount of “okay now you have to solve a a bunch of problems based on that concept over and over again before we’ll trust you with another concept”. Eventually I figured out that mathematics itself really is the concepts, and that the concepts eventually build up to a level of complexity where it was increasingly challenging and fun to grasp them. Maybe the reason it’s taught this way is because the vast majority of people aren’t mathematicians and aren’t really attracted to mathematics out of an abstract intellectual appreciation for the beauty of mathematical concepts; they just want to solve problems. And this is perfectly reasonable. But if I had it to do over again, I probably would have put more effort into mathematics and study more of it, at much higher levels, if I knew it would eventually get a lot more interesting. And eventually things do start to branch out a bit. The standard K-12 curriculum up through calculus mostly builds up like a single tower where everything is built on everything else, but there are parts of mathematics where you can just sort of go in a different direction for awhile. reply hintymad 4 hours agorootparentprevAlgebra is the simple part. I’d say it’s more about math maturity. At least 1/3rd of my classmates had a hard time grasping the epsilon-delta definition of limit, let alone the deeper definitions like Cauchy sequence or those used in the proof that R is dense(and we were in an elite university’s competitive program). Among the survivors of single-variable calculus, at least 1/3 could barely get by the multi-variable calculus. I saw too many of my friends struggle with different integrals, and got massacred by Green’s equation.

My experience with programming is that once you get really really good with fundamentals you suddenly leap ahead and pick up new languages, paradigms, etc. incredibly fast. Maybe this partly explains the 10x phenomenon - it's because they worked very hard on the fundamentals. reply globalnode 2 hours agorootparentmy view is software by comparison is like a single surface of knowledge; once you know the basics, thats it, nothings too hard to learn. maths on the other hand is more like a volume of knowledge. reply beltsazar 2 hours agoparentprevI feel the opposite. In high school I was pretty good at solving calculus problems but had little understanding what \"limit\" actually is. When in college I finally understood the definition of limit and all the foundational theorems arised from it, I was blown away. For most people—who won't solve complex math problems daily at work—the takeaway from learning math is not their mechanical ability at solving math problems. The takeaway is their understanding of math concepts and ideas, which will shape their thinking skills in general. reply jasomill 1 hour agorootparentFor me, the biggest stumbling block in understanding the usual ε/δ limit definition in high school was teachers reading |x - a| as \"the absolute value of x minus a\" rather than \"the distance between x and a\". The later reading suggests a more intuitive (to me) definition: a limit f(x)→q as x→p exists if, for every open interval Y containing q, an open interval X containing p exists such that f(x)∊Y for all x≠p in X (and then if f(p)=q, f is also continuous at p). Another nice property of the above definition: replace \"interval\" with \"ball\" or \"neighborhood\" for analogous definitions for functions between metric and topological spaces, respectively. reply gofreddygo 4 hours agoparentprevSo you want to do calculus ? You need algebra. What parts of algebra ? Go figure ! this is one big hurdle in learning math backwards. You discover new missing pieces at every corner. Each missing piece leading to another missing piece. Learning math from the basics to advanced (as recommended by most) is very frustrating at how slowly you actually develop the math muscle. At a deeper level, conceptual grasp does not make you good at math, its not enough. You may fool yourself into thinking you \"get it\" till you try to solve a few exercises. You need to repeat the lower levels enough to make it into muscle memory (which some people refer to as math intuition or groundwork) before embarking onto higher levels that build on it. So working your way bottom up is slow and frustrating, top down is slow and frustrating. What do you do? Just keep at it. One key observation for me was that at some point the misery and rabbit hole nature diminishes, quite rapidly. The groundwork of solving all those exercises repeatedly pays off and the next set becomes a little easier. Getting to calculus after spending ridiculous amount of time on algebra is the only way I have known to work. And this is true for learning progamming too. knowing the concept of loops is essential but, you still can't write efficient code to sort an array. You need to get the syntax and write enough loops and then progress to exercising writing specific sorting algorithms repeatedly to get them into muscle memory. But there is an inflection point beyond which the same concepts repeat but in different variations and they take progressively lesser time to get a grasp on. thats just how I've learned math and programming. Also why a large percentage of people just give up hope and accept they just don't have the math gene. Meh. reply conwy 3 hours agorootparent> this is one big hurdle in learning math backwards. You discover new missing pieces at every corner. Each missing piece leading to another missing piece. Yes this is exactly what happening to me. E.g. I got up to Week 2 of the course and suddenly made the big (to me) discovery that sqrt(a/b) = sqrt(a)/sqrt(b). It seems trivial I know when you see it written like that, but the problem is to recognise and apply that principle in the context of a broader problem such as factoring. > Just keep at it.

My math skills stagnated in high school and then I went on studying computer science (avoiding almost all of the math) and came out pretty good in programming but still bad in math. I tried to read books like calculus made easy but it was still too dry and too hard. How I fixed it: 1. I learned to become bored and be okay with it. I sometimes lie on the ground for 15 minutes to an hour and do nothing (and that's different than meditation!). I feel incredibly bored, bored to tears actually. I have noticed when I'm in this state, I'm in a much better position to do math or anything else that I slightly find boring but also really interesting. 2. I went to the root of my problem. I'm Dutch. I failed a course in high school called wiskunde B (math B). It teaches calculus, vectors and trig. I'm currently doing that [1]. It's been a few months, but it's going well. Results and observations: I think I'm almost at the level to do actual college level math. It helps that I studied CS, because I know a ton of math channels on YouTube and they are now immensely helpful. The thing is the course I'm following isn't explaining the theory well. It is amazing in making me practice, so fortunately I just need to go to good YouTube channels such as 3Blue1Brown or Khan Academy for an adequate explanation on theory. Another observation is that it has made me a better programmer. My debugging style has always been \"turn on the debugger\". Now my debugging style is: think deeply about code execution first. Math makes me comfortable with \"code execution\" because with math you have no choice! __Looking for a math tutor (email in profile)__ I'm looking for a math tutor.

After an oral exam at a black board, was admitted to the second year. Majored in math. Took (so called) advanced calculus from Rudin's Principles .... Took applied advanced calculus from a famous MIT book from an MIT Ph.D. Taught calculus at Indiana University. Studied Fleming's Functions of Several Variables, right, through the inverse and implicit function theorems, Stokes formula, exterior algebra, etc. Published some advanced math, essentially advanced calculus. Once, with some calculus, at FedEx pleased the most serious investors on the Board, had them return their airline tickets back to Texas, stay after all, and saved the company. Okay, the 90 seconds: Consider a car, its speedometer and odometer. Calculus has two parts. For the first part, you read the data from the odometer and reconstruct the speedometer readings. Doing this, you take changes in (increments of, differences in) the odometer readings, say, every second. This is called differentiation. For the second part, you read the data from the speedometer and reconstruct the odometer readings. Doing this, you add the speedometer readings, say, every second. This is called integration. Starting with the odometer readings and differentiating to get the speedometer readings and then integrating the speedometer readings will give back the odometer readings -- this is the \"fundamental theorem of calculus\". ~90 seconds. For more, instead of the 1 second steps could use 0.1 seconds, .... 0.0001 seconds, etc. With really small steps, making them smaller will make no or nearly no difference. So, the reconstructions will have converged, reached a limit. Reaching this limit is mostly what was novel when Newton, Leibnitz, etc. invented calculus. It is fair to say that the first big application was to Newton's law F = ma where have some object -- baseball, airplane, rocket -- with mass m and are applying to the object force F. Then a is the acceleration of the object. Integrate the acceleration and get the velocity v. Integrate v and get distance d. So, can find where the rocket is after, say, 10 seconds. Other early applications were to planetary motion. There are applications to areas, volumes, classical mechanics. fluid flow, mechanical engineering, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, relativity, electrical and electronic engineering, e.g., Fourier theory. Physics and engineering are big users. And there are applications in economics, e.g., work of Arrow, Hurwicz, and Uzawa on the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. By the early 20th century, calculus was refined, e.g., presented with careful assumptions, definitions, theorems, and proofs, e.g., B. Riemann and, soon, H. Lebesgue. By then there was the idea of the highly irregular Brownian motion and the observation that differentiation wouldn't work there -- Brownian motion was differentiable nowhere! Calculus?

While I enjoy Silvanus book, I don't think calculus can be made easy without preparing the students to accept the handwaving and trickery involved in the jump from an equation to its 'area' or 'velocity'. Compared to the solemn majesty of euclidic trigonometry or relatively straightforward step-by-step solving of quadratic equations the techniques foundational to calculus are rather devious (as are those that bring in complex numbers). In high school the combination with physics made it harder for some students, they had the impression that learning math amounted to learning about nature, rather than a language for expressing fictions about a view of nature. In turn the approximative nature of the problem solving and calculus didn't fit very well. reply causality0 7 hours agoprevI liked math up until my pre-calc teacher told me I couldn't go any further until I memorized two dozen different trigonometric identities and was able to immediately identify which to use. reply BenFranklin100 7 hours agoparentThis is actually not a bad way to go.

(for context for someone who doesn't know, the idea is to define a number, k which is greater than all real numbers. If you take 1/k, you have a very small number and you can fit an infinite number of 1/k's between 0 and the \"next\" real number. This concept is what sold me on infinitesimals.)

These fragile wires are constantly breaking — a precarious system on which everything from banks to governments to TikTok depends. But thanks to a secretive global network of ships on standby, every broken cable is quickly fixed. This is the story of the people who repair the world’s most important infrastructure. The Verge homepage The cloud under the sea By Josh DziezaBy Josh Dzieza Art by Kristen RadtkeArt by Kristen Radtke Photography by Go TakayamaPhotography by Go Takayama The Verge homepage Apr 16, 2024, 2:00 PM GMT OnOn the afternoon of March 11th, 2011, Mitsuyoshi Hirai, the chief engineer of the cable maintenance ship Ocean Link, was sitting in his cabin 20 miles off Japan’s eastern coast, completing the paperwork that comes at the end of every repair. Two weeks earlier, something — you rarely knew what — damaged the 13,000-mile fiber optic cable connecting Kitaibaraki, Japan, and Point Arena, California. Alarms went off; calls were made; and the next day, Hirai was sailing out of the port in Yokohama to fix it. A camera mounted on the KDDI Ocean Link on March 11th, 2011. Loading ... The repair was now nearly done. All that remained was to rebury the cable on the seafloor, which they were doing using a bulldozer-sized remotely operated submersible named Marcas — and, of course, the paperwork. Suddenly, the ship began to shudder. Hirai got to his feet, found he could barely stand, and staggered out of his cabin, grasping the handrail as he pulled himself up the narrow stairway to the bridge. “Engine trouble?” Hirai asked the captain, who’d already checked and replied that everything seemed normal. The ship continued to tremble. Looking out from the bridge, the sea appeared to be boiling. Loading ... Loading ... Loading ... A sketch of the Ocean Link in port in Yokohama transitions into a video of the ship. A bird flies overhead and waves lap at its hull. They turned on the television. An emergency alert showed that an earthquake had struck 130 miles northeast of their location. The shaking finally stopped, and in the silence, Hirai’s mind leapt to what would come next: a tsunami. Hirai feared these waves more than most people. He had grown up hearing the story of how one afternoon in 1923, his aunt felt the ground shake, swept up her two-year-old brother, and sprinted uphill to the cemetery, narrowly escaping floods and fires that killed over 100,000 people. That child became Hirai’s father, so he owed his existence to his aunt’s quick thinking. Now, he found himself in the same position. He knew tsunamis become dangerous when all the water displaced by the quake reaches shallow water and slows and grows taller. The Ocean Link, floating in less than 500 feet of water, was too shallow for comfort. Mitsuyoshi Hirai, the former chief engineer of the Ocean Link. Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ... In the family tree of professions, submarine cable work occupies a lonely branch somewhere between heavy construction and neurosurgery. It’s precision engineering on a shifting sea using heavy metal hooks and high-tension lines that, if they snap, can cut a person in half. In Hirai’s three decades with Kokusai Cable Ship Company (KCS), he had learned that every step must be followed, no matter how chaotic the situation. Above all else, he often said, “you must always be cool.” Across Ocean Link’s 400-foot deck, the ship’s 50 crew members were emerging from their cabins and workstations, trying to figure out what had just occurred. Over the intercom, the captain announced that there had been an earthquake, a tsunami was coming, and the crew should ready the ship to evacuate to deeper water. The crew fanned out to check fuel tanks and lash down machinery. Inside a darkened, monitor-filled shipping container on the starboard deck, the submersible’s pilot steered Marcas back toward the ship as fast as the bulky robot’s propellers could carry it. Minutes later, the submersible was hoisted aboard and the Ocean Link was underway. Controls on the bridge of the Ocean Link. Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ...

The tsunami passed under them imperceptibly on their way out to sea, and when they came to a stop three hours later, the television was showing the first images of destruction. Members of the crew who weren’t working gathered on the bridge to watch the news, which continued to display a tsunami warning, a map of Japan with its eastern seaboard glowing red. They took turns trying to reach loved ones using the ship’s satellite phone, but no calls went through. As night fell, periodic aftershocks thumped against the hull. Hirai thought about his wife, who was working at a department store in Yokohama near the Ocean Link’s port; his son, a junior in high school at the time; and his parents, whom the family lived with in his hometown of Yokosuka — none of whom he’d been able to reach. Everyone had someone they were worried about. But Hirai also began to think about the work he knew lay ahead. The Ocean Link was one of a small number of ships that maintain the subsea cables that carry 99 percent of the world’s data. Positioned in strategic locations around the planet, these ships stand ready to sail out and fix faults the moment they are detected, and most of the time, they are more than equal to the task. But earthquakes, Hirai knew from experience, were different. They didn’t just break one cable — they broke many, and badly. If what he feared had happened, Japan risked being cut off from the world in its moment of need. Sure enough, that night, a call came from headquarters confirming the Ocean Link was safe and directing them to remain at sea until further notice, followed by messages announcing cable failure after cable failure, including the one they had just finished repairing.

Cable industry professionals tend to be pragmatic people, preoccupied with the material realities of working planet-scale construction. But in conversations about landing high-bandwidth cables in digitally neglected regions or putting millions of people back in contact with every fiber strand melted together, they often hint at a sense of larger purpose, an awareness that they are performing a function vital to a world that, if they do their jobs well, will continue to be unaware of their service. For the Ocean Link crew, this awareness was bound up in a still unfolding national tragedy. They knew that whenever they returned to land, they would have to care for their loved ones quickly, because they would soon be going back out to sea. For how long, no one knew. TheThe world’s emails, TikToks, classified memos, bank transfers, satellite surveillance, and FaceTime calls travel on cables that are about as thin as a garden hose. There are about 800,000 miles of these skinny tubes crisscrossing the Earth’s oceans, representing nearly 600 different systems, according to the industry tracking organization TeleGeography. The cables are buried near shore, but for the vast majority of their length, they just sit amid the gray ooze and alien creatures of the ocean floor, the hair-thin strands of glass at their center glowing with lasers encoding the world’s data. If, hypothetically, all these cables were to simultaneously break, modern civilization would cease to function. The financial system would immediately freeze. Currency trading would stop; stock exchanges would close. Banks and governments would be unable to move funds between countries because the Swift and US interbank systems both rely on submarine cables to settle over $10 trillion in transactions each day. In large swaths of the world, people would discover their credit cards no longer worked and ATMs would dispense no cash. As US Federal Reserve staff director Steve Malphrus said at a 2009 cable security conference, “When communications networks go down, the financial services sector does not grind to a halt. It snaps to a halt.” A map of the world showing the dozens of fibre optic cable systems which stretch across the oceans, connecting continents and island chains. Some of these cables are extremely long. The map animates to show the cables laid down between 1989 and the present, with planned cables up to 2027 also displayed.

Seemingly local institutions would be paralyzed as outsourced accounting, personnel, and customer service departments went dark. Governments, which rely on the same cables as everyone else for the vast majority of their communications, would be largely cut off from their overseas outposts and each other. Satellites would not be able to pick up even half a percent of the traffic. Contemplating the prospect of a mass cable cut to the UK, then-MP Rishi Sunak concluded, “Short of nuclear or biological warfare, it is difficult to think of a threat that could be more justifiably described as existential.” Fortunately, there is enough redundancy in the world’s cables to make it nearly impossible for a well-connected country to be cut off, but cable breaks do happen. On average, they happen every other day, about 200 times a year. The reason websites continue to load, bank transfers go through, and civilization persists is because of the thousand or so people living aboard 20-some ships stationed around the world, who race to fix each cable as soon as it breaks.

The industry responsible for this crucial work traces its origins back far beyond the internet, past even the telephone, to the early days of telegraphy. It’s invisible, underappreciated, analog. Few people set out to join the profession, mostly because few people know it exists. Hirai’s career path is characteristic in its circuitousness. Growing up in the 1960s in the industrial city of Yokosuka, just down the Miura Peninsula from the Ocean Link’s port in Yokohama, he worked at his parents’ fish market from the age of 12. A teenage love of American rock ‘n’ roll led to a desire to learn English, which led him to take a job at 18 as a switchboard operator at the telecom company KDDI as a means to practice. When he was 26, he transferred to a cable landing station in Okinawa because working on the beach would let him perfect his windsurfing. This was his introduction to cable maintenance and also where he met his wife. Six years later, his English proficiency got him called back to KDDI headquarters to help design Ocean Link for KCS, a KDDI subsidiary. Once it was built, he decided to go to sea with it, eventually becoming the ship’s chief engineer. Captain Shoichi Suzuki in the bridge of the Ocean Link. Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ... Others come to the field from merchant navies, marine construction, cable engineering, geology, optics, or other tangentially related disciplines. When Fumihide Kobayashi, the submersible operator — a tall and solidly built man from the mountain region of Nagano — joined KCS at the age of 20, he thought he would be working on ship maintenance, not working aboard a maintenance ship. He had never been on a boat before, but Hirai enticed him to stay with stories of all the whales and other marine creatures he would see on the remote ocean. Once people are in, they tend to stay. For some, it’s the adventure — repairing cables in the churning currents of the Congo Canyon, enduring hull-denting North Atlantic storms. Others find a sense of purpose in maintaining the infrastructure on which society depends, even if most people’s response when they hear about their job is, But isn’t the internet all satellites by now? The sheer scale of the work can be thrilling, too. People will sometimes note that these are the largest construction projects humanity has ever built or sum up a decades-long resume by saying they’ve laid enough cable to circle the planet six times. KCS has around 80 employees, many of whom, like Hirai, have worked there for decades. Because the industry is small and careers long, it can seem like everyone knows one another. People often refer to it as a family. Shipboard life lends itself to a strong sense of camaraderie, with periods of collaboration under pressure followed by long stretches — en route to a worksite or waiting for storms to pass — without much to do but hang out. Kobayashi learned to fish off the side of the ship and attempted to improve the repetitive cuisine by serving his crewmates sashimi. (His favorite is squid, but his colleagues would prefer he use the squid to catch mackerel.) Hirai, an enthusiastic athlete, figured out how to string up a net on the Ocean Link’s helideck and play tennis. Other times, he would join the crew for karaoke in the lounge, a wood-paneled room behind an anomalous stained-glass door containing massage chairs, a DVD library, and a bar. A self-described “walking jukebox,” Hirai favored Simon & Garfunkel and Billy Joel, though he said the younger members of the fleet didn’t go in for it as much. Galley aboard the Ocean Link.

The world is in the midst of a cable boom, with multiple new transoceanic lines announced every year. But there is growing concern that the industry responsible for maintaining these cables is running perilously lean. There are 77 cable ships in the world, according to data supplied by SubTel Forum, but most are focused on the more profitable work of laying new systems. Only 22 are designated for repair, and it’s an aging and eclectic fleet. Often, maintenance is their second act. Some, like Alcatel’s Ile de Molene, are converted tugs. Others, like Global Marine’s Wave Sentinel, were once ferries. Global Marine recently told Data Centre Dynamics that it’s trying to extend the life of its ships to 40 years, citing a lack of money. One out of 4 repair ships have already passed that milestone. The design life for bulk carriers and oil tankers, by contrast, is 20 years. “We’re all happy to spend billions to build new cables, but we’re not really thinking about how we’re going to look after them,” said Mike Constable, the former CEO of Huawei Marine Networks, who gave a presentation on the state of the maintenance fleet at an industry event in Singapore last year. “If you talk to the ship operators, they say it’s not sustainable anymore.” He pointed to a case last year when four of Vietnam’s five subsea cables went down, slowing the internet to a crawl. The cables hadn’t fallen victim to some catastrophic event. It was just the usual entropy of fishing, shipping, and technical failure. But with nearby ships already busy on other repairs, the cables didn’t get fixed for six months. (One promptly broke again.) But perhaps a greater threat to the industry’s long-term survival is that the people, like the ships, are getting old. In a profession learned almost entirely on the job, people take longer to train than ships to build.

He recalled another panel he was on in Singapore meant to introduce university students to the industry. “The audience was probably about 10 university kids and 60 old gray people from the industry just filling out their day,” he said. When he speaks with students looking to get into tech, he tries to convince them that subsea cables are also part — a foundational part — of the tech industry. “They all want to be data scientists and that sort of stuff,” he said. “But for me, I find this industry fascinating. You’re dealing with the most hostile environment on the planet, eight kilometers deep in the oceans, working with some pretty high technology, traveling all over the world. You’re on the forefront of geopolitics, and it’s critical for the whole way the world operates now.” The lifestyle can be an obstacle. A career in subsea means enduring long stretches far from home, unpredictable schedules, and ironically, very poor internet. Kaida Takashi aboard the Ocean Link. Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ... “Everyone complains about that,” said Kaida Takashi, a senior advisor at KCS, who is trying to get the Ocean Link set up with Starlink. It’s a generational difference, he said. For someone like him, a 62-year-old ham radio enthusiast, Wi-Fi barely fast enough to email is a luxury. Other industry veterans reminisced about the days when they felt fortunate to get faxes on board, or waiting for the mailbag in port, or the novelty of using the very cable they were laying to make calls from the middle of the ocean. But for people who grew up with an expectation of constant connectivity, the disconnection of shipboard life can cause visible discomfort. “It’s a part of them,” one industry veteran marveled of his younger colleagues. “They can’t let it go.” The industry’s biggest recruiting challenge, however, is the industry’s invisibility. It’s a truism that people don’t think about infrastructure until it breaks, but they tend not to think about the fixing of it, either. In his 2014 essay, “Rethinking Repair,” professor of information science Steven Jackson argued that contemporary thinking about technology romanticizes moments of invention over the ongoing work of maintenance, though it is equally important to the deployment of functional technology in the world. There are few better examples than the subsea cable industry, which, for over a century, has been so effective at quickly fixing faults that the public has rarely had a chance to notice. Or as one industry veteran put it, “We are one of the best-kept secrets in the world, because things just work.” TheThe Ocean Link spent two nights at sea before receiving orders to return. As they neared land, Hirai saw debris from the tsunami’s backwash floating in the water: fishing nets, tires, the roofs of buildings, the bloated body of what he guessed was a cow. The earthquake measured 9.1 on the Richter scale, the fourth largest ever recorded and the largest to ever hit Japan. But it was the series of tsunami waves that arrived half an hour later that dealt the most destruction, surging miles inland and sweeping buildings, cars, and thousands of people out to sea. The death toll would eventually climb to nearly 20,000, and the day would become a national tragedy referred to simply as “3/11.” The full extent of the devastation was still becoming clear when the Ocean Link returned, but the disaster had already entered a new phase. One hundred and sixty miles north of Tokyo, a 50-foot tsunami wave overtopped a seawall protecting the Fukushima power plant, swamping the emergency generators that were cooling the reactors through its automatic post-quake shutdown and precipitating a nuclear meltdown. Hirai’s wife and son had made it back home to their house in Yokosuka, where they lived with Hirai’s parents. Kobayashi’s family, too, was safe. Some crew lost loved ones; others sent family to stay with relatives in the south out of fear of radiation. They all knew that they had only a few days before they would be sent back out to sea.

The Ocean Link in a storm in the North Pacific. The ship pitches wildly in the heavy swell, the waves crashing over its bow. The disaster had severed phone lines and wrecked cell towers, causing phone service to cut out almost immediately after the earthquake struck. Instead, people turned to email, Skype, and other online services that were mostly able to route around damage to the network. There was a sense, according to one engineer’s postmortem presentation, that the internet was the only media that survived. But its survival was more tenuous than the public knew. While the cables connecting Japan to the rest of the world survived the initial destruction, later that night, as millions of people tried to find their way home with trains stopped and power intermittent, engineers in Tokyo network operation centers watched as one cable after another failed. By the next morning, seven of Japan’s 12 transpacific cables were severed. Engineers working through the night and following days managed to shift traffic to those that remained, but the new routes were near their maximum capacity. The head of telecom company NTT’s operation center at the time estimated that if another cable failed, it would have lost all traffic to the US. With servers for most major internet companies located there, Japan would have effectively lost the internet. Normally, the sequence of repairs would be determined by whichever cable owner reported the fault first, but given the extraordinary circumstances, the usually self-interested cable owners agreed to defer to KCS. The priority was to repair a cable — any cable — as fast as possible. It was impossible to know the state of the cables on the ocean floor, so like forensic investigators, Hirai and the other engineers had to work with the sparse facts available. By having the cable landing stations on either side of the ocean beam light down their end of the line and time the reflections back, they were able to locate the faults nearest to them within a few meters. Most of the faults lay in deep water, in the canyons channeling into the Japan Trench. This, plus the timing of the faults, indicated it wasn’t the quake that broke them but the underwater avalanches it triggered. “It hasn’t changed in 150 years... The Victorians did it that way and we’re doing it the same way.” Submarine landslides are awesome events whose existence was only discovered in the 1950s, when scientists analyzed the timing of 12 cable faults that severed communication between Europe and North America two decades earlier. Before then, according to oceanographer Mike Clare, “It was assumed that deep water was boring and nothing happens down there.” In fact, the ocean floor is riven with mountains and canyons that experience avalanches that dwarf anything found on land, cascades of sediment and debris racing for hundreds of miles. Hirai had dealt with them in Taiwan in 2006, one of the most notorious events in the annals of cable repair. On December 26th, an earthquake dislodged sediment on Taiwan’s southern coast and sent it rushing 160 miles into the Luzon Strait, one of several global cable chokepoints. Nine cables were severed and Taiwan was knocked almost entirely offline. Banking, airlines, and communications were disrupted throughout the region. Trading of the Korean won was halted. The cables, buried under mountains of debris, were nearly impossible to find. It took 11 ships, including the Ocean Link, nearly two months to finish repairs. Often in a multi-cable disaster like the Taiwan earthquake, every ship in the region comes to assist. But with Japan, there was an unprecedented complication: the majority of the faults were located offshore of the ongoing nuclear meltdown at Fukushima. Ship operators deemed assistance too risky, which meant that, for the time being, the Ocean Link was on its own. The crew felt not only duty bound to work but uniquely capable of doing so. They had dealt with radiation before, though not at this scale. In 1993, shortly before the Ocean Link was to lay a cable linking Japan, Korea, and Russia, they learned the Soviets had dumped radioactive waste in the ocean along the planned route. With some trepidation, KCS proceeded with the job. They bought Geiger counters and protective gear, flew in nurses from the US with chemical weapons training, and scanned the water for radiation as they went. When none was detected, they put the gear in storage. Now, as they readied the ship for departure, an employee was dispatched to the depot to find the old radiation gear. A local university donated a few more sensors and trained the crew on how to use them. They decided to begin with the same cable they had just finished repairing when the earthquake struck. On a drizzling afternoon eight days after returning to port, with smoke still rising from the Fukushima power plant, the Ocean Link set back out to sea. Spare cables spooled in the KCS depot.

ToTo the extent he is remembered, Cyrus Field is known to history as the person responsible for running a telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean, but he also conducted what at the time was considered an equally great technical feat: the first deep-sea cable repair. Field, a 35-year-old self-made paper tycoon, had no experience in telegraphy — which helps explain why, in 1854, he embarked on such a quixotic mission. Though small bodies of water like the English Channel had been bridged by telegraph, failure was routine and costly. Cables shorted out, snapped under tension, snagged on rocks, were sliced by anchors, twisted by currents, tangled around whales, attacked by swordfish, and devoured by a “miserable little mollusc” called the Teredo worm with an appetite for jute insulation. Field fared no better. Twelve years after he began, he had endured severed cables, near sinkings, and had one “success”: a cable laid in 1858 that prompted celebrations so enthusiastic that revelers set fire to New York City Hall. The cable failed weeks later. The SS Great Eastern attempting to recover the broken transatlantic telegraph cable in 1865. Photo by Universal Images Group via Getty Loading ...

Cyrus West Field, who financed and organized the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cables. Photo by Getty Images Loading ... Field tried again seven years later only for the cable to snap halfway across the Atlantic. The next year, he set out yet again, promising not only to finally lay a working transatlantic cable but to recover the broken cable and finish that one, too. By that time, a crude method had been developed for fixing cables in shallow water. A ship would drag a hooked grapnel anchor across the seafloor, until, like the tremor of a fishing line, increasing tension showed they’d caught the cable, which they would then haul on board to fix. Field’s plan was basically this but bigger: bigger hooks, stronger rope, more powerful winding engine, all aboard the largest ship afloat, a passenger liner called the SS Great Eastern that had been retrofitted for the mission. William Thomson, the project’s scientific adviser and the future Lord Kelvin, did the math and deemed it feasible. “When it was first proposed to drag the bottom of the Atlantic for a cable lost in waters two and a half miles deep, the project was so daring that it seemed to be almost a war of the Titans upon the gods,” wrote Cyrus’ brother Henry. “Yet never was anything undertaken less in the spirit of reckless desperation. The cable was recovered as a city is taken by siege — by slow approaches, and the sure and inevitable result of mathematical calculation.” Humans continue to be by far the single greatest threat to cables Field’s crew caught the cable on the first try and nearly had it aboard when the rope snapped and slipped back into the sea. After 28 more failed attempts, they caught it again. When they brought it aboard and found it still worked, the crew fired rockets in celebration. Field withdrew to his cabin, locked the door, and wept. Cable repair today works more or less the same as in Field’s day. There have been some refinements: ships now hold steady using automated dynamic positioning systems rather than churning paddle wheels in opposite directions, and Field’s pronged anchor has spawned a medieval-looking arsenal of grapnels — long chains called “rennies,” diamond-shaped “flat fish,” spring-loaded six-blade “son of sammys,” three-ton detrenchers with seven-foot blades for digging through marine muck — but at its core, cable repair is still a matter of a ship dragging a big hook along the ocean floor. Newfangled technologies like remotely operated submersibles can be useful in shallow water, but beyond 8,000 feet or so, conditions are so punishing that simple is best. 00 ft Euphotic (Sunlight) zone 656 ft Dysphotic (Twilight) zone 3,280 ft Bathypelagic (Midnight) zone 13,123 ft Abyssopelagic (abyssal) zone 19,685 ft Hadopelagic (hadal) zone A schematic view of the ocean depths, with the Ocean Link at the surface. A cable leads down from the ship into the depths. We pass through the Euphotic (Sunlight) zone where familiar animals live, before hitting the twilight zone 656 ft below sea level. The fauna gets more exotic and the light dimmer until we reach the Bathypelagic (Midnight) zone, at 3,280 ft. Here we see giant squid and anglerfish. Travelling further, the Abyssopelagic (abyssal) zone starts at 13,123 ft, and features a couple of weird fish and cephalopods. Finally, the cable terminates in a grapnel in the Hadopelagic (hadal) zone at 19,685 ft. It has hooked its target. The deepest repair the Ocean Link conducted in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake was 6,200 meters (20,340 feet). “It hasn’t changed in 150 years,” said Alasdair Wilkie, chair of the Atlantic Cable Maintenance & Repair Agreement (ACMA). “The Victorians did it that way and we’re doing it the same way. I just think it’s one of those things that, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Nor have the causes of faults changed in the last century and a half. The first submarine cable, strung across the English Channel in 1850, survived for a single day before — in what may be apocryphal cable industry slander — a French eel fisherman accidentally hooked it, sliced off a piece, and came ashore bragging about his discovery of a new type of metal seaweed. In his history of global telecommunications, How the World Was One, Arthur C. Clarke declared this the first blow in a war between cable companies and other users of the sea that has continued to this day. Loading ... Loading ... Loading ... A sketch of the Ocean Link from the foredeck transitions into a video of the ship in port. Humans continue to be by far the single greatest threat to cables. Fishing accounts for about 40 percent of faults, according to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC). Bottom trawling, particularly as it extends into new regions and deeper water in pursuit of depleting fish stocks, is especially damaging. Last year, Chinese fishing vessels severed cables to one of Taiwan’s outlying islands, triggering an international incident. (Severing Taiwan’s cables is one of the first moves in war games of a Chinese siege.) The year before, trawlers cut multiple cables off the coast of Scotland, knocking several islands offline. Dragged anchors from cruise ships, cargo vessels, and pleasure boats are another common culprit. Last year, an improperly moored mega yacht knocked out all communication for the Caribbean island of Anguilla. The fiber strands at the core of submarine cables.

One thing that is not a threat to cables, many in the industry are eager to emphasize, is sharks. The idea that sharks eat submarine cables — repeated in news stories and even some government reports — stems from an incident in the late 1980s when AT&T was testing one of the first subsea fiber optic cables off the coast of the Canary Islands. The cable kept suffering mysterious faults, and when a repair ship hauled it up, teeth were found embedded near the breaks. A study was launched. Bell Labs scientists measured jaw radii and bite strength and, at one point, tried to feed captured sharks samples of cable. The culprit turned out to be a deepwater crocodile shark, possibly attracted to the electromagnetic field emitted from the power repeaters. Wrapping cables in metal tape seems to have solved any shark problems. Nevertheless, when an old YouTube video of a shark biting a cable went viral in 2014, it incited global news coverage. The ICPC issued a statement (“Sharks are not the nemesis of the internet — ICPC findings”) saying that it didn’t even look like a data cable, fish bites haven’t caused a fault in many years, and that humans are almost always to blame. Yet the myth endures, possibly because there is something satisfying about the idea of the modern world being brought down by the appetites of a prehistoric creature, and possibly because the idea of sharks eating the internet seems only slightly less improbable than the internet consisting of tubes on the bottom of the sea. OnOn March 22nd, with the world’s attention fixed on the crisis at Fukushima, the Ocean Link reached its worksite 160 miles to the south. They had chosen one of the faults farthest from the meltdown, but the winter wind was blowing from the north and the crew remained inside the ship until it was deemed safe to go outside. As the chief engineer and one of the oldest members of the crew, Hirai felt it was his duty to perform the radiation checks. He pulled on the slick yellow coveralls and boots, strapped on a mask and goggles, and opened the heavy steel door leading to the foredeck. The sky was overcast and low, and the ship rocked on a building swell as Hirai walked out onto the pocked green-painted deck and held out the wand of his Geiger counter to see what the wind carried. To his relief, it registered only background radiation. Next, he walked to the side and lowered a sensor into the sea. Again, nothing. He would do it all again in two hours, but for now, work could begin. They spent the first day and night surveying the worksite, moving slowly along the cable route while measuring the depth and current. Conditions worsened overnight and dawn greeted them with 15-foot waves and gale-force winds, too violent for delicate cable work. They would have to wait. At the most basic level, a broken cable is fixed by patching the break with a piece of new cable, but because the break is miles away on the ocean floor, this must be done in several steps. The first step is to cut the cable near the break (often, the cable will have been damaged but not cleanly severed, and cables are laid with so little slack that they cannot be pulled to the surface in one piece). This is done by dragging a bladed grapnel across the cable in a so-called “cutting drive.” The ship then swaps the bladed grapnel for a hooked one and catches one end of the severed cable, hoists it to the surface, and attaches it to a buoy. Then they catch the other cable end, splice the spare cable to it, and tow the spare cable back to the first buoyed cable to complete the patch. The ship is now holding a working cable but one that is considerably longer than it used to be. This process of bringing each cable end to the surface separately means that every repair makes a cable longer — in deep water, by several miles. In order to minimize slack that could get tangled and snagged, the loop of new cable is towed to the side of the original route until it can lay taut on the ocean floor once again.

The Ocean Link had repaired this same stretch of cable five years earlier, which meant they had already added the slack required to bring it to the surface, no cutting required. It should have been sitting on the seafloor in the form of a 12-mile loop. If they could catch it, Hirai reasoned, they would save time and — this was important — precious spare cable. Every cable ship is stationed next to a depot with a certain amount of spare cable for each system in its jurisdiction. If the Ocean Link used too much on their first repair, it would take six months to manufacture and deliver enough new cable to fix the remaining faults. By the afternoon, the Ocean Link was still plunging through heavy seas, but with the storm predicted to pass overnight, they decided to begin. From the arsenal of yellow-enameled grapnels strapped to the foredeck, Hirai selected a “jamming-type sliding prong,” a mace-like implement comprised of two metal bars studded with foot-long barbs, well suited for dragging across rocky seabed without getting stuck. They lowered it over the bow sheave and into the water. The ocean floor was more than three miles down, and it took the grapnel more than six hours to hit bottom. The Ocean Link began to move slowly forward. From this point onward, Hirai or another engineer would be in the cable control room — an instrument-filled command center behind the bridge — their attention fixed on the tension meter, a circular dial set into a pale green wall. The retro-looking analog gauge was less precise than a digital one but far better for intuitively conveying changes in tension than a jittery numerical readout. The steady wavering of its arm would mean the grapnel was plowing through the gray ooze of the ocean floors. A staccato spike; they had hooked a rock. A steady rise; the cable had been caught. Part of being an effective chief engineer, Hirai found, was the ability to read what was happening on the ocean floor from the limited information of the moving dial. At 6AM the next day, the engineer on duty saw the telltale rise of a caught cable, and the Ocean Link came to a stop. They had hooked the cable on the first run — rare in an earthquake repair — and began to reel it in. The ships are aging; the people are aging; and it’s unclear where the money will come from to turn things around Almost immediately, there was a sign something was amiss. The tension was rising too high too fast. The cable must be pinned under debris, Hirai thought. He ordered the winding engine to slow lest the cable snap, reeling in the grapnel at a grinding 10 feet per minute. The morning passed, then the afternoon, Hirai suiting up every few hours to check for radiation. The drum engine continued its slow rotation. Night fell. Half past midnight, after 19 hours of winding, the cable reached the surface. The grapnel came over the bow and was illuminated by the deck lights. Hirai was horrified at what he saw. They had caught the cable, but it was mangled unlike anything he had seen before. Hooked around one of the grapnel’s lower barbs, the cable’s polyethylene and wire sheath had been stripped by extreme tension and sprang in coiled loops like Slinkys put through a dryer. It was a dangerous situation. There was no telling how much tension a cable this badly damaged could withstand. It was like a three-mile rubber band stretched tight from the ocean floor, being tested with every rocking wave. If it snapped, the grapnel would fly across the deck, killing anyone it hit before smashing into the cable engine room. They had to get the cable off the ship, but doing so involved working closely with the explosive bundle hovering, taut, above the deck. First, crew members lashed chains to either end of the cable to take the tension off the grapnel, which they then swapped for a version with a sharp blade at its center, typically used for severing cables on the ocean floor. This done, they evacuated the foredeck. The grapnel, cable, and chains were slowly lowered back over the prow and into the sea, the ship maneuvering delicately to minimize any sudden changes in tension. Once the cable was safely beneath the waves, they released the chains. Suddenly, pulled tight over the blade, the cable split and sank back to the ocean floor. For Hirai, relief at a disaster averted was soon followed by foreboding. The landslides created by the earthquake must have been far greater than he had imagined, dragging the cable for miles, mangling it, and burying it beneath who knew how much debris. He couldn’t think how to proceed. The cable tension meter and other indicators in the Ocean Link’s cable control room. Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ... DebatesDebates about the future of cable repair have become a staple of industry events. They typically begin with a few key facts: the ships are aging; the people are aging; and it’s unclear where the money will come from to turn things around. For much of the 20th century, cable maintenance wasn’t a distinct business; it was just something giant, vertically integrated telecom monopolies had to do in order to function. As they started laying coaxial cables in the 1950s, they decided to pool resources. Rather than each company having its own repair vessel mostly sitting idle, they divided the oceans into zones, each with a few designated repair ships. When the telcos were split up at the turn of the century, their marine divisions were sold off. Cable & Wireless Marine became Global Marine. AT&T’s division is now the New Jersey-based SubCom. (Both are now owned by private equity companies; KCS remains a subsidiary of KDDI.) The zone system continued, now governed by contracts between cable owners and ship operators. Cable owners can sign up with a nonprofit cooperative, like the Atlantic Cable Maintenance & Repair Agreement, and pay an annual fee plus a day rate for repairs. In exchange, the zone’s three ships — a Global Marine vessel in Portland, UK, another in Curaçao, and an Orange Marine vessel in Brest, France — will stand ready to sail out within 24 hours of being notified of a fault. This system has been able to cope with the day-to-day cadence of cable breaks, but margins are thin and contracts are short-term, making it difficult to convince investors to spend $100 million on a new vessel. “The main issue for me in the industry has to do with hyperscalers coming in and saying we need to reduce costs every year,” said Wilkie, the chair of the ACMA, using the industry term for tech giants like Google and Meta. “We’d all like to have maintenance cheaper, but the cost of running a ship doesn’t actually change much from year to year. It goes up, actually. So there has been a severe lack of investment in new ships.” At the same time, there are more cables to repair than ever, also partly a result of the tech giants entering the industry. Starting around 2016, tech companies that previously purchased bandwidth from telcos began pouring billions of dollars into cable systems of their own, seeking to ensure their cloud services were always available and content libraries synced. The result has been not just a boom in new cables but a change in the topology of the internet. “In the old days we connected population centers,” said Constable, the former Huawei Marine executive. “Now we connect data centers. Eighty percent of traffic crossing the Atlantic is probably machines talking to machines.” A cable ship repairing a transpacific cable in 1972. Photo by Fairfax Media via Getty Images Loading ... Maintenance providers regard these changes with ambivalence. The cable boom means there will be no shortage of cables to fix, but it also means a future of negotiating with a handful of tech giants that can use their tremendous buying power to squeeze ship operators further. Market forces pose one challenge; geopolitics another. Tensions with China, including the increasing difficulty of getting permission to repair cables in the contested waters of the South China Sea, are contributing to decisions to route new systems through the Philippines and other less direct passages. Conflict in the Middle East has the industry looking nervously at the Red Sea, an infamous cable chokepoint: in February, a freighter struck by Houthi rockets dragged its anchor across three crucial connections between Asia and Europe, degrading connectivity and raising the frightening prospect of conducting repairs under fire. The Red Sea vulnerability has in turn renewed interest in an Arctic route, made potentially feasible by melting sea ice, though, for years, one of the fatal flaws of this proposal has been the question of who would repair such a cable, there being no ice-capable maintenance vessels. These and other recent events, like the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosion, have led governments to take a greater interest in cable security, often focusing on the specter of a deliberate attack. Late last year, NATO convened a symposium on undersea infrastructure and the future of “seabed warfare,” while the UK commissioned naval vessels to patrol their subsea connections. Meanwhile, the European Union, India, and other governments have proposed investing in maintenance vessels directly. “The amount of ships is relatively limited, and there are a number of places where it could get critical,” said Christian Bueger, the lead author of a 2022 EU Parliament study on threats to subsea data infrastructure. As part of the study, he visited a cable repair ship in Cape Town, South Africa. It was old, he said, with oily, clanging machinery demanding hard physical labor — the opposite of the clean digital space he associated with the internet. One of his recommendations was that governments figure out a way to invest in cable fleets rather than rely on companies focused on cost cutting and efficiency. The situation of SubCom illustrates the industry’s strange moment. The company has been withdrawing from maintenance work, according to industry sources, in order to focus on more lucrative installations, many of which are for Google. At the same time, the company is increasingly intertwined with the US government, which waged a pressure campaign to help SubCom beat China’s HMN Tech for the contract to build a major Asia-to-Europe cable, according to Reuters. SubCom also recently won a contract to operate the US’s first “cable security fleet.” Like the involvement of the tech giants, industry veterans regard this new government interest with ambivalence. More funding would be welcome, but the world of subsea cables is one of unforgiving tradeoffs, and it’s easy for well-intentioned policies to go awry. One often proposed solution, for example, is to corral cables into protected corridors, which can make them easier to guard against malicious actors but also makes it possible for a single landslide to take them all out at once. “Did any of us know that we went viral on TikTok?” Secrecy, too, is a double-edged sword. Classifying cable locations might make them more difficult to attack while worsening exposure to what is their actual greatest threat: fishing accidents and other forms of human negligence. Greater secrecy could also heighten the tension between the industry’s near-total obscurity and its need for new recruits. Ships are a relatively easy problem to solve; they just take money. People take years to train. The submarine cable world has never been particularly public. The industry is small and competitive, and cable owners don’t want their cables to get a reputation for breaking, so they bind maintenance providers with nondisclosure agreements. The result is that in the rare case that a fault reaches public awareness, ship operators almost never talk about it. Add in national security concerns, and the result is a code of silence that pervades the entire business. (Which is also why many of the sources in this story are “industry veterans” or other anonymous descriptors.) The industry has begun to recognize that this poses a recruiting challenge. In 2022, the industry organization SubOptic gathered six cable employees in their 20s and 30s for a panel on the future of the industry. Most of them had stumbled into their jobs inadvertently after college, and the consensus was that the industry needed to be much better about raising public awareness, especially among the young. “I don’t know if anyone saw, but during the pandemic, submarine cables actually went viral on TikTok,” said one panelist, a young cable engineer from Vodafone. “People didn’t know they existed, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, they were viral. I think it’s engaging with youth and children through their own avenues — yes, you can have science museums and things like that, but they are online, they are on their iPads, they’re on their phones.” “We’ve got some pretty senior decision-makers and influencers in the subsea cable industry here,” said one audience member. “Did any of us know that we went viral on TikTok?” he asked, to laughter. “As this panel rightfully said upfront, it’s not that we have a brand problem,” said another audience member, “we just don’t have a brand at all.” ItIt took the Ocean Link a month to complete its first repair. Failed grapnel runs, fishing gear entanglements, repeated radiation checks, and storms: it had been among the most difficult repairs Hirai had faced. They continued to work through the spring, but by June, they faced a dilemma. Many of the remaining faults lay 50 miles off the coast of Chiba, deep in the Japan Trench, where eight different cable lines passed near and sometimes over each other. It was a cable chokepoint, and a landslide must have crashed down and wrecked them all. It would be difficult to catch one without cutting its neighbor. Even if they could, it wasn’t clear they had enough spare cable to fix each fault individually, with all the loops of slack they would need to add to bring the cables to the surface. Hirai decided the only solution was to abandon the tangled mess and lay a new system on top of it. It would mean abandoning miles of cable as well as a branching unit: a 2,000-pound device that splits one cable into two different lines going to two destinations. But by reducing the number of loops, it would reduce the amount of cable required. Even then, it wasn’t clear they had enough. They did, however, have a lot of small bits of cable they had been careful to salvage during previous repairs — three miles here, five miles there. With a lot of work, they could be spliced together. Takashi Kurokawa had joined KCS 12 years earlier, after hearing about the company from a teacher while in engineering school. Unlike many of his colleagues who moved roles every few years, after Kurokawa learned to joint, he just kept jointing. He enjoyed the way jointing’s strict rules and standards for success created a structure within which he could push himself to attain ever greater precision and speed. Takashi Kurokawa preparing to splice a fiber. Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ... The work is extraordinarily delicate. Cables must be stripped of their polyurethane sheaths, copper conducting tubes, wire armor, and enamel coating until the clear glass threads themselves are exposed. Kurokawa then takes a glass strand from each cable, cleans them in a sonic bath (touching them risks damage and splinters), cleaves their ends at perfect right angles, and places them inside a black toaster-sized box called a fusion splicer, their ends almost but not quite touching. In an instant, the device aligns the ends and zaps an electric arc between them, melting the glass together. Kurokawa then winds the newly spliced fiber into a metal tube called a joint box and does it all again for the next fiber strand. The entire process can take 20 hours, with Kurokawa and his team working in shifts. Every step demands hunched, jeweler-like focus as they seek perfect precision — not in a seismically isolated clean room but in the belly of a rocking ship. Each joint is expected to function untouched under crushing pressure for at least 25 years. To speed matters, they decided to assemble what they could in port at Yokohama, with the Ocean Link moored and relatively stable. Working in shifts over 10 days, Kurokawa and his colleagues spliced 10 joints, four repeaters, and a branching unit — assembling a three-part, 100-mile system from the spare bits of cable they had on hand. At night, he dreamed of winding cables back and forth between storage tanks to get at the segments he needed. On June 26th, they tested the apparatus. It worked. They set sail the same day, with no estimate for how long it would take. Hirai had mapped out the plan to a meticulous 23 steps. They began by severing the cable running from the branching unit to Murayama in the south, catching the landward end, splicing the new cable to it, and sailing northward to the point where they planned to deposit the new branching unit. There, they attached the cable to a buoy and lowered it into the ocean. Then they were off to the northern cable, which they caught, spliced, and pulled back to the buoy. It took 12 days to get here, and now came the difficult part. The cable jointing station aboard the Ocean Link. Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ... Vise for holding cables during repairs.

Each completed fiber splice is placed inside a sealed enclosure called a “joint box.” Photo by Go Takayama for The Verge Loading ... The final splice is the most precarious moment of the repair. On the first splice, the ship can pivot 360 degrees around the dangling cable in order to angle into the wind and waves and maintain position. But on the second splice, there are two cables hanging off the prow, and the ship’s maneuverability is far more restricted should the weather turn foul. With the branching unit, they had to complete two final splices — one for each leg — then deposit the whole apparatus to the ocean floor intact. This, the Ocean Link crew knew, would be its own challenge. A 2,000-pound weight dangling for miles through the water column can do funny things. In 2008, the Ocean Link was called to recover a branching unit that another cable ship accidentally dropped into the Japan Trench while trying to deploy it. With a typhoon approaching, they caught the cable, brought up the unit, and fashioned a webbing loincloth-like harness between the unit’s two legs for additional support before lowering it back to the bottom. They would again be working in deep water — nearly four miles — but what troubled Hirai was the current. A powerful river of warm water called the Kuroshio Current snakes unpredictably up from the south along Japan’s coast, and it happened to be racing through the worksite at four knots, aquamarine and glittering in the summer sun. The Ocean Link would have to constantly adjust its thrusters to maintain position against the stream and prevent the branching unit from banging against the hull as it descended. But the weather was fair and the swell was light, so they decided to proceed. Hirai, Kurokawa, Kobayashi, and more than a dozen other members of the crew assembled on the foredeck. The white-painted prow glared bright in the sun as the branching unit was brought out, a metal tube with two black accordion legs that tapered to slender cables. They had drilled this maneuver before leaving port. Clad in hard hats, the crew gingerly placed it on a metal dolly and strapped it down. Hirai tied yellow webbing between its legs to form a harness and affixed a safety rope. Kurokawa stood by the prow, watching the unit as it was rolled toward him. Kobayashi stood back by the drum engine, watching the cable unspool and worrying what would happen if it snapped, envisioning weeks of splicing plunging to the ocean floor. The crew of the Ocean Link in 2011. Photo by Mitsuyoshi Hirai Loading ... The ship’s thrusters hummed and moved the Ocean Link ever so slowly backward. One end of the branching unit lifted off the dolly as it was pulled up onto the bow sheave. To an observer, the ship would look nearly stationary as the current flowed around it. The unit went over the top of the prow and descended, hanging from its harness, until it slipped below the surface and out of sight. It was August by the time the Ocean Link finished the branching unit repair. Other ships, deeming the crisis at Fukushima stable enough to work, had arrived to help. Hirai sometimes advised them on the area’s tricky currents and rugged bathymetry, but mostly, they stayed out of each other’s way; the last thing you want to do is tangle two grapnels. The final repair was an easy one. They had to finish the job that had been interrupted by the earthquake nearly five months earlier. They returned to the site where they had made their rushed escape, deployed the submersible, and buried the rest of the cable beneath the sand. The repair was so close to port that there was no time to celebrate during their return, nor was there much of a mood to do so. The earthquake had caused more than 20 faults, and the Ocean Link had repaired 11 of them. It had taken 154 days of continuous work. They had missed a time of national mourning, school graduations, harvest celebrations, and the slow resumption of normalcy. After they docked, the crew departed for their homes. Hirai stayed behind to finish writing his final daily report, then made for home as well. As he rode the train back to Yokosuka, he watched his fellow passengers absorbed in their phones. We completed the job, he thought with satisfaction, and they have no idea. Creative Director: Kristen RadtkePhoto Editor: Amelia Holowaty KralesEngineer: Graham MacAree",

A buddy of mine is an ROV operator for pipe-laying ships. Cool stuff, big stuff, and lots of crazy stuff involved (seeing weird, unidentifiable living creatures quickly and blurrily cross in front of the ROV's camera, etc.). I remained hidden below water as a technical show diver, while 1800 to 2000 audience members topside were getting impatient with a \"technical delay\" show pause. Typically, we were checking for faults in safety systems on underwater lifts, or for a potential hydraulics leak. We'd exit under the audience seating and go back to work after clearing the issue. In a world filled with high-tech desk jobs, finance, and non-tangible products, and having grown up working class, I have great respect for all the people behind the scenes physically keeping our tenuous world together. Some of this became readily apparent with once invisible food delivery and restaurant workers during COVID. Healthcare workers obviously came into their own too, but so many other workers were still taken for granted. I visualize a person huffing when their internet is slow or intermittent with a guy out to sea working during a storm or under difficult conditions and I laugh at the juxtaposition and perspective of both. I also do rope work and had to resort to doing more of it during COVID because my 'desk work' dried up a bit. Hanging 300ft off of a building with a black balaclava and mask with all-black rigging equipment in NJ doing a facade inspection across from the FBI building was certainly a memorable one. (Note: all-black equipment is standard for theater and entertainment work to stay hidden. I did confirm the FBI building people were informed there would be 4 guys on ropes that day.

I agree that most articles that start with slides are just dross, this one is an exception. reply Kalium 19 hours agorootparentprevThe article fails the marshmallow test - it needs to convince people that there is a traditional, long-form article that will be a rewarding read from the start. Only then is the test relevant to humans. Otherwise, all that's really being tested is the reader's trust in the publisher. reply jasode 19 hours agorootparentprev>You failed the marshmallow test [1]. There is a traditional, long-form article that presents a rewarding read. I didn't downvote but reading an unknown article with unknown or non-existent payoff is not the same premise as The Marshmallow Test because the Stanford experiment explicitly specifies the \"reward\" upfront: \">, a child was offered a choice between one small but immediate reward, or two small rewards if they waited for a period of time.\" In contrast, reading unfamiliar articles to _maybe_ get a \"reward\" is a Bayesian Probability. As the one reads each sentence that's not engaging, the expectation that there might be a \"reward\" at the end is tainted by the fact that most long articles in the past that reader forced themselves to finish didn't present a worthwhile reward at the end. Now, if JumpCrisscross explicitly told the reader that there would be a guaranteed mind-blowing insight payoff at the end of the long article before the reader started it, then the test of that patience would be closer to The Marshmallow test. reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparentIt’s not a random article.

You'd have to tell him before he considered reading the article for it to be more analogous to The Marshmallow Test. In other words, he can't \"fail\" your Marshmallow Test if you never set up the proper conditions for the test. >It’s not a random article. It’s been upvoted to the HN front page. Yes, being on the front page is one potential signal of quality but HN audience is diverse in reading preferences. Because you happen to like this article and the front page upvotes confirms your bias, I just want to go meta and point out how some others on HN would dislike this type of \"long-form human interest\" article. My previous comments about that - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24270673 - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26698153 This thread's article is not a fast-moving explanation about undersea cable logistics (e.g. Wendover Productions style). Instead, it frames the narrative around people such as Mitsuyoshi Hirai with long biographical sentences such as this: >, Hirai’s mind leapt to what would come next: a tsunami. Hirai feared these waves more than most people. He had grown up hearing the story of how one afternoon in 1923, his aunt felt the ground shake, swept up her two-year-old brother, and sprinted uphill to the cemetery, narrowly escaping floods and fires that killed over 100,000 people. That child became Hirai’s father, so he owed his existence to his aunt’s quick thinking. [...] Hirai’s career path is characteristic in its circuitousness. Growing up in the 1960s in the industrial city of Yokosuka, just down the Miura Peninsula from the Ocean Link’s port in Yokohama, he worked at his parents’ fish market from the age of 12. A teenage love of American rock ‘n’ roll led to a desire to learn English, which led him to take a job at 18 as a switchboard operator at the telecom company KDDI as a means to practice. When he was 26, he transferred to a cable landing station in Okinawa because working on the beach would let him perfect his windsurfing. This was his introduction to cable maintenance and also where he met his wife. Six years later, his English proficiency got him called back to KDDI headquarters to help design Ocean Link for KCS, a KDDI subsidiary. A lot of readers prefer not to slog through text like that if they're really just interested in the undersea cables. It's not just the dynamic sliding photos that would dissuade potential readers to finish the article but the style of writing itself. EDIT reply to >Lots of people don’t like dense books either. Well, this subthread you replied to was literally complaining, \">, since the information density is too low\" reply JumpCrisscross 18 hours agorootparent> lot of readers prefer not to slog through text like that Sure?

The book discusses \"Operation Ivy Bells\" whose mission was to tap the underwater Soviet communication lines during the Cold War. The submarine installed a recording pod onto Soviet cables and recorded everything. How did they find the cables? A technician told a story about growing up on the Mississippi river, and how you could often find a sign on the bank, telling you that there were underwater cables. He hypothesized that the same thing might exist in the Soviet union. Sure enough, the submarine secretly crept into Soviet water, popped the periscope, and found a sign in Russian on the bank, saying be careful, underwater cables. It's rumored that when the Soviets learned of this, they went down and found the pods.

Dear author, try living without electricity or fresh water for a few days, then I'll ask you again... reply PaulDavisThe1st 16 hours agoparentI thought the same, but then, after a few pages, was this: > If, hypothetically, all these cables were to simultaneously break, modern civilization would cease to function. The financial system would immediately freeze. Currency trading would stop; stock exchanges would close. Banks and governments would be unable to move funds between countries because the Swift and US interbank systems both rely on submarine cables to settle over $10 trillion in transactions each day. In large swaths of the world, people would discover their credit cards no longer worked and ATMs would dispense no cash. As US Federal Reserve staff director Steve Malphrus said at a 2009 cable security conference, “When communications networks go down, the financial services sector does not grind to a halt. It snaps to a halt.” > Corporations would lose the ability to coordinate overseas manufacturing and logistics. Seemingly local institutions would be paralyzed as outsourced accounting, personnel, and customer service departments went dark. Governments, which rely on the same cables as everyone else for the vast majority of their communications, would be largely cut off from their overseas outposts and each other. Satellites would not be able to pick up even half a percent of the traffic. Contemplating the prospect of a mass cable cut to the UK, then-MP Rishi Sunak concluded, “Short of nuclear or biological warfare, it is difficult to think of a threat that could be more justifiably described as existential.” You could still argue with \"the world's most important\" claim, but this makes it clear that it is at least somewhat defensible. reply AnimalMuppet 15 hours agorootparentBut that's rather overstating the case, isn't it? If all these cables simultaneously break, we'd switch to Starlink (at much lower total bandwidth), and international communication would drop in volume, with the most valuable uses winning. Millisecond-level currency trading would cease, but second- or minute-level trading would continue, and that would not dramatically destroy economies. ATMs of foreign banks might stop working; local banks should continue. Watching video from a foreign server would no longer be possible, but that's not the end of the world. And so on. It would slow many things down, some things would stop, but it wouldn't be the end of modern civilization. reply PaulDavisThe1st 15 hours agorootparent> we'd switch to Starlink (at much lower total bandwidth) That's some kind of understatement, assuming that TFA is correct: > Satellites would not be able to pick up even half a percent of the traffic. I very much doubt that the trading systems that today rely on international data cables can be run via phones and voice communications, and I also wonder just how much of the phone system (even domestically within the USA) paradoxically relies in submarine cables. reply AnimalMuppet 15 hours agorootparent> Satellites would not be able to pick up even half a percent of the traffic. So? How much of that traffic is video? If you eliminate that, what percentage of the rest can satellite pick up? I was not proposing that trading systems run via phones and voice. No, those are much less bandwidth-efficient than data. I was proposing that they continue to be run by data, just with lower frequency.

Reprinted by kind permission of the Reagan Library. The picture of Ronald Reagan peering into a child’s messy bedroom—which I’m now realising, as I type, is mildly sinister?—is in fact, believe it or not, two photos mashed together1. Both are from Getty who I’m sure won’t mind. As one would expect, Ronald Reagan was the recipient of thousands of letters each month during his presidency; a mailbag so voluminous, in fact, that a gang of patient volunteers were tasked with opening them all on his behalf and passing him approximately 30 each week to read and respond to. Letters arrived from all over the world, written by a diverse group of people: men, women, fans, critics, average Joes, celebrities, world leaders, and, marking a moment in history, a letter from a 13-year-old boy from South Carolina named Andy Smith, written exactly 40 years ago on 18 April 1984. Andy Smith to U.S. President Ronald Reagan, 18th April 1984 Andy Smith 400 London Pride Road Irmo, South Carolina 29063 April 18, 1984 Dear Mr. President, My name is Andy Smith. I am a seventh grade student at Irmo Middle School, in Irmo, South Carolina. Today my mother declared my bedroom a disaster area. I would like to request federal funds to hire a crew to clean up my room. I am prepared to provide the initial funds if you will provide matching funds for this project. I know you will be fair when you consider my request. I will be awaiting your reply. Sincerely yours, Andy Smith May 11, 1984 Dear Andy: I’m sorry to be so late in answering your letter but, as you know, I’ve been in China and found your letter here upon my return. Your application for disaster relief has been duly noted but I must point out one technical problem: the authority declaring the disaster is supposed to make the request. In this case, your mother. However, setting that aside, I’ll have to point out the larger problem of available funds. This has been a year of disasters: 539 hurricanes as of May 4th and several more since, numerous floods, forest fires, drought in Texas and a number of earthquakes. What I’m getting at is that funds are dangerously low. May I make a suggestion? This Administration, believing that government has done many things that could better be done by volunteers at the local level, has sponsored a Private Sector Initiative Program, calling upon people to practice voluntarism in the solving of a number of local problems. Your situation appears to be a natural. I’m sure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you are in an excellent position to launch another volunteer program to go along with the more than 3000 already underway in our nation. Congratulations. Give my best regards to your mother. Sincerely, Ronald Reagan 1 Before you ask about my photo manipulation training: I’m self-taught.

The band members wrote back with a surprising frequency, and were extremely polite and grateful for fanmail. I remember that I had a fairly in-depth email session with Justin Pierre, the lead singer for Motion City Soundtrack, where I asked him about how he comes up with songs and what touring was like. Now, obviously, there's reasons that kids should absolutely not ever do this, because there's a lot of really crappy humans who might try and exploit the kids or do otherwise horrible things, but I was lucky enough to where that never happened to me, and everyone who wrote back to me was very professional and seemed flattered that anyone liked their music enough to write a fan email. I think email was still a new enough thing to where most people weren't writing fan emails. It's something I reminisce about occasionally, and while I don't really agree with any of Reagan's policies, I will acknowledge that him writing back to this kid was genuinely a kind of cool thing to do. ETA: Before anyone goes judging them, I should point out that my parents did not know I was doing that, and would likely have told me to stop if they did, precisely because they would have been afraid of me being coerced into something horrible as a minor. I don't think they realized at the time that it was even possible to directly contact band members via email. reply Zathman 7 hours agoparentI continue to reach out to at least one independent band or artist each year, even now in my mid-30s. Around the end of each year, I review my top artists and songs to see which truly resonated with me as part of my life's soundtrack. Whether through email, SoundCloud, Facebook, LinkedIn, or VK, I take the time to express my appreciation for their work—sharing which songs touched me and why. Amazingly, nearly every artist responds. One memorable instance was when an artist, who hadn’t produced music in over a decade and was going through a tough divorce, told me a year later that my message had inspired him to return to music and embrace life anew. Your engagement with musicians can have a profound impact, perhaps even inspiring them to rediscover their passion.

Risk for email is very low, especially when the child seeks out an adult, opposed to the other way around. Ironically, my elderly father does the same thing today! He cold emails ivy league professors and writers from the WSJ, and I'm always surprised on how engaged they get with corresponding. They send preprints, lab data, and all kinds of followup. reply mturmon 11 hours agorootparentIn the 90's I used to listen to Ian Masters' radio show Background Briefing which was a very pointy-headed, left-leaning examination of various issues. At the time it was just a show run by a very competent host out of a public radio station in LA (KPFK - not an NPR affiliate). I think it has expanded since then. Several times Ian said he was surprised to usually get a \"yes\" when he asked some relatively high-profile journalist, think-tanker, or university professor to be interviewed on his show. (Typical interview was 15-20 minutes of airtime - not just a sound bite.) Basically, these folks seem to be surprisingly willing to chat when cold-called by an interested person. reply mysterydip 11 hours agorootparentprevSimilarly I've done research on some of the more obscure older games, and cold emailing developers when I find contact info has resulted in a suprising number of successful correspondences. reply bigstrat2003 12 hours agoparentprevI don't think it's really that bad for kids to do this, nor for parents to let their kids do this.

Simenon used to write his novels in a week, and that isn't particularly unusual. It certainly varies with genre, and the short writing periods tend to be more common in genres where people write series and the genre has very specific expectations (e.g. romance, crime mysteries) and where huge levels of originality isn't needed. NOT suggesting that is the case for Tchaikovsky. I've written two novels, and when I first get myself to sit down and write (that's the hard part), I fairly consistently write 2k words an hour. A 200 page novel is in the 60k-65k word range, so 30-33 hours of writing. If I could get myself to sit down and just write more consistently, I could churn out a lot too (of course whether it'd be good enough and/or commercial enough is another matter - most authors sell peanuts). That ability to make themselves sit down and write with some degree of consistency is the most impressive part to me with authors who produce a lot, but that probably reflects what I personally find hardest (my second novel took three weeks from synopsis to first draft, and another four of editing; I'm now two years and 40k words into my third novel despite having planned the plot out in detail) reply autoexec 10 hours agorootparentprev> I was wondering if he was a real, individual human being because that author writes far more text in a short period of time than anybody I've ever seen.

A lot of people ask me “ok, what would you use instead”, and I just point them to the Go register ABI, but it seems most people have trouble filling in the gaps of what I mean. This article explains what I mean in detail. I have discussed calling conventions in the past, but as a reminder: the calling convention is the part of the ABI that concerns itself with how to pass arguments to and from a function, and how to actually call a function. This includes which registers arguments go in, which registers values are returned out of, what function prologues/epilogues look like, how unwinding works, etc. This particular post is primarily about x86, but I intend to be reasonably generic (so that what I’ve written applies just as well to ARM, RISC-V, etc). I will assume a general familiarity with x86 assembly, LLVM IR, and Rust (but not rustc’s internals). The Problem Today, like many other natively compiled languages, Rust defines an unspecified0- calling convention that lets it call functions however it likes. In practice, Rust lowers to LLVM’s built-in C calling convention, which LLVM’s prologue/epilogue codegen generates calls for. Rust is fairly conservative: it tries to generate LLVM function signatures that Clang could have plausibly generated. This has two significant benefits: Good probability debuggers won’t choke on it. This is not a concern on Linux, though, because DWARF is very general and does not bake-in the Linux C ABI. We will concern ourselves only with ELF-based systems and assume that debuggability is a nonissue. It is less likely to tickle LLVM bugs due to using ABI codegen that Clang does not exercise. I think that if Rust tickles LLVM bugs, we should actually fix them (a very small number of rustc contributors do in fact do this). However, we are too conservative. We get terrible codegen for simple functions: fn extract(arr: [i32; 3]) -> i32 { arr[1] } Rust extract: mov eax, dword ptr [rdi + 4] ret x86 Assembly arr is 12 bytes wide, so you’d think it would be passed in registers, but no! It is passed by pointer! Rust is actually more conservative than what the Linux C ABI mandates, because it actually passes the [i32; 3] in registers when extern \"C\" is requested. extern \"C\" fn extract(arr: [i32; 3]) -> i32 { arr[1] } Rust extract: mov rax, rdi shr rax, 32 ret x86 Assembly The array is passed in rdi and rsi, with the i32s packed into registers. The function moves rdi into rax, the output register, and shifts the upper half down. Not only does clang produce patently bad code for passing things by value, but it also knows how to do it better, if you request a standard calling convention! We could be generating way better code than Clang, but we don’t! Hereforth, I will describe how to do it. -Zcallconv Let’s suppose that we keep the current calling convention for extern \"Rust\"1, but we add a flag -Zcallconv that sets the calling convention for extern \"Rust\" when compiling a crate. The supported values will be -Zcallconv=legacy for the current one, and -Zcallconv=fast for the one we’re going to design. We could even let -O set -Zcallconv=fast automatically. Why keep the old calling convention? Although I did sweep debugability under the rug, one nice property -Zcallconv=fast will not have is that it does not place arguments in the C ABI order, which means that a reader replying on the “Diana’s silk dress cost $89” mnemonic on x86 will get fairly confused. I am also assuming we may not even support -Zcallconv=fast for some targets, like WASM, where there is no concept of “registers” and “spilling”. It may not even make sense to enable it for for debug builds, because it will produce much worse code with optimizations turned off. There is also a mild wrinkle with function pointers, and extern \"Rust\" {} blocks. Because this flag is per-crate, even though functions can advertise which version of extern \"Rust\" they use, function pointers have no such luxury. However, calling through a function pointer is slow and rare, so we can simply force them to use -Zcallconv=legacy. We can generate a shim to translate calling conventions as needed. Similarly, we can, in principle, call any Rust function like this: fn secret_call() -> i32 { extern \"Rust\" { fn my_func() -> i32; } unsafe { my_func() } } Rust However, this mechanism can only be used to call unmangled symbols. Thus, we can simply force #[no_mangle] symbols to use the legacy calling convention. Bending LLVM to Our Will In an ideal world, LLVM would provide a way for us to specify the calling convention directly. E.g., this argument goes in that register, this return goes in that one, etc. Unfortunately, adding a calling convention to LLVM requires writing a bunch of C++. However, we can get away with specifying our own calling convention by following the following procedure. First, determine, for a given target triple, the maximum number of values that can be passed “by register”. I will explain how to do this below. Decide how to pass the return value. It will either fit in the output registers, or it will need to be returned “by reference”, in which case we pass an extra ptr argument to the function (tagged with the sret attribute) and the actual return value of the function is that pointer. Decide which arguments that have been passed by value need to be demoted to being passed by reference. This will be a heuristic, but generally will be approximately “arguments larger than the by-register space”. For example, on x86, this comes out to 176 bytes. Decide which arguments get passed by register, so as to maximize register space usage. This problem is NP-hard (it’s the knapsack problem) so it will require a heuristic. All other arguments are passed on the stack. Generate the function signature in LLVM IR. This will be all of the arguments that are passed by register encoded as various non-aggregates, such as i64, ptr, double, and . What valid choices are for said non-aggregates depends on the target, but the above are what you will generally get on a 64-bit architecture. Arguments passed on the stack will follow the “register inputs”. Generate a function prologue. This is code to decode each Rust-level argument from the register inputs, so that there are %ssa values corresponding to those that would be present when using -Zcallconv=legacy. This allows us to generate the same code for the body of the function regardless of calling convention. Redundant decoding code will be eliminated by DCE passes. Generate a function exit block. This is a block that contains a single phi instruction for the return type as it would be for -Zcallconv=legacy. This block will encode it into the requisite output format and then ret as appropriate. All exit paths through the function should br to this block instead of ret-ing. If a non-polymorphic, non-inline function may have its address taken (as a function pointer), either because it is exported out of the crate or the crate takes a function pointer to it, generate a shim that uses -Zcallconv=legacy and immediately tail-calls the real implementation. This is necessary to preserve function pointer equality. The main upshot here is that we need to cook up heuristics for figuring out what goes in registers (since we allow reordering arguments to get better throughput). This is equivalent to the knapsack problem; knapsack heuristics are beyond the scope of this article. This should happen early enough that this information can be stuffed into rmeta to avoid needing to recompute it. We may want to use different, faster heuristics depending on -Copt-level. Note that correctness requires that we forbid linking code generated by multiple different Rust compilers, which is already the case, since Rust breaks ABI from release to release. What Is LLVM Willing to Do? Assuming we do that, how do we actually get LLVM to pass things in the way we want it to? We need to determine what the largest “by register” passing LLVM will permit is. The following LLVM program is useful for determining this on a particular version of LLVM: %InputI = type [6 x i64] %InputF = type [0 x double] %InputV = type [8 x ] %OutputI = type [3 x i64] %OutputF = type [0 x double] %OutputV = type [4 x ] define void @inputs({ %InputI, %InputF, %InputV }) { %p = alloca [4096 x i8] store volatile { %InputI, %InputF, %InputV } %0, ptr %p ret void } %Output = { %OutputI, %OutputF, %OutputV } @gOutput = constant %Output zeroinitializer define %Output @outputs() { %1 = load %Output, ptr @gOutput ret %Output %1 } LLVM IR When you pass an aggregate by-value to an LLVM function, LLVM will attempt to “explode” that aggregate into as many registers as possible. There are distinct register classes on different systems. For example, on both x86 and ARM, floats and vectors share the same register class (kind of2). The above values are for x863. LLVM will pass six integers and eight SSE vectors by register, and return half as many (3 and 4) by register. Increasing any of the values generates extra loads and stores that indicate LLVM gave up and passed arguments on the stack. The values for aarch64-unknown-linux are 8 integers and 8 vectors for both inputs and outputs, respectively. This is the maximum number of registers we get to play with for each class. Anything extra gets passed on the stack. I recommend that every function have the same number of by-register arguments. So on x86, EVERY -Zcallconv=fast function’s signature should look like this: declare {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} @my_func( i64 %rdi, i64 %rsi, i64 %rdx, i64 %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1,%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7, ; other args... ) LLVM IR When passing pointers, the appropriate i64s should be replaced by ptr, and when passing doubles, they replace s. But you’re probably saying, “Miguel, that’s crazy! Most functions don’t pass 176 bytes!” And you’d be right, if not for the magic of LLVM’s very well-specified poison semantics. We can get away with not doing extra work if every argument we do not use is passed poison. Because poison is equal to “the most convenient possible value at the present moment”, when LLVM sees poison passed into a function via register, it decides that the most convenient value is “whatever happens to be in the register already”, and so it doesn’t have to touch that register! For example, if we wanted to pass a pointer via rcx, we would generate the following code. ; This is a -Zcallconv=fast-style function. %Out = type {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} define %Out @load_rcx( i64 %rdi, i64 %rsi, i64 %rdx, ptr %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1,%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7 ) { %load = load i64, ptr %rcx %out = insertvalue %Out poison, i64 %load, 0, 0 ret %Out %out } declare ptr @malloc(i64) define i64 @make_the_call() { %1 = call ptr @malloc(i64 8) store i64 42, ptr %1 %2 = call %Out @by_rcx( i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 poison, ptr %1, i64 poison, i64 poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison) %3 = extractvalue %Out %2, 0, 0 %4 = add i64 %3, 42 ret i64 %4 } LLVM IR by_rcx: mov rax, qword ptr [rcx] ret make_the_call: push rax mov edi, 8 call malloc mov qword ptr [rax], 42 mov rcx, rax call load_rcx add rax, 42 pop rcx ret x86 Assembly It is perfectly legal to pass poison to a function, if it does not interact with the poisoned argument in any proscribed way. And as we see, load_rcx() receives its pointer argument in rcx, whereas make_the_call() takes no penalty in setting up the call: loading poison into the other thirteen registers compiles down to nothing4, so it only needs to load the pointer returned by malloc into rcx. This gives us almost total control over argument passing; unfortunately, it is not total. In an ideal world, the same registers are used for input and output, to allow easier pipelining of calls without introducing extra register traffic. This is true on ARM and RISC-V, but not x86. However, because register ordering is merely a suggestion for us, we can choose to allocate the return registers in whatever order we want. For example, we can pretend the order registers should be allocated in is rdx, rcx, rdi, rsi, r8, r9 for inputs, and rdx, rcx, rax for outputs. %Out = type {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} define %Out @square( i64 %rdi, i64 %rsi, i64 %rdx, ptr %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1,%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7 ) { %sq = mul i64 %rdx, %rdx %out = insertvalue %Out poison, i64 %sq, 0, 1 ret %Out %out } define i64 @make_the_call(i64) { %2 = call %Out @square( i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 %0, i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison) %3 = extractvalue %Out %2, 0, 1 %4 = call %Out @square( i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 %3, i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison) %5 = extractvalue %Out %4, 0, 1 ret i64 %5 } LLVM IR square: imul rdx, rdx ret make_the_call: push rax mov rdx, rdi call square call square mov rax, rdx pop rcx ret x86 Assembly square generates extremely simple code: the input and output register is rdi, so no extra register traffic needs to be generated. Similarly, when we effectively do @square(@square(%0)), there is no setup between the functions. This is similar to code seen on aarch64, which uses the same register sequence for input and output. We can see that the “naive” version of this IR produces the exact same code on aarch64 for this reason. define i64 @square(i64) { %2 = mul i64 %0, %0 ret i64 %2 } define i64 @make_the_call(i64) { %2 = call i64 @square(i64 %0) %3 = call i64 @square(i64 %2) ret i64 %3 } LLVM IR square: mul x0, x0, x0 ret make_the_call: str x30, [sp, #-16]! bl square ldr x30, [sp], #16 b square // Tail call. ARM Assembly Rust Structs and Unions Now that we’ve established total control on how registers are assigned, we can turn towards maximizing use of these registers in Rust. For simplicity, we can assume that rustc has already processed the users’s types into basic aggregates and unions; no enums here! We then have to make some decisions about which portions of the arguments to allocate to registers. First, return values. This is relatively straightforward, since there is only one value to pass. The amount of data we need to return is not the size of the struct. For example, [(u64, u32); 2] measures 32 bytes wide. However, eight of those bytes are padding! We do not need to preserve padding when returning by value, so we can flatten the struct into (u64, u32, u64, u32) and sort by size into (u64, u64, u32, u32). This has no padding and is 24 bytes wide, which fits into the three return registers LLVM gives us on x86. We define the effective size of a type to be the number of non-undef bits it occupies. For [(u64, u32); 2], this is 192 bits, since it excludes the padding. For bool, this is one. For char this is technically 21, but it’s simpler to treat char as an alias for u32. The reason for counting bits this way is that it permits significant compaction. For example, returning a struct full of bools can simply bit-pack the bools into a single register. So, a return value is converted to a by-ref return if its effective size is smaller than the output register space (on x86, this is three integer registers and four SSE registers, so we get 88 bytes total, or 704 bits). Argument registers are much harder, because we hit the knapsack problem, which is NP-hard. The following relatively naive heuristic is where I would start, but it can be made infinitely smarter over time. First, demote to by-ref any argument whose effective size is larget than the total by-register input space (on x86, 176 bytes or 1408 bits). This means we get a pointer argument instead. This is beneficial to do first, since a single pointer might pack better than the huge struct. Enums should be replaced by the appropriate discriminant-union pair. For example, Option is, internally, (union { i32, () }, i1), while Option> is (union { i32, (), () }, i2). Using a small non-power-of-two integer improves our ability to pack things, since enum discriminants are often quite tiny. Next, we need to handle unions. Because mucking about with unions’ uninitialized bits behind our backs is allowed, we need to either pass it as an array of u8, unless it only has a single non-empty variant, in which case it is replaced with that variant5. Now, we can proceed to flatten everything. All of the converted arguments are flattened into their most primitive components: pointers, integers, floats, and bools. Every field should be no larger than the smallest argument register; this may require splitting large types such as u128 or f64. This big list of primitives is next sorted by effective size, from smallest to largest. We take the largest prefix of this that will fit in the available register space; everything else goes on the stack. If part of a Rust-level input is sent to the stack in this way, and that part is larger than a small multiple of the pointer size (e.g., 2x), it is demoted to being passed by pointer-on-the-stack, to minimize memory traffic. Everything else is passed directly on the stack in the order those inputs were before the sort. This helps keep regions that need to be copied relatively contiguous, to minimize calls to memcpy. The things we choose to pass in registers are allocated to registers in reverse size order, so e.g. first 64-bit things, then 32-bit things, etc. This is the same layout algorithm that repr(Rust) structs use to move all the padding into the tail. Once we get to the bools, those are bit-packed, 64 to a register. Here’s a relatively complicated example. My Rust function is as follows: struct Options { colorize: bool, verbose_debug: bool, allow_spurious_failure: bool, retries: u32, } trait Context { fn check(&self, n: usize, colorize: bool); } fn do_thing(op_count: Option, context: &dyn Context, name: &'a str, code: [char; 6], options: Options, ) -> &'a str { if let Some(op_count) = op_count { context.check(op_count, options.colorize); } for c in code { if let Some((_, suf)) = name.split_once(c) { return suf; } } \"idk\" } Rust The codegen for this function is quite complex, so I’ll only cover the prologue and epilogue. After sorting and flattening, our raw argument LLVM types are something like this: gprs: i64, ptr, ptr, ptr, i64, i32, i32 xmm0: i32, i32, i32, i32 xmm1: i32, i1, i1, i1, i1 LLVM IR Everything fits in registers! So, what does the LLVM function look like on x86? %Out = type {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} define %Out @do_thing( i64 %rdi, ptr %rsi, ptr %rdx, ptr %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1, ; Unused.%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7 ) { ; First, unpack all the primitives. %r9.0 = trunc i64 %r9 to i32 %r9.1.i64 = lshr i64 %r9, 32 %r9.1 = trunc i64 %r9.1.i64 to i32 %xmm0.0 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 0 %xmm0.1 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 1 %xmm0.2 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 2 %xmm0.3 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 3 %xmm1.0 = extractelement%xmm1, i32 0 %xmm1.1 = extractelement%xmm1, i32 1 %xmm1.1.0 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1 to i1 %xmm1.1.1.i32 = lshr i32 %xmm1.1, 1 %xmm1.1.1 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1.1.i32 to i1 %xmm1.1.2.i32 = lshr i32 %xmm1.1, 2 %xmm1.1.2 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1.2.i32 to i1 %xmm1.1.3.i32 = lshr i32 %xmm1.1, 3 %xmm1.1.3 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1.3.i32 to i1 ; Next, reassemble them into concrete values as needed. %op_count.0 = insertvalue { i64, i1 } poison, i64 %rdi, 0 %op_count = insertvalue { i64, i1 } %op_count.0, i1 %xmm1.1.0, 1 %context.0 = insertvalue { ptr, ptr } poison, ptr %rsi, 0 %context = insertvalue { ptr, ptr } %context.0, ptr %rdx, 1 %name.0 = insertvalue { ptr, i64 } poison, ptr %rcx, 0 %name = insertvalue { ptr, i64 } %name.0, i64 %r8, 1 %code.0 = insertvalue [6 x i32] poison, i32 %r9.0, 0 %code.1 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.0, i32 %r9.1, 1 %code.2 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.1, i32 %xmm0.0, 2 %code.3 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.2, i32 %xmm0.1, 3 %code.4 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.3, i32 %xmm0.2, 4 %code = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.4, i32 %xmm0.3, 5 %options.0 = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } poison, i32 %xmm1.0, 0 %options.1 = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } %options.0, i1 %xmm1.1.1, 1 %options.2 = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } %options.1, i1 %xmm1.1.2, 2 %options = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } %options.2, i1 %xmm1.1.3, 3 ; Codegen as usual. ; ... } LLVM IR Above, !dbg metadata for the argument values should be attached to the instruction that actually materializes it. This ensures that gdb does something halfway intelligent when you ask it to print argument values. On the other hand, in current rustc, it gives LLVM eight pointer-sized parameters, so it winds up spending all six integer registers, plus two values passed on the stack. Not great! This is not a complete description of what a completely over-engineered calling convention could entail: in some cases we might know that we have additional registers available (such as AVX registers on x86). There are cases where we might want to split a struct across registers and the stack. This also isn’t even getting into what returns could look like. Results are often passed through several layers of functions via ?, which can result in a lot of redundant register moves. Often, a Result is large enough that it doesn’t fit in registers, so each call in the ? stack has to inspect an ok bit by loading it from memory. Instead, a Result return might be implemented as an out-parameter pointer for the error, with the ok variant’s payload, and the is ok bit, returned as an Option. There are some fussy details with Into calls via ?, but the idea is implementable. Optimization-Dependent ABI Now, because we’re Rust, we’ve also got a trick up our sleeve that C doesn’t (but Go does)! When we’re generating the ABI that all callers will see (for -Zcallconv=fast), we can look at the function body. This means that a crate can advertise the precise ABI (in terms of register-passing) of its functions. This opens the door to a more extreme optimization-based ABIs. We can start by simply throwing out unused arguments: if the function never does anything with a parameter, don’t bother spending registers on it. Another example: suppose that we know that an &T argument is not retained (a question the borrow checker can answer at this point in the compiler) and is never converted to a raw pointer (or written to memory a raw pointer is taken of, etc). We also know that T is fairly small, and T: Freeze. Then, we can replace the reference with the pointee directly, passed by value. The most obvious candidates for this is APIs like HashMap::get(). If the key is something like an i32, we need to spill that integer to the stack and pass a pointer to it! This results in unnecessary, avoidable memory traffic. Profile-guided ABI is a step further. We might know that some arguments are hotter than others, which might cause them to be prioritized in the register allocation order. You could even imagine a case where a function takes a very large struct by reference, but three i64 fields are very hot, so the caller can preload those fields, passing them both by register and via the pointer to the large struct. The callee does not see additional cost: it had to issue those loads anyway. However, the caller probably has those values in registers already, which avoids some memory traffic. Instrumentation profiles may even indicate that it makes sense to duplicate whole functions, which are identical except for their ABIs. Maybe they take different arguments by register to avoid costly spills. Conclusion This is a bit more advanced (and ranty) than my usual writing, but this is an aspect of Rust that I find really frustrating. We could be doing so much better than C++ ever can (because of their ABI constraints). None of this is new ideas; this is literally how Go does it! So why don’t we? Part of the reason is that ABI codegen is complex, and as I described above, LLVM gives us very few useful knobs. It’s not a friendly part of rustc, and doing things wrong can have nasty consequences for usability. The other part is a lack of expertise. As of writing, only a handful of people contributing to rustc have the necessary grasp of LLVM’s semantics (and mood swings) to emit the Right Code such that we get good codegen and don’t crash LLVM. Another reason is compilation time. The more complicated the function signatures, the more prologue/epilogue code we have to generate that LLVM has to chew on. But -Zcallconv is intended to only be used with optimizations turned on, so I don’t think this is a meaningful complaint. Nor do I think the project’s Goodhartization of compilation time as a metric is healthy… but I do not think this is ultimately a relevant drawback. I, unfortunately, do not have the spare time to dive into fixing rustc’s ABI code, but I do know LLVM really well, and I know that this is a place where Rust has a low bus factor. For that reason, I am happy to provide the Rust compiler team expert knowledge on getting LLVM to do the right thing in service of making optimized code faster. Or just switch it to the codepath for extern \"C\" or extern \"fastcall\" since those are clearly better. We will always need to know how to generate code for the non-extern \"Rust\" calling conventions. ↩ It’s Complicated. Passing a double burns a wholeslot. This seems bad, but it can be beneficial since keeping a double in vector registers reduces register traffic, since usually, fp instructions use the vector registers (or the fp registers shadow the vector registers, like on ARM). ↩ On the one hand, you might say this “extended calling convention” isn’t an explicitly supported part of LLVM’s ccc calling convention. On the other hand, Hyrum’s Law cuts both ways: Rust is big enough of an LLVM user that LLVM cannot simply miscompile all Rust programs at this point, and the IR I propose Rust emits is extremely reasonable. If Rust causes LLVM to misbehave, that’s an LLVM bug, and we should fix LLVM bugs, not work around them. ↩ Only on -O1 or higher, bizarrely. At -O0, LLVM decides that all of the poisons must have the same value, so it copies a bunch of registers around needlessly. This seems like a bug? ↩ There are other cases where we might want to replace a union with one of its variants: for example, there’s a lot of cases where Result is secretly a union { ptr, u32 }, in which case it should be replaced with a single ptr. ↩ Related Posts 2023-11-27 / Designing a SIMD Algorithm from Scratch 2023-09-29 / What is a Matrix?

A lot of people ask me “ok, what would you use instead”, and I just point them to the Go register ABI, but it seems most people have trouble filling in the gaps of what I mean. This article explains what I mean in detail. I have discussed calling conventions in the past, but as a reminder: the calling convention is the part of the ABI that concerns itself with how to pass arguments to and from a function, and how to actually call a function. This includes which registers arguments go in, which registers values are returned out of, what function prologues/epilogues look like, how unwinding works, etc. This particular post is primarily about x86, but I intend to be reasonably generic (so that what I’ve written applies just as well to ARM, RISC-V, etc). I will assume a general familiarity with x86 assembly, LLVM IR, and Rust (but not rustc’s internals). The Problem Today, like many other natively compiled languages, Rust defines an unspecified0- calling convention that lets it call functions however it likes. In practice, Rust lowers to LLVM’s built-in C calling convention, which LLVM’s prologue/epilogue codegen generates calls for. Rust is fairly conservative: it tries to generate LLVM function signatures that Clang could have plausibly generated. This has two significant benefits: Good probability debuggers won’t choke on it. This is not a concern on Linux, though, because DWARF is very general and does not bake-in the Linux C ABI. We will concern ourselves only with ELF-based systems and assume that debuggability is a nonissue. It is less likely to tickle LLVM bugs due to using ABI codegen that Clang does not exercise. I think that if Rust tickles LLVM bugs, we should actually fix them (a very small number of rustc contributors do in fact do this). However, we are too conservative. We get terrible codegen for simple functions: fn extract(arr: [i32; 3]) -> i32 { arr[1] } Rust extract: mov eax, dword ptr [rdi + 4] ret x86 Assembly arr is 12 bytes wide, so you’d think it would be passed in registers, but no! It is passed by pointer! Rust is actually more conservative than what the Linux C ABI mandates, because it actually passes the [i32; 3] in registers when extern \"C\" is requested. extern \"C\" fn extract(arr: [i32; 3]) -> i32 { arr[1] } Rust extract: mov rax, rdi shr rax, 32 ret x86 Assembly The array is passed in rdi and rsi, with the i32s packed into registers. The function moves rdi into rax, the output register, and shifts the upper half down. Not only does clang produce patently bad code for passing things by value, but it also knows how to do it better, if you request a standard calling convention! We could be generating way better code than Clang, but we don’t! Hereforth, I will describe how to do it. -Zcallconv Let’s suppose that we keep the current calling convention for extern \"Rust\"1, but we add a flag -Zcallconv that sets the calling convention for extern \"Rust\" when compiling a crate. The supported values will be -Zcallconv=legacy for the current one, and -Zcallconv=fast for the one we’re going to design. We could even let -O set -Zcallconv=fast automatically. Why keep the old calling convention? Although I did sweep debugability under the rug, one nice property -Zcallconv=fast will not have is that it does not place arguments in the C ABI order, which means that a reader replying on the “Diana’s silk dress cost $89” mnemonic on x86 will get fairly confused. I am also assuming we may not even support -Zcallconv=fast for some targets, like WASM, where there is no concept of “registers” and “spilling”. It may not even make sense to enable it for for debug builds, because it will produce much worse code with optimizations turned off. There is also a mild wrinkle with function pointers, and extern \"Rust\" {} blocks. Because this flag is per-crate, even though functions can advertise which version of extern \"Rust\" they use, function pointers have no such luxury. However, calling through a function pointer is slow and rare, so we can simply force them to use -Zcallconv=legacy. We can generate a shim to translate calling conventions as needed. Similarly, we can, in principle, call any Rust function like this: fn secret_call() -> i32 { extern \"Rust\" { fn my_func() -> i32; } unsafe { my_func() } } Rust However, this mechanism can only be used to call unmangled symbols. Thus, we can simply force #[no_mangle] symbols to use the legacy calling convention. Bending LLVM to Our Will In an ideal world, LLVM would provide a way for us to specify the calling convention directly. E.g., this argument goes in that register, this return goes in that one, etc. Unfortunately, adding a calling convention to LLVM requires writing a bunch of C++. However, we can get away with specifying our own calling convention by following the following procedure. First, determine, for a given target triple, the maximum number of values that can be passed “by register”. I will explain how to do this below. Decide how to pass the return value. It will either fit in the output registers, or it will need to be returned “by reference”, in which case we pass an extra ptr argument to the function (tagged with the sret attribute) and the actual return value of the function is that pointer. Decide which arguments that have been passed by value need to be demoted to being passed by reference. This will be a heuristic, but generally will be approximately “arguments larger than the by-register space”. For example, on x86, this comes out to 176 bytes. Decide which arguments get passed by register, so as to maximize register space usage. This problem is NP-hard (it’s the knapsack problem) so it will require a heuristic. All other arguments are passed on the stack. Generate the function signature in LLVM IR. This will be all of the arguments that are passed by register encoded as various non-aggregates, such as i64, ptr, double, and . What valid choices are for said non-aggregates depends on the target, but the above are what you will generally get on a 64-bit architecture. Arguments passed on the stack will follow the “register inputs”. Generate a function prologue. This is code to decode each Rust-level argument from the register inputs, so that there are %ssa values corresponding to those that would be present when using -Zcallconv=legacy. This allows us to generate the same code for the body of the function regardless of calling convention. Redundant decoding code will be eliminated by DCE passes. Generate a function exit block. This is a block that contains a single phi instruction for the return type as it would be for -Zcallconv=legacy. This block will encode it into the requisite output format and then ret as appropriate. All exit paths through the function should br to this block instead of ret-ing. If a non-polymorphic, non-inline function may have its address taken (as a function pointer), either because it is exported out of the crate or the crate takes a function pointer to it, generate a shim that uses -Zcallconv=legacy and immediately tail-calls the real implementation. This is necessary to preserve function pointer equality. The main upshot here is that we need to cook up heuristics for figuring out what goes in registers (since we allow reordering arguments to get better throughput). This is equivalent to the knapsack problem; knapsack heuristics are beyond the scope of this article. This should happen early enough that this information can be stuffed into rmeta to avoid needing to recompute it. We may want to use different, faster heuristics depending on -Copt-level. Note that correctness requires that we forbid linking code generated by multiple different Rust compilers, which is already the case, since Rust breaks ABI from release to release. What Is LLVM Willing to Do? Assuming we do that, how do we actually get LLVM to pass things in the way we want it to? We need to determine what the largest “by register” passing LLVM will permit is. The following LLVM program is useful for determining this on a particular version of LLVM: %InputI = type [6 x i64] %InputF = type [0 x double] %InputV = type [8 x ] %OutputI = type [3 x i64] %OutputF = type [0 x double] %OutputV = type [4 x ] define void @inputs({ %InputI, %InputF, %InputV }) { %p = alloca [4096 x i8] store volatile { %InputI, %InputF, %InputV } %0, ptr %p ret void } %Output = { %OutputI, %OutputF, %OutputV } @gOutput = constant %Output zeroinitializer define %Output @outputs() { %1 = load %Output, ptr @gOutput ret %Output %1 } LLVM IR When you pass an aggregate by-value to an LLVM function, LLVM will attempt to “explode” that aggregate into as many registers as possible. There are distinct register classes on different systems. For example, on both x86 and ARM, floats and vectors share the same register class (kind of2). The above values are for x863. LLVM will pass six integers and eight SSE vectors by register, and return half as many (3 and 4) by register. Increasing any of the values generates extra loads and stores that indicate LLVM gave up and passed arguments on the stack. The values for aarch64-unknown-linux are 8 integers and 8 vectors for both inputs and outputs, respectively. This is the maximum number of registers we get to play with for each class. Anything extra gets passed on the stack. I recommend that every function have the same number of by-register arguments. So on x86, EVERY -Zcallconv=fast function’s signature should look like this: declare {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} @my_func( i64 %rdi, i64 %rsi, i64 %rdx, i64 %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1,%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7, ; other args... ) LLVM IR When passing pointers, the appropriate i64s should be replaced by ptr, and when passing doubles, they replace s. But you’re probably saying, “Miguel, that’s crazy! Most functions don’t pass 176 bytes!” And you’d be right, if not for the magic of LLVM’s very well-specified poison semantics. We can get away with not doing extra work if every argument we do not use is passed poison. Because poison is equal to “the most convenient possible value at the present moment”, when LLVM sees poison passed into a function via register, it decides that the most convenient value is “whatever happens to be in the register already”, and so it doesn’t have to touch that register! For example, if we wanted to pass a pointer via rcx, we would generate the following code. ; This is a -Zcallconv=fast-style function. %Out = type {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} define %Out @load_rcx( i64 %rdi, i64 %rsi, i64 %rdx, ptr %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1,%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7 ) { %load = load i64, ptr %rcx %out = insertvalue %Out poison, i64 %load, 0, 0 ret %Out %out } declare ptr @malloc(i64) define i64 @make_the_call() { %1 = call ptr @malloc(i64 8) store i64 42, ptr %1 %2 = call %Out @by_rcx( i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 poison, ptr %1, i64 poison, i64 poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison) %3 = extractvalue %Out %2, 0, 0 %4 = add i64 %3, 42 ret i64 %4 } LLVM IR by_rcx: mov rax, qword ptr [rcx] ret make_the_call: push rax mov edi, 8 call malloc mov qword ptr [rax], 42 mov rcx, rax call load_rcx add rax, 42 pop rcx ret x86 Assembly It is perfectly legal to pass poison to a function, if it does not interact with the poisoned argument in any proscribed way. And as we see, load_rcx() receives its pointer argument in rcx, whereas make_the_call() takes no penalty in setting up the call: loading poison into the other thirteen registers compiles down to nothing4, so it only needs to load the pointer returned by malloc into rcx. This gives us almost total control over argument passing; unfortunately, it is not total. In an ideal world, the same registers are used for input and output, to allow easier pipelining of calls without introducing extra register traffic. This is true on ARM and RISC-V, but not x86. However, because register ordering is merely a suggestion for us, we can choose to allocate the return registers in whatever order we want. For example, we can pretend the order registers should be allocated in is rdx, rcx, rdi, rsi, r8, r9 for inputs, and rdx, rcx, rax for outputs. %Out = type {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} define %Out @square( i64 %rdi, i64 %rsi, i64 %rdx, ptr %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1,%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7 ) { %sq = mul i64 %rdx, %rdx %out = insertvalue %Out poison, i64 %sq, 0, 1 ret %Out %out } define i64 @make_the_call(i64) { %2 = call %Out @square( i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 %0, i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison) %3 = extractvalue %Out %2, 0, 1 %4 = call %Out @square( i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 %3, i64 poison, i64 poison, i64 poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison,poison) %5 = extractvalue %Out %4, 0, 1 ret i64 %5 } LLVM IR square: imul rdx, rdx ret make_the_call: push rax mov rdx, rdi call square call square mov rax, rdx pop rcx ret x86 Assembly square generates extremely simple code: the input and output register is rdi, so no extra register traffic needs to be generated. Similarly, when we effectively do @square(@square(%0)), there is no setup between the functions. This is similar to code seen on aarch64, which uses the same register sequence for input and output. We can see that the “naive” version of this IR produces the exact same code on aarch64 for this reason. define i64 @square(i64) { %2 = mul i64 %0, %0 ret i64 %2 } define i64 @make_the_call(i64) { %2 = call i64 @square(i64 %0) %3 = call i64 @square(i64 %2) ret i64 %3 } LLVM IR square: mul x0, x0, x0 ret make_the_call: str x30, [sp, #-16]! bl square ldr x30, [sp], #16 b square // Tail call. ARM Assembly Rust Structs and Unions Now that we’ve established total control on how registers are assigned, we can turn towards maximizing use of these registers in Rust. For simplicity, we can assume that rustc has already processed the users’s types into basic aggregates and unions; no enums here! We then have to make some decisions about which portions of the arguments to allocate to registers. First, return values. This is relatively straightforward, since there is only one value to pass. The amount of data we need to return is not the size of the struct. For example, [(u64, u32); 2] measures 32 bytes wide. However, eight of those bytes are padding! We do not need to preserve padding when returning by value, so we can flatten the struct into (u64, u32, u64, u32) and sort by size into (u64, u64, u32, u32). This has no padding and is 24 bytes wide, which fits into the three return registers LLVM gives us on x86. We define the effective size of a type to be the number of non-undef bits it occupies. For [(u64, u32); 2], this is 192 bits, since it excludes the padding. For bool, this is one. For char this is technically 21, but it’s simpler to treat char as an alias for u32. The reason for counting bits this way is that it permits significant compaction. For example, returning a struct full of bools can simply bit-pack the bools into a single register. So, a return value is converted to a by-ref return if its effective size is smaller than the output register space (on x86, this is three integer registers and four SSE registers, so we get 88 bytes total, or 704 bits). Argument registers are much harder, because we hit the knapsack problem, which is NP-hard. The following relatively naive heuristic is where I would start, but it can be made infinitely smarter over time. First, demote to by-ref any argument whose effective size is larget than the total by-register input space (on x86, 176 bytes or 1408 bits). This means we get a pointer argument instead. This is beneficial to do first, since a single pointer might pack better than the huge struct. Enums should be replaced by the appropriate discriminant-union pair. For example, Option is, internally, (union { i32, () }, i1), while Option> is (union { i32, (), () }, i2). Using a small non-power-of-two integer improves our ability to pack things, since enum discriminants are often quite tiny. Next, we need to handle unions. Because mucking about with unions’ uninitialized bits behind our backs is allowed, we need to either pass it as an array of u8, unless it only has a single non-empty variant, in which case it is replaced with that variant5. Now, we can proceed to flatten everything. All of the converted arguments are flattened into their most primitive components: pointers, integers, floats, and bools. Every field should be no larger than the smallest argument register; this may require splitting large types such as u128 or f64. This big list of primitives is next sorted by effective size, from smallest to largest. We take the largest prefix of this that will fit in the available register space; everything else goes on the stack. If part of a Rust-level input is sent to the stack in this way, and that part is larger than a small multiple of the pointer size (e.g., 2x), it is demoted to being passed by pointer-on-the-stack, to minimize memory traffic. Everything else is passed directly on the stack in the order those inputs were before the sort. This helps keep regions that need to be copied relatively contiguous, to minimize calls to memcpy. The things we choose to pass in registers are allocated to registers in reverse size order, so e.g. first 64-bit things, then 32-bit things, etc. This is the same layout algorithm that repr(Rust) structs use to move all the padding into the tail. Once we get to the bools, those are bit-packed, 64 to a register. Here’s a relatively complicated example. My Rust function is as follows: struct Options { colorize: bool, verbose_debug: bool, allow_spurious_failure: bool, retries: u32, } trait Context { fn check(&self, n: usize, colorize: bool); } fn do_thing(op_count: Option, context: &dyn Context, name: &'a str, code: [char; 6], options: Options, ) -> &'a str { if let Some(op_count) = op_count { context.check(op_count, options.colorize); } for c in code { if let Some((_, suf)) = name.split_once(c) { return suf; } } \"idk\" } Rust The codegen for this function is quite complex, so I’ll only cover the prologue and epilogue. After sorting and flattening, our raw argument LLVM types are something like this: gprs: i64, ptr, ptr, ptr, i64, i32, i32 xmm0: i32, i32, i32, i32 xmm1: i32, i1, i1, i1, i1 LLVM IR Everything fits in registers! So, what does the LLVM function look like on x86? %Out = type {[3 x i64], [4 x ]} define %Out @do_thing( i64 %rdi, ptr %rsi, ptr %rdx, ptr %rcx, i64 %r8, i64 %r9,%xmm0,%xmm1, ; Unused.%xmm2,%xmm3,%xmm4,%xmm5,%xmm6,%xmm7 ) { ; First, unpack all the primitives. %r9.0 = trunc i64 %r9 to i32 %r9.1.i64 = lshr i64 %r9, 32 %r9.1 = trunc i64 %r9.1.i64 to i32 %xmm0.0 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 0 %xmm0.1 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 1 %xmm0.2 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 2 %xmm0.3 = extractelement%xmm0, i32 3 %xmm1.0 = extractelement%xmm1, i32 0 %xmm1.1 = extractelement%xmm1, i32 1 %xmm1.1.0 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1 to i1 %xmm1.1.1.i32 = lshr i32 %xmm1.1, 1 %xmm1.1.1 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1.1.i32 to i1 %xmm1.1.2.i32 = lshr i32 %xmm1.1, 2 %xmm1.1.2 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1.2.i32 to i1 %xmm1.1.3.i32 = lshr i32 %xmm1.1, 3 %xmm1.1.3 = trunc i32 %xmm1.1.3.i32 to i1 ; Next, reassemble them into concrete values as needed. %op_count.0 = insertvalue { i64, i1 } poison, i64 %rdi, 0 %op_count = insertvalue { i64, i1 } %op_count.0, i1 %xmm1.1.0, 1 %context.0 = insertvalue { ptr, ptr } poison, ptr %rsi, 0 %context = insertvalue { ptr, ptr } %context.0, ptr %rdx, 1 %name.0 = insertvalue { ptr, i64 } poison, ptr %rcx, 0 %name = insertvalue { ptr, i64 } %name.0, i64 %r8, 1 %code.0 = insertvalue [6 x i32] poison, i32 %r9.0, 0 %code.1 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.0, i32 %r9.1, 1 %code.2 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.1, i32 %xmm0.0, 2 %code.3 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.2, i32 %xmm0.1, 3 %code.4 = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.3, i32 %xmm0.2, 4 %code = insertvalue [6 x i32] %code.4, i32 %xmm0.3, 5 %options.0 = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } poison, i32 %xmm1.0, 0 %options.1 = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } %options.0, i1 %xmm1.1.1, 1 %options.2 = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } %options.1, i1 %xmm1.1.2, 2 %options = insertvalue { i32, i1, i1, i1 } %options.2, i1 %xmm1.1.3, 3 ; Codegen as usual. ; ... } LLVM IR Above, !dbg metadata for the argument values should be attached to the instruction that actually materializes it. This ensures that gdb does something halfway intelligent when you ask it to print argument values. On the other hand, in current rustc, it gives LLVM eight pointer-sized parameters, so it winds up spending all six integer registers, plus two values passed on the stack. Not great! This is not a complete description of what a completely over-engineered calling convention could entail: in some cases we might know that we have additional registers available (such as AVX registers on x86). There are cases where we might want to split a struct across registers and the stack. This also isn’t even getting into what returns could look like. Results are often passed through several layers of functions via ?, which can result in a lot of redundant register moves. Often, a Result is large enough that it doesn’t fit in registers, so each call in the ? stack has to inspect an ok bit by loading it from memory. Instead, a Result return might be implemented as an out-parameter pointer for the error, with the ok variant’s payload, and the is ok bit, returned as an Option. There are some fussy details with Into calls via ?, but the idea is implementable. Optimization-Dependent ABI Now, because we’re Rust, we’ve also got a trick up our sleeve that C doesn’t (but Go does)! When we’re generating the ABI that all callers will see (for -Zcallconv=fast), we can look at the function body. This means that a crate can advertise the precise ABI (in terms of register-passing) of its functions. This opens the door to a more extreme optimization-based ABIs. We can start by simply throwing out unused arguments: if the function never does anything with a parameter, don’t bother spending registers on it. Another example: suppose that we know that an &T argument is not retained (a question the borrow checker can answer at this point in the compiler) and is never converted to a raw pointer (or written to memory a raw pointer is taken of, etc). We also know that T is fairly small, and T: Freeze. Then, we can replace the reference with the pointee directly, passed by value. The most obvious candidates for this is APIs like HashMap::get(). If the key is something like an i32, we need to spill that integer to the stack and pass a pointer to it! This results in unnecessary, avoidable memory traffic. Profile-guided ABI is a step further. We might know that some arguments are hotter than others, which might cause them to be prioritized in the register allocation order. You could even imagine a case where a function takes a very large struct by reference, but three i64 fields are very hot, so the caller can preload those fields, passing them both by register and via the pointer to the large struct. The callee does not see additional cost: it had to issue those loads anyway. However, the caller probably has those values in registers already, which avoids some memory traffic. Instrumentation profiles may even indicate that it makes sense to duplicate whole functions, which are identical except for their ABIs. Maybe they take different arguments by register to avoid costly spills. Conclusion This is a bit more advanced (and ranty) than my usual writing, but this is an aspect of Rust that I find really frustrating. We could be doing so much better than C++ ever can (because of their ABI constraints). None of this is new ideas; this is literally how Go does it! So why don’t we? Part of the reason is that ABI codegen is complex, and as I described above, LLVM gives us very few useful knobs. It’s not a friendly part of rustc, and doing things wrong can have nasty consequences for usability. The other part is a lack of expertise. As of writing, only a handful of people contributing to rustc have the necessary grasp of LLVM’s semantics (and mood swings) to emit the Right Code such that we get good codegen and don’t crash LLVM. Another reason is compilation time. The more complicated the function signatures, the more prologue/epilogue code we have to generate that LLVM has to chew on. But -Zcallconv is intended to only be used with optimizations turned on, so I don’t think this is a meaningful complaint. Nor do I think the project’s Goodhartization of compilation time as a metric is healthy… but I do not think this is ultimately a relevant drawback. I, unfortunately, do not have the spare time to dive into fixing rustc’s ABI code, but I do know LLVM really well, and I know that this is a place where Rust has a low bus factor. For that reason, I am happy to provide the Rust compiler team expert knowledge on getting LLVM to do the right thing in service of making optimized code faster. Or just switch it to the codepath for extern \"C\" or extern \"fastcall\" since those are clearly better. We will always need to know how to generate code for the non-extern \"Rust\" calling conventions. ↩ It’s Complicated. Passing a double burns a wholeslot. This seems bad, but it can be beneficial since keeping a double in vector registers reduces register traffic, since usually, fp instructions use the vector registers (or the fp registers shadow the vector registers, like on ARM). ↩ On the one hand, you might say this “extended calling convention” isn’t an explicitly supported part of LLVM’s ccc calling convention. On the other hand, Hyrum’s Law cuts both ways: Rust is big enough of an LLVM user that LLVM cannot simply miscompile all Rust programs at this point, and the IR I propose Rust emits is extremely reasonable. If Rust causes LLVM to misbehave, that’s an LLVM bug, and we should fix LLVM bugs, not work around them. ↩ Only on -O1 or higher, bizarrely. At -O0, LLVM decides that all of the poisons must have the same value, so it copies a bunch of registers around needlessly. This seems like a bug? ↩ There are other cases where we might want to replace a union with one of its variants: for example, there’s a lot of cases where Result is secretly a union { ptr, u32 }, in which case it should be replaced with a single ptr. ↩ Related Posts 2023-11-27 / Designing a SIMD Algorithm from Scratch 2023-09-29 / What is a Matrix?

    "commentBody": "The Rust calling convention we deserve (mcyoung.xyz)215 points by matt_d 11 hours agohidepastfavorite70 comments pizlonator 5 hours agoThe main thing you want to do when optimizing the calling convention is measure its perf, not ruminate about what you think is good. Code performs well if it runs fast, not if it looks like it will. Sometimes, what the author calls bad code is actually the fastest thing you can do for totally not obvious reasons. The only way to find out is to measure the performance on some large benchmark. One reason why sometimes bad looking calling conventions perform well is just that they conserve argument registers, which makes the register allocator’s life a tad easier. Another reason is that the CPUs of today are optimized on traces of instructions generated by C compilers. If you generate code that looks like what the C compiler would do - which passes on the stack surprisingly often, especially if you’re MSVC - then you hit the CPU’s sweet spot somehow. Another reason is that inlining is so successful, so calls are a kind of unusual boundary on the hot path. It’s fine to have some jank on that boundary if it makes other things simpler. Not saying that the changes done here are bad, but I am saying that it’s weird to just talk about what looks like weird code without measuring. (Source: I optimized calling conventions for a living when I worked on JavaScriptCore. I also optimized other things too but calling conventions are quite dear to my heart. It was surprising how often bad-looking pass-on-the-stack code won on big, real code. Weird but true.) reply weinzierl 4 hours agoparentI very much agree with that especially since - like you said - code that looks like it will perform well, not always does. That being said I'd like to add that in my opinion performance measurement results should not be the only guiding principle. You said it yourself: \"Another reason is that the CPUs of today are optimized [..]\" The important word is \"today\". CPUs evolved and still do and a calling convention should be designed for the long term. Sadly, it means that it is beneficial to not deviate too much from what C++ does [1], because it is likely that future processor optimizations will be targeted in that direction. Apart from that it might be worthwhile to consider general principles that are not likely to change (e.g. conserve argument registers, as you mentioned), to make the calling convention robust and future proof. [1] It feels a bit strange, when I say that because I think Rust has become a bit too conservative in recent years, when it comes to its weirdness budget (https://steveklabnik.com/writing/the-language-strangeness-bu...). You cannot be better without being different, after all. reply workingjubilee 3 hours agorootparentThe Rust calling convention is actually defined as unstable, so 1.79 is allowed to have a different calling convention than 1.80 and so on. I don't think designing one for the long term is a real concern right now. reply weinzierl 3 hours agorootparentI know, but from what I understand there are initiatives to stabilize the ABI, which would also mean stabilizing calling conventions. I read the article in that broader context, even if it does not talk about that directly. reply JoshTriplett 58 minutes agorootparentThere's no proposal to stabilize the Rust ABI. There are proposals to define a separate stable ABI, which would not be the default ABI. (Such a separate stable ABI would want to plan for long-term performance, but the default ABI could continue to improve.) reply flohofwoe 3 hours agorootparentprev> and a calling convention should be designed for the long term ...isn't the article just about Rust code calling Rust code? That's a much more flexible situation than calling into operating system functions or into other languages. For calling within the same language a stable ABI is by for not as important as on the 'ecosystem boundaries', and might actually be harmful (see the related drama in the C++ world). reply leni536 3 hours agoparentprevYep. Also whether passing in registers is faster or not also depends on the function body. It doesn't make much sense if the first thing the function does is to take the address of the parameter and passes it to some opaque function. Then it needs to be spilled onto the stack anyway. It would be interesting to see calling convention optimizations based on function body. I think that would be safe for static functions in C, as long as their address is not taken. reply mkj 4 hours agoparentprevAnd remember that performance can include binary size, not just runtime speed. Current Rust seems to suffer in that regard for small platforms, calling convention could possibly help there wrt Result returns. reply fleventynine 2 hours agorootparentThe current calling convention is terrible for small platforms, especially when using Result in return position. For large enums, the compiler should put the discriminant in a register and the large variants on the stack. As is, you pay a significant code size penalty for idiomatic rust error handling. reply planede 1 hour agorootparentThere were proposals for optimizing this kind of stuff for C++ in particular for error handling, like: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p07... > Throwing such values behaves as-if the function returned union{R;E;}+bool where on success the function returns the normal return value R and on error the function returns the error value type E, both in the same return channel including using the same registers. The discriminant can use an unused CPU flag or a register reply workingjubilee 4 hours agoparentprevYour experience is not perfectly transferable. JITs have it easy on this because they've already gathered a wealth of information about the actually-executing-on CPU by the time they generate a single line of assembly. Calls appear on the hot path more often in purely statically compiled code because things like the runtime architectural feature set are not known, so you often reach inlining barriers precisely in the code that you would most like to optimize. reply saagarjha 1 hour agorootparentThe people who write JITs also write a bunch of C++ that gets statically compiled. reply JonChesterfield 9 hours agoprevReasonable sketch. This is missing the caller/called save distinction and makes the usual error of assigning a subset of the input registers to output. It's optimistic about debuggers understanding non-C-like calling conventions which I'd expect to be an abject failure, regardless of what dwarf might be able to encode. Changing ABI with optimization setting interacts really badly with separate compilation. Shuffling arguments around in bin packing fashion does work but introduces a lot of complexity in the compiler, not sure it's worth it relative to left to right first fit. It also makes it difficult for the developer to predict where arguments will end up. The general plan of having different calling conventions for addresses that escape than for those that don't is sound. Peeling off a prologue that does the impedance matching works well. Rust probably should be willing to have a different calling convention to C, though I'm not sure it should be a hardcoded one that every function uses. Seems an obvious thing to embed in the type system to me and allowing developer control over calling convention removes one of the performance advantages of assembly. reply LegionMammal978 9 hours agoparent> This is missing the caller/called save distinction and makes the usual error of assigning a subset of the input registers to output. Out of curiosity, what's so problematic about using some input registers as output registers? On the caller's side, you'd want to vacate the output registers between any two function calls regardless. And it occurs pretty widely in syscall conventions, to my binary-golfing detriment. Is it for the ease of the callee, so that it can set up the output values while keeping the input values in place? That would suggest trying to avoid overlap (by placing the output registers at the end of the input sequence), but I don't see how it would totally contraindicate any overlap. reply JonChesterfield 9 hours agorootparentYou should use all the input registers as output registers, unless your arch is doing some sliding window thing. The x64 proposal linked uses six to pass arguments in and three to return results. So returning six integers means three in registers, three on the stack, with three registers that were free to use containing nothing in particular. reply jcranmer 9 hours agorootparentThe LLVM calling conventions for x86 only allow returning 3 integer registers, 4 vector registers, and 2 x87 floating point registers (er, stack slots technically because x87 is weird). reply JonChesterfield 1 hour agorootparentSure. That would be an instance of the \"usual error\". The argument registers are usually caller save, where any unused ones get treated as scratch in the callee, in which case making them all available for returning data as well is zero cost. There's no reason not to, other than C makes returning multiple things awkward and splitting a struct across multiple registers is slightly annoying for the compiler. reply Denvercoder9 2 hours agorootparentprevLimiting a newly designed Rust ABI to whatever LLVM happens to support at the moment seems unnecessarily limiting. Yeah, you'd need to write some C++ to implement it, but that's not the end of the world, especially compared to getting stuck with arbitrary limits in your ABI for the next decade or two. reply anonymoushn 58 minutes agorootparentThis sort of thing is why integer division by 0 is UB in rust on targets where it's not UB, because it's UB in LLVM :) reply workingjubilee 4 hours agoparentprevAllowing developer control over calling conventions is also simultaneous with disallowing optimization in the case that Function A calls Function B calls Function C calls Function D etc. but along the way one or more of those functions could have their arguments swapped around to a different convention to reduce overhead. What semantics would preserve such an optimization but allow control? Would it just be illusory? And in practice assembly has the performance disadvantage of not being subject to most compiler optimizations, often including \"introspecting on its operation, determining it is fully redundant, and eliminating it entirely\". It's not the 1990s anymore. In the cases where that kind of optimization is not even possible to consider, though, the only place I'd expect inline assembly to be decisively beaten is using profile-guided optimization. That's the only way to extract more information than \"perfect awareness of how the application code works\", which the app dev has and the compiler dev does not. The call overhead can be eliminated by simply writing more assembly until you've covered the relevant hot boundaries. reply khuey 9 hours agoparentprev> It's optimistic about debuggers understanding non-C-like calling conventions which I'd expect to be an abject failure, regardless of what dwarf might be able to encode. DWARF doesn't encode bespoke calling conventions at all today. reply t0b1 7 hours agoparentprevThe bin packing will probably make it slower though, especially in the bool case since it will create dependency chains. For bools on x64, I don‘t think there‘s a better way than first having to get them in a register, shift them and then OR them into the result. The simple way creates a dependency chain of length 64 (which should also incur a 64 cycle penalty) but you might be able to do 6 (more like 12 realistically) cycles. But then again, where do these 64 bools come from? There aren‘t that many registers so you will have to reload them from the stack. Maybe the rust ABI already packs bools in structs this tightly so it‘s work that has to be done anyway but I don‘t know too much about it. And then the caller will have to unpack everything again. It might be easier to just teach the compiler to spill values into the result space on the stack (in cases the IR doesn‘t already store the result after the computation) which will likely also perform better. reply dzaima 6 hours agorootparentUnpacking bools is cheap - to move any bit into a flag is just a single 'test' instruction, which is as good as it gets if you have multiple bools (other than passing each in a separate flag, which is quite undesirable). Doing the packing in a tree fashion to reduce latency is trivial, and store→load latency isn't free either depending on the microarchitecture (and at the counts where log2(n) latency becomes significant you'll be at IPC limit anyway). Packing vs store should end up at roughly the same instruction counts too - a store vs an 'or', and exact same amount of moving between flags ang GPRs. Reaching 64 bools might be a bit crazy, but 4-8 seems reasonably attainable from each of many arguments being an Option, where the packing would reduce needed register/stack slot count by ~2. Where possible it would of course make sense to pass values in separate registers instead of in one, but when the alternative is spilling to stack, packing is still worthy of consideration. reply saghm 6 hours agorootparent> Reaching 64 bools might be a bit crazy, but 4-8 seems reasonably attainable from each of many arguments being an Option, where the packing would reduce needed register/stack slot count by ~2 I don't have a strong sense of how much more common owned `Option` types are than references, but it's worth noting that if `T` is a reference, `Option` will just use a pointer and treat the null value as `None` under the hood to avoid needing any tag. There are probably other types where this is done as well (maybe `NonZero` integer types?) reply rayiner 9 hours agoparentprevAlso, most modern processors will easily forward the store to the subsequent read and has a bunch of tricks for tracking the stack state. So much does putting things in registers help anyway? reply dwattttt 7 hours agorootparentMore broadly: processor design has been optimised around C style antics for a long time, trying to optimise the code produced away from that could well inhibit processor tricks in such a way that the result is _slower_ than if you stuck with the \"looks terrible but is expected & optimised\" status quo reply eru 5 hours agorootparentReminds me of Fortran compilers recognising the naive three-nested-loops matrix multiplication and optimising it to something sensible. reply kevingadd 4 hours agorootparentprevForwarding isn't unlimited, though, as I understand it. The CPU has limited-size queues and buffers through which reordering, forwarding, etc. can happen. So I wouldn't be surprised if using registers well takes pressure off of that machinery and ensures that it works as you expect for the data that isn't in registers. (Looked around randomly to find example data for this) https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/11/08/amds-zen-4-part-2-memo... claims that Zen 4's store queue only holds 64 entries, for example, and a 512-bit register store eats up two.

If the legacy shim tail calls the Rust-calling-convention function, won't that prevent it from fixing any return value differences in the calling convention? reply JonChesterfield 9 hours agoparentYes.

In language implementations where GC isn't shared by the different languages calling each other you're always going to have this problem. Mixing managed/unmanaged code is both an old idea and actively researched. It's almost always a terrible idea to call into managed code from unmanaged code unless you're working directly with an embedded runtime that's been designed for it.

With that said, Mono has been a staple choice for embedding in game-script style scenarios, in particular, because of the ability to directly call its methods inside (provided the caller honors the calling convention correctly), but it has been slowly becoming more of a liability as you are missing out on a lot of performance by not hosting CoreCLR instead. For .dll/.so/.dylib's, it is easier and often better to just build a native library with naot instead (the links above, you can also produce statically linkable binaries but it might have issues on e.g. macOS which has...not the most reliable linker that likes to take breaking changes). This type of library works in almost every scenario a library implemented in C/C++/Rust with C exports does.

Using the exports boils down to just this https://github.com/kostya9/DotnetObsPluginWithNativeAOT/blob... and specifying correct build flags. reply duped 6 hours agorootparentI haven't been looking for those because I don't work with .NET. Regardless, what you're linking still needs callers and callees to agree on calling convention and special binding annotations across FFI boundaries which isn't particularly interesting from the perspective of language implementation like the promises of Graal or WASM + GC + component model. reply neonsunset 5 hours agorootparentThere is no free lunch. WASM just means another lowest common denominator abstraction for FFI. I'm also looking forward to WASM getting actually good so .NET could properly target it (because shipping WASM-compiled GC is really, really painful, it works acceptably today, but could be better). Current WasmGC spec is pretty much unusable by any language that has non-primitive GC implementation. Just please don't run WASM on the server, we're already getting diminishing generational performance gains in hardware, no need to reduce them further. The exports in the examples follow C ABI with respective OS/ISA-specific calling convention. reply duped 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are more managed langauges than Go, Java, and C#. Swift (and Objective C with ARC) are a bit different in that they don't use mark and sweep/generational GCs for automatic memory management so it's significantly less of an issue. Compare with Lua, Python, JS, etc where there's a serialization boundary between the two. But I stand by what I said. It's generally unwise to mix the two, particularly calling unmanaged code from managed code. I wouldn't say it's \"not a problem\" because there are very few environments where you don't pay some cost for mixing and matching between managed/unmanaged code, and the environments designed around it are built from first principles to support it, like .NET. More interesting to me are Graal and WASM (once GC support lands) which should make it much easier to deal with. reply mrits 7 hours agoparentprevI have to use Rust and Swift quite a bit. I basically just landed on sending a byte array of serialized protobufs back and forth with cookie cutter function calls. If this is your full time job I can see how you might think that is lame, but I really got tired of coming back to the code every few weeks and not remembering how to do anything. reply neonsunset 8 hours agoparentprevYou have to go through C bindings, but FFI is very far from being Go's strongest suit (if we don't count Cgo), so if that's what interests you, it might be better to explore a different language. reply vrotaru 4 hours agoprevThere was an interesting aproach to this, in an experimental language some time ago fn f1 (x, y) #-> // Use C calling conventions fn f2 (x, y) -> // use fast calling conventions The first one was mostly for interacting with C code, and the compiler knew how to call each function. reply magicalhippo 2 hours agoparentDelphi, and I'm sure others, have had[1] this for ages: When you declare a procedure or function, you can specify a calling convention using one of the directives register, pascal, cdecl, stdcall, safecall, and winapi. As in your example, cdecl is for calling C code, while stdcall/winapi on Windows for calling Windows APIs.

Debugger writers may not be happy, but maybe lldb supports all conventions supported by llvm. reply Animats 9 hours agoprevGiven that the current Rust compiler does aggressive inlining and then optimizes, is this worth the trouble? If the function being called is tiny, it should be inlined. If it's big, you're probably going to spend some time in it and the call overhead is minor. reply celeritascelery 8 hours agoparentRuntime functions (eg dyn Trait) can’t be inlined for one, so this would help there. But also if you can make calls cheaper then you don’t have to be so aggressive with inlining, which can help with code size and compile times. reply jonstewart 9 hours agoparentprevProbably? A complex function that’s not a good fit for inlining will probably access memory a few times and those accesses are likely to be the bottlenecks for the function. Passing on the stack squeezes that bottleneck tighter — more cache pressure, load/stores, etc. If Rust can pass arguments optimally in a decent ratio of function calls, not only is it avoiding the several clocks of L1 access, it’s hopefully letting the CPU get to those essential memory bottlenecks faster. There are probably several percentage points of win here…? But I am drinking wine and not doing the math, so… reply quotemstr 9 hours agoprevThe C calling convention kind of sucks. True, can't change the C calling convention, but that doesn't make it any less unfortunate. We should use every available caller-saved register for arguments and return values, but in the traditional SysV ABI, we use only one register (sometimes two) for return values. If you return a struct Point3D { long x, y, z }, you spill the stack even though we could damned well put Point3D in rax, rdi, and rsi. There are other tricks other systems use. For example, if I recall correctly, in SBCL, functions set the carry flag on exit if they're returning multiple values. Wouldn't it be nice if we used the carry flag in indicate, e.g. whether a Result contains an error. reply fch42 2 hours agoparent\"sucks\" is a strong word but with respect to return values, you're right. The C calling conventions, everywhere really, support what C supports - returning one argument. Well, not even that (struct returns ... nope). Kind of \"who'd have thought\" in C I guess. And then there's the C++ argument \"just make it inline then\". On the other hand, memory spills happen. For SPARC, for example, the gracious register space (windows) ended up with lots of unused regs in simple functions and a cache-busting huge stack size footprint, definitely so if you ever spilled the register ring. Even with all the mov in x86 (and there is always lots of it, at least in compiled C code) to rearrange data to \"where it needed to be\", it often ended up faster. When you only look at the callee code (code generated for a given function signature), it's tempting to say \"oh it'll definitely be fastest if this arg is here and that return there\". You don't know the callers though. There's no guarantee the argument marshalling will end up \"pass through\" or the returns are \"hot\" consumed. Say, a struct Point { x: i32, y: i32, z: i32 } as arg/return; if the caller does something like mystruct.deepinside.point[i] = func(mystruct.deepinside.point[i]) in a loop then moving it in/out of regs may be overhead or even prevent vectorisation. But the callee cannot know. Unless... the compiler can see both and inline (back to the C++ excuse). Yes, for function call chaining javascript/rust style it might be nice/useful \"in principle\". But in practice only if the compiler has enough caller/callee insight to keep the hot working set \"passthrough\" (no spills). The lowest hanging fruit on calling is probably to remove the \"functions return one primitive thing\" that's ingrained in the C ABIs almost everywhere. For the rest ? A lot of benchmarking and code generation statistics. I'd love to see more of that. Even if it's dry stuff. reply flohofwoe 1 hour agorootparent> Well, not even that (struct returns ... nope). C compilers actually pack small struct return values into registers: https://godbolt.org/z/51q5se86s It's just limited that on x86-64, GCC and Clang use up to two registers while MSVC only uses one. Also, IMHO there is no such thing as a \"C calling convention\", there are many different calling conventions that are defined by the various runtime environments (usually the combination of CPU architecture and operating system). C compilers just must adhere to those CPU+OS calling conventions like any other compiler that wants to call directly into operating system functions. IMHO the whole performance angle is a bit overblown though, for 'high frequency functions' the compiler should inline the function body anyway. And for situations where that's not possible (e.g. calling into DLLs), the DLL should expose an API that doesn't require such 'high frequency functions' in the first place. reply sheepscreek 9 hours agoprevVery interesting but pretty quickly went over my head.

    "title": "Improving Postgres Task Queues with Deterministic Round-Robin Queueing",
    "originLink": "https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/multi-tenant-queues",
    "originBody": "Blog An unfair advantage: multi-tenant queues in Postgres An unfair advantage: multi-tenant queues in Postgres Alexander Belanger Published on April 18, 2024 TL;DR - we've been implementing fair queueing strategies for Postgres-backed task queues, so processing Bob's 10,000 files doesn't crowd out Alice's 1-page PDF. We've solved this in Hatchet (opens in a new tab) and Hatchet Cloud (opens in a new tab) so you don't have to — here's a look at how we did it. Introduction We set the scene with a simple user request: they'd like to upload and parse a PDF. Or an image, CSV, audio file — it doesn't really matter. What matters is that the processing of this file can take ages, and scales ≥ linearly with the size of the file. Perhaps you're an astute developer and realized that processing this file might impact the performance of your API — or more likely, the new file upload feature you pushed on Friday has you explaining to your family that nephew Jimmy's baseball game on Saturday will have to wait. In the postmortem, you decide to offload processing this file to somewhere outside of the core web server, asynchronously on a new worker process. The user can now upload a file, the web server quickly sends it off to the worker, and life goes on. That is, until Bob decides to upload his entire hard drive — probably also on a Saturday — and your document processing worker now goes down. At this point (or ideally before this point), you introduce…the task queue. This allows you to queue each file processing task and only dispatch the amount of tasks each worker can handle at a time. But while this solves the problem of the worker crashing, it introduces a new problem, because you've intentionally bottlenecked the system. Which means that when Bob uploads his second hard drive, a new issue emerges - Alice's 1-page file upload gets stuck at the back of the queue: You're now worried about fairness — specifically, how can you guarantee fair execution time to both Bob and Alice? We'd like to introduce a strategy that's easy to implement in a Postgres-backed queue — and more difficult in other queueing systems — deterministic round-robin queueing. The setup Let's start with some code! We're implementing a basic Postgres-backed task queue, where workers poll for events off the queue at some interval. You can find all the code used in these examples — along with some nice helper seed and worker commands — in this repo: github.com/abelanger5/postgres-fair-queue (opens in a new tab). Note that I chose sqlc to write these examples, so you might see some sqlc.arg and sqlc.narg in the example queries. Our tasks are very simple — they have a created_at time, some input data, and an auto-incremented id: -- CreateEnum CREATE TYPE \"TaskStatus\" AS ENUM ( 'QUEUED', 'RUNNING', 'SUCCEEDED', 'FAILED', 'CANCELLED' ); -- CreateTable CREATE TABLE tasks ( id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL, created_at timestamp, status \"TaskStatus\" NOT NULL, args jsonb, PRIMARY KEY (id) ); The query which pops tasks off the queue looks like the following: -- name: PopTasks :many WITH eligible_tasks AS ( SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE \"status\" = 'QUEUED' ORDER BY id ASC FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT COALESCE(sqlc.narg('limit'), 10) ) UPDATE tasks SET \"status\" = 'RUNNING' FROM eligible_tasks WHERE tasks.id = eligible_tasks.id RETURNING tasks.*; Note the use of FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED: this means that workers which concurrently pull tasks off the queue won't pull duplicate tasks, because they won't read any rows locked by other worker transactions. The polling logic looks something like this: type HandleTask func(ctx context.Context, task *dbsqlc.Task) func poll(ctx context.Context, handleTask HandleTask) {for { select { caseHash Join (cost=259.44..514.23 rows=1 width=78) (actual time=125.423..141.271 rows=100 loops=1) Hash Cond: (tasks.id = t1.id) -> Seq Scan on tasks (cost=0.00..254.60 rows=48 width=14) (actual time=0.566..10.550 rows=10000 loops=1) Filter: (status = 'QUEUED'::\"TaskStatus\") -> Hash (cost=258.84..258.84 rows=48 width=76) (actual time=124.155..124.213 rows=100 loops=1) Buckets: 1024 Batches: 1 Memory Usage: 18kB -> Subquery Scan on t1 (cost=258.24..258.84 rows=48 width=76) (actual time=123.500..123.791 rows=100 loops=1) -> Limit (cost=258.24..258.36 rows=48 width=52) (actual time=122.951..123.066 rows=100 loops=1) -> Sort (cost=258.24..258.36 rows=48 width=52) (actual time=122.830..122.866 rows=100 loops=1)Sort Key: (row_number() OVER (?)), t.idSort Method: top-N heapsort Memory: 36kB-> WindowAgg (cost=255.94..256.90 rows=48 width=52) (actual time=77.962..111.874 rows=10000 loops=1)-> Sort (cost=255.94..256.06 rows=48 width=44) (actual time=76.751..79.917 rows=10000 loops=1)Sort Key: t.group_key, t.idSort Method: quicksort Memory: 1010kB-> Seq Scan on tasks t (cost=0.00..254.60 rows=48 width=44) (actual time=0.093..15.310 rows=10000 loops=1)Filter: (status = 'QUEUED'::\"TaskStatus\") Planning Time: 37.690 ms Execution Time: 159.286 ms (20 rows) The important part here is the WindowAgg cost - computing a partition across all rows on the groupKey naturally involves querying every QUEUED row (in this case, 10000 tasks). We expect this to scale sublinearly with the number of rows in the input - let's take a guess and look at how our workers do on 25,000 enqueued rows: 2024/04/05 13:06:24 (worker 2) sleeping for 666.666666ms 2024/04/05 13:06:24 (worker 0) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/05 13:06:24 (worker 1) sleeping for 333.333333ms 2024/04/05 13:06:26 (worker 0) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:26 (worker 1) popped 0 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:26 (worker 2) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:27 (worker 0) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:27 (worker 1) popped 0 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:28 (worker 2) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:29 (worker 0) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:29 (worker 1) popped 0 tasks 2024/04/05 13:06:29 (worker 2) popped 100 tasks Sure enough, because we're seeing execution times greater than 333ms, we start losing tasks on worker 1. This is very problematic, because not only is our queue backlog increasing, but the throughput of our workers is decreasing, and this isn't a problem we can solve by throwing more workers at the queue. This is a general problem in systems that are stable for a long time until some external trigger (for example, workers going down for an hour) causes the system to fail in an unexpected way, leading to the system being unrecoverable. A second practical solution to this issue is to create an OVERFLOW status on the task queue, and set an upper bound on the number of enqueued tasks, to ensure worker performance doesn't drop below a certain threshold. We then can periodically check the overflow queue and place the overflow into the queued status. This is a good idea regardless of the query we write to get new tasks. But practical advice aside, let's take a look at how to write this query to avoid performance degradation at such a small number of enqueued tasks. Improving performance Sequencing algorithm The main issue, as we've identified, is the window function which is searching across every row that is QUEUED. What we were hoping to accomplish with the partition method was filling up each group's queue, ordering each group by the task id, and order the tasks by their rank within each group. Our goal is to write a query that is constant-time (or as close as possible to constant-time) when reading from the queue, so we can avoid our system being unrecoverable. Even using a JOIN LATERAL instead of PARTITION BY will get slower as the number of partitions (i.e. groups) increases. Also, maintaining each task's rank after reads (for example, decrementing the task's rank within the group after read) will also get slower the more tasks we add to a group. What if instead of computing the rank within the group via the PARTITION BY method at read time, we wrote a sequence number at write time which guarantees round-robin enqueueing? At first glance, this seems difficult - we don't know that Alice will need to enqueue 1 task in the future if Bob enqueued 10,000 tasks now. We can solve for this by reserving contiguous blocks of IDs for future enqueued runs which belong to groups which don't exist yet or don't have a task assigned for that block yet. We're going to partition BIGINT (max=9,223,372,036,854,775,807) into blocks of blockLength: Next, let's assign task IDs according to the following algorithm: Maintain a unique numerical id i for each distinct group, and maintain a pointer p to the last block that was enqueued for each group - we'll call this p(i) . Maintain a pointer p to the block containing the maximum task ID which doesn't have a QUEUED status (in other words, the maximum assigned task), call this p_max_assigned. If there are no tasks in the queue, set this to the maximum block across all p(i). Initialize p_max_assigned at 0. When a task is created in group j: If this is a new group j is added, initialize p(j) to p_max_assigned If this is an existing group j, set p(j) to the greater of p_max_assigned or p(j) + 1 Set the id of the task to j + blockLength * p(j) *Note: we are making a critical assumption that the number of unique group keys will always be below the blockLength , and increasing the blockLength in the future would be a bit involved. A blockLength of ~1 million gives us ~1 billion task executions. To increase the block length, it's recommended that you add an offset equal to the the maximum task id, and start assigning task ids from there. We will also (in the worst case) cap out at 1 billion executed tasks, though this can be fixed by reassigning IDs when close to this limit.* SQL implemenation To actually implement this, let's add a new set of tables to our queue implementation. We'll add a table for task_groups, which maintains the pointer p(i) from above, along with a table called task_addr_ptrs which maintains p_max_assigned from above: CREATE TABLE task_groups ( id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL, group_key text, block_addr BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY (id) ); ALTER TABLE task_groups ADD CONSTRAINT unique_group_key UNIQUE (group_key); ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tasks_group_key FOREIGN KEY (group_key) REFERENCES task_groups (group_key); CREATE TABLE task_addr_ptrs ( max_assigned_block_addr BIGINT NOT NULL, onerow_id bool PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT true, CONSTRAINT onerow_uni CHECK (onerow_id) ); Next, we'll write our CreateTask query using a blockLength of 1024*1024: WITH group_key_task AS ( INSERT INTO task_groups ( id, group_key, block_addr ) VALUES ( COALESCE((SELECT max(id) FROM task_groups), -1) + 1, sqlc.arg('group_key')::text, (SELECT max_assigned_block_addr FROM task_addr_ptrs) ) ON CONFLICT (group_key) DO UPDATE SET group_key = EXCLUDED.group_key, block_addr = GREATEST( task_groups.block_addr + 1, (SELECT max_assigned_block_addr FROM task_addr_ptrs) ) RETURNING id, group_key, block_addr ) INSERT INTO tasks ( id, created_at, status, args, group_key ) VALUES ( (SELECT id FROM group_key_task) + 1024 * 1024 * (SELECT block_addr FROM group_key_task), COALESCE(sqlc.arg('created_at')::timestamp, now()), 'QUEUED', COALESCE(sqlc.arg('args')::jsonb, '{}'::jsonb), sqlc.arg('group_key')::text ) RETURNING *; The great thing about this is that our PopTasks query doesn't change, we've just changed how we assign IDs. However, we do need to make sure to update task_addr_ptrs in the same transaction that we pop tasks from the queue: -- name: UpdateTaskPtrs :one WITH max_assigned_id AS ( SELECT id FROM tasks WHERE \"status\" != 'QUEUED' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1 ) UPDATE task_addr_ptrs SET max_assigned_block_addr = COALESCE( FLOOR((SELECT id FROM max_assigned_id)::decimal / 1024 / 1024), COALESCE( (SELECT MAX(block_addr) FROM task_groups), 0 ) ) FROM max_assigned_id RETURNING task_addr_ptrs.*; Against 1 million enqueued tasks with 1000 partitions, we still only need to search across 100 rows: QUERY PLAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nested Loop (cost=12.89..853.72 rows=100 width=77) (actual time=17.521..20.227 rows=100 loops=1) CTE eligible_tasks -> Limit (cost=0.42..10.21 rows=100 width=14) (actual time=1.669..16.365 rows=100 loops=1) -> LockRows (cost=0.42..97842.23 rows=999484 width=14) (actual time=1.662..16.231 rows=100 loops=1) -> Index Scan using tasks_pkey on tasks tasks_1 (cost=0.42..87847.39 rows=999484 width=14) (actual time=0.711..13.331 rows=100 loops=1) Filter: (status = 'QUEUED'::\"TaskStatus\") -> HashAggregate (cost=2.25..3.25 rows=100 width=8) (actual time=17.299..17.497 rows=100 loops=1) Group Key: eligible_tasks.id Batches: 1 Memory Usage: 24kB -> CTE Scan on eligible_tasks (cost=0.00..2.00 rows=100 width=8) (actual time=1.720..16.959 rows=100 loops=1) -> Index Scan using tasks_pkey on tasks (cost=0.42..8.40 rows=1 width=77) (actual time=0.022..0.022 rows=1 loops=100) Index Cond: (id = eligible_tasks.id) Planning Time: 13.979 ms Execution Time: 21.433 ms You may also have noticed that because we stopped using the window function, we've removed the issue of selecting for previously locked rows. So even if we start 10 workers at the same time, we're guaranteed to select unique rows again: 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 9) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 8) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 4) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 0) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 1) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 2) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 6) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 3) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 5) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:08 (worker 7) sleeping for 0s 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 1) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 2) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 7) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 0) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 8) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 9) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 3) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 6) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 5) popped 100 tasks 2024/04/08 16:28:09 (worker 4) popped 100 tasks This doesn't come without a tradeoff: our writes are slower due to continuously updating the block_addr parameter on the task_group. However, even the writes are constant-time, so the throughput on writes is still on the order of 500 to 1k tasks/second. If you'd prefer a higher write throughput, setting a small limit for placing tasks in the OVERFLOW queue and using the partition method from above may be a better approach. Introducing concurrency limits In the above implementation, we had a simple LIMIT statement to set an upper bound of the number of tasks a worker should execute. But what if we want to set a concurrency limit for each group of tasks? For example, not only do we want to limit a worker to 100 tasks globally, but we limit each group to 5 concurrent tasks (we'll refer to this number as concurrency below). This ensures that even if there are slots available on the worker, they are not automatically filled by the same user, which could again crowd out other users in the near future. Luckily, this is quite simple with the implementation above. Because of the way we've divided task ids across different block addresses, we can simply limit concurrency by searching only from the minimum queued ID min_id to min_id + blockLength * concurrency: -- name: PopTasksWithConcurrency :many WITH min_id AS ( SELECT COALESCE(min(id), 0) AS min_id FROM tasks WHERE \"status\" = 'QUEUED' ), eligible_tasks AS ( SELECT tasks.id FROM tasks WHERE \"status\" = 'QUEUED' AND \"id\" >= (SELECT min_id FROM min_id) AND \"id\" < (SELECT min_id FROM min_id) + sqlc.arg('concurrency')::int * 1024 * 1024 ORDER BY id ASC FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT COALESCE(sqlc.narg('limit')::int, 10) ) UPDATE tasks SET \"status\" = 'RUNNING' FROM eligible_tasks WHERE tasks.id = eligible_tasks.id RETURNING tasks.*; This guarantees an additional level of fairness which makes it even harder for Bob's workloads to interfere with Alice's. Final thoughts We've covered deterministic round-robin queueing, but it turns out that many systems just need approximate fairness guarantees (\"deterministic\" in this case refers to the fact that tasks are processed in a deterministic order on subsequent reads - as opposed to using something like ORDER BY RANDOM()). But there are other approaches which provide approximate fairness, such as shuffle sharding (opens in a new tab), which we'll show how to implement in Postgres in a future post. If you have suggestions on making these queries more performant - or perhaps you spotted a bug - I'd love to hear from you in our Discord (opens in a new tab).

    "commentBody": "Multi-tenant queues in Postgres (hatchet.run)180 points by abelanger 18 hours agohidepastfavorite30 comments ndriscoll 12 hours agoYou've got something wonky going on with that query plan for the 2nd partition by attempt. In particular the seq scan on tasks to do the `(tasks.id = eligible_tasks.id)` hash join seems odd. The filter on queued status in `CTE eligible_tasks` (and not in the last join) also seems weird. Is that plan for the same query in the article? If you add an index on `group_key, id WHERE status = 'queued'` and remove the 2nd `WHERE tasks.\"status\" = 'QUEUED'` (I believe that's redundant?), you might get a better plan. You'd want something to make sure you're not preferring one group_key as well. I think you should be able to solve your problem with workers having zero tasks by moving the LIMIT into the second CTE? It's also useful in practice to have something like a worker_id and timestamp and not just set status to RUNNING in case a worker gets stuck/dies and you need to unclaim the work. reply abelanger 10 hours agoparentAh, great catch - I just pushed an update to match the query from the article. I wasn't looking at much except for the WindowAgg line, thank you! I tried with a similar indexing strategy - it did make a very noticeable difference, breaking at about 40000 enqueued tasks instead of 25000. I left indexing out of the article because it can open up a different can of worms with performance degradation over a longer time horizon. I also tried with an `ORDER BY RANDOM()` across group keys first, which does help with fairness but breaks the \"deterministic\" element. reply ndriscoll 10 hours agorootparentWith your updated plan, you have > Hash Cond: (tasks.id = t1.id) > -> Seq Scan on tasks (cost=0.00..254.60 rows=48 width=14) (actual time=0.566..10.550 rows=10000 loops=1) > Filter: (status = 'QUEUED'::\"TaskStatus\") So it's still doing a seq scan on tasks when I'd expect it to join using the PK. It must be getting tripped up by the redundant filter on queued status. Try removing that. I ninja edited my previous comment, but if you move the LIMIT to the 2nd CTE, that should fix your issue with workers not getting work. If you do that and add the other index I think in principle it should be able to do everything by maintaining a priority queue of the heads of each partition (which are each pre-sorted by the index now). idk if pg does that though. If it does, then that portion of the query should be streamed, so you don't need to try to limit it early to avoid a sort of 10k elements when you only need 10. Then if you remove the redundant QUEUED check, it should be doing everything else through indexes. Basically, if doing this manually I'd expect the \"good\" solution to do this in a way where starting from an index, each row is streamed (i.e. no full sort) with logn complexity. So I look at it from a perspective of \"how do I get the database to do what I'd do by hand?\" reply abelanger 10 hours agorootparentI created a gist with these recommendations - certainly an improvement, but I don't think it gets around the `WindowAgg` running across all 10k rows: https://gist.github.com/abelanger5/5c1a75755072239716cb587a2.... Does this accurately implement your suggestions? Happy to try out other suggestions, but I haven't found a way to get a window function or `JOIN LATERAL` to scale in near-constant time for this queueing strategy. reply ndriscoll 9 hours agorootparentIt looks like now it does still only pull 100 rows out of the sort (so moving the limit into the 2nd cte didn't hurt). It isn't doing all 10000 rows now though, which is interesting. By any chance, do you have 9200 different tenants? If so that makes sense. What I suggested would work when you have a small number of tenants with queued work (it scales n log n with tenants with queued work, but log n with amount of tasks that a single tenant has queued). So if you're currently testing with many tenants queueing at once, you could see how it behaves with like 20 tenants where one has 9k items and the others have ~50 each. Then it sort of depends on how your distribution looks in practice to know whether that's acceptable. You could also probably do tricks where individual workers filter to specific tenant IDs in the first CTE (e.g. filter group_key mod num_workers = worker_id) to reduce that cardinality if you expect it to be large. Or you could e.g. select 100 random group_keys as a first step and use that to filter the window, but then that needs another partial index on just `group_key where status = queued`. Edit: I see it's still doing a seq scan on tasks. There is a PK on id, right? It knows there's only 100 rows from the rest of the query so it seems odd to me that it would decide to scan the table. You could try putting a hash index on id if it's refusing to use the btree index I guess. Or it might change its mind if you add 1M SUCCEEDED tasks or something. Another thing to consider is that out of the box, pg's default config for the planner is tuned to like 20 year old hardware. You need to tweak the io costs for SSDs and tell it you have more RAM if you haven't done that. See e.g. https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/ for better starting values. reply plandis 12 hours agoprevAt a previous job we did something similar but ended up having workers first poll another table to determine which tenant to query against. We called these items tokens and they represented a finite amount of dedicated thread time for processing a specific tenants’ queue. What this looked like was a worker thread would first query the token table for which tenant to process eligible tasks from, and then update the token to take a timed lock and during that time would solely process eligible tasks from a specific tenant. This has some nice properties: 1. You can scale different tenants using different amounts of tokens which means different but controlled amounts of thread time. 2. It allows for locality on your worker thread. Within a specific tenant the processing was usually similar so any shared resources could be cached and reused after polling for additional eligible tasks from the tenants queue. reply magicalhippo 1 hour agoparentReminded me of the token bucket[1] algorithm. Good point about locality. [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket reply klysm 1 hour agoparentprevI like this approach a lot, but I’m unsure about time based vs number of items based fairness. I guess it really depends on the application. reply aranw 37 minutes agoprevThanks for this write up. Really interesting I've built queues using Postgres before but never anything this complex so I'm sure this article will come in use and be handy in future! reply jperras 12 hours agoprevIs the `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in the CTE necessary? Granted my understanding of Postgres row-level locking and their interaction with CTEs may be a bit lacking, but according to the docs[1]: The sub-statements in WITH are executed concurrently with each other and with the main query. Therefore, when using data-modifying statements in WITH, the order in which the specified updates actually happen is unpredictable. All the statements are executed with the same snapshot (see Chapter 13), so they cannot “see” one another's effects on the target tables. 1. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html#QU... reply mslot 12 hours agoparentRead committed mode (PostgreSQL's default) can get pretty funky. If two transactions concurrently perform a SELECT (may be in a CTE) followed by an UPDATE, then they might see and try to update the same rows. That's often undesirable, for instance in the example of a queue where messages are supposed to arrive ~once. Serializable mode would \"solve\" the problem by letting one transaction fail, and expects the application to retry or otherwise deal with the consequences. FOR UPDATE is a precision tool for working around read committed limitations. It ensures rows are locked by whichever transaction reads them first, such that the second reader blocks and (here's the funky part) when the first transaction is done it actually reads the latest row version instead of the one that was in the snapshot. That's semantically a bit weird, but nonetheless very useful, and actually matches how updates work in PostgreSQL. The biggest issue with SELECT..FOR UPDATE is that it blocks waiting for concurrent updaters to finish, even if the rows no longer match its filter after the update. The SKIP LOCKED avoids all that by simply skipping the locked rows in the SELECT. Semantically even weirder, but very useful for queues. reply jperras 12 hours agorootparentAh, I see - the default transactional isolation level is what I wasn't accounting for. Thanks for the explanation! Very much appreciated. reply nosefrog 5 hours agoprevIs a fair queue worth it vs spinning up more capacity? I've worked on multiple projects where we've ended up ripping out a queue and just spinning up more machines to handle the load synchronously instead. reply strken 1 hour agoparentIs it a choice? Most projects I've worked on had times when they became overwhelmed with requests; a queue handles this case, but more capacity just makes it rarer. Ideally you want enough capacity to handle X% of requests within Y milliseconds and a queue to deal with the leftovers, and I suppose if your X is low enough then a fair queue becomes a necessity. reply vidarh 3 hours agoparentprevMore capacity won't address operations that the originator isn't willing to (or can't) hang around to wait for and/or that are long-running enough that restarts due to failures might be needed. That's the most immediate reason: Tasks where no amount of capacity will remove the need to have some form of queueing mechanism. For complex enough workflows, queues are also often helpful at addressing potentially failing stages in ways that are easier to debug. But in that case you want your queue to be closer to a state machine where actually waiting in the queue for much time is the exception. You can just build a state machine for that too, ensuring the inputs to the stage about to execute are recorded in a durable, restartable way. But sometimes you may need more copies of the same type of job, and soon you have something that looks and smells much like a queue anyway. Then lastly, spikes. But they only really help well enough if you still spin up more machines aggressively enough that the wait time doesn't get long enough to be perceived as just as bad as or worse than an immediate error, so it does make sense to ask your question. A queue also doesn't need to be complex. If it gets complex, that increases the reasons to ask your question for that specific system. If it potentially grows large, as well (sometimes the solution to that is simply to refuse to queue if the queue exceeds a certain size or the processing time goes above a certain threshold). Queues are great when appropriate, but they do often get used as a \"solution\" to a scaling problem that hasn't been sufficiently analyzed, which sounds like might have been the case in your examples. reply datascienced 4 hours agoparentprevI guess a queue handles spikes, and is OK for async-allowed operations such as generating a PDF and email it over say loading a web page. A queue may give you time to scale up too? reply time0ut 9 hours agoprevVery cool. Bookmarked in case I ever need to do this. I have implemented a transactional outbox in postgres using a simpler version of this plus a trigger to notify listening workers. It worked well and vastly outpaced the inserting processes. It easily handled several million tasks per hour without issue. It is also nice the article showed the correct CTE based form of the query. It is possible to naively write the query without it and sometimes get way more tasks than you asked for when there are concurrent workers. I discovered that pretty quickly but it had me pulling my hair out… reply jvolkman 10 hours agoprevI have my queue workers maintain a list of task owners they've already processed, and prefer to get a task from an owner they've least-recently seen (or haven't seen) using `ORDER BY array_position(:seen_owner_ids, owner_id) desc`. Each new task's owner_id is inserted into the front of the list (and removed elsewhere if it exists). But I have a relatively small number of possible `owner_id` values at any given time. reply phibz 9 hours agoprevWhy not something like Kafka or Redis? reply teraflop 4 hours agoparentThe most straightforward reason is that if you need a transactional database anyway, then moving the queue into the DB allows you to atomically en/dequeue messages at the same time as making other updates. Which can massively simplify your architecture because it eliminates an enormous category of possible failure modes. (Or it can massively improve your system correctness, if you didn't realize those failure modes were possible.) reply klysm 1 hour agoparentprevUsing Kafka as a work queue is widely documented as a mistake. Using a single database results in a lot of operational simplicity and you get to skip a lot of distributed systems when all your state is in a single system reply dewey 6 hours agoparentprevAlso most of the times you already have a database so why not use that instead of adding another service to the pile. reply hipadev23 7 hours agoparentprevBecause that’s sane, easy, and boring. reply mind-blight 5 hours agoprevSuper cool!

    "title": "Supabase Storage introduces S3 protocol support",
    "originLink": "https://supabase.com/blog/s3-compatible-storage",
    "originBody": "Supabase Storage is now officially an S3-Compatible Storage Provider. This is one of the most-requested features and is available today in public alpha. Resumable Uploads are also transitioning from Beta to Generally Available. The Supabase Storage Engine is fully open source and is one of the few storage solutions that offer 3 interoperable protocols to manage your files: Standard uploads: simple to get started Resumable uploads: for resumable uploads with large uploads S3 uploads: for compatibility across a plethora of tools S3 compatibility# We always strive to adopt industry standards at Supabase. Supporting standards makes workloads portable, a key product principle. The S3 API is undoubtedly a storage standard, and we're making it accessible to developers of various experience-levels. The S3 protocol is backwards compatible with our other APIs. If you are already using Storage via our REST or TUS APIs, today you can use any S3 client to interact with your buckets and files: upload with TUS, serve them with REST, and manage them with the S3 protocol. The protocol works on the cloud, local development, and self-hosting. Check out the API compatibility in our docs Authenticating with Supabase S3# To authenticate with Supabase S3 you have 2 options: The standard access_key and secret_key credentials. You can generate these from the storage settings page. This authentication method is widely compatible with tools supporting the S3 protocol. It is also meant to be used exclusively serverside since it provides full access to your Storage resources. We will add scoped access key credentials in the near future which can have access to specific buckets. User-scoped credentials with RLS. This takes advantage of a well-adopted concept across all Supabase services, Row Level Security. It allows you to interact with the S3 protocol by scoping storage operations to a particular authenticated user or role, respecting your existing RLS policies. This method is made possible by using the Session token header which the S3 protocol supports. You can find more information on how to use the Session token mechanism in the doc. S3-compatible Integrations# With the support of the S3 protocol, you can now connect Supabase Storage to many 3rd-party tools and services by providing a pair of credentials which can be revoked at any time. You can use popular tools for backups and migrations, such as: AWS CLI: The official AWS CLI rclone: a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. Cyberduck: a cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows. and any other s3-compatible tool ... Check out our Cyberduck guide here. S3 for Data Engineers# S3 compatibility provides a nice primitive for Data Engineers. You can use it with many popular tools: Data Warehouses like ClickHouse Query engines like DuckDB, Spark, Trino, & Snowflake External Table Data Loaders like Fivetran & Airbyte In this example our incredible data analyst, Tyler, demonstrates how to store Parquet files in Supabase Storage and query them directly using DuckDB: Multipart Uploads in S3# In addition to the standard uploads and resumable uploads, we now support multipart uploads via the S3 protocol. This allows you to maximize upload throughput by uploading chunks in parallel, which are then concatenated at the end. Resumable uploads is Generally Available# Along with the platform GA announcement, we are also thrilled to announce that resumable uploads are also generally available. Resumable uploads are powered by the TUS protocol. The journey to get here was immensely rewarding, working closely with the TUS team. A big shoutout to the maintainers of the TUS protocol, @murderlon and @acconut, for their collaborative approach to open source. Supabase contributed some advanced features from the Node implementation of TUS Spec including distributed locks, max file size, expiration extension and numerous bug fixes: These features were essential for Supabase, and since the TUS node server is open source, they are also available for you to use. This is another core principle: wherever possible, we use and support existing tools rather than developing from scratch. Cross-bucket transfers: We have added the availability to copy and move objects across buckets, where previously you could do these operations only within the same Supabase bucket. Standardized error codes: Error codes have now been standardized across the Storage server and now will be much easier to branch logic on specific errors. You can find the list of error codes here. Multi-tenant migrations: We made significant improvements to the running migrations across all our tenants. This has reduced migration errors across the fleet and enables us to run long running migrations in an asynchronous manner. Stay tuned for a separate blog post with more details. Decoupled dependencies: Storage is fully decoupled from other Supabase products, which means you can run Storage as a standalone service. Get started with this docker-compose file.

But for files about 5mb or less you are not going to need to change anything in your upload logic just for performance cause you won’t notice any difference probably everything mentioned here is for upload only reply fenos 1 hour agorootparentprevYou can think of the Storage product as an upload server that sits in front of S3. Generally, you would want to place an upload server to accept uploads from your customers, that is because you want to do some sort of file validation, access control or anything else once the file is uploaded. The nice thing is that we run Storage within the same AWS network, so the upload latency is as small as it can be. In terms of serving files, we provide a CDN out-of-the-box for any files that you upload to Storage, minimising latencies geographically reply Rapzid 8 minutes agorootparent> Generally, you would want to place an upload server to accept uploads from your customers A common pattern on AWS is to not handle the upload on your own servers.

There are some weird edges (well really just faff) around auth with the JS library but if nothing else they are by far the cheapest hosted SQL offering I can find so any faff you don’t want to deal with there’s an excellent database right there to allow you to roll your own (assuming you have a backend server alongside it) reply devjume 50 minutes agoprevThis is great news. Now I can utilize any CDN provider that supports S3. Like bunny.net [1] which has image optimization, just like Supabase does but with better pricing and features. I have been developing with Supabase past two months. I would say there are still some rough corners in general and some basic features missing. Example Supabase storage has no direct support for metadata [2][3]. Overall I like the launch week and development they are doing. But more attention to basic features and little details would be needed because implementing workarounds for basic stuff is not ideal.

    "title": "Hermit: Deterministic Program Execution in a Reproducible Sandbox",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/facebookexperimental/hermit",
    "originBody": "Hermit: A reproducible container Hermit forces deterministic execution of arbitrary programs and acts like a reproducible container. That is, it hermetically isolates the program from sources of non-determinism such as time, thread interleavings, random number generation, etc. Guaranteed determinism is a powerful tool and it serves as a basis for a number of applications, including concurrency stress testing, record/replay, reproducible builds, and automatic diagnosis of concurrency bugs, and more. Hermit cannot isolate the guest program from sources of non-determinism such as file system changes or external network responses. Instead, in order to provide complete determinism, the user should provide a fixed file system base image (e.g., with Docker) and disable external networking. Warning Hermit is no longer under active development within Meta and is in maintenance mode. There is a long tail of unsupported system calls that may cause your program to fail while running under Hermit. Unfortunately, we (the team behind this project) don't have the resources to triage issues, fix major bugs, or add features at this point in time. If you are interested in this project and want to make contributions, please submit a pull request. We will prioritize merging these over anything else. How it works Hermit sits between the guest process and the OS intercepting system calls made by the guest (using Reverie). In some cases, it can completely replace the functionality of the kernel and suppress the original system call. In other cases, it forwards the system call to the kernel and sanitizes the response such that it is made deterministic. As a concrete example, lets say we have a program that reads random bytes from /dev/urandom. Hermit will see that the guest opened this file (a known source of non-determinism) and intercept subsequent reads to this file. Instead of letting the OS fill a buffer with random bytes, Hermit uses a deterministic pseudorandom number generator with a fixed seed to fill in the buffer. The contents of the buffer are then guaranteed to be the same upon every execution of the program. The most complex source of non-determinism is in the thread scheduler. The way threads are scheduled by the kernel depends on many external factors, including the number of physical CPUs or other threads running on the system that require CPU time. To ensure that the threads of the guest process (and all of its child processes) are scheduled in a repeatable way, we first make sure that all thread executions are serialized so that there is effectively only one CPU. Then, we deterministically pick which thread is allowed to run next. In order to only allow a thread to run for a fixed number of instructions, we use the CPU's Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) to stop execution after a fixed number of retired conditional branches (RCBs). Read below about how to build Hermit, and you can get an idea of what it does from running examples in the ./examples folder. Building and running Hermit Hermit is built with the standard Rust cargo tool. cargo build This builds the whole cargo workspace. The actual binary is located in target directory (target/debug/hermit). Then, once you've built Hermit, all you need to run your program deterministically is: hermit runAfter that you can try running it in a concurrency stress testing (chaos) mode, or varying other parameters of the configuration such as the speed at which virtual time passes inside the container, or the random number generation seed: hermit run --chaos --sched-seed=3You can use hermit as a replay-debugger as well, either recording a non-deterministic execution (real time, real randomness, etc), or repeatedly running a controlled, deterministic one (virtual time, pseudo-randomness, etc). hermit record starthermit replay Example programs See the the examples folder for example programs and instructions on how to run them. These showcase different sources of nondeterminism, and how hermit eliminates or controls them. In order to explore more advanced examples, you can look at some of the integration tests built from ./tests/ or ./flaky-tests/. For example, using the commands below you can run a racey example multiple times to see its nondeterminism. Then run it under hermit to watch that nondeterminism disappear. Then run it under hermit --chaos to bring that nondeterminism back, but in a controlled way that can be reproduced based on the input seed. cargo build for ((i=0; iLicense Hermit is licensed under a BSD-3 clause license, included in the LICENSE file in this directory.

Hermit seems to only intercept and modify syscalls, but this is not the only source of non-determinism and randomness. For example, the layout of environment variables in memory also causes non-determinism, caused by the content of the environment variables as well as their order in memory. CPU instructions like RDTSC, RDRAND, RDSEED and similar also introduce randomness. It seems like Hermit ignores some these sources of randomness, but I can't test it, because it doesn't build on a current Arch system with the Rust toolchain from the repo. At least it seems Hermit masks RDRAND and RDSEED via CPUID, but not every program is written to support ancient architectures which didn't support these instructions and therefore not every program tests availability via CPUID. In addition, even if all of this was deterministic, CPU flags set by various instructions with \"undefined\" flags according to the CPU manual can slightly differ between different microarchitectures. A \"normal\" program should not be influenced by this, but it is still a source of non-reproducibility. This might be relevant for certain rare compiler bugs. reply planede 43 minutes agoprevI think this tool must share a lot techniques and use cases with rr. I wonder how it compares in various aspects. https://rr-project.org/ rr \"sells\" as a \"reversible debugger\", but it obviously needs the determinism for its record and replay to work, and AFAIK it employs similar techniques regarding system call interception and serializing on a single CPU. The reversible debugger aspect is built on periodic snapshotting on top of it and replaying from those snapshots, AFAIK. They package it in a gdb compatible interface. Hermit also lists record/replay as a motivation, although it doesn't list reversible debugging in general. reply eatonphil 17 hours agoprevIt's a really interesting project but it hasn't worked for non-trivial programs for me.

They are awarded to maintainers of critical free and open source projects. In 2024 four prizes of € 10 000 each will be given out. We are happy to announce the winner of the first 2024 BlueHats prize is Simon Kelley, maintainer of the dnsmasq project. Dnsmasq provides network addressing for small networks: DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot. The jury, made up of public officials from the Ministries of Education and Youth, ANSSI and DINUM, recognised the importance of dnsmasq and its ongoing development for network security. The members of the Open Source Software Council wish to continue to highlight this type of initiative: discrete projects that are critical to software infrastructures, and maintained by reliable teams over the years. In response to hearing he had won, Simon Kelley said: I'm delighted to accept the prize. Like many Free Software projects, dnsmasq started as a creation for it's own sake, but it has been kept alive and developing for a quarter of a century because of the feedback that has come from its role in the outside world, and the recognition, small and large, that it makes a difference. This prize is valuable financially, but much more so as a mark of public recognition that dnsmasq is still something that's worth doing. About dnsmasq The dnsmasq project was started in the early 2000’s by Simon Kelley. He wanted to connect his laptop to the internet via his PC. The concept of a home router was new: connecting even one computer, via a telephone line, to the internet was a luxury. To let his laptop speak to the internet, the PC had to act as go-between for all the address information. To make this happen, Simon started his own project and got it to run on his PC. He has been improving and expanding it ever since. And he has been so generous to publish dnsmasq as Free Software. There is a good chance you are using dnsmasq since it is used in many home routers, some Internet of Things devices and included in the Android mobile operating system. Dnsmasq is a popular choice because it has low system resource requirements and fits a lot of functionality into one program. It does so in about fifty thousand lines of C code. That is a low number given all the different types of devices, each with its own quirks, that dnsmasq has to talk to. Praise for dnsmasq Anyone can nominate free and open source projects for one the BlueHats prizes (and nominations are still open). Dnsmasq was nominated by Samuel Bizien-Filippi, system administrator at Pôle d'expertise de la régulation numérique(PEReN) (Center of Expertise in Digital Regulation), motivated his choice by writing: Dnsmasq is a versatile server: in a nutshell, it is both a DHCP server and a DNS proxy (that resolves domain names on local networks and internet). Dnsmasq is present in most routers (\"internet box\") and in several virtualization platforms (at least Proxmox VE). It greatly simplifies network configuration. Dnsmasq is a foundational - and overlooked - building block of networks for SMEs and public administrations. We use it at Pôle d'expertise de la régulation numérique(PEReN) (Center of Expertise in Digital Regulation). When asked how dnsmasq is used at PEReN, Filippi answered: \"At PEReN, we strive to keep all network and system configuration as code in a version control system. Since dnsmasq is configured using flat text files, it's a perfect fit for us. In our setup, dnsmasq is used: for network configuration of clients via DHCP for automated installation of systems with DHCP and TFTP (both functionality provided by dnsmasq) for local name resolution.\" BlueHats prizes for maintainers of critical software The BlueHats prize aims to place maintainers of critical open source software in the spotlight. It is a well-known problem in the free and open source world: The benefit of having open source software is enormous but there is not enough attention and resources for maintenance and maintainers. Dnsmasq is a typical example of this state of affairs. Dnsmasq is a component used in many commercial products. Some of the vendors have been willing to pay Simon Kelley for implementing new feautures but there has been no funding for maintenance. The BlueHats prizes seek to encourage users of free and open software to invest in maintenance. Nominations still open Three more BlueHats prizes will be awarded in the upcoming months. You can still nominate your favorite project for one of the € 10 000 prizes. The BlueHats prizes are an initiative of the French public administration. The French Free Software Unit (an OSPO) has partnered with NLnet to put four notable projects in the spotlight and award them the BlueHats 2024 prizes.

Mainly because I put those there. reply WirelessGigabit 14 hours agoprevDnsmasq is amazing. I spend quite the amount of time learning its config when hacking DD-WRTs. One thing that always bothered me is how hard it is to set Dnsmasq to do SLAAC but no RDNS. You see, if you set enable-ra [0], it defaults to using link-local address of the machine as the rDNS server. You can set another one by setting dhcp-option=option6:dns-server,[2001:4860:4860::8844] If you don't enable DHCPv6 that entry is used as the rdns entry. BUT... That means that if you read through this there is no easy way to prevent a DNS address from being distributed, and it is quite common to want to do that. One of the reasons is that I want my clients to use IPv4 so I can track them, but still allow them to use SLAAC (and thus privacy protections) to talk to the outside world. But if they use SLAAC to talk to my DNS, I get WAY too many addresses in there. The trick is to set: dhcp-option=option6:dns-server an empty value... Not sure if you can add the comma or not. I could only find 1 reference online: https://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/20...

    "originBody": "This story was funded by our members. Join Longreads and help us to support more writers. Andrew ChapmanLongreadsApril 18, 20243,755 words (13 minutes) At first, it was simply a roast chicken recipe. Then it was everything. I watched a man on YouTube cook the chicken, imagining what it would be like to taste it. Even if he had prepared it in front of me, I couldn’t have eaten it. Inflammation from Crohn’s disease had connected the tissues of my small intestine and my bladder together via fistula, and I did not want to pee out a roast chicken. Instead, I was on a form of artificial food called total parenteral nutrition (TPN, for short). All my nutrition and water were pumped from an IV bag into my veins through a tube in my arm. Even though I had enough functional nutrition in my body my brain screamed, you’re hungry, constantly. I watched Gordon Ramsay make French pan sauces and tuna with lime zest. I watched a man on Netflix who seemed to know nothing about food eating Khao soi in Thailand. Watching cooking shows felt like picking a scab—somehow like relief and suffering at the same time. Eventually, my wife, Erica, became concerned for my mental health. “I can’t stop. It’s a compulsion,” I would say. “I hate it,” she’d add. To diminish her concern, I settled for watching Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown, because the show’s travel element obscured the food. Crohn’s is an inflammatory bowel disease. The cause is unknown, but it appears to be due to a haywire immune system that attacks the digestive tract—in my case, the end of the small bowel. Every Crohn’s patient experiences different symptoms. Some have daily mild belly aches and unruly diarrhea. I’ve always experienced near-normal health punctuated by periods of wild pain, nausea, and weight loss. The most common treatments are steroids, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and, as a last resort, surgery to remove any bowel beyond repair. In my thirties, the combination of fresh inflammation and scar tissue from a teenage surgery had blocked up my bowel. Eating became like gambling—sometimes I won, but mostly I lost. I was diagnosed at 11. Food had become repellant to me. I remember sitting, twig thin, in an emergency room waiting area with my worried parents. A cooking show was on TV. The show’s host was making a cheese omelet that looked as appealing to me as fried fertilizer. “I can’t even look at that,” I said. “Oh? That looks good to me,” Mom said, aiming less to change my mind on the omelet than confirm to herself how sick I was. The year after I was diagnosed my doctor, worried I was losing so much weight I wouldn’t get enough calories through regular eating, put me on a nutritional therapy called enteral nutrition—an infusion of milky formula into the belly. I had to snake a flexible rubber tube up my nose and into my stomach every night, tearing it out in a rush before school in the morning. The tube would sometimes disconnect from the IV bag while I was sleeping, the pump whirring away until morning. I’d wake up drenched in sticky formula with an empty stomach. When my doctor gave me the option, I chose to guzzle the formula during the day to have extra hours without the tube at night (drinking the volume of formula required for nutrition would have been nearly impossible). I was also allowed to drink clear fluids, so my parents kept the fridge stocked with lemon-lime soda and JELL-O. But, without that shackle of a tube, I would not have stayed alive as a preteen. Doctors have used enteral nutrition since the early 20th century, pumping broths and formulas directly into the stomach either through a tube placed into the nose and down into the stomach, like mine, or through an incision in the belly. However, enteral nutrition relies on patients having a working digestive system. Doctors thought it was impossible to bypass the digestive tract and get enough nutrition into patients through a vein, believing it required so much liquid, and such a high concentration of chemical nutrients, that it would cause inflammation and burning when administered.

Longreads Newsletters Daily Updates It was Stanley Dudrick, a strong-minded surgical resident at the University of Pennsylvania, who would change that. One weekend in November 1961, Dudrick was left to look after three surgical patients. The patients had had different procedures, but over the weekend, all three died. Having watched his supervisor, Dr. Rhoads, a revered surgeon, perform technically flawless surgeries on each of them, Dudrick concluded their deaths were his fault. When he told Rhoads on Monday, he was assured the patients were all frail from their operations, and their gastrointestinal tracts were struggling to absorb enough nutrients to overcome the weakness. The patients didn’t die from his ineptitude—they died of malnutrition. A fire was lit in Dudrick. He requested leave from his surgical internship and worked out of a small lab in the hospital’s basement, determined to find a solution. For years, he honed the composition for a nutrition formula that could be delivered via veins, avoiding the intestines. By the late ’60s, he had finally found a stable mixture of water, carbohydrates, proteins, trace elements, fats, salts, and multivitamins—everything you need from a balanced meal, just with the color and smell of Elmer’s glue. But the concentrated nutrients did burn. “I’ve actually put it in my own vein,” Dudrick told Dr. Rhoads, showing his forearm. “It burns like liquid fire.” To banish the blaze, he knew the formula would have to be injected close to the heart, to allow for fast dilution around the body. When he kept a beagle named Stinky alive, nourished only with the nutrient combination infused into his vena cava (a large vein that returns deoxygenated blood to the heart), Dudrick was convinced it would work for humans. He’d invented TPN. Since then, it has saved millions of lives. A doctor once told me that when a tissue is inflamed for long enough, the connections that hold cells together start to break down, and the tissue softens. When that happens, tissues can merge, forming a little tunnel known as a fistula. A CT scan showed that my bowel had formed several fistulas looping on themselves—the path of digestion more a maze than a hallway. By knocking back the immune system with immunosuppressants and nutrition from TPN—to rest the bowel by not eating or drinking—fistulas can sometimes close themselves. This was the hope for me. A thin IV catheter called a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC—like the one Dudrick used in Stinky—was placed in a vein on the inside of my arm and threaded into my vena cava. A nurse named Stan inserted the PICC with the intense focus of a true craftsman. He wore earbuds and sang “I can’t get enough of your love” by Barry White under his breath. Since I would be sent home with the TPN, a different nurse taught me how to rig it up myself. She explained how I would set up the TPN every night and run it over 12 hours. I had to inject a personalized pre-prepared slurry of multivitamins into an IV bag, prime the pump, and flush the PICC with saline. She explained the buttons and the beeps on the pump that squirted the mixture through the tubes and into my body. Everything was vigorously wiped with alcohol because any bacteria would be injected straight into my heart. “You got all that?” the nurse asked after her demonstration. I had been preoccupied thinking about how weird not eating would be at home. Like many thirty-something married couples in San Francisco, Erica and I lived with five other tirelessly social roommates. One ran a start-up from the living room. The house was often standing room only. And what did people do when they hung around in groups? They cooked and they drank. Early on in the flare-up, the group shared a rich and earthy-tasting homemade coq au vin. I helped to meticulously peel dozens of pearl onions. I paid the price later that night. “I think we’ll be okay,” I said to the nurse. We weren’t. At home that first night, we fumbled to inject the components into the bag and attach it to the pump and my arm. Then Erica spotted a bubble marching up the tube, and we mashed at the stop button on the pump. “That’s fine, right?” I said. “I don’t know. What if it explodes your heart?” Out to the kitchen, Erica went. Polling the two dozen or so people cooking in the house, she found one doctor and one nurse to choose from. The bubble could stay; the feeding began. Early on in the flare-up, the group shared a rich and earthy-tasting homemade coq au vin. I helped to meticulously peel dozens of pearl onions. I paid the price later that night. On one of the first nights at home, Erica’s best friend visited to apply therapeutic face masks to pass the time. In a selfie with our dingy-green masks, Erica beams with sweet enthusiasm. I look stone-faced and far away. Our housemate Rory later brought some puzzles for us to do together. Everyone in the house became obsessed with them. I could hear them celebrating a discovered piece long after I snuck away to lie down. I felt weak from being sick. But I also felt weak for not being stronger, for not executing a gracious interest in the ways people tried to help. Those first weeks, I mostly slept. When I was awake, my brain was frighteningly alert. My body, on the other hand, looked and felt like wet cardboard. The anxiety of hunger settled under my ribs like the feeling you get when you’re about to burst into tears. The hum of the refrigerator alone was enough to make me want to bury my head in the backyard. I often dreamt of donuts, and once, of my sister-in-law’s mother, a tenacious Serbian woman, bringing me a roasting pan full of sausages. By the time I had my first dose of TPN, I had gone without eating for nearly a week and a half, sustained only by fluids in the hospital. Then, due to a holiday and clerical error, I was left on a dose half of what I required—intended to see how well I handled the slurry—for a week longer than expected. I assumed the hunger would subside with enough nutrition. But even after weeks on full TPN, I still could’ve eaten the plastic bags it came in. Everyone starts with around 22 feet of small bowel, but if surgery cuts it down to less than seven feet, the body can’t absorb water and nutrients anymore. With my bowel so badly matted together, surgeons might need to remove a lot, and if they removed enough—on top of the two feet I lost as a teenager—it could mean TPN for life. With the state my mind was in, that was unimaginable. While scientists have figured out extraordinary ways to keep patients who can’t eat alive, they haven’t yet figured out how to deal with what it does to us mentally. I’d been through a lot with Crohn’s before, even believing that who I was as a person was largely the result of these struggles. But TPN was different. It was like I was sitting in a lawn chair (albeit a rickety one) at a picnic when somebody came along and kicked a leg out—the pasta salad that might’ve been in my hand, flung into oblivion. Eating is an experience that humans share with all other animals. Organic material is consumed and broken down during digestion. In return, the body adapts nutritious molecules into a host of cellular processes and adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which cells turn into energy. During digestion, physiological responses are triggered in the brain by the vagus nerve, contributing to the feeling of fullness. Hormonal signals also act on the brain: leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, sends signals to the hypothalamus to inhibit hunger. In patients on TPN or enteral nutrition, leptin does increase after infusions, but it doesn’t appear to be well correlated with decreased hunger. While the hormones and neural signals are crucial to satiation, so is the sensory experience that takes place during the first phase of digestion—the cephalic phase—which begins at the sight of food. The pleasure that we take during this phase appears to be important to feeling satisfied. Monkeys on TPN continued to eat real food even when their caloric needs were met. Studies in healthy humans found that people on TPN reported being as hungry as those injected with only lactated Ringer’s, a solution designed to replenish electrolytes and fluid rather than calories. I asked an on-call gastroenterologist once what I could do for the hunger. “You can try chewing meat and spitting it out,” she said. “Oh,” I said. Of all the things doctors have said to me, this struck me as the most deranged. I never even considered her advice because I didn’t miss the taste of food, so much as I missed the social aspect and, more so, not feeling hungry. Carrying a spittoon to spit out chicken like a confused cowboy wasn’t going to accomplish either. But now I begrudgingly admit she was on to something. Chewing food, even without swallowing, helps to activate the cephalic phase, triggering a partial sense of satiation. The doctor never explained this to me. Paul Smeets, a nutritional neuroscientist at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, told me that part of the problem is that patients on enteral and parenteral nutrition receive the infusion over such a long period. “They sneak nutrition into people so slowly that the brain is never aware it’s happening,” he told me. The homeostatic feedback produced from eating a meal, that allows the brain to feel satisfied, is missing. TPN and enteral nutrition are, in effect, a form of sensory deprivation. My hunger was a natural neurological reaction that could be traced back for millennia. While on TPN, I stayed away from the kitchen as best I could, mostly because it felt as if I was gawking. In the evenings, Erica would come home from work and I’d close my laptop screen, where Bourdain was, say, fishing for dinner in southern Italy, and we’d lie on the bed. Erica would ask if I farted out my penis that day. I’d say not today, and then we’d laugh at the ridiculousness of what a good day looked like. She ended up eating less. Family members of patients on artificial nutrition often feel guilty about eating, some even lose weight, I learned. This unearthly relationship with food wasn’t what I wanted to offer her, but it was what I served, like pulling out a burnt tray of hors d’oeuvres just as the guests arrived. Even though she smiled and accepted our life the way it was, we hadn’t even been married for a year. I wondered if anything so young could thrive so undernourished. Erica would ask if I farted out my penis that day. I’d say not today, and then we’d laugh at the ridiculousness of what a good day looked like. While she was out, hidden in our room, I gorged on the cooking shows that caused her concern. In the late ’70s, doctors learned that patients on TPN often experience several stages of adaptation, including grief—mourning the loss of food rather than the death of someone close. Watching cooking shows seemed like a form of remembering and searching for what I had lost. When I tried to stop, I felt like I was from a different planet, separate from everyone else whose lives swirled around food. When watching cooking shows, I could fake being human. Since the cephalic phase of digestion begins at the sight of food, even before putting a crumb in one’s mouth, it’s also possible I was subconsciously attempting to veer onto an ancient road to satiety even if, for me, it didn’t lead anywhere. When I went looking on the internet, I found I was not alone. I asked why people watched cooking shows on the Crohn’s disease subreddit. One user said they had no idea, but “the only show I watched was Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri, which is extra weird because I was a vegetarian.” Another bought cannoli and made their partner describe the taste in detail as if it were their own personal cooking show. The things that I, and others on TPN, experienced, are not unlike the psychological effects seen in people who are physically deprived of food. In 1944, 36 men entered a study after seeing a brochure passed out at the University of Minnesota asking, Will you starve so that others will be better fed? The 36 participants were underfed until they lost 25% of their body weight. As the experiment progressed, Ancel Keys, the nutritionist running the study, noticed odd psychological effects. The participants became increasingly focused on food, collecting recipes, and taking down pin-ups of women to hang pictures of food. One even decided he would change careers and become a chef. After the study, most participants gorged themselves long after their weight returned to normal. Without food, we become preoccupied with it. Food is as evolutionarily important as pain and sex. Animals that don’t take an interest in these stimuli don’t fare well. Research shows that noticing food and remembering its location is a base instinct for all humans that becomes heightened when hungry. Patients on TPN are functionally fed but are perhaps not neurologically aware of it. Of course, physiological food deprivation is different (unimaginable, to me) from a psychological one, but we still seem to hyper-focus on what we can’t have rather than shy away from it. With the way appetite brain signaling works, Smeets says it makes sense that some overlapping effects of starvation might take place in the brain, causing an obsession with food and all the behavioral baggage that comes with it. After nearly a month without anything, not even water, by mouth, my symptoms stabilized and my doctor said I could try drinking clear liquids. Since I had tasted only the inside of my mouth for three weeks, the white cranberry juice was electrifying. I ate raspberry JELL-O in a blaze of magnificent relief. With what I now attribute to the cephalic phase the world became slightly more bearable. Then, after two months on TPN and a clear liquid diet, the home care nurse pulled the PICC. I can’t remember exactly why this decision was made, because at the time I didn’t care. I was going to be a full-time eater again. Even though I went slow, everything was a feast. Erica and I drove to her parents’ house in Southern California for Thanksgiving. I ate the turkey dinner cautiously as if it was still alive. Even then, Erica had to drive the whole seven hours back to San Francisco because I felt the familiar spasms of pain and gurgles of food going into my bladder. At the hospital, they decided the fistula likely wouldn’t close on its own. I was scheduled for surgery two days after Christmas. Since I had tasted only the inside of my mouth for three weeks, the white cranberry juice was electrifying. And so, after only three weeks without TPN, eating was out, and the PICC went back in. It was placed by two nurses who encouraged me to relax while saying things like, “Is that in? No, that doesn’t look right.” Well, you’re no Stan, I thought. Rory came to visit me in the hospital one night. “Did you know they make 3D puzzles?” he asked, passing Erica a cheeseburger that she took outside. When a nurse came in with medications on a tray decorated with red gingham, Rory stopped talking and stared. “The world is so twisted sometimes,” he said after the nurse left, laughing and shaking his head. “Who do they think they are bringing your drugs in on a French fry tray?” I’d considered this question myself hundreds of times. After Rory and Erica left that night, with the darkness outside swallowing my tiny hospital room, I opened my laptop and watched a show where hunters in Montana cooked deer ribs on a campfire. At Christmas, Erica’s family came to San Francisco because it would’ve been impossible for me to travel. They cooked Swedish and Korean food —traditions from both sides of Erica’s family. I chose to walk our dog. Humans diverge from animals when it comes to our social and cultural meaning behind food. As Sue McLaughlin, one of the authors of The Meaning of Food, said, “Like all animals, we eat to survive. But as humans, we transform simple feeding into the ritual art of dining, creating customs and rites that turn out to be as crucial to our well-being as are proteins and carbohydrates.” In addition to sensory deprivation, not eating is social deprivation. In a survey of 51 patients on enteral nutrition, most patients complained that they were socially isolated and experienced a loss of identity. What you cook, how you cook for others, and when you eat provide structure to your days and a sense of self. Food is a form of communication. Without it, you are adrift and missing a functional language. They mostly use qualitative surveys to study the impacts of nutritional therapy on patient quality of life. Even if the physiological need for food is met, there is undeniably a physical and psychological effect for patients on TPN. Up to half of patients report being constantly tired; up to one-third have anxiety; one quarter are clinically depressed. I recently found a note on my computer titled “Food to Eat,” that listed what I was craving when I was on TPN: black pepper crabs, pecan waffles, meat pies, Turkish delight, and, of course, roast chicken. I have no memory of how I came to want these particular foods. Instead, I remember all the ways my body told me something was wrong. But the hunger, the sense of loss, and the search for connection in cooking shows were a perfectly normal response, as it turns out. Maybe as close to the human experience as you can get. After the surgery, I woke up in a room on the hospital’s fifth floor that looked over the city’s tallest building, the newly built Salesforce Tower. Erica bounced as she told me the surgeon had performed a masterful operation. He removed only six inches of bowel and fixed the bladder. The surgery rescued me from any more TPN in the immediate future while nudging me ever so slightly closer to a future without food—again, relief and suffering at the same time. My surgeon came in late one evening. “I hate that thing,” he said, nodding toward the Salesforce Tower out the window. “It looks like a giant penis.” “Really?” I said. “I think it looks like a burrito.” Andrew Chapman is a science and medicine writer based in Truckee, California.

It was a bit of a traumatic time for me for other reasons, and this article gave me more insight into another dimension of it.

That's what I did when I was poor. There's a store the size of a city block a 5 minute walk away from me, there are tons and tons of food stacked up in that store, any type of food you could want, and I'm going to go bed hungry? That didn't really make sense to me. I never went to bed hungry. I respect property rights now, of course, because my belly is full. reply sethammons 44 minutes agorootparentWhen I was poor and in high school, I lived alone for a very long while in a house that my dad had started to remodel but then he got distracted by a woman and moved to her place. This meant winter in a house in the mountains literally missing a whole wall. We lived in the middle of nowhere. I hitched rides to school from friends, neighbors, and rarely family. There was no store to steal from, so I stole food from the school. I was on free lunch, so I'd steal an extra hamburger, sell it for half price to a kid for 50 cents, and I would use that to buy a can of soup when I could get someone to stop by the store. That would be my dinner that I cooked over a wood burning stove since I could warm up that bedroom but the kitchen was missing a wall and was _cold_ (between 20-40 Fahrenheit, but, again, poor, so no good warm clothes). My dad would give $20 every now and then, and I'd use that to buy potatoes that I'd heat in a toaster oven. A plain potato, a school lunch hamburger, and usually a 50ish percent chance for can of soup was what I ate. I was skinny and hungry. A few years later, I would be able to eat regularly (and now I am doing more than ok), but it took nearly two decades to be comfortable throwing out a plate of food; the poor, hungry kid in me wasn't sure when the next food would come even though I now had food aplenty. reply heavensent 2 hours agorootparentprevIf there was ever a line between sarcasm and questionable advice, this comment does a good job of walking on it. >I respect property rights now, of course, because my belly is full. reply the_real_cher 16 minutes agorootparentIt's a really strong truism though. reply riku_iki 5 hours agorootparentprevIn rich country, one likely can apply for some food stamps if can't afford food.

That thought comforts me when I feel like life is unfair or difficult. The whole thing is a bonus for me… I should be dead. Maybe similar feelings provide some comfort for people who have to manage their lives with diseases like Crohns. reply jessriedel 13 hours agorootparentOK, but note that Crohn's (and ulcerative colitis) are nearly unknown in the developing world. For reasons we don't understand, they are caused by modernity. So 90 years ago having Crohn's would be much less likely. (Symptoms from both Crohn's and ulcerative colitis don't usually present until the teens or early twenties, so this is not a case of infants with the disease simply dying early in the developing world.) reply Retric 9 hours agorootparentMild cases of Crohn’s are less likely to be diagnosed in the developing world and far more likely to be deadly when combined with something else like Malaria or TB.

Or maybe that has widespread agreement among the medical community? I'm ready to hear it, but I've gone down this road a lot with people saying things like \"just stop eating chemicals!\" or whatever. reply swatcoder 10 hours agorootparentChron's wasn't an issue I struggled with myself, but I've successfully resolved many wellness and comfort issues through personal experimentation. Science is slow in general and medical science mostly examines population-wide efficacy rather than individual efficacy, as its these population-wide conclusions that help form guidance for practicioners serving a population. For any given potential treatment or remedy, an individual may be an outlier whose specific attributes weren't represented or analyzed in that kind of research or whose response would have fallen into the noise floor. You can certainly choose to only accept those population-scale conclusions, but many of us only have so many decades to try to sort ourselves out. And further, because of the feedback loop between thought and many autonomic processes in the body, one can even experience real remedy from formally invalid treatments. For an individual, that's all you need. reply knodi123 4 hours agorootparentYeah, but the challenge is filtering those personal experiments through traps like \"regression to the mean\" and the placebo effect. And then generalizing them enough to recommend them to other people. I have no objection to personal experimentation, but the guy I responded to said he knew a cure for Crohn's that \"the man\" wouldn't let him talk about.

Give us the joy of tasting, chewing, and swallowing food, but then have it go into an external bag before it hits the stomach. reply arghwhat 13 hours agoparentUnfortunately, we also sense the mechanical filling of the stomach, and the movement through the bowels. Unless you stop the hunger altogether I don't think you'll feel satisfied without the whole process. reply mateo1 13 hours agorootparentIt's not just that. I'm pretty sure your stomach and gut also provide information regarding caloric intake, on top of other sensors detecting the raise in blood sugars/lipids/aminoacids. And even if it didn't, you'll get hungry when your body/brain detects you've switched to using reserve power. If eating doesn't satiate the hunger by providing energy, the response would likely be to make you hungrier and hungrier. reply sethammons 29 minutes agorootparentYour gut bacteria is amazing - it will signal even what kids of food it wants. By passing those hungry bacteria will eventually kill of those specific cravings I guess, but meanwhile, I'd wager a lack of satiation if bypassing the gut. reply arghwhat 13 hours agorootparentprevWell, \"reserve power\" is from starvation, intense exercise, or weird diets, not hunger. From brain perspective, \"reserve power\" would be when it ends up relying on ketone bodies, which start to be produced in higher numbers when you have been in high glucagon, low insulin condition for a longer period of time. Long enough that the liver burned through its glycogen stores and the liver cells redirect oxaloacetate to gluconeogenesis (producing glucose from stuff in the blood) to the point where the cells become unable to finish its own metabolism of free fatty acids. It then turns the intermediate products it can't use itself into ketone bodies. That part can be regulated with nutrition, glucagon and insulin, but having plenty of glucose won't replace sensations from the digestive system itself. reply mcmoor 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah I've heard that the reason artificial sweetener makes people fatter instead is that the body feels robbed when they don't get the supposed caloric intake they should get when eating something sweet. So they crave more. I actually do feel it, I still feel hungry if I eat lots of something that has little caloric value. So eating lots of vegetable and water doesn't fool my body into satisfaction. reply bluefirebrand 11 hours agorootparentprev> Unless you stop the hunger altogether My understanding is this is how drugs like Ozempic work. They make you feel fuller quicker and prevent \"food noise\" where you think about food and eating even when your stomach isn't empty reply knodi123 13 hours agoparentprevKnow what's weird to me? I don't get any pleasure out of swallowing food. Tasting, sure. Chewing, sometimes. But swallowing? Just a necessary mechanical coda, as emotionally laden as the period at the end of a sentence But if someone suggests that we enjoy an ice cream sundae, but spit each bite into a bucket? Suddenly they're a reviled heretic! reply lkuty 1 hour agorootparentReminds me that typically I prefer smelling wine that tasting it and of course than swallowing it. I often find a wine very good by smelling it and am disappointed when I taste it. Of course it also depends on the wine. I mean on average. reply sethammons 26 minutes agorootparentThat's me and coffee. Smells great, tastes like literal ash (no, not from over-cooked beans; coffee fanatics have offered me their best and it all tastes like someone filtered it through an ashtray). reply arghwhat 13 hours agorootparentprevI think the exact positive sensation differs between people. I certainly find joy in swallowing the food - which makes sense as it's a pretty important step. Tasting and chewing feels like only the precursor to eating, and taking only those steps reduce the sensation to that of chewing a bubblegum. ... But if someone has a non-bulemic reason to simulate eating, by all means go ahead. Just don't make it a big trend as we waste enough food as is. reply knodi123 10 hours agorootparentI was partly tongue in cheek. I certainly don't spit my meals into a bucket, despite being a little overweight. But I stand by what I said about not enjoying the act of swallowing. The closest I can get is the joy of not feeling hunger anymore- but that's just the absence of discomfort. I don't understand it, but I can't dispute it. reply coldtea 10 hours agorootparent>I was partly tongue in cheek. I certainly don't spit my meals into a bucket, despite being a little overweight. But I stand by what I said about not enjoying the act of swallowing. The closest I can get is the joy of not feeling hunger anymore- but that's just the absence of discomfort. You're conflating the joy of food with its mere taste. A lot of the joy (which you might just attribute to the taste part) comes as the food is digested. Not just the joy of not feeling hunger anymore, but the various chemicals making their way to the bloodstream and releasing endorphins and such. Sugar, chocolate and co for example. Even easier examples would be coffee and alcohol. Their taste is hardly the major satisfaction factor. reply sandspar 9 hours agoparentprevAristotle talks about gluttony in his book about ethics. He mentions a Greek gourmand who fervently wished to have the neck of a crane, since he felt that swallowing is the most pleasurable part of eating. reply omoikane 5 hours agoprevThe idea that taking away food also takes away what's human reminds me of Dazai Osamu's \"Ningen Shikkaku\"[1], where the narrator wrote in the first chapter that he had no idea what being hungry means, that he never understood what it means to feel hungry. People must eat to survive and thus must work in order to eat, but because the narrator never felt hungry, he does not understand how humans operated at all. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Longer_Human \"No Longer Human\" seem to be the official English title, although a more literal translation would be \"disqualified as human\". reply Night_Thastus 13 hours agoprevVery dark, but also very insightful. We take a lot of simple pleasures in our lives for granted. The feeling of stretching, scratching an itch, relaxing our muscles, sleep, the taste of food, the smells around us, feeling warmth or cold on our skin, etc. I've wondered a lot about what a life would be like without these things - even if you were otherwise completely healthy. reply rincebrain 13 hours agoparentIt can be a strange experience, to try and describe to people, something missing from your shared vocabulary. I had a number of rounds of an IV drug treatment 4 or 5 years ago, and on one and only one of them, shortly after being treated, I found myself feeling a strange sensation, one that I couldn't place, but that I definitely remembered having experienced before. After 5 minutes or so of wondering and racking my brain, I placed it. It was hunger. At some point in my early teenage years, that particular piece of wiring stopped working, and I didn't really pay much attention at the time, so I can't place precisely when, but I had no severe injuries or medical maladies crop up. The two likely causes of that are apparently a brain tumor or hormone problems, but my bloodwork and brain scans turned up nothing exciting then or since, so ...who knows. (I did, many years after this started, start drinking caffeine sometimes, but it doesn't stop happening if I stop drinking caffeine for months, so I don't think it's related. I'm not on anything stimulant-like or adjacent either.) But it's a difficult thing to explain, the absence of that - and the knock-on effects, the absence of motivation to avoid it that results, the absence of satisfaction from eating causing it to vanish. How you can sincerely ask \"why am I having a pounding headache - oh I forgot to eat for 2 days\", and not have had any sign unless you set deliberate calendar events and phone alarms to serve as a reminder that this basic feedback system is broken. (I usually don't need them, these days, because habit is a powerful thing, but I keep them around so that I don't become sufficiently sick or taxed by life that something breaks down and I forget...again.) I can't exactly offer an A-B comparison of the difference, my memories of my childhood are not clear enough for that at this point, but while I will be sad if I end up not eating something especially tasty or unusual, there's not a visceral absence of satiation in it, it's an intellectual lament. reply jamiek88 12 hours agorootparentHey this happened to me too. I never feel hunger just the effects of not eating. My thirst mechanism is messed up too. If it wasn’t for my wife I’d be a real mess. I at least eat one good meal a day because she does! If I get really, really stoned I’m talking 500 mg of thc level stoned, I can feel hunger. But that isn’t conducive to a good routine! reply arghwhat 13 hours agoprevThe post says that the TPN solution is fed slowly and that the body barely reacts. What if it was intentionally fed with periodic bursts, simulating strong blood sugar, fat and protein spikes from eating and triggering stronger insulin responses with resulting lows? I wonder if that would substantially change the experience. Maybe tuning the nutrition mixture. I vaguely remember the journey of the Soylent guy experimenting with the composition and hitting various snags along the way before he finally got to a point where it made him feel satisfied and not crave any other foods. Soylent still has the mechanical feeding sensation though... Sometimes medical developments plateau when it reaches a point of working, before it reaches the point of being good. reply rincebrain 13 hours agoparentI think the whole framing was that the reason the problem space is hard, is that if you deliver too much at once, your body notices and treats it much like if it found splinters stuck in you - invasion of foreign mass to trigger inflammatory response. reply arghwhat 13 hours agorootparentI am not sure if the burning was related to inflammation. I recall the sensation of marker fluid aburning as it moves towards the heart, but it might just be a sensation rather than a reaction. Wasn't clear from the post at least. Maybe one could burst only some convenient nutrition that is easier to deliver in higher doses like glucose, while still drip-feeding the bulkier macronutrients. Another crazy idea could be to intentionally introduce glucagon and insulin to artificially induce highs and lows. I'm sure it's a very hard problem space, but it might be one looking for a creative patient willing to put effort into further research... reply rincebrain 13 hours agorootparentThe explicit quote from the article was \"believing it required so much liquid, and such a high concentration of chemical nutrients, that it would cause inflammation and burning when administered.\", and I am assuming that the former was not just redundant with the latter. Directly mucking with glucagon and insulin for anything short of directly demonstrable life and death is going to be a fraught proposal in almost any circumstance, I would speculate, given that the risk is not just wasting away from malnutrition but much more direct tissue damage and death. (Much like I suspect something with a risk profile like Accutane's would not get approved again _now_ with the body of evidence we have for what happens if you introduce something that's \"almost, but not quite, vitamin A\" into rapidly growing bodies...) reply arghwhat 10 hours agorootparentThat was the quote describing why they originally thought that intravenous feeding was entirely impossible, which proved false, so I didn't take it as an observation regarding solution as it was later invented. It was how the original solution was invented and tested, with resistance to mucking about likely limiting it's development significantly. It is certainly not a game to entertain without understanding the signficant risks, but healthy people can intentionally take on extreme risks, so I see no reason to stop a patient with a coordinated plan for research into bettering theirs and others situation. reply Ductapemaster 7 hours agoprevThere’s an excellent Radiolab episode that ends with a similar story of someone on TPN.

I believe the museum was actually his house in Madrid. Sorolla is the master of light. His paintings are stunning[2] There are several virtual tours available online [3] [1] https://www.cultura.gob.es/msorolla/inicio.html [2] https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Cosiendo...

I wasn't sure what to expect from the city, but it might be my favorite I've ever been to. Madrid is beautiful, clean, walkable, and very welcoming. The food was all amazing and it seemed like we never had to wait for a table. I had a great time in Barcelona, but I'd recommend Madrid over Barcelona in a heartbeat. reply jillesvangurp 2 hours agoparentMadrid is indeed very nice. Perfect destination in early spring or late autumn as winters are very short there. Avoid in the summer as it gets stupidly hot there. One reason I like it is that it's far away from the beaches and package tourists. It's a huge modern city. And there's plenty to see. I love the public parks there. There's a huge new park on top of the inner ring road which they partially covered up. Perfect place to hang out on a warm day. Also did wonders for the nearby neighborhood which are now quiet and a lot less smelly than they used to be. There are a couple of other museums well worth visiting near El Prado. El Prado can get very busy because it's on everybody's list of things to visit. I've been there on a quiet day at some point and it's very enjoyable. But when you have to queue up for 45 minutes just to get in, it's probably a lot less nice. Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum has a pretty amazing collection and is right across the street. And down the street is the Reina Sofia, which has a nice modern art collection (think lots of Miro, Picasso, Dali, etc.). If you have time and a car, driving around Spain is very enjoyable. I've seen most of it's larger and smaller cities over the years. reply agile-gift0262 34 minutes agorootparent> If you have time and a car, driving around Spain is very enjoyable. I've seen most of it's larger and smaller cities over the years +1. But the train, specially being in Madrid, is a very good alternative to the car to travel around Spain. reply lentil_soup 1 hour agorootparentprevthe roads are really great, they're kept in great shape. The train, although Madrid centric is amazing as well, stupidly fast and not that expensive anymore. reply pvaldes 1 hour agoparentprevThere is stuff to see and do in Madrid for months, but Madrid is the center in a cobweb of roads. This means that maybe 40% of the country or so is reachable from here in a reasonable time. Distances in Spain are different than in US. Some cities are connected from here in an interval of less than two hours (one-way) by fast train AVE so reserving one day to explore another city as a bonus is doable with some extra work. This comprises Valencia, Salamanca, Burgos or Cordoba. You could basically go from one point to the other coin of Iberia in a day by train if you don't mind to burn a day looking at the landscape. Or sleep in the train and wake up in a different coastal city in a different Sea. Is just a question of money and planning. In the same way if you go to Barcelona I would strongly advise to explore near destinations in Pyrenees or the South of France also. reply noduerme 3 hours agoparentprevMadrid: They don't have a river, a beach or ancient ruins. What they have is a living city and people who love it. reply Xenoamorphous 2 hours agorootparentWhat about Manzanares river. reply noduerme 1 hour agorootparentSure. It's kind of a creek like the Los Angeles river. The point is that the city of Madrid is not built around rivers (like NYC or London or Prague). reply traceroute66 52 minutes agoparentprev> I had a great time in Barcelona, but I'd recommend Madrid over Barcelona in a heartbeat. The trouble with Barcelona these days is the tourists have ruined it. Both the tourists themselves, and the city itself pandering to the tourists. I avoid the place like the plague these days. reply rmason 10 hours agoparentprevI recommend Madrid as well. I still haven't made it to Barcelona but I did visit the Spanish Riviera also known as the Costa del Sol. I stayed in Torremolinos where a lot of English winter and there were a lot of American sailors in the bars as well. Its a short distance to Malaga which was interesting. Also went West and caught a boat to Tangiers in Morocco for a day trip. It was my first time experiencing culture shock. Tangiers was so different from either America or Europe. I made friends with two Danish soldiers and the three of us explored the Casbah together. It was also the first (and last!) time that I ate a sheep's eyeball! Little kids everywhere were begging for money. I understood perfectly why they spoke to me in English. But when they found out my friends were from Denmark they switched to speaking perfect Danish! These kids knew a smattering of a dozen languages or more. reply aerhardt 11 hours agoparentprevI’m glad more and more people are realizing. Preferring it over Barcelona is very personal; I completely get people who prefer a coastal city as beautiful as the Ciudad Condal. But Madrid was underrated for ages. It’s sunny, beautiful, safe, fun, imperial. Luckily it’s been booming for a while now. reply nextos 11 hours agoparentprevI also prefer Madrid, which I believe is really under-rated, but Barcelona is superb as well. Sadly, Barcelona is a bit too hyped and gentrified. It suffers from the same kind of issues SF has. Both are great in terms of access to an inexpensive talent pool. reply electrozav 2 hours agorootparentTech workers here are paid so much less than they should be; there's tons of unemployment only to earn 15k/yr when theyre at work. Salaries like this are a joke and should rise reply raverbashing 1 hour agorootparentNo, your avg tech worker is not going to be making 15k/yr. Maybe around 40k/yr and that would be an \"average\" salary for a non-senior position. reply mpeg 1 hour agorootparentWhat a weird take to defend tech salaries in Spain, I'd love to move but the very top salaries for my level cap around 80-90k EUR so it'd be quite a big drop even compared to the UK reply harperlee 18 minutes agorootparentWhere do you read a defense of anything? This is not a \"weird take\", just a statement of a fact (may it be true or false): that the average is ~40k and not ~15k (it is currently illegal to pay less than 15.876 euros per year). reply mjrbrennan 5 hours agoparentprevI loved them both for different reasons, I went last year for the first time. As another commenter said Madrid felt very imperial, and as you say was beautiful, clean, and walkable. Barcelona felt more arty and had a great coastal vibe to it. I would go back to either in a heartbeat! reply singleshot_ 9 hours agoparentprevHot in the summer. Killer nightlife. It will not take a tourist long to figure out the point of siesta. reply Xenoamorphous 2 hours agorootparentWe moved to Madrid a few years ago. Summers are incredibly long and unbearable, to be honest, and it's not getting better. We have a 2 year old daughter and it sucks not being able to take her to the park for weeks because it's scorching hot. Other than that, we like the city, and especially our neighbourhood. reply wageslave99 2 hours agorootparentprev> The point of siesta Nobody takes siestas in Spain but the elderly, children and people without A/C in hot zones in summer, and I suppose in some rural towns as well. reply dathos 33 minutes agorootparentThat’s 80% of the country you’re describing there. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t do a siesta in summer, and elderly people continue throughout the year reply pezezin 3 hours agorootparentprevI have met many foreigners from Northern countries who made fun of siesta... until they stayed in Spain for a summer, then they understood it very quickly xD reply mholm 10 hours agoparentprevI'd recommend Valencia in addition to Madrid. I can't say I enjoyed Barcelona that much, it felt too touristy. Valencia had a wonderful balance of tourism, low prices, food, and waterfront. reply nailer 10 hours agorootparentHonestly, they’re all great. Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville and Bilbao. I had almost no idea about Spain before I moved to Europe and soon realised that it is a friendly place with amazing reasonably priced food and some of the most amazing artwork. Every new city has these qualities and adds its own stories and beautiful architecture. Also Spain is to gin and tonic what New York is to pizza and Australia/New Zealand are to coffee: they did not invent it, but they certainly perfected it. a giant fish bowl of gin mare and good tonic water filled with ice and maybe some rosemary for scent. reply pezezin 3 hours agorootparentI am from Spain and your last paragraph made me chuckle. Not that long ago gin and tonic was considered an old person's drink and there were very few brands available, but 10~15 years ago it exploded in popularity. All of sudden you could find a million brands of gin and another million of tonic water, even in small villages, and bartenders started to take its preparation quite seriously. And of course I have several friends who brag about drinking it before it was cool xD reply borlanco 11 hours agoparentprevFor tips, commentary and insight about visiting Madrid, and the rest of Spain, this Youtube channel [0] is a gold mine. James and Yoly really enjoy living here in Madrid, and they explain the good and the bad of our culture and customs. No bullsh*t, warts and all.

Eventually I moved to London for work and my quality of life took a hit. reply lionkor 13 hours agoparentprevWhich time of year would you recommend? reply tgv 13 hours agorootparentSpring or autumn. Summer is simply too hot. I preferred it over Barcelona, too. reply danieldisu 13 hours agorootparentprevMarch - early June or Mid September - November Avoid July and August, horrible heat and most people have left the city reply severino 12 hours agorootparent> Avoid July and August, horrible heat and most people have left the city You mean it's bad that you don't have to wait in lines or get into crowded spaces? reply telesilla 11 hours agorootparentThere are still tourists who for some weird reason come in the worst heat. Bring a hat. reply singleshot_ 9 hours agorootparentAlso sleep during most of the afternoon. Everything is open late. reply inferiorhuman 12 hours agoparentprevI preferred Madrid as well, however as far as museums go I would make a trip to Barcelona just for MACBA. reply aba_cz 1 hour agoprevI know that not everybody has time, money, opportunity, etc. to go to Del Prado to see art with their own eyes but I have to say that seeing photos on my monitor before and seeing it in reality were completely different and not not transferable experiences. The light, those details and often even size of the canvas which is measured in meters and not centimeters are all incredible. For example Las Meninas is basically 3x3 meters or you can easily spend 1 hour looking at The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch. I will remember this visit till the end of my life. reply Animats 14 hours agoprevApple has one of those tours for their museum.[1] Apple used to be big on that. They called it \"Quicktime VR\"(1998) [2] The main application today is real estate sales.[3] [1] https://applemuseum360.com [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_VR [3] https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng/sales/int/virtualtour3d-f... reply tmilard 9 hours agoprevI may be biaised but I believe this \"tour\" is not good. Not immersive enough. Just not really something we want as client. - The moving/walking part is just bad. Even Matterport does much better with its technology. - The zooming-on-painting part is good though. The point : I am building a much more immersive technology .

That’s not to say they couldn’t do more - but it’s a very active area in many museums. reply gijsnijholt1980 2 hours agoprevIf you go there, and there’s a long queue, do not blindly join it but look for alternate entrances. reply mannycalavera42 13 hours agoprevI LOVE this I would pay for being able to rent to audioguide for a couple of days (similarly to how you can rent the audioguide during the in person visit) reply xnx 12 hours agoprevGoogle Arts & Culture has hundreds of excellent 360 museum (and other cultural site) tours here: https://artsandculture.google.com/ Separately, you can also zoom in to many artworks with extreme detail (e.g. 1000+ dpi). reply chatmasta 9 hours agoprevI was in this museum a few weeks ago. I spent three hours there before I realized I hadn’t even covered half of it. It’s huge. Highly recommend a trip. reply endisneigh 13 hours agoprevI’m curious how you produce this?

Those seem to have been done in a separate process from the visible photos. Click on the camera icon next to a piece and there is then an additional selection for x-ray view. reply raverbashing 1 hour agorootparentWell, yes you need to take the painting out for an xray view reply fastaguy88 13 hours agoparentprevI think in the intro they show a Nikon on a motorized panning head. reply thomastjeffery 14 hours agoprevIt's cool to have a virtual tour of open gallery space, but it would be orders of magnitude cooler to have a virtual tour of the works in a museum's collection that are not on view. Most museums are only able to show a few dozen or hundred works in their galleries at a time, but store thousands of works in their collection. In an effort to accommodate this reality, many museums publish a freely available database of their collection. There isn't really a standard practice for creating, maintaining, and publishing these databases, so it really depends on each museum's collections team to do that work; and it will always be a relatively low priority. Digital exhibitions could radically change that. reply chatmasta 9 hours agoparentThere’s a museum in Rotterdam called The Depot that always has all its works on exhibit and available to the public. reply thomastjeffery 9 hours agorootparentFrom Wikipedia: > The entire deposit collection of Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (more than 151,000 objects housed together, arranged in fourteen storage compartments with five different climates) is stored here and is publicly accessible, on a total floor area of 15,541 m2. That's incredible. reply chatmasta 9 hours agorootparentYou should probably have a tour guide on your first time there. Personally I was a bit confused which of the climate-controlled rooms I was actually allowed to enter (the doors all look like highly secure entrypoints).
