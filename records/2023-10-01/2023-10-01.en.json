The company challenged previous warnings. By Umar Shakir, a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge. Sep 29, 2023, 4:29 PM EDT|56 Comments / 56 New Share this story If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Onewheel at CES in 2015. Image: The Verge Future Motion, the maker of the Onewheel electric skateboard, is recalling every one of them, including 300,000 Onewheel self-balancing vehicles in the US. Alongside the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the company now seeks to remedy the products after four known death cases — three without a helmet — between 2019 and 2021. The recall comes a year after Future Motion took issue with the CPSC’s calls for recall and claimed that it tested and found nothing wrong with the Onewheels. At the time, the company issued a press release in objection to the CPSC and called the agency’s statements “unjustified and alarmist.” Now Future Motion is moving forward with a voluntary recall it chose not to do almost a year earlier. The company is asking owners to stop using their Onewheels until they take appropriate action. For the newer Onewheel GT, Onewheel Pint X, Onewheel Pint, and Onewheel Plus XR, a software update with a new warning system is the remedy. For early adopters, however, the CPSC and Future Motion are telling owners to stop using and discard the original Onewheel and Onewheel Plus. We asked Onewheel chief evangelist Jack Mudd in an email how many of the original units are affected, but Mudd refused to answer. Mudd also wouldn’t tell us why the company claimed there were no issues and publicly resisted issuing a recall back in 2022. Mudd did say that the software update for the other models is rolling out worldwide, not just in the US. Some crashes occurred due to Onewheel skateboards malfunctioning after being pushed to certain limits. The Onewheel GT, Onewheel Pint X, Onewheel Pint, and Onewheel Plus XR will receive a firmware update that will add a new warning “Haptic Buzz” feedback that riders can feel and hear when the vehicle enters an error state, is low on battery, or is nearing its limits and needs to slow down. “This update is the culmination of months of work with the CPSC,” reads the company’s recall website. Last November, it called the CPSC’s warning about Onewheels “misleading” but stated it would “work to enhance the CPSC’s understanding of self-balancing vehicle technology and seek to collaborate with the agency to enhance rider safety.” To install the update, owners must connect their Onewheels to the accompanying app and run a firmware update — the process is fully explained in a new video. For early adopters, however, owners can receive a “pro-rated credit of $100 to the purchase of a new board,” according to Mudd. The credit will only be issued after owners confirm that they have disposed of the old model. Alongside Future Motion’s blink on the decision to recall Onewheel, the company shared a new video on YouTube highlighting the new Haptic Buzz feature as well as best practices when riding. “We’ve been working closely with the CPSC for over a year in order to develop this new safety feature,” Mudd says in the video. He adds that ignoring pushback or Haptic Buzz “can result in serious injury or death.” It took engineers a while to whip up Haptic Buzz; perhaps it’s something that would not have been ready in a timely fashion after CPSC’s first whistle last year. 56 COMMENTS56 NEW Most Popular Every single Onewheel is being recalled after four deaths The Sphere’s first show looks like it was a mind-blowing spectacle ‘There’s no tracing Xbox 360 chat,’ claimed guy now charged with insider trading The synthetic social network is coming Linda Yaccarino was set up to fail Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

I think that would ground most people in reality. Fuck around enough at low speed in less-than-lethal environments, you&#x27;ll get onto a first-name basis with Newtonian Physics, and it&#x27;ll clarify, on a viscerally intuitive level, what these types of machines are really about.The first thought that comes to my mind looking at this device is \"these are failure-is-not-an-option situations\". There&#x27;s many ways to fall off a skateboard without dying, and to me it&#x27;s viscerally obvious, absolutely none of them will ever apply here. You can&#x27;t recover onto your feet, because these lithium-battery things are like 300% faster than your top sprinting speed. You can&#x27;t fall onto your arms either, because your inertial speed is faster than your autonomous reflexes. (You learn all about your autonomous reflexes). It&#x27;s just your face, and skull. This is the first thought that comes to mind: there&#x27;s no way to bail, 0% chance. It&#x27;s just completely not-an-option to fail on such a device at cruising speed. And I&#x27;m grounded enough to realize, I&#x27;m not a person who never fails physical feats. That&#x27;s not what a human is. reply parentheses 6 hours agoparent++ hard agreement here.I built my own electric longboard with enough power to throttle my hefty frame up to 25mph. It was perfectly tuned for me. I swapped out so many parts to get it just right. In the first hours of riding it, I took a fall that had me out of commission for a week. I was going 10mph!Once I got the hang of things, I used the board to commute daily for a few months - putting ~ 8 miles on it daily. To this day, I consider daily rides on this board to be the single highest life threatening risk I have taken to date. I realize that now.For anyone looking to use a board or one wheel or e-unicycle, please reconsider.All it takes is one missed sign, one pothole, one inattentive driver, one loose bushing, one nail on the road, one patch of oil. You get the idea. The number and variety of risks and significance of the damage they could do should be enough to avoid.With electric boards (not the one wheel) you need to constantly manage your center of gravity. This means if you want to break because of a hazard, you MUST shift your center of mass to lean in the direction of travel while slowing down. It takes some time to naturally manage throttle&#x2F;brake in unison with your center of mass. After 3 months of daily rides, it still required intentional planning. Just let that sink in... All it takes is one \"oh shit\" moment where you miss the transfer of center of mass. You face plant and possibly slide directly under the path of the hazard you braked for.If you still want to, get kevlar gear like motorcyclists use. Many have shoulder, elbow and back pad inserts. ALWAYS be padded and helmeted! reply zamfi 2 hours agorootparentI rode an e-unicycle (EUC) for a few years as my main mode of transport. It was super fun, and after my first year I was really quite good at it, good enough to even dodge a few cars on instinct: my response was entirely unplanned, a reflex—a sharp turn, rather than an attempt to slow down, that I was shocked my body performed in retrospect. (Turns rely on center-of-mass and rubber friction, rather than motor acceleration or deceleration, which are limited.)I loved riding that thing, it felt like flying. It was addictive. I rode it like wings, my instincts were so good it felt like I was one with it—it no longer required any intentional planning. Sure, I had my share of spills, but learned from each one where I&#x27;d messed up and how to become exceptionally careful, and was fortunate that I recovered from each in a few days.I say all this because, like you, I now realize it was the single most life-threatening risk I&#x27;ve ever taken in my life. These things you write are 100% true:> All it takes is one missed sign, one pothole, one inattentive driver, one loose bushing, one nail on the road, one patch of oil. You get the idea. The number and variety of risks and significance of the damage they could do should be enough to avoid.> All it takes is one \"oh shit\" moment where you miss the transfer of center of mass. You face plant and possibly slide directly under the path of the hazard you braked for.You are extremely exposed, and trusting your life to firmware developers.99.99% of the time it is the unbelievable feeling of flying, slicing through the wind.0.01% of the time it is slamming your body into rough pavement at 20mph, like diving face-first off a two-story building, no warning. No way to see it coming.My EUC now sits in my shed, gathering dust. reply cryptograthor 1 hour agorootparentI’ll take it if you’re in bay reply jamiedumont 3 hours agorootparentprevI’m sat here with a bunch of metal in my shoulder and a brain full of analgesia after coming off my mountain bike. I crashed at about a tenth of the speed I’d normally be going.My helmet was trashed and definitely saved my life. I’m wondering whether extra padding would have saved me from weeks of pain, a surgery and months of immobilisation followed by months of rehab.The thought of blasting down the road on a One wheel in T-shirt and jeans gives me chills now. reply ShadowBanThis01 5 hours agorootparentprevOne day I decided to ride a cheap, narrow, narrow-wheeled skateboard down a fairly steep access road that led to a beach parking lot where I grew up.At some point during the descent, the board started to shimmy violently, forcing me to jump off... but I was already going faster than I could run. But run I did, and my feet and legs literally fell behind my torso... upon which I fell and skidded down the asphalt, shirtless. I did manage to keep my chin up and off the pavement as I slid, however.It was night-time and we were at the beach with some relatives. I gritted my way through playing in waves and showing my relatives around. Nobody noticed anything. When we got home and I walked into the light, my mom gawked at the shredded skin on my chest and, being a woman of considerable decorum, did NOT shout \"WTF!!!\" But that was definitely the nature of the response. reply wlesieutre 12 hours agoparentprevVideo of what nosediving off a one wheel looks like courtesy of Adam Savage: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;donttrythis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1205621915877961729&#x2F;Couldn’t say if that was a power loss issue or the wheel just got too deep in the mud, but doesn’t look fun especially if you imagine that fall on to concrete. reply conductr 8 hours agorootparentHe’s probably going about 1&#x2F;4 of this things top speed too.I’ve had this same thing happen on a electric skateboard at about this speed but on asphalt. Shoulder dislocated, elbow broke, wrist sprain so severe I had to relearn how to use my hand. And I was a skateboarder my whole life leading up to that so I knew how to take a fall.I still use electric bike and fat tire scooter&#x2F;bike. But the high speed even on that feels sketchy. All it takes is a little gravel or something and you’ll lose your front wheel and eat it hard. That actually happened to a friend growing up, we were flying down a steep hill (ok maybe 20mph) on our BMX bikes. He hit gravel and the front wheel slid out. He had to have his upper lip stitched back on. reply 0xbadcafebee 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd you&#x27;ll notice that he successfully plants his left foot, but momentum just carries him ahead and into the fall and roll. And this is a best case scenario.\"The deaths came as a result of head trauma, with at least three of the accidents happening with the rider in a helmet.\" reply rwc 11 hours agorootparentWhere are you getting that quote? The article seems to contradict that:\"Alongside the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the company now seeks to remedy the products after four known death cases — three without a helmet — between 2019 and 2021.\" reply albedoa 7 hours agorootparentI was confused too. The only google result for that quote besides that comment is the following article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;popculture.com&#x2F;trending&#x2F;news&#x2F;onewheel-self-balancing... reply eddythompson80 8 hours agorootparentprevYou probably need a motorcycle helmet to stand a chance reply dddrh 7 hours agorootparentI see someone riding one of these around my neighborhood in what is essentially full motorcycle gear: - full helmet with closed visor - armored jacket with elbow pads - knee pads - all high visStill doesn’t look like it’s enough while they cross a street in front of turning cars. reply TylerE 7 hours agorootparentprevMotocross, even. Chin protection isn’t a focus of standard motorcycle helmets. reply dharmab 1 hour agorootparentIt is a standard feature of an ECE, FIM or even Snell rated helmet. Even modular helmets have the same chinbar testing as full face helmets.I can&#x27;t speak for DOT helmets, since that standard is untrustable for a variety of reasons anyway. reply HarryHirsch 10 hours agorootparentprevHe hopefully wasn&#x27;t expecting to stop himself like that, that looks painful, it&#x27;s asking for a sprain! But what a nice roll, does the fellow practice judo? reply otteromkram 7 hours agorootparentHe does!Actually, Adam recently achieved the scared third-degree black belt, which makes him a master of Suk-Hyeon-Deisu reply duxup 7 hours agorootparentprevAt a faster speed I’m not even sure you could soften the crash with your arms much at all. reply nh2 5 hours agoparentprevGerman computer magazine c&#x27;t reviewed the \"Hoverboard\" in the past.I liked the article because its opening page was a full A4 x-ray image of the editor&#x27;s broken arm.A small version can be seen on: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heise.de&#x2F;news&#x2F;Explosionsgefahr-US-Rueckruf-einer...I will be indefinitely grateful for his sacrifice to protect my health. reply klyrs 14 hours agoparentprevDuring my brief stint with longboarding, I found that tumbling (as taught in gymnastics, martial arts, parkour, etc) is quite useful for a high speed unplanned dismount. That would be applicable here too. However, my stint with longboarding was brief because less than 100% of crashes led to a successful tumble. reply jeffalyanak 13 hours agorootparentIf you are riding with good posture and awareness it you can run out and roll from a one-wheel.You might not be able fully \"run it out\" given the speed, but every step you take when bailing is a good thing and rolling out after you take a few steps will help as well.At the end of the day, it&#x27;s obviously going to be more dangerous than a bike or a scooter, though. My issues with future motion is more to do with their extremely poor response to design flaws, though.I think that riding at more reasonable speeds and riding with focus and awareness is still reasonable, but the faults we&#x27;ve seen add hidden risks that are difficult to address as a rider. reply grogenaut 10 hours agorootparentThat might be true unless your knee buckles or foot sticks blowing out your knee, acl, mcl, cartilidge which happened to me at 9mph. Luckily I only sprained the MCL for the 3rd time. reply thot_experiment 12 hours agorootparentprevWait what? I mean I agree about being able to fractionally run it out (I spilled at full speed when i first rode one of these and came out mostly fine because of a decade of skating) but there&#x27;s no way that these are more dangerous than bikes or scooters. There are way more ways to get tangled&#x2F;impaled (not usually literally, but more ways to have crash force concentrated in a smaller area) when crashing a bike&#x2F;scooter. reply avianlyric 12 hours agorootparentScooter I can kind of see the argument for. But bike not so much. Assuming we’re talking peddle bikes here, then they’re naturally self stabilising, and capable of far heavier breaking than a One Wheel is.A One Wheel requires quite a lot of active balance from the user, a bike requires some balance, but hard cornering on a bike, or slamming the breaks on hard don’t generally result in unplanned dismounts, even with amateur bike riders. A One Wheel on the other hand, even experienced riders will still end up doing unplanned dismounts when performing rapid unexpected manoeuvres (such when avoiding another vehicle or pothole).It’s only anecdata, but I’ve personally never had a serious unplanned dismount on a bike (after thousands of hours), and includes while mountain biking. I’ve have had a couple of nasty unplanned dismounts on a One Wheel just riding around a park. I suspect broader stats (assuming anyone’s even collected them) would probably find that my experiences of each mode of transport is pretty representative. reply thot_experiment 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a fair point, in terms of the odds of an incident being bad I would say scooters and bikes are more dangerous, but the odds of an incident happening at all on the onewheel is much more likely . reply avianlyric 8 hours agorootparentI think I would agree that you can probably have a much worse incident on bike vs a One Wheel. A bike allows you reach effectively unlimited speeds (provided you can find a big enough hill and tail wind), which brings with it uncapped risk.But I think for most average bike riders, people who just ride a bike to get from A to B, rather than for sport (more speed always means more risk, at certain point I agree a bike becomes inherently more dangerous just due to the higher speeds). The odds of them having a bad incident on a bike is much lower than on a One Wheel. It’s quite hard to have an incident on a bike that results in a guaranteed head injury (please wear a helmet, it only takes a single bad head injury to ruin your life), whereas it’s quite hard to avoid a head injury from a One Wheel incident. Most bike related incidents (where someone isn’t just riding into a stationary object, in which case I don’t think the mode of transport matters much) result in the bikes wheel slipping out from under you, the consequence is moderately slowed, but quite painful fall sideways. The time it takes the bike to fall out from under you gives you a bit of time to prepare for the impact. All this assumes reasonable low speeds (not much faster than a run), due to non-sport based riding.On a One Wheel or similar, dismounts tend to result in full bodied face plants. If you’re not able to come of the device, and catch yourself by running, then you tend to go face first to the pavement, and there’s nothing slowing you down. No bike frame or similar sliding across the ground and buying you time, just a whole load of empty air between your head and the ground. reply ClumsyPilot 9 hours agorootparentprevOnewheel flios, your head huts the ground. Hitting the ground with your head us rare in a bicycle reply Gibbon1 10 hours agorootparentprevBeen a long time and the link is lost but I saw a California DOT study that had Italian style scooters as dangerous as bicycles. It&#x27;s at odds with what motorcyclists think. Also at odds the risk from motorcycles goes up sharply with displacement.My personal experience was all dismounts from bicycles lead to bruises if that. And friends crashing at high speed tend to end up with hand and wrist injuries. Flip side I have three friends that needed knee surgery after stand up scooter accidents.So I agree the typical dismount is really important. reply dharmab 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been on a motorcycle that had the drivetrain cut out at 80mph. The bike coasted safely to a stop.You lose drive power on a one wheel and your biology is immediately meeting physics. reply cdelsolar 10 hours agorootparentThe wheel doesn’t have inertia? reply jwiz 10 hours agorootparentThe motor is holding the nose up. When you lose power, the nose immediately dives into the ground, stopping the onewheel, but not the rider. reply wolverine876 7 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s really unbelievable - an unacceptable mode of failure. How are they not in jail or sued to oblivion? What engineer put their name on it? reply thinkmassive 8 hours agorootparentprevIf the rider is actively balancing then it doesn’t need to immediately nosedive. In reality that’s the usual effect, but keeping a low center of gravity and trying to keep it balanced go a long way toward a smoother slide&#x2F;roll instead of a faceplant. reply johnmaguire 7 hours agorootparentThe rider leans forward to accelerate the OneWheel, so they are not \"actively balancing\" - the OneWheel self-balances \"against\" their lean. Until the motor gives out, that is. reply Aeolun 10 hours agorootparentprevI suspect it has more to do with the active balancing on the thing stopping from one moment to the other. You’d just tip forward before you can react. reply catiopatio 10 hours agorootparentprevIt’s very rare that bicycle is going to mechanically fail and send you flying.Short of the time I was hit by a car, I’ve never had a bicycling emergency — road or mountain — that I wasn’t able to walk away from through some combination of hoping obstacles and&#x2F;or putting the bike down in a controlled side-skid. reply seanmcdirmid 10 hours agoparentprevHeck, just try skiing or snow boarding. I could never get over my fear of Newtonian motion, even with soft powder to make falling less dangerous, there were always just too many trees around.Roller blades and ice skating are similar before you learn braking. I used to get Aron d on my rollerblades a lot, in a time before helmets were more common. reply RajT88 6 hours agorootparentBoth are far more forgiving than skateboarding, even given the speeds you&#x27;re sometimes wiping out at.You just sort of bounce down the slope, and it hardly even scuffs up your snow gear.Wipe out at a quick on a skateboard - the pavement has no give, and you&#x27;re not all bundled up because it&#x27;s summer. You&#x27;re getting road rash, minimum, maybe some more serious damage to bones, head, etc.Rollerblades, not quite as bad. They aren&#x27;t constantly trying to run away from you. Similar failure mode though. reply beezle 8 hours agorootparentprevRide in the middle of the run to avoid the trees! Falling on hard pack is an excellent way to jolt yourself awake ;) In any event, carving at high speed keeps your body pretty close to the snow. reply outrun86 5 hours agorootparentWas high speed carving a couple of years ago. Blew a turn and rag dolled. Broke 2 vertebrae in my neck and two in my back. Fractured the back of my skull. Speed + impact can get intense. reply gnicholas 3 hours agorootparentWhat I like about snowboarding is it feels fast, even when you&#x27;re going not-that-fast (at least in my case). I once had a friend video me coming down the hill, and when I watched the video, I thought: wow, I thought I was going much faster than that! reply momirlan 10 hours agorootparentprevcross-country skiing is not that bad. reply rsync 12 hours agoparentprevWait wait … wait…You’re telling me people were buying and using these without knowing how to skateboard first?I thought every single person I saw using these were, at the very least, passable skateboarders … reply buffington 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been an active skateboarder, snowboarder, and surfer for 25 years, and have ridden a One Wheel XR for about three years.All are different in terms of most of the skills needed to do any of them.The One Wheel is much more like a snowboarding in soft powder than it is like skateboarding, but even then, it&#x27;s not quite the same. There&#x27;s a sort of softish center pivot feeling, where on a snowboard it depends on where your edges are.Skill wise, you don&#x27;t need any to make the One Wheel do what&#x27;s advertised. You do need skill to ride it confidently, but you gain those skills as you use it.I&#x27;ve had one very bad fall on the One Wheel, and it was bad. It slide out while going fast down a steep slippery&#x2F;sandy hill, and then nosedived, which sent me cart wheeling, then whipped my heel into the ground, shattering it into 23 pieces. I was in bed for 6 months, and didn&#x27;t walk without help for 12.I actually think my other boarding skills made the injury worse. I reacted as if the board was a skateboard, where a sideways slide is something I&#x27;m super comfortable with and do on purpose. That reaction was to lean deep, counter to the forces of the slide. The big fat gripping tire of the One Wheel bit in, then acted as a fulcrum with my body as the lever, and I just went sailing.The advice from the GP to have One Wheel-curious people try a skateboard first is indeed good advice. It won&#x27;t teach you how to ride a One Wheel, but it will teach you how hard the ground is. reply thinkmassive 8 hours agorootparentAnother good option for new riders is to learn to use a balance board first (like a Vew-Do). At the very least, step on the Onewheel while it’s powered off, slowly raise it to level and hold, then alternate slowly setting down each end and returning to level. If you can do that, you can recover from some situations that would otherwise result in a nosedive. reply fendy3002 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd another important one: braking. Something that has wheels and can move from inertia will need some mechanism to brake, and to emergency brake, especially on inclined &#x2F; declined paths. reply buffington 8 hours agorootparentI agree braking is important, but I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s relevant to my comment.All the board sports, I mention, including the One Wheel, have braking.Skateboarding: your feet or power slides are your brakes. I guess your tail too, if you don&#x27;t mind it splintering away.Snowboarding: your edges.Surfing: not really applicable, though you can stall by putting all your weight on the tail.One Wheel: leaning back.In my experience, the One Wheel is as effective at stopping quickly, or even more so, than skateboarding or snowboarding. reply wkat4242 12 hours agorootparentprevHere in Barcelona these things are super common. The riders seem to be pretty adept. The problem is more that they don&#x27;t care about pedestrians, they zoom around while on their phones on the pavement where they&#x27;re not allowed and zip around pedestrians way too fast.I don&#x27;t care if they kill themselves but they&#x27;re risking other people&#x27;s safety more. reply RajT88 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s like this in San Francisco too. And Chicago.Heck, I saw a middle aged guy in a forest preserve on the trails with one taking some work conference call. reply dzdt 11 hours agorootparentprevI have and ride a onewheel but never skateboarded. It really is a different balance; one-wheeling hasn&#x27;t helped me a bit for skateboarding skills either.My take on the safety bit is I would never ride the one-wheel at the top speed the device supports, and would never ride without a helmet or on a road with traffic. It can and will dump you. I&#x27;ve had the battery-out dump (when I knowingly experimented after its low power warnings). Basically if you go faster than you can run out&#x2F;step and roll out from you&#x27;re inviting yourself trouble. reply flagrant_taco 10 hours agorootparentprevI know a few people that bought these to commute around town. I always thought they were bat&#x27;s hit crazy and did try, unsuccessfully, to talk the out of it.I skateboard when I was younger and generally feel comfortable enough on any board where I can stand sideways. No way in hell I wanted to try these though, the top speed alone masks me way too nervous even with experience skateboarding, surfing, and wake boarding. reply nebula8804 6 hours agoparentprevA few years ago there was this video floating around of a guy flying off an electric skateboard: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z7lO4yV-eQkWhile the physics of what happened make sense, it still looks so unreal. reply bombcar 14 hours agoparentprevThink how many times a toddler entertains the carpet with his face whilst learning to walk and run - years of training is involved in us walking normally.You need similar training to learn these other devices which can operate VERY unexpectedly compared to normal balancing. reply thot_experiment 12 hours agorootparentThe gamut of human capability when crashing vehicles is SO MUCH larger than most people realize. The average bike commuter probably has a much higher chance of injury in a solo crash than someone who&#x27;s skated for decades on a onewheel. When I see discussions of safety I rarely see \"get good at crashing\" brought up, but it&#x27;s such an important skill.When I ride my bike I&#x27;m always hopping up curbs at speed, doing quick whip skids&#x2F;ted shreds etc, not just because it&#x27;s fun, but because those are the skills you need to stay alive in abnormal situations. It&#x27;s honestly kind of baffling to me that most people don&#x27;t actively work on expanding their safety envelope.You can get good at crashing, and at avoiding crashes, and when you do you can either do the same things safer, or do more fun things with the same level of safety. This is why Alex Honnold isn&#x27;t dead (yet). reply Symbiote 7 hours agorootparent> When I ride my bike I&#x27;m always hopping up curbs at speed, doing quick whip skids&#x2F;ted shreds etc, not just because it&#x27;s fun, but because those are the skills you need to stay alive in abnormal situations.I&#x27;ve cycled to work for 15 years, and I&#x27;ve never hopped up a kerb and I don&#x27;t even know what a whip skid &#x2F; ted shred is. reply jamiedumont 3 hours agorootparentI used to commute through London by bike. Like the cliche I was I ended up riding a fixie (everything else either got stolen or broke).I found through trial and error that riding aggressively was safest, not because it was inherently safer but because everyone would take note of the idiot hooning around too fast and take extra caution. Of course the failure mode here is when someone doesn’t notice you…Years later I now commute by bike in Cornwall where the local population is ignorant of cyclists. I ride an electric cargo bike with my son on the back and I’m incredibly conservative.There’s no real difference in incidence of accidents, but incidence of “near-miss” and severity of possible accident?

Falling from a skateboard should be no different from falling from a standing position in terms of the time it takes for your head to hit the ground. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentYour head and feet are moving at the same speed. Very fast. The board leaves you behind by stopping. You now put one foot on the ground. Because of friction, your foot stops and goes flying behind you before you can put your next foot on the ground or apply any meaningful weight to it. Because your foot was thrown backwards, it applies angular momentum to your body and you begin spinning around your center of mass (aka, falling forward). Less than 100ms has passed at this point. In the best case, your other foot is impacting the ground, right now, directly under you. But it can&#x27;t take your weight before it has flung behind you and adding to your angular momentum, forcing you to go face first. It is at this point, you are capable of realizing you are going to fall face first. You have ~80ms to realize this, and put your arms up, before impact. Even if you have amazing reflexes, an impulse isn&#x27;t reaching your muscles in less than 40ms, that means you need to move your arms from &#x27;keeping balance mode&#x27; to &#x27;defensive mode&#x27; (including applying resistive power to keep them there) in less than another 40ms.

The only legitimate issues I’ve seen are caused by sensors (either the foot sensor itself, or improper mounting usually related to grip tape) or water damage.A Onewheel attempts to self balance. To accelerate, you lean the direction you want to go. As your speed increases, the board starts tilting the nose up to signal it’s reaching its limit. Powering the motor requires energy, and self-balancing requires additional energy beyond that, so a safe amount of headroom needs to be reserved to accommodate for variations in terrain and rider movements.When the noise starts tilting up, there’s nothing to stop the rider from leaning forward more, which also signals to accelerate. This is called “pushing through pushback” and it’s required to go more than ~16-18 mph.Imagine the extreme case where you quickly lift your rear foot off the board. Obviously it’s going to stop suddenly, and you’ll fly through the air and smash into the ground. Every nosedive is exactly this scenario, just slightly less extreme.Once I grasped this simple concept it became obvious that every fall was my own fault. This is why I recommend new riders practice balancing with the board powered off. If you can’t easily do that, you have no business pushing through pushback.The boards being “fixed” by this recall are getting a new feature that makes the board vibrate at high speeds. This is done by modulating the motor, it requires no new transducer. The only “failure” is of the rider being oblivious to the signal the board is sending.Source: own a V1, Plus, and GT; ridden thousands of miles on my own and other’s boards; ran a meetup and met a huge variety of rider types; once raced in the GoPro Games; crashed hundreds of times including the obligatory bone-breaking incident resulting in surgerytl;dr: Future Motion is anti-consumer, haptic feedback is overdue, but there’s nothing inherently wrong with the Onewheel. Every nosedive is ultimately due to rider error. reply thinkmassive 12 hours agorootparentI’ll also point out that I’m a FOSS fanatic, and I completely agree that single-wheeled self-balancing boards will gain increased reliability and performance thanks to the VESC community openly sharing their progress.This is orthogonal to riders accepting they’re participating in a fun but very dangerous board sport. reply Dwewlyo 13 hours agoparentprevYou still would ride something which can&#x27;t work if a hal sensor fails or a battery or anything else.It&#x27;s not like a bike or E-Bike.I have no clue how you look at this and don&#x27;t think &#x27;death trap&#x27;s or &#x27;stupid way of dying &#x27; reply mongrelion 14 hours agoparentprevI ride electric unicycles and I have a question about these OneWheels: when you are rolling, the wheel self balances, right? And when you are reaching the power limitations of the board, does it let you know of this in any way? The EUC will either tiltback (the wheel will literally stop you from leaning even more, so you are forced to lean man) or it will beep very loudly for several seconds, before it finally cuts off either because you fried the board or because the wheel is protecting itself. reply thinkmassive 7 hours agorootparentIt has a very obvious pushback effect. I haven’t ridden an EUC, but I suspect the difference is you only have part of each foot as leverage to counteract it, so the device can more easily counteract the rider trying to push through it. Turn the rider sideways with each point of contact about a foot out from center, combined with a much smaller tire and lower wattage motor, and it’s easy for the rider to counteract it all the way to the system’s limit.Then again I’ve seen videos of EUCs doing nearly double the top speed of a Onewheel.It’s all relative to the rider’s ability and willingness to continue stomping the accelerator as it increases in resistance. reply eknkc 13 hours agorootparentprevIt has a tilt back feedback. However it is possible to miss it and there is not much buffer after you hit the feedback point.I believe they just released a new firmware along with this recall and they have added something new. Might be vibration or sound but I can&#x27;t remember exactly what. reply thinkmassive 7 hours agorootparentYes that’s correct, the firmware update is to provide haptic feedback by modulating the motor to cause vibration. It sounds like a great idea, hopefully it works well. reply bredren 6 hours agorootparentThe idea of sound + vibration notice of porential power related shutoff was requested openly and repeatedly at least since 2019.If this is such an innovative and important feature, there is no reasonable way to explain why it took the company so long to release it.Here’s the announce copy from their email on the update:“Today we&#x27;re releasing an innovative new safety feature called \"Haptic Buzz\".

Or is the maintenance a bit much for a daily? reply sleepybrett 15 hours agorootparentYeah it&#x27;s got wide tires (and they are pretty small in diameter as well) and it&#x27;s a stepthrough with an awfully heavy frame. I might go with something like the radcity if I were going to commute daily. Currently that commute is only 6ish miles though and I&#x27;m still mostly WFH, so it&#x27;s not as critical.Rad does consider it a commuter bike, I just consider it a tad non-optimal but not anything terrible. Great for neighborhood errands though. My neighborhood &#x27;main drag&#x27; is great for a little shopping&#x2F;eating but is about a mile and change away so it&#x27;s certainly walkable but I wouldn&#x27;t want to lug groceries a mile up a hill so the bike is perfect. Haven&#x27;t touched my car all summer unless I was getting out of the city.It is a bit small. I think they rate it for people who are 5&#x27;10\" max, which is my height to get full leg extension. While it does fold it is quite heavy so if you are thinking about a scenario where you drive the edge of the city and bike the rest of the way in just know that getting it in and out of a trunk is a bit of a wrestling match.Maintenance-wise, no big complaints in almost a year and a half.

The problem with scooters and e-bikes, even folding ones, are that a lot of buildings will not let you take them indoors. Or most will have you use a freight elevator, which is operated manually AND has set hours that it’s run.There’s also the difficulty of storing&#x2F;locking them if you go out for dinner or some other event. Something as small as a Onewheel that you could pick up and walk with, and is small enough to store under a table, or take on a train without blocking anyone is a dream in this sort of environment.Edit: I should also note that I’m speaking from my very NYC perspective. reply hackernewds 16 hours agorootparentAre there other alternatives to One wheel that work?

Adding a motor to a longboard is just enhancing a known proven quantity. It won&#x27;t have the maneuverability of a onewheel or the all-terrain ability, but longboards are definitely a proven vehicle for roadways so motorized ones seem fine.Maybe there&#x27;s some variation of the kickscooter that can meet the portability and compactness of a onewheel. Something that focuses on the foldability of the old Razor scooters. But that still wouldn&#x27;t be as convenient.Fundamentally, the onewheel seems like a personal-mobility answer to the V22 Osprey: a vehicle with amazing functionality and versatility in its happy path, but is fundamentally unsafe in failure because of the basic physics of the situation.edit: onewheel, not longboard, in the final paragraph. reply mgaunard 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy can&#x27;t you keep your bike outside like a normal person?Attach it to a pole or whatever. reply roboror 14 hours agorootparentTheft & rust. reply gnicholas 6 hours agoparentprev> why I lost enough trust in the board to get rid of it.If you sold it or gave it away, did you tell the new owner about this defect? reply cjrp 16 hours agoparentprevDid the wheel lock-up, or was it more like a blip of power-off then back on again? reply scrose 16 hours agorootparentThe board would completely disengage and the nose would drop.

MOBILE PSA: Some Pixel owners still can't dial 911 during an emergency Reports have continued to emerge over the past months that some Pixel phones have issues with emergency calling. By Aamir Siddiqui • September 11, 2023 Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Users continue to report various issues with calling 911 emergency services on several Google Pixel smartphones. These incidents have continued to occur after a possibly related bug was highlighted and fixed in January 2022. Back in late 2021, reports had emerged of a weird bug on Google Pixel devices that would render them unable to connect to 911 emergency services. The issue was traced to Microsoft Teams, and both Google and Microsoft issued fixes in early 2022. But it seems that 911 calling is still somewhat randomly broken on Google Pixel devices, and some users are finding this out the hard way. Redditor /u/TonyStamp595SO found themselves in an unfortunate situation where they needed to connect to emergency services immediately. They tried dialing 911 from their Pixel 7, but the phone failed to connect. The phone would keep dropping the call within a second of pressing the call button, which occurred for three attempts. The Redditor tried dialing from their Pixel 6 Pro next, and it connected immediately, and the emergency was handled. This incident by itself is harrowing. But as it turns out, Redditor /u/10-1-100 compiled over 20 such reports last year. The real kicker is that these reports exclude reports older than 2022, as that would include a publicly acknowledged bug that was subsequently “fixed.” The compilation was last updated in January 2023, so there may be other reports that have not yet been highlighted between then and now. We do not know the real reason behind this 911 calling bug on Pixel devices, even though general call dropping is a commonly reported problem on the Pixel 7 series. There is no indication that this bug is still connected to Microsoft Teams. There are plenty of variables across the reports, ranging from different carriers to Wi-Fi calling. What is common in these reports is that the device is a Google Pixel smartphone. To clarify, this bug does not occur on all Pixel devices. Many users report expected behavior when contacting emergency services. However, for these unfortunate reports highlighted above, the phone did not reliably connect to emergency services when it was really needed. We’ve contacted Google for a statement and to learn more about the issue. We’ll update this article when we hear back from them. In the meantime, you can try to schedule a “test” call to confirm that emergency calling is working on your Pixel smartphone. Remember that you may or may not face issues even after a successful test. How to schedule a “test” call to ensure that 911 emergency calling is working on your phone According to 911.gov (the official website for the National 911 Program in the US), you can schedule a test call to check whether your Pixel smartphone can successfully place a 911 call. However, a test call is different from directly calling the emergency service! Do NOT directly call 911 for non-emergency \"test\" calls. Please schedule a call by contacting the non-emergency phone number first. Instead of directly calling 911, you need to schedule a test call with your local 911 call center by contacting its non-emergency phone number. The website advises visiting the National Association of State 911 Administrators site. Select the state where you live. This will show you the details of your 911 administrator. Contact the administrator to find out the non-emergency number of your local 911 call center to schedule a test call. Call the non-emergency number to schedule a day and time for a test call. Make the test call during this scheduled slot only. If you know or can locate the non-emergency phone number of your local PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point), you can inquire with them to schedule a test call without needing to route through the 911 administrator.

I put a complaint in with my carrier but nothing was ever done. And of course Google could give 0 fucks with their customer support.A few months later, I needed to call 911 for an emergency and it did work, but yeah... we got \"Eventual Consistency\" for an emergency. reply radicaldreamer 14 hours agoparentSomeone could put all of these reports together along with the paper trail of unresolved complaints to Google through discovery and likely end up with a great class action case or even a criminal negligence case.911 is one of those things that absolutely must work and most phones will allow you through using any available network if you are out of range of your primary carrier.The fact that this is unreliable on any mobile phone is completely unacceptable. reply simfree 9 hours agorootparent911 obviously doesn&#x27;t have to work given the blatant disregard Google has had for 911 performance over multiple phone generations. I consistently had 911 calls fail on my Pixel 6, which led me to get rid of that device.Some Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) also give zero shits about call answer time, NG911, 911 via text, or even consistently working E911.E911 provides a static address to the public safety answering point when a 911 call comes in. NG911 enriches this with more accurate latitude longitude and height above ground level data, or for phones that are in a fixed location a room number or extension number can be provided to make it much easier for a routing emergency services.We need a national system for 911, not this mishmash of 10 to 30-year-old proprietary systems serving the 5700 PSAPs put together for each department on a township, city or county basis, with minimal coordination across regions and states. reply KirillPanov 47 minutes agorootparent> 911 obviously doesn&#x27;t have to work given the blatant disregard Google has hadRevoking all of their FCC approvals will fix this problem, and right quick.Use of the PCS cellular spectrum is conditioned on several things; spectrum purchase by a carrier is necessary but not sufficient. Correctly-functioning emergency calling is one of the other conditions. reply TerrifiedMouse 15 hours agoparentprev> A few months laterI’m surprised you kept the phone. I would have gotten a new phone if I discovered my current one couldn’t dial 911 properly. reply prmoustache 13 hours agorootparentWell, how many times in your life do you call 911? I am in my forties and I maybe used my local equivalent 3 times and in every occurence someone else could have made the call.And I&#x27;ve only used my mobile phone since my late 20&#x27;s, it is not like I buy smartphones for emergency purposes. reply kmlx 13 hours agorootparentyou only need it to fail once… reply clnq 9 hours agoparentprevMy colleague once told me that the reason telecom providers took so long with Android software updates was because they had to verify that the phone meets regulatory requirements after the update. One of these requirements was being able to dial 112 (Europe&#x27;s 911) very thoroughly. There was a legally prescribed process (by BNetzA, IIRC) for doing that in Germany. After a quick Google search, it seems like there is something like that mandated by the FCC in the US.I wonder how the Pixel 4 passed it. Not just in the US, but in many countries. reply simfree 9 hours agorootparentThe Pixel 4 probably reliably called 911 on the simplest network config, like GSM or CDMA, but when encountering WCDMA, VoLTE and all the fun ways you can configure these technologies, you ended up with situations where the phone would perhaps have data service, but no ability to dial 911.T-Mobile has had manufacturers brick band 12 on phones like the Moto E because you would get rural data coverage with this band, but T-Mobile did not sell any Moto phones and did not want to write a software config for VoLTE for Motorola phones. Without band 12 enabled the phone will happily roam onto AT&T or Verizon in areas where T-Mobile doesn&#x27;t offer GSM service instead of hanging out on a cellular network that can never provide calling or texting at that location. reply freitzkriesler2 13 hours agoparentprevSend a complaint to the FCC. The carrier will notice. reply bufio 13 hours agoparentprevSoftware is a mess. reply jpk 7 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re down-voted because you kinda stopped short, but I think it&#x27;s worth discussing: Many engineering disciplines deal with safety-critical stuff and often have robust process around validation of design and implementation as a result. There&#x27;s heaps of non-safety-critical software written, and if the same processes, attitudes, and even personell, are applied to a safety-critical component of a generally non-safety-critical system (like mobile 911) then we get bugs like this that canget people killed. How does our field improve on this? reply nneonneo 21 hours agoprevThis article is about an incident from just last month, but the fact that there are 20+ failure reports over just Feb 2022-Jan 2023 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;GooglePixel&#x2F;comments&#x2F;y039zn&#x2F;i_compi...), across multiple Pixel models, is insane. There’s something seriously wrong here. reply shawnz 19 hours agoparentIs there any data on how often this occurs with other brands, or what the failure rate was (i.e. how many attempts to call 911 succeeded in that time?) Otherwise 20+ reports certainly sounds bad but I don&#x27;t really have a perspective on how bad it is. It could very well be that 20 failures across a year is within the expected failure rate due to unavoidable transient network issues. reply Kwpolska 18 hours agorootparentThe author of the linked Reddit post was unable to find anything for other Android brands, and only three cases across ten years for iPhones. reply nneonneo 18 hours agorootparentAnd, it’s worth pointing out that the sales volumes of iPhones and just Samsungs (not counting any other brand) are many times that of Pixel, so if there was an issue even nearly as frequent with those phones it would definitely have been noticed by now. reply simfree 8 hours agorootparentSamsung has probably automated this testing given the number of SKUs they support, and they definitely have a lot more developers who are familiar with the cellular modems they use (Exynos and Snapdragon) to fix up edge cases unlike Google.The Pixel 6 (Pro and non-Pro) is a great example of an improperly tuned LTE&#x2F;5G NR modem. Cellular connectivity was unreliable as could be, and the random No Network issue seemed consistent across T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T, meanwhile a Pixel 7 or any other phone is stable and able to call&#x2F;use data when this is occuring.If this were a Samsung phone, it is likely their internal engineering could have identified the Exynos modem issue and pushed a patch, but no one at Google was familiar with the modem they bought from Samsung and they certainly have little leverage over &#x27;em to get issues like this resolved. reply nneonneo 8 hours agorootparentIt’s worth pointing out that the 911 issue cropped up on Pixel 7 phones too, so the issue is not unique to the Pixel 6 line. replylopkeny12ko 20 hours agoprevFunny, because I have the opposite problem. My Pixel dials 911 out of random and I always have to race to disconnect the call.Just last night my Pixel Watch started ringing out of random while I was eating dinner and it said it was dialing 911. I saw a phone call pop up on my Pixel 6 phone but fortunately canceled it before it connected. My watch didn&#x27;t even tell me why it dialed 911, and once I disconnected the call it just disappeared from my watch. Totally useless!There should really be a hard-to-accidentally-accept confirmation dialog for any kind of automated emergency dial feature. This is ridiculous because this is probably the 3rd time this has happened to me. reply rkagerer 19 hours agoparentJeez - can&#x27;t dial 911, randomly dials 911.I don&#x27;t understand why these devices can&#x27;t even do the most core feature of a phone properly.This will sound crass but the development teams (right up to CEO&#x27;s) should be dragged out to the gallows and flogged.If it was my product I would have made damn sure the 911 experience was perfect before shipping, and not rested for a minute until any bugs were solidly quashed - up to and including recalling all sold units and overhauling the flakey architecture if needed.This is life safety we&#x27;re talking about, not only for their users but also everyone else impacted by their blatent abuse of the emergency services system. Would we tolerate bridges that collapsed with equally ambivalent consequences for those who engineered them? reply guraf 16 hours agorootparentIn any other field, engineers would be held responsible and after so many \"mistakes\" they would lose their license.Software engineers will fight tooth and nails to keep their privilege is being called engineers whilst having none of the responsibility when it comes to the harm they&#x27;re causing. reply paulddraper 13 hours agorootparentReally? Who lost their engineering license from Firestone tires? Toyota gas pedals? Hasbro easy-bake oven? Graco high chairs?Stop trotting out the same baseless comment over and over. reply ThrowawayTestr 13 hours agorootparentIn my country, engineers are legally responsible for their work to the point where insurance is required to do engineering. And yes, engineers that are negligent are held responsible. Just because you&#x27;re ignorant doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t happen. reply paulddraper 13 hours agorootparentCertainly liability insurance exists.Let me know if find answers to my questions. reply ThrowawayTestr 13 hours agorootparentYou know any software engineers with liability insurance? Also, you would have learned of many examples had you gone to engineering school, we have whole courses dedicated to laws and ethics. reply paulddraper 11 hours agorootparentYes many software engineering firms hold liability insurance.And many software engineering contracts contain liability clauses. replystock_toaster 12 hours agorootparentprevIn most fields with “real engineers” do they also get told by management to ship things broken and&#x2F;or with arbitrary deadlines, or do they have the ability to push back on things, with some legal recourse or means to avoid the threat of losing their jobs if they say no to something, that software engineers lack?I don’t think things will change until corporate management changes (via being forced to, or otherwise). reply LinuxBender 19 hours agorootparentprevIf it was my product I would have made damn sure the 911 experience was perfect before shippingFor what it&#x27;s worth, every telco switch upgrade I performed ages ago, early days of GSM the first number I tested was 911. I made sure the dispatcher could hear me. I don&#x27;t know whats going on with the phone development side of things. That seems like a QA and customer feedback review problem. It probably also does not help that wireless vendors are slow&#x2F;hesitant to update phones. There is a fear of bricking phones and customer support nightmares their words, not mine. I could flash update a phone over the air but this was in the 90&#x27;s. No idea what that process looks like now. I assume they stage an update on a CDN after hopefully testing it extensively. Do all cell phones have two boot partitions in the event the upgrade process is sub-optimal(c)? reply numpad0 19 hours agorootparentprevI can hallucinate couple different explanations for that: - Modern software is way too overcomplicated to take seriously. - 911 is handled too specially, leading to oversights by implementers. - Feature importance to you has nothing to do with implementation difficulties.etc. reply rkagerer 18 hours agorootparentOne more I&#x27;d throw on the list is a growing trend in our field of shipping buggy products with the expectation we&#x27;ll fix them later via updates. It&#x27;s a terrible drug the internet enabled.The ironic thing is personally I only upgrade my phone every 5+ years and would be totally happy with longer development cycles. reply denysvitali 19 hours agorootparentprevYes, I think the real problem is #2.The only reliable way to test 911 features is a test lab, to which the average engineer doesn&#x27;t have access to. On top of that, calling 911 isn&#x27;t exactly as placing a normal call - so the only way to test is... to call 911.Again, a test lab should help towards these things, but I doubt Google has one accessible to the average engineer working on the dialer. Plus, they most likely don&#x27;t have a way to automatically test these changes - or they might happen as part of other \"features\" (remember the Microsoft Teams bug that caused similar issues?).In the end, the smarter our smartphones become - the dumber they are at doing the one single thing they were initially meant to do - get help in case of an emergency. reply philipov 18 hours agorootparent> Again, a test lab should help towards these things, but I doubt Google has one accessible to the average engineer working on the dialer.And why not? It seems like the real real problem is #4: Management doesn&#x27;t take seriously people&#x27;s need to reach emergency services because it&#x27;s not a profit center. reply denysvitali 18 hours agorootparentA test lab is a room that is completely isolated from the outside (and in a way that the RF doesn&#x27;t leak outside of the premises) where you can do these kind of experiments.Considering the amount of teams working on the Google Dialer, and the fact that they might be distributed across multiple cities &#x2F; countries - this sounds very expensive. reply evilduck 17 hours agorootparentBuilding a Faraday cage is an afternoon woodworking project. You can build them in your garage or bedroom with hand tools if you wanted. You don’t even need a huge room, a portable phone booth sized space could be mass produced and delivered on site. A Faraday Booth might take a few dozen square meters of copper mesh and some basic lumber, drywall and finishing efforts. If it took more than $10k per office I’d be shocked. This is something simple and cheap enough it could be something a local director or manager could charge to their company card and assembled themselves if they really cared. reply mlyle 16 hours agorootparentIt shouldn&#x27;t be too expensive, but before you put in equipment and pretend to be the phone network, you need to make sure that you&#x27;re hitting regulatory limits on the amount of RF leaking out. Doing a good enough job to hit that above a gigahertz--- including things like conducted RF, and validating with measurements-- is gonna cost a bit more than you describe. reply numpad0 16 hours agorootparent[1]. $1k, -95dB to 3GHz, in stock, manufacturer standard I&#x2F;O plates sold separately.

It just costs several tens of thousands, not $10k.It seems like at this point 911 usually works on Pixel, and there&#x27;s probably even good unit test and automated integration test of a lot of the components-- prearranged test calls with a given carrier&#x27;s 911 impl isn&#x27;t likely to fix it. But \"usually\" isn&#x27;t good enough: Google needs to actually figure out what&#x27;s going on, no matter what. reply Kwpolska 16 hours agorootparentprev$50k is chump change for Google. Regardless, there are costs and regulations associated with making a phone, and if you aren’t willing to adhere to that, you’d better keep making search engines and other websites. reply mlyle 16 hours agorootparent> $50k is chump change for Google.c.f. my comment:> > > It shouldn&#x27;t be too expensive, butPeople just don&#x27;t read and understand that you can agree with the broader scope of comment but not the details. reply numpad0 16 hours agorootparentprevOur primary concern is dialer crashing!

That&#x27;s just stupid.I feel like you didn&#x27;t read my comment. I stated that a screened room isn&#x27;t prohibitively expensive, but can&#x27;t be delivered for the suggested $10k. In another comment, I said \"Society spends a few billion dollars a year on E911 and related infrastructure. To have faith in it eroded because of a little bit of slipshod validation by phone vendors is a false economy.\"Why isn&#x27;t it possible to have nuanced discussions-- to condemn Google&#x27;s failure here, but also to suggest that the capital expense to give people realistic test environments is probably higher than others are suggesting?Frankly, you&#x27;re being abrasive. reply numpad0 14 hours agorootparentYou must have the UI? Call your factory, ask them make an extra ICE and hook it up to the simulator through an attenuator and shielded cables. Easy. Cost couple cars worth, so what. Add noises, simulate phasing, handover, do anything you want to. premises is, you&#x27;re a top mass market smart phone manufacturer, and Google, both of that at the same time.No, you&#x27;re trying to find a way to make it sound impossible. But what you&#x27;re saying is more along, probably, \"finding a parking lot to test brakes is impossible even for a car company\". Something real stupid as that. reply mlyle 13 hours agorootparentNo. I&#x27;m just saying that it costs like $40-100k in practice to get a screened room into operation, not $10k, but that this is still a reasonable expense.But you&#x27;re too boiling over in vitriol to understand nuance. Somehow, in your mind, saying that you can&#x27;t do it for $10k appears to be me defending Google. reply throwaway12046 13 hours agorootparentEven if it costs $1M, Google either has to do it or stop selling phones and recall sold units. reply philipov 10 hours agorootparentprevI think maybe GP is getting you confused with the person who brought up the suggestion it&#x27;s expensive in the first place, before we started looking into what the numbers really would be. While the initial statement of that sounds like defending Google, that wasn&#x27;t you, and unpacking the costs is intellectually interesting on its own merits, say, for anyone who might want to do it themselves. replyevilduck 16 hours agorootparentprevFine, for permitting and regulations and inspections, let’s 100x the cost and say it’s an annual expense too. This is still well within Google’s budgets to provide to their Android teams. reply taway1237 9 minutes agorootparentThis discussion is moot btw. Google already has faraday cage and bts equipment, at least in the London office (6ps) where a large part of the Android team is located. And obviously so - the costs involved are a rounding error for Google. The problem must be somewhere else. philipov 18 hours agorootparentprevIf Google, of all companies, can&#x27;t afford the necessary testing equipment for a critical function, who can? If they thought that emergency services would make them money, they could have a lab in every office.

Not too sure. reply 4RealFreedom 17 hours agorootparentprevArguing an expensive price tag for Google just doesn&#x27;t resonate. They are building a phone - it should be able to do the one thing that it should, as others have said.

I&#x27;m sure they care, in some abstract sense, about PR (well, not Musk). I just think they&#x27;re out of touch and incompetent at dealing with it.

Clearly the costs of bad PR aren&#x27;t high enough. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 17 hours agorootparentThey care if bad PR results in less money. Wizards +Unity realized they pushed too hard and will ultimately cost them. Reddit thinks their decision still makes financial sense. reply philipov 17 hours agorootparentAnd Google is making exactly the same calculation.

They&#x27;re also not expensive at Google scale. It does concern me that there were anecdotal posts that read to me like that, developing firmwares and not blatantly violating basic assumptions and principles and core premises of Google MDM cannot occur simultaneously.

Still, rather \"expensive\" to setup in multiple locations for just a team that develops a dialer.Additionally, you&#x27;d have to test this across multiple OS versions, and devices.

Of course Google should have no problem affording any of that, but these details do matter.I suspect that the problem must be more complex than a bug in just the phone or the OS; for one thing, the problem is intermittent and doesn’t affect every phone.

I assume that&#x27;s a legal requirement; on its face it&#x27;s pretty reasonable.I never used to lock my phone at all, but starting with the Pixel 3a I&#x27;ve been forced to do it by the fact that the phone interprets rubbing against my leg through my pocket as a stream of commands. I wish manufacturers would go back to the non-crazy screens they used to make.

This might not be a bug in Google&#x27;s dialer (or the OS, or hardware). Based on my past experience building B2B SIP clients, I remember that there are ways to intercept many of the Android system broadcasts. I&#x27;d bet on that being the root cause. Intercepting would look like the app is crashing, when instead it would be attempting to re-route requests to a different app; someone else mentioned they detected Microsoft Teams doing that. I remember Skype also had this feature, so it sounds plausible.In the B2B world, we often had weird requests e.g. to take over the whole phone experience and do something different – this was made possible by the same core Android SDKs that they ship both to business devices and personal devices.For example, we were required to move each 911 call to our app first, then check if we can route it quicker through the internal PBXs, and if not – send it back to the native&#x2F;built-in dialer. This was possible a couple of years ago, we built it. I assume it&#x27;s still possible because it&#x27;s really rare that you need this kind of functionality... releasing such an app also requires a special review from Google.

Not sure I agree in a isolated incident.But I feel like it should be a crime to ignore a known issue like this. reply surfingdino 21 hours agoprevThis is unacceptable. They should loose certification for the device. reply lionkor 21 hours agoprevWhen my OnePlus 8T lags, I sometimes press the power button a few times, because I&#x27;m impatient and I&#x27;m trying to get the screen to turn on.Pressing the power button 5 times dials the emergency service number by default, so I&#x27;ve almost called emergency services a few times already. I usually manage to cancel it before it dials, but wow. reply klausjensen 20 hours agoparentJust tested on pixel 7a.When I click the power button 5x, a screen appears with:- A large circle in the middle of the screen, which I have to press and hold for 3 seconds to initiate the call.- A slider to cancel the screen entirelySo just hitting the powerbutton 5x does not actually make the call on Pixel 7a, just makes it easier. reply mook 16 hours agoparentprevFWIW, you can disable that in settings (both the power button thing, as well as the auto-dial if you prefer to get to that page via buttons). At least, if the 8T is similar to other phones. reply bell-cot 14 hours agoprevIt seems pretty odd that liability-lawsuit lawyers haven&#x27;t managed to monetize this \"feature\" enough to push \"removing\" it further up the priority list. Anybody have some insight? reply linux2647 19 hours agoprevA bit OT: but TIL you can schedule a test 911 call. reply user_7832 21 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s really absurd how such a problem still exists. Couldn&#x27;t a separate method be used for emergency calling? For example drop to 3g, don&#x27;t use the dialer app but a separate \"emergency\" app. reply chrismorgan 21 hours agoparentIf talking about the US (though it’s not the only place that uses the number 911, and I would imagine that other countries’ numbers would be affected): all the major 3G networks have been shut down, so your current options for major networks are T-Mobile’s 2G network (which I successfully dialed 911 with a couple of months ago while in the US, but it’s only spottily available, and it’s being shut down next year), or 4G networks.More generally, though, using different code paths for emergency dialing is the root of the problem in the first place—you want to minimise special handling of things like this, because less-tested paths are much more likely to be buggy. Consider also: error handling code is pretty much the buggiest out there, because it’s seldom tested. reply usr1106 21 hours agorootparentAt least 2 decades ago when I worked with phones the phone as a list of emergency numbers which could be updated to country-spefic values. Often 000, 112, and 911 were always present.Once the software notices one of these numbers dialled call handling will go a completely different code path than normal calls.I have no idea how things work in Android, where you obviously must have VoIP hooks? reply joecool1029 18 hours agorootparent>I have no idea how things work in Android, where you obviously must have VoIP hooks?Yes, there&#x27;s emergency IMS (basically volte&#x2F;vonr version of SIP) profiles the phone is supposed to register to and all the carriers towers advertise emergency numbers in their signaling. reply alerighi 20 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with 4G (and 5G) is that it supports only internet traffic. Phone traffic is passed trough VoLTE that is VOIP on the network. Is something that is fairly new, few years ago only a couple of operators in my country even supported that, and thus phones had to drop to 3G to handle calls. Also VOIP is not that reliable and presents problems especially with different networks.The problem is when the internet connection is not so stable, and thus VoLTE doesn&#x27;t work that well. The safer option would be to drop to 3G or even 2G if available to complete emergency calls. reply kiwijamo 12 hours agorootparentI think you missed the point in the post that you are replying to saying carriers have dropped 3G and the only remaining 2G network is also on its way out. Where I live all carriers are planning to phase out 3G by the end of 2025. All but one carrier have already phased out 2G.We need to forget about falling back to 3G or 2G as that is not a viable solution in the long run. The carriers and phone manufactures have a responsibility to make emergencies calls work well over VoLTE. reply covercash 20 hours agoparentprevIt would be great if when 911 is dialed the phone dropped into a “black box” state where all unnecessary functionality is suspended to maximize battery and signal. It could alert emergency contacts w&#x2F; location pings, start recording voice and video, and go into a heightened security mode to avoid tampering. reply readams 16 hours agorootparentNo you definitely don&#x27;t want the phone doing confusing and weird things during an emergency. You want it to behave in the way the user is accustomed. reply usr1106 21 hours agoparentprevI thought 3G networks have been shut down in the US? (Not living there but I remotely maintain some devices with cellular modems over there, so the topic has somewhat of professional interest.) reply spacebouy 20 hours agorootparentThey have not. 2G networks have been shut down, however. reply joecool1029 18 hours agorootparentIncorrect, T-Mobile&#x27;s 2G network is active until this coming April. Both their 3G networks (theirs and the Sprint legacy one) are shut down as they used more spectrum. Keeping GSM going the spectrum use is minimal. reply phh 21 hours agoparentprevHaving dedicated code path for 911 is literally the problem. It makes it legally almost impossible to test in many countries (since in many countries you&#x27;re not allowed to dial 911 if you don&#x27;t have an emergency) reply toast0 19 hours agorootparentWhich countries? Where I live, in the US, if you want to make a callback to a police detective, you have to call 911 and ask to be transfered. It&#x27;s clearly not an emergency, and the detective will tell you to do it. This police department doesn&#x27;t have a phone system that allows the public to call a non-emergency number and have their calls routed.But most places I&#x27;ve lived in the US had a non-emergency police number, and non-emergency 911 calls were very discouraged. If you have a good reason to make them for network or device testing, you&#x27;d just need to schedule a time to make a test call, stay on the line and tell the operator, etc.Device development would be well served by using a tower simulator in a Faraday cage, as a sibling suggested.

It has saved countless lives. In the days of not having a landline this is completely unacceptable.To have issues utilizing 911 from a cellular device in 2023 is exactly the kind of thing regulators should make painful for device manufacturers who can’t even get this right.What’s even more puzzling is the brand and reputational damage when stories emerge in the press of people dying because their $500 (or more) device couldn’t do something a free phone without a SIM card can do.You’d think they’d take this seriously if for no other reason other than self interest. reply charcircuit 14 hours agorootparent>has been arguably the most impactful killer app since cell phones first emerged over 40 years ago.I strongly disagree.

Shared by Steven Lee Contact: Steven Lee, (210) 450-3823, lees22@uthscsa.edu SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 20, 2023 – A new published study led by researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) has found an association between autism diagnosis in boys and daily consumption of either diet soda or a comparable amount of aspartame by their mothers during pregnancy or breastfeeding. In this case-control study, boys who had been diagnosed with autism were more than three times as likely as neurotypically developing boys to have been born to mothers who reported consuming one or more servings per day of diet soda, or comparable amounts of the leading artificial sweetener aspartame, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. No statistically significant association was found in female offspring. “These associations do not prove causality, but taken in concert with reports from earlier studies of increased prematurity and cardiometabolic health impacts among infants and children exposed daily to diet beverages and/or aspartame during pregnancy, our findings raise new questions about potential neurological impacts that need to be addressed,” said Raymond F. Palmer, PhD, senior author of the paper, and professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at UT Health San Antonio. The study, “Daily Early-Life Exposures to Diet Soda and Aspartame Are Associated with Autism in Males: A Case-Control Study,” was published in Nutrients, an international journal of human nutrition, on Aug. 29. Palmer and lead author Sharon Parten Fowler, PhD, MPH, adjunct assistant professor of medicine at UT Health San Antonio, were joined by researchers from School of Public Health campuses in San Antonio and Houston of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and the School of Public Health at San Diego State University. Sharon Parten Fowler, PhD, MPH Since its introduction, aspartame consumption has been reported to cause neurological problems in some users. It has also been associated with increased health problems among the offspring of animals fed aspartame during pregnancy, and among children whose mothers had consumed diet sodas, other diet beverages and/or aspartame daily during pregnancy. For the new study, researchers hypothesized that exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding to at least one can of diet soda per day, or an amount of aspartame equivalent to the dosage in one can of diet cola per day, increases autism risk. The case-control study collected retrospective dietary “recalls,” or written estimates, of diet beverage and aspartame consumption during pregnancy or breastfeeding from mothers of 235 offspring with autism spectrum disorder, and 121 offspring with typical neurological development (the control group). From these recalls, exposure odds ratios were computed for all offspring diagnosed with autism, and for the subset of offspring with non-regressive – or early-onset – autism. The researchers found that males diagnosed with autism disorder had more than tripled odds of having been exposed daily to these products during pregnancy or breastfeeding, compared with male controls. These exposure odds were greatest among males with non-regressive autism. “Our findings contribute to the growing literature raising concerns about potential offspring harm from maternal diet beverage and aspartame consumption during pregnancy,” said Fowler, who for the past decade has researched the health impacts of chronic exposure to non-nutritive sweeteners, including the risk of autism, and of cardiometabolic disease in children, adolescents and adults. She is an affiliate member of the International Society for Autism Research. The researchers conclude that further research – including larger sample sizes of both sexes, and prospective measurement of dietary exposures and additional risk factors – is needed to evaluate these associations in other study populations, and to assess whether they extend to risk of autism spectrum disorder in all offspring. In the meantime, however, the possibility that early-life exposures to these products through maternal diet might increase offspring neurodevelopmental risk, at least among boys, is of particular concern. “The findings suggest that women should exercise caution when considering the use of these products during pregnancy and breastfeeding until further assessments are available,” Fowler said. “Maternal consumption of these products during periods of heightened offspring vulnerability represents a modifiable potential risk factor, the elimination of which might help to protect susceptible offspring in the next generation.” Daily Early-Life Exposures to Diet Soda and Aspartame Are Associated with Autism in Males: A Case-Control Study Sharon Parten Fowler, David Gimeno Ruiz de Porras, Michael D.

The most ridiculous confidence interval I&#x27;ve ever seen! 1.02 to 9.7, reported as \"tripled\", seriously? And of course the data is non-blinded, self-reported survey responses recalling events that occurred many years ago, and the analysis is not preregistered and splits the cohort in an arbitrary way to eke out so-called \"statistical significance\" (by the slimmest imaginable margin, 1.02 > 1.00, just barely).How can this dreck be published? Everyone involved should be sanctioned. And everyone who took this headline at face value should seriously reconsider their approach to consuming science news. reply danShumway 16 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s honestly embarrassing to see this article somehow climb to the top of HN. It&#x27;s a mess of statistical bad practice, self-reported data, and potentially confounded or ignored variables.Normally when I see a bad study there&#x27;s like one or two serious problems with methodology, but when I read this through it&#x27;s almost just every couple of paragraphs that the authors will say something or describe methodology that should be giving the reader pause. From literally the first paragraph in the intro:> Changes in diagnostic definitions and guidelines and increased testing availability and funding have made major contributions to this increase in diagnosed cases; under the added impacts of changes in dietary, environmental, and other exposures affecting the intrauterine environment, ASD prevalence has reached unprecedented proportions.Those two sentences contradict each other! You can&#x27;t just tie them together with a semicolon like one thought implies the other. I&#x27;m not even saying that autism cases aren&#x27;t actually rising at all, but you can&#x27;t just go \"our diagnostic criteria have changed; therefore environmental and dietary exposures are the cause.\" You have to actually put in the bare-bottom minimal amount of work to describe why you think that diagnostic criteria and social awareness aren&#x27;t the primary causes, you can&#x27;t just claim that changing diagnostic criteria itself implies diets are to blame.It&#x27;s unsurprising that somebody who would write this way would do bad statistical analysis. reply bornfreddy 16 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s honestly embarrassing to see this article somehow climb to the top of HN.To be fair, upvote doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean \"I agree with this\", it often just means \"this is the topic I would like to discuss\".I agree that the article is crap though. reply bogeholm 16 hours agorootparentprev>> Changes in …> Those two sentences contradict each other!Id say that it’s a non sequitur; the first part of the sentence before the semicolon states something completely different than what follows, so the ‘impacts’ can’t be ‘added’ - they don’t have the same units. reply danShumway 16 hours agorootparentFair point; it&#x27;s not that changing diagnostics mean that there can&#x27;t be environmental&#x2F;dietary changes contributing to increased autism cases, it&#x27;s that the article just entirely skips over that part.

I fell for it. And I upvoted it.I understood enough that this study found a correlation and that this was based on surveys. I thought it was an interesting finding, and concluded that this correlation should be examined more closely with more rigorous studies.I did not go into the details of methodology and statistics and did not conclude, like you did, that this study has dubious value.This is a trap that the public find themselves in with science reporting. Many people on HN have technical training to grasp these concepts but not understand them. I my self program, and use many of the same intellectual building blocks scientists use in the execution of my job. But I am not a scientist.I am not a scientist is the key point because it means that I do not understand science. I know the “process” of science. I’ve read scientific papers. I’ve done toy experiments in school and in university. But I don’t understand it. To draw an analogy, Programming is a perception of reality. There are things that I do that I can never explain to management because they do not have direct experience with it. The “identity a bird in the park” XKCD comic is a meme of this concept [1] notwithstanding advances in AI research.Like programming, science is a perception of reality. Like my management, I may have taken statistics, I know what confidence intervals are. But I have not lived the experience of building an experiment. Getting results, analyzing them, and constructing the distinctions necessary to reach an interesting and valid conclusion. If you’ve gone though that process, you know where to look for problems in a study. I and many people don’t. We will at best say, further study is needed, and at worst say that diet soda causes autism.The public depends on experts to enter the conversation and share why things are wrong. This of course gets into the problem of “lies will make it half way around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes”. Retractions may be made, but never perceived. This makes us vulnerable to bad faith actors employing the gish gallop and there’s not a general purpose solution to that.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1425&#x2F; reply lost_tourist 5 hours agoparentprevYeah I had a nursing friend bring this up to me and I looked up the paper; i don&#x27;t know jack about the medical industry but these numbers were ridiculous and the methods atrocious lol.

Their discussion of &#x27;why&#x27; was not very compelling. I have a hard time thinking there&#x27;s anything causative with such a disparity in sex.I also noticed that adjusting for some of the larger confounders for autism (maternal age, SES) didn&#x27;t move the needle much. I would expect there to be a much larger difference between adjusted&#x2F;not-adjusted OR. Maybe there&#x27;s other confounders lurking or the adjustment was insufficient. reply foobiekr 18 hours agoparentAnything involving estrogens (such as plastics) will have sex-linked impacts. reply asmor 17 hours agorootparentCommon misconception: Most estrogens (particularly phytoestrogens, but also plastics) bind to receptors so weakly, they work more like antagonists in the presence of stronger estrogens (like red meat).It&#x27;d be like trying to do anabolic steroids while your natural testosterone is very high. reply awestroke 17 hours agorootparentThe endocrine system is complex and involves multiple pathways and feedback loops. A single compound&#x27;s weak or strong binding affinity to a receptor doesn&#x27;t provide a complete picture of its physiological impact. reply asmor 17 hours agorootparentThis was not meant to be an exhaustive explainer, rather a single caveat to stop the \"all you need is high absolute T and low absolute E\" simplification in its tracks.Receptor saturation (in this case, E1 vs E2; first pass metabolism turns E2 into E1) is something I had to learn out of neccessity because my endocrinologist didn&#x27;t really do anything beyond loosely following ancient standards of practice (we don&#x27;t have specialized gender clinics in Germany). reply yieldcrv 17 hours agoparentprevgirls are already underdiagnosed for autism, and cultural norms allow their neurodivergence to blend in, so the data will always be bad if the parent doesn&#x27;t have a daughter diagnosed with autism reply BadCookie 17 hours agoprevI hazard a guess that the most popular diet soda is Diet Coke, which contains significantly more caffeine than regular Coke. Even if there is a causal link between autism in the son and diet soda consumption in the mother, jumping to the conclusion that it is the fault of aspartame specifically seems dubious.Additionally, do we know whether autistic people drink more diet soda than others? If autism is at least partly genetic, as it seems to be, then the mothers in the study might themselves be autistic or carriers of autism-linked genetic mutations.I have read in prior research that overweight mothers are more likely to have autistic children. Another possibility is that being overweight is associated with frequent diet soda consumption, and it’s the mother being overweight that is more the issue than the soda consumption per se.Anyway, I am not at all convinced of the implication that a mother drinking diet soda increases her child’s risk of autism, especially if the mother is at a healthy weight. reply crazygringo 17 hours agoparent> Diet Coke, which contains significantly more caffeine than regular CokeI&#x27;d never heard that before, but you&#x27;re right -- \"Coke contains 32 mg of caffeine per 12-ounce (335-ml) serving. Diet Coke is higher in caffeine, with about 42 mg per 12 ounces (335 ml).\" [1]I wonder why that is? If people expect an energy boost from Coke, and if sugar isn&#x27;t contributing to that any more, a little extra caffeine will?Coke Zero, on the other hand, \"contains only 34mg of caffeine per can (12oz)\" [2]. So it&#x27;s more like regular Coke.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;nutrition&#x2F;caffeine-in-coke[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifeboostcoffee.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;lifeboost&#x2F;caffeine-in-coke... reply freedomben 17 hours agorootparentCaffeine is an important part of the taste, so I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s largely a taste-based decision.

Is there a hypothesis for why it only affects them?I wonder, are we simply underdianosing the women with autism as usual?And I wonder if there&#x27;s a correlation between drinking diet sodas (as opposed to naturally sweetened?) and getting your children evaluated for autism (like, say - diet soda drinkers are on average wealthier, and that correlates with better access to healthcare and more parental involvement, thus reducing underdiagnosis of autism?)Given how sensitive obstetrics are to even small risks and how prevalent aspartame is, I&#x27;d be surprised if there is a genuine causal link here of such strong statistical effect. I mean, how many people use zofran? And yet obstetrics we&#x27;re limiting its use in pregnant women just for a very very small alleged increase in the risk of heart problems in the baby. reply Retric 18 hours agoparent4 out of 5 people diagnosed with autism are male. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sex_and_gender_differences_in_...So, there’s a significant gender difference here, possibly with diagnosis but likely a deeper connection. Alternatively, it might impact both but this study didn’t have enough statistical power to notice the correlation. reply hinkley 18 hours agorootparentGP is alluding to the fact that social pressure on girls to be “nice” is so intense that many develop coping and masking mechanisms at a young age, confounding the diagnostic process. Boys have a more bohemian lifestyle and are easier to catch.Same happens with ADD. A lot of parents are diagnosed in hindsight when their child is diagnosed. “Wait my son had ADHD because he acts like this? I acted exactly like this.” reply afavour 17 hours agorootparentIf I recall there is a marked difference in ADHD between genders. In boys it manifests the way we typically imagine ADHD: the physical hyperactivity, etc., while girls are much more likely to have “inattentive” ADHD which is much more easily missed. They simply can’t hold attention on things for long and frequently have emotional outbursts but they’re aren’t as physically obvious. reply hinkley 17 hours agorootparentI know a 20 year old boy who was diagnosed not long ago with inattentive type. I wonder how different his academic career and life would be if it was caught earlier.But I also have known women who will happily bounce from topic to topic and the hint of a tangent, and it’s obvious to me they should have been diagnosed by ten. Some have been as young adults, some older, one at least I don’t think ever was. It’s not just different presentations. We don’t want to see it. reply lolinder 17 hours agorootparentprevBoth presentations can manifest in either gender, but girls are more likely to have the inattentive presentation than the hyperactive one.Inattentive is a bit of a misnomer, too—it&#x27;s not that they can&#x27;t hold attention on something, it&#x27;s that they have a hard time controlling where their attention goes. This is another reason why this presentation often flies under the radar: \"my {daughter&#x2F;son} can&#x27;t have ADHD, {she&#x2F;he} can stay focused on {favorite activity here} for hours!\" reply hinkley 14 hours agorootparentThat dysregulation of focus leads to shame spiraling. Both from parents and self inflicted. reply 63 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is anecdotal but I strongly disagree with \"likely a deeper connection.\" I really do think girls are just severely under diagnosed. I have several adult women and AFAB friends who all display autistic traits and, to me (an autistic man), are very obviously autistic but it&#x27;s been so hard for them to get a diagnosis even when they want to. The system is really set up to diagnose young boys with rich families only. Getting diagnosed as an adult is expensive and arduous and most people in the field appear to be biased against diagnosing women. Granted, autistic traits are presented slightly differently in women due to cultural norms but I do believe they&#x27;re easy to spot with practice. reply WendyTheWillow 17 hours agorootparentWouldn’t being autistic yourself make it harder, not easier, for you to notice autism in others? reply 63 8 hours agorootparentCan you explain your reasoning for this? I&#x27;ve found that neurotypical people are pretty bad at identifying autistic people who are masking (that is after all the point of masking) whereas it&#x27;s relatively easy for me to recognize it because I&#x27;m so familiar with my own mask. I&#x27;d also like to believe that I have more knowledge about autism in general than your average allistic person. They might be able to recognize that something is \"off\" about a person but I don&#x27;t think they could reliably point out when it is or isn&#x27;t autism and I think they&#x27;d have a pretty hard time justifying it if they do guess correctly. Maybe the close family members of autistic people could do well at it though. reply Retric 7 hours agorootparentAutism is a pervasive developmental disorder often associated with an inability to speak, serious intellectual disability, and similar issues. The less extreme cases have dramatically more contact with the wider population introducing an odd form of social survival bias.At the same time the term has been more widely applied over time to include people with minimal intellectual or linguistic impairment, but that doesn’t mean people with such profound issues no longer exist.Thus, if you’re talking about the full autistic population overall they are going to on average be worse at basically any task. reply WendyTheWillow 6 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding of autism was that those who have it are often less able to accurately evaluate others’ emotional states, which I extrapolated to identifying autistic behaviors. I don’t doubt you have a ton of knowledge on the topic, I asked in order to better understand from you if this idea is accurate, but didn’t want to put in a whole explanation if you weren’t interested in engaging. replyartursapek 17 hours agoparentprevThe symptoms of autism are more obvious in males, socially reply mcpackieh 18 hours agoparentprevThe paper doesn&#x27;t say it only happens in males. The paper says they found it to happen in males, but they don&#x27;t have a statistically relevant result for females and need more data.Abstract:> No statistically significant associations were found in females.Discussion section:> Several possible explanations exist for the lack of associations among girls in our study; these include insufficient statistical power, inherent sex dimorphism in response to DS&#x2F;aspartame exposures, and possibly even the recruitment strategy itself, which, by including as controls neurotypically developing female siblings of male cases, increased the likelihood that any early-life exposures found to be risk-enhancing among their brothers with ASD might appear to be negatively associated with ASD in the analyses for females. Further research with larger sample sizes for both sexes and prospectively gathered data would be important for investigating this association further in females and in all participants combined.This study didn&#x27;t find an effect in females, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t one. reply cma 17 hours agoparentprevOnly like ~15 diet drink drinking mothers of females with autism were included in the study. They said they didn&#x27;t show a link, not that they demonstrated a lack of a link. And I believe none of the links shown for males were claimed to be causal but were hypothesized to be.To control for demographics they divided that ~15 into 6 different demographics (or 5 if male&#x2F;female was already included, about 3 people per demographic if so). reply virtuous_sloth 18 hours agoprevThe 95% confidence intervals all start at 1.1 or lower.

On top of that there&#x27;s basically no way to get this sort of population without putting out fliers to the effect of \"we&#x27;re looking for people with autistic children for a study on causes of autism\" which is gonna select for people that think autism is problem and are looking for something to blame. reply klysm 13 hours agorootparentI’m not sure I see how that would result in these statistics though.

We&#x27;re still paying the cost of introducing lead into our environment in a myriad of subtle ways. We still don&#x27;t fully understand what the cost of the introduction of microplastics or PFAS is going to be. And regardless of the whether this particular study holds up under replication it is looking increasingly likely that aspartame is not something we should be consuming.And what&#x27;s most frustrating is that the people who profited most from these compounds never pay for the damage they cause to generations. reply htag 17 hours agoparent> We really need to change the regulations around the introduction of new chemical compounds to our environment on a mass scale.What specific studies should we have done to notice this association? What specific safety studies need to be done before introducing a new chemical compound into our society?Historically speaking, the only conceivable way they would have learned this if they feed aspartame to pregnant women and then studied the offsprings. This is fine for a final testing phase of safety, but is inhumane to do unless you are incredibly sure it is safe. Animal models for studying autism are flawed, and wouldn&#x27;t come at all for decades after aspartame&#x27;s introduction.In modern testing, we could theoretically generate a super long list of safety checks to do. This test might look like raising a large generation or two of the specific line of mice used for studying autism. Then checking the offspring autism rate of those exposed to aspartame compared to a control. This would be a single checkbox every new chemical compound would need to do, and there could easily be tens of thousands of similar tests that would need to be done. We would need to add to the list overtime, as our understanding of optimal human health improves over time.Imagine the investment required to pass these safety tests. It&#x27;s a minimum price tag of 25M, if the safety tests are standardized and lab techs are trained on them and do them in an assembly line like fashion. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the cost be 10-100x. At that level of investment there&#x27;s two issues. The number of new chemical compounds added into our lives will move to a very slow rate. The other problem is this is just the safety test portion of R&D, after spending so much money this seems like a likely target for corruption and my skepticism for the results of such a test will be high. reply patapong 17 hours agorootparent> The number of new chemical compounds added into our lives will move to a very slow rate.Could you elaborate on why this is a problem? It seems to me that there is not inherent right to introduce new chemicals into our lives, and I would prefer this not be done without thorough risk assessment studies.In the medical industry, introducing a new medicine requires years of testing for something that will be given to a tiny slice of the population. I find it odd that there does not seem to be a similar process for chemicals that could be spread throughout the entire population. reply htag 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not capable of doing a full analysis on this question. I don&#x27;t mean to say that this ban isn&#x27;t worth doing, I meant to acknowledge that this has a downside. Let me throw out a few bullet points of those downsides of reducing the rate of new chemical compounds introduced to society.* We are often creating chemicals that do the job of existing chemicals safer and more efficient. This ban would probably include a grandfather clause for old chemicals, and thus we might be using inferior products and doing more harm than we otherwise could. Look at refrigerants as an example of a chemical compound that has improved over the decades.* Many chemical compounds introduced in the last 100 years directly improve productivity. The United States is in economic competition with other regions of the world. We could be creating a disadvantage that reduces our geo-political power.* Many of these chemical compound increase quality of life. There&#x27;s a strong unitarian argument for sucralose and polyurethane insulation. reply patapong 11 hours agorootparentThank you, these are fair points! reply lo_zamoyski 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy use it in the first place? There is no need in general to consume aspartame.

It’s not like if you release a chemical into the wild, that no pregnant woman will consume it. They will.

It breaks down into three well known compounds that are found in much greater amounts in our natural diets, phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol.The amounts of these digestion products are much lower than those obtained from many other natural dietary sources.3,25 For example, the amount of methanol in tomato juice is 6 times greater than that derived from aspartame in diet cola.25 The amino acids aspartate (ie, anion of aspartic acid) and phenylalanine are very common in the diet, found in foods such as lean protein, beans, and dairy, with 100 g of chicken providing an almost 40 times greater intake of aspartate and a 12.5 greater intake of phenylalanine than a diet soda.25 In the body, the 3 digestion products follow their normal metabolic pathways, being broken down further, taken up by tissues in the body, or excreted. Thus, due to the rapid digestion of aspartame in the gastrointestinal lumen and small intestinal mucosal cells before reaching the bloodstream, the intact aspartame molecule is never present in internal tissues in the body or breast milk.3,25,28 The absence of aspartame in the breast milk of lactating women consuming aspartame was recently confirmed.21https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;nutritionreviews&#x2F;article&#x2F;74&#x2F;11&#x2F;670&#x2F;... reply lo_zamoyski 17 hours agoparentprevEurope has, I will not say a perfect, but a saner approach to these sorts of things, in general.

The common good is sacrificed for the sake of the inferior end of making a buck.Artificial sweeteners, specifically, are a bandage over the festering wound of a culture of mindless consumption. Companies want you to consume more so you buy more, but as soon as people began to worry about the rather expected obesity resulting from gorging and constant snacking on food and drink, and mediocre food and drink at that, the only alternative in the unhinged profit-above-all-else logic of consumerism is to maintain or increase consumption exceeding actual need, but reduce the apparent consequences of mindless consumption.The common good requires a conservative legal oversight in this space where weird food additives are concerned, but it also includes abstract truths like \"gluttony is evil\" or \"making financial profit the highest end is disordered\". Our cultural and civilizational demise is rooted in things like the latter, and the intellectual and spiritual rot and resulting debasement of common sensibilities regarding such intangibles.

Dioscorides cautions against taking white lead internally, as it is deadly (V.103). Soranus recommends that the mouth of the uterus be smeared with white lead to prevent conception (Gynecology, I.19.61). Galen (On Antidotes, XIV.144) and Celsus (V.27.12b) both provide an antidote for poisoning by white lead, and Vitruvius remarks on the pernicious effects of water found near lead mines and its effect on the body (VIII.3.5, 6.11).The earliest description of acute lead poisoning (mid-second century BC) is given in the Alexipharmaca of Nicander, who speaks of \"gleaming, deadly white lead whose fresh colour is like milk which foams all over\" (II.74ff). The poet describes a frothing mouth, asperity of the tongue, and dry throat, together with dry retching, chills, delusions, and overwhelming fatigue. But if lead poisoning had been endemic, it presumably would have been remarked upon at the time. And yet there is no mention of the fact until early in the seventh century AD, when Paul of Aegina, a Byzantine physician, described chronic lead poisoning (although he does not associate its symptoms with the disease). \"I am of the opinion that the colic affection which now prevails is occasioned by such humours; the disease having taken its rise in the country of Italy, but raging also in many other regions of the Roman empire, like a pestilential contagion, which in many cases terminates in epilepsy, but in others in paralysis of the extremities, while the sensibility of them is preserved, and sometimes both these afflictions attacking together\" (Medical Compendium in Seven Books, III.64). reply mcpackieh 17 hours agorootparentprevNot IQ specifically but there were Romans who recognized that lead, and specifically lead pipes, were harmful:Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (c. 80 BCE – c. 15 BCE) wrote:> 10. Clay pipes for conducting water have the following advantages. In the first place, in construction:--if anything happens to them, anybody can repair the damage. Secondly, water from clay pipes is much more wholesome than that which is conducted through lead pipes, because lead is found to be harmful for the reason that white lead is derived from it, and this is said to be hurtful to the human system. Hence, if what is produced from it is harmful, no doubt the thing itself is not wholesome.> 11. This we can exemplify from plumbers, since in them the natural colour of the body is replaced by a deep pallor. For when lead is smelted in casting, the fumes from it settle upon their members, and day after day burn out and take away all the virtues of the blood from their limbs. Hence, water ought by no means to be conducted in lead pipes, if we want to have it wholesome. That the taste is better when it comes from clay pipes may be proved by everyday life, for though our tables are loaded with silver vessels, yet everybody uses earthenware for the sake of purity of taste.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ten_Books_on_Architecture&#x2F;Boo... reply blowski 17 hours agorootparentprevThe Romans understood the issue of lead poisoning? reply airstrike 17 hours agorootparentapparently they did reply null0ranje 17 hours agoparentprevThis concept exists.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Precautionary_principle reply paulddraper 17 hours agoparentprevHow?You&#x27;re going to study autism in lab rats?

The study isn&#x27;t saying that aspartame is the only cause of autism; your anecdata would refute that claim but that&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re saying.The study does suggest that the effect is caused by one of the metabolites of aspartame, methanol. Methanol doesn&#x27;t only come from aspartame in diet soda (and for that matter, aspartame isn&#x27;t only found in diet soda, any chance your parents used aspartame to sweeten their coffee or tea?)

(It&#x27;s also found in liquor, particularly moonshine, but the paper doesn&#x27;t mention this.) reply talos 18 hours agoprevCouldn&#x27;t this be trivially confounded by differing patterns of diet soda consumption between groups with differing likelihoods of autism-diagnosed children? reply Avshalom 17 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s that. There&#x27;s a cultural fear of aspartame that could cause people who don&#x27;t like their child&#x27;s diagnose to over report aspartame consumption* because they want something to blame. There&#x27;s self selection in the study group (235 kids with autism vs 120 without is not a random population sample). I made the quip in another comment this is self reported consumption from memory.*That 200+ vs 100+ ratio in the groups kinda implies they went looking for this specific connection rather than it just popping up as they did various regressions, and if you&#x27;re looking for a specific connection it&#x27;s easy to accidently-on-purpose pull in people who already believe in that connection which can color their recollection. reply dynm 16 hours agoprevCome on people. This is pure correlational data. All they did was ask some people to fill out surveys. Worrying about the size of the confidence intervals is completely beside the point. Correlational data like this says nothing about causality.Just look at the sneaky \"linked\" word in the title. Technically they aren&#x27;t lying, because they don&#x27;t say \"caused\".

It&#x27;s based on recall of if they had -frequent diet drinks- (edit: cutoff variable was one single diet drink per day) during pregnancy, so it might be being determined by like 15 people for the female side that were diet drink users and more for the controls, further divided by 6 different demographic subsets?

And in caution, stay below the one drink per day cutoff in the study, or even go to zero, when pregnant. Already, there are many guidelines on for for pregnant women that are based on abundance of caution rather than full knowledge of definite risk.TL;DR the scientific literature is not a textbook, it is the active working document and communication between scientists as they are working through the self-correcting scientific process. And the scientific literature should treat any single paper as a collection of data that is incomplete, may not be fully understood, and may have faulty conclusions attached to the data. It takes time and further evaluation do fully understand natural phenomenon.

It is one of the unifying threads in all of the research.I am autistic. I have&#x2F;experience the fever effects, so my symptoms significantly improve when I have a fever (yes, for the curious HN reader -- the exogenous compound that emulates this effect in susceptible individuals is sulforaphane, that is an entirely original post on its own, however.)Based on my experience with the fever effect, I would rate being neurotypical, or experiencing neurotypicality as significantly better than autism by itself. I can&#x27;t really quite elucidate how constantly overwhelming it is not having extra information filtered out, which I believe is the central cause of many downstream autistic effects. You can use models of cPTSD to show how many other symptoms (actively avoiding eye contact, perseverance, &#x27;special interests &#x27; [ mine has been deep learning, and also, ironically, deep learning too ;P I have contributed some impactful open-source work and will keep doing so as long as I can keep up funding to maintain the lifestyle ]) derive from this core. After all, from an information theoretic perspective, there needs to be some unifying set of &#x27;information&#x27; unifying a cluster of underlying symptoms in a disorder, the alternatives are just far too unlikely, especially with the specificity in such a high dimensional symptomatic space, (which is, btw, I believe, _the_ principle behind Occam&#x27;s razor).Several things in pregnancy that I&#x27;ve seen plausibly proposed as tied to autism: acetaminophen (!), _brain inflammation from viral infection during pregnancy_ (!), glyphosates (), general inflammation during pregnancy.Thefor glyphosates is that glyphosate itself is used as a wedge by oftentimes more-unethical companies to prove its use is &#x27;safe&#x27;. The compound itself breaks down in about 1-2 weeks -- extremely short, and is metabolized well by animals. Why is a problem?Aminomethylphosphonic acid. This is a byproduct of glyphosate, and is the main compound of concern. It, unlike, glyphosate, appears to build up in soil and is damaging in parts more than .5 ppm (!!!!). It appears to potentially be metabolized by bacteria, but still is an issue. Studies have shown toxicity, but compared to nearly every other compound out there that I&#x27;ve looked at, there is an uncomfortable dearth of studies about it, especially considering how ubiquitous it is. I remember hearing some rumble about Monsanto applying pressure to studies showing negative effects of Roundup, but I can&#x27;t speak anything concrete beyond that.People will often talk about the benefits of autism when I bring up the negative sides of things. I think everything is on a spectrum of &#x27;positive&#x27; and &#x27;negative&#x27; experiences. For example, some poisons actually are anti-inflammatory in some parts of the body, some beneficial medications are toxic in different ways. They&#x27;re just compounds, and autism is just a syndrome of being. My brain is autistic, not my soul.My experience has improved much in meditation, and in getting to a place where my sensations, thoughts, and beliefs, and, well, everything that one would consider what I \"am\" is just a series of experiences to me. Which is a different thing that living life as a person associated with a particular personality, set of emotions, or set of sensory experiences. I am still finding myself in the process of this change, but there is a certain euphoria in being able to just experience things as they come in, and then they go without infinitely looping, or causing pain. That is one of the big negatives to autism, everything is loud, especially pain. And due to increased neuroplasticity, the threshold for developing a syndrome of constant hypersensitivity&#x2F;fatigue&#x2F;pain&#x2F;etc is much higher.My lifestyle is adapted as much as possible to how my brain works, and I&#x27;ll keep doing so over time. It is hard when very basic things like washing the dishes can be overwhelming (sensitive to residual soap, sensory aspects of washing, change in activity has mental cost), or going from apartment to the outdoors for errands (change of environment, _so much noise_ (even with earplugs, a screaming child can take an extra 30 min - 1 hour to destim from), eye contact depending on the day, potential to miss an item but overwhelmed by lists). So the best adaptation for that is adapting lifestyle to still meet my basic needs (socialization, etc) while minimizing overwhelming costs.Not all of the above can be overwhelming, but the reason the above can be overwhelming is the &#x27;unknown&#x27; aspect of it, oftentimes. Because my brain doesn&#x27;t automatically filter information, I have to constantly do it manually. Think having to manually pedal a bike for 4-5 hours, of course you&#x27;ll be mentally fatigued!I am hoping to make some progress on finding a med+lifestyle combo to free up my mental budget for more things I want to do. At some point I might move out of sabbatical to a part time job, but I think that depends upon whether I can _sustainably_ do that while enjoying a life outside of that (previously it was 24&#x2F;7 survival mode -- crash on Sat&#x2F;Sun, keep going Monday. Burnout recipe!).One of the upsides is that I&#x27;m one of the best out there in the niche I&#x27;m in (neural network training speed + simplicity). As you can see, few things really do come for &#x27;free&#x27;, _especially_ where there&#x27;s some Pareto front involved. ;PPPPSo, needless to say, it&#x27;s an important issue. ;) ;&#x27;) replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

LEVY SCIENCESEP 29, 2023 7:00 AM A Revelation About Trees Is Messing With Climate Calculations Trees make clouds by releasing small quantities of vapors called “sesquiterpenes.” Scientists are learning more—and it’s making climate models hazy. PHOTOGRAPH: GETTY IMAGES EVERY YEAR BETWEEN September and December, Lubna Dada makes clouds. Dada, an atmospheric scientist, convenes with dozens of her colleagues to run experiments in a 7,000-gallon stainless steel chamber at CERN in Switzerland. “It's like science camp,” says Dada, who studies how natural emissions react with ozone to create aerosols that affect the climate. Clouds are the largest source of uncertainty in climate predictions. Depending on location, cloud cover can reflect sunlight away from land and ocean that would otherwise absorb its heat—a rare perk in the warming world. But clouds can also trap heat over Arctic and Antarctic ice. Scientists want to know more about what causes clouds to form, and if that effect is cooling or heating. And most of all, says Dada, “We want to know how we humans have changed clouds.” ADVERTISEMENT In the sky, aerosol particles attract water vapor or ice. When the tiny wet globs get large enough, they become seeds for clouds. Half of Earth’s cloud cover forms around stuff like sand, salt, soot, smoke, and dust. The other half nucleates around vapors released by living things or machines, like the sulfur dioxide that arises from burning fossil fuels. At CERN, scientists replicate that process by injecting the steel chamber with vapors that represent specific environments. (It’s called the CLOUD chamber, for Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets.) For example, they can mimic the gases found above cities. But Dada, who normally works at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, went to CERN to peer into the past. Her team of scientists from around the world wanted to recreate the air above forests, because a “pristine” atmosphere hints at what cloud formation was like before industrialization. “We need this comparison to the time when there were no human emissions,” she says, “so we can fix our climate models.” In a paper published this month in Science Advances, Dada’s team establishes a new heavy hitter in cloud creation: a kind of chemical released by trees. Trees emit natural volatiles like isoprene and monoterpenes, which can spark cloud-forming chemical reactions. Dada’s new work focuses on an overlooked class of less abundant volatiles called sesquiterpenes, which smell woody, earthy, citrusy, or spicy, depending on the molecule and type of plant or microbe that emits them. The team shows that sesquiterpenes are more effective than expected for seeding clouds. A mere 1-to-50 ratio of sesquiterpene to other volatiles doubled cloud formation. The role of trees in seeding clouds is important, because it suggests what the sky above some regions might be like if governments manage to tamp down sulfur emissions. In a world with less pollution, plants and trees will become more dominant drivers of cloud formation, an echo of the premodern world. This research could help refine estimates of what the atmosphere was like before industrialization. Maybe we’ve been undercounting the world’s aerosol population by overlooking a large portion of those that come from trees. If so, climate models will need retooling.

Lab tools have only recently become sensitive enough to understand which ones contribute the most. Many discoveries about sesquiterpenes are relatively recent. In 2010, researchers detected them near the Amazon’s forest floor. Higher up in the canopy, sesquiterpenes were harder to track. This suggested that ozone was turning sesquiterpenes into cloud-seeding aerosols. Dada reported a similar system in Finnish forests and peatlands last year. “We are seeing more and more because our instruments are much better now,” she says. “They are not only in the Amazon.” When Dada and her colleagues started the new study, they aimed to test sesquiterpenes’ cloud-making abilities by mimicking the air in a forest that hasn't been corrupted by anthropogenic emissions. They began with a baseline—measuring what happens after ionizing an atmospheric mix of the most common “biogenic” volatiles: isoprene and α-pinene, a monoterpene. This combination seeded clouds, as expected. Then, the team did the same and mixed in a sesquiterpene called β-caryophyllene. It comes from pine and citrus trees and smells like cracked pepper. Dada hypothesized that β-caryophyllene should react chemically, forming aerosols and eventually a cloud. She and her team stood in the control room monitoring 15 screens displaying real-time readouts of data like aerosol sizes and concentrations. They would know she was right if a graph of particle sizes on one of the screens changed color. It would grow and turn from blue to banana yellow as cloud seeds become more numerous. On the first run, the graph turned yellow. Dada was right. (“We were all screaming ‘Banana! Banana! Banana!’” she recalls.) Adding just 2 percent by volume of β-caryophyllene to the mix doubled cloud formation and caused particles to grow faster. It was the first experiment demonstrating how sesquiterpenes seed clouds. Dada says it showed that even though these are only a fraction of the compounds that trees exhale, “the contribution is huge.” “A little bit of sesquiterpene added has a very large effect,” says Jiwen Fan, an atmospheric scientist with Argonne National Lab not involved in the study. Even when sesquiterpenes create “ultrafine” aerosols they can still seed clouds and affect weather. In 2018, Fan showed that when huge rainclouds “ingest” ultrafine aerosols, they form new droplets that invigorate thunderstorms. To Fan, the new data suggests that sesquiterpenes may help better account for the global flow of aerosols. Aerosols make clouds deflect more heat away from Earth—an effect known as “radiative forcing.” (That’s the idea behind plots to geoengineer the atmosphere with aerosols: Artificially seeding clouds that can cool the ground.) More aerosols mean more reflective clouds that look whiter, last longer, and rain less. MOST POPULAR BUSINESS The End of Airbnb in New York AMANDA HOOVER GEAR How to Use ChatGPT’s New Image Features REECE ROGERS GEAR Lego Is a Company Haunted by Its Own Plastic CHRIS BARANIUK GEAR 40 Amazingly Addictive Couch Co-Op Games SIMON HILL But scientists have trouble simulating just how many aerosols should be accounted for in models. “It’s been a long-standing problem,” Fan says. “A lot of climate models overestimate anthropogenic aerosol forcing.” Perhaps that is because they are underestimating the prevalence of natural aerosols—from microbes, plants, and trees—before the industrial revolution. “Maybe what we're using as our reference point may actually not be as low-aerosol as we thought,” agrees Zuidema. By quantifying how trees make clouds, scientists could better predict the climate’s future—and past. Industrial emissions reduce some warming through radiative forcing, since sulfur aerosols can create reflective clouds. But if biogenic aerosols were more abundant than expected before industrialization, then the contributions from industry matter less. It’s hard to predict what this recalculation will tell us about global warming, because there are so many moving parts in a dynamic climate. For example, heat stress, extreme weather, and droughts cause plants to release more biogenic volatiles—which seed more clouds. Deforestation and heat stress are pushing treelines to migrate to higher altitudes and latitudes. That affects where clouds form. “It’s a feedback loop,” Dada says. “The climate is affecting the cloud formation, and the clouds are affecting the climate.” Better climate models will help scientists predict the best mitigations: “If we need more clouds, if we need less clouds,” Dada says. The catch, though, is that climate models are incredibly computationally demanding. It may not be easy to incorporate the physics of something as tiny as these tree aerosols. Dada is back at CERN this autumn for more tests. Her team now wants to see how anthropogenic emissions, like sulfur dioxide, affect the ability of plants to seed clouds. They might slow each other down—or speed each other up. Their goal is to broaden their conclusions to regions that aren’t as pristine as a forest, where there are many kinds of intermingled emissions. “We're trying to add anthropogenic factors, to have a more realistic view about almost everywhere around the world,” she says. Updated 9-29-2023 at 5:15 ET: This story was updated to correct a reference to Jiwen Fan's 2018 paper.

I’ve been learning recently about this phenomenon being known, but not understood.The most obvious indication was that logging leads to less rain, so it seems as though trees actually cause rain.One theory was that turbulence in the air above forests could trigger precipitation, and while that might still be a factor, this explanation is very clean and easy to understand.This is awesome in any case. I’ve been wanting to use the “trees cause rain” point in discussions about forestry and hydrology, but had to be careful because we only had correlations as far as I knew. This doesn’t fully solve that, but certainly helps explain and create a causative link.Also just incredible how evolution works. Of course trees cause rain, haha. I wonder if other plants such as grasses in vast plains have their own tricks to seed rain, or if their strategy is surviving drought extremely well. It’s all cool either way. reply xctr94 19 hours agoparentI’ve been reading agroforestry and permaculture books for a while — I’d love to get into farming —, and this has been known for ages.Even if not fully understood, it’s well known in agro that trees raise the humidity level of an area and create micro-climates that increase the amount of rain (e.g. of doing nut trees in a valley).I think… modern agriculture just forgot&#x2F;ignores ancient knowledge. reply aeroman 16 hours agorootparentThe increase in humidity is actually a different effect - evapotranspiration from trees is included in climate models (along with their response to increasing CO2 concentrations) [0].The effect in this article is more to do with the particulates that form from the chemical emitted from trees. The article doesn&#x27;t make it clear, but an increase in tree particulates (known as aerosols) would actually cause less rain.Almost all cloud droplets form on an aerosol particle, so the cloud droplets in a cloud with more aerosols are on average smaller (as the water is spread out over more droplets). These smaller droplets take longer to grow large enough to form rain, an effect which is thought to decrease the amount of precipitation in some regions (although by a small amount).This effect is also included in climate models, but the sources of aerosol (such as from trees) are more uncertain [1], producing the uncertainty in future climate projections.[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gmd.copernicus.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;4&#x2F;677&#x2F;2011&#x2F;gmd-4-677-201...[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature12674 reply steve_adams_86 18 hours agorootparentprevWithout a doubt, and it’s well known in urban planning and landscaping too. But in a discussion about why industry might be harmful, not having facts to back yourself up makes your case effectively irrelevant. Even pointing to countless reforestation projects with heaps of positive precipitation and hydrological data is no help; as long as the mechanism isn’t clear, people who want to maintain business as usual will not listen.So, information like this is a huge help and a step towards having a more crystallized picture of why forests are crucial to hydrology. reply dr_dshiv 17 hours agorootparentprevTerpenes from trees also produce OH which converts methane to CO2. No idea whether this has a big effect, but I find it fascinating. reply philipov 19 hours agorootparentprevAre you telling me the Rain Follows The Plow folks were actually on to something? reply mooreds 18 hours agorootparentSolid joke :) .Unfortunately, you typically don&#x27;t plant trees with a plow. reply Avshalom 18 hours agorootparentprevlocal humidity levels is just transpiration, which yeah in a valley trapping the humidity can create rain but that&#x27;s not the same as this cloud seeding mechanism. reply Loughla 12 hours agorootparentprevModern agriculture didn&#x27;t forget. It chose differently because quantity is the only measure of success. Trees causing rain has to be substantially less efficient in the short term than irrigation. reply steve_adams_86 8 hours agorootparentThe trouble is that reduced forest leads to reduced rain, and irrigation often reduces ground water which is replenished even slower than before. It accelerates water losses a lot faster than anyone expected. reply brnaftr361 19 hours agorootparentprevI bet there&#x27;s folk tales that parallel it with angry forest spirits, too. Explaining the unknown with anthropomorphization. reply meristohm 18 hours agoparentprevTrees are a collection of straws into the ground, sucking up water with negative pressure due to evaporation through the leaves. It&#x27;s cool that there are cloud-seeding chemicals released as well.Forests smell and feel much better that clear-cut spaces, I know that much. I&#x27;d rather the USDA and Forest Service adopt more-sustainable logging practices, for leased land especially (where the economics equation currently favors clear-cutting), like the Menominee in northern Wisconsin. reply jazzyjackson 18 hours agorootparenti&#x27;ve also wondered how much energy is absorbed by trees, I know on a 100 degree day the coolness of a shady grove well outcompetes the shade of a simple picnic shelter reply Avshalom 18 hours agorootparentthere&#x27;s a couple things going on there. Photsynthesis isn&#x27;t absorbing much its ~1-2% efficiency (so mostly just waste heat) but plants are mostly water which has a high heat capacity so it warms slower than a kiln dried wood structure. Wood&#x2F;bark is also way less reflective than concrete and (living) plants respond to heat by opening up pores and letting water evaporate out of them (basically sweating) which can lower the dry bulb temperature (especially if there&#x27;s any breeze). reply nostromo 16 hours agorootparentTrees also act as thermal sinks. They transfer surface heat down into their roots, where it is cool underground. reply eep_social 16 hours agorootparentMore precisely, the temperature underground is very stable. At 8-12 feet there is little to no variation over the course of a year. So in a cold season it will be warmer underground than ambient (this is why foundations are dug “below the frost line”) while the opposite is true during a warm season. reply sampo 16 hours agorootparentprevIn infrared, green leaves are more reflective than bare soil or concrete. reply luma 15 hours agorootparentprevWould evaporative cooling due to transpiration have a significant impact? reply jazzyjackson 18 hours agoparentprevtrees basically perform cloud-seeding by releasing micro-droplets of oils into the air\"climate: a new story\" by charles eisenstein is a great resource on an alternative understanding to climate change then simply \"CO2 bad\", which he presents as a red herring to ecosystem destructionconventional wisdom is apparently \"fair weather leads to more biomass\" when the reality might be \"more biomass leads to fair weather\" as every ecosystem acts as a chemical and energetic buffer reply steve_adams_86 18 hours agorootparentThis is really interesting to consider, and I hadn’t before. It lends a lot more potential weight and credibility to the idea that rewilding plains (for example), thus increasing the biomass there, would have significant climate benefits. This falls deep into the “We can’t know that” category, but I’m a fairly large proponent of leaving more land alone and letting nature do what it does. At the moment, economic activity like grazing cows seems like it could be a net negative since it’s clearly harming the environment while also preventing natural landscapes from establishing, which could have significant ecological benefits.The idea that biomass can bring stability and better conditions is certainly supported by my aquarium experience, though it’s a closed system. If you limit the number of species, water parameters will swing all over the place. Add more species (particularly plants and micro flora&#x2F;fauna), and the water becomes clearer and cleaner. Add some small crustaceans, snails, or other animals which love algae and it’ll get even cleaner, and their populations will self-maintain quite well. Add some tiny fish and they will live on the algae, micro fauna, offspring of the shrimp, etc. These systems work well, but they need a huge amount of plants and tiny creatures, bacteria, and small animals to groom and maintain things. Without them, it’ll crash and swing all over until just about everything is dead.If we imagine the world as a giant aquarium where we inhibit the micro flora and micro fauna, bacteria, and other balances, it certainly seems possible that restoring this would improve all kinds of factors like water and air quality. reply runsWphotons 18 hours agorootparentIf you graze animals the right way you can also increase biomass&#x2F;help the ecosystem. reply steve_adams_86 8 hours agorootparentThat’s a big if. The vast majority of animals raised in North America aren’t grazed sustainably, especially if you exclude Canada. It’s kind of like saying you can drive without emissions when 99% of the world is driving gas cars, only in this case, there’s no trend towards grazing sustainably and no reason to believe it will start happening (whereas vehicles likely will continue trending towards electric motors). I just can’t think of a better analogy at the moment, but hopefully it makes sense. Proper grazing seems unlikely to ever be adopted on a broad scale, so it’s unlikely to matter that it can be done better. reply myshpa 13 hours agorootparentprevNot really true.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newrepublic.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;163735&#x2F;myth-regenerative-ran...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grist.org&#x2F;climate-energy&#x2F;cattle-grazing-is-a-climate...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature25138https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk&#x2F;publications&#x2F;grazed-and-co...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plantbasednews.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;environment&#x2F;george-monbiot-r...“So any story that says it’s good to be farming these livestock, it’s good to be eating these livestock, is a story which justifies among the most devastating processes on Earth,” he said. “It is climate science denial.”Monbiot linked this denial to the interests of major corporations like McDonald’s, General Mills, JBS, and the Murdoch Network, who he says have “backed and weaponized” the idea that grazing cattle is environmentally beneficial. “The story is false,” he said. “When you make a grand claim such as this one, that livestock can mitigate climate change, either you produce the evidence for that claim or if you cannot produce the evidence you withdraw the claim. The evidence has not been produced, the claim does not stand.” reply steve_adams_86 8 hours agorootparentFor what it’s worth, there are other studies indicating this as well. There isn’t good data suggesting we can graze animals on a large scale and increase biomass in a meaningful way compared to other options. The trouble is that other options inevitably include “stop eating meat”, and people don’t like to hear this. reply eep_social 15 hours agorootparentprev> aquarium experienceIs this the Walstad Method? reply steve_adams_86 8 hours agorootparentYes!

If we have to wait until we have ironclad proof that we shouldn&#x27;t be wrecking things, we are A. allowing our caution to be permissive of recklessness, and B. creating a situation similar to the asymmetry of spreading bullshit -- it takes far longer to prove something is harmful than it takes to switch over to some other equally (or more) destructive practice.Sorry, I&#x27;ll step off my soapbox now. Not even sure if you were discussing these things in the context of conservation.It is indeed really cool stuff! The natural world continues to throw surprise after surprise at us, and the more we learn the more it looks like it really is Fern Gully operating in the wilds of our wonderful earth.Anecdotally, grasses do seem to put off some smell at times, including preceding a heavy rain. To me, they don&#x27;t seem as as heady and \"luscious\" like the rich floral terpenes from a forest (then again I&#x27;m from the PNW, so I haven&#x27;t spent as much time in the grasslands). I wonder if it is more soil bacteria that the grasses are in symbiosis with that do the heavy lifting in terms of rain seeding. Neat to wonder about. reply nuc1e0n 18 hours agoprevWow.

These react with ozone, creating compounds that scatter blue light.I am not certain, but I believe this fog helps plays a role (in combination with specific needle microstructures and density) in the formation of water condensation on conifer needles, which they can absorb, either via drip or more directly when it collects toward the base of the needles.

Based on reading a handful of IPCC papers, a similar method is used in climate science for the most important parameters, but is severely limited by the resources needed to rerun the models and the sheer number of parameters.Basically, any uncertainty due to complexity is mostly ignored and any skeptics who point this out are tarred as \"deniers.\" Combine this with the fact that generally climate scientists do not produce any point predictions to verify models, and I think you can safely ignore many climate models. The papers that do produce explicit measurable predictions tend to find an interesting result by stretching the models to fit a narrative, eg: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41477-018-0263-1 reply eachro 19 hours agoprevYishan Wong&#x27;s startup Terra formation(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terraformation.com&#x2F;) is trying to tackle climate change with this more or less as the underlying thesis. reply galangalalgol 19 hours agoparentI love forests, any sort, but reforestation the right way, as Terra seems to support, takes more time than some are saying we have.

It is actively harmful to allow someone to say that since they paid $10 to plant a tree that may or may not absorb a ton of carbon over the next century, that offsets the literal ton of carbon that they just emitted yesterday (and made a lot more than $10 off of). Just tax the carbon and put the proceeds towards ecological restoration, that accomplishes the same thing without letting anyone falsely claim they have offset their emissions, and allows the government to set the price to something meaningful. reply shironandonon_ 18 hours agoprevCanada had record wild fires in 2023 and now I’m wondering how this effect will snowball. reply steve_adams_86 18 hours agoparentI am too.

Even if it&#x27;s true, this message just numbs people.The fact is that to a certain point the Earth has climate balancing mechanisms that we have little to no understanding about. Why do I say this? Because if it didn&#x27;t, we would already be Venus. The climate on Earth has ranged from ice to the equator to being much warmer than it is even now. So why hasn&#x27;t this runaway climate change happened in the last 4 billion years?Now for a long time the standard retort has been the pace of climate change is different now. Not so. Look at Dansgaard-Oeschger (\"D-O\") cycles [1]:> One of the most surprising findings was that the shifts from cold stadials to the warm interstadial intervals occurred in a matter of decades, with air temperatures over Greenland rapidly warming 8 to 15°CThis occurred multiple times over the last 100,000 years.So rather than focus on this doom and gloom scenario, consider that climate change isgoing to kill a lot of people (through famine, flooding, areas becoming uninhabitable and the upheaval from all the resulting migration). Even then, we as a society constantly make tradeoffs of personal convenience where the cost is people dying. Sometimes a lot of people. Even apart from dying, our society cannot exist as it is without the exploitation of the Global South. We as a society have decided we&#x27;re fine with people people being paid pennies to work themselves to death in death trap factories to make our lives possible.It&#x27;s not surprising that trees seed clouds.

It involved evaluating the performance of 758 consultants, which make up 7% of the individual contributor workforce of the company. The tasks spanned a consultant’s daily work, including creativity, analytical thinking, writing proficiency, and persuasiveness. Key Findings For tasks within the AI frontier, ChatGPT-4 significantly increased performance, boosting speed by over 25%, human-rated performance by over 40%, and task completion by over 12%. The study introduces the concept of a “jagged technological frontier,” where AI excels in some tasks but falls short in others. Two distinct patterns of AI use emerged: “Centaurs,” who divided and delegated tasks between themselves and the AI, and “Cyborgs,” who integrated their workflow with the AI. Shifting the Debate The paper argues that the focus should move beyond the binary decision of adopting or not adopting AI. Instead, we should evaluate the value of different configurations and combinations of humans and AI for various tasks within the knowledge workflow.

These tasks spanned various domains. Specifically, they can be categorized into four types: creativity (e.g., “Propose at least 10 ideas for a new shoe targeting an underserved market or sport.”), analytical thinking (e.g., “Segment the footwear industry market based on users.”), writing proficiency (e.g., “Draft a press release marketing copy for your product.”), and persuasiveness (e.g., “Pen an inspirational memo to employees detailing why your product would outshine competitors.”).\"Here is the GPT response to the first task: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;db7556f7-6036-4b3d-a61a-9cd253...A confident GPT hallucination is almost indistinguishable from typical management consulting material... reply highwaylights 22 hours agoparent1) Your ideas are bad.2) Spreadsheets exist.3) No-one cares about your marketing copy.4) No-one finds your c-suite babble inspirational.This is almost perfect input to an LLM exactly because of how low value it is in the first place. reply johndhi 16 hours agorootparentOften the benefit of management consultants is they help the company feel better about firing or laying off people.Actually a robot would be perfect at that. No one likes doing layoffs but chat gpt won&#x27;t mind reply emidln 11 hours agorootparent> Actually a robot would be perfect at that. No one likes doing layoffs but chat gpt won&#x27;t mindMaybe chatgpt should be trained to care. reply djtango 21 hours agorootparentprevHa it&#x27;s fun to dunk on management consultants but I think the magic is they are like pop music producers.Somehow they&#x27;re able to make the C suite hoover up LLM shovelware the same way top producers can take super obvious music and sell I V vi IV but when we try the same chords it&#x27;s uninspired and no one wants to listen to it reply mlinhares 19 hours agorootparentIt’s insane that people think producing pop music is easy. Competing on the pop music market is a cutthroat business with a lot of competition and the good ones get their price back in gold.When Scorpions wanted to be resurrected they hired Desmond Child to produce them and he absolutely crushed. These people are very good at what they do and there are very few of them. reply somenameforme 17 hours agorootparentThe perception is that success in the field is driven largely by factors other than the quality of music. It&#x27;d be extremely interesting to see a Richard Bachman &#x2F; Steven King [1] type experiment with a Desmond Child, Max Martin, or whoever else.Keep their existence completely out of the picture, and have them scout and produce talented no-name, but require the no-name to use only the sort of avenues that would be openly available to anybody&#x2F;everybody: YouTube, Tunecore, social media, etc. Would the new party now be meaningfully likely to have a real breakthrough?[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Bachman reply majormajor 16 hours agorootparentA lot of the public believes that what you&#x27;re talking about already happens, for what it&#x27;s worth. \"Industry plants.\"Something can be extremely catchy yet widely panned as low quality in music, so even within \"just the music\" there are several dimensions at play regardless of marketing, etc. Such as whether it&#x27;s timed right - are there enough people ready for that song at that time?The idea that \"most people will just listen and be fans of whatever the big media companies put out there\" doesn&#x27;t stand up much examination or conversation with \"most people.\"People do often make breakthroughs on soundcloud, TikTok, whatever - do you think having the invisible support of a Max Martin would lower their chances? You&#x27;d need to do your experiment a hundred times or thousand times or so before you could really compare the success rate of your plants to the rest of the crowd, but it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that they wouldn&#x27;t have an advantage. The music industry isn&#x27;t known for their charity, if they could get away with not paying those people without another label beating them in the market, why would they? reply lukas099 17 hours agorootparentprev> other than the quality of the musicThe ‘quality’ of a pop song is how much popular appeal it has. That’s the basis of the genre, even reflected in the name. reply MetaWhirledPeas 16 hours agorootparentBut the qualities of the song are not what make it popular. With \"pop\" music there are far more important forces at play, namely the quantity and quality of the song&#x27;s publicity. One of the big things you get with a big time producer is big time connections and a lot of \"airplay\" in mixes, commercials, TV shows, etc. You also open the door for more collaborations with other popular artists.Occasionally you&#x27;ll have a song that breaks through due to sheer catchy-ness, but this is the exception rather than the rule. reply telotortium 17 hours agorootparentprevIn practice you need both. Max Martin himself has produced and songwritten for plenty of no-names, but for an artist that has the requisite marketing support, bad or uncatchy pop songs can absolutely ruin an artist who would otherwise make it big. reply Nition 15 hours agorootparentThere is a third factor; the quality of the mix. People like Serban Ghenea[0] get hired to make the sound world class.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Serban_Ghenea reply WalterBright 13 hours agorootparentWhich is why Michael Jackson hired Quincy Jones to fix his music. reply highwaylights 15 hours agorootparentprev“Just Blaaaaazzzee”This is admittedly very niche but I see your point.Also: I remember a time in the early 00s when almost every song on MTV began with Rodney Jerkins whispering “DARKCHILD” over the music.Ultimately isn’t it just branding though? Would you buy Coca-Cola if it had some other label on the bottle? Or watch Mission Impossible 14 starring Some Dude? I’m not sure there’s a lot of fields where things are really competing on their own merits rather than the accumulation of their past successes. reply hammock 16 hours agorootparentprevDefine quality reply WendyTheWillow 18 hours agorootparentprevIt’s also insane people think running a large business is easy, or that management consultants aren’t worth what they’re paid. reply jack_riminton 18 hours agorootparentWorth here is the key word. I did an MBA which was specifically designed to get people into consulting, we did many consulting projects for real multinantionals and the key lesson was: \"What does the hidden client want?\"i.e. someone has been tasked with getting some consultants to come up with a suggestion, the key question however is what does THEIR boss want to hear. If you can work that out and give it to them then you&#x27;ve earned your &#x27;worth&#x27; reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentWell, there&#x27;s also the case where some internal engineering and product management think they have the right answer. But it may be a literally bet the company sort of thing. (Especially outside the software realm where once the bus has left the station it&#x27;s not turning around.)Now I know there are people here whose reaction is that executive management should just shut up and listen to what the worker bees say. But it actually doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable to me (and I&#x27;ve been on the product management end of things in a case like this) to have some outside perspective from some people who are mostly pretty smart to nod their heads and say this seems sensible.As a bonus they create big spreadsheets that make the business planning types happy and keep them out from underfoot. reply hcks 16 hours agorootparentprevWow I’m sure someone that paid some money for an MBA and then stopped at the gate of an entry level position has expertise in this matter. reply marcosdumay 17 hours agorootparentprevWell, if it was that hard, chatGPT wouldn&#x27;t be able to help them. reply j45 17 hours agorootparentprevI hope someone builds a management consultant gpt to find out.Until then, our leaders, experts and institutions were few of those things during the pandemic.How large businesses are built and run has changed faster and more in the past few years than the principled predictions of a business’ future vector that are based on lagging indicators.It also depends on how cookie cut the management consultant frameworks and “toolkits” are.It’s no coincidence that it’s mostly juniors doing so much of the work and billing. New or average talent is more profitable per hour to bill than experience.Financially, if $7-8 of every $10 for improvement went to a management consulting undertaking, the other $2-3 is what’s left over for the rest without even knowing. This would be the coup, if this were true.The fun part to watch for is is tech people will be able to learn business easier than business people will be able to learn and apply tech when they can’t understand it’s capabilities or possibilities beyond speaking points.The technical analyst will M&A the business analyst. Maybe they learn to extract Management Consultant type value too. reply RandomLensman 17 hours agorootparentMangement consultants get comparatively small money from (large) firms. The total revenues going to McK, BCG, and Bain are only about $30B annually. reply WalterBright 13 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s the story of David Cassidy. He got cast in the Partridge Family (the rock band family) largely because of his looks and his mother (Shirley Jones). His voice was set to be dubbed for the songs, but it turned out he had a golden throat. (The rest of the cast, besides Jones, could neither play nor sing.)The producers hired top shelf songwriters to write the songs, and several hit albums were produced. (It really is good music, despite being bubblegum.)Cassidy, however, decided that he had songwriting talent and chafed. He eventually left the show, and with the megabucks he earned on the show, produced albums. They&#x27;re terrible.The same thing happened to the Monkees. reply WalterBright 13 hours agorootparentprevCheck out the movie \"The Wrecking Crew\". It&#x27;s about studio musicians fixing, rewriting, playing, and singing the music created by the \"bands\" you&#x27;ve all heard of, so the albums were good.Then, the bands belatedly had to learn how to sing and play in order to go on tour.I think about The Wrecking Crew whenever I hear the sob stories about bands being underpaid and the producers reaping the lion&#x27;s share of the profits. reply j45 17 hours agorootparentprevIs there a HN for management consultants?Depending you ask pop music is a formula and that one dude from Sweden has the formula perfected. reply pydry 20 hours agorootparentprevThe magic is in:A) Forming cross company cliques (a lot of C suite is ex consultant and they scratch each others&#x27; backs).B) ego stroking and typical sales (\"this executive is a visionary who must be furnished with top quality steak and strippers\")C) Letting you know on the sly what their other customers are doing that seems to be working.D) Providing industrial grade ass cover for decisions that the C suite want to make but are afraid to make by themselves (like layoffs). reply jaybrendansmith 18 hours agorootparentSo much of it is about information awareness. Like it or not, these consultants and analysts talk to hundreds of C-levels all the time. They become excellent information sources about what is working, what is not working, and about business risks that a particular executive may not be aware of. Yes, there is the potential for group-think, and the bad ones shill for a particular technology or process without any basis in success. But the good ones provide guidance to the executives that might be working in information-free areas, making them aware of concepts, technologies, and processes that either present risks to their businesses or represent good practices they really should adopt. It&#x27;s easy to be cynical about this, but there are many good business leaders who are not analytical, and are in need of this kind of guidance. reply pydry 18 hours agorootparent>It&#x27;s easy to be cynical about thisIt&#x27;s probably easier to assume that their job is to provide objective expert advice since thats what they say they do.I&#x27;m being realistic here, not cynical. reply mistrial9 17 hours agorootparentthe comment might be spot-on for some companies and industry, but really.. not all business culture is the same. By painting \"all management\" in this light you are showing the same one-dimensional thinking that is being criticized here.. reply pydry 16 hours agorootparentDid you think I was making some comment about the millions of businesses and many governments that don&#x27;t use the services of these consultants?I can assure you I wasn&#x27;t. reply jamiegreen 20 hours agorootparentprevDon’t underestimate the ass covering.I recon 60% of management consulting work is just to ass cover for a director with no conviction reply corysama 19 hours agorootparentThe more expensive the cover the better.“I paid a world-class consulting consultant company top dollar to vet this idea and they produced ton of documents about how great it was. And, yet it failed. But, I’m not at fault here. What more would you have had me do?”There was an article on HN years ago about top grade from Harvard-like schools being sucked into consulting companies and discovering their job was to be paid tons of money writing reports that support whatever the exec of the moment wanted to hear. reply matheusmoreira 17 hours agorootparent> their job was to be paid tons of money writing reports that support whatever the exec of the moment wanted to hearSounds like an extremely nice job. reply p1esk 15 hours agorootparentNot really. reply matheusmoreira 13 hours agorootparentWell, depends on how much money is \"tons of money\". reply acover 18 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a link? I can&#x27;t find it. reply pydry 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I think that&#x27;s the majority of the grunt work done by junior consultants.I don&#x27;t doubt that if the high level decision agreed upon is \"more layoffs because AI\" and they were asked for a 60 page report to justify it that ChatGPT would help inordinately in fleshing it out with something that sounds fairly plausible. reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a lot of boilerplate that actually takes quite a while to write from scratch. If the people involved have a pretty good idea in their heads of what fundamentals are fairly sensible and which are probably sort of irrelevant or even wrong, something like ChatGPT is actually pretty good at churning out at least a decent pre-draft that can save quite a bit of time. I&#x27;ve used it a fair bit for introductory background that I can certainly clean up faster than I could put together from scratch. reply FrustratedMonky 20 hours agorootparentprevOr, you have a break out hit like the Spice Girls.If it was so bad, then why do people listen?There is still a market.Does the market suck? Full of idiots?Your argument ends up being that successful things are bad, because humans are just idiots and thus if something is successful it is because it is just liked by idiots.As much as I might agree generally, it doesn&#x27;t get you far. reply norir 16 hours agorootparent> Your argument ends up being that successful things are bad, because humans are just idiots and thus if something is successful it is because it is just liked by idiots.I mean I&#x27;m not sure that this is that far from the truth in some domains, though it depends on how you define idiocy. There is, for example, a market for demolition derbies. Of course all of us are idiots in some ways so we should be careful about whom we disparage. reply fragmede 18 hours agorootparentprevBack then, payola meant that people listened whatever the labels wanted to make popular. it&#x27;s very much an intentional, manufacturered factory. reply warkdarrior 17 hours agorootparentHoney, everything is an \"intentional, manufactured factory\". Or do you just wake up every morning and say to yourself \"let me type some random code and see what kind of software comes out\"?? reply im3w1l 17 hours agorootparentprevSounds like you are tunnel visioning in your analysis of the music? There are so many more things to it than the chord progression.On the songwriting side, there&#x27;s the lyrics which have both a phonetic and a semantic component. There&#x27;s also the fact that many people will mishear the lyrics and their evaluation of them will be based on the mishearing. There&#x27;s the melody. Does it work together with the chords to highlight the key parts of the lyrics?Then there&#x27;s the performance where there are a million ways to stand out or flop. Loudness, timbre, timing and even detuning can all be used for expression. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 16 hours agorootparentAre you trying to tell me that \"starbucks lovers\" was intentional? reply iterminate 21 hours agoparentprev> A confident GPT hallucination is almost indistinguishable from typical management consulting material...If you&#x27;re measuring based on output, sure, but... the value of any knowledge worker is primarily driven by the input, that is, a client doesn&#x27;t want \"10 ideas\" they want \"10 [valuable] ideas [informed by the understanding of the business and the market they&#x27;re operating in]\". If a management consultant said \"boat shoes\" in response to this question they would not have a client much longer.You could apply this same nonsense task to software engineering, i.e: ask ChatGPT to \"write 10 lines of code\" and it&#x27;ll be indistinguishable from the code we churn out day after day. reply flir 21 hours agorootparentSo you ask for 20 ideas and filter. Even if you throw away 19, it&#x27;s still useful. reply fragmede 18 hours agorootparentEven if you throw all of them away, the point is the human is simply more effective in their role. Just breaking the ice, the writer&#x27;s block; anything to get out of the creative rut that we all fall in, is worth its weight in GPUs. reply flir 16 hours agorootparentThank you, you express it much better than I can. \"Diabetic-Friendly Shoes\" from the above list immediately had me thinking in half a dozen different directions at once. reply genman 21 hours agorootparentprevNot necessarily if the remaining one idea is still garbage. reply flir 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s the purpose of filtering them. reply dmbche 19 hours agorootparentHow many turds should i filter though until I suddenly find gold? reply genghisjahn 19 hours agorootparentHow bad do you want the gold? reply pohl 19 hours agorootparentprevProbably should have chosen a valuable but inedible element. reply jprete 21 hours agorootparentprevThey’re all bad ideas, though. reply shakow 19 hours agoparentprev> Target: Dog Walkers> Features: Built-in waste bag dispenserI&#x27;m not yet sure whether I hate it or love it.> Target: Visually Impaired Individuals> Features: Haptic feedbackHaptic shoes, how revolutionary! reply cgriswald 17 hours agorootparentI’m just imagining stepping in dog poop and my only way to help myself is also covered in dog poop.The shoes seem to give you two options for cleaning up your dogs poop: (1) Bend down twice, once for the bag, once for the poop. (2) Bend down once nice and close to the poop and get a bigger whiff than otherwise.I’m just not looking for ways to interact manually with my shoes more than I have to… reply datadrivenangel 16 hours agorootparentprevI saw a built-in waste bag dispenser recently while helping walk a friend&#x27;s dog, and honestly it was pretty convenient. reply riskable 16 hours agorootparentYes but how much more convenient would it be with haptic feedback‽ reply Stinky_Lisa 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah some of those have potential lol reply segfaultex 17 hours agoparentprev> A confident GPT hallucination is almost indistinguishable from typical management consulting material...Sounds perfect for both Harvard and those linked to the institution.My employer has hired McKinsey a few times, known to recruit from HYP, and their output has been subpar to say the least. My entire experience with these institutions has been fairly uniform in that regard.I know it’s anecdotal. But it feels like there’s a lot of confirmation bias with these sorts of studies. reply noelwelsh 20 hours agoparentprevThe GPT responses read like they were lifted from MAD magazine. reply mnd999 15 hours agoparentprevMakes sense. The bullshit generator can replace professional bullshitters. reply smeej 22 hours agoparentprevSeveral of those aren&#x27;t even new. reply Hippocrates 18 hours agoprevThis is hilarious. As impressive as GPT-3&#x2F;4 has been at writing, what&#x27;s more shocking is just how bullshity-y human writing is.. And a \"business consultant\" is the epitome of a role requiring bullshit writing. Chat GPT could certainly out business-consultant the very best business consultants.Sometimes to be taken seriously at work, you need to take some concise idea or data and fluff it up into a multiple pages or a slide deck JUST so that others can immediately see how much work you put in.The ideal role for chatgpt at this moment is probably to take concise writings and to expand it into something way larger and full of filler. On the receiving end, people will endure your long-winded document or slide deck, recognize you \"put in the work\", and then feed it back into chatGPT to get the original key points summarized. reply klabb3 16 hours agoparent> As impressive as GPT-3&#x2F;4 has been at writing, what&#x27;s more shocking is just how bullshity-y human writing is..Yeah. Most people have focused on what LLMs can do, but I think it’s equally if not more interesting what can they not do, and why?When we say LLMs can generate text we’re painting brush strokes as broad as a 10-lane highway. Apparently we have quite limited vocabulary about what writing actually is, and specifically what categories and levels exist.For instance, it’s fun (and in my view completely expected) to see that courteous emails, LinkedIn inspirational spam, corp-speech etc, GPT outperforms humans with flying colors, on the first attempt too! Whereas if you’re asking for the next book of Game of Thrones or any well-written literature it falls flat – incredibly boring, generic, full of platitudes and empty arcs and characters.We have to start mapping the field of writing to a better conceptual space. Currently it seems like we can’t even differentiate between the equivalent of arithmetic and abstract algebra. reply lambdaba 16 hours agorootparentTo me it looks very analogous to AI-generated \"art\", it&#x27;s very easy to generate some generally esthetically pleasing visuals, but the depth of the art stays in proportion with the input effort... Which is often not much. All of this shouldn&#x27;t be very surprising really, and there&#x27;s still a lot of usefulness to it, if only for depreciating the low-quality copy-paste productions and making the really unique and novel ones even more valuable. reply p1esk 15 hours agorootparentWhat is “depth of the art”? reply airstrike 15 hours agorootparentHah. Good question. You could write a whole grad level thesis on it. reply lambdaba 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I couldn&#x27;t say, it&#x27;s just \"vibes\" I guess, just like the filler text produced by business consultants it&#x27;s just not something that I feel would be missed if lost. It all looks the same at some level even when it&#x27;s superficially different. Midjourney especially is very uniform in this regard, everything looks great, but it&#x27;s kind of flat at the same time. reply amccloud 10 hours agorootparentprevstorytelling and perceived value replyAdamCraven 21 hours agoprevWell, they buried the lede with this one. Using LLMs were better for some tasks and actually made it worse for others.The first task was a generalist task (\"inside the frontier\" as they refer to it), which I&#x27;m not surprised has improved performance, as it purposely made to fall into an LLM&#x27;s areas of strength: research into well-defined areas where you might not have strong domain knowledge. This also is the mainstay of early consultants&#x27; work, in which they are generalists in their early careers – usually as business analysts or similar – until they become more valuable and specialise later on.LLMs are strong in this area of general research because they have generalised a lot of information. But this generalisation is also its weakness. A good way to think about it is it&#x27;s like a journalist of research. If you&#x27;ve ever read a newspaper, you often think you&#x27;re getting a lot of insight. However, as soon as you read an article on an area of your specialisation, you realise they&#x27;ve made many flaws with the analysis; they don&#x27;t understand your subject anywhere near the level you would.The second task (outside the frontier) required analysis of a spreadsheet, interviews and a more deeply analytical take with evidence to back it up. These are all tasks that LLMs aren&#x27;t strong at currently. Unsurprisingly, the non-LLM group scored 84.5%, and between 60% and 70.6% for LLM users.The takeaway should be that LLMs are great for generalised research but less good for specialist analytical tasks. reply doitLP 20 hours agoparentI was thinking about this last night. It’s a new version of Gell-Mann amnesia. I call it LLm-man amnesia.When I ask a programming question, chat GPT hallucinates something about 20% of the time and I can only tell because I’m skilled enough to see it. For all the other domains I ask it questions if I should assume at least as much hallucination and incorrect information. reply utsuro 19 hours agorootparentI see this as for drill-down thinking from a broad -> specific concept AI seems to be helpful when supplementing specialist work. However like you both mentioned: when needing more focused and integrated answers AI tends hinders performance.However as the paper noted, when working within AIs areas of strength it improved not only efficiency but the quality of the work as well (accounting for the hallucinations). As you mentioned:> When I ask a programming question, chat GPT hallucinates something about 20% of the time and I can only tell because I’m skilled enough to see itThis matches their Centaur approach, delineating between AI and one’s own skills for a task which—with generalized work—seems to fair better than not using AI at all. reply RandomLensman 19 hours agoparentprevLLMs are broadly good at things that average knowledge workers are good at or can be trained to be good at reasonably quickly. reply genman 21 hours agoparentprevComparing LLM to journalists is good insight. reply benreesman 21 hours agoprevLLMs are stunningly good at language tasks: almost all of what us old-timers called NLP is just crushed these days. Summarization, Q&A, sentiment, the list goes on and on. Truly remarkable stuff.And where there isn’t a bright line around “fact”, and where it doesn’t need to come together like a Pynchon novel, the generative stuff is smoking hot: short-form fiction, opinion pieces, product copy? Massive productivity booster, you can prototype 20 ideas in one minute.But that’s about where we are: lift natural language into a latent space with some clear notion of separability, do some affine (ish) transformations, lower back down.Fucking impressive for a computer. But if it can really carry water for an expensive Penn grad?You’re paying for something other than blindingly insightful product strategy. reply Jeff_Brown 21 hours agoparentI wonder how long it takes AI to get good at law. Right now the verbal tasks it excels at are similar to the artistic ones: namely, solving problems with enormous solution spaces that are robust to small perturbations. That is, change a good picture of an angry tree man slightly and it&#x27;s still probably a good picture of an angry tree man. reply qingcharles 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve tried using a lot for writing motions. It can actually do a pretty decent job of writing motions, and it can come up with some arguments that you might not have thought of.

It can&#x27;t be a doctor. reply benreesman 7 hours agorootparentRelatedly, a lot of the cap R fanfic crowd points at stuff pretty clearly lifted out of the Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect or whatever.And it’s dope that it can do that!But let’s keep our heads about what it is. reply aofjfdgnionio 18 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t buy it. LLMs cannot do anything reliably, no matter how constrained the domain. Their outputs are of acceptable quality when back to a person who will use their human brain to paper over the cracks. People can recognize when the output is garbage, figure out minor ambiguities, and subconsciously correct minor factual or logical errors. But I would never feed LLM results directly into another computer program This rules out most traditional NLP tasks. reply benreesman 18 hours agorootparentI’m sympathetic to the instinct to push back on the absurd boosterism (these things are an existential threat to humanity this year), it’s fucking annoying.But they can do plenty of useful stuff reliably.

All LLM output looks to be good quality except when it’s output you’re an expert in.People who have no background in writing or editing think LLMs will revolutionize those fields. Actual writers and editors take one look at LLM output and can see it’s basically valueless because the time taken to fix it would be equivalent to the time taken to write it in the first place.Similarly people who are poor programmers or have only a surface level understanding of a topic (especially management types who are trying to appear technical) look at LLM output and think it’s ready to ship but good programmers recognize that the output is broken in so many ways large and small that it’s not worth the time it would take to fix compared to just writing from scratch. reply hutzlibu 21 hours agorootparentLLMs are not worthless for programming. You just cannot expect it to ship a full programm for you, but for generating functions with limited scope, I found it very useful. How to make use of a new and common libary for example.

Wish I could point it to my git repositories and have it review the entire projects.I&#x27;ve had mixed experiences with getting it to generate new code. It produced good node.js command line application code. It didn&#x27;t do so well at writing a program that creates 16 bit PCM audio file. I asked it to explain the WAV file format and things like lengths of structures got so confusing I had to research the stuff to figure out the truth. reply airstrike 15 hours agorootparentThis mirrors my experience. Very helpful writing node.js application code, but struggles to walk through simple operations in assembly. My hunch is that the tokenization process really hurts keeping the 1s and 0s straight.It&#x27;s been hit or miss with rust. It&#x27;s super helpful in decrypting compilation errors, decent with \"core rust\" and less helpful with 3rd party libraries like the cursive TUI crateWhich comes as no surprise, really, as there&#x27;s certainly less training data on the cursive crate than, say, expressjsAlso FWIW I have actually pointed it at entire git repos with the WebPilot plugin within ChatGPT and it could explain what the repo did, but getting it to actually incorporate the source files as it wrote new code didn&#x27;t work quite so well (I pointed it to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kean&#x2F;Get and it would frequently fall back to writing native Swift code for HTTP requests instead of using the library) reply Roark66 21 hours agorootparentprev>LLMs are not worthless for programming.They can be worse than worthless.

I&#x27;ve used Gpt4 as a sort of Google on steroids with prompts like \"do subnets in gcloud span azs\" and \", \"in gcloud secret manager can you access secrets across regions\". I very quickly learned to ask \"is it true\" after every answer and to never rely on a given answer too much(verify it quickly, don&#x27;t let misinformation get you too far down the wrong route).

Wow. I found it useful for generating skeletons I then have to fill by hand or tweak. I don&#x27;t think I ever got anything out of Gpt4 that is useful as is (maybe except short snippets 3 lines long).However, I found it extremely useful in parsing emails received from people or writing nice sounding replies. For that it is really good (in English). reply hutzlibu 20 hours agorootparent\"They can be worse than worthless.\"But that is the same, when you blindly follow some stackoverflow answer.And yes, I always have to tweak and I use it only rarely.

Even if they were indeed just procedural generators it would still be impressive. The code has structure and appears useful.But the issue is that you can tell it makes no sense, there is no thought process behind it. It fits in no greater picture.Even if you add more context it still has no purpose.People that find this useful are the same type that copy stackoverflow code that they dont understand. It kinda works when it does but again it doesnt fit in the bigger picture.Code isnt about spelling instructions - an…ai can do that - code is about what goes where in a way that the what changes as often as the where.

But there are some realities you must accept.Number 1. In a team of 20-30 engineers there is only one extremely god \"why is he with us\" engineers who is great at technical stuff and being a people person. However, no matter how nice he is his approach to his job, it is a job and I will only drop hints how the management should be done. He doesn&#x27;t care about where the company is headed because he plays video games, has a family and has a literal life. He doesn&#x27;t care about management and taking on undue responsibilities. Moreover, the people up to has a label for him as an \"engineer\" does not see as a \"manager\".For the rest of the engineers and managers, have also adopted the approach of \"not my problem\", you see a bizarre communication gap. Engineers working closesly with the product don&#x27;t want to talk to their managers, becase the conversation goes like \"if you know this so much, why don&#x27;t you.... \" and managers don&#x27;t want to talk with engineers because \"if you are you so interested, why don&#x27;t you.... \"From this progressive distance between managers and engineers comes the \"manaegment consultant\". Management consultant have the upper management given flexibility of going back and forth between engineers and managers. They can have conversations with full flexibility but they are not bound to \"why don&#x27;t you....\" phrases. They can talk with anyone and submit a report and take home 1 years worth of salary of managers&#x2F;engineers in 1 month.The conversation gap between product and business where management consultants come in. And the funny thing is that, management consultants target those \"I don&#x27;t want to but I should\" work things and report to the upper management. They can do this so well, because they are not burdened with the \"work\" part.Seriously, if you do some introspection, you will see there is plenty of things you know your company should do, but you don&#x27;t want to voice them because it results in more work and in fact more risk. There comes a \"good\" management consultant who will discover those things and report to upper management who will create the system to get those jobs done.That is my pitch if anyone wants a management consultant hire me.

First, he believes that while there may be exceptional engineers who are also good with people, these engineers are generally not interested in managerial responsibilities. Second, he observes a communication gap between engineers and managers, where both parties avoid taking on additional tasks outside their job descriptions. Lastly, he argues that management consultants bridge this gap by identifying issues neither party wants to handle but should. He concludes by saying that he&#x27;d make a good management consultant because he can spot numerous ways a company could improve.If all else fails, the LLM revolution will at least allow us to make sense of ketamine-induced rants on management. reply FrustratedMonky 20 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it was done on Ketamine, but the points are valid.

There will likely be a few meetings in there.But if GPT-4 can make consultants so much better, I imagine it can also do their work for them. And if you combine this with the reduction in communications overhead that comes from not working with an outside group, why wouldn’t clients just accrue all the benefits to themselves, plus the benefit of not paying outside consultants or dealing with the overhead of managing them?This is especially the case when the client is already a domain expert but just needs some additional horsepower. For example, marketing brand managers may work with marketing consultants even though they know their products and marketing very well. They just need more resources, which can come in the form of consultants for reasons such as internal head-count restrictions.Anyway, I just wonder if BCG thought through the implications of participating in this study. To me it feels like a very short step from “helps consultants help their clients” to “helps clients directly and shows consultants aren’t really necessary.”Especially so if the client just hires an intern and gives them GPT-4. reply chaosbolt 22 hours agoparentCompanies like BCG and McKinsey are mostly about liability, as a CEO you call them, pay them the big bucks, have them make up plans and strategies, if it works out you get the credit, if it doesn&#x27;t then well \"we worked tightly with experts from McKinsey, etc. so the blame isn&#x27;t on me\" reply fragmede 22 hours agorootparentThe frustrating one is when you&#x27;ve been telling management something for months (if not years), and the consultant comes in, and their report says what you been saying, and only then does the company finally do what you&#x27;ve been saying all along!

I was tech savvy enough to know that a lot of office work that I do is repeatable and can be done using scripts but not good enough to write those scripts myself. Using Chat gpt allowed me to write those scripts it took me I think 15-20hrs to get the scripts working perfectly. I knew just a little bit of python scripting did not know anything about python pandas or xls writer etc but was able to create something that saves me I would estimate 20-25 hours a week.In my opinion a lot of people here on hackernews as they are themselves good at programing underestimate how services like chat gpt can open a new world to non programmers.

GPT-4 could not do many tasks, so when we say that performance was significantly increased this is only for tasks GPT-4 is well suited to. There is still value here but let&#x27;s put these results into context.> Consultants across the skills distribution benefited significantly from having AI augmentation, with those below the average performance threshold increasing by 43% and those above increasing by 17% compared to their own scoresEven when cherry-picking tasks that GPT-4 is particularly suited for, above average performers only increased performance by 17%. This increase is still impressive, were it to be seen across the board. But I do think that 17% is a lot less than some people are trying to sell. reply denton-scratch 21 hours agoparentHmmm. Perhaps below-average performers are more likely to take GPT output at face-value, being less competent to review and edit it. And above-average performers are more likely to hack the GPT output around, because they&#x27;re confident in their own abilities.Therefore below-average types will produce finished output more quickly; and this was a time-constrained test, so velocity matters.ChatGPT is very good at waffling, and marketing-speak and inspirational messages are essentially waffle. IOW, the tasks were tailor-made for unaided ChatGPT, so high-performers were penalized. reply ellyagg 21 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re underestimating because it compounds.

But he shows no sense of time in his recollections Nick Thorpe in Budapest Mon 18 Sep 2000 21.05 EDT The mystery of the identity of the second world war soldier who returned to his native Hungary five weeks ago after 55 years of captivity in Russia appears to have been solved. Andras Toma - not Andras Tamas, as he was previously thought to be - was reunited with his brother and sister in the small village of Sulyanbokor, eastern Hungary, on Saturday morning. Only DNA tests will prove they are related, but there seems to be little doubt in the minds of the doctors and military officers who have been caring for him since his return. \"Everyone in the room wept, including me,\" said Colonel Laszlo Erdos, head of the defence ministry team which has been researching the PoW's past, as Mr Toma, 75, embraced his brother Janos and sister Anna. \"He looks exactly like our late father,\" his sister said. Mr Toma was then taken to his old school, where he met former classmates. He seemed to recognise places he had not seen for more than 50 years, people at the reunion said. The visit to the village near the Ukrainian border fitted a key piece to a puzzle which began in the summer when Hungary learned of a soldier who had been held for 50 years in a Russian psychiatric hospital and whose identity was uncertain. His return, and the investigation by military and medical experts to establish his identity, has since gripped the country. The latest revelations have come as a blow to the 82 families who had claimed him as their missing relative - about 600,000 Hungarians were taken to the Soviet Union as prisoners during and after the second world war. Andras Veer, director of the Hungarian national psychiatry and neurology institute, said experts managed to track down the relatives from the old man's fragmented memories. Captured \"He told us in which village he worked as a blacksmith's apprentice, where he was born and where he went to school, even the name of his teacher,\" Mr Veer said. That led to a number of tiny villages near the town of Nyiregyhaza, and then to Sulyanbokor, a village of about 40 farmsteads. \"He remembered lots of things, including names, and we also have the documents proving when he disappeared - everything,\" Janos Toma said. Janos was only seven, and Anna one, when Mr Toma, then 19, was captured by the Soviet army in the autumn of 1944. He spent his 20th birthday in a prisoner of war camp east of Leningrad, where Soviet medical records first mentioned him, under the name Andras Tamas, in January 1945. In 1947, as the camp closed, he was transferred to a mental hospital. He had learned only a few Russian words and he barely communicated with the world in the next 53 years. Sulyanbokor, where he grew up and where his brother and sister still live, is about 10 miles west of Nyiregyhaza, the county capital. It is a flat landscape, part of the \"bush-world\" as it is known locally - where the word bokor, meaning bush, is added to every farm name. He is believed to have served an apprenticeship as a blacksmith there before being conscripted into the Hungarian army. He probably took part in the joint German/Hungarian defence of Nyiregyhaza. His father also fought in the war. Sitting in a doctor's room at the institute of psychiatry in Budapest, which has been his home since he returned to Hungary, Mr Toma seemed both lost in his memories and alert to what was going on around him. He spoke all the time, prompted by Col Erdos, who acts as his \"interpreter\". He has no teeth - new ones are being fitted this week - and his pronunciation of often old-fashioned Hungarian, dotted with occasional Russian, is hard to follow. Researchers were led to the \"bush-world\" near Nyiregyhaza by Mr Toma himself. He began to mention the names of places and relatives. As I sat with him, Col Erdos gave him a gift of palinka - Hungarian plum brandy - distilled close to where he was born. Mr Toma sniffed the bottle approvingly. \"Not like that foreign stuff you tried on me the other day,\" he joked - he speaks so much of alcohol his carers offered him a small glass of whisky last week. Amid the flood of his memories it is almost impossible to direct his line of thought. He speaks one moment of a church, then of taking part in the construction of a building, the next moment of the roar of cannon during battle. And, increasing the problems confronting researchers, he refuses to write anything down, and shows no sense of time in his recollections. The church could have been one of the Protestant establishments which dot the landscape of eastern Hungary - most Hungarians are Catholic. His knowledge of certain types of military equipment led researchers to believe he had been in an artillery regiment. When he was presented with a Hungarian private soldier's cap - on loan from the museum of war history in Budapest - he tried it on many times, then said: \"This isn't mine - the insignia is missing.\" But no amount of persuasion could get him to describe the insignia, which would have helped to discover his former regiment. There have been many lighter moments for those who have sat with him for the past weeks. When he was told that he was going to be shown films about the second world war, he moved his chair to the very back of the room - only to be disappointed by his first encounter with television and its tiny images. When he speaks of money, it is about the pre-war Hungarian currency, the pengo. He often mentions a \"five pengo photograph\", perhaps one taken of him in his new uniform before he was taken off to fight. He also frequently mentions scenes connected with his work as a blacksmith, shoeing the cavalry officers' horses. Now that his identity is almost certain, the remaining missing pieces of his past should be easier to find. Janos, a retired farmer, is cautious: \"We're sure he is ours, but we're not saying any more until the tests prove it.\" That could take two weeks. Many of the wartime Hungarian prisoners were civilians, rounded up on the streets by the conquering Russian army and transported east in cattle-trucks to rebuild the Soviet Union. One in three of them died of cold, disease, and malnutrition. The last mass returns took place in 1954. By then Mr Toma was hidden from sight in the mental hospital in Kotelnich, 600 miles east of Moscow, from which he has only now emerged. I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian’s journalism. From Elon Musk to Rupert Murdoch, a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what’s happening in the world. The Guardian is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest – not profit motives. And we avoid the trap that befalls much US media – the tendency, born of a desire to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. While fairness guides everything we do, we know there is a right and a wrong position in the fight against racism and for reproductive justice. When we report on issues like the climate crisis, we’re not afraid to name who is responsible. And as a global news organization, we’re able to provide a fresh, outsider perspective on US politics – one so often missing from the insular American media bubble.

The USSR was no friend to honest inquiry. reply krisoft 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that is historically accurate.He becomes a research interest after he is repatriated in 2000. (For the simple reason that before that he was believed to be just a non-verbal psychiatric patient. There are many of those.)That is well after the dissolution of the USSR and the fall of the Iron Curtain. reply myth_drannon 8 hours agorootparentprevHungary was in the Eastern bloc, so he was considered from a friendly nation ( that is after Hungarian revolution was brutally repressed by the Soviet forces) reply fractallyte 8 hours agorootparent\"...about 600,000 Hungarians were taken to the Soviet Union as prisoners during and after the second world war.\"\"He probably took part in the joint German&#x2F;Hungarian defence of Nyiregyhaza.\"\"Many of the wartime Hungarian prisoners were civilians, rounded up on the streets by the conquering Russian army and transported east in cattle-trucks to rebuild the Soviet Union.

We don&#x27;t hold that against anyone.Your point is good. There&#x27;s no set of rules that works every time.I think the root issue is that the Wikipedia article just wasn&#x27;t the best submission for this story. There were a number of other articles about Mr. Toma&#x27;s story on the web. Picking the best of those would have been a better strategy, and then the title issue would most likely have taken care of itself. reply afterburner 11 hours agoparentprev> When he was told that he was going to be shown films about the second world war, he moved his chair to the very back of the room - only to be disappointed by his first encounter with television and its tiny images.Lol, expecting a movie theatre, guess he was a back-row guy. reply praisewhitey 11 hours agoparentprevSome more information from the reporting at the time>He had never learned Russian, and has lived the last 20 years in linguistic isolation after the last other Hungarian patients left the hospital in 1980.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;2&#x2F;hi&#x2F;europe&#x2F;860033.stm reply Xeoncross 12 hours agoprevHow sad, to fall through the cracks in such a spectacular way.There have been so many appeals for help and obvious missed-test cases posted here by people.

That is, malevolence is not necessary, incompetence is enough. Both are abundant in autocratic, repressive societies, such as the Soviet Union in this case.

The fact that no-one among the entire staff of the hospital over all those decades endeavored even to identify the patient&#x27;s only language tells you that it was not a hospital. reply flashback2199 9 hours agorootparentYeah, even in the US people used to get trapped in psychiatric hospitals. It wasn&#x27;t until the law chipped away at the legal ability to keep patients that changed. reply smeej 8 hours agorootparentprevAnother link someone posted said for the first 30+ years, there were other Hungarian patients he could speak to, so it isn&#x27;t like they didn&#x27;t know. reply masfuerte 12 hours agorootparentprevGood luck getting out of a psychiatric hospital when nobody understands a word you are saying. reply mhh__ 9 hours agorootparentEven if they do there are famous stories about how hard it is to be seen as sane the moment it&#x27;s suspected you&#x27;re not.For example https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosenhan_experiment reply xkcd1963 12 hours agorootparentprevMy objection to your previous message is that you must be assuming he was locked away. If this was the case, why was he let go to Hungary? reply apt-get 12 hours agorootparent> A Czech linguist of Slovak descent, Karol Moravčík, identified him as Hungarian, and on 11 August 2000, Toma arrived back in Hungary where his family was identified through DNA matching.Someone else recognized the language he was speaking, and that it wasn&#x27;t actually gibberish (and so he wasn&#x27;t some crazy old man). reply ahoka 50 minutes agorootparentOh they knew, they just did not care. Eventually someone got the guy on camera and people started to ask questions. reply H8crilA 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are different types of patients in psychiatric hospitals. It depends on the institution but usually the majority of them are not psychotic at all but rather have affective disorders, personality disorders or addictions (or a combination). They can exist in the outside world just fine if there&#x27;s a fitting place for them, think of a cocaine or alcohol addict that even manages to keep up with their high income career. There just wasn&#x27;t a place for him - until he was repatriated.It is really shocking that he never picked up Russian. I understand that Russian and Hungarian are almost as different as Japanese and Hungarian, but he should be able to learn the language just by hearing it. reply smsm42 10 hours agorootparentI think he didn&#x27;t pick Russian because the staff didn&#x27;t bother to talk to him. So he didn&#x27;t have much to hear. reply crooked-v 12 hours agorootparentprevHe was let go to Hungary after fifty-three years, when a Czech visitor coincidentally discovered that he spoke Hungarian. reply ffgjgf1 11 hours agorootparentprevPresumably after the collapse of the USSR Russia stopped using psychiatric hospitals as alternatives to gulags&#x2F;prisons? reply smsm42 10 hours agorootparentNot systematically, but those still were the same institutions, with same staff and management, same warm and welcoming care traditions, etc. So I&#x27;m not sure their approach changed drastically. reply philkrylov 11 hours agorootparentprevRight.

The wikipedia article is a stub. The guardian article quoted (and posted here in the comments) doesn&#x27;t do a good job detailing the exact situation he found himself in. For example what (if any) mental issues he might have had to be kept in the hospital, to what degree he was intelligible when talking (even to someone speaking Hungarian), to what degree he even tried to communicate, in what way he was treated or might have been medicated, etc...Without any of this information the story is a bit of interesting trivia, little more, and provides very little to discuss in my opinion. The quality of comments so far reflect this lack of substance.And just to make sure: None of what I said is meant to belittle his situation from a personal&#x2F;human perspective. reply justinclift 2 hours agoparentAt some point the link has been changed to an article in the Guardian, which has more info: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2000&#x2F;sep&#x2F;19&#x2F;1 reply gumby 6 hours agoprevWhen my mother in law died we cleaned a lot of old stuff out of her house.

He once told me \"Owen is dead\". I had no idea who Owen was but figured it must have been a friend of his.

I have seen a clear pattern: Those who marry someone who speaks their native language rarely learn much English--they can communicate with their spouse and the community is enough for most other needs. Those who marry someone who doesn&#x27;t speak their native language learn at least enough English to reasonably communicate with their spouse. It&#x27;s a much greater driving force.My wife speaks decidedly broken English (to be expected in someone who learned their first word of English at 43 and didn&#x27;t even know our alphabet until adulthood), yet now and then she ends up acting as an interpreter for those with even less English than she has. reply huytersd 7 hours agorootparentSpouse or people that need to provide.

According to article at the time when Hungary was prepping to join EU, ex nazi PoW was not a priority.He only was \"rediscovered\", when Russian hospital personnel got him speaking Hungarian on camera for Russian news, and eventually news segment was picked up in Hungary and 80 Hungarian families came forward to claim him as a missing relative.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ren.tv&#x2F;news&#x2F;lifestyle&#x2F;887400-poslednii-plennyi-vtoro... reply kgeist 10 hours agorootparentThe article also says the Hungarian side later confirmed he did have a mental illness but it&#x27;s RenTV which is not a very trustable source so one should take it with a grain of salt. reply Filligree 9 hours agorootparentAfter fifty years locked up, of course he had a mental illness.

Going to my friends&#x27; houses in the 80s - it was normal for the extended family to all live under one roof - there were a few families with grandparents who did not speak any English at all, and only spoke Czech, Hungarian, or Polish. Of course, the people these non-English speakers did business with on a daily basis for most of their lives in the US were speakers of those languages, and they could also rely on their children - my friends&#x27; parents - to translate. reply Grimburger 9 hours agoparentprevI spent nearly 4 years in a country and barely learnt a thing, everything I knew was from online courses or internet forums.Even then people still respond to me in English and having a conversation was incredibly hard without paying someone for tutoring, I&#x27;d seek out very old shopkeepers to practice some brief interactions but that only gets you so far.Exposure is nowhere near enough to learn. reply smeej 9 hours agorootparentI guess maybe I have more facility than I thought. I only spent a month in France, but could do basic things like order food, give directions, or follow a basic friendly conversation, even if I got by with incorrectly conjugated verbs and hand gestures.In Germany, it was less than two weeks and I could pick up the flow of the sentences even if I still lacked almost all the vocabulary.I assume it would take longer somewhere with a totally different language structure, like if you dropped me off in Japan, never mind another planet, but 50 years?After at most a year, I&#x27;d have to resign myself to, \"I guess I just live here now,\" and get to work. reply Grimburger 7 hours agorootparentI have enough to get by with the basics, but that took concerted effort on my part rather than simply being around it a lot. Nearly everyone would see me as an opportunity to practice English rather than speak in their native tongue, people would switch from one language to the next and not skip a beat to greet me in English.If everyone in Japan spoke English as a second language you might have a harder time than you think at working on it. reply zer0tonin 9 hours agorootparentprev> Even then people still respond to me in EnglishNetherlands? reply acuozzo 5 hours agorootparentprevSweden? reply tkuraku 11 hours agoparentprevYou don&#x27;t just learn a language by osmosis. You need resources, and people to work with you. reply OJFord 10 hours agorootparentIs that how you learnt English (or whatever your first language is) then, not metaphorical osmosis but by sitting down as a small child with lots of resources and people to work with you in deliberate study?It&#x27;s proven to be harder as we age, but it absolutely does work like that. I would assume Toma didn&#x27;t more because of little interaction, not hearing dialogue around him, etc.(And also just because it typically works like that doesn&#x27;t mean he couldn&#x27;t have been unusually predisposed against it, or genuinely ill, or too traumatised&#x2F;uninterested&#x2F;deliberately disengaging.) reply resonious 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d argue that children actually do put in a lot of effort. Parents sit down and teach the kids stuff, and kids are motivated to try and remember things their friends say to them. No empirical evidence though, just a thought. reply wbl 6 hours agorootparentprevParents read picture books to children, play little games to reinforce the associations etc. reply smeej 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not automatic, but I can&#x27;t imagine not trying. Maybe for the first year, you hold out hope of going back, but after that, if people are talking around you, do you not try? If you hear them use the same word for the same thing every time, don&#x27;t you learn it? Don&#x27;t you find ways to ask? reply netsharc 11 hours agoparentprevIt seems like the hospital workers didn&#x27;t really care enough to talk to him&#x2F;to make conversation or even to teach him Russian words like \"bed\", \"toilet\", etc.Even having basic vocabulary, it&#x27;s impossible to have a meaningful conversation... reply smsm42 10 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re thinking about being part of the society, nog being locked up 24&#x2F;7 in a single room, and surrounded by people who care about you as much as the office potted plant. reply 0xDEF 11 hours agoparentprevHe was in a Russian psychiatric hospital.Psychiatric hospitals in many countries are an extension of the prison system. reply toddmorey 11 hours agoparentprevIt seems like sadly he got very little social interaction in the hospital. reply zem 10 hours agoprevspider robinson had a short story, \"the time traveller\", based on the premise that emerging from years of that sort of isolation (i think it was ten years in the case of his protagonist) was tantamount to travelling forward in time. reply mise_en_place 9 hours agoprevI wonder what his inner experience was like those 50 years.

This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website More info Skip to content Photography Insider Info Inspiration Tutorials Reviews How to See Bright, Vivid Images in Your Mind’s Eye by James Somerset A big Thank You for Sharing this page - it really does help us :) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Until I was about 30, I could not see images in my head. When I closed my eyes, all I’d see was black nothingness. Due to random luck, that changed. Before I learned the technique that I’m about to share with you, experimenting with photographic composition was a manual task. I had to physically stand in front of my subject and actually move things. That, or I would fetch a sketchbook & pencils and begin drawing my ideas on paper. Frustratingly, many people at college told me they could see and manipulate bright, clear images in their “Mind’s Eye”. They could preplan their photo-shoots and improve their compositions just by closing their eyes and imagining what the photo might look like. This made absolutely no sense to me. I could not imagine what that would be like. When I closed my eyes, all I could see was a reddy/brown, fuzzy nothingness. Before I Was Taught This Technique If I closed my eyes and tried to visualize, say, an elephant, this is my best shot at showing you what it looked like: Can you see the elephant? No, nor could I. All I could see was the back of my eyelids, with the reddy/brown color coming from what little light passed through them. If I stood in front of a bright light with my eyes closed, I could see that the inside of my eyelids were a lighter brown/red. If I turned away, the inside of my eyelids would become darker. That’s as much as I can tell you about what I could see unless I had my eyes open and was actually looking at something real. What I definitely could not see was any sort of shape, color or image. What Is Aphantasia? I’ve only recently heard the term ‘aphantasia.’ It is a neurological condition in which a person is unable to recall memories as pictures or create images in their imagination. I have no idea whether I would have been diagnosed with aphantasia, or whether what I went on to be taught is a cure. All I know is that I was never able to see images in my mind’s eye. Now, after practicing the technique that I’m about to share with you, I can. It’s also interesting that I was never able to recall dreams. I would tell people that I do not dream. Now, since practicing this technique, I regularly experience and recall strong, vivid dreams. My Trip to London Ten to fifteen years after leaving college I happened to attend an eight day training course in London, England. I didn’t go because I thought I had aphantasia (the term hadn’t even been invented then). The course was part of my regular personal development regimen. Some of the techniques we were taught required us to close our eyes and make the images that we saw grow bigger or smaller, brighter or dimmer, and bring them closer to us or take them further away. I couldn’t do this. It frustrated me. I mentioned to several of the assistant tutors that I couldn’t see images when I closed my eyes. They told me that I was wrong. ~They said that I could see images! When I insisted, I was told that everyone sees pictures in their heads. One of them, trying to be helpful said, with a hypnotic tone in his voice, “Imagine what it would be like … if you could see images in your mind.” After a few minutes, he gave up. I had no comprehension of what it would be like. Several days in to the course one of the Lead Tutors, a man named Michael Neill, asked whether there was anyone in the audience who couldn’t see images in their mind’s eye. Many hands when up—I wasn’t unusual after all! Image Streaming Mr Neill invited a member of the audience to go up to the stage and started to explain and demonstrate a technique he called ‘Image Streaming‘. I couldn’t wait to try it. After a few months of daily practice, this technique affected me in two ways: First, if I was aphantasic, Image Streaming cured it. I could see bright, vivid images in my head. I haven’t practiced the technique in years—but I still see beautifully clear images in my mind’s eye. Second, it improved my photography like nothing else I’d ever done. From that point on I didn’t need to construct a set, find models or leave the house to play with composition or photo ideas. I could just sit back, relax and close my eyes. Image Streaming helped me become a better photographer from the comfort of my armchair. Today I can close my eyes and see detailed images that are pretty close to what I’d see if I had my eyes open and was looking at a TV or cinema screen. I can freeze motion, move props and models, add new items and change the lighting. As someone who couldn’t ever do this before it still amazes me when I close my eyes and create something beautiful. This is something I’ve learned to do—I definitely wasn’t born with it. And, as a bonus, a really useful side effect of Image Streaming is that it can help you fall asleep at night (more about that in the FAQ section below). How to Image Stream It’s easy to learn. Play this video to find out how. One thing, before you do: I have found that many people give up. They try it once or twice and, when nothing happens, they decide it doesn’t work. It took me about a month to get really good results (although I noticed changes earlier.) I would urge you to practice for 10 continuous minutes, at least once a day, for at least a month. It doesn’t work with everyone. If you’re one of the luck ones, you could soon be seeing images in your mind’s eye. FAQ Many people have contacted me about this over the past few years. Here are answers to the most common questions: Q. How long should I rub my eyes for and how hard? Just a few seconds and not at all hard. Most people I’ve spoken to about this have experienced seeing ‘golden dots’ inside their eyelids after rubbing them for a few seconds. It’s something people sometimes do naturally after waking-up in the morning. The objective is to get you started—give you something to begin describing. If you don’t see the golden dots from gently rubbing your eyes, try one of the other 24 backup techniques mentioned in the link at the bottom of this page. You should NOT be rubbing your eyes for more than a few seconds. Q. How long do I have to do Image Streaming for before I’ll see results? Somebody on Reddit (link below) posted results saying that it worked for them within seven to nine days. If you read the comments (below) from readers of this page, you’ll see that some people see an improvement within 20 minutes. Others need a few weeks and, for some, it doesn’t work at all. I can’t promise a cure but I do feel that some people give-up too quickly. My suggestion is that you do it for at least 10 continuous minutes, at least once a day, for at least a month before deciding that it doesn’t work for you. Q. Can I do Image Streaming without speaking the words out-loud? Not if you want to be able to improve your ability to see images in your mind’s eye! As described further down this page, speaking inside your head while doing Image Streaming is likely to send you to sleep. Q. All I see is black. How can I describe what I see when there’s nothing to see? If you can’t see the ‘golden dots’ after rubbing your eyes gently for a couple of seconds, try some of the 24 backup techniques mentioned in the Further Reading section at the bottom of this article. Q. If I use a voice recorder, do I have to listen back to what I’ve said? No. I’m not going to pretend that I understand why but it seems that your mind just needs to know what the words are being recorded. You can, of course, listen to the recordings if you want to. Personally, I didn’t bother. Q. By the time I’ve begun describing something, it’s gone and something else is there instead. Yep, that’s exactly what happened to me at first. For me, there came a time when I could concentrate on the things I was seeing and I could make them stay. Until then, just keep up as best you can. The Early Days The sound clip that I’ve included within that video is from a very early Image Streaming session. I have become much better with practice. Images now come easily, clearly and quickly. For me, at least, it really has been worth the effort of dedicating time every day to practicing streaming images in my mind. (I don’t know whether it’s improved my IQ though.) Do You Have Trouble Getting to Sleep? There’s a super useful bonus reason to learn how to image stream. Not only can it improve your photography and potentially improve your intelligence it can help you fall sleep more easily! To quickly and easily fall asleep, perform the technique in the way described in the video with one exception—rather than speaking the detailed descriptions of what you see out loud—say the words inside your head while you lie in your bed. There’s no need for a voice recorder or friend! Doing image streaming in this way will send you to sleep quickly. Can Image Streaming Cure Aphantasia? If I had known that there is a ‘condition’ called aphantasia while I was college I would have asked to be tested for it. Its description seems to fit my experience. However, the fact that I do now have a functioning mind’s eye means that either Image Streaming cured my aphantasia or I was never truly aphantasic. All I know is that I was never conscious of being able to see images in my mind’s eye until I practiced Image Streaming. Related or not, I was never conscious of dreaming when I was asleep either. I am now. I’d love for this article to reach some true aphantasics and for them to practice the technique to see if it offers them any solutions. The great thing is that you don’t need to be able to see images to practice Image Streaming! Further Reading Michael Neill cited Win Wenger, PhD as the inventor of Image Streaming. Here are links to the Image Streaming section of his website and to the 24 back-up techniques that he lists which can help those people who can’t see the ‘golden dots’ when rubbing their eyes. I’ve also included some other links that you may find interesting.

Reply Lisa Monday, February 13, 2023 at 4:33 pm Hello Has anyone been successful at being hypnotized with aphantasia? That is what led me to research “not being able to visualize” years ago. I found one obscure article about aphantasia, but glad to see so many resources now. Still looking for a technique that will work for me. Thanks for sharing this. Reply Justin Saturday, December 24, 2022 at 3:32 am Hello Mr. Somerset, Have you ever tried lucid dreaming? It’s a passion of mine. I tried your visualization technique and it worked quite well for me. I noticed too that as my visualization ability improves my ability to recall dreams seems to improve in a proportional way. Thank you for posting such an interesting subject. Based upon my own experimentation with lucid dreaming, the higher the no. of dreams that one can recall, the greater the odds are that one will experience a lucid dream. I’m presently working on a technique that utilizes visualization for help with falling asleep as in your blog but it’s involved in a rather tricky way with a lucid dreaming technique called WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dream). It’s tricky because one must fall back asleep at a time that’s late enough in the morning for one’s REM cycles to be at their longest which also happens to be close to the time when one is waking up for the day ahead. One must try to fall back asleep after having been awake for an hour after having slept for 6 or 7 hours. I’m not sure if any of this will even make sense but if it does, I’d like to further explain my technique to you and see if you have anymore useful suggestions. Thanks Again, Justin Reply e Thursday, January 27, 2022 at 4:13 am Hey, I can’t picture images when my eyes are closed but when they’re open, I can’t see images perfectly but it’s there. It’s kinda like daydreaming, so is this a part of aphantasia? Reply MYO Tuesday, January 18, 2022 at 11:12 am Hello James, I am a french aphant, so please excuse my english Your article is a light of hope in my life. To think that being possible of seeing images in my mind one day is amazing. I have a few questions for you. Do you think your new capacity make your life better? Is it incredible to see vivid images after years of blindness? Do this hard training worth it afterall? I started the exercices a week ago. I rub my eyes for a couple of seconds, then I see the phosphenes. But when I try to describe them, they vanished very quicly, and I can’t make them last. What can I do the raise the duration? Thanks for your time. You’re such a great person. Reply MYO Saturday, January 15, 2022 at 9:55 pm Hello James, I am a french aphantasic, so please apologize my english Your article makes the effect of a bomb in my mind. In a good way obviously. It makes me realize that we were more than I thought, and that together, we could share and make changes. I discovered my aphantasia almost 2 monts ago, and it was weird to think that, everything I thought as normal to me, well… actually I was the exception among people. Knowing that the majority could effectively create images in their mind… depressed me a little, to be honest. But you created this article. And now I am here, writting down this message. So thank you. I have a few questions about the Image Streaming and one about you. When I rub my eyes gently, the phosphenes starting to appear. This parts is ok, I have the phosphenes, yeepee!! But then, when I stop rubbing, the sparkles vanish, and I can’t maintain their presence. Do I have to decribe them even if they are vanished? Do you have any tip? And the question about you is, do you have memories now? And do you have access to the old memories before your training with Image Streaming? Thank you for your time. MYO Reply Aqil Muga Monday, January 3, 2022 at 7:58 pm dude, so when i am practicing? I just describe what i see? THATS IT? everyday till i see results? Reply James Somerset Monday, January 3, 2022 at 8:21 pm Hi. Thanks for the question. Basically, yes. As per the video, you need to describe what you see to a friend or into a voice recorder. You need to use as much detail as possible. But, yes, just describe what you see and the images you see in your head may become more bright, clear, colorful, and in focus. Reply Ian Monday, July 31, 2023 at 7:00 pm Do you see the images directly on the back of your eyelids or in your minds eye? Reply Thomas Gourgnier Tuesday, December 7, 2021 at 11:46 am Hello James, I’am really happy to have been driven to your post. And I thanks you a lot for your share. 45 years old, I realised 3 months ago that people were really seeing thing when talking about visualization. The first purpose that really matter for me is to be able to remember the faces of my sons. So I am particing for a week now and had some little success. I had a vision of sharp clouds while trying in front of the sun (be carefull) and one time before sleeping (without doing the exercise but just tryning to see) a 5 branches star then a 6 branches star drawned like with a sharpe pen. I will carry on. I am motivated. Most of the time I see like wide spots of pale colors moving around. Sorry for my English, not practissing for years. Thanks again. Reply Neo Tuesday, October 26, 2021 at 7:14 pm Hey, whenever I’m in a lighted room I sometime barely see blurred splotches of white. They feel like an after-image, they’re usually in a shape of something I already been looking at, but they never change. Do I need to focus on those things, or my focus needs to be focused more internally? I’m not really sure how to do it, since when other people say they visualize, they emphasized that it’s not like seeing after-images. I’ve been trying for some months (inconsistently), but haven’t had any luck. Reply lena Tuesday, October 12, 2021 at 5:32 pm WHAT THE ….!!! This can’t be true! i did this technique until i was like 12 – every day, looking at colors and all, pressing my eyes! and my mother told me to stop, and i got aphantasia! / or, i had it before and cured it with the technique as a child. Now i can’t see anything. Will start again! Thank you so much! By the way: I’m a photographer and photographed for ‘the new yorker’ <3 <3 – photography and aphantasia is very connected for me. Will do more work on this topic in the future. Reply Suri Saturday, September 4, 2021 at 2:41 am When i tried rubbing my eyes and describing the dots i saw, i couldn’t, to be honest i just saw one circle and that was it. Reply Justin green Thursday, June 10, 2021 at 6:07 pm I’ve tried the exercises mentioned above for bout a week and no progress whatsoever I don’t know if I’m doing it wrong or what but every time I try the exercise I still see nothing just the back of my eyelids and nothing else so I think I need extra help but I’m flat broke so I can’t pay money for progress because I don’t have any money.so for any ideas? Reply Justin green Monday, June 7, 2021 at 5:42 pm Nothing I do seems to work Reply Justin green Monday, June 7, 2021 at 5:35 pm I’m able see Clearly images in my dreams but I can’t control what I see and when I’m awake and I close my eyes I see either pitch black or brown with white dots every other spot the only time I see images is by after images or if I am playing a video game for more than a few hours the movements and whatnot gets stuck there for bout maybe a couple hours then I see nothing also I have a roommate and I’d prefer to try verbally describe what I see in secret or private but I can’t because I have a roommate Reply Masha Wednesday, May 19, 2021 at 5:13 pm It works! I’ve been doing it for two weeks, and I can see things now. It’s still mostly black and white and I can’t always control it, but I’m getting better at it. Now I can close my eyes and see the beach (and my dreams got way more vivid too) Thank you!!! Reply Niv Thursday, June 24, 2021 at 9:24 am Hey, can I ask what you did exactly for it to work? What I have been doing for some weeks are looking on images, describing them as after-images appear and then when it’s going doing the same all over again. But I barely describe because I barely see. Do you describe also if you don’t really see it but get the impression of it? Because I’m trying to describe only what I see even though I get an impression. I’d be happy if you reply, but I’ll be thankful if you return to this page and see my reply. Reply Neo Tuesday, October 26, 2021 at 7:10 pm Hey, can you share the progress you went through? I tried to do it, but I haven’t succeed. Did you just practice with after-images? I’m not sure if I’m doing this right. When I’m near a lighted room I can sometime see splotches of white stuff, is this where I need to put my attention to? Or I’m supposed to feel it more internally? Reply Leon Jd Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 3:29 pm Hey, i have been doing IS now for some weeks but i can’t notice any progress. I imagine myself in a place and start describing as fast as i can. But the problem is i can’t see anything. It’s just concept. It is really hard to describe it, all i see is black but i have like the idea of what it looks like but i think this is the wrong way to start IS. So how did you do it? Did you really just describe the colour dots you got from rubbing your eyes and stuff like this? Do you have any tips and how long did it take to see results? Best regards Reply James Somerset Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 3:39 pm Yes, I really did do it the way I describe in the article! If you are describing concepts, you are not describing what you’re SEEING. You need to describe what you are SEEING. So – gently – rub your eyes for a few seconds, stop and describe the patterns you see. Describe any shades of black you see – it isn’t all black when you close your eyes: if there’s a window to your left, the left side of your eyelids will be a kinda reddy-brown color. If, just before you closed your eyes, you had looked at a window or a light buld or a candle, you will see an after image for a few seconds. Whether you’re describing after images or the dancing dots, there will be patterns. They will be hard to describe at first but, if you have vision (ie if your eyes can pick out the shades of light passing through your eyelids) there are patterns and shapes. Reply Leon Jd Friday, February 9, 2018 at 3:32 pm Thank you for your reply! So today i started with the eye rubbing technique and i am also looking at different shapes on my laptop and afterwards i am describing the after image. So i look at it, close my eyes, describe the different colors, shapes, dots and when i can not see anything anymore i repeat it. Does this sound right? And how am i supposed to add other senses like smell, touch and stuff like that? Best regards Reply James Somerset Friday, February 9, 2018 at 4:19 pm What you describe you are doing is EXACTLY how I did it Good luck! Please let us know how it goes. As for other senses, I don’t know. I’ve never tried. I’m afraid I’ll have to leave you to research those. Reply Leon Jd Saturday, February 10, 2018 at 12:58 pm I will! Yes, I am using my iphone recorder! Should be enough hopefully! Matthew Wednesday, January 24, 2018 at 10:42 pm I’ve been trying to get started with image streaming, but whatever visual perceptions I get (flashing lights, fuzzy circles, whatever) often change completely more than once per second — WAY too fast to describe them. I’ll keep trying, but so far I can’t seem to get past that issue. Reply James Somerset Saturday, January 27, 2018 at 9:18 am @disqus_jDz7LsVGFd:disqus Yes, I’ve experienced this. All I did was begin describing the most prominent image and continue to describe it even when it had gone. When it seemed appropriate I began describing the next prominent image. There came a point where images would stay around for longer. Also, I became able to control the images – adding new things, moving things, changing color and viewpoint. I hope that helps. Reply Tomasz Karaban Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:22 pm Hi, its really really weird about effects of image streaming. I am doing image streaming becouse of iq. And ! My memory never was like yesterday and today little too, so poor and bad. Unbelievable i clearly see results but reverse. When i am doing it i see little colored patterns which durning session is gaining more and more colors, stronger patterns, and as i see its going in right direction. As i see its really going to be stronger and sharper and i believe it will transform into so powerful images. But why my mind works as bad as never. Its maybe something like tired mind, and i hope this low border of mind power will be higher and higher. Its 10 days from start. And my imagination maybe is better i Don’t know becouse imagination sometimes is stronger and weaker depends of day. I will report later too. I am curious where its going and i hope my nonprogressive mind (5months visualisation) finally broke this border. Best regards Tomasz. Reply Jon Friday, November 24, 2017 at 12:23 am I discovered I have “aphantasia” seven years ago, and it was devastating. I visualize while asleep, or in a hynagogic state, so I know the capacity exists in me. I am convinced that if there is a way to overcome aphantasia, it is through exercises like this. I have tried it before, but never continued for as long as I should have. How long should this typically take? I have noticed a general defeatism among those with the condition. Reply Tomasz Karaban Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 11:51 pm Continue for more than just few days, after maybe 2 weeks or earlier you will see progress, but as i think this depends of person. Someone will see progress after 6 days and somone after one month. If you have aphantasia as i think it could take more time. Just practise you will see and back here again and say what you get, dont forget. Bye Reply Jon Monday, November 27, 2017 at 12:12 am Ok. What progress did you see, and how long did it take? Just curious, thanks. Reply Tomasz Karaban Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:54 am My progress is really weird, i am practising looking at my mind (darkness) 25 days but i didnt describing. I started doing this with describing 10 days now, and! My progress is like reverse, yesterday i realised my mind worked horrible, dramatical memory, zero focus. Today is better but still not good. I believe this is something like tired mind and effect of this technique and now will be better and better. And no idea about imagination progress becouse visualisation working different through days and i can say only after bigger progress. Anyway my imagination works nice through this days. I am looking at this darkness when i close my eyes. I see colors, patterns which durning the session change to stronger fiolet and green patterns and sometimes this is stronger and i see storm of this colors, but i didnt reach realistic pictures yet. And sometimes my pictures are really intresting, this color storm have been transforming into more realistic views, but i saw it just once, i hope this will be stronger, better and more realistic with time. Reply Tom W Saturday, November 18, 2017 at 5:29 pm Thank you for this brilliant article and video. I came across this page by Googling “aphantasia cure”. I’ve been on this page for 20 minutes and have already made very small, but also very interesting, progress! I see nothing but do see a light when I close my eyes after looking at a light and then the light disappears after a few seconds. For 10 minutes I’ve been looking at the light, then closing my eyes and describing what I see. The light blob has a few times turned into very small and vague patterns and a few times into objects for a few seconds, such as a smiling face (almost like the Nivana smile), a hand and a strange tunnel pattern. Both not very detailed at all but to me, after a life of nothing, is very strange indeed. The smiling face appeared after I described the blob as happy. I have no idea why I chose that word – but then the smile appeared. It’s freaking me out I want to continue properly with the technique you mentioned. I’ll report back with how it goes. Reply James Somerset Saturday, November 18, 2017 at 10:44 pm Hey Tom – it sounds like you’re making great progress. I know what you mean about it feeling strange. And I also recognize how the choice of words you use seems to affect the pictures you see. Please let me (us) know how it goes Reply Tomasz Karaban Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 4:46 pm HI James, I practised simple visualisation for 5 months daily- – zero results, so now i am practising backup procedure of IS – worth describing – every day 13 days now. When i am closing my eyes i see fiolet storm and green patterns or fiolet bloobs of color or fiolet patterns its weird and hard to describe. IS that the same what you get with time ? Would you describe in steps what you saw ? Thanks for all, i will leave a coment after more time BEST regards Reply James Somerset Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 8:31 pm YES! Keep practicing. It sounds to me as if you’re making progress. Remember that you MUST describe what you are seeing. Learn to find the words. Describe the patterns and colors. Try to make your friend (or voice recorder) understand what is that you can see. The better you analyze and describe what you are ‘seeing’, the faster your progress. What I saw was vague patterns that kinda resembled things but they quickly changed or disappeared completely. Sometimes there would be colors, sometimes not. Sometimes all I’d see is clouds of color (like you). Sometimes it would be just shapes. Eventually the images became stronger such that they took precedence over the insides of my eyelids. That was the point at which I felt I had truly learned to visualize. I look forward to hearing how you get on Reply Tomasz Karaban Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 11:09 pm I’ll report you about my progress for sure its so so so important for me. Reply Matthew Wednesday, November 1, 2017 at 5:09 pm Can you use this to accurately recall past events, faces of friends or family members, etc.? Basically has it given you a “visual memory,” or only the ability to imagine more creatively? Reply James Somerset Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 8:24 pm So, first I should say I have a TERRIBLE memory. I also have a TERRIFIC memory! Past events: no, Image Streaming doesn’t seem to have helped that at all. My memory for past events has always been pretty pathetic. I can remember some things – events that stand out – but most of my past is ‘dark’. If you asked about something that happened yesterday: what he said, what she said, what they were wearing – I’d make a poor witness. I can recall general concepts and feelings but not visual detail. I can visualize friends’ faces – that’s new since Image Streaming. But … where Image Streaming has really helped is in using mnemonic techniques (using mental images to link items together in the ways taught by Harry Lorayne and Tony Buzan). With an hour or two of practice I could recite Pi to hundreds of decimal places. I can quote entire pages from my favorite books. I can remember a phone number reliably and easily (weeks later) after hearing it said just once. Mnemonics is all about using mental pictures to encode the information you want to learn. I’ve been trying to do it since I was a teenager. Only after Image Streaming did I make any real progress. Reply Matthew Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:26 pm Thanks for the detailed reply! The one thing that bothers me about my aphantasia (which I have no doubt I have) is that I absolutely cannot recall the faces of my loved ones. If my wife, mother, kids, etc., were to die, all I’d have left of them is their photographs, and not anything approaching a visual reminder of the “little” things about their personalities that snapshots don’t (usually) capture. I would dearly love to be able to store away pictures in my mind for that purpose. Mnemonics is something I’ve also struggled with since grade school. Everyone used to say how easy it was to memorize things that way, but to me, all it did was give me MORE things to remember! Looks like Image Streaming could be well worth the time and effort. I’ll give it a shot! Reply Rafaela Mello Tuesday, October 24, 2017 at 5:27 am Thank you so much for sharing this. I’m an illustrator and I’ve been struggling all my life because I can’t see things clearly in my mind, so I draw and I draw and I draw and can’t really seem to memorize anything. So I read about this aphantasia thing and suddenly everything made sense. And because of this I was completely unmotivated and felt like giving up on art, which is the most important thing in my life, but this article gave me hope. I’m definitely gonna try this technique and return here to tell you how it went. Reply 5o5o Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 1:57 am Hey, I just stumbled upon this article today but I’ve already forgotten how. Anyway, I’m going to start practicing this tonight, June 30th 2017. I’ll check back in a few months from now and let everyone know of my progress. I’m completely aphantastic (No sound, images, feelings, nothing) so if this does work for me, it has to work for everyone else. It just has to.. And even if it doesn’t- have hope guys, this condition does not define us. It does not mean the end for us or our humanity in the slightest. Good luck to you all! Reply James Somerset Sunday, September 24, 2017 at 3:04 pm So how’s Image Streaming going for you? Any progress? Reply 5o5o Tuesday, September 26, 2017 at 6:23 pm Ha I said all that but completely gave up like 3 days in.. I’m back here because I was thinking of starting it up again but I have my own theory. I’m going to try to lucid dream first for some reason it feels right, then once I get the hang of that I’m going to work on my waking state visualization. Reply Delilah M. Rainey Saturday, February 10, 2018 at 12:36 pm how did the lucid dreaming go? Reply RI Editor Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:40 pm Thanks for the video, James! I’m eager to try this later today. I wonder if you can help me out, here: I’ve been able to imagine scenes in novels and can conjure up an image (though I hesitate to call it that, because it seems almost transparent or hollow) at will, but I have a hard time doing this with my eyes closed. When they are closed, I’m distracted by the image of my eyelids, and the mental image seems less real. So, when you “see” an image during visualization, does it cover the image of your eyelids? Or can you still literally see your eyelids? I know this is not super clearly written, but this sort of thing is tough to capture. Maybe the best way to describe it is that when I try to visualize, the imagery happens “higher up” than my eyes? Reply James Somerset Sunday, September 24, 2017 at 3:03 pm Hey! I am so sorry that I haven’t replied already – I must have missed the the email that told me you’d commented. So – to answer your question – yes, you can still see the inside of your eyelids. However, as the images grow stronger, you soon learn to ignore your eyelids. It’s a bit like the fact that you can see the world around you through from the corners of your eyes (peripheral vision) but when you’re focused on something in front of you, you don’t notice the sides. Or how if you focus on a friend in a crowd, the others around you become unimportant. Reply Celia Justo Wednesday, May 17, 2017 at 5:43 pm Hi James, it’s day two of trying the image streaming you describe. I’m having trouble keeping up with the rapid pace. I feel as though I have long periods of nothing in between light images. At first, I was thinking of things and then trying to imagine them. But after reading up on image streaming again it seems like you are supposed to describe what’s happening instead on thinking about something and Then describing it. Is this correct? Any advice on how to increase the flow so I’m moving at a faster pace? Also, are you supposed to listen back on your recordings after your done with the excersise? Thanks for sharing this! Reply James Somerset Friday, May 26, 2017 at 8:53 pm Hi @cmj123:disqus. I think it’s pretty normal (in the early days of image streaming) to have these long gaps of nothingness (at least, that was my experience). Stick with it. Until I made this video, I have never made any serious attempt at listening back to my recordings. I’m pretty sure you don’t need to – your brain just needs to know what ‘someone’ is taking notice while you are actually doing the talking. Hope that helps Reply Angie Monday, March 27, 2017 at 8:10 pm Wow, I spent all last night googling information on this and really appreciate your article. So now, through this technique, can you visualize all the time..or just when focusing on an object or doing the image streaming? I’ve been doing a lot of guided meditation lately through yoga and other workshops, and this is when I realized I may have this issue of aphantasia. I close my eyes and find myself so frustrated that I can’t do a simple visualization that my teachers are asking for. The most frustrating thing is I’m a very visual learner, so I really would love to include visualization in my meditation to take things a bit deeper. But I just can’t. Just black! I tried this last night by rubbing my eyes and looking for specks, but they went away so fast all I could say was, ” black circle with a green rim around it”. That was literally it. Any suggestions for working on this? Reply James Somerset Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 1:12 pm Hi Angie – the specks do go away quickly (within seconds). What they do is give you something to focus on. You begin describing what you can see. You’ll notice patterns/shapes within the specks. Talk out loud about them. By concentrating on the patterns, they will hang around for longer. At this stage what you’re seeing is not the specks but very faint images created by your brain. It’s those images that you want to train your brain to see. As you train, you’ll be able to pull brighter, bigger, more detailed images from that part of your brain. Reply Rachel Howe Saturday, March 18, 2017 at 12:42 pm Learned I was an aphant (before there was a name for it) about 10 years ago, when I was in my mid 30’s. I had been working an extremely long shift that had been mentally and physically grueling… I was exhausted. Suddenly, like someone flipped a switch, my mind shifted from aphant style thinking, to purely visual thinking. Because it was so surreal and shocking, the best way I can describe it in words, is “lucid dreaming.” It was so easy to process “thinking” this way and I didn’t want it to stop. I could, not only see pictures in my mind, but could control them. I was dumbfounded. And even more so as I learned that everyone else I asked, could do this on command, ALL THE TIME! In fact, if I asked them to think about something WITHOUT using mental imagery, they could not. Sadly, when I woke the next morning, it was gone, I could not bring it back. Over time, I had noticed that just before falling asleep, occasionally I can have mental images, but I cannot control them, I can only “watch” them. If I have trouble falling asleep, I will often try to visualize a simple object like an orange. Typically, I cannot even conjure the color orange, let alone the texture or shadows of an orange. But it does tend to “knock” me right out. My guess is that the effort required to focus, quiets everything else in the mind. I’m looking forward to trying this out. If I could add just a small bit of mental visualization into my waking self, I can see many uses. Thank you for sharing this approach. Reply James Somerset Saturday, March 18, 2017 at 1:31 pm Wow! That’s a totally new take on it for me. Thanks for taking the trouble to write all of that James Reply sanitychecker Monday, February 13, 2017 at 1:08 am I am 59 years old, and up until one hour ago I had never heard of the word aphantasia. Earlier this evening, I was talking with my wife about how poorly I visualize (I can actually visualize tiny bits and piece of images, usually without color, but that’s it). Within the past hour I learned that there are people who can visualize nothing at all … which oddly enough makes me feel a little better about my condition. I’m very good at imagining sounds. Under certain circumstances, I can hear entire orchestras or bands, sometimes being able to differentiate individual instruments in my mind’s eye. I’m pretty good at imagining touch, too. So I appreciate you taking the time to explain how you do image streaming, because I have long wished that I could have that skill as well. I had already found the Win Wenger article, and I’ve printed it out with the intention of asking my wife to work with me on it. I also found a website at http://aphant.asia/ that has a forum full of people who experience aphantasia. I was alarmed to discover that there are a lot of people with the condition who are frightened or otherwise unwilling to even want to visualize effectively, while there are others who (like me) feel sad that they lack the ability. But I refused to be put off by their negativity. Within minutes, I found Wenger and your article. That’s my long-winded way of saying “thank you” for writing it. Reply Lee Kian Thursday, February 9, 2017 at 10:07 am I am confused, after I close my eye, I see 2 type of image, one is just dark, which is what i see behind my eye lid; another one is the image in my mind (not in front of my closed eye), which is some movies/images that i have just watched. Which image should i observe? Thank you Reply James Somerset Monday, February 13, 2017 at 8:52 am Hi Lee – thanks for your question. You concentrate on the images in your mind; ignore the back of your eye lids. Reply Berthold Lorenz Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 4:55 pm hey thanks for writing this up. in a sea of “we dunno/can’t be helped/you are special be happy” i read after finding out that most people mean picturing things literally, your experience gives me hope i may be able to learn…… someday. i have been trying for about 2 months now, every evening before i go to sleep, sometimes in the morning/day. the only way i have been able to start seeing anything is with after images/phosphenes. i tried a lot of variations with how i describe them, how much i allow myself to imagine without pictures, etc, etc. so far i can’t get further than the after images/phosphenes themself. they either fade away to nothingness, or in case of phosphenes if i can still keep focus on seeing them while describing, they just keep on rapidly changing into mostly indescribable shapes. now for the good parts. in the 2nd week, when observing phosphenes i think i may actually have imagined a weird V shape. it looked like a phosphene, but it stayed observable for what felt like about 10 seconds. every other phosphene i see either flashes really quickly, a split second, or is continuously morphing into other shapes. this V was static, it was big enough that i was able to look at each corner separately and when i realized that, my heart rate jumped like crazy and i lost focus. after that for about another week i was barely able to even observe phosphenes. i think i tried to hard, with renewed enthusiasm that i may be able to learn after all. couple more weeks rolled by and i told myself more and more it may just have been another phosphene, just a for me rare static one. now a couple days ago, i believe the same thing happened again. but this time it was small enough that i could see everything at once. i had enough time to describe the outline with “maybe 2 fingers, index and middle finger like from a hand resting flat on a table” after which either the shape changed or i realized i’m seeing more detail, the outline for fingernails and a thumb. while describing those my heart rate rocketed again, and again i’m having a hard time to just observe the phosphenes since. so i’m really not sure if i actually imagined something those 2 times because they still looked like phosphenes, shapes made from contrast or outlines. but it definitely was something different than all other times. i tried it with after images as well, but those only ever fade away and never sparked something new. i will continue to try, even if i may never be able to actually picture things, i believe my ability to recall dreams and my normal “blind” way of imagining things is getting better. Reply James Somerset Monday, February 13, 2017 at 9:01 am Hey Berthold, this is really positive. Thanks for taking the time to give such a detailed description of your experience. The “weird V shape [that] stayed observable” and looked more-or-less like phosphenes is very much like my early Image Streaming sessions. It sounds to me as if you’re making good progress. Keep at it! In my experience, it works. (Can I just check that when you Image Stream before bed, you are doing so out loud using your real voice rather than the voice inside your head?) Reply Gilles (جيل شحادة) Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:07 pm Do you keep rubbing your eyes for the entire 10 minutes ? Reply James Somerset Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 11:53 pm Hi @disqus_M8g5WhIGT7:disqus — my apologies for taking so long to reply (I’ve been away on a shoot in the South of England). No, you don’t keep rubbing your eyes the entire time. You rub them only for a few seconds at the start. As soon as you see the bright dots of light, you stop rubbing and start describing what you see. What you may find is that once you are aware of the dots you begin to see other shapes and patterns forming. These will probably be vapid and indistinct at first. Just keep practicing. If you find that you don’t see any patterns or shapes after rubbing your eyes, try one of the other ‘back-up’ techniques (see the link at the end of the article). By-the-way: I had saw an absolutely stunning image last night as I was in bed trying to fall asleep. One of the best I’ve ever seen. Detailed, complex and stunning — and I haven’t image streamed in years (so it shows that the technique can have long-lasting effects). Please let me know how you get on. With kind regards, James. Reply Agent M Sunday, May 1, 2016 at 4:59 pm I hope this works, though I cannot help but feel pessimistic. Image streaming has been used as a dubious method to increase intelligence, but maybe this is a more useful application. I also cannot literally think in words, because I cannot imagine sounds: I literally have to express in sound or writing to even think, which causes trouble in situations where I have to be quiet. Reply James Somerset Sunday, May 1, 2016 at 8:03 pm Hi M! Thank you for taking the time to comment. Please let me know how you get on. The results I’ve had with Image Streaming have been so good that I’m keen to share it with others. So far my experience is limited to myself. I’d love to know whether (or not) it works for other people. Reply James Somerset Sunday, June 5, 2016 at 5:53 pm Hey @singinglark:disqus , have you any news?

Like, the brown-blackness of the back of your eyelids gets replaced with something you actually see, like it&#x27;s projected there?I can imagine what something looks like, and I guess I sort of &#x27;see&#x27; it, but closing my eyes doesn&#x27;t make it any more real. It doesn&#x27;t seem to involve the eyes or any part of the visual system at all - it&#x27;s somewhere else in my head. reply Al-Khwarizmi 1 minute agoparentI&#x27;m like you. It&#x27;s called aphantasia. But to this day, I still wonder if we are really different from most people or it&#x27;s just that most people are more lenient in using words like \"seeing\", \"mind&#x27;s eye\", etc. in a metaphorical sense.There seems to be no external measurable manifestation or consequence (contrary to what some people might think, I can answer questions about hypothetical spatial rotations, etc. just fine. I don&#x27;t visualize and rotate the object, but I sort of imagine the \"concept\" of the object and can rotate such \"concept\". It&#x27;s just that the process for me doesn&#x27;t involve \"seeing\" anything). So it&#x27;s hard to know to what extent the difference is real. reply Jiocus 12 hours agoparentprevIf I remember correctly, aphantasia is inability to visualise images, objects or memories in the mind, and this seems to be what the author actually refers to. The alternative, to actually perceive imagery with the eye that isn&#x27;t there is usually called hallucination. The article doesn&#x27;t get at this difference and seems to be based on Youtube videos about aphantasia.If you&#x27;ve ever had a dream with vivid first person eyesight (like most people during dreams) then it&#x27;s easy to see that we should be very capable of producing high quality visuals without external stimuli.I&#x27;ve been practicing on this kind of thing as it&#x27;s a technique for dropping into a lucid dream. In my case, I manage to find some kind of repeat pattern in the visual random noise of my closed eyes. Slowly and consciously I manage to see clouds or waves on an open sea, maybe add color. Then I can try something more advanced. If going to sleep, these images get more vivid and might classify for something called hypnagogic hallucinations[0], but then it&#x27;s not quite the same level of conscious involvement steering what to see. In any case, it&#x27;s nowhere near what I&#x27;d imagine as useful for an on-site photo session, more like a high effort meditation.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypnagogia reply godelski 10 hours agorootparentSpeaking of dreams, similar to the author&#x27;s comment about needing to try a month before getting good results, I used to not remember my dreams at all. I decided to keep a dream journal. First week I only had like 3 entries with one sentence notes like \"saw the color blue.\" But a few months in I was remembering most of my rem cycles, 6 months in and the dreams could continue through cycles (like one long epoch). I did this for 2 years -- stopped because I had a few times where I had just long dreams where I just did normal things (stressed at those times over the monotony of my life) and they just seemed like extra work days -- and a decade later and I still remember most of my dreams. I only ended up lucid dreaming (the goal) a few times though. But mostly because I was enjoying my dreams so much that I had little desire to take control when in them. reply Jiocus 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve tried journaling my dreams but I found it to be tedious due to the amount of dreams and their various contents. Some dreams consist of strong emotions and what I sense as I wake up is not the dream, but the feeling of have been separated from the dream. That&#x27;s hard to put into words in the middle of the night. In the end, I tend to recall my dreams quite well, many of which have a permanent place among other episodic real life events.I have a few dreams that are like a long running TV show, suddenly I&#x27;m in this certain universe and the plot continues, even though it&#x27;s been a few years. In a single sleeping session it&#x27;s often the rule that dreams continue even if I wake up in the middle. It&#x27;s so consistent that waking up from a nice dream doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s lost but gives me something to look forward to.Lucid dreaming in my experience is very much an Inception-like (the film) experience. Once you have \"woken\", there&#x27;s a fine line between controlling the dream, and the dream noticing what you&#x27;re up to, eventually booting you from the matrix.For something more on topic and for anyone that will be experiencing a lucid dream in the future: Take a moment to really appreciate the extreme level of graphics, and other senses the mind can render. reply godelski 3 hours agorootparent> That&#x27;s hard to put into words in the middle of the night. In the end, I tend to recall my dreams quite well, many of which have a permanent place among other episodic real life events.Yeah I found that when I start losing the ability to recall that if I just try to remember. That&#x27;s the point of the journal anyways. But yeah, it is crazy the dreams I had and how real they were. Entire lives. And even the lessons you learn from choices you make. The emotions and how things even feel real to the though.> and the dream noticing what you&#x27;re up to, eventually booting you from the matrix.This kept happening to me! The first time I did it started to fly but then just kept going up and up and it got brighter and I woke up haha.> Take a moment to really appreciate the extreme level of graphics, and other senses the mind can render.It really is insane and makes me think of the computation that the brain can do so efficiently. Like it doesn&#x27;t get everything right -- which is why you&#x27;re really able to get lucid (e.g. you can read something 2 times and it&#x27;ll be different) -- but it is very real regardless. I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of compression going on and some tricks being played but it is often convincing. But what is also insane is that we know even pretty small animals dream in at least some realistic way. My cat tries to run in her sleep, meows, chirps like she does at birds, and wakes up with different emotions. I&#x27;ve had a pet rat do some similar things, at least the feet. It begs the question why this evolved, how important it is (essentially simulating your environment. Like learning from synthetic data, but shower thoughts on steroids), and how this relates to consciousness. And I wonder if we&#x27;ll push harder to make machines do these incredible feats in much smaller packages and without nearly the same training or energy requirements. And I wonder how convincing these simulations are to the smaller creatures. reply qingcharles 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve suffered Hypnagogia several times in my life where I have woken up and can see giant spiders running around my bedroom. I hurt myself once leaping from standing on my bed, over the spiders, to my door so I could switch the light on and attack them. Of course, when the light came on and I turned around the spiders were not there. My brain, not understanding where the \"spiders\" had gone convinced me that they had merely scurried under the furniture to hide, so I spent another couple of minutes trying to find them before I realized I had been punked by my own brain. reply vorpalhex 11 hours agorootparentprev> If going to sleep, these images get more vivid and might classify for something called hypnagogic hallucinationsTry your meditation routine while sitting in a warm shower with a visual focus.

I am like you in that I cannot actually see anything visual in my minds eye but I can still &#x27;visualise&#x27; it. For example, I can rotate a die in my minds eye without actually seeing it. It&#x27;s hard to explain.It was a revelation when I found out that most people can actually see things visually in their minds eye.A friend of mine can actually place imagined objects into their field of view, like AR. reply Semaphor 1 minute agorootparentI can&#x27;t do that. I can somewhat remember what a die is supposed to look like, but I have no image of it whatsoever. It&#x27;s a very abstract memory, like say I \"imagine\"it with a 6 on top. Then I know logically there are 2 times 3 dots, but I can&#x27;t even get an image of that, even trying to think of it makes me lose all other parts of the die. reply layer8 12 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn’t be so sure that what they’re describing isn’t really the same as your “visualization”. I can’t truly see anything in my mind’s eye, same as you and others in this thread, but I can abstractly visualize it, again same as you describe for rotating a die, and I can place that abstract visualization in the 3D space I see before my (open) eyes.I think it’s more likely that others describe this abstract visualization as “seeing” although they don’t really see it, as opposed to them really seeing it as if it were real. As you say, it’s difficult to describe. It’s like a memory of having seen something, and people might describe that as really seeing (because it’s like a memory of really seeing), but in fact it’s not.It’s like hearing a song or other piece of music in your head that you know well, and you can hum or sing along it, but it’s not like you’re actually hearing it. reply bqmjjx0kac 1 hour agorootparentMaybe I&#x27;m weird, but I have a very real auditory experience of music playing in my head. I&#x27;m never confused whether I&#x27;m imagining it, but it has nearly the same fidelity as hearing with my ears.I can&#x27;t conjure up smell&#x2F;taste experiences the same way, but I do have a sort of hollow visualization ability.Edit: I read a few more comments, and it seems I&#x27;m not alone! Now I wonder whether this is common in the general population or just HN. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentI agree with your description, but having the same fidelity is still very different from actually hearing it (having an auditory hallucination). Visualization being more hollow than auditory imagination makes sense because of the much higher bandwidth of visual information.My impression is that individual differences lie much less in the actual mental abilities than in how people interpret and describe those abilities. reply Springtime 9 hours agorootparentprevSeems to me a way of testing the visualization vs hallucination (if I can distinguish it like that) gradient would be the ability to trace visualized&#x2F;&#x27;projected&#x27; objects on paper, particularly for subjects without prior background in illustration&#x2F;draftsmanship (less skill to lean on) and for images which require replication of details they&#x27;re not familiar with (things like dice are relatively geometrically primitive shapes, while say a person&#x27;s face while it can be built up from primitives is inherently complex). Granted part of this would be testing photographic recall.Like you describe I can visualize a lot of things, with fidelity, but it&#x27;s still in my mind&#x27;s eye (that is, a &#x27;sense&#x27; rather than a physically represented image that&#x27;s as apparent as other IRL objects). I can also hone in on details with my eyes open while doing other things. However I can&#x27;t trace such things merely from this sense since they&#x27;re not actually there for me. I can however leverage my draftsmanship skills to be able to focus on the mental visualization&#x2F;sense and progressively draw from memory and for various familiar things visualize them on the paper but not as an optical manifestation. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentYeah, I don’t know how well I&#x27;d be able to draw&#x2F;trace what I can mentally see, but on the other hand I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is a separate ability that can be trained independently from the mental-seeing ability, much like you can train drawing 3D shapes or human anatomy. reply norrius 13 hours agorootparentprev> I can rotate a die in my minds eye without actually seeing it. It&#x27;s hard to explain.I think I&#x27;m the same. It&#x27;s as if I can imagine a geometry, but it doesn&#x27;t have any texture or colour. It&#x27;s not black, not grey, not brown... It&#x27;s a shape in its pure form, maybe like a wireframe, without a physical manifestation.However, I can imagine music and actually hear it.

All inside my head. reply Dunati 1 hour agorootparentThis is very similar to my experience. For example, I can visualise 3 stacked poker chips, and I can move than around and restack them. But if I try to make them different colours, I can&#x27;t, similar to how I might keep track of real ones with me eyes closed. I can remember the blue one is on top, but if I start rotating them, taking the bottom one out and putting it on top, I quickly lose track of which one is which.I also feel like songs I replay in my head (which I do constantly, and without a choice in the song) have very high fidelity. reply Ericson2314 12 hours agorootparentprevI definitely do abstract shapes more often, but I thought but and I could do some lightinghttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Utah_teapot#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Utah_t...

I have a very hard time getting an actual realistic picture, with color and detail, in my head. At most its a faint and hazy thing. And while I don&#x27;t have face-blindness - I recognize people from their faces easily - picturing the faces of even close friends and family members in my head is very hard, and mostly comes down to a few half-remembered features, tied to words.But a geometry, or set of relations between objects (whether that&#x27;s connections or just relative positioning, like a map) is pretty easy, and I can move around, rotate and focus on the geometry with less effort than it takes to imagine, say, an apple.But familiar music can be played back in my head with only a little effort, or a slight reminder. Not just the lyrics, or the melody, but the full audio as I heard it, missing only background parts that my mind didn&#x27;t \"catch\". Rarely (a couple times a year), I&#x27;ll get a partial song \"stuck\" and won&#x27;t be able to get it out of my head until I track it down and listen to it until the end. I can&#x27;t \"invent\" a tune though, just replay ones I&#x27;ve heard several times. reply qingcharles 10 hours agorootparentInteresting. I&#x27;m the same. I can&#x27;t visualize anything in my head, but I can play back songs as perfect audio with the lyrics and all the music. I&#x27;m playing Moby in my head right now. But, like you, I often have to go find the music to physically listen to in order to end the earworm. reply actionfromafar 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you are slightly to the aphantasia side of a spectrum. I can do the same as you but with colors. reply zeehio 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen I had to study and memorize some text at school I used to remember the page where the text was written and then mentally read it. Some of those pages are still in my head (for instance multiplication tables).Once I was on an exam and I could not understand my own writing in the page I was remembering because I had written it too small on the corner. It was frustrating to not be able to answer the question. Afterwards, when I went to my real notes and I struggled to understand what was written there. I was happy that my memory image was accurate although frustrated for not managing the space in the page properly.I thought everyone could remember things in this way.Sometimes I have to write things down to see them and remember them, because mental speeches are harder (and less efficient) for me to remember.I guess there are many ways to learn and remember stuff we just have to find the one that works better for us.Being a teacher should require knowing about all this learning diversity I guess. reply thinkingemote 13 hours agorootparentI find reading from paper books better than digital for this reason. Spatial memory. Its quick for me to find a passage as I seem to know where to look. I don&#x27;t remember the words or the passage I want but I know where to locate it.

This is a really interesting thread. I always thought people were much the same. But recently I also learned that my wife just sees words when reading a book whereas I see a “movie”.Also I will project words in my mind to inspect them visually to see how to spell them, and if they look ok. And when studying I recall pages of books with the info in the place where it is printed, much like zeehio describes. This is super helpful when memorizing entire books ie when I studied biology.But from this thread I still get the idea there are people that really really see things, whereas for me it stops at “visualizing”. Which does help when composing a picture but perhaps there is more? I think I’ll try this exercise.One weird thing I often did (or try to do, doesn’t always work) as a kid is stare into the blackness of my closed eyes until I sort of got convinced there was a massive boulder looming over me. It would feel quite real and I’d really feel the massiveness and it would make me feel very small and even make me feel adrift. Strange, this thread actually made me remember, didn’t really do that for a long time now. reply colordrops 2 hours agorootparentI have a feeling that, unless you are blind due to illness of the brain, that everyone has the capability to visualize internally. This would include your wife when she is reading. I think they difference is that some people have access to this visualization consciously, with their frontal cortex, and for others it&#x27;s subconscious. If you didn&#x27;t have this visualization, I believe it would be really hard to commit what you read to memory and have any sense of a story.When I meditate, one of the practices is to label thoughts as they arise. When you do this, you realize that a huge amount of thoughts pass by subconsciously. You notice them more and more as you label them, but it feels like a deep rabbit hole of thought that I haven&#x27;t gotten to the bottom of yet.edit: just looked at the article and realized that the technique is essentially thought labeling.

First, I could approach it as remembering, maybe not a car I saw yesterday, but a generic idea of some type of car. For example if I thought about a Japanese pickup or a Lamborghini, I would probably answer the following color question with \"white\" and \"orange\", because for me those are stereotypic colors that \"come with\" the memory. Perhaps many people think in this way and thus assume the color obviously is there.The second way would be to abstractly build a car in my mind. Start with four tires, put a rough shape of a frame on it — lets make it a sedan. If I proceed this way, I probably would not choose a color, at least not early on. Like many in this thread, this is how I usually imagine things, as \"wireframes\". The color&#x2F;texture is not there because I have not assigned it. I can&#x27;t vividly see the things I imagine, but they can still have color just like they can have shape. reply donpark 12 hours agoparentprevIt &#x27;feels like&#x27; like seeing.

Rest of the view is filled with &#x27;feels like they are there&#x27;.

I&#x27;m definitely seeing them even though my eyes are closed.

I don&#x27;t need to close my eyes to do see it (but it helps). I can draw to it, with some effort . Daydreams get painted on it when my mind drifts. It&#x27;s the stage on which I experience memories.Most people are like this, with variation in the degree of vividness and control. Some people can make realistic detailed scenes, for other people it&#x27;s harder and their images are often blotchy or lacking in detail and colour. I&#x27;m in the latter group.If you don&#x27;t have any of this at all and you&#x27;re surprised by the whole idea, you are probably aphantasic. reply doug-moen 10 hours agoparentprevI can imagine imagery in two different ways.1. One way is the \"behind the eyelids\" technique, where the imagery seems to be coming from the retina, or at least I experience it that way. I cannot currently generate the high quality photographic imagery of the OP, and even the experience of colour is pretty sketchy. That&#x27;s today, awake, although sometimes it gets better when I&#x27;m in bed and about to fall asleep. Either way, this only works if my eyes are closed, or it&#x27;s pitch dark. With my eyes open, the signal from my retina washes out the image, which is very dim. One person I met who experiences this calls the experience \"phosphenes\". The experience doesn&#x27;t look real, and I have no sense of depth or spatial location, like I do with vision. It is only partially under conscious control. I get images, then I \"make suggestions\" about what I want to see, and then it kind of drifts in the direction of what I want.2. The other way works with my eyes open. I can do 3D objects, even set up a wire frame cube spinning around my head. The object can be \"inside my mind\" with no defined location, or I can locate it in space. I barely have any colour available in this subsystem, but that could be lack of practice. This is under full conscious control. I have no difficulty distinguishing these images from what I am seeing, I experience eyesight and these images as two different mental domains.I just ran a test, and I can do both things at the same time, but it requires a lot of concentration and I&#x27;m not good at it.I know from talking to people that there is a lot of variation in how people experience mental imagery.Based on what I&#x27;ve read, LSD and psilocybin hallucinations may be be a more powerful version of \"system 1\" imagery as described above. That&#x27;s because: at low doses, you can only see the hallucinations with your eyes closed, and they are only partially under conscious control. (There are instructions on the web on how to influence the imagery.)UPDATE: I wondered whether my system 1 imagery is \"in the retina\" or \"in the visual cortex\". As an experiment, I stared at a bright light, then closed my eyes to see the retinal afterimage of the bright light. Everybody gets these afterimages. Then, I was able to modify the afterimage! After some work, I eventually changed the colour of the afterimage and made it into the centre of a flower. To my delight, the flower had an almost photographic quality. This doesn&#x27;t really prove anything about retina vs visual cortex. But this is a better result than I&#x27;ve had in the past, before I read the ideas in this post.Finally, the OP and video describes \"image streaming\", which seems to be a more advanced version of what I do when I try to shape a system 1 \"retinal\" image. Afterimages are one way to produce a seed image. In the past I&#x27;ve just created images starting from a black visual field, but I guess it&#x27;s easier if you start with a seed. Apparently if you get really good then you can have full conscious control over system 1 mental imagery! I had not previously considered talking out loud to influence the image.Now I&#x27;m wondering whether \"microdosing\", a Silicon valley practice that has been discussed on HN before, would improve your ability to perform \"image streaming\".

I don&#x27;t have very good conscious control of it, but if I start \"daydreaming\" the images can pretty much override what my eyes are seeing. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s overlaying like AR, for me it&#x27;s more like tuning in to a different channel.

I can pop things in and out of reality as needed to visualize things. Of course the counter to this scares me thinking about what happens if I did this without conscious awareness...My dreams can feel more real than reality too. Like full senses lucid dreams. Looking at things like clocks and books worked in my dreams. My dreams are just a reality inside the reality everyone else shares.Also, In my teens and early 20s I had dreams I could levitate.

When I try to imagine something I don&#x27;t get any visuals, even the visual processing equivalent of subvocalization. Sometimes I can get a flicker of an outline or something but I can&#x27;t hold the concept and it&#x27;ll dissolve inside a second. I used to be a pretty good artist working from photos, but I can&#x27;t compose in my head. At all.But I do also know what familiar things look like more or less, and I can easily imagine layouts of buildings I know really well. I can explain those things verbally fine.But it registers more in the way you might expect if you were encountering the object in darkness, or became blind after thoroughly learning the object as a sighted person. I imagine aspects of the object or scene in relationship to each other, sort of feeling over it with my mind, and cross-referencing with facts I remember about it. I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about--being able to conceptualize it rather than visualize it.I did manage to imagine \"blue\" once during meditation, though, and that was pretty cool. I really saw it when I did--my whole visual field behind my closed eyes seemed sky blue. Normally I just see clouds of purplish dots on a black field, if there&#x27;s no light shining through my eyelids, and it&#x27;s been that way all my life. That experience, more than anything, convinced me people who say they \"see\" stuff in their mind&#x27;s eye really do see stuff.I&#x27;m definitely going to check out the linked technique.

I hear the beeping of cash registers and the murmur of people talking. One wheel is bad on the shopping cart and it squeaks and pulls to the left. The handle of the cart is smooth plastic, it’s translucent but with a red stripe painted on it. I reach for the cucumbers and I can see that they’re waxy but also the end of the first one I see is wrinkly, meaning that it’s starting to shrivel. You get the idea. I see it all in detail and I can feel certain sensations and hear sound too. Yeah visualizing with that much detail takes effort but I can do more than just visualize an apple.It’s not exactly the same as watching a movie.

I can imagine tunes but they are not accompanied by the timbre and richness of actual sounds. They&#x27;re more of an abstraction. This is something I&#x27;ve made actual progress on, though. As a byproduct of learning sight-singing and transcription (as an adult, starting with movable-do sol-fa), I am able to hear sounds much more convincingly at times.

I would never call it visualising though reply sergioisidoro 52 minutes agorootparentI think most people with some degeree of aphantasia used to think like you - that no one can really visualise things.But then I started asking around and people REALLY described visualisation as a vivid clear picture of things in their heads, almost like they are there. Like literally projecting the image on their brain as you&#x27;re saying.I now think I do have some degree of aphantasia. I can describe as having low RAM, so I cannot paint the entire scene. I am able to briefly visualise some details and aspects of a scene (usually as flashes, and I cannot sustain them), but never the entire scene. If you ask me to visualise a beach, I can have visual \"flashy\" perceptions of the sand or the waves, but it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to put everything together in a visual manner. It&#x27;s much easer for me to imagine the feelings, sounds, and smells of a scene. reply deadbeeves 6 hours agorootparentprevFrom talking to people, I would say it exists on a spectrum. I can imagine an apple, the color and texture of its skin, how it feels to touch it, its weightiness, its smell, the sound it&#x27;ll make when I bite into it, as well as its taste and texture. I can imagine it at different levels of ripeness too, although I don&#x27;t have the same amount of information for all of them. For me it&#x27;s so clear that it&#x27;s almost as good as the real thing.Some people I&#x27;ve talked to said they couldn&#x27;t do most of that. They said they could think of an apple, but couldn&#x27;t tell me much more about it, other than that it was an apple. Now, obviously I can&#x27;t peer into their heads. Were they actually imagining more but were unable to put it into words? Were they underestimating the vividness of what they were imagining? Or were they accurately describing what was in their minds?

I was struck by the fact that she is an avid reader and enjoys fiction. She said she processes descriptive text as facts. Like, if she read, \"Raindrops glistened in the afternoon light as they rolled off the red maple leafs, falling peacefully to the lush green grass, below,\" she would just have a list of facts in her head and no visualization.

For example in grade school I was certain I was among the few that read the most, yet for in class creative writing assignments I am often among the last to finish. I&#x27;ve always had the suspicion I&#x27;m not as creative as others for this reason.That said I do believe that I&#x27;m very analytical, and so I found no untoward difficulty in persuasive essays, technical write-ups, etc. reply moffkalast 30 minutes agorootparentprev> Were they actually imagining more but were unable to put it into words?

The object is only as detailed as you make it in your mind, which might take some creativity if you&#x27;re not thinking about a specific one you&#x27;ve seen before.

So I presume that a great musician is able to imagine certain instruments clearly in his head. At least a friend told me that he could do this. And a master chef will probably be able to imagine the taste of different ingredients.I however cannot. At times this realization feels quite sad.

I then can just fall a sleep given that I am tired enough. She never understood that.Were this held me back in my life is drawing and chess playing.

It looks a lot like what you&#x27;d see if you were in a dark room with a sink full of water that is draining, and there was a drop of some glowing dye in the water which is circling the drain and expanding.3. Gears, pistons, linkages, pulleys, wheels, etc forming elaborate moving mechanisms. I have no idea what the mechanisms are doing or if any of the mechanisms are sensible or even possible. I&#x27;m very much not mechanically inclined and so this is the most puzzling nighttime visualization to me.4. Plants. I seem to be flying low over land with patches of grass, flowers, and trees. The scene is quite detailed, with individual leaves and blades of grass visible, and any gaps between things filled with things farther behind, giving a strong sense of 3D.5. Animals. Unlike the plants of #4 that I see in a full environment if I see animals they are just kind of there against the brown&#x2F;black background. Sometimes they are normal animals, and sometimes they are weird creatures that belong in science fiction or mythology. The animals often morph into other animals. reply __lain__ 10 hours agoparent> 3.

Lazarus operators obtained initial access to the company’s network last year after a successful spearphishing campaign, masquerading as a recruiter for Meta – the company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The fake recruiter contacted the victim via LinkedIn Messaging, a feature within the LinkedIn professional social networking platform, and sent two coding challenges required as part of a hiring process, which the victim downloaded and executed on a company device. The first challenge is a very basic project that displays the text “Hello, World!”, the second one prints a Fibonacci sequence – a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. ESET Research was able to reconstruct the initial access steps and analyze the toolset used by Lazarus thanks to cooperation with the affected aerospace company. In this blogpost, we describe the method of infiltration and the tools deployed during this Lazarus attack. We will also present some of our findings about this attack at the Virus Bulletin conference on October 4, 2023. Key points of the blogpost: Employees of the targeted company were contacted by a fake recruiter via LinkedIn and tricked into opening a malicious executable presenting itself as a coding challenge or quiz. We identified four different execution chains, delivering three types of payloads via DLL side-loading . The most notable payload is the LightlessCan backdoor, implementing techniques to hinder detection by real-time security monitoring software and analysis by cybersecurity professionals; this presents a major shift in comparison with its predecessor BlindingCan, a flagship HTTP(S) Lazarus RAT. We attribute this activity with a high level of confidence to Lazarus, particularly to its campaigns related to Operation DreamJob. The final goal of the attack was cyberespionage. Lazarus delivered various payloads to the victims’ systems; the most notable is a publicly undocumented and sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) that we named LightlessCan, which represents a significant advancement compared to its predecessor, BlindingCan. LightlessCan mimics the functionalities of a wide range of native Windows commands, enabling discreet execution within the RAT itself instead of noisy console executions. This strategic shift enhances stealthiness, making detecting and analyzing the attacker’s activities more challenging. Another mechanism used to minimize exposure is the employment of execution guardrails; Lazarus made sure the payload can only be decrypted on the intended victim’s machine. Execution guardrails are a set of protective protocols and mechanisms implemented to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of the payload during its deployment and execution, effectively preventing unauthorized decryption on unintended machines, such as those of security researchers. We describe the implementation of this mechanism in the Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version) section. Attribution to the Lazarus group The Lazarus group (also known as HIDDEN COBRA) is a cyberespionage group linked to North Korea that has been active since at least 2009. It is responsible for high-profile incidents such as both the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and tens-of-millions-of-dollar cyberheists in 2016, the WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, the 3CX and X_TRADER supply-chain attacks, and a long history of disruptive attacks against South Korean public and critical infrastructure since at least 2011. The diversity, number, and eccentricity in implementation of Lazarus campaigns define this group, as well as that it performs all three pillars of cybercriminal activities: cyberespionage, cybersabotage, and pursuit of financial gain. Aerospace companies are not an unusual target for North Korea-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The country has conducted multiple nuclear tests and launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, which violate United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions. The UN monitors North Korea’s nuclear activities to prevent further development and proliferation of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, and publishes biannual reports tracking such activities. According to these reports, North Korea-aligned APT groups attack aerospace companies in attempts to access sensitive technology and aerospace know-how, as intercontinental ballistic missiles spend their midcourse phase in the space outside of Earth’s atmosphere. These reports also claim that money gained from cyberattacks accounts for a portion of North Korea’s missile development costs. We attribute the attack in Spain to the Lazarus group, specifically to Operation DreamJob, with a high level of confidence. The name for Operation DreamJob was coined in a blogpost by ClearSky from August 2020, describing a Lazarus campaign targeting defense and aerospace companies, with the objective of cyberespionage. Since then, we have loosely used the term to denote various Lazarus operations leveraging job-offering lures but not deploying tools clearly similar to those involved in its other activities, such as Operation In(ter)ception. For example, the campaign involving tools signed with 2 TOY GUYS certificates (see ESET Threat Report T1 2021, page 11), and the case of Amazon-themed lures in the Netherlands and Belgium published in September 2022. Our attribution is based on the following factors, which show a relationship mostly with the previously mentioned Amazon-themed campaign: 1. Malware (the intrusion set): Initial access was obtained by making contact via LinkedIn and then convincing the target to execute malware, disguised as a test, in order to succeed in a hiring process. This is a known Lazarus tactic, used at least since Operation DreamJob. We observed new variants of payloads that were previously identified in the Dutch case from last year, such as intermediate loaders and the BlindingCan backdoor linked with Lazarus. Multiple types of strong encryption were leveraged in the tools of this Lazarus campaign – AES-128 and RC6 with a 256-bit key – that were also used in the Amazon-themed campaign. 2. Infrastructure: For the first-level C&C servers (listed in the Network section at the end of this blogpost), the attackers do not set up their own servers, but compromise existing ones, usually those having poor security and that host sites with neglected maintenance. This is a typical, yet weak-confidence behavior, of Lazarus. 3. Cui bono: Pilfering the know-how of an aerospace company is aligned with long-term goals manifested by Lazarus. Initial access The group targeted multiple company employees via LinkedIn Messaging. Masquerading as a Meta recruiter, the attacker used a job offer lure to attract the target’s attention and trust; a screenshot of this conversation, which we obtained during our cooperation with the Spanish aerospace company, is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. The initial contact by the attacker impersonating a recruiter from Meta At the beginning of Lazarus attacks, the unaware targets are usually convinced to recklessly self-compromise their systems. For this purpose, the attackers employ different strategies; for example, the target is lured to execute an attacker-provided (and trojanized) PDF viewer to see the full content of a job offer. Alternately, the target is encouraged to connect with a trojanized SSL/VPN client, being provided with an IP address and login details. Both scenarios are described in a Microsoft blogpost published in September 2022. The narrative in this case was the scammer’s request to prove the victim’s proficiency in the C++ programming language. Two malicious executables, Quiz1.exe and Quiz2.exe, were provided for that purpose and delivered via the Quiz1.iso and Quiz2.iso images hosted on a third-party cloud storage platform. Both executables are very simple command line applications asking for input. The first one is a Hello World project, which is a very basic program, often consisting of just a single line of code, that displays the text “Hello, World!” when executed. The second prints a Fibonacci sequence up to the largest element smaller than the number entered as input. A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1; however, in this malicious challenge, the sequence starts with 1 and 2. Figure 2 displays example output from the Fibonacci sequence challenge. After the output is printed, both executables trigger the malicious action of installing additional payloads from the ISO images onto the target’s system. The task for a targeted developer is to understand the logic of the program and rewrite it in the C++ programming language. Figure 2. The output of the decoy program Quiz2.exe The chain of events that led to the initial compromise is sketched in Figure 3. The first payload delivered to the target’s system is an HTTP(S) downloader that we have named NickelLoader. The tool allows the attackers to deploy any desired program into the memory of the victim’s computer. Figure 3. The chain of events completing the initial access Post-compromise toolset Once NickelLoader is running on the target’s system, the attackers use it to deliver two types of RATs. One of these RATs is already known to be part of the Lazarus toolkit, specifically a variant of the BlindingCan backdoor with limited functionality but identical command processing logic. To distinguish it, we put the prefix mini- in front of the variant’s name. Additionally, the attackers introduced a RAT not previously undocumented publicly, which we have named LightlessCan. The RATs are deployed as the final step of chains of stages with varying levels of complexity and are preceded by helper executables, like droppers and loaders. We denote an executable as a dropper if it contains an embedded payload, even if it’s not dropped onto the file system but instead loaded directly into memory and executed. Malware that doesn’t have an encrypted embedded data array, but that loads a payload from the file system, we denote as a loader. Besides the initial quiz-related lures, Table 1 summarizes the executable files (EXEs) and dynamic link libraries (DLLs) delivered to the victim’s system. All the malware samples in the third column are trojanized open-source applications (see the fourth column for the underlying project), with a legitimate executable side-loading a malicious DLL. For example, the malicious mscoree.dll is a trojanized version of the legitimate NppyPluginDll; the DLL contains an embedded NickelLoader and is loaded by a legitimate PresentationHost.exe, both located in the C:\\ProgramShared directory. Table 1. Summary of binaries involved in the attack Location directory Legitimate parent process Malicious side-loaded DLL Trojanized project (payload) C:\\ProgramShared\\ PresentationHost.exe mscoree.dll NppyPluginDll (NickelLoader) C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\ colorcpl.exe colorui.dll LibreSSL 2.6.5 (miniBlindingCan) C:\\ProgramData\\Oracle\\Java\\ fixmapi.exe mapistub.dll Lua plugin for Notepad++ 1.4.0.0 (LightlessCan) C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\ARM\\ tabcal.exe HID.dll MZC8051 for Notepad++ 3.2 (LightlessCan) LightlessCan – new backdoor The most interesting payload used in this campaign is LightlessCan, a successor of the group’s flagship HTTP(S) Lazarus RAT named BlindingCan. LightlessCan is a new complex RAT that has support for up to 68 distinct commands, indexed in a custom function table, but in the current version, 1.0, only 43 of those commands are implemented with some functionality. The remaining commands are present but have a formal implementation in the form of placeholders, lacking actual functionality. The project behind the RAT is definitely based on the BlindingCan source code, as the order of the shared commands is preserved significantly, even though there may be differences in their indexing. The most significant update is mimicked functionality of many native Windows commands like ping, ipconfig, systeminfo, sc, net, etc. The hardcoded string “The operation completed successfully.”, the standard system message for the ERROR_SUCCESS result, brought us to that idea. Table 2 contains a list of those commands that are implemented in LightlessCan. In previously reported Lazarus attacks, as documented in blogposts by Positive Technologies in April 2021 and HvS Consulting in December 2020, these native commands are often executed in many instances after the attackers have gotten a foothold in the target’s system. However, in this case, these commands are executed discreetly within the RAT itself, rather than being executed visibly in the system console. This approach offers a significant advantage in terms of stealthiness, both in evading real-time monitoring solutions like EDRs, and postmortem digital forensic tools. The internal version number (1.0) indicates that this represents a new development effort by the attackers. As the core utilities of Windows are proprietary and not open-source, the developers of LightlessCan faced a choice: either to reverse engineer the closed-source system binaries or to get inspired by the code available via the Wine project, where many programs are rewritten in order to mimic their execution on other platforms like Linux, macOS, or ChromeOS. We are inclined to believe the developers chose the first option, as the corresponding Wine programs they mimicked in LightlessCan were implemented a little bit differently or not at all (e.g., netsh). Interestingly, in one of the cases we analyzed, the LightlessCan payload is stored in an encrypted file on the compromised machine, which can only be decrypted using an environment-dependent key. More details about this can be found in the Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version) section. This is to ensure that the payload can only be decrypted on the computer of the intended victim and not, for example, on a device of a security researcher. Table 2. The list of LightlessCan commands mimicking those for Windows prompt Index Description 33 Mimic the ipconfig command from the Windows command prompt; see Figure 4. 34 Mimic the net command from the Windows prompt; see Figure 5. 35 Mimic the netshadvfirewall firewall command from the Windows prompt; see Figure 4. 36 Mimic the netstat command from the Windows prompt. 37 Mimic the ping -6 command from the Windows prompt. 38 Mimic the reg command from the Windows prompt; see Figure 7. 39 Mimic the sc command from the Windows prompt; see Figure 8. 40 Mimic the ping command from the Windows prompt. 41 Mimic the tasklist command from the Windows prompt. 42 Mimic the wmic process call create command from the Windows prompt; see Figure 9. 43 Mimic the nslookup command from the Windows Server prompt. 44 Mimic the schstasks command from the Windows prompt; see Figure 10. 45 Mimic the systeminfo command from the Windows prompt. 46 Mimic the arp command from the Windows prompt. 47 Mimic the mkdir command from the Windows prompt.

Hardcoded strings revealing the (partial) schtasks functionality Furthermore, an examination of the RAT’s internal configuration suggests that, in comparison to BlindingCan, Lazarus increased the code sophistication in LightlessCan. Technical analysis In this section, we provide technical details about the compromise chain that delivers the NickelLoader downloader, and the three execution chains Lazarus used to deliver its payloads on the compromised system. Compromise chain: NickelLoader NickelLoader is an HTTP(S) downloader executed on the compromised system via DLL side-loading, which is later used to deliver other Lazarus payloads. The process of delivering NickelLoader unfolds in a series of stages, commencing with the execution of PresentationHost.exe, which is triggered automatically after the target manually executes the initial quiz challenges; the Quiz1 case is depicted in Figure 3. A malicious dynamically linked library, mscoree.dll, is then side-loaded by the legitimate PresentationHost.exe – both located in C:\\ProgramShared\\. This DLL is a trojanized NppyPluginDll.dll, from the inactive General Python Plugins DLL for Notepad++ project from 2011. It serves as a dropper and has various exports: all the exports copied from the original NppyPluginDll.dll plus all the exports from the legitimate mscoree.dll. One of these legitimate exports, CorExitProcess, contains the malicious code responsible for the decryption and execution of the next malware stage. To successfully decrypt an encrypted data array embedded in the dropper, three 16-character-long keywords are required by the dropper. These keywords are as follows: the name of the parent process (PresentationHost), the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (9zCnQP6o78753qg8), and the external parameter passed on the command line (‑embeddingObject), which is inherited from the parent process of PresentationHost.exe, being provided by Quiz1.exe or Quiz2.exe. The keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms the AES-128 decryption key. The payload is an HTTP(S) downloader that recognizes four commands, all five letters long, shown in Table 3. Because of those five letter commands, we chose to name this payload “NickelLoader”, drawing inspiration from the colloquial term for the US five-cent coin – a nickel. The most important commands are avdrq and gabnc. When these commands are issued, each of them loads data received from the C&C server as a DLL. For this purpose, the attackers probably used MemoryModule, a library that can be used to load a DLL completely from memory. Table 3. The list of magic keywords recognized in received buffers Keyword Description abcde Requests another immediate command without the usual long sleep delay that separates the execution of the commands. avdrq Loads a DLL contained in the received buffer and executes its hardcoded export info. gabnc Loads a DLL contained in the received buffer. dcrqvTerminates itself. Execution chain 1: miniBlindingCan One of the payloads downloaded and executed by NickelLoader is miniBlindingCan, a simplified version of the group’s flagship BlindingCan RAT. It was reported for the first time by Mandiant in September 2022, under the name AIRDRY.V2. To load miniBlindingCan, a 64-bit malicious dynamically linked library colorui.dll is side-loaded by a legitimate colorcpl.exe executed from C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\ and serves as a dropper. The DLL is obfuscated using VMProtect and contains thousands of exports from which LaunchColorCpl is the most important, as it handles the execution of the next stage. There’s an encrypted data array in the DLL’s dumped body, together with multiple debug symbols revealing the root directory and the project from which it was built: W:\\Develop\\aTool\\ShellCodeLoader\\App\\libressl-2.6.5\\ As the name ShellCodeLoader suggests, the main purpose of this initial stage is to decrypt and load the data array from its body, which contains shellcode. At the beginning of its execution, ShellCodeLoader employs anti-debugging techniques by inspecting the BeingDebugged value within the Process Environment Block (PEB) structure to determine if it’s being scrutinized or analyzed by debugging tools, and utilizes anti-sandbox techniques to avoid detection within sandboxed environments designed for security analysis. The malware also explicitly checks whether its parent process is colorcpl.exe; if not, it exits immediately. The decrypted data array is not a complete DLL, but forms an intermediate blob with two parts: shellcode followed by another encrypted data array, which represents the last step of the chain. The shellcode seems to be produced by an instance of the open-source project ShellcodeRDI – in particular, the ShellcodeRDI.c code. It was probably produced by executing the Python script ConvertToShellcode.py from this project on a payload DLL acting as a source for reflective DLL injection. The final payload is extracted and decrypted using XOR with a long key, which is a string built by concatenating the name of the parent process (colorcpl.exe), the filename of the dropper (colorui.dll), and the external command line parameter – in this case resulting in COLORCPL.EXECOLORUI.DLL669498484488D3F22712CC5BACA6B7A7. This process is akin to what we observed with BlindingCan backdoor in the Dutch case we previously described in this WeLiveSecurity blogpost. The decryption reveals an executable with download-and-execute functionality, whose internal logic of sending and parsing commands is strongly reminiscent of BlindingCan, a flagship HTTP(S) Lazarus RAT. Unlike the case in the Netherlands, it is not VMProtect-ed and it supports only a small subset of commands available previously: compare Table 4in this blogpost and Table 3 in the blogpost on the Dutch case from September 2022. Because the features of this RAT are notably scaled down compared to those in BlindingCan, and yet they seem to share the same server-side infrastructure, we have chosen to distinguish it by appending the prefix “mini-“ to its name, highlighting its reduced functionality compared to its fully-featured RAT counterpart. Table 4. Commands of miniBlindingCan Command ID Description 8201 Send system information like computer name, Windows version, and code page. 8232 Update the current communication interval with a value provided by the C&C server. 8233 Discontinue the command execution. 8241 Send the current configuration of size 9,392 bytes to the C&C server. 8242 Update the configuration of size 9,392 bytes, stored encrypted on the file system. 8247 Wait for the next command. 8248 Update the current communication interval with a value stored in the configuration. 8274 Download and decrypt a file from the C&C server. 8279 Execute shellcode passed as a parameter. Figure 11 shows the decrypted state of a 9,392-byte-long configuration embedded in the RAT. It contains five URLs, in this case compromised websites, each limited by a maximum size of 260 wide characters. Figure 11. A configuration of the miniBlindingCan backdoor. The highlighted value is the count of URLs, but only the first and the last of the five URLs are shown here. The purpose of the last two wide strings is not known Execution chain 2: LightlessCan (simple version) Another payload we have seen executed by NickelLoader is LightlessCan, a new Lazarus backdoor. We have observed two different chains loading this backdoor. In the simple version of the chain, the dropper of this payload is the malicious dynamically linked library mapistub.dll that is side-loaded by the legitimate fixmapi.exe executed from C:\\ProgramData\\Oracle\\Java\\. The DLL is a trojanized Lua plugin, version 1.4, with all the exports copied from the legitimate Windows mapi32.dll. The export FixMAPI contains malicious code responsible for decrypting and loading the next stage; all the other exports contain benign code sourced from a publicly available MineSweeper sample project. This mapistub.dll dropper has persistence established via a scheduled task. Unfortunately, we lack additional details about this task, except that its parent process appears as %WINDOWS%\\system32\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule. To successfully decrypt the embedded data array, the dropper needs three keywords to be provided correctly: the name of the parent process (fixmapi.exe), the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (IP7pdINfE9uMz63n), and the external parameter passed in the command line (AudioEndpointBuilder). The keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms a 128-bit AES key to be used for decryption. Note that the length of the keywords are not all exactly 16 bytes, but the decryption process will still work if the oversized string is truncated to a 16-byte length (for instance, AudioEndpointBuilder to AudioEndpointBui), and the undersized string, fixmapi.exe, is treated as fixmapi.exe\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00, because the string was initialized as 260 instances of the NUL character. Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version) The most complex chain we observed on the compromised system also delivers LightlessCan, with various components involved in the complete chain of installation stages: a legitimate application, an initial dropper, a complete dropper (which contains the configuration), an intermediate dropper, a configuration file, a file with system information (for the decryption of encrypted payloads on the file system), an intermediate loader and the final step, the LightlessCan RAT. The connections and relationships among these files are illustrated in Figure 12. Figure 12. A complex chain of stages delivering the fourth payload The initial dropper of the fourth chain is a malicious dynamically linked library HID.dll that is side-loaded by a legitimate executable, tabcal.exe, executed from C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\ARM\\. The DLL is a trojanized version of MZC8051.dll, a legitimate file from the 8051 C compiler plugin project for Notepad++. It contains all the exports from the original project, but also the necessary exports from the legitimate Hid User Library by Microsoft, so that the side-loading by tabcal.exe will be successful. The export HidD_GetHidGuid contains the malicious code responsible for dropping the next stage and, as in the case of the dropper of the previous chain (Execution chain 2), all the other exports contain the benign MineSweeper code. As in the previous cases, three long keywords must be provided to decrypt the embedded payload: the name of the parent process (tabcal.exe), the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (9zCnQP6o78753qg8), and the external parameter (LocalServiceNetworkRestricted) – this time not expressed as a command line parameter, but instead as the content of a file located at %WINDOWS%\\system32\\thumbs.db. Again, the keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms a 128-bit AES key to be used for the decryption. As in the previous case, the lengths of the keywords are not all exactly 16 bytes, but the decryption will still work if the oversized string is truncated (for instance, to LocalServiceNetw) and the undersized string is extended with nulls (for instance, to tabcal.exe\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00). The executable produced by the above recipe is the complete dropper from Figure 12 and has the InternalName resource AppResolver.dll (found in the VERSIONINFO resource). It contains two encrypted data arrays: a small one of 126 bytes, and a large one of 1,807,464 bytes (which contains three subparts). First, it decrypts the small array using the RC6 algorithm with the hardcoded 256-bit key DA 48 A3 14 8D BF E2 D2 EF 91 12 11 FF 75 59 A3 E1 6E A0 64 B8 78 89 77 A0 37 91 58 5A FF FF 07. The output represents paths to which the first two subparts of the large blob are dropped (i.e., LightlessCan and the intermediate dropper), and yields the strings C:\\windows\\system32\\oci.dll and C:\\windows\\system32\\grpedit.dat. Next, it continues with decrypting the second data array – the large blob – using the same encryption key as before. The result is a decrypted blob containing three subparts: a DLL corresponding to grpedit.dat (LightlessCan), a DLL corresponding to oci.dll (the intermediate dropper), and a 14,948 byte encrypted file dropped to %WINDOWS%\\System32\\wlansvc.cpl (configuration); as depicted in Figure 13. Figure 13. The decrypted configuration stored in wlansvc.cpl Moreover, the complete dropper also stores several characteristics identifying the compromised system in the file %WINDOWS%\\System32\\4F59FB87DF2F, whose name is hardcoded in the binary. These characteristics are primarily retrieved from the Computer\\HKLM\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\BIOS registry path. Here are the specific values of these characteristics, along with a PowerShell command provided in brackets that can be used to display the corresponding value on any Windows machine: SystemBIOSDate (Get-ItemProperty \"HKLM:\\HARDWARE\\Description\\System\\BIOS\" -Name BIOSReleaseDateSelect-Object -Property BIOSReleaseDate) SystemBIOSVersion (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BiosSelect-Object -Property Version) SystemManufacturer (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystemSelect-Object -Property Manufacturer) SystemProductName (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystemProductSelect-Object -Property Name) Identifier in Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\MultifunctionAdapter\\0\\DiskController\\0\\DiskPeripheral\\0 The concatenation of the values is required for decryption of the encrypted grpedit.dat from the file system. On a test machine running an image of Windows 10 on VMWare, the output can be: 11/12/20INTEL - 6040000VMware, Inc.VMware Virtual Platform656ba047-20b25a2a-A The oci.dll file is another dropping layer – the intermediate dropper that drops the intermediate loader, which is a payload similar to the one described in the previously mentioned Dutch case. Again, the attackers used an open-source project, the Flashing Tip plugin for Notepad++, which is no longer available online. Unlike the previous cases, only two long keywords must be provided in order to decrypt the embedded payload successfully using AES-128: the name of the parent process (msdtc.exe), and the internal parameter hardcoded in the binary (fb5XPNCr8v83Y85P). Both keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte (the parent process name is truncated, or padded with NULLs, as necessary to fill 16 bytes). The product of the decryption is the intermediate loader (LLTMapperAPI.dll). It uses the system information (same as the values stored in 4F59FB87DF2F) to decrypt the configuration file wlansvc.cpl and to locate, decrypt, and load the encrypted grpedit.dat, which is LightlessCan, the new full-featured RAT. Conclusion We have described a new Lazarus attack that originated on LinkedIn where fake recruiters approached their potential victims, who were using corporate computers for personal purposes. Even though public awareness of these types of attacks should be high, the success rates of these campaigns have still not dropped to zero. The most worrying aspect of the attack is the new type of payload, LightlessCan, a complex and possibly evolving tool that exhibits a high level of sophistication in its design and operation, representing a significant advancement in malicious capabilities compared to its predecessor, BlindingCan. The attackers can now significantly limit the execution traces of their favorite Windows command line programs that are heavily used in their post-compromise activity. This maneuver has far-reaching implications, impacting the effectiveness of both real-time monitoring solutions and of post-mortem digital forensic tools.

Tactic ID Name Description Reconnaissance T1593.001 Search Open Websites/Domains: Social Media Lazarus attackers used LinkedIn to identify and contact specific employees of a company of interest. Resource Development T1584.004 Acquire Infrastructure: Server Compromised servers were used by the Lazarus HTTP(S) backdoors and the downloader for C&C. T1585.001 Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts Lazarus attackers created a fake LinkedIn identity of a headhunter from Meta. T1585.003 Establish Accounts: Cloud Accounts Lazarus attackers had to create an account on a third-party cloud storage in order to deliver the initial ISO images. T1587.001 Develop Capabilities: Malware Custom tools from the attack are likely developed by the attackers. Some exhibit highly specific kernel development capacities seen earlier in Lazarus tools. T1608.001 Stage Capabilities: Upload Malware Lazarus attackers uploaded the initial ISO images to a cloud storage. Initial Access T1566.002 Phishing: Spearphishing Link The target received a link to a third-party remote storage with malicious ISO images. T1566.003 Phishing: Spearphishing via Service The target was contacted via LinkedIn Messaging. Execution T1106 Native API Windows APIs are essential for miniBlindingCan and LightlessCan to function and are resolved dynamically at runtime. T1053 Scheduled Task/Job Based on the parent process, a scheduled task was probably created to trigger thesimple chain of the LightlessCan execution. T1129 Shared Modules NickelLoader can load and execute an arbitrary DLL within memory. T1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File Lazarus attackers relied on the execution of Quiz1.exe and Quiz2.exe from the ISO files. T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation One of the LightlessCan commands allows creation of a new process via WMI. Persistence T1053 Scheduled Task/Job Based on the parent process, a scheduled task was probably created to trigger the simple chain of the LightlessCan execution. Moreover, LightlessCan can mimic the schtasks command. Defense Evasion T1134.002 Access Token Manipulation: Create Process with Token LightlessCan can create a new process in the security context of the user represented by the specified token and collect the output. T1622 Debugger Evasion There’s an anti-debug check in the dropper of miniBlindingCan. T1480 Execution Guardrails There’s a parent process check in the miniBlindingCan dropper. The concatenation of the values is required for decryption of the encrypted LightlessCan from the file system. T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information Many of these Lazarus tools and configurations are encrypted on the file system, e.g., LightlessCan in grpedit.dat and its configuration in wlansvc.cpl. T1574.002 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading Many of the Lazarus droppers and loaders use a legitimate program for their loading. T1027.002 Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing Lazarus obfuscated several executables by VMProtect in this attack, e.g., colorui.dll T1027.007 Obfuscated Files or Information: Dynamic API Resolution Both LightlessCan and miniBlindingCan resolve Windows APIs dynamically. T1027.009 Obfuscated Files or Information: Embedded Payloads The droppers of all malicious chains contain an embedded data array with an additional stage. T1562.003 Impair Defenses: Impair Command History Logging New features of LightlessCan mimic the most useful Windows command line utilities, to avoid executing the original console utilities. T1562.004 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall LightlessCan can mimic the netsh command and interact with firewall rules. T1070.004 Indicator Removal: File Deletion LightlessCan has the ability to delete files securely. T1070.006 Indicator Removal: Timestomp LightlessCan can alter the modification timestamps of files. T1202 Indirect Command Execution LightlessCan bypasses command execution by implementing their functionality. T1055 Process Injection LightlessCan and miniBlindingCan use various types of process injection. T1497.003 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion The miniBlindingCan dropper has an intentional initial execution delay. T1620 Reflective Code Loading Most of the droppers use reflective DLL injection. Discovery T1083 File and Directory Discovery LightlessCan can locate a file by its name. T1135 Network Share Discovery LightlessCan can mimic the net share command. T1057 Process Discovery LightlessCan identifies processes by name. T1012 Query Registry LightlessCan queries the registry for various system information it uses for encryption. T1018 Remote System Discovery LightlessCan can mimic the net view command. T1016 System Network Configuration Discovery LightlessCan can mimic the arp and ipconfig commands. T1049 System Network Connections Discovery LightlessCan can mimic the netstat command. T1007 System Service Discovery LightlessCan can mimic the sc query and tasklist commands. Command and Control T1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols NickelLoader, LightlessCan, and miniBlindingCan use HTTP and HTTPS for C&C. T1573.001 Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography LightlessCan and miniBlindingCan encrypt C&C traffic using the AES-128 algorithm. T1132.001 Data Encoding: Standard Encoding LightlessCan and miniBlindingCan encode C&C traffic using base64. Exfiltration T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel LightlessCan can exfiltrate data to its C&C server.

Apple gives you a warning about opening a downloaded project, but you’re almost certain to ignore that, if you think it’s a take-home.I assume that taking online ones would ask for hairy access, as well.Also, the people going for these would probably have pretty damn good access to the corporate Crown Jewels.Of course, no one would use corporate resources for job-hunting, right? I know that folks here, get all huffy, when I suggest that happens rather frequently. reply jetti 6 hours agoparent>Of course, no one would use corporate resources for job-hunting, right? I know that folks here, get all huffy, when I suggest that happens rather frequently. Where I work we have a take home exercise we have candidates do and then when we have the interview with that person we review their code with them and ask them to make incremental changes to see how they handle the asks with their communication skills and their technical ability. I interviewed one individual who couldn’t even get the REPL started for their project and as they were struggling trying to get it to work I heard them mumble to themself “I should have just use my work computer”. The fact they couldn’t get the most basic aspect of the project to work on their personal meant that they did their coding assignment on their work computer reply beebeepka 3 hours agorootparentInteresting. What makes work provided computers better suited for coding?Me, I don&#x27;t recall using company hardware for anything even remotely personal in many years. It&#x27;s stupid because they are loaded with all kinds of spyware. reply mr_mitm 2 hours agorootparentWhen you spend eight hours coding on your work computer, you make lots of little tweaks to improve workflow. If you then do nearly no coding on your home computer, it&#x27;s unlikely that you will perform the same tweaks. I try to keep my systems set up almost identically, but that&#x27;s a lot of work. (I now try to use ansible for that but after playing around for a bit I&#x27;m having doubts if it was the right choice. Keeping everything in sync is not exactly ergonomic.)Some particular quirk of autocompletion could become almost pure muscle memory, and if it&#x27;s suddenly missing, you notice. reply turboponyy 1 hour agorootparentIt sounds like you&#x27;d benefit a lot from Nix&#x2F;NixOS [1], if not just home-manager[2].1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nix-community&#x2F;home-manager reply metabeard 2 hours agorootparentprevAnecdotal comment: Check out Chezmoi. Its worked really well for me. reply mr_mitm 1 hour agorootparentThanks, I never heard of it before and it looks really interesting.However, it seems that it does not cover all of my needs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;twpayne&#x2F;chezmoi&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;1510#discussi...Maybe I should use Ansible for system-wide configuration and chezmoi for dotfiles in $HOME. reply bakuninsbart 59 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been in almost exactly this situation, although the issue was rather that I have a Linux tower without camera&#x2F;microphone and a Windows laptop for playing some games or doing Microsoft &#x2F; office stuff. Setting it up to anything resembling my real dev experience is probably a day or two of work, and the first time I used it for a job interview I probably seemed less than competent... I also have a work MacBook, but so far haven&#x27;t used it for applying to other jobs, that would be kinda weird. reply jrumbut 3 hours agorootparentprevJust that it&#x27;s set up in a particular way, I suspect. A long running project&#x2F;organization will accrete plenty of tools, scripts, configurations, etc that make their environment different than another using a similar stack. reply msh 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you don&#x27;t really code in your spare time your home computer might be unsuitable. For example a Chromebook reply jasonwatkinspdx 3 hours agorootparentprev> Interesting. What makes work provided computers better suited for coding?Some people only know how to code within the environment managed by their corporation. This is increasingly the case with folks that have only worked at Kubernetes shops. reply otteromkram 13 minutes agorootparentWhy did you feel the need to quote the parent comment? Especially for just a short statement.Just curious.Is it because you forget what you were going to respond to while writing it out?Now, before you get too offended, try imagining reading things as though a normal conversation is occurring.Users who \"think they&#x27;re helping\" by adding quotes aren&#x27;t because it&#x27;s just repetitive fluff and becomes frustrating when it grows into quotation city.If you need to quote the majority of a comment, why not try clarifying your response, instead? reply Grimburger 5 hours agoparentprev> no one would use corporate resources for job-huntingMorally grey(pale blue?) aside, I&#x27;ve been given entire days at work to look for new jobs as part of a redundancy agreement, it was widely supported by management. reply macintux 8 hours agoparentprevAt my first IT job, I spotted some bounce messages from a jobs address at a local big pharma firm. Admittedly, personal email addresses weren’t as common in 1996 as they are now, but still, rookie mistake.I’ve maintained a strict “don’t do anything personal on a corporate computer” policy for a long time, but I’ve not found that to be a common approach. reply ryandrake 7 hours agorootparentSame here. Air gap your personal and professional life. Separate devices, separate networks (if you work from home), don’t even bring your personal device to work if you don’t really have to.There was a story a few years back making the rounds on HN where an Apple employee had to turn in her corporate device due to some lawsuit against the company. This happens all the time in big companies. She was outraged at this because she had personal nudes on her corporate device. WTF how could anyone think this was a good idea? reply WWLink 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t work for Apple or (honestly) know anyone that does, but from at least one news article, I get the impression Apple openly encourages (and maybe even requires) it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;22648265&#x2F;apple-employee-privacy-icl... reply steelframe 5 hours agorootparent> I get the impression Apple openly encourages (and maybe even requires) it.When I worked at Apple I needed a personal iCloud account to set up my corp MacBook. I simply created a new dummy personal account just for that. Nobody&#x27;s auditing your iCloud account to make sure it&#x27;s your \"real\" personal account or anything. reply otteromkram 8 minutes agorootparentWhy did you feel the need to quote the parent comment? Especially when it&#x27;s so short? Honest question.Anyone reading the thread will be equipped with the context needed to understand your statement sans quote. Funny as that sounds. reply xmodem 1 hour agorootparentprevAt my last job I used a dummy iCloud account at the system level, but you can log into a separate account for the app store, which was necessary to avoid having to re-buy some apps I depend on.Just as I was leaving they were in the process of replacing everyone&#x27;s computer with new ones that were much more locked down. reply emodendroket 2 hours agorootparentprevI have a “work personal” Google account for Chrome for similar reasons. reply raverbashing 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah about that. That&#x27;s one of the biggest weirdness in related to Macbooks on a corp environment, why do I need an unrelated account to do basic stuff on an Apple machine reply oli-g 1 hour agorootparentprev> I get the impression Apple openly encourages (and maybe even requires) it.To take nudes? reply upon_drumhead 4 hours agorootparentprevApple encourages it, however, it&#x27;s not required.Meta requires you to link your personal meta account with your work identity. reply packetslave 2 hours agorootparentMeta requires you to link a personal account to your work identity. Similar to Apple, they don&#x27;t check to see if it was created just for the purpose. reply Scoundreller 4 hours agorootparentprev> There was a story a few years back making the rounds on HN where an Apple employee had to turn in her corporate device due to some lawsuit against the company.Smarter decision is for the corp to just buy your device for you. Then it&#x27;s a personal device, and at least in some cases I&#x27;m aware of, not a government record at least.Very doable for a phone where your \"work\" is limited to messages, webmail and calls. reply MandieD 2 hours agorootparentprevMy advice to young colleagues: never do anything on a work computer that you wouldn’t mind your boss (or her boss) seeing.Being greeted with a Department of Defense splash screen before login reminding me that everything I did on that computer was subject to monitoring formed that habit early, and I still can’t shake it, no matter how long I work in Germany, for a German firm with a rather assertive works council. reply namdnay 2 hours agoparentprevPersonally I gave up having my own computer about 10 years ago. Probably not the “safest” strategy, but I always found it a bit wasteful to buy a second device. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentI have worked in companies where that would be a reason to cease contract. reply ahoka 1 hour agoparentprevWe had someone submit their current employers code as a solution to the assignment. It had the company’s name all over in namspaces, etc. It was also not what we asked for, but something only slightly related. Their employer was making medical devices. reply saagarjha 8 hours agoparentprevApple added sandboxed shell scripts recently, I assume as part of an effort to make builds a little more hermetic. While I’m sure it’s not a perfect solution I feel like it would be nice to open a project in a mode where all build steps run in a sandbox. Obviously when something fails you can take a look at what it was trying to do :) reply emodendroket 2 hours agoparentprevSeems like a silly, unnecessary risk but it seems like more and more people don’t even have their own laptop. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentIn many companies using work laptops for private stuff is considered a security issue and a breach of work contract, not everyone actively checks it, it is however an easy way to fire someone when something like this happens. reply Aqua_Geek 8 hours agoparentprevWhenever I grade take-home assignments, the first thing I do is open the Xcode project file in vim and look for shady stuff. Admittedly, I don’t think most of my colleagues do the same due diligence. reply 3seashells 1 hour agoparentprevEverything cooperate devices touch the own, so if you hunt for a job on company property you become a consultant in your next job leased out by your current one. u&#x2F;s@ reply quickthrower2 5 hours agoparentprevDownload an .exe, but via an appeal to greed and flattery, and implied trust ofa FAANG.The solution might be to do real work in VMs while the laptop is a dumb terminal then lock it the fuck down (no downloads!) reply clnq 8 hours agoprevI’m always surprised people do take home tests, email headhunters, call and interview with other companies on their current company’s hardware. Plenty told me they do it, but I just can’t comprehend it.There are so many potential consequences. An eager beaver manager once talked a future employer out of employing me through a personal connection, and that was just because they found out. Even if it was unethical or illegal, these things happen, and even in large tech companies. Imagine willingly sharing all details of your job hunts with your employer… maybe it’s just me, but the thought feels wrong.Work and personal matters should be church and state, right? reply phyzome 7 hours agoparentI find it pretty disturbing how many of my coworkers don&#x27;t even have a personal computer -- they just use their work laptop for everything. Mind-boggling. (These are software developers, they can damn well afford a laptop.)The most I mix it is using my smaller, lighter, Bluetooth-supporting work laptop for watching innocuous YouTube videos while doing dishes. And I used to use it to print stuff at the office, on occasion. reply bagels 5 hours agorootparentYeah, it&#x27;s a good way to get your personal things brought in to discovery, snooped on by corporate security, or erased when you suddenly get laid off. reply ironmagma 3 hours agorootparentprev> These are software developers, they can damn well afford a laptop.Not necessarily. On the one level, you don&#x27;t know their salaries (as they might have negotiated badly or simply be underpaid), and then additionally they might pay a lot for housing, child support, debt, medicine, or other invisible expenses. Living in a place like San Francisco it can quickly add up. reply pjot 7 hours agoparentprevJust as a matter of CYA, use a phone&#x2F;tablet for interviews if you must. Why add the unnecessary risk?Maybe people like the rush… reply emodendroket 2 hours agorootparentDevelopment is one of the worst cases for a tablet though. Almost any other task works better. reply phendrenad2 8 hours agoprevSo they sent .exe files to the victim, under the pretext that the victim was supposed to duplicate their functionality in C++? Receiving an .exe file from someone should be a dead giveaway that this is an attack, or at least, that the person sending it to you is incredibly technically incompetent. But then again, I lived through the Windows 95 era. I suppose some lessons have to be re-learned with every new generation. reply jeroenhd 53 minutes agoparentYou only need to succeed once against a company full of people if your job offer is enticing enough. We don&#x27;t know how many people said \"never mind\" when asked to do weird tests.The stupid thing is that that it&#x27;s remarkably easy to sandbox and application these days. Sandboxie is free, though not guaranteed to work (but it may very well have done, or at least would have made the strange behaviour obvious) and Windows Pro has had a right-click menu option to run an executable in a sandbox for a while.When I read the title, I initially thought it was about infection through IDE (\"do you trust the authors of this project\" is there for a very good reason and in the case of VS Code attackers can get code execution before the prompt through Git config trickery).I&#x27;d be wary of executing a program, but I bet I would click the \"sure enable code execution\" button if a recruiter sent me a coding challenge in the form of an incomplete project with a Git repo. Especially if they could set up a remote interview process where they want to go through code live \"to see how I approach problems\".Right nowt he attack is super basic, but it&#x27;s not hard to make the initial infection harder to detect in time. reply mlhpdx 6 hours agoparentprevAt first I thought this was more clever than it was. Taking people into running downloaded or attached exe files is simple and apparently still effective.But what would be even more wicked, and effective would be pointing them to a GitHub repo with the “challenge” project to complete, and referencing a compromised package that does their bidding as the victim tests their solution. reply hahn-kev 1 hour agorootparentYeah I was thinking about that. Even asking me to use a specific package for any reason, I probably wouldn&#x27;t think much of that before today. However now I&#x27;d certainly question it. reply userbinator 7 hours agoparentprevKnowing what they were trying to do actually makes me wish I were the one they were trying to trick. I know these aren&#x27;t regular lame script kiddies, but I wonder how they&#x27;d react to an attempted counter-offensive.Give me an .exe and ask me to run it, and I&#x27;ll open it in a hex editor for inspection instead. If what you claim is a \"hello world\" or Fibonacci generator is much bigger than I&#x27;d expect (a few KBs) and contains encrypted-looking data or other attempts at obfuscation, I&#x27;m not running it. reply raverbashing 3 hours agorootparentOr at least run it in a VM reply sixstringtheory 2 hours agoparentprevI’ve suggested binary distribution as part of a black box exercise in the past. Locking down the source and being able to change details for each candidate would mean solutions posted online would not help. reply otteromkram 0 minutes agorootparentBecause cameras don&#x27;t exist, right?Unless you&#x27;re crafting some revolutionary problem for each candidate, changing details won&#x27;t matter much. reply neilv 4 hours agoprevWhen I was consulting on some government programs, I consciously kept my resume off the Internet.I didn&#x27;t have access to anything useful to spies, but some of the keywords might look to someone like I did. Like how some recruiters seem to spam all keyword search hits on LinkedIn.I knew I&#x27;d have to report any kind of security incident, and I thought that might interrupt my contracts and income, while a cautious bureaucracy processes the incident.

ERIC GAILLARD/REUTERS 43 COMMENTS SHARE BOOKMARK LISTEN TO ARTICLE Google’s search engine is covered by federal privacy law, a court has ruled, opening the door for people to demand to have their names made unsearchable – commonly known as a “right to be forgotten.” In a 2-1 ruling, the Federal Court of Appeal said Google, which is responsible for as much as 75 per cent of internet searches in Canada, is not covered by an exemption in the federal law for journalistic or artistic work. “Google Search does not collect, use, or disclose personal information for a journalistic purpose and, even if it does, it does not do so solely for that purpose,” Justice John Laskin wrote for the majority. The case began with a complaint to the federal Privacy Commissioner in 2017 from a man whose name and details are kept confidential in the ruling. The man said outdated and inaccurate information about him in newspaper articles found on the internet was leading to great personal harm, including physical assault, employment discrimination, severe social stigma and persistent fear. He wanted the information to be delisted – made unsearchable, unless someone knew the website urls featuring his name. Ultimately, the Privacy Commissioner asked the Federal Court to rule on its jurisdiction to address the complaint under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. Supreme Court rejects deportation of non-citizens accused – but not convicted – of violent acts Google argued that it acted as an intermediary between publishers and their audience, much as libraries or convenience stores do. It said that to exclude intermediaries would make the exemption for journalism ineffective. And media organizations, including The Globe and Mail, the CBC, CTV, Torstar, the Postmedia Network, Rogers Media Inc. and La Presse Inc., intervened to argue that Google plays an important role in disseminating news. Justice Wyman Webb, who dissented in the ruling, agreed that Google is no different than a convenience store operator who sells newspapers, or a broadcaster who uses newspapers as a source of information. “Google’s stated mission,” he wrote, “is ‘to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible.’ Google’s purpose in collecting the information found in the newspaper articles is to index this information so that it can be easily found by an individual using the Google search engine. Its only purpose in collecting the information is to make it more accessible.” Lawyers for the complainant praised the court’s ruling. “I think it’s a vindication of privacy regulations,” said Mark Phillips, co-counsel with Michael Fenrick. “Canada’s federal private-sector privacy legislation was put in place to protect individuals against new types of technological privacy threats of exactly the kind we’re seeing here.” Valerie Lawton, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, said it is pleased the court agreed with its position that Google’s search engine service is subject to federal privacy law. “This brings welcome clarification to this area of the law.” The case appears likely to be headed for the Supreme Court of Canada. A lawyer representing the media coalition said late Friday afternoon he was not yet authorized to comment, as did a lawyer for Google. Criminal cases in Ontario on verge of collapse owing to courthouse chaos The ruling authorizes the Privacy Commissioner to review the complaint to determine whether it should recommend to Google that the complainant’s name be delisted from the search engine. Two years ago, a Federal Court judge ruled on a definition of journalism developed by the Canadian Association of Journalists in ruling that Google’s search engine is not used solely for a journalistic purpose. The definition included informing the community on issues the community values, an element of original production, and discipline intended to provide accuracy and fairness. In Friday’s ruling, Justice Laskin wrote that while other definitions are possible, what matters is what Google does: “Google displays responses to a user search query ranked in the order that Google considers of most relevance to the user, as determined by algorithms maintained by Google. That is the purpose of Google Search. In carrying out that purpose, Google is agnostic as to the nature of that content: nothing turns on whether or not it is journalistic, let alone on whether it meets certain aspirational standards of journalism. “Even if the search happens to return snippets that contain links to journalistic content, that cannot be said to be its purpose when Google is indifferent to whether or not it does so. At a minimum, that cannot be said to be its sole purpose.” He also said the questions before the court were more limited than the right to be forgotten. The constitutional protection of freedom of speech did not figure into the court’s analysis. Justice Laskin said “Charter values” are in play only where a statute has more than one plausible meaning. Mr. Fenrick, the complainant’s co-counsel, said laws exist in Europe and in Quebec to allow people to press for their names to be delisted, and require privacy and autonomy to be balanced against the public’s right to know. “We’re not arguing and no one has argued in any jurisdiction that people should have an automatic right to this,” he said. “It’s always been interpreted as a case-by-case balancing between the public’s right to know and privacy.” Sign up for the Morning Update Newsletter Start your day with news briefs on the day’s most important stories as selected by and written by Globe editors.

Wild. Thank god for the first amendment. reply icegreentea2 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been trying to follow this case, and I&#x27;d love for someone with actual legal background to correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. But as far I can tell from reading the rulings and PIPEDA is that technically all the courts have said so far is that commercial search engines are not blanket exempt from PIPEDA, and that they are not exempt from PIPEDA in the context of the original complaint (the actual guy complaining that his name is giving untrue and damaging results on google).Google has been trying to argue that the Privacy Commissioner needs to consider charter implications of PIPEDA applying (and allowing right to be forgotten), while the Commissioner and the courts have been stating that they will first rule on if google search engine results are in scope of PIPEDA before considering if delisting would unduly limit Charter rights.Finally, as I understand it, PIPEDA effectively grants the Privacy Commissioner investigatory powers, and that enforcement and remedies are supposed to be enforced by courts (ie, another lawsuit). That said, the Privacy Commissioner has published a draft position on online reputation that says it does believe that delisting&#x2F;deindexing can sometimes be an appropriate remedy, so the obvious follow up steps would be the Privacy Comissioner&#x2F;original complaint proceeding.In other words, even if Google fails to win an appeal on this set of rulings, there will almost certainly be another round of court cases on if delisting (\"right to be forgotten\") is actually Charter compliant. reply kranke155 15 hours agoprevIn Europe this has been used by a lot of shady characters, including a drug dealing diplomatic visa buying individual in my country, to remove all mentions of whatever they can on Google.

But criminals in particular used to escape this bubble of knowledge about who they were, by simply leaving town and starting over somewhere else.

No system is going to be perfect (you&#x27;d need an infinite amount of resources) so you need to design failure methods into it. The same is true about laws. In fact, I&#x27;d say that this is a big reasons \"laws are meant to be broken\" because the ecosystem is always changing and intent and implementation don&#x27;t always align. Sometimes laws that seem very good are incredibly stupid in certain situations. This is why we should never rule by the letter of the law alone. There&#x27;s a famous philosopher who came up with the (namesake) \"Blackstone&#x27;s Ratio\". In short \"It is better that a ten guilty men go free than a innocent man be stricken of his freedom.\" Blackstone influenced many of the early founders for countries in the Americas.So we have to ask ourselves, is this a thing that is beneficial to normal people. Is their right to be forgotten and their privacy important? You know people will always abuse this system, but is it better existing than if it hadn&#x27;t? You will __always__ be able to point to abusers with __any__ system, so the truth is pointing at abusers itself isn&#x27;t an argument against something. It needs more context. If the system is only used by abusers, then this is a problem. But terrorists and pedos use encryption (the common fingers being pointed) but so do normal people and it is highly valuable to normal people and their daily lives. Idk if removing your identity from Google is as important as that, but we should make sure we include more context than saying \"people abuse it.\" That&#x27;s a statement that will always be true. reply Sunspark 18 hours agoprevIf someone has the same name as someone who committed an offence that&#x27;s a problem right?This permanent memory doesn&#x27;t extend to yourself only, it covers OTHER PEOPLE who have the same name as you.

Clearly in that case, she dodged a bullet.But you hear about people having to explain drug possession charges, or even robbery charges from their past when they were a different person. We pretend like we actually want the judicial system to at least sometimes “fix” people but we make it next to impossible to do that. We assign a “price” to pay back to society, and the whole point is that price is supposed to be concrete and understandable.The line is hard to draw between crimes where “society agrees you’ve ruined your life” (child molestation) and “society wants you to get better”. (drug possession, I hope?)Maybe I’m more so vouching for “public awareness” to be a part of the sentencing procedure? (Allowing crimes without that punishment minimum to be forgotten on public platforms like Google.)We already have laws&#x2F;precedence that make the distinction between degrees of homicide for example. So the fuzzy line problem is already kind of solved in that sense? We’ve being doing that sort of difficult sorting for other punishments for many centuries.

Criminal records would be a clear grey area where one could make the case for a public interest particularly in the short term, which is less strong over time. But inaccurate reporting is clearly much less eligible for the public interest.I think phrasing it as a right is perhaps sets the wrong framing, as it’s quite conditional. (Certainly seems to trigger many Americans.) reply xoa 20 hours agoprevA \"right\" to destroy other people&#x27;s memories, and that it unironically goes under the shockingly Orwellian new speak \"right to be forgotten\", is one of the more horrifying recent things to see both spread and actually get embraced by so-called defenders of the people. There is no parallel in history. People absolutely can be naturally forgotten, but the principle that there is a right to have others forget naturally leads down a very, very ugly path. What people think about us and remember about us is NOT our data, it&#x27;s theirs even if it&#x27;s about us. If someone is spreading something factually and materially wrong there are already a myriad of tools to correct that.Edit: I think honesty and HN spirit compels me to steelman against my own argument as well. An argument can be made that there was a time when it was possible for someone willing to take some serious risk, cost, and effort to start anew from even a really bad past. Step back a century or two or earlier, and identities and persistent records could be pretty scattered. Somebody who did something pretty bad (but maybe not truly notorious) and served any time but was determined to reform could leave it all behind and travel a thousand miles away with a new name and build a new life (or die trying). The space for that has undoubtedly shrunken in some respects, and looks like it may continue to do so. I can accept that there can be reasonable differences of opinion on that.But against that is what it means to force it to happen. What such powerful legal tools will do when, with total inevitability, they are most effectively wielded by the most powerful as such tools always are. The people who already face the least accountability in many ways also tend to be the ones most able to make use of anything that may give them even a colorable case against critics and detractors. Some people truly reform, but of course some do not. And of course there are the principles involved. Is this something to use force over, because make no mistake, that&#x27;s what it means to make something a right backed by law. That&#x27;s what the very nature of \"law\" is, it&#x27;s formalized opinions backed by power. The push for this new \"right\" feels different and dangerous to me then mere basic privacy, or worries about government (or even megacorp) surveillance. reply officialchicken 20 hours agoparentDespite the hand-wavy arguments and use of misinterpreted shock phrases like \"Orwellian\", a persons&#x27; memories (and biochemical retention mechanisms) are not the same as a computers.

What about those with memory problems who depend on such external memories?>the former has a singular lifetime and there can only one instance - zero copies.That&#x27;s curious, I could have sworn humans had developed ways to share their memories with each other through things like \"words\" or \"pictures\"?

So you&#x27;re \"only\" talking about censoring&#x2F;destroying conversation, phone calls, letters, messages, newspapers, paintings and such?There is no shock phrasing here, despite you wanting to deflect. To forget is to lose memories. A right to have others forget necessarily implies actively forcing them to destroy their own memories. That&#x27;s what it means, stripped of the misdirection. It&#x27;s evil.

What about if it&#x27;s a newspaper, can they index it or make copies? A single journalist? Researcher? What does \"newspaper\", \"journalist\", or \"researcher\" even mean as a matter of law? Are only certain elites allowed now? And on and on.You shouldn&#x27;t argue for a big new expansion of government force restricting information over and above defamation law without really being able to think all this through IMO. Details really matter. Imagine the absolute worst populist wannabe dictators at not merely national scale but at the local small town scale that doesn&#x27;t get much attention but has real power to affect people&#x27;s lives. What are they going to do with this? Does it matter if they&#x27;d lose a 6-figure lawsuit in the end if no one they would go after can afford to fight it? That&#x27;s not a theoretical threat. Anti-SLAPP laws help a lot by making things much cheaper thanks to a fairly straight forward (under defamation law) low pass filter. A judge can determine pretty easily if there is a colorable case or not. As the linked article says, \"right to be forgotten\" is complex and case-by-case, ie, expensive. And we know that \"expensive lawsuit\" means \"bullies will use this for illegitimate ends\", so we should be very cautious about opening up mass applicable complex new forms of action without really thinking it through. reply Turing_Machine 19 hours agorootparent> Why?

The right to be forgotten is a very direct an unarguable violation of this. It isn&#x27;t even debatable, and thus we are left debating free speech issues of which Europeans and Americans have very strong differences (in my opinion, anyone who is under an authoritarian government doesn&#x27;t get to participate in the debate for censorship.)I don&#x27;t know what is worse - that, for example, a Norweigen neo-Nazi mass murderer who will only serve 20 years in prison could erase the stories about them and that event ever occuring, or that someone who did something really dumb in college could usurp and override everyone else&#x27;s right to free speech.The right to be forgotten rests on the premise that someone can be \"reformed\" and that their right to erase the past outweighs the rights of everyone else. The basic premise is someone did something really bad or embarrassing and they are too lazy to change their name (I have friends who have done that, due to an embarrassing newspaper article appearing Google.)I think we are headed toward a bifurcated interest. The reason that countries outside of the US have been able to compel American tech companies to do their bidding, to date, is because these companies are monopolies that generate massive amounts of cashflow doing things which are not impacted by that law (right to be forgotten does almost 0 to Google&#x27;s income.)How is this going to work with LLM models?

Which is the reason why one comes to a forum and not to a private journal. As there is no formal analytics system, getting feedback (button presses, replies, etc.) is the only way to know you are contributing something that a larger community is taking in. And such feedback is what encourages contributing more.If there was something that the community doesn&#x27;t like, naturally they would hide the fact that a community exist.

Most of the newspapers in Canada are owned by one company and newsrooms have been consolidated and shrunk. I used to read my city&#x27;s two major newspapers - they&#x27;d report a different subset of what was happening, and where they reported on the same thing the stories and takes would be different. Both were biased, but biased in different directions, so I felt that I was getting a semi-balanced view by reading both. Now both papers are owned by the same company, have the same reporters, same editors, report on the same things, and run identical stories. There&#x27;s no balanced view and not enough reporters to follow up on every little thing that gets reported.Ideally searching for this person&#x27;s name would show the newest stories first (\"person acquitted of crime\", \"charges dropped\", etc), but if those stories never get written they will never show up in a search engine. And very few people will dig into CanLII to find the outcome, if it even makes it far enough to get into CanLII.I don&#x27;t know what the solution is.

    "originBody": "´´ Home About this Blog Contact Recommended Reading About Me Performance Thursday, August 4, 2022 The Tron Project: How Japan Almost Ruled IT At a winter day in 1989 the Japanese sent chills down the spine of the world of tech. They presented a house, located in one of Tokyo’s most fashionable neighbourhood, which was able to think, sense and act on its own. It linked millions of microprocessors in consumer appliances, business machines and telecommunication networks into a giant cooperative web. The house would know when to open the windows, air-condition the room and water the plants. It would flush the toilet, flip the faucet and air-dry your hands. When the phone rang, it muted the stereo. If the homeowner wanted to cook a fancy meal, it would present a recipe and instruction on a kitchen monitor while setting the correct oven temperature. All without manual human interaction. The Japanese did it again. With this first “smart house”, the Japanese called it the Tron House, they put the Rest of the World in their place when it comes to creativity and innovation in the field of tech. Although, some less visionary tech consultants, like Gib Hoxie, weren’t impressed at all, commenting that: “The TRON house looks to me like an electronic whiz kid’s dream. (…) consumers are already disgruntled with digital videocassette recorders and microwave ovens. They find dials easier to use and are moving toward them again. (…) TRON isn’t addressing that at all. They say, ‘Let’s pull all of this together in a universal digital interface.’ That’s a nightmare to me. It means I can’t run anything in my house (…). Tron will be of no lasting significance” More visionary tech gurus, like Bill Gates, certainly did not subscribe to Hoxies’ analysis. They had been following the “Tron Project” vigilantly for some time. And what they saw was not to their liking. Tron stands for “The Real-time Operating system Nucleus”. It was developed in the early 1980s by Ken Sakamura, a visionary associate professor of information science at the Tokyo University. Basically, Tron was a Japanese computing standard (operating system) for almost anything. From personal computers, to robots and mainframes. In the sphere of personal computers, the Tron Project already stunned experts in the mid-1980s, when the Japanese electronics giant Matsushita introduced a BTRON PC. A personal computer with unprecedented capabilities. Although running on an Intel 80286 chip with a meagre 8 MHz and 2 MB of memory, it was able to display a moving video in colour on a separate window. More importantly, and nerve wrecking for Bill Gates, BTRON was intended to be offered as an open architecture. All the hardware and software would have been publicly available at the cost of an annual membership fee to the TRON Association. Ranging from about $23,000 a year down to a modest $4,600. Microsoft feared that a TRON PC would end the dominant position of NEC Corp. within Japan, which was offering a highly popular computer that used Microsoft’s MS-Dos system. The time Japan was pushing the “Tron Project” were marked by severe economic tension with the U.S. Overwhelmed by stunning innovations, superior quality, and low prices of a great many of imported Japanese products, U.S. companies were losing market share at home and globally at a frightening pace. U.S. foreign trade was essentially bankrupt. And the American workers were furious at Japan Inc., smashing publicly Japanese cars and stereo equipment. To the Japanese, the BTRON PC and the Tron house offered an intriguing glimpse what the future might hold. To the Americans, under the climate of trade friction, it was considered an economic threat. The straw that broke the camel’s back was the Japanese Education Ministry planning to introduce Tron computers to all of the country’s schools. Now Apple, who had the largest share of the school computer market in the U.S. was fuming. It feared being shut out of the highly profitable market for educational computer systems in Japan. It was high time for lobbying in Washington. In 1989 the U.S. software industry group, ADAPSO, concluded in a report on Japanese software that TRON had “strong undertones of nationalism and will have the practical effect of impeding foreign penetration of the Japanese market.” The U.S. government objected against the Japanese school project. It called the initiative “actual and potential market intervention”. U.S. trade officials feared that the Japanese mandate for Tron in the education system subsequently would lead to a de facto Tron standard in the business and other markets and threatened the move with sanctions. Japan Inc. eagerly took to the message of the U.S administration, as Japanese broadcasters were incessantly airing furious American blue color workers sledgehammering Japanese TV sets and cars. It made the Japanese government and corporate leaders shake in their boots, fearing restricted access to their most important export market. Finally, Japan offered U.S. officials the olive branch of Tron in order to calm things down. The government quickly abandoned the school plan, and nearly all Japanese companies involved in BTRON-related activities canceled their projects. The Tron project was history. Today’s standard of computing systems in the world is Microsoft’s Windows, which has been enjoying a monopoly for over two decades by now. Although, Japan was literally 10 years ahead of Microsoft, developing a competitive OS already in the 1980s, BTRON never had a fighting chance. Not only was Tron barred from being promoted in the United States, but also dropped like a hot potato by Japan Inc. (with a little encouragement by Bill Gates). It is hard to imagine Microsoft not having stifled TRON as an OS for general users anyway. Still it is a shame that the Japanese government had no strategy and corporate Japan was such a coward. If they had envisioned the future rise of information technology correctly, they would have known about the superiority and importance of their software. They would have guarded the TRON project with all their might. With abandoning the Tron project Japan missed out on being a global authority in IT.

First, both involve the world&#x27;s largest and second-largest economies; second, China is the country with the largest trade surplus with the U.S., the spot was held by Japan during the 1980s; third, China is highly dependent on the U.S. market, so was Japan. The U.S. approach and the intensity of the trade wars are also more or less the same. reply throwaway4good 1 hour agoparentI don&#x27;t think the tech war is the full explanation for the decline of Japanese tech; the failure to focus on software is a big one and seems to be due to internal factors such as conservatism and business models tied to sale of hardware.However when the US combines it industrial interests with its state apparatus it is a formidable force; media described the Japanese society as authoritarian, bitter and racist - eager to get back the Americans after world war 2 - with the everyday Japanese being mindless warrior drones in a strict hierarchy. (For examples of this sentiment see the movies Black Rain or Rising Sun - or lookup the tragic death of Vincent Chin - a Chinese mistaken for being Japanese).The US justice system ran a series of entrapment campaign targeting Japanese firms. And there was buy-american campaigns and extra tariffs were put on Japanese imports.Ultimately the Japanese yielded. The plaza accord fixed the Yen at a very high price point hampering Japanese exports. And quotas were set for US exports to Japan and Japanese car factories were setup in the US.And then in 90es you had the rise of now competitative tech firms from South Korea and Taiwan. reply FirmwareBurner 50 minutes agorootparent>the failure to focus on software is a big one and seems to be due to internal factors such as conservatism and business models tied to sale of hardware.It&#x27;s the same in Germany.

When I lived in Germany 5-10 years ago, this issue was regularly discussed in the media. Some companies do try to adapt. E.g. Bosch traditionally delivered a lot of diesel-related tech, but they are also investing a lot in batteries and fuel cells. E.g. a large number of eBikes in Europe (probably a large majority even) use Bosch motors and batteries.Only time will tell if it&#x27;s enough. Of course, companies will try to stretch the transition as much as possible so that they&#x27;ll have time to catch up. reply Barrin92 7 hours agoparentprevAnother article that shows the similarities in mindset from the time is this one from 1987, it&#x27;s quite funny how similar it reads to stuff published today.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;money.cnn.com&#x2F;magazines&#x2F;fortune&#x2F;fortune_archive&#x2F;1987... reply seeraan 7 hours agorootparentThis is interesting and.. quite different in one very important key way:\"Are the Japanese picking our brains?&#x27;&#x27; a congressional staffer asks. &#x27;&#x27;Yes.

As in most countries, tech people in Japan are mostly males, and mostly are not very strong in the humanities and in social skills. This group tends to be extremely self-conscious about their limited English ability and generally avoids interaction with foreigners.For Korea, I see a trend, but I&#x27;m not confident about the explanation. I see lots of bright kids at university, see them get hired at big tech firms, and see them enthuse about their work over beers. I don&#x27;t see them interacting a lot with foreigners. My impression is there is so much going on within Korea that they don&#x27;t feel strongly motivated to look outside. reply fomine3 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true in general for Japan, but trained Japanese engineers who want a rsync-able cloud storage service are fine to register English web services.There are reasons I come up with: Little known in Japanese community; there are many people don&#x27;t watch English community even if they are fine to read English docs and send PR.

Not so much about Korea.My experience is that English in Japan isn’t really spoken outside of big tech firms and even there the quality isn’t great.I have tried organizing an event on the same topic in Japanese and in English, almost no one showed up in English but it was full in Japanese.They have their own alternatives to some services and stack overflow, qiita.The thing is that they don’t really need to speak English and for the cases they need English they bite a foreigner. reply manxman 2 hours agorootparentSo there’s clearly stuff being done to train a younger generation to speak English better than was the case previously.The problem is that even with that, the mindset still appears to preserve the notion of Japanese supremacy over everything irrespective of data to the contrary. So improvement isn’t happening.Take the Shinkansen as anotherq example. Impressive if you look at the train specs and reliability&#x2F;punctuality. What isn’t seen so readily is the manual process of booking seats at stations with limited options for booking online. That manual process is often so inefficient that you might as well travel by a slower train given the loss of time involved.Similar inefficiencies are observable throughout Japan. The people are typically oblivious because they are indoctrinated into following the process without questioning things. True of the younger English speakers as well from what I’ve seen. Not entirely sure if that’s blind deference, fear of conflict&#x2F;group judgement or the result of brainwashing into a collaboration over competition mindset. Maybe it’s a mix of all of the above.So I see very narrow examples of personal excellences where that obsession and perseverance doesn’t involve getting others on board. But innovation or improvement involving groups is more dysfunctional than anything I’ve seen elsewhere by a wide margin. reply throwaway2037 2 hours agorootparentYou can book Tokyo-Osaka Shinkansen tickets online now.

A high-level CPU doesn&#x27;t nessecarily have to add stuff, sometimes a high-level CPU does less because the tight integration with OS and language does more.If memory safety is enforced by your compiler, e.g by your OS only executing WASM, you can get rid of the MMU. [1]If you get rid of branch prediction and prefetching logic you get more space for more cores. If you hook up memory in parallel to those cores you get higher effective memory throughput and executed instructions per second.If you got rid of the mmu you can also use that space for accelerating database indexes. CPUs already contain trie walkers for their page tables, you might as well use that for looking up data in indexes directly.In the end highly parallel architectures won.

The big tech retailer there is \"BIC Camera\" which contrary to the name sells everything from Cameras to Macs&#x2F;PCs to drones and pretty much all consumer electronics. 20 years ago it had a bunch of interest stuff that wasn&#x27;t available in the west and was typically better constructed than the stuff we got.Now it&#x27;s way behind the curve. PCs and accessories that I&#x27;ve not seen in UK&#x2F;US stores for over a decade. Fax machines are still a thing and sold new.But outside of such curiosities, it&#x27;s interesting looking at where Japanese tech has sunk.The Japanese can&#x27;t bear to stock Samsung&#x2F;LG televisions for reasons of national prime one presumes. So there are a bunch of locally branded televisions that seem antiquated - a far cry from the era where Sony held the crown for top end displays.The PC vendors from Sony Vaio to Toshiba&#x2F;Dynabook are gone or diminished. The consumer electronics&#x2F;home electronics that once were interesting look increasingly dated given the Japanese obsession with putting lots of confusing buttons on their products instead of cleaning up the user experience (Japanese toilets are a great example of this... press the wrong button and get violated!)And of course the camera section of BIC Camera is perhaps the most interesting predictor of where Japan&#x27;s tech industry is headed. Sure the latest Canon, Nikon and Sony mirrorless cameras are amazing feats of engineering. The problem is that the cameras in phones have become so good that for 99% of the market, the camera in their phone is more than sufficient. So the Japanese camera vendors have become and will continue to will become increasingly niche. Of course the DJI drones next to the camera section offer capabilities the mirrorless variety can&#x27;t match. So even more of the Japanese core tech industry will get eaten by China.Pair all of the above with 260% debt to GDP (which is insanely insane even compared to the US&#x2F;Europe), a population demographic pyramid showing not just an aging population but one that&#x27;s rapidly declining and an economy that seems build on smoke and mirrors (go into any 7-Eleven and see unbelievably low prices for convenience groceries compared to any US&#x2F;European store). Such businesses are part of what I&#x27;m told is an extensive network of zombie corporations that are run at a loss, subsidised by the banks in order for the banks to get aid&#x2F;subsidies from the Japanese Government.Then there&#x27;s Toyota. Once a clear leader in both fossil fuel and hybrid cars that now has to issue press releases about future battery tech that isn&#x27;t even close to production. They lag behind both Tesla and the European electric car vendors in actual offerings. Likewise Nissan&#x27;s electric offerings look increasingly uncompetitive between their shenanigans getting their former non-Japanese CEO thrown in jail.If these aren&#x27;t enough - look around Japan outside of the 5 major cities.

Economics is more complicated than a simple debt figure, and I&#x27;m not well informed about the details, but the ratio of \"debt to GDP\" by itself isn&#x27;t the holy grail as far as I know. Devil&#x27;s in the details. It&#x27;s a huge problem, but not as large as the number by itself indicates.b) Japan is self contained. They have a unique self contained non-extremely-western-poisoned culture, an aging population without relying on immigration, their ethnicity makeup is 98% Japanese (I&#x27;m sure them being an island, the language and culture barrier are a factor). Find that bad or good, but I think there&#x27;s something to that, and I think it&#x27;s important when discussing their culture or their country.c) Japan is a paradise for geeks, regarding how many possessions are treated and treasured. You&#x27;ve seen outdated tech and thought it was bad? I&#x27;m here ordering old consoles, games, dvds, books from Japan and the condition \"slightly worn\" from a Japenese seller is the American equivalent to \"As good as new, perfect condition\". Japan is a paradise for cameras, old game consoles, hard to find hardware, watches, ... arcades you wouldn&#x27;t be able to find in any other country because they&#x27;ve given way to \"the times\" in other countries... you see a fax machine, or I guess potentially minidisc player, a discman, old cassette player... sold as \"new\" and think it&#x27;s bad? I&#x27;d love the fact and buy all of them...d) Toyota is one of the top 10 companies by revenue in the world, still one of the largest car manufacturers, and famous (among other Japanese companies) for efficient and world pioneering management techniques... Japan has the third highest GDP and ranks 19th in the HDI... is it maybe too soon to sing their demise?Not picking a fight, but from my perspective your comment comes off as condescending, culturally biased and close-minded... Deriding a whole country&#x2F;culture&#x2F;economy because of how you interpreted certain things while visiting...you&#x27;re citing Japanese toilet buttons as an example for their technological demise given their bad UI (having buttons)? Should it be voice controlled, have a touch panel, connect via Bluetooth to your smartphone and have its own bespoke App, offer fancy usage statistics...You were there for months and this is your cynical take? How could I, as an outsider applying a similar spirit to yours, rate China (censorship, the CCP, inequality, corruption, certain infrastructure projects, technological tracking), the US (politics, cultural crazes, depression, high school system, prison system, weapons, policing), Europe (immigration and identity crisis, EU, ...), Russia&#x2F;Ukraine..., Mexico, Brazil,...This is meant to illustrate: a cynical take is easy to come by... reply manxman 7 hours agorootparentSome interesting points. He&#x27;s my rebuttal...On (a), depends on whether you subscribe to the view the Modern Monetary Theory(MMT) is sustainable or a dangerous experiment that has unknowable consequences.(b) Japan lacks natural resources (mineral, oil&#x2F;gas etc.) and is hugely reliant on exports to keep the domestic economy running.(c) There&#x27;s a lot of cool stuff at a cultural level if you&#x27;re a geek. Geeks are alas a small percentage of the population and that cool stuff is often kind of cool because it is a snapshot of the past. Not sure the curiosities are enough to keep the show on the rails.(d) This one amused me. I recall IBMers talking about how IBM was one of the top companies by revenue right before it entered free fall and gave the tech industry to the modern tech giants. Kanban, Just-in-time manufacturing etc. were interesting and have their place. But something&#x27;s gone wrong with the Japanese mindset. The thinking that produced interesting innovation back in the 70s, 80s and maybe even early 90s seems to have given way to a stagnant way of thinking that&#x27;s evident everywhere you look. There&#x27;s niches of creativity in things like anime but the innovation in technology and in process improvement that once enabled the amazing growth that Japan saw seems to have given way to a rigid way of thinking and a culture of just following the once innovative processes instead of continually improving them.As for the voice controlled touch panel, probably not - but could the functions be simplified to less buttons and a more intuitive UI, for sure... unless you&#x27;ve embraced or complacently fallen into a culture of stagnation.On your points re: China, they&#x27;re innovating in ways Japan can only dream of without the fanfare or buzzwords. It&#x27;s why most of the products we buy come out of Chongqing or Shenzhen. There&#x27;s stuff wrong with China for sure but they&#x27;re knocking it out of the park economically compared to Japan that&#x27;s kind of riding the train over the cliff.Re: The US etc., everywhere has issues but Europe&#x2F;The US does not have the observable stagnation that can be witnessed in Japan. That&#x27;s not about condescension but about looking at what I see with an open mind and not being afraid to make critical observations based on what I see before me.I&#x27;d suggest Japan might be something of a warning for us in the West - if we stay complacent, keep worrying about superficial stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter and let the core economic&#x2F;innovating metrics trend in the wrong direction for too long we risk getting into a similar muddle. reply TerrifiedMouse 5 hours agorootparent> (b) Japan lacks natural resources (mineral, oil&#x2F;gas etc.) and is hugely reliant on exports to keep the domestic economy running.Natural resources aren&#x27;t a good predictor of economic success. In fact, most resource rich countries seem to suffer from the \"resource curse\".> but the innovation in technology and in process improvement that once enabled the amazing growth that Japan saw seems to have given way to a rigid way of thinking and a culture of just following the once innovative processes instead of continually improving them.To be frank, I think they were just as rigid back then - if not more so. The only real difference was demographics and an asset bubble. As their population ages, they stop spending. Lower spending means lower income for companies who then slash R&D and new product development. It&#x27;s visible in other sectors too like entertainment, not just technology. Jpop today is a shadow of its former self.> China, they&#x27;re innovating in ways Japan can only dream of without the fanfare or buzzwords.The same thing that happened to Japan is happening to China now - end of demographic dividend, popping of asset bubble, ... China is likely to stagnate the next few decades. The only difference is Japan got rich before things went south while China is still climbing that ladder.> Re: The US etc., everywhere has issues but Europe&#x2F;The US does not have the observable stagnation that can be witnessed in Japan.Again, it probably comes down to demographics. The West is willing to import people to keep their population rising - possibly at the expense of social stability. The Japanese decided to \"go down with the ship\" and just deal with the fallout as it comes. China ... doesn&#x27;t really have much a choice but to go down with the ship. Who the heck is going to immigrate there? reply smsm42 2 hours agorootparentprevI must note while IBM is no longer a shining beacon of innovation, it still exists, still employs almost 300K people, still part of SP100 and still one of the largest technology companies in the world.

But the success that once was Japan was about being competitive in more than just niche markets.Not sure transitioning from hybrid to EV is just a case of drop in a bigger battery. That was kind of the point I made before. From toilets to EVs, the mindset is about preserving the once advanced status quo instead of actually continuing to do “continuous improvement”.For all the adherents of Kaizen in the West or the apologists for what Japan once was, perhaps it would be wise to question why the place has managed to lose its edge across a range of metrics for multiple decades. reply hn_throwaway_99 5 hours agorootparentprevWell, to each their own I guess, I read their response and thought it gave an excellent point-by-point analysis.At a higher level, I didn&#x27;t read manxman posts as saying Japan is some sort of tech hellscape, or that their previous high-flying tech companies are all dead, but I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to argue that innovation in Japan has seriously stagnated over the past 2 decades. I left another comment where I listed tons of Japanese tech I used to have in my (US) house - now I have almost none.Regarding Toyota, I strongly disagree with \"unlike ibm they make a product that is well regarded and not in any danger of being supplanted\". I had a Toyota which I loved (it was crazy reliable) for nearly 2 decades that I replaced about 7 years ago - with an EV, and have since bought another EV. I just went to Toyota&#x27;s website and they only offer a single all-electric EV, the \"bZ4X\", which I honestly have never heard of. You say it&#x27;s as easy as \"drop in a bigger battery and call it a day\" - well, why haven&#x27;t they then? Toyota is going to get killed in the EV market, which in not too long will be the entire auto market. reply hn_throwaway_99 6 hours agorootparentprevThanks, this was a great post! It actually made me realize how, relatively recently, I had a bunch of Japanese tech in my house, but now almost none. Sony Vaio was a great laptop. I had a Sony Ericcson phone back in the day, as well as Bravia TV. I remember a family member had one of the \"mini\" Toshiba laptops in the 90s (I think it was a Portege? not sure) that I remember being so cool back then.PlayStation is still going strong, and Nintendo, too, but it&#x27;s really amazing to see how much has changed in such a short time period.I do take issue with your conclusion, though: \"Japan Inc. is a Ponzi scheme that Bernie Madoff would have loved to have conceived, veiled in superficial politeness intermingled with lots of courteous smiles and bows.\" I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really much different than modern capitalism basically being a Ponzi scheme that depends on ever increasing population. Japan just hit it a lot earlier than other places because (1) they had such a massive asset bubble in the late 80s, and 34 years later the Nikkei is still well below its peak in the late 80s, and (2) they experienced population decline well before most other advanced economies - their population peaked in 2010.Edit: Oh, and I used to own a Toyota, too, which I loved and had for nearly 2 decades. Until I replaced it with an electric vehicle. reply manxman 4 hours agorootparentI’m deeply cautious of the argument that modern capitalism is reliant on an ever increasing population.I think this perceived requirement is the result of efforts to undermine or corrupt capitalism to preserve the interests of incumbents at the expense of innovation.Innovators are always starting at zero and have literally a world of opportunity ahead of them irrespective of whether the world population is growing or declining.Apple’s growth and value creation was never about chasing user numbers as the first order priority. Instead they built an ecosystem where they delivered value to a small user base and then got that user base to buy into more product categories and services. Those users also evangelise to others more than most. That delivered massive growth that has been buffered against age&#x2F;population demographics.Alas Apple seems to be getting into maintaining value over doing real innovation now so maybe their decline is coming, but it’s interesting how the Japanese tech world has not been able to break out of the old ways of doing things and largely doesn’t seem to have learned from the advances in User eXperience that we’ve made in the past couple of decades.As for PlayStation and Nintendo, true for now but that space is about to move to VR.

It can&#x27;t come from just a smartphone company or software company, because competitors and other companies have no incentive to comply.It&#x27;s a bit of a conundrum, because a universal open standard could be really nice for the average hacker, but its practical existence implies an entity that has near total dominion over tech standards.

    "originBody": "About Writing Misc MITCHELL HASHIMOTO Reorient GitHub Pull Requests Around Changesets I've had the experience of using GitHub as a maintainer for very large open source projects (1000+ contributors), as an engineer for very large closed source corporate projects, and everything smaller. Through those experiences up to today, GitHub pull requests is where I spend almost all of my time while on GitHub, and to me its also unfortunately the most frustrating part of GitHub. There are a lot of improvements I would love to see with pull requests, but a massive chunk of my problems would be solved through one major feature: changesets. This blog post describes this suggestion and what I would love to see. Disclaimer: My ideas here are not original! I do not claim to have come up with these ideas. My suggestions here are based on well-explored Git workflows and also are partially or in full implemented by other products such as Gerrit, Phabricator, or plain ol' email-based patch review. The Problem Today The lifecycle of a GitHub pull request today is effectively one giant mutable changeset. This is a mess! Here is a typical PR today: A contributor pushes a set of commits to a branch, opens a PR, and the PR now represents that branch. People discuss the PR through comments. When the contributor pushes new changes, they show up directly on the same PR, updating it immediately. Reviewers can leave comments and the contributor can push changes at the same time, and it all updates the same PR. This has many problems: A reviewer can leave a review for a previous state the PR was in and it can become immediately outdated because while the review was happening the contributor pushed changes. Worse, a review can become partially outdated and the other feedback may not make sense in the context of the changes a contributor pushed. For example, a line comment may say \"same feedback as the previous comment\" but the previous comment is now gone/hidden because the contributor pushed a change that moved those lines.1 Reviews don't contain any metadata about the commit they were attached to, only a timestamp they were submitted. A user can roughly correlate timestamp to commit but it isn't totally accurate because if a commit comes in during a review, the timestamp will seem to imply it was after the most recent commit but your review may have been against the prior commit. 😕 Work-in-progress commits towards addressing review feedback become visible as soon as the branch is pushed. This forces contributors to address all feedback in a single commit, or for reviewers to deal with partially-addressed feedback. You can't easily scrub to prior states of the PR. If you want to review a set of earlier commits while ignoring later commits, you either have to manually build a \"compare\" view or use a local checkout (I do the latter). But through either approach you only get the code changes, you don't also get the point-in-time reviewer feedback! Similar to the above, if a contributor pushes multiple new commits, you can't easily compare the new set of commits to the old. You can only really scrub one commit at a time. For this, you again have to fallback to local git to build up a diff manually. And more... I talk about some more later, but I think I've made my point. I'm sure I'm wrong about some detail about some of the points above. Someone is likely to say \"he could've just done this to solve problem 5(a)\". That's helpful! But, the point I'm trying to make is that if you step back the fundamentals causing these problems are the real issue. Namely, a single mutable changeset tracking a branch on a per-commit basis. Changesets The solution is changesets: A pull request is versionable through a monotonic number (v1, v2, ...). These versions are often called \"changesets.\" Each changeset points to the state of a branch at a fixed time. These versions are immutable: when new commits are pushed, they become part of a new changeset. If the contributor force pushes the branch, that also becomes part of a new changeset. The previous changeset is saved forever. A new changeset can be published immediately (per commit) or it can be deferred until the contributor decides to propose a new version for review. The latter allows a contributor to make multiple commits to address prior feedback and only publish those changes when they feel ready. In the world of changesets, feedback is attached to a changeset. If a reviewer begins reviewing a changeset and a new changeset is published, that's okay because the review as an atomic unit is attached to the prior changeset. In future changesets, it is often useful to denote that a file or line has unresolved comments in prior changesets. This ensures that feedback on earlier changesets is not lost and must be addressed before any changeset is accepted. Typically, each changeset is represented by a different Git ref. For example, GitHub pull requests today are usually refs/pr/1234 and you can use git locally to check out any pull request this way. A changeset would be something like refs/pr/1234/v2 (hypothetical) so you can also check out individual changesets. Instead of \"approving\" a PR and merging, reviewers approve a changeset. This means that the contributor can also post multiple changesets with differing approaches to a problem in a single PR and the maintainer can potentially choose a non-latest changeset as the set of changes they want to merge. GitHub, Please! Changesets are a well-established pattern across many open source projects and companies. They're already a well-explored user experience problem in existing products like Gerrit and Phabricator. I also believe changesets can be introduced in a non-breaking way (since current PRs are like single-mutable-changeset mode). Changesets would make pull requests so much more scalable for larger projects and organizations. Besides the scalability, they make the review process cleaner and safer for both parties involved in pull requests. Of course, I can only speak for myself and my experience, but this single major feature would dramatically improve my quality of life and capabilities while using GitHub2. Footnotes This is a minor, inconvenient issue, but this issue scales up to serious problem. ↩ \"Just don't use GitHub!\" I've heard this feedback before. There are many other reasons I use GitHub today, so this is not a viable option for me personally right now. If you can get away with not using GitHub, then yes you can find changeset support in other products. ↩ September 30, 2023 © 2023 Mitchell Hashimoto. twitter mastodon github linkedin",

The current workflow of \"submit branch, make PR, do changes on same branch, merge latest version through web interface\" is a big part of the ease of the Github UX. Doing a merge outside of that just by pulling in the right remote branches has always been a crapshoot at best and a pain in the ass at worst. Not helped by the fact that Github&#x27;s documentation on how to do it in git is obscure (intentional I&#x27;m sure; I know it&#x27;s possible but the docs are scattered and all of it recommend just using their gh CLI tool at this point). reply __david__ 6 hours agoparent> UX would probably be more difficult though. The current workflow of \"submit branch, make PR, do changes on same branch, merge latest version through web interface\" is a big part of the ease of the Github UX.That was my first thought, too. Though perhaps a simple solution could be having GitHub, on a push, check for a new branch that matches an existing branch from a PR plus “-v2” (or “-v3”, etc.) and automatically consider that a new changeset in the PR.Or perhaps even easier is once you’ve “released” your changeset in the GitHub ui, any pushes to the branch implicitly duplicate it and put it into a new v2 branch instead. That would be a decent ui from the pushers point of view, though there’s an and asymmetry between what you push and what ends up in the repo that I’m not sure I like. reply u801e 4 hours agoparentprev> It&#x27;d be a useful thing to import without having to bring in the whole charade of using email and mailing lists (which most mail clients tend to be very unfavorable of in general nowadays)This is a misconception. git itself has commands (git-format-patch and git-send-email) that automate the creation of patches and sending changeset email threads to the mailing list. The only thing one needs to do is set the appropriate configuration settings in their git config (which is a one time operation like setting your name and email address).The actual interaction on the mailing list (responding to those who review patches and changesets can be done in any email client of one&#x27;s choosing (though it&#x27;s helpful to use an email client that supports threading using the Message-Id, In-Reply-To and Reference headers rather than one that only handles conversation view style replies). reply da39a3ee 3 hours agorootparentNo, it is not a misconception.

And in the case where they may want to offer multiple different solutions for a reviewer to choose from, I like a small adaptation of a suggestion I saw by another commenter here, which is to make a PR for each option off their existing PR&#x27;s branch: When one of those option branches is accepted and merged, GitHub will fast-forward the original PR&#x27;s branch to include those commits, which is exactly what you would want and expect. reply u801e 4 hours agoparent> It&#x27;s surprising to me that GitHub currently doesn&#x27;t attach review comments to specific commitsIt is possible to comment on commits in github (you can do it by clicking on the sha1 of the commit and then making a comment on a line in the diff).

(If you want to claim that you could quickly make a bunch of messy local commits and afterwards reorganise them into a more logical group of commits in a changeset -- you can already do that, without any new concept of changesets, by using `git rebase -i`.) reply ezekg 6 hours agoparentprevI think this is what https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphite.dev is trying to do. reply codazoda 10 hours agoprevI don’t have experience with the outlined workflow, only with GitHub PR’s, but it feels like maybe the PR’s could too big if you have this problem?I’m anticipating some push back on this, because I didn’t notice it mentioned anywhere else, even though there are a fair number of comments.

As a way to minimise the pain on GitHub today, we disallow force pushing and enforce squash merging. Force pushing is a nightmarish behaviour, once a Pull Request is opened the branch must be append only. reply akoboldfrying 7 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t understand the appeal of squash commits. AFAICT, the only advantage of squash commits is a nice \"linear history\", but you can get that from regular old merge commits just by adding --first-parent to your `git log` command -- and you still have that additional detail available on the second-parent commit chain if you need it.As soon as you start squashing commits, you throw away a very useful guarantee git gives you by default, which is that a given code change A is \"in\" a given branch B if and only if A is reachable from B. This guarantee is very helpful when debugging differences between versions, e.g., in figuring out which commits I&#x27;ve made locally are actually running in a shared environment like staging&#x2F;UAT. reply stefan_ 10 hours agoparentprevSo you have endless \"Fix a\" \"Typo\" \"fixup\" \"revert redo\" \"add y missed in z\" commits and then the squash pushes all that crap into the commit message for whatever the final mess will be?Here is a random series from DRM patchwork: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patchwork.kernel.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;dri-devel&#x2F;list&#x2F;?series=...Would you squash that? Hell no, of course not. You would be mixing atomic changes in different subsystems. It breaks bisect and makes blames a mess.Honestly, squash merges are frequently a sign of people who lack mastery in Git itself or make no effort to produce high-quality independent commits. reply oldtownroad 10 hours agorootparentA Pull Request should represent one change to the system (whether that’s a new feature or a bug fix). A commit to the Pull Request branch only has value in the context of the Pull Request. If you want a Pull Request to contain multiple atomic changes then sure, you need to do what you’re describing… but that’s entirely optional (and straying even further from the idea of changesets). reply avita1 10 hours agorootparentprev> So you have endless \"Fix a\" \"Typo\" \"fixup\" \"revert redo\" \"add y missed in z\" commits and then the squash pushes all that crap into the commit message for whatever the final mess will be?In Github at least you can set the behavior to take the PR description by default as the squashed commit message. In fairness this is not the default. The default behavior for squash merges is to ask for a new commit message right as you hit the merge button, and the default is all of the messages from the commits being squashed together.> make no effort to produce high-quality independent commitsI&#x27;m partial to sqaush merges when using github. I don&#x27;t put much effort into the individual commit messages, instead I put lots of effort into the PR description (the thing reviewers will read, and what will eventually become the commit message in revision history). That said, one of my favorite features from gerrit at a past job was that the commit message itself could be reviewed. reply piotrkaminski 8 hours agorootparent> That said, one of my favorite features from gerrit at a past job was that the commit message itself could be reviewed.Reviewable lets you review your commit messages just like any other file, BTW!

GitLab handles it much better.Relatedly, does GitHub merge understand !squash and !fixup commands? I kind of gave up on those and just accepted a few trailing bugfix commits on PRs to not mess up peoples reviews (some projects also invalidate review on force push). reply 3np 57 minutes agorootparent> some projects also invalidate review on force pushThose should also invalidate on a \"normal\" push if any changes are made. But yeah, it&#x27;d be nice to have the option to keep reviews valid on force-push if diff is identic and the only difference is rearranging commits&#x2F;messages while still invalidating on any actual changes. reply eddythompson80 10 hours agorootparentprevI’m assuming they mean squash merging into main once the PR is accepted. That way you have 1 commit on main that links back to 1 PR with N commits on it. Which is easier to follow on main branch rather than a million commits per PR reply mbakke 10 hours agorootparentThat makes \"git bisect\" and \"git blame\" fairly useless. Please don&#x27;t do that. Better to keep \"oops\" commits than squashing a series of logical changes into one monster commit. reply juped 9 hours agorootparent\"oops\" commits are bad for this too (harder to find the regression when there&#x27;s unrelated broken states), but you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s less bad.Note that you can bisect --first-parent if you want the \"just find the topic branch that introduced this\" behavior, without taking away the ability to find the actual commit! reply mbakke 9 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t know about --first-parent, thanks! That gives me something to do while narrowing down the exact commit :) reply eddythompson80 9 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think there is a one size fits all answer here. “Oops” commits make blame useless too plus they make following any meaningful change very hard.You want small commits in main, so send small PRs. If you have a feature, you can do a feature branch and merge into it the small commits then merge (don’t squash) feature branch into main. reply mbakke 9 hours agorootparentI see now that the grandparent was enforcing squash commits, did not mean to single out your comment.It just blows my mind as someone with a somewhat perfectionist approach to rebasing (to the extent I sometimes intentionally break up or reorder commits to make the changes more intentional or natural, even when it causes nasty local merge conflicts) :P reply eddythompson80 9 hours agorootparentWell, I’d appreciate it if I collaborate on a repo with you. I end up giving up commit hygiene due to the absolute lack of interest from folks I work with unfortunately :) replyhuijzer 10 hours agoparentprevOh man yes I dislike non-squash merges very much because they make it so hard to go from the Git blame to the pull request discussion reply tmpX7dMeXU 11 hours agoparentprevI’ve been contemplating pulling the trigger on this one myself. I’m pretty much sold on it. I’ve been on board with squash merging for years. Best thing I’ve ever done for our project. I eventually came to the realisation that the majority of people who were against it were so because some purist greybeard had beat it into them. reply iimblack 7 hours agorootparentMajority of people aren’t making atomic commits. In the off chance they are it’s not hard to switch from squash for those one-offs. reply Lapsa 2 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve noticed listed problems, they surely do exist. but stepping back a little - proposed solution sounds like: \"lets make a brand new version control system for already existing version control system\". reply klabb3 54 minutes agoparentNot really. There are many mature tools outside of the GitHub monoculture that do changesets, both on top of Git as well as other VCSs.I don’t do much reviews these days but I remember the confusion of GitHub PRs. Things just disappear, especially with the rebase workflow which is preferable for improving reviewer burden.I think Mitchell is mostly right here: a changeset is the most natural data structure for maintaining code. However, is it also the most natural construct for storing code in repositories, ie “should git be replaced in the long term?”. Can the merkle tree of blobs be replaced by an analogous merkle tree of changesets? That I don’t know. But it’s a worthwhile idea. reply m3drano 12 hours agoprevIIUC, he&#x27;s referring to a workflow that Gerrit implements 1-to-1, isn&#x27;t he? reply imran-iq 11 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s the email flow that&#x27;s existed before gerrit and phabricator.

I’m the creator of what I believe is a better review interface for GitHub (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeapprove.com) but there are also many others: * CodeApprove (codeapprove.com) * Graphite (graphite.dev) * Reviewable (reviewable.io) * Axolo (axolo.co) * Viezly (viezly.com) * Mergeboard (mergeboard.com) * Codestream (codestream.com) * Pullpo (pullpo.io) * ReviewPad (reviewpad.com) * Planar (useplanar.com) * Visibly (visibly.dev) * Codelantis (codelantis.com)I think in the end we should not expect GitHub to provide the best option here. We should expect them to provide a basic option (which they do) and for sophisticated consumers to pay more for a much better option. Everyone should be shopping for code review tools! reply noirscape 10 hours agoparentI disagree on this; GitHub should be building the best option here if they have the resources to do so. The fact that the review interface is as basic as it and so prone to accidentally marking the wrong comments as outdated is a major issue (one that other software like Phorge[0] already shows is possible if we&#x27;re sticking to the realm of \"non-mailing client reliant git servers\").Having to bolt extra features on top of GitHub to make it work properly is a shortcoming of GitHub, it shouldn&#x27;t be an opportunity to build more tooling the customer has to pay for on top of it.

They have a big platform with lots of features besides code review, so even though they also have lots of employees they won&#x27;t be able to focus on code review as much as a dedicated company could. They also have a huge number of users to please so they can&#x27;t afford to rock the boat too much or make the learning curve too steep.I think therefore it&#x27;s pretty much inevitable that if you need a more advanced code review tool you&#x27;ll end up picking a third party one.

Self-hosting Git is definitely not as easy as setting up a GH account.Not to mention that you get an easy way to spin up your CI&#x2F;CD workflows in GH Actions (which of course definitely has its own problems, which there was another popular HN post about recently). There&#x27;s a reason why it&#x27;s the default for new companies -- if there was something much better, it wouldn&#x27;t have the market share it does I think. Familiarity coming from OSS is also important. reply piotrkaminski 8 hours agorootparentprevMost frequently, I think it&#x27;s because you want a single platform to store all company code, but not all teams agree on using GitHub PRs vs a more advanced code review tool. Other potential reasons include having access to the other GitHub features: issues, actions, security stuff, the merge queue, etc. You could pull all these together from less-overpriced more-specialized alternatives, of course, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have a single integrated platform even if you decide to replace one of its features. reply fahhem 8 hours agorootparentprevGitHub is a platform with dozens of tools, I think of it as a basic toolbox.

This makes it lighter weight to offer comments since it doesn&#x27;t mean another delay for a rereview. The reviewer gets emailed about any new commits that come in, so all changes do get seen.Github makes it easy to review just the changes since your last approval, a feature which I think obviates the need for changesets as in the OP. reply kemayo 10 hours agoprevI work with Gerrit in my job, and find a stack of patches to be a useful way to deal with things... but I&#x27;ve also seen that it definitely has a learning curve for people who&#x27;re not used to it. There&#x27;s something to be said for the GitHub pull-request \"just smush together all the commits on this branch\" model in terms of ease of understanding.It&#x27;s possible that better tooling would help there, of course.(A surprisingly common pain-point with Gerrit is when you&#x27;ve wound up with a semi-long-lasting stack of patches for some reason, and then you develop a branching tree of sub-patches and need to rebase them all when you make some change higher up.

GitHub likely has to bias towards the beige middle ground that suits everyone well enough. reply epolanski 9 hours agoprevJm2c, but by far the best place I&#x27;ve ever worked (my current client) we don&#x27;t do code reviews at all unless the author wants feedback.PRs are good ways to defend your code base from bad code, and they were born in open source where you literally have no clue who the contributor is, but years of experience left me convinced that I don&#x27;t want such a system where there&#x27;s constant need to overview each other&#x27;s work.I want to work with a team where there is high respect and trust. A team where I know I won&#x27;t like or love all the decisions others make, but I trust their judgement. Maybe they did indeed hack an ugly solution cheating the type system and automated controls. So what? What matters is if they have done so for good reasons (stuff was super urgent, a proper solution was just not worth the effort as the feature&#x2F;fix was really not important for the business).This made development speed skyrocket and I&#x27;m no longer bound to infinite code reviews as if we were sending rockets on Mars.I also want to say, code quality is high, but this stems both from working with great individuals that can be trusted and from much higher interaction speed. reply neo2006 9 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t see code review as an overwatch but a good communication tool and a way to think about problems collectively. Code review reduce bugs because it permit to have people think about the problem from multiple angles. About decisions, I think important design decisions need to be taken prior to the code review steps ,and also reviewed. I&#x27;m not sure what context you worked in that gave you that opinion about code review being a sign of distrust and I think the problem lay within the culture in those places not the code review practice it self. reply duncan-donuts 9 hours agorootparentI don’t mind code reviews so I’m not really defending who you’re replying to. There is another way to think about this tho and I actually have found this practice to be light years more effective than code reviews. Where I work we have a practice where before you start doing a ton of work on your card&#x2F;ticket you should find someone on your team, explain the problem to them, and show them how you’re going to do the work. This gives your teammates an opportunity to give you feedback before anyone has done anything, and you can both poke holes in design decisions before anyone has done anything they feel strongly about. If you do this process 95% of code reviews are pretty much worthless. reply neo2006 8 hours agorootparentI fully agree, we also do this and this is the design review I alluded to. That said, I think both have different purpose. The design review is more about the approach and the high-level implementation. The code review is about the implementation details. Also, a great aspect often overlooked around code review is that it&#x27;s a great teaching tool if used right. Asking question go a long way and make both the reviewer and the reviewee learn. Code review is often looked to as a senior watching over what juniors are doing. In my experience it should be done for all levels and even juniors should review seniors PR as they can bring novel perspective and at least learn from the code by reviewing it. reply epolanski 8 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m gonna rephrase my previous point. What you say makes sense, but only if you understand that it takes away time, money and energies and after knowing it, and the impact of all this time drag you determine it&#x27;s worth it.Might apply to huge products making millions $ every day. Sure, delivering a bug will be expensive.Might apply when you can&#x27;t trust your colleagues (not skilled, reasonable or experienced enough).Might apply if your code is niche but mission critical (maybe some safety system on a car or a dangerous tool, or surgery equipment).Of course I agree with all you said.But you&#x27;re writing some Java&#x2F;TS web app which isn&#x27;t raking much money, or has still to be launched, or your biggest focus is time to market to beat competitors and you&#x27;re wasting time on code reviews the author hasn&#x27;t requested?In this scenario (my current client) I want to have a team I can trust and gets stuff done. This does not imply that CRs don&#x27;t happen or design isn&#x27;t discussed, but it happens when it brings value or it is needed. And I like it that way, where we can build stuff, rather discussing how to build it. reply neo2006 6 hours agorootparentIf we want to include the cost of a code review into the equation we should also include the cost of fixing a big that made it to production which is in most of the cases higher then code review. Skill is not a factor here, I work and worked with some of the best engineers in the world and everyone write buggy code sometimes. Software engineering is a complex practice.

As another commenter stated - Code Reviews are, for me, primarily a method for communication and knowledge dissemination, secondarily a means to get a second pair of eyes on my work to ensure it&#x27;s legible and that I didn&#x27;t miss anything, and only as a distant third a means to \"protect\" the codebase. reply jacobegold 8 hours agorootparentNot to mention the value of a diff&#x2F;pull request&#x2F;changelist&#x2F;patch&#x2F;merge request (so many names...) and its corresponding discussion as a historical artifact for your team to reference later on! reply RHSeeger 8 hours agoparentprevI trust and respect the people I work with. I also prefer to have code reviews, even (especially) of my own code. Code reviews can point out code that- Doesn&#x27;t consider an edge case (NPEs being the most common)- Doesn&#x27;t match up well with the \"standard\" way we do things (and, all things being equal, using the same approach in every place improves maintainability)- Has a simpler approach- Doesn&#x27;t have a comment where it&#x27;s not clear _why_ the code is doing something (that the author of the code sees as obvious, because they wrote it)- Has misleading method&#x2F;class&#x2F;field namesThese are all things that I&#x27;ve seen from both myself and others on my team. Having one other team member take a look at my code before it goes to QA can save a lot of time later. reply epolanski 8 hours agorootparentNone of the things you said matters if your issue is time to market or you have little business.Who cares about an edge case no user&#x27;s gonna see?Who cares about an edge case for a non business critical feature?Who cares if there was a better way to implement something if it&#x27;s not a priority?Our work it&#x27;s not meant to give us devs intellectual challenges but solve people&#x27;s problems.All the things you list are reasonable if you&#x27;re making money or they are core to the product or they impact user&#x27;s safety in any way.Otherwise they don&#x27;t matter at all.And half the things you list are solved by having high hiring standards and paying people well.Stuff may not be perfect, maybe there will be better ways, maybe it will be inconsistent at times but it will be more than good enough and move the business forward at much higher speed. Also, just to reiterate I&#x27;ve never stated that we don&#x27;t have standards or make architectural decisions or don&#x27;t give feedback. I merely stated that reviewing PRs for us is an exception, not a rule and that I prefer a system of trust. reply RHSeeger 6 hours agorootparentMy goal is to build things that work, and can continue to be worked on and improved over time; where development doesn&#x27;t grind to a halt in 6 months because nobody cares about quality.Edge cases matter sometimes matter and sometimes do not. They particularly matter in cases where, if the happen, the leave the system in a bad state (corrupt data, etc). Having a second pair of eyes take a look at the code and think \"where can this go wrong\" doesn&#x27;t cost much, but can save a lot of pain later.Doing things in a simpler way and&#x2F;or a way that matches the way we generally do things makes it easier to maintain. And it&#x27;s fairly common for code maintenance and&#x2F;or further development on the same code, to be more common than writing brand new functionality (code that doesn&#x27;t touch existing code). This is directly related to the \"grind to a halt\" I mentioned earlier.Literally nothing I mentioned can be solved by hiring standards or pay. Once, because hiring people new to software development is a thing. Two, because everyone... EVERYONE makes mistakes. And EVERYONE can do better with the help of their peers.I prefer that every PR get reviewed by someone, with the (uncommon) exception of those where the developer says it isn&#x27;t worth a review. It generally takes very little time, and it adds to delivered code quality. reply quacker 6 hours agoparentprevAgree. The better your team members, the less need there is for code review.However, the approach of few&#x2F;no code reviews doesn’t work for large open source projects that accept external contributions (the author of the post is mitchellh who is a founder of HashiCorp, which has&#x2F;had several large open source projects). reply devin-sills 7 hours agoparentprevSame experience here. Productivity unlocks like crazy, and amazingly the sky doesn&#x27;t fall. It does require stringent hiring practices though and a flat, open culture.

Bad commits are not pleasant to look at, but they carry information, too, e.g., revealing the need for discussion. It&#x27;s a bit like asynchronous pairing.I don&#x27;t think looking at the code on a website is sufficient as review in many cases, so I typically have a copy of the branch anyway. If any feature is needed, it is the possibiliy to comment on unchanged lines.It probably depends on the scope. If the reviewer works on a more abstract level and can rely on authors to get the details right, maybe github is not ideal. Where the reviewer is almost as deeply involved as the author, a branch works nicely. reply nmadden 12 hours agoparentprevI did wonder about that when I read it.

If the new PR update deletes the associated lines of code, there is arguably a need for those types of comments to be manually added with the current interface, but not so with a changeset oriented interface.I like the append only nature of a changeset oriented interface.But I find this type of conversation quite fiddly to do in pure text without reference to examples and the actual use of both styles, so forgive me if this is still unclear. reply cryptonector 5 hours agoprevIOW, something like stackable PRs. reply jauntywundrkind 10 hours agoprevGenerally, it feels like a bit of a farce that source code is very well well version controlled, but nothing else is.Data isn&#x27;t well managed.

Was Their Work a Lie? Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino became famous for their research into why we bend the truth. Now they’ve both been accused of fabricating data. By Gideon Lewis-Kraus September 30, 2023 An observer said, “We were, like, Holy shit, there are two different people independently faking data on the same paper.”Illustration by Bryce Wymer The half-bearded behavioral economist Dan Ariely tends to preface discussions of his work—which has inquired into the mechanisms of pain, manipulation, and lies—with a reminder that he comes by both his eccentric facial hair and his academic interests honestly. He tells a version of the story in the introduction to his breezy first book, “Predictably Irrational,” a patchwork of marketing advice and cerebral self-help. One afternoon in Israel, Ariely—an “18-year-old military trainee,” according to the Times—was nearly incinerated. “An explosion of a large magnesium flare, the kind used to illuminate battlefields at night, left 70 percent of my body covered with third-degree burns,” he writes. He spent three years in the hospital, a period that estranged him from the routine practices of everyday life. The nurses, for example, stripped his bandages all at once, as per the cliché. Ariely suspected that he might prefer a gradual removal, even if the result was a greater sum of agony. In an early psychological experiment he later conducted, he submitted this instinct to empirical review. He subsequently found that certain manipulations of an unpleasant experience might make it seem milder in hindsight. In onstage patter, he referred to a famous study in which researchers gave colonoscopy patients either a painful half-hour procedure or a painful half-hour procedure that concluded with a few additional minutes of lesser misery. The patients preferred the latter, and this provided a reliable punch line for Ariely, who liked to say that the secret was to “leave the probe in.” This was not, strictly speaking, optimal—why should we prefer the scenario with bonus pain? But all around Ariely people seemed trapped by a narrow understanding of human behavior. “If the nurses, with all their experience, misunderstood what constituted reality for the patients they cared so much about, perhaps other people similarly misunderstand the consequences of their behaviors,” he writes. “Predictably Irrational,” which was published in 2008, was an instant airport-book classic, and augured an extraordinarily successful career for Ariely as an enigmatic swami of the but-actually circuit. Ariely was born in New York City in 1967 and grew up north of Tel Aviv; his father ran an import-export business. He studied psychology at Tel Aviv University, then returned to the United States for doctoral degrees in cognitive psychology at the University of North Carolina and in business administration at Duke. He liked to say that Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize-winning Israeli American psychologist, had pointed him in this direction. In the previous twenty years, Kahneman and his partner, Amos Tversky, had pioneered the field of “judgment and decision-making,” which revealed the rational-actor model of neoclassical economics to be a convenient fiction. (The colonoscopy study that Ariely loved, for example, was Kahneman’s.) Ariely, a wily character with a vivid origin story, presented himself as the natural heir to this new science of human folly. In 1998, with his pick of choice appointments, he accepted a position at M.I.T. Despite having little training in economics, he seemed poised to help renovate the profession. “In Dan’s early days, he was the most celebrated young intellectual academic,” a senior figure in the discipline told me. “I wouldn’t say he was known for being super careful, but he had a reputation as a serious scientist, and was considered the future of the field.” The new discipline might have lent itself to a tragic view of life. Our preferences were arbitrary and incoherent; no narrator was reliable. What differentiated Ariely was his faith that we could be managed. “It is very sad that we are fallible, myopic, vindictive, and emotional,” he told me by e-mail. “But in my view this perspective also means, and this is the optimistic side, that we can do much better.” Take, for example, cheating. If people are utility-maximizing agents, they will fleece as much as they can get away with. Ariely believed, to the contrary, that a potential cheater has to balance two conflicting desires: the urge to max out his gains and the need to see himself as a good person. In experiments, Ariely found that most people cheat when given the opportunity—but just a little. Ariely, who does not shy from cutesiness, called this the “fudge factor.” In turn, he proposed, people might just need to be reminded that they aspire to be decent. In one of his most famous experiments, he asked students to score their own math tests. Half the students had first been asked to list the Ten Commandments. Although most could recall only a few, Ariely found that, in this group, “nobody cheated.” The insight was simple, the intervention subtle, and the consequences enormous. Ariely came to owe his reputation to his work on dishonesty. He offered commentary in documentaries on Elizabeth Holmes and pontificated about Enron. As Remy Levin, an economics professor at the University of Connecticut, told me, “People often go into this field to study their own inner demons. If you feel bad about time management, you study time inconsistency and procrastination. If you’ve had issues with fear or trauma, you study risk-taking.” Pain was an obvious place for Ariely to start. But his burn scars heightened his sensitivity to truthfulness. Shane Frederick, a professor at Yale’s business school, told me, “One of the first things Dan said to me when we met was ‘Would you ever date someone who looked like me?’ And I said, ‘No fucking way,’ which was a really offensive thing to say to someone—but it weirdly seemed to charm Dan.” From that moment, Frederick felt, Ariely was staunchly supportive of his career. At the same time, Ariely seemed to struggle with procedural norms, especially when they seemed pointless. Once, during a large conference, John Lynch, one of Ariely’s mentors, was rushed to the hospital. Ariely told me that only family members were allowed to visit. He pretended that his scarring was an allergic reaction and, once he was admitted, spent the night by Lynch’s side. In his telling, the nurse was in on the charade. “We were just going through the motions so that she could let me in,” he told me. But a business-school professor saw it differently. “Dan was seen as a hero because he had this creative solution,” she said. “But the hospital staff, even though they knew this wasn’t a real allergic reaction, weren’t allowed to not admit him. He was just wasting their time because he felt like he shouldn’t have to follow their rules.” “Well, technically, I have an abrasive personality and a tendency to alienate everyone around me, but, sure, let’s go with ‘lone wolf.’ ” Cartoon by Jake Thompson Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop A decade or so into his career, Ariely’s focus shifted to applied research. A former affiliate told me that Ariely once said, “Some behavioral economist is going to win the Nobel Prize—what do I have to do to be in contention?” (Ariely denies wondering whether he would get the Nobel Prize.) In the spring of 2007, he asked an insurance company if he could replace its ordinary automobile-policy review form with experimental versions of his own. Customers had an incentive to underreport their annual mileage, in order to pay lower premiums. Half the participants were to receive a form that asked them to sign an honesty declaration at the end. The other half were to receive an alternate version, which instructed them to sign a pledge at the beginning. The following year, on his first book tour, Ariely addressed a crowd at Google, where he was later contracted to advise on a behavioral-science project, and referred in passing to the experiment’s results. Those who signed at the beginning, he said, had been more candid than those who signed at the end. “This was all about decreasing the fudge factor,” he said. In 2009, Ariely noted in the Harvard Business Review that the insurance company had updated its own forms to exploit his finding. He hadn’t yet published the study, which, given its obvious importance, might have seemed peculiar. But, at the time, nothing appeared to indicate that the results weren’t trustworthy. “People who go through a tragedy like Dan, with his burn—they have an insight into what’s important in life,” the filmmaker Yael Melamede, who collaborated with Ariely on a documentary about dishonesty, told me. “He was very aware of the dangerous desire to make experiments go your way, to bend reality to your benefit.” Despite a good deal of readily available evidence to the contrary, neoclassical economics took it for granted that humans were rational. Kahneman and Tversky found flaws in this assumption, and built a compendium of our cognitive biases. We rely disproportionately on information that is easily retrieved: a recent news article about a shark attack seems much more relevant than statistics about how rarely such attacks actually occur. Our desires are in flux—we might prefer pizza to hamburgers, and hamburgers to nachos, but nachos to pizza. We are easily led astray by irrelevant details. In one experiment, Kahneman and Tversky described a young woman who had studied philosophy and participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations, then asked a group of participants which inference was more probable: either “Linda is a bank teller” or “Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.” More than eighty per cent chose the latter, even though it is a subset of the former. We weren’t Homo economicus; we were giddy and impatient, our thoughts hasty, our actions improvised. Economics tottered. Behavioral economics emerged for public consumption a generation later, around the time of Ariely’s first book. Where Kahneman and Tversky held that we unconsciously trick ourselves into doing the wrong thing, behavioral economists argued that we might, by the same token, be tricked into doing the right thing. In 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein published “Nudge,” which argued for what they called “libertarian paternalism”—the idea that small, benign alterations of our environment might lead to better outcomes. When employees were automatically enrolled in 401(k) programs, twice as many saved for retirement. This simple bureaucratic rearrangement improved a great many lives. Thaler and Sunstein hoped that libertarian paternalism might offer “a real Third Way—one that can break through some of the least tractable debates in contemporary democracies.” Barack Obama, who hovered above base partisanship, found much to admire in the promise of technocratic tinkering. He restricted his outfit choices mostly to gray or navy suits, based on research into “ego depletion,” or the concept that one might exhaust a given day’s reservoir of decision-making energy. When, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Obama was told that money “framed” as income was more likely to be spent than money framed as wealth, he enacted monthly tax deductions instead of sending out lump-sum stimulus checks. He eventually created a behavioral-sciences team in the White House. (Ariely had once found that our decisions in a restaurant are influenced by whoever orders first; it’s possible that Obama was driven by the fact that David Cameron, in the U.K., was already leaning on a “nudge unit.”) The nudge, at its best, was modest—even a minor potential benefit at no cost pencilled out. In the Obama years, a pop-up on computers at the Department of Agriculture reminded employees that single-sided printing was a waste, and that advice reduced paper use by six per cent. But as these ideas began to intermingle with those in the adjacent field of social psychology, the reasonable notion that some small changes could have large effects at scale gave way to a vision of individual human beings as almost boundlessly pliable. Even Kahneman was convinced. He told me, “People invented things that shouldn’t have worked, and they were working, and I was enormously impressed by it.” Some of these interventions could be implemented from above. Brian Wansink, a researcher at Cornell, reported that an attractive wire rack and a lamp increased fruit sales at a school by fifty-four per cent, and that buffet diners likely consumed fewer calories when “cheesy eggs” weren’t immediately at hand. Other techniques were akin to personal mind cures. In 2010, the Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy purported to show that subjects who held an assertive “power pose” could measurably improve their confidence and “instantly become more powerful.” In advance of job interviews, prospective employees retreated to corporate bathrooms to extend their arms in victorious V’s. In 2017, Thaler won the Nobel Prize for his analysis of “economic decision-making with the aid of insights from psychology.” Some policy nudges did not ultimately survive empirical scrutiny (though early studies showed that making organ donation opt-out rather than opt-in would cause the practice to become more widespread, long-term evaluations suggested that it had little effect), but the bulk of them held up. By that point, however, a maximalist version of the principle—easily absorbed by viral life-hack culture—had become commonplace. Ariely, for his part, predicted that nudges were just the beginning, and held out for more ambitious social engineering. He told me, “I thought that in many cases paternalism is going to be necessary.” At the end of “Predictably Irrational,” he writes, “If I were to distill one main lesson from the research described in this book, it is that we are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend.” Haaretz once called Ariely “the busiest Israeli in the world.” I met him several times in the past year, although he agreed to speak on the record mostly in writing. A stimulating and slightly unnerving interlocutor, he has coarse black bangs, tented eyebrows, and the frank but hooded aspect of an off-duty mentalist or a veteran card-counter. “Predictably Irrational” considerably expanded his sphere of influence. He started a lab at Duke called the Center for Advanced Hindsight, which was funded by BlackRock and MetLife. He had a wife and two young children in Durham, but spent only a handful of days a month in town. In a given week, he might fly from São Paulo to Berlin to Tel Aviv. At talks, he wore rumpled polos and looked as though he’d trimmed his hair with a nail clipper in an airport-lounge rest room. He has said that he worked with multiple governments and Apple. He had ideas for how to negotiate with the Palestinians. When an interviewer asked him to list the famous names in his phone contacts, he affected humility: “Jeff Bezos, the C.E.O. of Amazon—is that good?” He went on: the C.E.O.s of Procter & Gamble and American Express, the founder of Wikipedia. In 2012, he said, he got an e-mail from Prince Andrew, who invited him to the palace for tea. Ariely’s assistant had to send him a jacket and tie via FedEx. He couldn’t bring himself, as an Israeli, to say “Your Royal Highness,” so he addressed the Prince by saying “Hey.” VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER La Isla: Women Speak Out After Mass Arrests in El Salvador Ariely seemed to know everything and everyone. “What an amazing life to lead,” a former doctoral student in his lab said. “It was like ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel.’ ” He told people that he’d climbed Annapurna and rafted down the Mekong River. But he was also attentive. “Every single time I went into the room and interacted with Dan, it was unbelievably enjoyable,” the student said. At one talk, he auctioned off a hundred-dollar bill, with the stipulation that the second-highest bidder would also have to pay. The winner owed a hundred and fifty dollars; the loser owed a hundred and forty-five dollars for nothing. Both might have felt like idiots, but Ariely wasn’t scornful; he sympathized. His knowledge of human behavior could be burdensome. “It makes daily interactions a little difficult,” he said. “I know all kinds of methods to convince people to do things I want them to do.” He told me, “Just imagine that you could separate the people who are your real friends from the people who want something from you. . . . And now ask yourself if you really want to know this about them.” One of his frequent collaborators was Francesca Gino, a rising star in the field. Gino is in her mid-forties, with dark curly hair and a frazzled aspect. She grew up in Italy, where she pursued a doctorate in economics and management. Members of her cohort remember her dedication, industry, and commitment. She first came to Harvard Business School as a visiting fellow, and, once she completed her Ph.D., in 2004, she stayed on as a postdoc. She later said that she went to Harvard for a nine-month stint and never left. This story elides a few detours. By the end of her postdoc, in 2006, she had yet to publish an academic paper, and Harvard did not extend an offer. One of her mentors at Harvard, a professor named Max Bazerman, helped make introductions; she eventually landed a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon. A senior colleague who knew her at the time told me, “That entire experience could plausibly have left her with a keen sense of the fragility and precariousness of academic careers.” At last, she seemed to find her footing, and it soon looked as though she could get almost any study to produce results. She secured a job at U.N.C., where she entered a phase of elevated productivity. According to her C.V., she published seven journal papers in 2009; in 2011, an astonishing eleven. Ariely and Gino frequently collaborated on dishonesty. In the paper “The Dark Side of Creativity,” they showed that “original thinkers,” who can dream up convincing justifications, tend to lie more easily. For “The Counterfeit Self,” she and Ariely had a group of women wear what they were told were fake Chloé sunglasses—the designer accessories, in an amusing control, were actually real—and then take a test. They found that participants who believed they were wearing counterfeit sunglasses cheated more than twice as much as the control group. In “Sidetracked,” Gino’s first pop-science book, she seems to note that such people were not necessarily corrupt: “Being human makes all of us vulnerable to subtle influences.” In 2010, she returned to Harvard Business School, where she was awarded an endowed professorship and later became the editor of a leading journal. She dispensed page-a-day-calendar advice on LinkedIn: “Life is an unpredictable journey. . . . The challenge isn’t just setting our path, but staying on it amidst chaos.” She was a research consultant for Disney, and a speakers bureau quoted clients between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars to book her for gigs. In 2020, she was the fifth-highest-paid employee at Harvard, earning about a million dollars that year—slightly less than the university’s president. Gino drew admiring notice from those who could not believe her productivity. The business-school professor said, “She’s not just brilliant and successful and wealthy—she has been a kind, fun person to know. She was well liked even by researchers who were skeptical of her work.” But she drew less admiring notice, too—also from people who could not believe her productivity. As one management scholar told me, “You just cannot trust someone who is publishing ten papers a year in top journals.” Other co-authors, as collateral beneficiaries, weren’t sure what to think. One former graduate student thought that she caught Gino plagiarizing portions of a literature review, but tried to convince herself that it was an honest error. Later, in a study for a different paper, “Gino was, like, ‘I had an idea for an additional experiment that would tie everything together, and I already collected the data and wrote it up—here are the results.’ ” The former graduate student added, “My adviser was, like, ‘Did you design the study together? No. Did you know it was going to happen? No. Has she sent you the data? No. Something off is happening here.’ ” (Gino declined to address these allegations on the record.) Cartoon by Liana Finck Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop In late 2010, Gino was helping to coördinate a symposium for an Academy of Management conference, on “behavioral ethics,” which listed Ariely as a contributor. At the time, Gino and Bazerman were researching moral identity. Ariely’s findings with the car-insurance company remained unpublished, but his talks had made the rounds, and his field study seemed like the perfect companion piece for joint publication. “I suggest we add them as co-authors and write up the paper for a top tier journal,” Gino later wrote, by e-mail. The paper, which was published in 2012, became an event. Signing the honesty pledge at the beginning, Ariely found, reduced cheating by about ten per cent. The Obama Administration included the paper’s findings in an annual White House report. Government bodies in the U.K., Canada, and Guatemala initiated studies to determine whether they should revise their tax forms, and estimated that they might recoup billions of dollars a year. Kahneman told me that he saw no reason to disbelieve the results, which were clearly compatible with the orientation of the field. “But many things that might work don’t,” he told me. “And it’s not necessarily clear a priori.” Near the end of Obama’s first term, vast swaths of overly clever behavioral science began to come unstrung. In 2011, the Cornell psychologist Daryl Bem published a journal article that ostensibly proved the existence of clairvoyance. His study participants were able to predict, with reasonable accuracy, which curtain on a computer screen hid an erotic image. The idea seemed parodic, but Bem was serious, and had arrived at his results using methodologies entirely in line with the field’s standard practices. This was troubling. The same year, three young behavioral-science professors—Joe Simmons, Leif Nelson, and Uri Simonsohn—published an actual parody: in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” they “proved” that listening to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four” rendered study participants literally a year and a half younger. “It was hard to think of something that was so crazy that no one would believe it, because compared to what was actually being published in our journals nothing was that crazy,” Nelson, who teaches at U.C. Berkeley, said. Researchers could measure dozens of variables and perform reams of analyses, then publish only the correlations that happened to appear “significant.” If you tortured the data long enough, as one grim joke went, it would confess to anything. They called such techniques “p-hacking.” As they later put it, “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk.” In fact, they wrote, “it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.” The three men—who came to be called Data Colada, the name of their pun-friendly blog—had bonded over the false, ridiculous, and flashy findings that the field was capable of producing. The discipline of judgment and decision-making had made crucial, enduring contributions—the foundation laid by Kahneman and Tversky, for example—but the broader credibility of the behavioral sciences had been compromised by a perpetual-motion machine of one-weird-trick gimmickry. Their paper helped kick off what came to be known as the “replication crisis.” Soon, entire branches of supposedly reliable findings—on social priming (the idea that, say, just thinking about an old person makes you walk more slowly), power posing, and ego depletion—started to seem like castles in the air. (Cuddy, the H.B.S. professor, defended her work, later publishing a study that showed power posing had an effect on relevant “feelings.”) Some senior figures in the field were forced to consider the possibility that their contributions amounted to nothing. In the course of its campaign to eradicate p-hacking, which was generally well intended, Data Colada also uncovered manipulations that were not. The psychologist Lawrence Sanna had conducted studies that literalized the metaphor of a “moral high ground,” determining that participants at higher altitudes were “more prosocial.” When Simonsohn looked into the data, he found that the numbers were not “compatible” with random sampling; they had clearly been subject to tampering. (Sanna, at the time, acknowledged “research errors.”) Simonsohn exposed similar curiosities in the work of the Flemish psychologist Dirk Smeesters. (Smeesters claimed that he engaged only in “massaging” data.) The two men’s careers came to an unceremonious end. Occasionally, these probes were simple: one of the first papers that Data Colada formally examined included reports of “-0.3” on a scale of zero to ten. Other efforts required more recondite statistical analysis. Behind these techniques, however, was a basic willingness to call bullshit. Some of the papers in social psychology and adjacent fields demonstrated effects that seemed, to anyone roughly familiar with the behavior of people, preposterous: when maids are prompted to think of their duties as exercise, do they really lose weight? Kahneman graciously conceded that he had been wrong to endorse some of this research, and told me, of Data Colada, “They’re heroes of mine.”But not everyone was supportive. Data Colada’s harshest critics saw the young men as jealous upstarts who didn’t understand the soft artistry of the social sciences. Norbert Schwarz, an éminence grise of psychology, interrupted a presentation about questionable research practices at a conference, and later called the burgeoning reform movement a “witch hunt.” A former president of the Association for Psychological Science, in a leaked editorial, referred to such efforts as “methodological terrorism.” When Data Colada posted about Amy Cuddy, it was taken as evidence of borderline misogyny. The Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert referred to the “replication police” as “shameless little bullies”; others compared Data Colada to the Stasi. Simonsohn found this analogy hurtful and offensive. “We’re like data journalists,” he said. “All we can do is inform people with power. The only power you have is being right.” Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn maintain a standing Zoom date once a week. Recently, they invited me to join. They’ve been working together long enough to finish one another’s sentences—the only real pleasure in what they do. Their work can be demoralizing, and after each successive fraud investigation they swear off the practice. “It’s pleasant for maybe an hour,” Simonsohn, who teaches at the Esade Business School, in Barcelona, told me. “You notice how they did it, and it feels great, like you wrote a mystery novel. But then everything feels bad.” Simmons, a professor at Wharton, added, “We have this unfortunate fraud detector in our brain. Obviously, it’s just an internal alarm and you have to then check, but you see results sections that stand out as ‘No no no, that’s not a thing.’ ” He remarked that Nelson had sent him a screenshot of a figure from a journal; with only a glance, Simmons would have bet his house that the data were fake, but the men didn’t plan to pursue the case. “At this point, it’s like an affliction,” Simmons said. “But if you see it you see it, and then it’s hard to look the other way.” There is a propensity to write off such misconduct as a victimless crime. In the spring of 2021, Data Colada was contacted by Zoé Ziani, a recent Ph.D. recipient whose professional trajectory offered an example of the practice’s collateral damage. Ziani is slight and angular, but she projects considerable tensile strength. She grew up in a working-class neighborhood of Paris; her parents had not graduated from college, but she was enchanted by academia. “People were paid just to think and talk about how things work,” she told me. Assessing the fallout of the financial crisis, she found herself wondering how an entire industry could have developed a culture of malfeasance. “Nobody reacted before the worst happened,” she said. “Nobody raised their hands to say, ‘This is really risky, and we should stop.’ ” In graduate school, Ziani took up the question of how individuals form and exploit professional networks—such as the ones she had to assemble from nothing. One recent high-profile contribution to the networking literature was a paper by Gino. Some participants had been asked to think of a time they had networked in an “instrumental” way, and then to fill in the blanks for prompts such as “W _ _ H,” “SH _ _ ER,” and “S _ _ P.” These people were more likely to complete the prompts with such cleaning-related words as “WASH,” “SHOWER,” and “SOAP”—in other words, networking made them feel literally unclean. Ziani found Gino’s results implausible, and assumed that they had been heavily p-hacked. She told me, “This crowd is used to living in a world where you have enough degrees of freedom to do whatever you want and all that matters is that it works beautifully.” But an adviser strongly suggested that Ziani “build on” the paper, which had appeared in a top journal. When she expressed her doubts, the adviser snapped at her, “Don’t ever say that!” Members of Ziani’s dissertation committee couldn’t understand why this nobody of a student was being so truculent. In the end, two of them refused to sign off on her degree if she did not remove criticisms of Gino’s paper from her dissertation. One warned Ziani not to second-guess a professor of Gino’s stature in this way. In an e-mail, the adviser wrote, “Academic research is like a conversation at a cocktail party. You are storming in, shouting ‘You suck!’ ” “You know what I like about them? You’d never guess they have kids!” Cartoon by Carolita Johnson Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop Ziani complied, but her professional relationships had deteriorated, and she soon left the cocktail party for good. When she told me these stories, in a wood-panelled bar at a historic hotel in Boulder, Colorado, she covered her face to cry. Simmons told me that he could name countless people who had similar experiences. “Some people are hurt by this stuff and they don’t even know. They think they’re not good enough—‘It must be me’—so they leave the field,” he said. “That’s where I started to get angry. How many Zoés are there?” Ziani had moved to Colorado, in 2020, for her husband’s job. In the spring of 2021, she set out to replicate Gino’s study. She asked for the data, and, after some delay, received it. That April, she used an online survey platform to re-create the experiment. It took a few days, and she found none of the reported effects. She also determined, more worrisomely, that there was almost no way the paper’s effect size could have been naturally generated. “I knew there was something fishy there,” Ziani said. “More than fishy.” She and a collaborator (who wished to remain anonymous, for fear of professional retribution) approached Data Colada. The team had had its own doubts about Gino since 2014, but had concluded that a full investigation was more trouble than it was worth. Now, however, they scrutinized her previous work, and found multiple instances of data that seemed to be misbehaving. Ziani said, “The magnitude of the fraud was potentially so gigantic that they didn’t want to be merely one hundred per cent sure but one thousand per cent sure.” One day, Ziani came across the field study from the car-insurance paper. This data was the fishiest of all, and she sent the file to Data Colada in triumph. On a Zoom call, Simonsohn looked more closely and realized, “Hey, wait a minute. This wasn’t Francesca?” The study had been conducted by Ariely. Later, they opened the file for Gino’s contribution to the same paper, and that, too, seemed incommensurable with real data. It was difficult not to read this as a sign of the field’s blight. Simmons told me, “We were, like, Holy shit, there are two different people independently faking data on the same paper. And it’s a paper about dishonesty.” In 2021, the Data Colada team sent a dossier to Harvard that outlined an array of anomalies in four of Gino’s papers. In her lab study for the car-insurance paper, for example, several observations seemed to be out of order, in a way that suggested someone had moved them around by hand. Those data points, they found, were disproportionately responsible for the result. The team was unable to conceive of a benign explanation for this pattern. They had examined only four papers but noted “strong suspicions” about some of her published data going as far back as 2008. On October 27, 2021, Harvard notified Gino that she was under investigation, and asked her to turn over all “HBS-issued devices” by 5 p.m. that day. According to Gino, the police were called to oversee the process. There had always been some bewilderment about Gino. Multiple people told me they found it abnormal that Gino so closely guarded her data at every step of the process. One former co-author said, “H.B.S. is so hierarchical, it’s like the military, and it was unheard of for the more senior person to do the bitch work and let the junior person have the lofty thoughts. But, then again, if I had done the grunt work, we would not have found significant results.” The networking paper that had originally drawn Ziani’s scrutiny had also seemed dubious to the former graduate student. “There were all kinds of red flags about her sample size, significance, and effect size, and I was, like, ‘No way, I’m done with this person,’ ” she said. Another professor I spoke to didn’t buy one of Gino’s early papers. “When you look at it, it just makes no sense,” he said. But, he added, “even in safe spaces in my world, to bring up that someone is a data fabricator—it’s, like, ‘Our friend John, do you think he might be a cannibal?’ ” Concerns, however, had been raised. In 2012, Lakshmi Balachandra, now a professor at Babson, told Bazerman, Gino’s mentor, that her work seemed too good to be true. Balachandra said, “He basically said to me, ‘Oh, she’s such a hard worker, you could learn a lot from her.’ ” (Bazerman declined to comment about this on the record.) In 2015, a graduate student lodged a complaint against Gino and one of her colleagues, alleging, primarily, that Gino and the colleague created a tense and belittling environment. The more unsettling charge, though, was that Gino had repeatedly refused to share the raw data from their experiments. Once, after the student didn’t hand over an analysis during a long weekend, Gino ran the study herself and produced much stronger results. On multiple occasions, the student voiced concerns to a faculty review board that Gino was playing games with data, but the board was unresponsive. A three-month investigation concluded, in a confidential report, that none of the people involved had acquitted themselves particularly well, but that no action was warranted. “What incredibly low standards Harvard Business School must have to not take concerns about data manipulation seriously,” she wrote. (Harvard declined to comment on personnel matters.) Gino has maintained that she never falsified or fabricated data. In a statement, her lawyer said, “Harvard’s complete and utter disregard for evidence, due process, confidentiality and gender equity should frighten all academic researchers. And Data Colada’s vicious take-down is baseless.” (She declined to comment on other matters on the record.) Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard, told me he is certain that Gino is innocent. “I’m convinced about her because I know her,” he said. “That’s the strongest reason why I can’t believe this has happened.” This spring, Harvard finalized a twelve-hundred-page report that found Gino culpable. As part of its investigation, Harvard obtained the original data file for one of Gino’s studies from a former research assistant. An outside firm compared that to the published data and concluded that it had been altered not only in the ways Data Colada had predicted but in other ways as well. Gino’s defense, in that case, seems to be that the published data are in fact the real data, and that the “original” data are somehow not. Data Colada titled a blog post about her alleged misdeeds “Clusterfake.” According to Gino, she was summoned to the office of the dean, who explained that she would be placed on administrative leave, and that he was instituting perhaps unprecedented proceedings to revoke her tenure. She wept. The dean told her, “You are a capable, smart woman. I am sure you’ll find other opportunities.” That day, journal editors were advised to begin the retraction process. “If we see any of my bear friends, pretend I’m mauling you.” Cartoon by Paul Noth Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop In September, NBC premièred a prime-time procedural called “The Irrational,” starring the “Law & Order” veteran Jesse L. Martin as a behavioral scientist, inspired by Ariely, who helps solve crimes. “Understanding human nature can be a superpower, which is why the F.B.I. ends up calling me,” Martin’s character says. A trade-publication article about the show accidentally described Ariely’s first book as a work of fiction, which inspired Richard Thaler to joke on Twitter, “I have known for years that Dan Ariely made stuff up but now it turns out that it is ok because his book was a novel!” Ariely has also just published a new book, “Misbelief.” In 2020, he writes, the Israeli government sought his help with pandemic-lockdown strategy. “covid in many ways was the highlight of my career,” he told me. He says that he suggested prompting people to wear masks through the altruistic message of “protect others.” He proposed an app-based solution to the rise in domestic violence: children, invited to imagine themselves as superheroes, were encouraged to report disturbances at home. That summer—in an anecdote left out of his book—he told the Israeli press he had suggested that the Army infect soldiers on a base with the coronavirus as an experiment. (Ariely said that his comments were taken out of context and that this was initially someone else’s idea. The former head of the Israel Defense Forces’ personnel directorate confirmed that he had a “very short” conversation with Ariely and “denied his request immediately.”) He writes that he soon became the subject of Israeli covid-denialist conspiracy theories: in a “parallel universe,” he and his “Illuminati friends” were “in cahoots with Bill Gates” to collaborate “with multiple governments to control and manipulate their citizens.” He was called the “chief consciousness engineer” of the “covid-19 fraud.” One conspiracist posted a photo of Ariely’s burns, he wrote in a draft of the book, and said that his suffering had made him “want to take revenge on the world and kill as many people as possible.” Ariely describes late-night hours spent engaging with trolls online, offering, in one case, to provide his tax returns as proof that his government services were pro bono. The book thrums with a newfound pessimism; Ariely seems to have lost faith in his old parlor tricks. “It’s been a very, very tough few years being exposed to the darkest corners of the Internet and the darkest aspects of human nature,” he told me. It never seems to have occurred to him that the vanity and disdain behind a certain kind of social engineering—keeping the buffet treats just out of reach—might exacerbate ambient resentments. It remained unclear, however, how potent those interventions had ever been. As the Data Colada team members learned more about the insurance paper, they found that it had long had an asterisk attached to it. In February, 2011, at the beginning of the collaboration, Ariely had sent an Excel file with the insurance company’s data to Nina Mazar, a frequent co-author, for analysis. She found that the results pointed in the wrong direction—people who had signed at the beginning were less honest. Ariely responded that, in making “the dataset nicer” for her, he had relabelled the condition names, accidentally switching them in the process. He instructed her to switch them back. (When asked recently, Ariely reiterated this account, though he added that someone in his lab might have retyped the condition names for him.) Later, when Bazerman reviewed a draft, he was struck by something else. The over-all numbers suggested that people drove an average of twenty-four thousand miles a year, about twice what he would have expected. When asked about this, Ariely was vague: “We used an older population mostly in Florida—but we can’t tell how we got the data, who was the population (they were all AARP members)—and we also can’t show the forms.” This still seemed odd—why would retirees drive more than commuters? Work on the paper halted. Mazar eventually relayed that the mileage data might have reflected not one but multiple years of driving. Bazerman told me, “It was only then that I kept my name on the paper.” Four years after publication, Bazerman received an e-mail from a guy named Stuart Baserman, who worked at an Internet insurance company, and had noticed the similar surname on the paper. (Bazerman’s wife suggested that he and Baserman take a DNA test. “Cousin Stu” is now Bazerman’s favorite cousin.) Baserman asked if the paper’s results would hold in an online setting. But several experimental attempts failed, as did a subsequent high-powered lab replication of Gino’s initial lab study. The effect just wasn’t there. (The Guatemalan government, with help from the “nudge unit” in the U.K., had also tried to replicate a version of Ariely’s field study with the insurance company, using tax forms, and found no results.) Writing up the failed replication, one of the authors noticed something strange in Ariely’s field-study data: there was a large difference between the baseline mileage—the odometer readings taken prior to the study—of the two cohorts. This seemed like a fatal randomization error. The journal’s editors asked if the authors wanted to retract the original publication. Ariely and Gino were against the idea at the time. Ariely predicted that, if anything, it was the second paper that might have to be retracted. “My strong preference is to keep both papers out and let the science process do its job,” he wrote. He and Mazar were continuing to explore the value of honesty pledges. A former senior researcher at the lab told me, “He assured us that the effect was there, that this was a true thing, and I was convinced he completely believed it.” It didn’t take long for Ziani and Data Colada to determine that the odometer readings were inauthentic. In real life, the distribution of how much people drive looks more or less like a bell curve. This data, however, formed a uniform distribution—the same number of people drove about a thousand miles as did twelve thousand miles as did fifty thousand. Most people, when asked to fill out a form, round off unwieldy numbers to the nearest hundred or thousand. But there were few round numbers in the data set. In a small additional kink, the data were written in two different fonts: Calibri and Cambria. In August, 2021, Data Colada detailed these issues in a blog post. The evidence was overwhelming, and all the paper’s authors agreed immediately that the data were bogus. In statements, each disowned any responsibility. Gino, unaware that she was also being investigated by Data Colada, praised the team for its determination and skill: “The work they do takes talent and courage and vastly improves our research field.” Ariely, apparently taken aback, underscored that he had been the only author who handled the data. He then seemed to imply that the findings could have been falsified only by someone at the insurance company. The insurance company in question, which was revealed to be the Hartford, was surprised to find that it had anything to do with the now infamous study. According to an agreement that Ariely signed in 2007, he was not allowed to refer to any of the company’s data without permission—permission that, according to the company, he had neither sought nor received. (Ariely said that he would never share something without approval.) In the paper, the data had been attributed to a company in the “southeastern United States,” which now smacked of deliberate misdirection. “We have been based in Connecticut, and not the Southeast, for more than two hundred years,” a company spokesperson told me. The Hartford had, in fact, completed a small pilot study at Ariely’s request, but it hadn’t been fruitful: there was no discernible difference between those who signed at the top and those who signed at the end. The company never updated its forms, as Ariely had claimed. In May of 2008, about two months before Ariely discussed the results at Google, the Hartford sent him a single data set. During the next ten months, the company said, Ariely wrote at least five times to request additional odometer data, but it provided nothing. In February of 2009, all contact with Ariely ceased. (Ariely says that he has limited recollection of this time, and no paper trail.) Recently, I obtained the original file of the insurance company’s data. It contains odometer readings for about six thousand cars. These readings are assigned to three different conditions. About half the people were given the company’s “original,” standard form, as a control. (This form couldn’t be tracked down.) On the experimental forms, which have the perfunctory look of a social scientist’s survey materials, a quarter of the participants were instructed to sign a prominent “Pledge of Honesty” at the end, and the remainder to sign one at the beginning. By the time Ariely sent the file to Mazar, three years later, the contents had been transformed. Now the file included about twenty thousand cars, in only two conditions. A comparison of the two files confirms that the data were put through the wringer. About half the cars in the “original” cohort were reassigned to the other conditions, but many appear to have been simply dropped. Among the remaining cars, many never made it to the new file at all, and around half of those that did had their conditions changed. Observations for at least fourteen thousand made-up cars were manufactured, presumably, as Data Colada conjectured, with the help of Excel’s random-number generator—the bulk of which appeared in a different font. According to an unpublished Data Colada analysis, six hundred and fifty of the odometer readings were manually swapped between conditions, which generated the study’s effect. But something went awry along the way, and it wasn’t until Mazar switched the condition labels that the experiment appeared to succeed. Although Ariely told Mazar that he had renamed the conditions, their names are unchanged between the two files. What, then, had he been doing when he was making “the dataset nicer” for her? Ariely has consistently denied any role in the data manipulation. “I care about understanding what makes us tick, and I would never falsify any data on any experiment,” he told me. He disavowed any involvement in the “history” of the data, saying that he merely served as a conduit for the file; he claimed that his co-authors and the members of his lab also had access to it. Investigators of data fraud rarely have recourse to the equivalent of surveillance-camera footage, so the culprit’s identity may never be known with certainty. In September, 2021, the Hartford sent Ariely a cease-and-desist letter, warning him that, if he continued to suggest that “The Hartford had any role in the erroneous research published in the study,” it would pursue legal action. In the past two years, Ariely has nevertheless continued, privately in English and publicly in Hebrew, to implicate a nameless figure at the Hartford. As the former senior researcher told me, “What Dan says is that he thinks it was just some low-level employee who was doing someone a favor at the insurance company, but they don’t know who it was, and they can’t find out. ” This theory is possible; a crooked or inept employee might have taken the file, wangled it to serve Ariely’s hypothesis, and then re-sent it using a non-Hartford e-mail address. It would then have had to escape Ariely’s notice that six thousand observations across three conditions had become twenty thousand observations across only two. (Ariely said that this was the first time he had heard of the third condition, though it was mentioned in the Hartford’s cease-and-desist letter.) Recently, since Gino was put on leave, Ariely has privately speculated that she could have been responsible. He has also mused to colleagues that a lab member could have made the changes. He told Data Colada, however, that he had been the only one to handle the data, and it would have been an enormous risk for a junior researcher to take. (Ariely said that he would never accuse anyone without evidence.) The metadata for the Excel file that he sent to Mazar note that it was created, and last edited, by a user named Dan Ariely. “You can just leave it on that crag, thanks.” Cartoon by Lila Ash Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop Ariely, with his vaudevillian flair and commitment to provocation, had never been a perfect fit for the academy. Throughout his career, he performed studies that no one else would have had the courage, or the recklessness, to pursue. One study put survey questions to subjects who were actively masturbating. (Ariely found that men, in a state of excitement, could imagine being aroused by a twelve-year-old girl, animals, and shoes.) Another looked into people’s attitudes about dildos and other sex toys. He once proposed outfitting service workers with protuberant fake nipples to see how the devices would affect tips. In 2005, Ariely ran an experiment at M.I.T. in which electric shocks were administered to Craigslist volunteers, who had been told that they were testing the efficacy of a painkiller. One of the participants was subjected to more than forty shocks of increasing strength, and broke down in tears. She claims that an assistant in a lab coat told her that she would forfeit payment if she backed out. (The assistant doesn’t recall saying this.) The worst part was the final dehoaxing: in notes from the time, she wrote, “I was informed that there was no pain killer; that they were testing placebos and that all the information that I had been given was fabricated.” If you sympathized with Ariely, this represented a return to the glory days of dashing mid-century social psychology. A less charitable interpretation was that the rules were in place for good reason. “I think he didn’t think very highly of his subjects. And I was young, but I wasn’t that gullible,” the participant told me. She complained, and the university found that Ariely’s assistant lacked human-subjects training, which an administrator called a “very serious violation.” Ariely says that he was suspended from data collection for a year. According to the participant’s e-mails from the time, Ariely called her three or four times a day in the hope that they might come to a private resolution, and eventually offered a two-thousand-dollar payment to make the whole thing go away. (Ariely says that he offered only to buy her “a book on the placebo effect.”) He soon agreed—for his own reasons, he said—to leave M.I.T. (A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on personnel matters.) In an e-mail to some of his collaborators, he wrote, “Attached is the most painful paper in the world. Not so much for the subjects but for me.” The car-insurance study was not the only example of iffy data in Ariely’s work. A few years ago, a team of researchers in Hong Kong looked into a well-known 2004 paper about the differences between social and monetary norms, and found that some numbers didn’t make sense. Ariely could not locate the original data, and conceded that he had used a “strange” statistical approach. The journal appended a formal “Expression of Concern” to the original paper. In 2018, two researchers in the Netherlands coördinated an extensive international effort to replicate Ariely’s Ten Commandments study, enlisting twenty-five labs. Their results found that asking participants to recall the Ten Commandments led, if anything, to a slight increase in dishonesty. (Ariely holds that this replication was imperfect.) The researchers also encountered a medley of inconsistencies in the way that Ariely had described the study over the years. It was an embellishment to claim, even given the data he initially published, that the intervention had eliminated cheating entirely. Ariely maintained that the study had been conducted at U.C.L.A., by a professor named Aimee Drolet Rossi. When I spoke to Rossi, she told me that she had never participated in the study: “I thought, well, first, what a joke! I don’t believe that study, and I certainly didn’t run it.” U.C.L.A. issued a statement saying that the study hadn’t taken place there. Last year, Ariely, having learned that an Israeli television program was investigating the case, wrote to Rossi, “Do you remember who was the RA that was running the data collection sessions in 2004 and 2005?” Rossi replied, “There was none. That’s the point.” Ariely says that the study took place, and it’s possible that it did, in some form. He told me he now remembers that the surveys were collected at U.C.L.A. but processed by an assistant at M.I.T., which might explain the mixup. He could not provide the assistant’s identity. Ariely purported to have learned, from a dental-insurance company, that dentists agree on the presence of a cavity only about half the time. But the insurance company said that it didn’t even collect such data. The Israeli TV documentary, reported by the journalist Itay Rom, dwelled on this allegation, among many others. Ariely was left feeling unfairly persecuted. Yet he has remained almost lackadaisical in his own defense. Ariely has described the use of a modified paper shredder, which allowed him to track when individuals cheated, even when they thought that the evidence had been destroyed. In 2021, researchers expressed doubt that it was even possible to modify a paper shredder in such a way. Ariely’s response was maddeningly fuzzy. On the other hand, a version of the shredder appears to function in a documentary from 2015. Ariely often claims poor recall. In some instances, though, he remains alert to context. In the American press, he has consistently said that he was burned at the age of eighteen, when he presumably would have been in the Israeli Army, by a magnesium flare. In 2008, around the time of the press tour for “Predictably Irrational,” the Times, CNN, and NPR reported that he had been injured in a military exercise, and he never corrected the record. (Ariely said that he has never given inaccurate information about his injury.) But in the Israeli media, which could more easily verify military service, he has said that he was burned in an accident as part of the activities of a youth group. Documents from a court ruling in Israel confirm that the accident occurred in an apartment, where kids were mixing chemicals for a nighttime fire ceremony. In more recent years, he has reconciled these two accounts by saying that he was injured, at seventeen, in a youth-group activity during which a magnesium flare exploded. The former senior researcher said, “How do you swim through that murky area of where is he lying? Where is he stretching the truth? What is he forgetting or misremembering? Because he does all three of those things very consistently. So when it really matters—like with the auto insurance—which of these three things is it?” One of the confounding things about the social sciences is that observational evidence can produce only correlations. To what extent is dishonesty a matter of character, and to what extent a matter of situation? Research misconduct is sometimes explained away by incentives—the publishing requirements for the job market, or the acclaim that can lead to consulting fees and Davos appearances. As one senior faculty member told me, of bridging the academic and corporate worlds, “You see what the money can buy you, you fly business class on work trips. It tickles you in that little place, and you need to have more of it.” The difference between p-hacking and fraud is one of degree. And once it becomes customary within a field to inflate results, the field selects for researchers inclined to do so. The business-school professor told me that this temptation might be more acute among researchers studying the subject: “You’re thinking about it day in and day out and looking at the prevalence of it, and what you’re finding out is normal people cheat on their taxes and cheat on their spouses, so it feels like people are cheating everywhere. “I know this because I fell into the temptation,” she went on. Late one evening, years ago, she was working on a paper in her office. She had run so many studies that had worked, and she had no doubt that the effect she was investigating was real. The paper was key to her career, and she was doubled over with stress. One final study was so close to coming together, but the effect wasn’t quite there. She remembers the moment with absolute clarity. “I thought, Do I tamper with the data?” she said. “We were studying deceit. I finally said to myself, ‘O.K., you can do this bad thing, and then you can put that away in a lockbox in your mind where it never gets opened, and you will never do this again.’ And that is exactly what I did, and I am so mortified.” The paper was a collaboration with Gino. The professor had a breakdown in Gino’s office, and recalled that Gino forgave her instantly, telling her that she was not a bad person. They pulled the paper before publication. “She may well have been doing exactly the same thing,” the professor said. The senior colleague told me he could imagine that Gino, early in a career that felt highly contingent, had been similarly led astray. “Having a job at Harvard is really wonderful, and everybody in the world thinking you’re a genius is pretty darn fun,” he said. “I don’t know when she may have started engaging in fraud, but once she learned to sing to the evidence that way, and get it to play her song, I can imagine that it’s impossible to stop.” As part of one survey, she gave participants gift cards to purchase her book on Amazon and tell her what they thought. (As a former participant wrote on Reddit, “Good pay. Shit book. Sorry to see her go.”) Academic psychologists are generally resistant to clinical interpretations, but it’s difficult not to read a lot of Gino’s later work as the return of the repressed. There’s the title of her 2018 book, “Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life,” or her 2014 paper, now retracted, called “Evil Genius? How Dishonesty Can Lead to Greater Creativity.” The former graduate student told me, “On the one hand, she was this meek Italian woman who used to make polenta for guests—you would never have suspected her. On the other, some of the things she wrote . . . it’s like she’s trying to tell us something.” “Don’t make me change the color temperature from soft white to harsh cool, ’cause things will get ugly.” Cartoon by Lynn Hsu Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop An enduring mystery is that, if Gino faked the data, she seems to have done so on top of a staggering amount of actual work. Sam Swift, a New York City tech executive who worked alongside her at Carnegie Mellon, told me, “It seems way easier to fake research than to do research, so you might want to set yourself up with a relaxed life style—just make up your results and go to the beach.” He continued, “There is a work ethic that intersects with this ethical disorientation that I think is maybe not obvious.” Some observers have complained that Ariely, a charismatic man, has received gentler treatment than Gino. This phenomenon may also reflect the affection of his colleagues. Ariely is unfailingly generous: he gave holiday gifts and paid for extravagant ski trips and beach retreats; he provided a BMW and a twenty-thousand-dollar coffee machine for his lab members to use. When a prospective student told him that Harvard was willing to provide a better financial package, he offered a personal loan for the difference. He created what was, by all accounts, a compelling and fun work environment—foosball and office Segways—where people felt free to indulge their wildest experimental notions. He was, both literally and figuratively, an electrifying presence. Another former postdoc said, “On days he came into the lab, people would be, like, ‘He’s here!’ and go line up at his door, and his door was always open.” John Lynch, one of Ariely’s mentors, said, “My experiences with Dan have been completely positive, and I have never seen anything remotely questionable in his scientific conduct.” A lot of Ariely’s work—on helping people save money, for example—still seems to be valid, and perhaps meaningful. The former doctoral student told me, “The thing that I love about Dan was his ability, whenever you were talking with him, to so quickly distill something into an idea. It’s like you’re talking about the fabric of the universe every time.” Yet some believed that Ariely had always had a tortuous relationship with the truth. When Ariely gained public renown, it seemed as though empirical results became a mere prelude to lively storytelling. The former senior researcher told me that she once heard him talking on the radio about a study his lab had conducted. “His numbers were wrong,” she said. Beyond this, she continued, “he misstates entire findings, he talks about research that doesn’t replicate—he just doesn’t really care that much about the facts. It was, like, ‘No, you can’t make these outrageous claims—you’re a scientist!’ ” (Ariely said that his papers adhere to academic standards, but that he sometimes simplifies how he communicates about his work for a general audience.) Ariely and Gino found that creative people cheat more. And people will cheat and lie more when they see people on their own “team” cheating and lying around them. A month after he sent the modified file to Mazar, Ariely applied for, and later won, an N.I.H. grant to look into dynamics that “may compromise the ethicality of scientific reporting.” Gino co-authored a resulting paper, which focussed on dishonesty more generally, and flagged that people cheat as a misguided act of altruism, to help others who could benefit. Honesty researchers have found that fewer people lie about a coin flip—a binary outcome—than exaggerate the number on a die roll, reporting that they rolled a four when they actually rolled a three, especially if a four had come up on a test roll. Ariely has long used conclusions like these to maintain that most people lie a bit. Other researchers argue that the averages are misleading: most people don’t really lie much, but some people are prone to lie a lot. It now seems as though the “fudge factor” was less of an explanation of a phenomenon than a license for it—yet another just-so story about why a little deceit isn’t so bad after all. “I’ll tell you what the research on dishonesty says, but all that came from Dan and Francesca!” the former senior researcher said. “It’s like everything we know about this situation comes from the data that might have been fabricated.” Ariely has told me that, “because of my injury and pain in my hands,” it has been decades since he processed data himself. It’s true that those who have worked with Ariely in the years since the car-insurance paper have had a hard time reconciling the fraud allegations with the fact that none of them ever saw him get anywhere close to data. In a 2013 interview, Ariely talked about how much he had enjoyed drinking a glass of wine while analyzing data for a study published in 2008. But by the time he arrived at Duke, a former lab employee told me, “Dan was way too famous to worry about the publication process. There were papers I could barely get him to read.” And, according to several people I spoke to, the work completed by his lab in the past decade or more has been thorough and robust. He hired people who were serious about upstanding research practices; guidelines were instituted to, for example, keep raw data and edited data separate. Ariely sometimes spoke about a “Ulysses contract,” a way to feel a temptation without giving in to it. “Maybe this was his version of binding himself to the mast,” the former senior researcher said. “I don’t know if it’s true, but it’s consistent. There are people who are the lifetime fraudsters, and then maybe there are people who had a fraud phase and then recovered and never did it again.” The former senior researcher explained that Ariely was well aware that he lacked an inclination to tell the truth at all costs. Perhaps, she continued, he had accepted safeguards to protect himself from his own worst impulses—an example, in other words, of taking his own scholarship seriously. “He encourages good data practices in other people and really cares about the right things. If Dan met another Dan, he wouldn’t trust that Dan.” In August, Gino filed a twenty-five-million-dollar lawsuit, claiming that she had been defamed by Data Colada and wrongly terminated by Harvard. (A Harvard spokesperson said, “Professor Gino has raised allegations in her lawsuit that Harvard vigorously and vehemently denies. We believe that Harvard ultimately will be vindicated.”) Even if the defamation counts are dismissed soon, Gino’s suit will cost Data Colada tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. The research community has rallied behind the members of Data Colada; a group of colleagues set up a GoFundMe on their behalf, which raised almost two hundred thousand dollars in twenty-four hours. Ariely’s lab has lost two of its biggest funders, and morale is low. Although he remains brash and witty in conversation, he also has an aspect of melancholic self-pity. He wrote to me, in reference to the confusion around the Ten Commandments experiment, “When I was thinking of how to promote Misbelief, I had the idea of creating a misbelief and exposing it on the day of the book’s publication, but maybe this is the way of karma to give me this anyway.” In May of 2022, according to a confidential document, Duke completed an initial inquiry. Investigators concluded that there was “sufficient evidence of the alleged misconduct to warrant a full investigation.” (Ariely and a Duke spokesperson declined to comment on the existence of an investigation.) Joe Simmons has been working on a blog post, which Data Colada will probably never publish, called “The Fraud Is Not the Story.” He notes, at the outset, that there is “a very large body of behavioral research that is true and important.” But, he says, there is also a lot of work that is “completely divorced from reality, populated with findings about human beings that cannot be true.” In the past few years, some eminent behavioral scientists have come to regret their participation in the fantasy that kitschy modifications of individual behavior will repair the world. George Loewenstein, a titan of behavioral science and a co-author of Ariely’s masturbation paper, has refashioned his research program, conceding that his own work might have contributed to an emphasis on the individual at the expense of the systemic. “This is the stuff that C.E.O.s love, right?” Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago, told me. “It’s cutesy, it’s not really touching their power, and pretends to do the right thing.” At the end of Simmons’s unpublished post, he writes, “An influential portion of our literature is effectively a made-up story of human-like creatures who are so malleable that virtually any intervention administered at one point in time can drastically change their behavior.” He adds that a “field cannot reward truth if it does not or cannot decipher it, so it rewards other things instead. Interestingness. Novelty. Speed. Impact. Fantasy. And it effectively punishes the opposite. Intuitive Findings. Incremental Progress. Care. Curiosity. Reality.” The Data Colada guys have always believed that the replication crisis might be better understood as a “credibility revolution” in which their colleagues would ultimately choose rigor. The end result might be a field that’s at once more boring and more reputable. That sanguine attitude has been tested by a cascade of corruption. In the weeks after the Gino revelations, some of her co-authors have audited their work, although Gino did not provide original data files for comparison. They wanted to figure out who had collected and analyzed which data, and to exonerate the innocent—especially young people, whose work for the job market or tenure might have been fatally tainted. In one paper, which had several co-authors, data of the apparently unnatural variety were newly uncovered. Although the details aren’t fully clear, Gino seems to have had nothing to do with it. The data may have been altered by another professor. The suspicions have been reported to the university. ♦ Published in the print edition of the October 9, 2023, issue, with the headline “Big Little Lies.” New Yorker Favorites A hookup app for the emotionally mature.

(newyorker.com) 194 points by chrisaycock 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite147 comments loeg 20 hours agohttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;ifxn6 neilv 15 hours agoprev> When she expressed her doubts, the adviser snapped at her, “Don’t ever say that!”I don&#x27;t know whether the advisor was referring to collegial decorum in how good faith research is discussed, or more like whisper networks about bad faith that are impolitic or scared to speak aloud.But I did actually once get a snap response like that. I was chatting with another grad student, who&#x27;d mentioned a student who&#x27;d just arrive, who&#x27;d be working for Prof. X. I hadn&#x27;t worked with Prof. X, but I happened to see them treat multiple students poorly over time, belittling the student, disciplining them in front of groups of others, giving them non-research chores like a personal assistant rather than a research assistant, not letting them pursue their research, etc., so I blurted out, concerned, \"Oh no!\", and that X was a bad advisor.This other grad student surprised me by snapping back at me, sternly, \"You shouldn&#x27;t say that!\", and something about reputations. That other grad student&#x27;s parent was a prominent academic, so I figured they were admonishing me in some decorum that they were brought up in, and which they knew better than me.It might&#x27;ve been weeks later, that same grad student came back to me, apologetically, and spoke with surprise, of how miserable the new student was, once they realized the career disaster that they&#x27;d stumbled into.Epilogue: A long time later, that grad student, who&#x27;d admonished me and then apologized, contacted me about a different professor, because they knew a prospective new student of that professor, they had some suspicions, and they thought that I might know something. The truth was much worse than they suspected, and the student fled after hearing only a little, in vague terms.BTW, there&#x27;s apparently a lot of all kinds of poor behavior, but the people doing it are almost never cliched evil, IME. For example, a couple times I saw Prof. X do something kind, and I think probably they had something like a very stern taskmaster upbringing that caused their other side. There was also another one, who was kind to me, but I later learned that they were decidedly unkind to some others, and were actually nudged out. And one of the most body-count professors I saw was actually genuinely warm and charismatic and humble in some ways, and I don&#x27;t think they realized that they seemed to have emotional&#x2F;cognitive problems that they let kill other people&#x27;s careers in an awful way. Off-the-record gossip with grad students and (later) professors will tell you of all sorts of other misbehavior, especially by people who aren&#x27;t all bad, but very driven and pressured. (Raging narcissist&#x2F;psycho, however, seems relatively rare, or their trail of bodies doesn&#x27;t survive long enough to complain about it. Maybe the worse people tend to go for careers with more money and power?) And, back to this article, I once met with Ariely, and he came across as empathetic, down-to-earth, and of goodwill, so -- iff it turns out that he&#x27;s found to have done something academically dishonest -- again, that would seem like a bit of human frailty, in a more wholesome larger picture.(Note: I&#x27;ve been a grad student a few places, and have talked with people at countless other places, so am not calling out a particular school or person. A lot of people have seemed paranoid about saying anything at all, myself included, so please don&#x27;t speculate, or I think that would have even more of a chilling effect than already exists.) reply rossdavidh 14 hours agoparentThis is exactly the result when you have a large power differential. The people in authority may not be intrinsically mean or evil, but they&#x27;re not getting the proper amount of feedback about their own behavior, and the reason is that they have too much power and the people they&#x27;re dealing with have too little. Everything about the grad school (esp. Ph.D.) power structure is wrong, giving the student virtually not recourse and the advisor way too much authority. reply Nevermark 6 hours agorootparentExactly.Power differentials experienced too long can create character flaws, even when originally used constructively and with all good intentions.I saw the cliche of a professor taking a students original and significant work, done without their direction, and quickly presenting it as mostly theirs, after adding their critical professorial value by waving the result around for their colleagues to congratulate them on.The nice short paper that resulted was notable for an author list starting with the professor, followed by at least a dozen of the professors colleagues, and ending with the student who had solved the problem whole by themselves.I also watched a professor&#x27;s highly evolved and useful ability to dodge and protect his team from endless administrative performative&#x2F;mata&#x2F;made-up work in a university department translate badly to a business partial-ownership situation where their slippery ability to shirk work onto others gave them strong leverage over a project. Leverage that had much worse indirect effects than the obvious direct one of not contributing a lot.This was someone with many great qualities, but also an internalized entitlement and talent for control. reply m463 8 hours agorootparentprevThis reminds me of someone who was athletic, played sports and had some strong opinions about them.Basically, she liked sports where merit counted and disliked others.For example, if you&#x27;re playing a game with a score, or running against a clock, the sport tends to have a lot less BS compared to say gymnastic or diving competitions where you impress judges.I think the trick in academia is optimizing for something similar. reply dblack12705 19 hours agoprevIn case anyone hasn’t read it, the Datacolada article demonstrating Ariely committed fraud is a great read and extremely convincing.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datacolada.org&#x2F;98 reply dang 13 hours agoparentDiscussed at the time:Evidence of fraud in an influential field experiment about dishonesty - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28210642 - Aug 2021 (51 comments)(Lots more related links at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37719476) reply nkurz 19 hours agoparentprevGreat article.

Defending oneself in court is time-consuming and expensive regardless of the merits of the lawsuit – as First Amendment lawyer Ken White put it to Vox , “The process is the punishment.” Targets of scientific criticism can thus use the legal system to silence their critics.At present, Leif, Joe, and Uri do not have pro bono representation. The lawyers they’ve spoken to currently estimate that their defense could cost anywhere between $50,000 and $600,000 (depending on how far the lawsuit progresses). Their employers have so far only agreed to pay part of the legal fees. Defending science requires defending legitimate scientific criticism against legal bullying.Edit: I initially wrote that they met their GoFundMe goal of $350,000, which is true. However, I’m not sure why they set their goal to only $350k when they mention that legal costs could skyrocket to $600,000 which they have not met reply tqi 17 hours agoparentprev(Not an excuse in any way)This data was so shoddily faked that I have a hard time believing someone did this with an intention to deceive. Uniform distribution with a hard cutoff at 50K?? reply a_bonobo 8 hours agorootparentIn science we only catch the sloppy fakers, we don&#x27;t catch the &#x27;good&#x27; fakers.There was a similar case a while ago in spider biology: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-022-02156-2Pruitt had several influential spider biology papers out and when others failed to replicate and dug into the Supplementary Data, they also found lazy patterns.>When Laskowski dug into data sets that Pruitt had provided for the study, she was shocked to find stretches of data that seemed to have been duplicated, to represent findings for multiple spiders. This questionable data helped to bolster a long-unproven theory that repeated social interactions in a group of spiders cause individuals to behave predictably.So yeah, who knows how much scientific fraud there actually is; I haven&#x27;t seen a case of fraud where the data was convincingly faked, which means that these cases are hard to detect or hard to prove. reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you fake and get away with it you’re already admitting to a type of laziness, so it expands y til finally you are faking it so lazily that you get caught.Faking data realistically is almost as hard as getting it honestly. I know, I “expanded the data pool” for my eight grade science project. reply bonoboTP 15 hours agorootparentExcept the \"it\" in \"getting it\" is a significant or even bombastic and sexy finding. There&#x27;s no reliable way to generate those, it&#x27;s not just about hardness. The more correct and meticulous you are with your data, the more it will generally tell you that the bombastic claim is false. The more meticulous and effortful you are about faking, the likelier it will slip by.Your suggestion only works in the simulated science, like school projects where you are retracing the footsteps of past successful scientists, to verify an already known result. There putting in more work will reveal that effect more and cleaner, because your teacher already knew how the thing works in the first place. This is totally unlike real science where we confront the frontier of the unknown. reply tqi 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah that is fair, but it&#x27;s mind bogglingly lazy&#x2F;brazen. How much more effort is it have taken to just take an average of a few RAND calls to get a normal distribution instead of a uniform one? Did they not know the central limit theorem?? reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentprevThat somehow loops around to becoming an interesting 8’th grade science project.Do an easy experiment once correctly, then again with falsified data. Present the results side-by-side. Ask people if they can tell you which is which. Present have a bit on what sort of statistics could catch your faked data set. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentYeah, I did the simplistic thing of decide a question and an answer that sounded good; ran five or so tests, and then extrapolated additional sets based on that.In my defense I would have run more tests had I started when I should have :) reply User23 5 hours agorootparentprev> I “expanded the data pool” for my eight grade science project.My teachers warned against this and told us they would catch us if we tried. reply 77pt77 15 hours agorootparentprevAmazing that whoever faked this data was ever able to get to harvard let alone get tenure.It&#x27;s just so laughably faked it&#x27;s not even funny. reply rdtsc 19 hours agoprev> In statements, each disowned any responsibility. Gino, unaware that she was also being investigated by Data Colada, praised the team for its determination and skill: “The work they do takes talent and courage and vastly improves our research field.” Ariely, apparently taken aback, underscored that he had been the only author who handled the data. He then seemed to imply that the findings could have been falsified only by someone at the insurance company.The insurance company then showed their data and it wasn’t falsified. That’s just amazing. They both falsified data, and when caught, pointed at each other.Gino was fired but Ariely kept his job then sued Data Colada.She had claimed it was misogyny and discrimination. She may be right in respect to how she was treated compared to Ariely.Was it still worth cheating for both of them? Money-wise, absolutely! Add up all their book fees and speaking fees that they’ll never have to repay back. They can already retire comfortably.EDIT: Gino wasn&#x27;t fired. She was placed on administrative leave. Revocation of tenure was only implied as a possibility. reply 6502nerdface 16 hours agoparentI used to work at Two Sigma Investments, and back in 2012-2014 or so, after the publication of his \"irrationality\" books (before the ones about dishonesty), Dan Ariely gave a well-attended talk at the company headquarters (I wonder what his speaking fee was!).I remember thinking even then that there was something off about his arguments, and I&#x27;m not surprised that he has since been exposed as a likely fraud. For example, throughout his talk, he kept making the point that when someone made a self-serving claim or argument, he would \"hold on to his wallet,\" making an analogy to pickpockets. He then concluded his talk with a transparently self-serving argument that the importance of studying irrationality was growing over time because (as just one example, I suppose), the share of deaths attributed to preventable causes (self-inflicted, etc.) was increasing over the decades, making it sound like society is becoming more irrational. This seemed very weak to me, because that&#x27;s exactly what you would expect if civilization is making progress over time... if science and technology keep eliminating the exogenous causes of death, over time we should be left with just the endogenous ones. Anyway, I thought of raising my hand to ask if I should reach for my own wallet, but was too young and nervous. reply tycho-newman 6 hours agorootparentI, too, saw through Dan Ariely&#x27;s dog and pony show. I just didn&#x27;t want to bring it up because people would think I was just showing off my clearly superior intellect. reply bachmeier 19 hours agoparentprev> Add up all their book fees and speaking fees that they’ll never have to repay back. They can already retire comfortably.Don&#x27;t forget their faculty salaries. Duke is a private institution, so we don&#x27;t have access to his salary, but absolute minimum Ariely makes 400K (and probably way more). You don&#x27;t leave MIT for a chaired professorship at Duke unless it comes with a very, very hefty salary. 25 years of a salary like that will by itself provide you with a good retirement. You don&#x27;t need to get the media attention of Ariely to benefit from fraud. reply dharmon 18 hours agorootparentNot to mention the hefty consulting fees he’s been getting for years from places like Google. IMO those probably dwarf his faculty salary and money from books. reply cycomanic 14 hours agorootparentprevSalaries in academia are hardly a strong incentive. It&#x27;s been a long time since a professor salary would put you anywhere near the top of the middle class. Especially if one considers the time and risk that you spend at lower rungs of the academic ladder. Typical professor salaries are in the mid 100ks, and you only get to that point after a PhD and several years as postdoc working 60+ hours a week for maybe $45k.If your main incentive is financial you would be much better off to go into industry, a starting salary straight out of undergrad I a consulting or software development role is on the same level as a professor salary. reply User23 5 hours agorootparentThe incentive is that the salary for a tenured professor is a sinecure. At that point you can just produce bullshit and maybe cash in on speaking fees and publishing. Source: TFA. But that&#x27;s loserthink.The freedom to fuck around and (probably) never find out is considerable. And if you&#x27;re actually inclined to apply yourself that 100-150k a year plus your grad students basically means you&#x27;re your own y combinator year after year every year. Tenure is HUGE. It&#x27;s worth way more than the equivalent salary in industry. reply michtzik 11 hours agorootparentprev> You don&#x27;t leave MIT for a chaired professorship at Duke unless ...Or maybe he was kicked out of MIT? ;) reply mrosett 8 hours agorootparentThat’s the rumor. reply 77pt77 15 hours agorootparentprevGlassdoor [1] seems to imply full professors at MIT make around 200K.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glassdoor.com&#x2F;Salary&#x2F;MIT-Professor-Salaries-E288... reply bachmeier 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not really relevant. Ariely was an economics professor in the business school at MIT. He then got an offer as a chaired professor at Duke (certainly with a big raise). Economics professors at top schools have very high salaries relative to most fields, but chaired professors with big media profiles get way more than that.If you want to see what I&#x27;m talking about, here&#x27;s the data for the first full professor of economics at Michigan that popped into my head. His salary last year was $466K:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umsalary.info&#x2F;index.php?FName=&LName=shapiro&Yea...That&#x27;s normal for the elite schools. There were rumors 10 years ago that Chicago made a 7-figure offer (denied by the department head at the time).Edit: To be clear, this is what wealthy schools pay. Salaries fall quickly once you exit the top 15 or 20. reply zetazzed 5 hours agorootparentFrancesca Gino made $1M&#x2F;year from HBS alone:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;harvard-professor-raking-over.... reply 77pt77 14 hours agorootparentprevSo those glassdoor numbers are completely wrong?Because nothing there reaches 300K.Is the disparity between disciplines that high? reply bachmeier 14 hours agorootparent> Is the disparity between disciplines that high?At the wealthiest schools, yes. 200K is a high salary in many disciplines.

Surely that offers a good deal of insulation for him, without needing to play the discrimination card too. reply nostromo 16 hours agorootparentGiven that he’s famous for presenting faked data, his previous accomplishments aren’t real and shouldn’t get him off the hook. reply andrewflnr 12 hours agorootparentGP is not attempting to exonerate Ariely, but blunt the accusation of sexism on the part of everyone else (who treated him differently from Gino). reply latency-guy2 17 hours agoparentprevI think it&#x27;s misogynistic to think that women can do no wrong. Gino certainly can stuff her shit where she found it. reply jstarfish 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if her claims have any real merit but I suspect it&#x27;s become part of the unofficial vindictive employee playbook to make a discrimination complaint anytime you&#x27;re facing termination for cause.Everyone who isn&#x27;t a straight white male is a member of at least one protected class. The most we can do is play the whistleblower-retribution card, even if it&#x27;s a farce.It appears to be worth attempting-- it costs you nothing and shakes the employer down for a quick and favorable settlement to shut you up. I&#x27;ve seen it done by two ex-employees in the last three years, and there was a recent news article about a woman at some insurer who was submitting timecards for hours worked while caught redhanded as AWOL...she immediately cried discrimination too. reply bakuninsbart 12 hours agoparentprevAriely&#x27;s book \"Predictably irrational\" was an absolutely delightful, short, pop-science read. It so clearly and usefully condensed science into tidbits you could sprinkle into intellectual conversation or incorporate into your lifestyle.

In June 2023, they published a series of blog posts (linked below) raising concerns about the integrity of the data in four papers co-authored by Harvard Business School (HBS) Professor Francesca Gino. They waited to publish these blog posts until after the HBS’s investigation concluded, with HBS placing Professor Gino on leave and requesting retractions for the four papers. In early August 2023, Professor Gino filed a lawsuit for defamation against Harvard University, and against Leif, Joe, and Uri personally, claiming 25 million dollars in damages. reply 77pt77 15 hours agoparentprev> They both falsified data, and when caught, pointed at each other.Why is that amazing?It&#x27;s just the default go to.

What theories had to be rewritten? What revisions did we have to make to our understanding of the human mind?> Basically none, as far as I can tell. The universities where Stapel worked released a long report cataloging all of his misdeeds, and the part called “Impact of the fraud” (section 3.7 if you&#x27;re following along at home) details all sorts of reputational harm: students, schools, co-authors, journals, and even psychology itself all suffer from their association with Stapel. It says nothing about the scientific impact—the theories that have to be rolled back, the models that have to be retired, the subfields that are at square one again. And looking over Stapel&#x27;s retracted work, it&#x27;s because there are no theories, models, or subfields that changed much at all. The 10,000+ citations of his work now point nowhere, and it makes no difference.> As a young psychologist, this chills me to my bones. Apparently is possible to reach the stratosphere of scientific achievement, to publish over and over again in “high impact” journals, to rack up tens of thousands of citations, and for none of it to matter. Every marker of success, the things that are supposed to tell you that you&#x27;re on the right track, that you&#x27;re making a real contribution to science—they might mean nothing at all. So, uh, what exactly am I doing?It&#x27;s kinda like finding out an athlete has been cheating. You probably want to throw away any of their inspirational talk, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the rest of your life because it was just a sport to begin with. Somebody was gonna win, somebody was gonna lose, and it matters a whole lot to the players (and fans) but that&#x27;s it. Except worthwhile science is supposed to actually matter whether it&#x27;s true or false. reply Roark66 18 hours agoparentAnd that is why I don&#x27;t consider psychology as a whole a science. It simply isn&#x27;t. Imagine if something like this happened in physics, or mathematics. It would have huge impacts on all work that cited it. In psychology, not so much.Does this mean psychology is useless? I don&#x27;t think so, there have been many people helped by application of psychology, but the sooner we take it out of the same category as for example mathematics or medicine the sooner we can move on. I&#x27;d love to be convinced otherwise that we as humanity have a chance of understanding ourselves to the point where we can draw meaningful conclusions about human happiness or other feelings&#x2F;states of mind. However, I think at this stage our chance of accomplishing this is similar to a medieval blacksmith doing a successful root canal treatment on of his dental patients.I&#x27;m definitely looking at the advancements in AI with hope that perhaps replicating our own thought processes in machines will enable us to study them more systematically and to understand them, but these are still early days. reply cycomanic 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s popular here (and in other more \"technically\" inclined communities) to dunk on the \"soft sciences\", but the hard sciences also had their share of fraud cases (the Schön revelations being some of the most prominent). The discovery of Schön&#x27;s fraud also didn&#x27;t lead to theories suddenly being rewritten. This is simply a misunderstanding of how science works and the contribution&#x2F;impact of a single scientist. In the end sure some minor directions will be impacted, people will see conclusions still hold, but overall theories will only marginally be impacted.Something only becomes well accepted theory if it can be reproduced again and again, fraud will come out eventually. That is the beauty of the scientific process. reply lofatdairy 12 hours agorootparentDefinitely agree that this is not just a psychology issue[^1].I&#x27;m not quite as optimistic about the implications, however. The way academia operates is very trust heavy. This makes sense, no lab can be experts in all fields of study, and perform every experiment themselves. If something doesn&#x27;t work for you, the default assumption is that something in your system is incompatible with the previous work, or you&#x27;re just doing something wrong. So sometimes it takes quite a concerted effort to identify bad science, because legitimate work can be nudged towards supporting + compatible with this bad science. You basically have no choice but to have basis in what is widely believed to be true if you want grant funding or papers published.From a purely theoretical&#x2F;knowledge standpoint, I think I agree - the truth will eventually be accepted. But in fields like biology, this can be at the cost of drugs not working, actually promising avenues not explored, wasted resources - tangible harms.[^1]: E.g. the recent Alzheimer&#x27;s controversy, Stanford&#x27;s president scandal, 5-HTTLPR, etc. Ironically, Ronald Fisher argues that Gregor Mendel&#x27;s work, the foundation of modern biology, to be essentially fraudulent despite being correct. reply thaumasiotes 5 hours agorootparent> Ironically, Ronald Fisher argues that Gregor Mendel&#x27;s work, the foundation of modern biology, to be essentially fraudulent despite being correct.There&#x27;s nothing weird about that.

No.Does the fact that all the problems are fraudulent mean that the math they&#x27;re meant to teach you is wrong? No. The math is right; that&#x27;s why the problems were written up the way they were. reply graphe 12 hours agorootparentprevThe soft \"sciences\" aren&#x27;t science if they aren&#x27;t reproducible.

It is fraudulent. It is religion except backed by non reproductive \"science\".

We&#x27;ve noticed a lot of dodgy papers because of the broad public interest in the field and the overlap with the much more rigorous field of psychiatry, but I have no doubt that there are scores of Stapels and Arielys in most fields of research.In physics, we&#x27;ve seen an immense amount of recent controversy over LK-99; while the material might have some interesting properties, it is almost certainly not the room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor that Lee and Kim claim it to be. How many totally bogus physics papers might be lurking in the literature, ignored and mostly un-cited? We don&#x27;t know, because most of those papers don&#x27;t make sufficiently interesting or exciting claims to inspire a raft of replication attempts. For all our aspirational beliefs about the scientific method and the power of peer review, most papers are subject to little more than a superficial sniff test.There are plausible reasons to believe that psychology might have a worse misconduct problem than other fields, but the idea that psychology is uniquely broken is, I fear, simply wishful thinking. reply gr__or 12 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallpotatoes.paulbloom.net&#x2F;p&#x2F;psychology-is-ok reply bakuninsbart 18 hours agorootparentprevIt already is in a completely different category than mathematics; mathematics is a humanity while psychology is a science. Do the standards need to be improved in psychology? Almost certainly, and this rings true for most quantitative social sciences. But research should be evaluated on its own, not by field. There is still a lot of good, solid knowledge being produced through the scientific methods in these fields. We just generally lack the unifying theories we know from eg. physics, because the subject matter is so much more complicated, and the field is much younger. And in a lot of ways, the way academia works is not conductive to producing high-quality, impactful research in these fields. reply whimsicalism 18 hours agorootparentMathematics is not a humanities, it is a formal science, unless you are using some very idiosyncratic definition. reply beojan 17 hours agorootparentMathematics isn&#x27;t a humanity but it isn&#x27;t a science either.

Dan Ariely&#x27;s backstory of being a teenage burn victim somehow factors into his research as adding credibility.

Flam, Columnist Don’t Worry About Global Population Collapse Most demographers now predict that humanity will plateau, not drastically decline. September 30, 2023 at 8:00 AM EDT By F.D. Flam F.D. Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering science. She is host of the “Follow the Science” podcast. Where’d everybody go? Photographer: Jared Wickerham/Getty Images The world’s massive human population is levelling off. Most projections show we’ll hit peak humanity in the 21st century, as people choose to have smaller families and women gain power over their own reproduction. This is great news for the future of our species. And yet alarms are sounding. While environmentalists have long warned of a planet with too many people, now some economists are warning of a future with too few. For example, economist Dean Spears from the University of Texas has written that an “unprecedented decline” in population will lead to a bleak future of slower economic growth and less innovation.

Most places don’t pay well enough to afford daycare. Women want careers too. Few countries have comprehensive parental leave.Can’t complain about less kids and have policies which make raising kids a risky financial and life decision.We gotta do a better job at providing for the kids we already have. reply BenFranklin100 4 hours agoparentHousing is artificially expensive: zoning limits the construction of denser housing thus leading to a supply shortage and high prices. Most of America is under-built and the housing problem would go away if American cities were upzoned to a gentle six-story, mixed-use density.Your points about how we must do better to make having kids less financially risky are excellent however. Better parental leave and tax incentives would help. reply Beldin 2 hours agorootparentHouse prices in the USA have less impact on the total world population than you might think. Similarly, the number of people living in a situation where having children is a smart financial decision for the future is a lot larger than you might think.Remember this [1] picture? Related: the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to explode further. Average age there is, according to the google infobox [2], 18.8.In other words: US-internal policies are not going to move the needle on world population much.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;a&#x2F;a3&#x2F;Valeriep...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=average+age+sub+saharan+afri... reply dcow 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, but.If you’re looking for an excuse to not have a kid, you’ll find one. There’s a cultural element too. reply somedude895 3 hours agorootparentI agree. Most people I know who don‘t want to have kids it’s primarily because they don‘t want to give up their lifestyle. Having a child means less money, less free time and less individualism.Our priorities have changed but some want to be able to have everything without compromise. reply tetris11 1 hour agorootparent> because they don‘t want to give up their lifestyleAlmost. They want the same lifestyles that their parents had growing up. I do blame the housing market for this. If you rent for the rest of your life, nothing will stop your rent from increasing and your wages from stagnating, and those two lines will cross at some point. With kids it&#x27;s sooner. The only security you can have is to own a home to guard against any future price gouging. reply pydry 59 minutes agorootparentprevLike the entitlement that comes with wanting to own the roof over their head? reply IshKebab 2 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s true, but you can&#x27;t just dismiss the fact that modern life (primarily the fact that both parents work) makes having children extremely difficult.It&#x27;s getting better - especially since the pandemic - but most jobs are not remotely flexible enough to deal with school hours or sick children. Nursery is insanely expensive in most countries. I really think a mortgage style option would make a lot of sense here because it&#x27;s a ton of money for a short time. Or, just make it free like some countries do (and the Tories pretended to do in the UK).Life still assumes only one parent will work. Our school regularly schedules meetings and events in the middle of the day at short notice and expects that will be fine. reply lnsru 3 hours agorootparentprevDon’t forget, that having kids is really hard. They cost time, money and require support from living environment. There must be kindergartens with sane opening times, not until 2 PM. There must be supportive employers allowing home office on 2-3 days. Especially when kids are sick. Spoiler alert: before school kids are sick at least once a month. Housing is a real problem, but one can have kids in cheaper area too. There is not need to live in super expensive big city center.Having no kids is simple very easy life without any bigger problems. reply Earw0rm 3 hours agorootparentOr, it must be possible to support some kind of reasonable family life on less than two full time incomes.** This does not mean \"exactly one full time income\", aka \"woman, get in the kitchen\". There are many desirable options between \"one traditional full time male earner\" and \"two people working a combined 90 hours of paid employment\". Also doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean all the trappings of an affluent Western lifestyle, big suburban home with two new cars on the drive, foreign vacations every year etc. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparentprevThis really is the crux of the issue, I&#x27;ve found. There is, at least for me and many others, simply no tangible, concrete reason to have kids, beyond the nebulous sense of pride and accomplishment, which is not necessarily always the case (postpartum depression or the lack of people who openly talk about regretting having kids as that&#x27;s not socially acceptable). reply david-gpu 1 hour agorootparent> There is, at least for me and many others, simply no tangible, concrete reason to have kids, beyond the nebulous sense of pride and accomplishmentI used to feel like that... until I had children. It is an experience that can&#x27;t be understood until you live through it. We can use words to try and describe it, but to a non-parent it will sound like a \"nebulous sense of pride and accomplishment\" because of how far removed it is from their past experiences. It&#x27;s like trying to use words to explain music to a person who has never felt it. reply satvikpendem 1 hour agorootparentYes, but having a child is not a reversible decision, so having a child just to see what it feels like is something that I would not risk doing, especially if the risk is non-zero. reply david-gpu 1 hour agorootparentI used to think like that, too. If you ever have a child, you will understand, like so many of us before. reply satvikpendem 59 minutes agorootparentAgain, just because you understood doesn&#x27;t mean I or others necessarily will. It seems to be just like religious belief, in a way, only the risk is much higher and more concrete than Pascal&#x27;s Wager. reply david-gpu 37 minutes agorootparentAll I&#x27;m saying is that you are not alone. Many of us have had the same doubts and found the experience to be (very) positive.You won&#x27;t find answers to this by trying to rationalize it, because you can&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like until you experience it, if you ever do.You do you, my friend. I could no possibly have less at stake here, one way or another.Have a nice day. reply jbombadil 27 minutes agorootparentprevThats a big bet. Hope that you will get to some enlightenment by doing something that is irreversible, life changing and veeeery expensive.It’s like buying a 1M dollar without seeing it and having someone tell you “you’ll love it when you cross the threshold because I did with my house!”Not saying it didn’t happen to you or your experience is invalid. But extrapolating your experience to everyone else feels dismissive about the doubts they are expressing. reply throwaway2037 2 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]the lack of people who openly talk about regretting having kids as that&#x27;s not socially acceptableI am always surprised when I see people post about the regret of having children. You are right: It is pretty rare. reply apsurd 3 hours agorootparentprevno other reason to have kids? we&#x27;re biologically programmed to have kids. i don&#x27;t have kids myself, but I&#x27;m shocked at how intellectual you&#x27;re coloring is of the situation.Procreating is our only purpose, as a life form. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentFor many species, having offspring is a no-op. The Luna moth literally has no mouth (and I&#x27;m not sure if it must scream, either), so when it procreates, it creates yet more offspring that also have no mouths. The moth does not do anything while it exists beyond procreating, as there is nothing it can do; in other words, it existing is simply a no-op, in the computer science sense.Therefore, even if procreating is our only purpose, we can still ponder what the point of doing so actually is. Since we are intellectual beings, we can decide whether it&#x27;s a logical decision or not, so that we don&#x27;t end up no-ops either. I&#x27;ve seen friends and family members where kids are born to teen parents, who then have kids as teens, who then have kids as teens, and so on. Those are the equivalent of the moths, those teens have not had the chance to grow and achieve more, they were simply procreating to procreate, and they could not get out of poverty as their entire life was only dedicated to sustenance. Personally, their lives were very sad to me.Finally, do not fall for the fallacy of appealing to nature, as just because something is natural does not mean it is moral. Many animals will forcefully mate with one another or eat their prey alive, that does not mean that humans must do the same. So too for procreation.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Appeal_to_nature reply apsurd 2 hours agorootparentGood feedback! my reply is mainly calling out your \"pride and accomplishment\" claim as the only other reason to have kids.I agree that there are plenty of reasons to not have kids. and also that plenty of people probably shouldn&#x27;t have kids from a moral calculus; though importantly it&#x27;s not our calculus to dictate.In any case i still say that having kids for the sake of humanity is a Just reason to have kids. Problems and all. Humanity is basically a huge injection of problems and chaos. What else are we going to do. reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentprevNot everyone is as primitive. reply chrisandchris 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, sure.I&#x27;m not sure I want to give up my landhouse for a six-story building in which I share a place with hundreds... just because of \"having children\". reply sambazi 2 hours agorootparentjust be glad your parents chose to err on the side of life reply Thiez 1 hour agorootparentHonestly, why? reply gmd63 2 hours agorootparentprevHousing is expensive because speculators use it to get rich.You will not stop the artificially high cost of housing without addressing that root cause. reply zeroCalories 2 hours agorootparentSpeculators are only able to speculate because at the end of the day there are people that are willing to pay that much. Even if you completely decomodify housing you&#x27;ll just end up finding new ways to ration it if you don&#x27;t address the supply issue. reply hiAndrewQuinn 5 hours agoparentprevFinland is a good place to move to fix most of these, if you&#x27;re willing to live with the tradeoffs.And yet, it seems like the slowdown is hitting us as hard as anyone... so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually that. reply l33t7332273 5 hours agorootparentI think a big part of this is a cultural shift to no longer being culturally obligated to marry young and start a family. reply hiAndrewQuinn 3 hours agorootparentHonestly, I think it&#x27;s simply that people have much more interesting lives these days. Babies and entertainment are substitute goods. reply sdsd 3 hours agorootparentI feel this can be easily dramatized in either directionImagine sitting down for 9 hours typing, then going home and scrolling through porn and getting high and thinking that&#x27;s much more interesting than conquering a village, sailing the coast of a new continent, having sex with a beautiful virgin, and teaching your sons to reach even further into greatness.Or on the other hand, the hard reality redpill that your life in the past would be manual labor on a farm as a peasant, making a lord rich.I still lean towards a romantic past - working hard with your village friends, then going to the pub with them, and coming home and making babies with your wife, in a home you own, with a tended garden and many children, sounds better than writing Ansible playbooks and jacking off to pornhub. And this is the life of a loser in the past, compared to a \"winner\" of the present.Maybe it&#x27;s anomie, people don&#x27;t have children when they don&#x27;t believe in their civilization reply Earw0rm 3 hours agorootparentThe losers in the past died of diarrhea aged three.If you made it as far as wife and kids, you were a winner.If wife made it as far as the third kid without dying of sepsis, she was an ultra winner. reply sdsd 3 hours agorootparentBy that standard, most people conceived in the present don&#x27;t even survive the womb reply defrost 2 hours agorootparentWell, ditto the past - not only were diet and other conditions harsher, the Church was happy to prescribe, mix, prepare and administer abortifacients.eg: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daily.jstor.org&#x2F;abortion-remedies-medieval-catholic-...and that&#x27;s Saint Hildegard of Bingen, Abbess and founder of two monasteries handing out the Ye Olde abortion pills.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C9K9PfjRjxM reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re forwarding a false dichotomy here, there&#x27;s a lot more than doomscrolling and writing Ansible playbooks if you don&#x27;t have children, and there&#x27;s a lot more work to having children than tending an idyllic garden. And it&#x27;s not as if you won&#x27;t be up at 9 pm fixing production issues and rewriting Ansible playbooks even with children. In other words, one does not replace the other. reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentprev> and coming home and making babies with your wifeYou mean raising lord’s kid?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Droit_du_seigneur> I still lean towards a romantic past - working hard with your village friends, then going to the pub with them, and coming home and making babies with your wife, in a home you own, with a tended garden and many children, sounds better than writing Ansible playbooks and jacking off to pornhub. And this is the life of a loser in the past, compared to a \"winner\" of the present.Why are so focused on porn? Modern life is amazingly diverse with activities: jumping with parachute, sports, dancing, games, science clubs, I could go in forever. Maybe instead of lamenting try to actually do something except for jerking off and writing ansible for 9 hours? reply Gud 1 hour agorootparent> You mean raising lord’s kid?From the link to wikipedia you sourced:> A majority of historians[citation needed] have concluded that the idea is a myth and that all references to it are from later periods. reply hiAndrewQuinn 1 hour agorootparentprevWell, that&#x27;s why I avoid dramatization. Anyone can daydream - it takes discipline to think on the margin.What do I have? What do I want? How can I beat use the former, to achieve the latter? Those are the questions of practical importance. reply wesapien 3 hours agorootparentprevInteresting? Give me some examples. This problem goes beyond the east vs west. This is about humans failing to learn from the past. Add modernity and progress|regress. reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentSports, science, literature, movies, skydiving, games, online games, learning, I can go on forever about different modern activities. reply ekianjo 3 hours agorootparentprevAnf brainwashing that everyone should have a career while in reality most people end up simply with jobs and not careers. Believing lies has a societal cost. reply Roark66 2 hours agorootparentprev>Finland is a good place to move to fix most of these, if you&#x27;re willing to live with the tradeoffs. And yet, it seems like the slowdown is hitting us as hard as anyone... so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually that.I think you hit the nail on its head so to speak. Here in Poland the parenting&#x2F;childcare situation is probably worse than Finland from what I hear, but much better than it used to be. The change in benefits for example eliminated child poverty, but had zero effect on population growth(which was one of its selling points).I think unless we manage to invent \"artificial womb\" in long term (as humanity) we are going to have huge problems. Not because there will be less of us. No, but because the huge majority will be very old. This will blow up our heathcare, economy etc. Who will care for all these old people? Robots?This is a very serious problem that will hit us in next ~30 years. Imagine if a single person at work supports 5 pensioners? Someone can say, what do you mean, these pensioners are living off investment income on the decades of their contributions. But this is not exactly right. For them to consume someone has to produce. If there is shortage of workforce there will be shortage of goods, the prices will skyrocket, the workers wages will adjust, but pensioners will be left with nothing or will be helped by the state. Also imagine what impact on national security this will have? Religious sects that promote having large families will thrive, imagine what that will do to our societies.I propose in medium term this is a far bigger problem than climate change.What is the solution then? Immigration. (the legal kind). We (the West) have to establish systems that promote migrant integration. For this we absolutely have to give up the insanity of \"cultural relativism\". No, cultures that cherish freedom of the individual and ones that treat women as property are not equivalent. Without the strong backbone of acceptance our culture is superior and certain things are non-negotiable (like individual liberties, freedom of religion, expression, identity) this will not work. But if we can manage to implement this without sliding into extremes people from other places will want to come, live here, work and raise their children. This will solve our (the West) population growth problem in the short to medium term. In the long term? Only robots and artifical wombs. reply CraigJPerry 1 hour agorootparent>> If there is shortage of workforce there will be shortage of goodsAre we sure about this because a shortage of workforce leading to a shortage of services makes sense but the same doesn’t hold for goods I don’t think?E.g. I don’t really see myself going to a robot physiotherapist for example. I can’t see how productivity improvements (capital investment in automation for example) can universally improve service production - there are some cases for sure but plenty of gaps.On the goods side, i don’t care if my TV was made by a robot rather than a craftsperson. As i understand it, the energy and labour required to produce comparable goods today is less than yesterday.As i understand it, services have gotten relatively more expensive over time as goods have done the opposite. These costs I’m led to believe can be seen as a proxy for labour costs since labour is often the most expensive part and as production volume increases the cost to produce a good tends towards the cost of its material inputs. reply DecoySalamander 1 hour agorootparentprev> Religious sects that promote having large families will thrive, imagine what that will do to our societies. > What is the solution then? Immigration.I can understand holding either of those views, but not both at the same time. Why do you expect immigrants from a culture that produces a surplus of people (and pressure to immigrate) to have a lesser&#x2F;better effect on your culture than the offspring of native religious \"sects\"? reply kbos87 5 hours agoparentprevI wrote off the notion of ever having kids in my early 20s in large part because of how expensive it is (and thus what it would mean for my lifestyle.)The funny thing is that thanks to a somewhat successful career in tech, I could afford them more than the average family in my area can. But that doesn’t matter - I’ve conditioned myself to not want them, and I don’t regret not having them one tiny bit. reply Aurornis 4 hours agorootparentYour story is probably very common. The social media narrative (Reddit, Twitter, HN, etc) around children is hilariously detached from reality at times. It’s bizarre as a parent to read 20-something childless people speak so confidently about what it’s like to have children.I participated in a mentoring program where I worked with younger people entering tech careers. It was mind blowing to hear them talk about children as being impossibly expensive while we had just discussed negotiation of their six-figure offer letter a few days prior. It’s like the reality of having kids got distorted and twisted and exaggerated so much on sites like Reddit that they all lost touch with reality and instead cemented the idea that kids were impossible for them.If you’ve “conditioned yourself to not want them” then that’s a really weird place to be. That implies that you did maybe want them at some point and overrode that via “conditioning” based on facts that turned out to be untrue (that you couldn’t afford them). If I was in your shoes, I’d be taking a long, hard look at what other life assumptions you’ve been “conditioned” out of from exposure to false narratives and internet exaggerations.Maybe kids are not for you, but I’ve seen enough very happy parents into even their 40s who started out thinking they never wanted kids until they finally re-evaluated how they arrived at that conclusion and realized it was the result of bad inputs. If you know the key inputs were false, maybe re-run that whole decision process again with a clean slate and some accurate facts. You might be surprised. reply abenga 2 hours agorootparentHaving children is a horrible deal for women though. Given the effect on their careers, health, and social life, I can understand why fewer would willingly choose to have them. This explains why whenever civil protection and economic freedom gives them any semblance of a choice, the number of children they get goes way down. reply hzay 1 hour agorootparentWomen who&#x27;ve had kids live longer & have fewer diseases btw. Breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer. It&#x27;s not such a bad deal actually. reply sambazi 2 hours agorootparentprevno problem, immigration&#x27;s gonna fix it reply pyuser583 4 hours agorootparentprevI see this a lot too. There’s a huge misconception on what having kids is like.Lots of tech folks live in low fertility areas where nobody has kids. So strange ideas just persist. reply camillomiller 3 hours agorootparentprevSo, one is conditioned to “not have kid”, but having them is perfectly natural and there is absolutely no conditioning in wanting them?When my partner in a childless relationship gets asked “but why?” when she says she doesn’t want children, her answer is this: “would you have asked the same question, had I said I want them?” reply bigyikes 3 hours agorootparentNo, they would not have asked that question, because literally 100% of their ancestors for millions of generations had children (or otherwise reproduced). That’s the default option. reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentFor millions of generations there were millions of generations that came to another conclusion and didn’t procreate. And also your assumption that all those millions of generations that you’ve mentioned procreated willingly is false. reply camillomiller 3 hours agorootparentprevWhich reinforces my point. Reddit, an irrelevant blip in history is a stronger conditioning than millennia of “default option”? reply AequitasOmnibus 3 hours agorootparentprevAs a fellow parent I agree with almost everything you wrote. The one thing I disagree with you about is what motivates those people, including OP to remain childless.When it comes down to it, I think the real answer is selfishness. The sacrifice to their way of life, financially and otherwise, is too great for them. We can argue why there is a spike in selfishness - maybe it’s a reaction to an increasingly uncivil world, or maybe it’s due to social media’s hyperfocus on the self.But either way, it’s more socially acceptable to say “raising children is prohibitively expensive these days” than to say “I can’t be bothered to change my solipsistic way of life.” reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentPersonally, I&#x27;ve never understood the selfishness argument, especially by parents, as 1) Isn&#x27;t it more selfish to create a literal new entity of life just for your own whims? and 2) What is wrong with selfishness, especially in light of their own selfishness in 1?This is not even to mention that many parents simply do not care for their children well, as parental child abuse cases as well as the number of potential adoptees in the world is non-trivial. Now that is truly a cruelly selfish act more than any amount of not having kids can be, to bring a conscious entity into the world and then to let it suffer. reply y7 3 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t think that having children is a selfish decision in itself? I have thought long and hard about whether I want kids or not, and ultimately I concluded that I should only have kids if I myself really wanted to raise kids (regardless of say, whether my partner wanted to have kids). Kids do not ask to be born, and life is not a guaranteed net positive. reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentprevWho are they being selfish to?Or maybe parents are selfish? They ever asked their unborn child if they want to be born? reply mackrevinack 3 hours agorootparentpreva lot of people say things like \"ive always wanted kids\". seems kind of selfish as well. just pick any of the cliche things, passing on your genes etc, its all selfish in a way reply parineum 3 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any real mystery on the increase in selfishness, though I think that&#x27;s the negative perspective of it.Individualism has been the cultural focus of education and child rearing for a long time. Having children changes who you are and can stand in the way of achieving your personal or professional goals.I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a bad thing but it&#x27;s easy to see how that could lead to less people wanting to be parents, especially women who&#x27;ve had a much more dramatic cultural shift in the last several decades. reply Dalewyn 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not the person you replied to, but I&#x27;m now in my mid-30s and I too have written off having children for a number of reasons:* Having and raising children is expensive (both financially and otherwise) regardless any factor(s). Any parent will corroborate this.* I do not find life worth foisting upon a new individual; life is nothing but challenges and hardships. I refuse to throw a newborn life into this hellscape.* Related to the above, I refuse to make my children be witnesses to my inevitable death. I am in that phase of life where I must deal with the eventual passing of my parents, and that is fucking hell. I do not wish this experience upon anyone, and to that end I refuse to have children because to do so means I wish this hellish experience upon them.* Children as a concept is hypocritical: On the one hand I am responsible for their well-being and that implies I can and will and should have a say in their life; on the other hand they are independent individuals whom I cannot violate, and I refuse to impose my will upon them anyway because that is not my place.* I find the entire notion of a family far too bothersome for my life. I do not need nor want a spouse whom I won&#x27;t ever understand anyway and whom I will grow to resent. I do not need nor want children whom I won&#x27;t ever understand anyway and whom will grow to resent me. I do not need nor want familial relations which will all be concentrated bullshit. I do not need nor want any of that noise in my life, I desire peace and tranquility. reply gls2ro 4 hours agorootparent> I am in that phase of life where I must deal with the eventual passing of my parents, and that is fucking hellThe life has a way to handle this: children. Not saying you should but just saying that having children makes passing of the parents a bit less hellish. Will not make it easy but children forces us to be in the present and in the local now and contemplate less about about the extended family or past.Just to clarify: it will be extremely immoral and unethical to have children just to alleviate this. And damaging in so many ways. I am just presenting a side effect here. reply tomp 3 hours agorootparentprev> Having and raising children is expensive (both financially and otherwise) regardless any factor(s). Any parent will corroborate this.I’m a parent, I disagree. I might have thought in my 20s that having kids is expensive, but in my 30s I make so much money that is not an issue. Buying a house, that is expensive :)> I do not find life worth foisting upon a new individual; life is nothing but challenges and hardships. I refuse to throw a newborn life into this hellscape.Have you spoken to a therapist recently? You might be depressed. From my point of view, life is beautiful and challenges make it interesting. reply weatherlite 2 hours agorootparent> From my point of view, life is beautiful and challenges make it interestingThis is a very deep and philosophical question, I think its perfectly reasonable for people who are not depressed to still come to the conclusion that they don&#x27;t want to create more life since life itself is too difficult. Even in a best case scenario of being born to a rich, loving family in some prosperous democracy you still have to deal with yours and everyone you loves mortality.I think there&#x27;s another interesting issue that may be going on - people postpone having kids more and more, many start seriously considering it in their late 30s. That&#x27;s an age where most people also start feeling the squeeze of midlife - ill parents you need to take care of, sometimes your own health starting to decline a bit etc. It&#x27;s not surprising some people give up on kids. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are rich enough that raising a child is no longer a major expense for you, is this not the exception that proves the parent commenter&#x27;s rule, then? Most are not so lucky as you. reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentprevImplying that someone is depressed and need to see therapist because their life vision differs from your is extremely ignorant and offensive. Especially when original point isn’t controversial at all. reply croo 2 hours agorootparentprevTo sum up, you don&#x27;t have kids because you want to save them from... life.Uhh are you okay? reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentDon’t worry, some of us are burdened by this weird feeling called “empathy”.

Everybody else just needs support, resources, and instruction.It might be better for a couple that does not have support, resources or knowledge to forgo having children.

This means having a reliable and sufficient income stream to provide for a reasonably comfortable life.

Absolutely no child deserves to knowingly live a destitute life if it can be helped. reply brailsafe 2 hours agorootparentWould-be parents aren&#x27;t authority figures when it comes to either what the goal of parenthood should be, who meets the criteria, or what reasonably comfortable means. Would-be parents get to have their own goals based on their own constraints.My differing opinion is that it&#x27;s irresponsible to opt-in to raising a child if you lack the facilities to care for your basic needs, with a bit of margin. If one minor setback risks putting you on the street, and you have no support structure at all, probably don&#x27;t try and get pregnant. You should be able to provide their basic needs until they can provide their own.

In particular, how it&#x27;s completely taken over society and how we view worth and value.Capitalism doesn&#x27;t care about families. The only thing capitalism cares about is consumption. So it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you have 10 kids or no kids, as long as you&#x27;re consuming, the system is happy. This is of course great if you&#x27;re the kind of person who never wanted kids to begin with.The problem however is that Capitalism is short-sighted. It doesn&#x27;t care about future consumption, just consumption right now in the moment. So inevitably capitalism face issues sustaining itself when there are less people around in the future to consume, as well as sustain all existing debts. reply Osiris 4 hours agorootparentCapitalism wants not just consumption but increasing consumption.

Fundamentally however, that will create all sorts of issues, because it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that money still controls society.Fundamentally, I think the issue is that society no longer has a set of values to propel it forward.

Many wealthy countries will see their population decline - unless they manage to compensate the same with drastically increased levels of immigration. It would take a complete reversal of policy to allow for this to happen in traditionally immigration-sceptic cultures like Japan or South Korea.Immigration from other cultures brings its own set of problems of course and may lead to major social and economic issues in these countries. Newly arriving immigrants frequently lack the education to be easily absorbed into a highly skilled workforce. It may take at least one generation or more to overcome this at great economic cost.But then there are also completely speculative developments that might happen as a society’s population retracts. Property ownership is poised to be more easily attainable for average-income people. As a result, there may be an increase in single-earner families, where the spouse can devote her (or his) time to looking after the children. Which in turn may increase the average number of children that families can afford to have.

It&#x27;s just that they don&#x27;t really need a big family for \"pension\" reasons, don&#x27;t usually care about religious directives anymore (think the big catholic labourer families of old) and want their life to be more than about having kids.

I think a large part of it is that having children is extremely expensive. You need a bigger house, a bigger car, need to buy more food and then pay for their entire life for about 20 years or so. Given the cost to just sustain one’s self these days I think it is not a surprise that many people opt to have fewer children or none at all.I think that also there is a culture shift that has taken place, there is less pressure to create a traditional family unit. More virtue is given to autonomy and following your dreams than settling down. In addition to this, contraceptives such as IUDs have become much more socially accepted, so less people are getting pregnant. Naturally all of this adds up to a drastically lower average fertility rate than a few decades ago.In summary, it’s a bit of culture shift, economics and science which has led us to where we are today. The result is that in the next few decades we will either have to start having more children again, or rework the way our economies are structured to account for less growth in exchange for a focus on sustainability and providing a livable wage for all people. Its likely that if we keep with the status quo, quality of life will keep going down until we hit a breaking point. reply tuatoru 6 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s essentially because of western individualism, de-emphasizing the family unit and prioritizing individual fulfilment.

There&#x27;s no point following books or customs from centuries ago when the world has long moved on. A farmer 200 years ago didn&#x27;t really need to learn to read and write.

Where are the statistics to show that they are individualistic? reply tuatoru 5 hours agorootparentWell, again coming from a \"female choice\" perspective, young Chinese women are striving to have careers (or at least fun) before starting a family. They are being told to do this, and most people conform to expectations. (Choice doesn&#x27;t mean fully independent first-principles decision making.)The rhetoric is still about \"increasing female labor force participation\".[1]For clarity, the thing you do first is your priority. This is known as \"revealed preference\" in economics. And careers are individual things, not collective.Also for background, fertility declines secularly from mid-teens to mid forties where it goes to zero. Waiting has two costs: you have fewer years in which to have children, and you are less likely to have them in each year. (There is a third one in increased risk of congenital illness in the child too.)

Few people I know would do that.A good friend&#x27;s ancestor escaped a prison camp (political prisoner), traveled across a continent, and found their way here.

At the same time some of these countries might have a large welfare state, with benefits like free or cheap healthcare, schooling, state pensions, medical benefits either free or heavily subsidized, unemployment benefits, etcetera.For those countries immigration is a huge cost. Many immigrants moving to such countries will never (be able to) work. But they will use a large amount of resources from the welfare state. And perhaps such countries hope children of these kinds of immigrants will be a net benefit, but only time will tell.Because one additional hurdle is that for many of such countries it’s not expected (and there is little push) for immigrants to integrate into society.For these countries unrestricted mass immigration will mean the dismantling of the welfare state. As there are too many users of welfare services and not enough people paying taxes to finance the welfare state.Many Northern European countries fall onto this group. reply wolverine876 8 hours agorootparentDo you have evidence?

However in almost all west European countries you&#x27;ve got governments doing the exact opposite of the people&#x27;s will.

Belgium itself is of course partially to blame because our social security system is too flexible, too generous and does not push to work.Mass immigration from strongly divergent cultures is damaging western society, causing higher poverty, more crime, and rampant feelings of alienation, tearing at the fabric of social values and cohesion.

They sided very much on the elimination of the welfare state which was the solution they saw for the supposed cost issue (highly questionable to begin with, in a country with as little in the way of social programs as the US after the 1980s drew to a close.

A Radix Trie or Patricia Trie is a space-optimized trie (prefix tree). A Pruning Radix trie is a novel Radix trie algorithm, that allows pruning of the Radix trie and early termination of the lookup. In many cases, we are not interested in a complete set of all children for a given prefix, but only in the top-k most relevant terms. Especially for short prefixes, this results in a massive reduction of lookup time for the top-10 results. On the other hand, a complete result set of millions of suggestions wouldn't be helpful at all for autocompletion. The lookup acceleration is achieved by storing in each node the maximum rank of all its children. By comparing this maximum child rank with the lowest rank of the results retrieved so far, we can heavily prune the trie and do early termination of the lookup for non-promising branches with low child ranks. Performance The Pruning Radix Trie is up to 1000x faster than an ordinary Radix Trie. While 36 ms for an autocomplete might seem fast enough for a single user, it becomes insufficient when we have to serve thousands of users in parallel. Then autocomplete lookups in large dictionaries are only feasible when powered by something much faster than an ordinary radix trie. While a prefix of length=1 is not very useful for the Latin alphabet, it does make sense for CJK languages. Also, there are many more application fields for a fast prefix search algorithm beyond character-wise word completion: Instead of characters, the prefix can be composed of arbitrary items, e.g. whole words in a query completion, or towns in a long routing sequence. Dictionary Terms.txt contains 6 million unigrams and bigrams derived from English Wikipedia, with term frequency counts used for ranking. But you can use any frequency dictionary for any language and domain of your choice.

Nobody in practice would do that, storing the maximum score for each subtree so you can prune is a very common technique, definitely not novel here.Even doing a Levenshtein-bounded beam search along the trie is pretty much common practice, see for example this paper [1] from 2011.There are more sophisticated ways of doing this in space-efficient ways, for example this paper [2] I co-authored in 2013.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;... reply agencies 19 hours agoparentWhat is state of the art currently? reply rutgersnj22 16 hours agorootparenthere is a more recent paper where I am one of the authors: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vldb.org&#x2F;pvldb&#x2F;vol9&#x2F;p828-deng.pdf reply itake 15 hours agorootparenthttps link:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vldb.org&#x2F;pvldb&#x2F;vol9&#x2F;p828-deng.pdf reply sa-code 19 hours agorootparentprevLucene&#x27;s WFST is absurdly fast reply anonzzzies 19 hours agorootparentprevAnd also; are there implementations to look at? Or libraries&#x2F;open source dbs&#x2F;search engines that use these? reply alexchamberlain 14 hours agoparentprevIs the `PruningRadixTrie` the same as the Completion Trie? reply eatonphil 20 hours agoprevPart of the optimization here seems to be that you only return the top 10 results. This might result in a really annoying UX though if you can&#x27;t page through other results.For example to tag someone on LinkedIn in a post you have to type their name (this comes up when I share someone&#x27;s blog post on LinkedIn who I&#x27;m not connected with). But if their name doesn&#x27;t come up within the top 10 results there seems to be literally no way to tag them.And this isn&#x27;t a permissions issue about tagging people I&#x27;m not connected with either. If the person I&#x27;m trying to tag who I&#x27;m not connected with has an uncommon name, I can normally find them in the auto complete list and tag them. If they have a common name, I often can&#x27;t.I&#x27;m not posting this to ask for solutions, just to say that being arbitrarily limited to top results can sometimes be infuriating. reply gwern 20 hours agoparentOP includes the entire trie if you set the minimum rank to -INF, so that&#x27;s not an issue with the data structure but the UX, I would think? The data structure can show all the results, it&#x27;s just a matter of knowing when the user wants to see more.You&#x27;d need something like a button for &#x27;show more results&#x27;, or perhaps use a timeout (&#x27;if no user action in 10s, assume the desired result is missing & show more results) where it increases the _n_ limit (say, doubling each time). Then the user only pays for what they use, and the common case remains accelerated. reply swader999 20 hours agorootparentYou could use scroll event(s) to trigger more results. reply ok123456 20 hours agoparentprevHe keeps the sorted frequency count.

E.g. are two chars still not enough for Chinese languages? reply meepmorp 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen 1.5 chars&#x2F;token used as a rule of thumb for estimating token counts in Chinese text. reply kazinator 6 hours agoprevHere is what I hate in modern completion UIs.You type one character, and the thing scampers off like a rabid squirrel, hogging the CPU, so that the UI becomes unresponsive to me typing the remaining characters.If you just prioritize the interactive response, the algorithm is almost moot.When the user types m, you could as well show a completely random selection of 20 things that start with m. Or nothing. Take your time; the user will type more stuff.When there are enough characters of context so that the selection is pruned down, there you need to be responsive. The user starts to see meaningful things in the list. When they type another character to refine it, they want it updated instantly.Completion that is too eager is exactly like a person who doesn&#x27;t wait for you to finish talking, jumps to conclusions about what you&#x27;re going to say and starts replying.Here is another thing I hate: when I see a completion I like that is itself not complete, let me continue! Sometimes the completion gives me the word I was going to type, but there is more; i.e. I wanted just to complete a part of my typing, not to choose that item as the result of the query.I find myself manually typing the word I see in the completion list, because I know that if I click on it, it will search for that, which is not what I want.The completion should always go into the query box, where the user can refine it before submitting it. Or at least make it an option.It doesn&#x27;t actually cost an extra click. All it means that if I use down arrow to go into the completions, the currently selected completion is copied to the query box. Then I can type more characters, or hit Enter to dispatch the query. If all I want is to dispatch the completion, it&#x27;s the same number of keystrokes: down arrow to pick a completion, then Enter.Do not have it so that when I hit down arrow, the text I typed stays the same, so that the only choice I have is to hit Enter to dispatch \"microsoft\" or else continue my original text from \"micr\". Maybe I want the word \"microsoft\" and then continue typing \" teams\" or whatever. reply somat 16 hours agoprevIn the game \"keep talking and nobody explodes\" one of the puzzles has you match a limited set of characters in each position to a dictionary of possible words. A task I was having a lot of trouble doing in the limited time provided. I ended up rewriting the dictionary as a prefix tree and including it as a addendum to the manual.It was neat seeing seeing these algorithms work at human scale and how much better it made the process. reply cirwin 20 hours agoprevI wrote something like this for contact auto completion - running in the browser we had to ensure that both tree construction was fast, and also that completion was instantaneous.

Sign up here Home Opinion 54% of Portugal’s electricity is now generated by renewable energy 54% of Portugal’s electricity is now generated by renewable energy Since my last article regarding the successful harnessing of tidal power to generate electricity, I have been researching what progress Portugal has made towards renewable energy production, and it’s impressive. Some authorities claim that this has now risen to 60% By Paul Luckman, in Opinion, Sustainability · 1 day ago · 1 Comments No nuclear, no coal Portugal has made significant strides in integrating renewable energy sources into its electricity generation. The country has taken advantage of solar power, tidal power wind generation, and hydroelectric power plants. Portugal is becoming a World leader in developing every form of energy independence. At the end of 2021, Portugal became coal-free after shutting down its 628MW Pego coal-fired power plant, privately owned by utility Tejo Energia. Pego's closure came just ten months after the shutdown of the 1,250MW Sines coal plant, owned by national utility EDP. No nuclear, no coal-produced power. Sometimes the progress passes our attention, but we should be aware of the significant progress Portugal is making. Sustainable energy practices have become a key focus for many countries worldwide. With the increasing awareness of climate change, countries are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint and transition towards renewable energy sources. Portugal has been a leader in sustainable energy practices, setting ambitious targets and implementing policies to achieve them. I have looked at Portugal's approach to sustainable energy practices, compare it to other EU countries, and look at the challenges faced by these countries in transitioning to sustainable energy. Significant progress Portugal has made significant progress towards achieving its renewable energy targets, with renewable energy sources accounting for 54% of its energy consumption in 2019. This is higher than the EU average of 18%. Latest figures claim that the figure is now at 60%. Portugal has also invested more in renewable energy sources than many other EU countries, particularly in wind and solar power. However, Portugal faces challenges in transitioning to sustainable energy practices, including the high cost of renewable energy projects and the need for infrastructure upgrades. Other EU countries face similar challenges, with some countries lagging behind in achieving their renewable energy targets. More than a trend Portugal seems to understand that sustainability is more than a trend, it is a vision towards the future. In the last decade, investing in this strategic development path has been seen more like a moral obligation for both entities and companies, as well as a way of achieving a positive advancement for their economy. Portugal has carried out remarkable progress in this field until becoming a country leader in the renewable energy transition. Quite an achievement for a small country. In January 2022, 4,085 GWh of electricity were generated in mainland Portugal, where 63.64% came from renewable sources being 31.27% wind, 17.78% hydro, 6.99% bioenergy, 3.80% solar and 3.80 pumping. However, Portugal still remains reliant on imported gas, as the remaining 36.36% came mainly from natural gas, which accounted a 31.27%. All of Portugal's natural gas is imported, mainly from Algeria (via a pipeline that transits through Spain) and from Nigeria (LNG). We are not reliant on President Putin! Portugal has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, aiming to achieve 80% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2030. To achieve this, Portugal has implemented several policies, including feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and subsidies for renewable energy projects. Portugal has invested heavily in wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, and now tidal power. In addition, Portugal has implemented energy efficiency measures, such as building codes that require energy-efficient buildings and the use of smart grid technology to manage energy consumption. Energy-efficient buildings are a major factor for people, many of whom seem to believe that all construction is seriously inadequate in this area. This is simply not true. Older buildings were, and still are, very basic and subject to damp, cold and excess heat in the summer. But go back 100 years or more and look at traditional buildings. These are frequently built with very thick walls, and a minimum of windows, and are quite effective at keeping both warm and cool at the appropriate times of the year. If you are looking at an old farmhouse or country building, then you will need to look very seriously at bringing insulation up to date. Older local buildings do suffer from dampness, not least as they have no efficient ventilation. I live in a property about 15 years old, it has cavity walls filled with foam. We don’t have damp, it has double glazing as standard, although we needed to upgrade this, and is warm in the winter and cold in the summer, aided with efficient air conditioning with heat pumps, which are widely available. The UK is still trying to legislate to get homeowners to install heat pumps, but here in Portugal, these are standard. Over the last ten years, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal – have seen the highest rate of heat pump installations, with the number of annual installations per household more than doubling over a decade. Still reliant on imported electricity Portugal still needs to import electricity, mainly from Spain. However, Portugal also exports electricity. In 2021, Portugal imported $1.47B in electricity, becoming the 18th largest importer of electricity in the world. In the same year, Electricity was the 7th most imported product in Portugal. Portugal imports electricity primarily from Spain ($1.47B). In 2021, Portugal exported $561M in electricity, making it the 32nd largest exporter of electricity in the world. In the same year, electricity was the 26th most exported product in Portugal. The main destination of electricity exports from Portugal are Spain ($561M). At least we sell back almost 50% of what we import. It is frequently claimed that EDP is owned by the Chinese. This is far from true. On February 4th, 2022, China Three Gorges (Europe), S.A. notified EDP that, in accordance with article 16 of the Portuguese Securities Code, it had reached a qualifying shareholding correspondent to 20.22% of EDP’s share capital and of the respective voting rights. The 20% threshold was crossed by China Three Gorges (Europe), S.A. on February 1st, 2022. Why is electricity so expensive, blame the tax man Unfortunately, Portugal has some of the highest prices for electricity in Europe thanks to taxes. According to Eurostat, we pay €0.2246 per kWh here which is 22% higher than in the UK. The “taxes and charges” component in Portugal is one of the highest in Europe and practically doubles the final price of electricity compared to the base value in Portugal according to EDP. The other question frequently asked is why isn’t power from renewables cheaper? The simple answer to that is that the businesses that install and maintain them are not charities. They survive by making a profit, which seems reasonable. Also consider the capital investment needed to construct and install the units, be they solar, wind or even tide power. The old expression goes that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The sun wind and tides are free, but the equipment needed to harness what they produce isn’t. You may feel that the government should subsidise the equipment, but that would come from our taxes. Whichever way you look at it, renewables are saving our planet, not our pockets.

    "commentBody": "54% of Portugal’s electricity is now generated by renewable energyHacker Newspastlogin54% of Portugal’s electricity is now generated by renewable energy (theportugalnews.com) 168 points by belter 15 hours ago| hidepastfavorite184 comments vmsp 13 hours agoI&#x27;d like to offer a more critical perspective as a Portuguese living in Portugal.We&#x27;re a country with very severe economical, financial, social and health problems which have been unsolved for years. Living in Portugal is a hard and it&#x27;s expected it will get harder and harder. We have tons of young people leaving the country every year.Our CO2 emissions are like 0.15% of the total and our per-capita emissions are already lower than for ex. Germany. We basically have no industry. If we could wave a magic wand and completely stop our CO2 emissions it wouldn&#x27;t move the needle on global warming at all.Notwithstanding these facts, the government went all in on renewables and cutting down on emissions -- despite it not making any sense -- because it&#x27;s a popular measure across all age groups.Energy companies had to invest in still unproven renewable tech which was very costly. As a result, energy companies then had to amortize this investment and now we have one the highest energy prices in all of Europe. Had we chosen to start investing in renewables more recently, like Brazil, we would be buying better and cheaper tech.So, we -- the Portuguese -- are worse, overall, because of these short sighted measures. But, hey, at least we get good press. reply dubcanada 13 hours agoparentA few things> If we could wave a magic wand and completely stop our CO2 emissions it wouldn&#x27;t move the needle on global warming at all.Some people completely ignore the fact that it does help, it may not help the ozone above China, but having a country that is not pumping out ash and other byproducts into the air does make it citizens healthier. They live longer, they have less health issues, they pay more taxes (potentially longer job life span), and they are happier. So regardless of the short sighted \"we are too small to do anything\" statement. It does help.> Notwithstanding these facts, the government went all in on renewables and cutting down on emissions -- despite it not making any sense -- because it&#x27;s a popular measure across all age groups.Another interesting statement, should it not make sense for a government to do what it&#x27;s citizens want?> Energy companies had to invest in still unproven renewable tech which was very costly.Solar is fairly new, but wind is certainly not new in any fashion, along with water it is one of the oldest forms of energy generation that exist. If anything coal&#x2F;nuclear are newer than wind. And tidal assuming a stable tidal pattern is also an easy engineering issue to solve. I am not sure beyond solar you can argue \"unproven renewable tech\".> Had we chosen to start investing in renewables more recently, like Brazil, we would be buying better and cheaper tech.You can&#x27;t really say that, if that&#x27;s an argument then nobody would ever buy anything, because it could always be better and cheaper later.I get the reasoning for your statement, because investing in natural gas or other oil methods like that can provide more faster for the general populace. But there is no reason that renewable cannot ALSO do that, it&#x27;s just nobody has an example of such case. And there are plenty of examples with gas. reply sofixa 12 hours agorootparent> Another interesting statement, should it not make sense for a government to do what it&#x27;s citizens want?Nope, not always, and this is why direct democracy is pretty inefficient. People aren&#x27;t experts, are often shortsighted and thinking at the micro level: many government policies and choices need long term thinking and expertise at the macro level. Take a look at Switzerland - \"green\" measures such as a carbon tax, which is considered by many experts as one of the best policies to reduce CO2 emissions, was refused by voters, because they&#x27;re thinking about the impact it will have on them personally, now, and not about all the negative things which will be reduced with such a tax. reply fwungy 12 hours agorootparentIt would cost them a lot of money and have no impact on CO2 levels. Chinese and Indians will not magnanimously sacrifice their money to lower their CO2, and if they don&#x27;t then it doesn&#x27;t matter. reply toomuchtodo 12 hours agorootparentThe rest of the world can encourage China and India with economic sanctions if they won’t come along for the renewables and EV ride. With that said, China at least is an example of moving to EVs and renewables rapidly. reply belorn 11 hours agorootparentprevCould we explore a bit in how it would cost them money. Taxes in general get back into the economy unless the government stockpile the revenue or invest them over sea. It would increase costs for companies doing exports, raising costs on mining (29.9% of total exports), and maybe organic chemicals exports. Switzerland second largest export is Pharmaceuticals, but I am unsure how much a carbon tax would impact that industry.If they also applied it to imports then countries with high CO2 would have a harder time to export to Switzerland. Having less access to cheap products with high carbon footprint would add a costs to citizens, as alternative products will likely cost more, but then it would also encourage industries in China&#x2F;India to produce products with lower footprint in order to compete on markets with carbon taxes&#x2F;tariffs based on carbon footprint. It might even encourage local productions which can be a boon for the economy. reply dubcanada 12 hours agorootparentprevWith that attitude, nobody is going to do anything. reply pydry 11 hours agorootparentprev>Nope, not always, and this is why direct democracy is pretty inefficient.

I&#x27;m sure they want low energy prices now. reply conjecTech 13 hours agoparentprevSomething like 80% of Portugal&#x27;s solar has been installed since 2018[1], when solar was on-par with if not cheaper than any other form of electricity generation. And that&#x27;s from aggregate perspective, the economics are definitely better for Portugal. There were PPA being signed in similar geographies for 3c&#x2F;kwh that year. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the defrayed cost from lower fossil fuel usage just since the start of war in Ukraine has fully offset the cost of the installation. I&#x27;m not sure why you think this has been so costly for average citizens.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pv-tech.org&#x2F;portugal-installs-more-solar-pv-in-2... reply CrLf 2 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;d like to offer a more critical perspective as a Portuguese living in Portugal.I’d like to offer some context for comments such as these as a portuguese living in Portugal.The portuguese have very low self-esteem as a people. They very often criticize their own country in very harsh terms with a strong bias towards “the grass is always greener on the other side” and tend to steer conversations away from any positive aspects (most often by trying to present them as negative).Foreigners are expected to passively agree with negative comments about Portugal. But beware: contributing with additional negative aspects is frowned upon and will trigger a sudden patriotic episode. reply regularjack 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s so typically Portuguese to look at good news and somehow see it as bad news. I&#x27;m Portuguese, and I too suffer from this syndrome at times.Not this time. Glad to see Portugal is on the right track. reply vmsp 13 hours agorootparentYou missed the point.Us not polluting is, obviously, great news.What we had to do to get to get here is the bad news. We chose to invest cash we don&#x27;t have in fixing a problem we don&#x27;t (really) cause and to which we don&#x27;t (really) have a solution for. This, while 1&#x2F;4 of the population earns minimum wage. My conclusion still stands. reply dottjt 13 hours agorootparentNot to invalidate what you&#x27;re saying, but surely every country has it&#x27;s problems? While the problems you sight are significant, if this has been the case for a while, would they have been resolved if all the money had not been invested into renewables?It sounds like culturally, those problems would still exist today i.e. due to corruption, but at least you have the renewables in place, as opposed to not have them.I feel like you&#x27;re looking for an ideal version that doesn&#x27;t exist in reality. reply Gys 13 hours agorootparentprevI am not Portuguese but live here for some years now. It surprises me often how happy Portuguese can be with minor details that work while there are so many much more serious problems.For example: some years ago several people mentioned the roads of Portugal were the best of Europe. I had a hard time believing because many local roads were worse than I remember from most countries. After the 3rd person or so I started wondering and looked it up. Turned out this was only for highways, which Portugal has only a few and build with EU money. Plus Portugal was actually only second, the Dutch highways were the best. Something I suspect at that time was not really frontpage news in the Netherlands. Until today many local roads are very bad. reply renewedrebecca 7 hours agorootparentI live in Ohio, but spent a couple of weeks in Portugal last year, including in some remote areas... Your roads on the whole are better than ours, by a long shot. reply hutzlibu 13 hours agoparentprev\"Had we chosen to start investing in renewables more recently, like Brazil, we would be buying better and cheaper tech.\"Yeah, everyone could just wait, until the magic revolutionary renewable tech comes around the corner and everyone implements it at once. Except progress usually does not work like that.People do not learn to install solar panels or wind turbines over night. You want a solid growing workforce that can do that. And if not enough people are buying it, no one will produce those panels, can install or maintain them, or develope better ones.And if this doesn&#x27;t happen, then we will soon really learn, what a migration crisis looks like. reply wenc 6 hours agorootparentDepending on your priorities and your constraints, there&#x27;s a sort of \"optimal\" time to enter the market. If you look at the technology adoption curve, early adopters are those with excess cash. If you don&#x27;t have excess cash, your money is better spent entering the cycle later, when the technology evolution is close to plateauing (when all the major issues have been sorted out, and now the improvements are only marginal).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Technology_adoption_life_cycleFor infrastructure, some countries (rich ones) can be early adopters, because early adoption means more cash outlay for technology that is still rapidly evolving and will likely be outdated soon, which requires replacement. But poorer countries might find it more prudent to be Early Majority or Late Majority adopters. Consider subway systems -- early adopters like NYC made it possible for technology to improve. But if you look at subways in Asia, many systems are far more technologically advanced than NY&#x27;s MTA because they came online later, when train technology had matured and they could afford more with less $.We need early adopters, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone needs to be an early adopter. reply hutzlibu 3 hours agorootparent\"We need early adopters, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone needs to be an early adopter.\"That&#x27;s right, but the time for early adopters with renewables was 20+ years ago. reply wenc 3 hours agorootparentAnd so it was. But even back then, not every country ought to have been one. The US should have been. It has the cash and the ability to continuously invest and upgrade. Papua New Guinea, maybe not. They have other things to invest in that are more pressing than bootstrapping nascent technology. That’s my point. reply fwungy 12 hours agoparentprevYou made the politicians who signed off on this very wealthy. Government programs mean big contracts, and the people who decide on those contracts always get their slice.If they were serious about decarbonization they&#x27;d be pushing next gen nuclear to the point that electricity was so cheap that fossil tech couldn&#x27;t compete.What we&#x27;re doing now is subsidizing cheap oil for China, while soaking American and European consumers, but the politicians are getting their slice, so why not? reply thinkcontext 9 hours agorootparent> If they were serious about decarbonization they&#x27;d be pushing next gen nuclearWell, then you must be overjoyed to learn that in the US just that is being done. Between the Infrastructure Act and the IRA there&#x27;s money for:- new technology development- a nuclear production tax credit- domestic fuel so we don&#x27;t have to buy uranium from RussiaI&#x27;m sure after learning this you will feel moved to write Joe Biden a thank you card for implementing the exact policy you are advocating. reply pydry 10 hours agorootparentprevNuclear power stations are built solely for the purposes of supporting a nuclear military (like in Russia, the USA or France) or building nuclear weapons in a hurry (like in Sweden, Iran or South Korea).No country does it for any other reason. Certainly not for the environment. The cost is absolutely prohibitive (5x solar&#x2F;wind) and it demands lavish subsidies even if you discount the nearly free government-granted catastrophe insurance.The only way to make it cheap for the consumer is to have paid off the plants because they were built 50 years ago and to neglect their maintenance. Like France.Pumped storage, solar and wind meanwhile, are very, very reasonably priced. reply sergiosgc 12 hours agoparentprevWrong take, and a prime example of the national sport of being overly negative and pessimistic.Portugal did go early into the wind power game. It had its costs but also produced know-how and a relevant industry stake in that market.The solar installation effort was much better timed. Solar being fed into the grid is a lot cheaper than other sources, except for hydro (built in the 60s&#x2F;70s, mostly already paid for).The current push will create 40GW of capacity, for a country that uses 9GW peak. It should be enough to run the country 100% on renewables. That&#x27;s a game changer.Remove oil&#x2F;gas imports from the national trade balance, and Portugal is suddenly a very very rich country. reply landemva 11 hours agorootparent> Remove oil&#x2F;gas imports from the national trade balance, and Portugal is suddenly a very very rich country.Is energy that much of typical person&#x27;s spend? And internal creation of energy doesn&#x27;t drop the cost to consumers to zero. reply sergiosgc 2 hours agorootparentIt is a relevant portion of a personal budget, if you include transportation costs. On a national level, though, it&#x27;s huge. Portugal imports all of its oil and gas, and has a trade balance that is permanently on the slightly negative side. Energy is a very easy way to fix that, with excellent economic second order effects. reply ifdefdebug 12 hours agoparentprev> and now we have one the highest energy prices in all of EuropeI hear that over and over again but... looking at my last EDP bill I find that I pay €0.15&#x2F;kWh so what am I missing? reply cesarb 13 hours agoparentprev> Had we chosen to start investing in renewables more recently, like Brazil, we would be buying better and cheaper tech.Brazil has been investing in renewables for nearly a century. For instance, the Henry Borden hydroelectric power plant is from 1926. reply ncruces 12 hours agorootparentWe built 12 hydro power plants in the 1950s. That&#x27;s not really what the OP is talking about, but a trend in the early 2000s of overbuilding wind at prices that didn&#x27;t make sense for the next 20 years, and hardly make sense now, 20 years later. Building solar now (which is as much responsible for current results as anything else) also makes financial sense. reply hh3k0 13 hours agoparentprev> If we could wave a magic wand and completely stop our CO2 emissions it wouldn&#x27;t move the needle on global warming at all.That stance could be held by virtually every country, condemning us to collective inaction. reply TacticalCoder 13 hours agorootparentGP&#x27;s point is that Portugal wasn&#x27;t the best placed country to go all-in on renewable energy because it was already economically in trouble and that the last thing Portuguese people needed was higher energy prices.There are other countries that have stronger economies which are better placed to \"go green\". reply vmsp 13 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s just wrong. If China (29%) and the US (14%) waved the said wand we&#x27;d cut down emissions by almost 50% and would be looking at a completely different scenario. reply rlpb 13 hours agoparentprevBy being early, I hope that you have acquired expertise that you can now export. reply grecy 13 hours agoparentprevIt is good that something has been improved, and now you have concrete proof that change in the right direction is possible.Now that renewables are on the rise, the same effort can be put into other things that need improvement. It&#x27;s a great start! reply DoingIsLearning 14 hours agoprevImportant to note that Portugal&#x27;s geography allows it to have a large fraction of base load met with an unvarying renewable - Hydro.Not all nations will be able to reach these numbers with traditionally intermitent renewables like Solar&#x2F;Wind. reply Gys 14 hours agoparentThe hydro comes from artificial lakes filled by rain and rivers coming from Spain. Rain is becoming less and less. Spain is keeping more and more of the river waters, despite some agreements on this. reply onethought 13 hours agoparentprevAll countries individually - sure. But the Sun is not intermittent. The planet just spins. You put enough solar panels on enough geographical locations (and connect them together) you get permanent solar without storage. reply pdpi 13 hours agorootparent> You put enough solar panels on enough geographical locations (and connect them together) you get permanent solar without storage.In theory? Yes. In practice? You have one whole hemisphere powering the other hemisphere, which makes transmission a brutal challenge. reply onethought 3 hours agorootparentAgree. That’s the tricky bit. But it’s also just straight up solvable engineering challenge. Which we’ve proved as a species we are pretty good at those. reply acover 13 hours agorootparentprevTransmission loss will kill you. It&#x27;s like 1% per 100 miles depending on the voltage. reply dools 13 hours agorootparentThat’s for AC thought right? Ultra high voltage direct current is pretty efficient for transmission I thought reply zdragnar 13 hours agorootparentPer 1000km (670 miles) AC&#x27;s efficiency tops out at 6.7% losses, and DC 3.5%.The earth&#x27;s circumference is 40,000 km, or 24,000 miles. Even if hurricanes and monsoon seasons weren&#x27;t a problem, you&#x27;re still looking at obscene transmission losses to get energy to NYC in the middle of the night- say 55% or worse... and that&#x27;s not even counting the fact that the lines can&#x27;t hug the earth&#x27;s surface, they need to run along the bottom of the ocean floors to avoid damage by storms, boats and currents. reply kgabis 2 hours agorootparentDo we even have enough copper to pull that off? reply cycomanic 12 hours agorootparentprevHVDC transmission losses are 3.5% per 1000km compared to 6.7% per 1000km for HVAC [1 ] so you are order of magnitude off.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-voltage_direct_current reply littlestymaar 12 hours agorootparent6.7% per 1000km is .65% per 100km which is almost exactly 1% per 100miles, as GP said.So it&#x27;s just off by a factor two if you compare with DC. reply abraae 13 hours agorootparentprevMost locations can experience many hours or days of cloud cover, which can slash solar panel output by e.g 90%.That&#x27;s what intermittent means in the context of solar. reply onethought 13 hours agorootparentNo it doesn’t. Just provision 10x more solar then. Intermittency solved.(And yes, it’s still cheaper than say, nuclear even if you provision 10x) reply sofixa 12 hours agorootparentWhat about a multi-month event with overcast weather with low winds over a whole continent (it was the case across most of Europe in 2020)? Just over provision by 100x? Is it still cheaper if you include all the land used? reply onethought 4 hours agorootparentPretty sure it stays quite sunny in the desert. Also, there are quite a lot of deserts around the world.The land given it serves no other purpose is probably not expensive. reply littlestymaar 12 hours agorootparentprev> Just provision 10x more solar then.

Take UK or northern Europe and you&#x27;d need 50x.> And yes, it’s still cheaper than say, nuclear even if you provision 10xWhat are you smoking? Also it would generate about 100 times more wastes (not talking about high activity waste of course, in which case it would be like a million time more waste) reply onethought 4 hours agorootparentWhat waste does a solar panel generate? Or are you talking about the manufacturing process? So you’re saying building nuclear plants generates less waste than building solar farms? That’s unintuitive reply kgabis 2 hours agorootparentOf course nuclear generates less waste than intermittent sources like solar or wind. Nuclear occupies orders of magnitude less land, requires less concrete, steel, copper, aluminium. And it&#x27;s still comparing apples to oranges since nuclear is not intermittent and doesn&#x27;t require building extra storage and grid infrastructure to account for variability. reply littlestymaar 55 minutes agorootparentprev> What waste does a solar panel generate? Or are you talking about the manufacturing process?I&#x27;m talking about the panels themselves after they reached their end of life.> So you’re saying building nuclear plants generates less waste than building solar farms? That’s unintuitiveNuclear power density is incredibly high: you build 1 concrete bunker and 3 supporting buildings and you have more than a gigawatt of power. For solar you need a square kilometer of solar panels to get 0.1GW.Compare those two places next to where I live:- the nuclear plan: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;#map=14&#x2F;47.7311&#x2F;2.5188- the solar farm: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;#map=14&#x2F;47.7229&#x2F;2.6665Roughly the same area. The solar farm has 55MW of power. The nuclear plant has 3.6GW, 65 times higher. And the nuclear plant&#x27;s life will be 60 years at least, which means that over its lifetime the panels would need to be changed 3 times. And that&#x27;s if there&#x27;s no hail to damage them…And this calculation only counts Power, if you did the same calculation for actual energy produced the difference would be around ten time worse. replylittlestymaar 12 hours agorootparentprev> But the Sun is not intermittent. The planet just spins.FYI clouds exist as well.> You put enough solar panels on enough geographical locations (and connect them together)It would cost orders of magnitude more in infra for the connection part that the power generation would (well, except for the solar panels you&#x27;d need to put on the Pacific Ocean, which is almost an hemisphere in itself, of course) reply onethought 4 hours agorootparentIf 18% is nearly a hemisphere.Agree the connection part would be tricky.

A discussion about renewable energy wouldn&#x27;t be the same without it! reply epistasis 14 hours agorootparentMy hope is that some day that the passion for the political side of nuclear translates into passion for the logistical and project management challenges of nuclear. There&#x27;s this false belief that if people just wanted nuclear, politically, it would be built in large amounts.In reality, in advanced economies with high labor costs, nuclear is nearly impossible to build. This is true even in countries like France, that complete large construction projects like public transit and trains without cost disease.In the US, we are beset with an additional challenge beyond the inherent high costs of high-labor demands for precision construction; we also have difficulty with any sort of project management of large construction projects.If nuclear has a future in the US, we need to start construction on 100GW of reactors in the next few years to replace reactors at their end of life. But we only have a few tiny projects for SMRs, with designs that are barely complete, if at all.The US is going to lose most of its nuclear power before it will build it back, if it ever does build back more nuclear. This is a stark contrast to renewables and storage, which are mature technologies that are on the TW scale, a magnitude that the nuclear industry can only dream of. reply bee_rider 13 hours agorootparentI really don’t think there’s much passion for nuclear power generally, I never see it discussed in any context other than as a contrast to renewables.I’ll believe it has a future when I see people randomly bringing it up in oil price discussions or things like that. reply epistasis 9 hours agorootparentI do see that occasionally, but it is not a large percentage of people.One of the most influential people in energy, Jigar Shah, is far more rosy on the possibility of the nuclear industry getting its act together than I am.

Personally, I view the fossil fuel plants differently than nuclear, I would much prefer that the majority of steady state power generation was nuclear, but that does present quite a target and threat to the rest of the world during a time of war. I don’t have all the answers here, just wanted to start with my thinking.Getting away from fossil fuels is not a pie in the sky proposal these days. You could look at the success of the lithium storage battery in Australia, previously serviced by fossil fuel peaker plants. There is pumped hydro, and all manner of other non-chemical storage that is possible.There are certainly a range of options that are 100% renewable with storage, but at this moment don’t compete on price with natural gas or even coal if you only factor the cost of the input to the system. Can we agree on that?I would say the inexpensive nature of fossil fuels ignores the total cost of the fuel. We’re basically setting up future generations for a complicated terraforming process to recover the atmosphere to something that supports our farming needs and temperature needs to support life, not just our own but the natural world we rely on.This cost might not factor in to the per&#x2F;MW cost of coal or NG, but it should. This is factored into nuclear (waste storage) so to ignore its cost for fossil fuels is disingenuous. reply onethought 13 hours agorootparentprevYes you can. The good faith question to ask is: is the cost of nuclear higher than renewable +storage?I don’t know the answer, but renewable +storage is trending down. Nuclear is up. So at some point (which may have already happened) nuclear is just going to be a bad faith argument. replykmax12 14 hours agoprevIf you&#x27;re curious about this data for the United States, I built a site that lets you track renewable production, as well as many other interesting datasets about the US electrical grid.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gridstatus.io&#x2F;map reply jorge-d 14 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s a nice looking map, I&#x27;m personally a big fan of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.electricitymaps.com&#x2F;I&#x27;m sure you could use the same datapoint to cover more zones (cf their Github repo https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;electricitymaps&#x2F;electricitymaps-contrib&#x2F;b...) reply kmax12 14 hours agorootparentI am too!We focus on the United States, so we can have the deepest coverage for each of the regions.

For the regions with the pie charts, those are Independent System Operators (ISOs) or Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). They publish much more data and is more real time than the other regions, so we have different pages to display them. reply KennyBlanken 13 hours agorootparentprevNuclear is strictly a base load power source. It takes on the scale of \"many hours\" to days to change generation level at a nuke, and there&#x27;s intense economic pressure to operate them at full capacity as much as possible because its opex is largely fixed and enormous (as is the capex from construction.)This is why all the people shrieking about how evil the public was&#x2F;is for &#x27;irrationally&#x27; hating nuclear and how we need more nuclear (here, on twitter, and reddit) are idiots, especially when they talk about it providing \"grid stability\" because of those naughty, highly variable renewables.Grid stability comes from fast-reacting power sources like natural gas, hydro, and energy storage systems like pumped hydro and batteries. The most famous example of this is in the UK, where pumped hydro is fast enough to react to \"The Great British Kettle Surge\" aka TV pickup:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TV_pickupVideo covering Electric Mountain (9GWHr capacity) by Tom Scott: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6Jx_bJgIFhIAny time someone opens their mouth and says nuclear is the solution to \"days with no sun or wind\", you can immediately discount everything else that comes out of their mouth as being from a person who doesn&#x27;t understand the first thing about electrical grids&#x2F;generation.Even if it were feasible to change power levels fast enough to react to wind and solar generation changing from a physics standpoint, no power authority in the world would keep nuclear generation (the most expensive form of power generation already) capacity in reserve for a cloudy day.What we need are more renewable sources, more energy storage, and a wide-scale HVDC distribution network to be able to cost-effectively move power from areas where there is strong generation by renewables to areas that need it, or at least into storage. reply syntaxing 14 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m surprised how much is nuclear in the states I have lived in.

My intuition tells me it can never quite be 100%. How wrong am I? reply belorn 13 hours agoparentRenewable electricity production can be anything. Just because you produce something does not mean the same country has to consume it, nor that it is connected to the general grid. Renewable production can be 100% if that is what a given country is set to produce and sell on the international market.Renewable electricity consumption is a bit more tricky. People generally consume energy independently from when energy is optimally produced, so intermittent nature of renewable is a problem. There are countries which are very close to 100% renewable production but which import more than 50% of the energy that they actually consume, while at the same time being energy export positive because of massive exports during periods of optimal weather conditions. reply bryanlarsen 13 hours agoparentprevIn the last 30 years there has never been a time where there wasn&#x27;t wind or sun somewhere in Europe.So in theory it&#x27;s possible to hit 100% even without storage. But obviously not in practice since it might mean you need enough generation and distribution to supply the entire continent from a tiny corner of it. (And the next night it might be a different corner).Once you add storage 100% becomes more practical, but \"practical\" is more a question of \"how much are you willing to spend\".

There are lots of new nuclear reactor designs. The current designs (pressurized water reactors) all need very thick pressure vessels, hundreds of tons each. There are very few forges in the world that can manufacture them (maybe 10, certainly less than 20), and they manufacture one now and then, so the prices are astronomical.The new designs either have much smaller pressure vessels (the SMRs), that can be manufactured for a cost exponentially lower, or have no pressure vessels (like liquid metal reactors or molten salt reactors).

In developing countries even less.So it sounds great but it&#x27;s completely misleadning of course.Globally wind and solar combined might be around 2%This is the mouse and the elephant all over. reply Symbiote 13 hours agoparentYou can easily find real numbers rather than invent some.In Portugal electricity was 25% of total energy in 2021, renewable energy covered 30.6% of gross final energy demand in 2019.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;portugal-2021 reply ThomPete 12 hours agorootparentSorry but those numbers aren&#x27;t really contradicting mine.Renewable energy in Portugal is mostly bioenergy and waste (Page 20)So yes lets look at the actual numbers.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iea.blob.core.windows.net&#x2F;assets&#x2F;a58d6151-f75f-4cd7-... reply tomohawk 14 hours agoprevAverage, overall, and other measures are unimportant when talking about electrical power. You need to look at worst case scenarios to understand how much capacity is actually required. So, over the course of a year, on what day did renewables supply the least amount? That would provide an initial indication, but would hardly suffice for long term planning.For example, if utility A supplies only 20% of required power from renewable sources on a given day over the last year, you can really only say renewables can be expected to supply 20% on any given day. But you&#x27;d need to do modelling or track over a larger number of years to get to the (likely lower) actual number. reply troupo 14 hours agoprevRight now it&#x27;s a calm night, so ~25% comes from hydro storage[0], 22% from hydro, 18% imported from Spain [1], and 16% from gas.I find these \"x % is now renewable\" useless without looking at actual numbers, and how they work not just in the best of cases.[0] Didn&#x27;t know Portugal had this much hydro storage[1] Spain right now is 37% gas, 23% nuclear, 17% solar, 12% windEdit: data from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.electricitymaps.com&#x2F;map reply Ekaros 14 hours agoparentI doubt Spain is 17% solar... As they are essentially same sun availability. reply capableweb 14 hours agorootparentYou think it&#x27;s too much or too little? Sun availability didn&#x27;t matter much in Spain until recently, as the country finally got rid of the \"sun tax\" that limited the development of wide-spread solar panel usage. Essentially, even if you used solar panels, you&#x27;d be taxed on every kWh produced, even from your own solar panels. Luckily, they got rid of it, so probably the development will ramp up a bit from now on. reply Ekaros 14 hours agorootparentIt seems surprisingly high for night time production. As I think original comment was about momentary production. reply Symbiote 13 hours agorootparentSpain has some heat-the-molten-salt power plants which continue to produce electricity after sunset. reply troupo 14 hours agorootparentprevI was surprised, too. Data is from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.electricitymaps.com&#x2F;map, so could be quite inaccurate reply Ekaros 14 hours agorootparentI somewhat suspect the data. Could be that there is some inaccuracies and it is also from earlier point of time reply polshaw 13 hours agorootparentThe time of the data is written there (right under where it says Spain)As of this moment it says 19:00 and 3% of electricity, which was before sunset, it was probably an hour or more earlier, and sun has been especially strong today. reply laurencerowe 13 hours agorootparentprevBetter data for Spain in 2022: Solar: 11.5% Wind: 22.7% Hydro: 6.6%https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;share-elec-by-source?coun... reply troupo 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not better data because it shows data in aggregate. replywott 14 hours agorootparentprev> You think it&#x27;s too much or too little?When it&#x27;s night in Portugal, it&#x27;s night in Spain :-) reply Kon5ole 13 hours agorootparentSpain has quite a few solar plants that generate power even at night. reply hutzlibu 14 hours agorootparentprevRight now the latest data is from 20:00 and it says 3.3% so when the comment above was made, the sun was shining a bit more.(But I think the sun goes down a bit earlier, but there are also the canarian islands as part of spain, way further south and west of the mainland) reply laurencerowe 13 hours agorootparentprevPortugal is on the Atlantic coast so has more wind and rain. A lot of inland Spain is pretty arid, making it ideal for solar. reply allears 14 hours agorootparentprevProbably the difference in solar installations. replywott 14 hours agoprev...and gets more and more dependant on neighbouring countries to produce the electricity Portugal consumes each time the intermittent renewable are down....and presents a carbon intensity over 4 time higher than France, despite the latter having a share of renewable 3 times lower. reply Jamustico 14 hours agoprevPortugal Caralho reply TheAlchemist 14 hours agoprev [–] That&#x27;s impressive !Does anybody can point me toward good sources about costs of maintaining those solar &#x2F; wind &#x2F; hydro installations ? I&#x27;m thinking about the solar panels, which I always thought have a limited lifetime (apparently it&#x27;s getting much better). Is this viable in the long term ? reply rsynnott 14 hours agoparentFor solar panels in particular, the answer is more or less shrug; for current common types estimates range from 25 to 50 years before efficiency drops off significantly, but obviously the technology was rather different 25 years ago so there’s no example of a modern-type solar panel that has worked for 25 years. Domestic panels often have a 25 year warranty.Of course, _useful_ lifetime may be a different thing. If you have limited space for panels, and in ten years efficiencies have doubled (current panels that you can actually buy are in the 20% range; current lab record is 47% for exotic types, so this at least seems _plausible_), then it may be more economical to just replace them early. reply thinkcontext 14 hours agoparentprevLazard&#x27;s regular comparison of levelized costs of electric generation technologies breaks down capital, operating, fuel, etc costs.In their latest PDF it&#x27;s pages 12 and 13https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;nltb551p&#x2F;lazards-lcoeplus-april...Also most solar pv manufacturers warrant their panels at 90% for 25 years. I don&#x27;t know if you consider that limited but to me that sounds pretty good. reply Gys 14 hours agoparentprevThe renewable energy in Portugal is not generated by private owners. Solar panels are not very common on residential buildings. reply thinkcontext 14 hours agorootparentWho mentioned residential panels? reply Gys 13 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m thinking about the solar panelsDoes not sound as industrial scale reply jeffbee 13 hours agoparentprev [–] Solar has a limited economic lifetime but it is in terms of centuries, not years. Panels just don&#x27;t degrade that quickly in practice, and even when they do degrade at higher rates than expected, it&#x27;s irrelevant to the economics of the projects. You&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a large-scale solar power station that has been retired, even among the oldest of them. reply TheAlchemist 9 hours agorootparent [–] So, this is what I don&#x27;t get. If this stuff is install once, profit for 25-50 years, how is it possible that electricity in Portugal is so expensive ? Something doesn&#x27;t add up here. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
