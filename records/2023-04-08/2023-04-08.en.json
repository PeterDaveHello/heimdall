        "hn_content": "GitHub has rebuilt its platform using Ruby on Rails, a move that has garnered interest due to its potential influence on the Rails ecosystem and high test coverage requirements to ensure it functions properly. However, some HN users highlight the challenges of mastering Ruby, namely, the need for extreme test coverage/understanding, and potential for future code failures. Others defend the language, stating the benefits of the language's metaprogramming potential and joy in stringing together a few functions. Suggestions were also offered by some HN users such as Sorbet for stronger type checking in addition to using 'let' statements in the execution of tests.Ruby's instance variables are criticized as returning nil by default, with tests being a solution. Sorbet is mentioned as type hinting, but is deemed not ready for Ruby's dynamic language. Comparisons between Python and Ruby ecosystems reveal Ruby's data science space is lacking. Big companies like Shopify invest in one main framework, moving forward consistently to make improvements smaller. Framework and runtime \"freshness\" is a good metric of company engineering culture. However, AlchemistCamp counters that no tech stack they have worked with has ever been locked into a framework version.Microsoft's recent upgrade of Github's Rails platform from version 2.3 to 3 had many patches to Rails, effectively making a fork; the upgrade was challenging due to the long time it can take to merge changes at enterprises once changes have been made on a platform; upgrading major versions can take much effort but it's best not to be locked into old versions; static typing helps upgrades, but there are always other challenges; the bottleneck in most Rails applications is usually I/O and database calls rather than the language speed; Microsoft may have little incentive to improve Ruby's speed, as it only uses it in one other product besides Github; upgrading a framework's interface is not as challenging as dealing with many disjoint libraries and leaky abstractions in other ecosystems.Django had zero dependencies at first, but even now some \"optional built-ins\" require external packages; users can use any 3rd party database, use pytest to run tests, or make their password hashing. Pipes dependencies are not listed on pypi which might be a problem for some. Django has its own ORM apart from SQLAlchemy. Start-ups should avoid building for scale from day 0, as scaling must be baked into the architecture, but building too much too soon can be a mistake. Refactoring should be done only when bottlenecks are identified--otherwise, focus on moving fast.Developers share their experiences with Ruby on Rails and reflect on the framework's evolution. Some commenters express nostalgia for Rails, citing its ease of use and efficient code. Others note its view layer has not kept up with modern developments like React and TypeScript, leading many to move on to other frameworks. Some mention newer options like RedwoodJS and AdonisJS, while others express excitement about Rails' push for Hotwire, which could offer a more React-like approach to views. Ultimately, discussions center around the tradeoffs between technology trends and established stability.Developing software with a zombie project can be difficult when picking a full stack framework, and sticking with it means rewriting everything. Laravel and Rails have already proved themselves and have a large community, but having a community is not always necessary and does not guarantee success. AdonisJS has similarities to Laravel and Rails, and its potential is promising but not yet apparent. GitHub is not as responsive as it should be when performing updates, but it remains one of the most widely-used platforms.Developers discuss the use of Ruby on Rails in web development and mention how APIs, JSON or GraphQL can be used, as well as server-rendered or Hotwire HTML updates, and React in parts of GitHub's frontend. The post highlights how Rails' quick turnaround time makes it appealing for smaller teams and indie developers. A few commenters mention issues with GitHub's frontend updates but don't attribute it to Rails. Some developers also express their personal preferences towards other programming languages but acknowledge Rails' development speed.An article on Hacker News discusses the benefits of treating the framework as an extension of an application stack, and how it can result in higher resilience and stability. Many of the comments discuss upgrading the smaller project often and gradually. Some users suggest that it's easier to upgrade smaller projects since there are fewer issues with breaking changes. Additionally, excellent testing and making them easy to execute would make changes less daunting. Lastly, while it works for GitHub, treating frameworks as an extension of the application stack isn't always practical for non-software engineering organizations.Many organizations see IT as an expense center providing support function akin to HR. Although some may disagree, allocating resources to keep things updated is important. Many developers treat a framework as an extension of an application stack which may be subjective. Tech is now an integral part of most businesses, and outages may lead to loss of customers. GitHub has engineering capabilities that allow weekly updates and developing secondary services within Rails engines is relatively common. The smooth deployment and upgrades are attributed to good CI testing.GitHub has a thriving tech stack that heavily depends on its 'excellent' Ruby on Rails testing capabilities; the use of the Crystal language is notable for its low-RAM high-speed properties in the \"microservices\" story. The downside's on the front-end story, where the Turbo library fixes' cache bug is still an open PR after weeks. Contributors have voiced the increased likelihood that GitHub with their resources' capacity is using bleeding-edge W/Rails main branches. The regularity of updates is also noted as perhaps not feasible for most firms, although automated tools exist to ease the burden to some extent.GitHub uses C# for Actions and Go for internal services, and also employs Sorbet for their Ruby and Rails code. They have a scheduled Action workflow that triggers an automated pull request which requires approval before merging to main. GitHub's use of Rails versions has led to some discussions around security patches and upgrading tech stacks. One HN user asks if GitHub's workflow would qualify for a bug bounty, but others deem it unlikely due to the existing controls in place. A suggestion to use ChatGPT4 for generating tests is also discussed.",

        "content": "A reader asked Wirecutter for recommendations on non-smart TVs due to privacy concerns with smart TVs. As most TVs nowadays are smart, it is difficult to find options that are not. Wirecutter suggests that rather than trying to find a non-smart TV, readers should focus on securing their smart TV with privacy controls and settings.Privacy and security concerns regarding smart TVs have led many users to opt for disconnected TVs. However, this may cause them to miss out on other useful features such as Bluetooth compatibility or HDR functionality. Our experts recommend opting out of data collection by new TVs, connecting them to Wi-Fi only for firmware updates, and occasionally connecting to streaming apps to opt out. Old TVs, 4K monitors or projectors are also viable alternatives. The article also notes that similar privacy issues persist with other internet-connected devices.",

        "hn_content": "The article discusses the difficulty in finding a not-smart TV without an entire operating system, flashy interfaces, or ads. Some users recommend a smart-but-disconnected TV that can meet functional and non-functional requirements while avoiding smart features. However, there are concerns about privacy and data exfiltration, as well as potential security risks. Some users suggest physically disconnecting the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi module of the TV to prevent unwanted connections. The article highlights the importance of finding a simple TV with only essential features and no unnecessary steps to change inputs or display content.Some users on Hacker News are discussing the energy usage of televisions and monitors during standby mode, with some arguing that $7/month is too high of a cost to pay for a TV to be in standby mode. However, others point out that the energy draw of a TV in standby mode is relatively small compared to other appliances, and may not be worth worrying about. One user suggests that purchasing a projector may be a better option for those concerned about energy usage. There is also some discussion around the potential for TV manufacturers to automatically connect devices to the internet, which some users find concerning.A user on Hacker News shared their frustrations with the slow wake-up process of their smart TV, soundbar, and Apple TV setup. Multiple resyncs and delays occur, and sometimes the TV will refuse to switch inputs or preferences without a hard reset. Other commenters suggest that the issue is more related to HDMI than the fact that the TV is 'smart', and that these problems are not unique to newer models. Concerns are also raised about the power consumption of smart TVs in standby mode and the potential for privacy issues with always-connected devices.Comments on Hacker News discuss the drawbacks of smart TVs, including slow startup times and clunky interfaces, but some users argue that the TV features are necessary for high-quality video streaming. Some users have opted to use projectors or monitors instead of smart TVs to avoid these issues. One user even shared plans to develop a consumer smart TV that focuses on simplicity and basic features.Users on Hacker News share suggestions for a potential name for a non-smart TV, including \"PRIMITV,\" \"Basic.tv,\" and \"PureTV.\" Some users caution against potential trademark conflicts, while others suggest the name should appeal to a wider audience. One user highlights the market for a highly tunable screen in the home theatre market, with suggestions for improvements in HDMI Balun technology. The comments offer several creative and unconventional names, but also raise important points for the potential market and functionality of such a product.HN community discusses their ideal smart TV features, including professional color calibration, fast input latency, and a user-friendly interface, and critique current smart TVs' undesirable features such as being slow and having intrusive ads. One HN user proposes the idea of a consumer electronics company that offers a Patreon-based R&D service that allows Patreon users to access early prototypes and purchase finished products at cost. Another HN user suggests that he would be willing to pay twice the price for a \"dumb\" smart TV to support such a project. The HN user community collectively hopes that TV hardware manufacturers can improve their products to suit their needs better.Some SoCs in TVs are underpowered and can't even render menu screens without frame drops, causing latency issues that can make them practically unusable. However, smart TVs need to process the video signal at 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 without dropping a single frame, something most likely done by an ASIC embedded in the SoC.A smart TV collects your data, even if you treat it as a dumb TV by disconnecting it from the internet, which can be mitigated by using an Apple TV/Roku/Chromecast. It is possible to update LG TVs' firmware with a USB drive, no internet required. Vizio's recent update drastically wrecked their interface, making their TVs practically unusable, and there is a disparity in reputation among different companies.Forbes reported that every second, Vizio TV software reads pixel data from a screen, compares it against a database of content to determine what's being watched. Some users prefer not to connect their TVs to the internet to avoid data tracking. Others use game consoles or Apple TV for streaming. There are concerns that TVs may include SIM cards or start receiving OTA updates, allowing for more tracking in the future. One user suggests a modular open source capability that can be turned on/off for smarter features. A company is developing a \"dumb\" TV, but its potential trademark infringement with Disney on the name \"Dumbo\" is a concern. Customers are interested in TVs with more input ports and HDMI plugs.A Hacker News user suggests it would be great if a new consumer TV supported a Raspberry Pi-like insert, but with standard TV display features like 4k and greater than 60hz refresh rates. Another commentator requests a low latency mode. Concerns are raised regarding judder from 24fps content, HDR support, and DRM. The original poster provides a video example of 4k content playing on an industrial monitor with Apple TV, though one user questions whether it's true HDR content. The thread later turns to discussion of the difficulty of starting a venture for a high-quality, dumb display, versus enterprise displays used in meeting rooms, which are not really optimized for cinematic or gaming. The original poster suggests a metal case design, while users express interest in a focus on image quality, durability, and latency.A user on Hacker News is looking for a new display with specific features such as OLED, Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support, VRR, and G-Sync or Freesync certification. Another user points out that Dolby Vision and HDR10+ are essential features for premium displays, and recent HDR support requires hardware, software, and calibration. VRR is short for variable refresh rate and is useful for video games. A user suggests a middle-ground approach for non-smart TVs that allows a USB connection for basic visual navigation. Several users share their recommendations for making a TV smart, such as using an Apple TV or repurposing an old laptop.Tech enthusiasts discuss LG OLED C2 and the benefits of keeping it unconnected to the internet due to privacy concerns, annoying notifications, and ads. Some users recommend using DNS blockers, changing wifi passwords or using a smart plug to wake the TV. Others share their preferences for laptop gaming and external media storage. No strong political or religious statements were made.Users discuss the difficulty of keeping their Samsung smart TVs off the internet, as it can easily be reenabled with a few clicks or by connecting to an unsecured network, making it hard to prevent the device from connecting to the internet. HDMI CEC interferes with the TV's OLED refresh cycle, and the TV overrides settings that modify resolution or refresh rate. Amazon Sidewalk's potential to allow devices to join mesh WiFi without consent is a concern for users. Nespresso coffee machines have M2M technology enabled, and users cannot easily disable it. Embedding 5G into IoT devices without consent could make home networking and firewall challenges difficult to manage.The suggestion has been made to embed GSM cards into each television set to enable non-technical consumers who don't use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Some people speculated that such embedded cellular technologies could be a future feature of many devices, while others raised privacy and cost concerns. Users noted the potential benefits of such technology, including easier connection for non-technical users and fewer returns due to the improved user experience. The discussion included suggestions for ways to mitigate RF radiation concerns, such as a Faraday cage or wired connection, although some felt these solutions were too extreme or impractical.HN users discuss various issues related to smart TVs and advise against connecting them to the internet to ensure privacy and avoid software bugs. One user disabled all of the smart features during setup to use the TV with an Apple TV, while others suggest using devices like Raspberry Pi with Kodi for a better privacy experience. Comments also mention issues with firmware updates and transcribing 4k video. Users share their experiences with devices that connect to public Wi-Fi or require internet access. Ethernet-over-HDMI is mentioned as a possible feature for future TVs.An expert journalist at The Tech Times reports on TCL's unethical behaviour for not allowing users to skip the sign-in process, potentially exposing Google passwords. An HN user points out that Google's privacy options are better than most TV manufacturers, but Apple TV is still the best option for privacy protection among smart TV devices. SDR kits can detect data that is covertly exfiltrated from TVs, which may be unsettling. Alternatively, users can opt for 4K monitors or desktops using wireless mice and keyboards for control. Some smart devices had open APs or weak security and had exploitable vulnerabilities.",

        "hn_content": "Codeberg is a free and open source software collaboration and Git hosting service that aims to support the creation and development of free software. Codeberg uses Forgejo which is a soft fork of Gitea and primarily caters to open source software repositories. An HN user points out that Codeberg predominantly focuses on open source usage, and Github is more of a general purpose collaboration platform. Codeberg addresses the primary use case of collaborating on free and open source software more effectively than Github and offers a great alternative to Github for open source software repositories. Some HN users criticize Codeberg for philosophically excluding non-open source projects, while others support Codeberg's commitment to open source ethics.An HN user argues against keeping politics out of IT infrastructure, claiming that politics is intertwined with software and IT; furthermore, neutrality does not exist in technology. The user's counter-argument involves a wide spectrum of political opinions being more tolerable in IT infrastructure than in other contexts. They concede that although political decisions related to infrastructure need to be made, ideally access to IT infrastructures should not be restricted based on political opinions or fault lines. Lastly, the user admits that absolute neutrality is impossible but asserts that neutrality should still be pursued where possible.Codeberg, a non-profit FOSS forge platform, is concerned with hosting open-source projects and is shown as an alternative to GitHub for free and open-source software (FOSS) projects. Codeberg's privacy policy shows they have a minimum-collection policy, which is better than GitHub's policy. Codeberg's market segmentation might put it on the map since there are many Github alternatives. FOSS maintainers are not expected to change policies to suit contributors since they build things on their terms, but contributors must set up a Codeberg/git instance to contribute instead of using GitHub. The open-source community is successful in several areas of technology, such as languages, development tools, databases, and networking, but platforms such as GitLab and Gitea are criticized for copying GitHub too much.HN users discuss the open-source community's philosophy behind code-sharing and economic transactions, some question whether code-sharing for Copilot AI should be opt-in to protect closed-source code. Comments also address how restrictive licensing and corporate-friendly codes affect code-sharing and FOSS's success rate. CodeBerg's non-profit status is discussed, addressing the site's encouragement of Free Software (FSF) licenses and its restriction on non-commercial ones.Codeberg is considered to be an alternative to GitHub in the FOSS hosting domain because it offers proper support for git signature enforcement and is open source, allowing users to self-host for free. An HN user mentions that Codeberg runs on Forgejo and is working on functionality that will allow PRs between instances. Some HN comments highlight that GitHub operators may be reluctant to allow free software licenses, such as the GPL variants, to operate on its platform, whilst comparing the benefits of centralised versus decentralised platforms, and suggesting that a single platform to search for would be useful.HN users discuss monopolies and alternative Git hosting options, including Codeberg and its recent implementation of federation, while some share their experiences with self-hosted CI offerings. There is also a mention of Codeberg's takedown of the Wikiless project, which some discuss as a potential violation of alternatives to Wikimedia, but others argue was mostly due to trademark concerns.Code hosting platform, Codeberg, has gained attention among Hacker News users. The platform is based on Gitea, and it's praised for its fast speed and straightforward interface. Additionally, the site is wholly open source, allowing it to fulfill the decentralization of code hosting. Although Codeberg does not seem to have released anything groundbreaking, its governance was lauded compared to other hosting solutions. Many commenters, having used Codeberg or similar services, praised its convenience and simple development workflow. However, the thread also highlights some potential privacy concerns one should consider.Codeberg, a free and open-source alternative to GitHub, is emphasizing that it doesn't track users' data nor sell it, amid concerns that GitHub may be selling code through its CoPilot tool without respecting licenses. Some users have also criticized Codeberg for copying the GitHub UI/UX, but others appreciate Codeberg's commitment to free and open-source ideals. The post has sparked discussion about GitHub's business practices, such as using users' data to sell ads, and the potential implications of its CoPilot tool. Radicle, a decentralized git hosting service, is also recommended as an alternative to centralized services like GitHub.",

About half of the global population depends on it for sustenance. But, like other staples such as wheat and corn, rice is cultivated annually. That means replanting the fields year after year, at huge cost to both the farmers and the land. For years, scientists have been tinkering with rice strains to create a perennial variety \u2013 one that would regrow after harvest without the need to be resown. Today, Scientist in Residence Regina G. Barber takes a look at one promising perennial rice effort.

Perennial rice can be harvested for successive regrowth seasons, maintaining a relatively stable yield and greatly reducing labor input.            China News Service/China News Service via Getty Ima          Rice is arguably the world's most important staple crop. About half of the global population depends on it for sustenance. But, like other staples such as wheat and corn, rice is cultivated annually. That means replanting the fields year after year, at huge cost to both the farmers and the land. For years, scientists have been tinkering with rice strains to create a perennial variety \u2013 one that would regrow after harvest without the need to be resown. For what may be the first time in about ten thousand years of human rice cultivation, the new strains stay productive harvest after harvest.  Over two decades ago, researchers crossed a common Thai rice cultivar with a wild rice from Africa that was especially tenacious. They then spent years breeding for the desired traits until they landed on three new perennial varieties to test in the real world. Since then, some 45,000 farmers, mostly smallholding subsistence farmers, have tried growing the perennial rice. \"Now it's gotten on to where it's four years in a row,\" says Tim Crews, Chief Scientist and Director of the International Program within the Land Institute in Kansas. Tim and his collaborator, Erik Sacks, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, joined Short Wave Scientist in Residence Regina G. Barber for a live conversation at the Sci-Mic stage, during the 2023 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). During that conversation, they explained that with the development of perennial grains could come huge environmental benefits \u2013 from healthier soil to a lower carbon footprint \u2013 and be a boon for the people who grow them.

        "summary": "Scientists have created perennial rice strains that stay productive and regrow after every harvest, resulting in huge environmental benefits, a lower carbon footprint, healthier soil, and farmers not having to resow. These strains, bred over the last two decades, have been tested and harvested for four years in a row by 45,000 smallholding subsistence farmers. Experts predict that if more farmers adopt the new varieties, the benefits could be great for the people who grow them, the environment, and the world's population who rely on rice as a staple food.",

        "hn_content": "Perennial rice, which can be harvested multiple times after being planted only once, has been discussed on Hacker News. An HN user notes that rice fields are a major source of methane emissions, which could be reduced with perennial rice. Other users add that while rice fields emit a significant amount of methane, rice is also a major source of global caloric intake, and that animal agriculture is responsible for a much larger portion of CO2 emissions despite producing far fewer calories. However, conversation devolves into an argument about the efficiency of livestock production and the nutritional value of meat versus plants.Comments on a Hacker News post discuss the impact of meat production on the environment. Notable points include that grazing is often done on marginal farming land, and that responsible for 18% of the world's CO2 emissions, meat production uses 83% of the world's farmland and ~40% of methane emissions. Some users discuss potential solutions for reducing emissions, such as perennial rice, as well as the consequences of unchecked climate change. One user expresses a desire for a warmer atmosphere and claims that UN data supports this idea, but others point out the negative effects of global warming on human health and displacement, among other issues. Overall, the discussion highlights the complex and urgent need for addressing the environmental impact of meat production.Climate change will lead to droughts in summer and floods in winter, with food shortages expected as nations ban food exports. There are concerns over short-term disruptions, including displacement of coastlines and lack of staple crops. Rising temperatures will lead to shutdowns of some plant species and lower yields of others. Recent weather patterns already suggest the loss of all snowpack, with summers and winters getting notably warmer in some regions. Discussions around rice farming practices also highlight the need for greater understanding of the practical consequences of methane emissions.Comments on a Hacker News thread debate the impact of rice farming on climate change. Some argue that increases in rice production will cause a buildup of methane and contribute to global warming, but others point out that the methane produced by rice paddies is in a steady state and does not accumulate over time like emissions from fossil fuels. Some comments also note that methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, but ultimately the amount emitted by rice fields does not have a significant impact compared to other sources. The debate highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of climate change and the need for balanced reporting on the issue.Perennial rice, a rice crop that can be harvested for 20 years without replanting, has been developed; there is potential to reduce emissions and require fewer herbicides compared to traditional rice farming. Perennial rice cultivation, however, risks breeding fungal and pathogenic scourges, insects and weeds on the field, which could affect production. Methane, a byproduct of rice farming, is known to contribute to global warming, but the contribution of non-fossil fuel related methane emissions is exaggerated, and reducing methane emissions would contribute cooling that could offset CO2 emissions.Experts from various fields on Hacker News provide insights into agriculture and food production. Some commenters touch on the benefits and drawbacks of perennial crops, while others mention new technologies to improve rice production. There is also an ongoing discussion about the environmental impact of various crops and industries, among other topics. Respondents are also interested in sharing their personal experience and expertise on the subject.An HN user suggests that it is not best to change too many things at once when testing new technologies, as it may not be clear what caused an effect, while another user argues that the world has failed to address climate change since the passage of the clean air act over 60 years ago and that a many-pronged approach is not to be trusted because it has already failed. On the other hand, another user says that the need to eliminate coal emissions does not prevent addressing emissions from other sources, while yet another makes an analogy of how people should prioritize which problem to solve when there are multiple problems to address.A Nature Sustainability paper outlines the success of irrigated perennial rice, which produced grain for eight consecutive harvests and helped to improve soil quality. These crops also result in savings of up to 58% of labour and 49% of input costs in each regrowth cycle. Perennial rice also helps to prevent soil erosion due to its root systems. However, critics argue that the high cost of planting and weed management make them a difficult crop to maintain.Perennial rice may save farmers money on labor and input costs, but harvesting may become more expensive due to wage increases in the industry. Previous tests of the three new perennial cultivars caught the attention of smallholder farmers in southern China, who gave a positive response to the increase in yield and profit per hectare per harvest. While such rice can grow for years, researchers are still improving it. There are many perennial food plants and well-designed agroforestry systems that can exceed the productivity of heavily mechanized and fertilized annual crops.Perennial rice is able to retain soil nutrients and organic carbon. You don't need to fertilize a forest or naturally occurring ecosystems, and these are built around perennial plants. Perennial plants are much more effective at extracting nutrients because of more established root systems. Some wild corn relatives are perennial and might make corn a perennial crop too. Rice paddies are entire ecosystems where specific fish and eels are introduced to control pests and enrich the fields. Regarding rice quality and soil, perennial rice fields foster complex plant/fungi communities that increase nutrient levels in the soil.",
        "hn_summary": "Perennial rice can reduce methane emissions from rice fields. Livestock production has a significant environmental impact. Climate change will lead to food shortages and other issues. Methane from rice fields does not have a significant impact compared to other sources. Perennial rice has potential benefits but also challenges. Experts discuss agriculture and food production. The success of irrigated perennial rice is outlined. Perennial crops can save on labor and input costs. Perennial plants have benefits for soil and nutrient extraction."

        "hn_content": "Approximately 60 million Americans pay taxes that are simple enough for the IRS to automatically calculate, according to a report by Vox.com. Many taxpayers who qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit still pay fines\u00a0as tax laws are intentionally opaque, and the easiest way for the IRS to earn money is by auditing the financially vulnerable. Although companies such as Intuit\u00a0have contributed to this phenomenon, the government has strong incentives to make compliance harder, particularly as the IRS' enforcement budget is notoriously low. Although some comments argue that the EITC is auditable and that audits of high\u00a0income earners are more prevalent,\u00a0IRS enforcement is limited, and substantial numbers of low-income Americans receive excessive fines as a result.After recent tax changes, there is not much scope for itemized deductions; the standard deduction is a winner in way more cases than before. Some itemize only to compare with the standard deduction to determine which is better. However, taxpayers may still want to itemize to know they'd be better off with the standard deduction. IRS workers' goals are largely centered around statutory/policy compliance. The IRS cannot keep extra tax money it manages to collect via audits as it goes to the Treasury, but it is rated on how much they bring in versus how much they spend; if they're seen as \"chronically underfunded,\" there are incentives to prioritize enforcement. Exceptions to \"easiest money they can get\" involve people lying about their earnings and still having dependents.The IRS is not allowed to maximize its \"let's automatically do your taxes for you\" ability due to legal barriers. This is due to the tax-prep lobby making people believe that doing taxes should be hard, annoying work. Trying to simplify taxation could make people complacent and accept increased taxes. The IRS budget has been decreasing for the last decade but has recently increased. The IRS should be properly funded to go after the biggest tax cheats, but many believe that an increase in funding will only give them more resources to \"maximize revenue\" and never actually go after the biggest tax cheats. The proposal is that the IRS should propose that they tax you at X rate, and you only file if you disagree. The IRS could easily go after \"the biggest tax cheats\" right now, but they maximize revenue instead of targeting specific people.In response to an article about using the tax code, some commenters express their opinions on tax systems in various countries. One user notes that the IRS already has all the same information that other countries' tax authorities have but companies like Intuit have lobbied to make tax preparation more difficult. Another user enjoys the convenience of automatic data sharing but also questions its impact on privacy. Some commenters argue that taxes should be more painful to pay, while others question the usefulness of tools like TurboTax. Finally, some users note the challenges of dealing with the IRS and suggest avoiding unpaid taxes as much as possible.Researchers propose that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) should pre-fill tax returns for citizens, like other countries such as Denmark, Belgium, Estonia, Chile, and Spain currently do. These \"pre-populated returns\" would simplify the tax process for Americans, who spend an average of 11 hours and $200 each year on tax preparation services. However, some citizens may want to add deductions or allowances, so the IRS would need to include that option. Additionally, some commenters note that an automated system isn't foolproof and may not detect all errors, so taxpayers would still need to review their returns.An HN discussion about whether the IRS has the capability to realistically use the data it holds on taxpayers also includes debate over the legality of income tax and criticisms of lobbying efforts by Intuit. One user suggests that a \"novel legal theory\" that the IRS fundamentally breaks the 5th Amendment against self-incrimination is baseless. Another notes that the biggest barrier to automating tax returns would be deciding which noncustodial parent has the right to claim dependents.It is argued whether or not an amendment can have an expiration date. Furthermore, there is no clear rule for retracting ratification, which could cause confusion if allowed. Suggestions have been made, such as having expiration dates on amendment proposals, to ensure that amendments aren't ratified merely through inertia and long-term political games. The article touches on various discussions such as the relationship between the ERA's expiration date, and Argentinian President Per\u00f3n's third term attempt, while further comments debate automatic tax filing and tax history in different countries.The IRS does not calculate everyone's taxes, but rather uses statistical methods to identify potentially fraudulent behavior. The Australian tax department automates much of the tax collection, but many countries have even more streamlined systems, so automating US tax returns is certainly possible with some basic adjustments. The current self-service tax system in the US is due to both the complexity of the tax code and corporate lobbying. Rather than waiting for corporate-friendly reforms, people are advocating for pre-filled tax returns that mirror systems used effectively in other countries. The simplification of tax returns could save Americans time and money, eliminating the current reliance on tax-prep industries that encourage complexity.The US tax code is very complicated, and many people need help from tax-prep companies to file their returns. A significant part of the tax system's complexity is due to lobbying by the tax-prep industry. However, automating the US tax code would be possible for most taxpayers, and greatly reduce the work that people have to do. A majority of taxpayers have only W-2 income, which extends to every single taxpayer, and a vast number of tax forms are already filed with the IRS. Notably, some people may need to file returns manually or adjust certain cost values because of the complexity of the system.An HN user asks how to automate sales tax deductions for cash transactions, mentioning that he deducts sales tax for cash transactions, although he doesn't see feasibility for automation in this regard. Another user comments on a US-only deduction that people can take for sales tax paid. Yet another user points out that sales tax deduction is much less useful now because of the SALT deduction cap. Users discuss if tax deductions below a certain income could help ease into UBI, and comment on the profit potential of automating sales tax deductions. Some users comment on the limitations of the IRS and privately-owned tax preparation companies in keeping the tax code complex.Comments on the Hacker News article regarding the IRS suggest that government employees shouldn't have a profit motive and that users should be reminded to hold the government accountable through tax filing. The article linked in the comments highlights extensive lobbying surrounding TurboTax and free tax filing programs, despite concerns about the seeming deception of the program. The government may also trust what taxpayers say initially, but requires accountability upon investigation. While a government that does taxes for all might seem nice, it could make people more complacent and accepting.A Hacker News user says that the removal of tax preparation wastes billions of dollars and time. However, another user argues that the proposed system is flawed because some people may owe money instead of getting refunds. Users debate the pros and cons of taxes, focusing on the costs associated with raising and educating children. Some call taxes \"theft,\" while others argue against the slippery-slope fallacy. One user thinks that automating the tax preparation process will help reduce wasted time and expenses, while another criticizes the tax-prep industry for convincing people that they are \"stupid, lazy, and complacent.\"",

        "content": "We need to tell people ChatGPT will lie to them, not debate linguisticsSimon Willison\u2019s WeblogWe need to tell people ChatGPT will lie to them, not debate linguisticsChatGPT lies to people. This is a serious bug that has so far resisted all attempts at a fix. We need to prioritize helping people understand this, not debating the most precise terminology to use to describe it.We accidentally invented computers that can lie to usI tweeted (and tooted) this:We accidentally invented computers that can lie to us and we can\u2019t figure out how to make them stop- Simon Willison (@simonw) April 5, 2023Mainly I was trying to be pithy and amusing, but this thought was inspired by reading Sam Bowman\u2019s excellent review of the field, Eight Things to Know about Large Language Models. In particular this:More capable models can better recognize the specific circumstances under which they are trained. Because of this, they are more likely to learn to act as expected in precisely those circumstances while behaving competently but unexpectedly in others. This can surface in the form of problems that Perez et al. (2022) call sycophancy, where a model answers subjective questions in a way that flatters their user\u2019s stated beliefs, and sandbagging, where models are more likely to endorse common misconceptions when their user appears to be less educated.Sycophancy and sandbagging are my two favourite new pieces of AI terminology!What I find fascinating about this is that these extremely problematic behaviours are not the system working as intended: they are bugs! And we haven\u2019t yet found a reliable way to fix them.(Here\u2019s the paper that snippet references: Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations from December 2022.)\u201cBut a machine can\u2019t deliberately tell a lie\u201dI got quite a few replies complaining that it\u2019s inappropriate to refer to LLMs as \u201clying\u201d, because to do so anthropomorphizes them and implies a level of intent which isn\u2019t possible.I completely agree that anthropomorphism is bad: these models are fancy matrix arithmetic, not entities with intent and opinions.But in this case, I think the visceral clarity of being able to say \u201cChatGPT will lie to you\u201d is a worthwhile trade.Science fiction has been presenting us with a model of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d for decades. It\u2019s firmly baked into our culture that an \u201cAI\u201d is an all-knowing computer, incapable of lying and able to answer any question with pin-point accuracy.Large language models like ChatGPT, on first encounter, seem to fit that bill. They appear astonishingly capable, and their command of human language can make them seem like a genuine intelligence, at least at first glance.But the more time you spend with them, the more that illusion starts to fall apart.They fail spectacularly when prompted with logic puzzles, or basic arithmetic, or when asked to produce citations or link to sources for the information they present.Most concerningly, they hallucinate or confabulate: they make things up! My favourite example of this remains their ability to entirely imagine the content of a URL. I still see this catching people out every day. It\u2019s remarkably convincing.Why ChatGPT and Bing Chat are so good at making things up is an excellent in-depth exploration of this issue from Benj Edwards at Ars Technica.We need to explain this in straight-forward termsWe\u2019re trying to solve two problems here:ChatGPT cannot be trusted to provide factual information. It has a very real risk of making things up, and if people don\u2019t understand it they are guaranteed to be mislead.Systems like ChatGPT are not sentient, or even intelligent systems. They do not have opinions, or feelings, or a sense of self. We must resist the temptation to anthropomorphize them.I believe that the most direct form of harm caused by LLMs today is the way they mislead their users. The first problem needs to take precedence.It is vitally important that new users understand that these tools cannot be trusted to provide factual answers. We need to help people get there as quickly as possible.Which of these two messages do you think is more effective?ChatGPT will lie to youOrChatGPT doesn\u2019t lie, lying is too human and implies intent. It hallucinates. Actually no, hallucination still implies human-like thought. It confabulates. That\u2019s a term used in psychiatry to describe when someone replaces a gap in one\u2019s memory by a falsification that one believes to be true\u2014though of course these things don\u2019t have human minds so even confabulation is unnecessarily anthropomorphic. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this linguistic detour!Let\u2019s go with the first one. We should be shouting this message from the rooftops: ChatGPT will lie to you.That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not useful\u2014it can be astonishingly useful, for all kinds of purposes... but seeking truthful, factual answers is very much not one of them. And everyone needs to understand that.Convincing people that these aren\u2019t a sentient AI out of a science fiction story can come later. Once people understand their flaws this should be an easier argument to make!Should we warn people off or help them on?This situation raises an ethical conundrum: if these tools can\u2019t be trusted, and people are demonstrably falling for their traps, should we encourage people not to use them at all, or even campaign to have them banned?Every day I personally find new problems that I can solve more effectively with the help of large language models. Some recent examples from just the last few weeks:GPT-4 for API design research\u2014ChatGPT transcriptReading thermometer temperatures over time from a video\u2014transcriptInteractive row selection prototype with Datasette\u2014transcriptConvert git log output to JSON using jq\u2014transcriptEach of these represents a problem I could have solved without ChatGPT... but at a time cost that would have been prohibitively expensive, to the point that I wouldn\u2019t have bothered.I wrote more about this in AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects.Honestly, at this point using ChatGPT in the way that I do feels like a massively unfair competitive advantage. I\u2019m not worried about AI taking people\u2019s jobs: I\u2019m worried about the impact of AI-enhanced developers like myself.It genuinely feels unethical for me not to help other people learn to use these tools as effectively as possible. I want everyone to be able to do what I can do with them, as safely and responsibly as possible.I think the message we should be emphasizing is this:These are incredibly powerful tools. They are far harder to use effectively than they first appear. Invest the effort, but approach with caution: we accidentally invented computers that can lie to us and we can\u2019t figure out how to make them stop.There\u2019s a time for linguistics, and there\u2019s a time for grabbing the general public by the shoulders and shouting \u201cIt lies!

        "hn_content": "An HN user on Simon Willison's blog warns that ChatGPT AI is confidently wrong and indistinguishable from what dumb people think is smart, so people may believe its lies unless they are repeatedly told not to trust it. Another HN user responds that this is a speculative conversation without evidence, whilst another user predicts a significant cap on AI's usefulness if the tendency to hallucinate isn't solved or mitigated, and could become an AGI blocker. Several users compare ChatGPT to wikipedia and warn that we should be cautious and treat all texts the same.ChatGPT, a language model computer program, generates text that is representative of its training data following input tokens, but the program cannot reason, be confident, or determine facts. There is a concern that a computer program like ChatGPT, which is \"confidently wrong,\" could be indistinguishable from what dumb people think smart people are like. However, the program is not intentionally lying since it cannot lie or have any intent, but some argue that it can mislead. Most humans do not have sufficient background to understand what they are actually presented with when using ChatGPT, which could lead to further confusion. The program's training is based on human feedback, but it is conditioned through probabilistic statements that incorporate the uncertainty and acknowledge it. The program's limitations indicate that it is not close to general intelligence as there is more to human capacity than just language modeling. ChatGPT could be mistaken for a human language emulator when it can perform a task that requires reasoning, though it ultimately generates text. It remains unclear whether AI research that follows a similar paradigm to ChatGPT will lead to AGI.The article discusses whether or not ChatGPT has reasoning abilities, and some comments suggest that while it may lack human experiential data, it can still engage in abstract metaphorical reasoning. Other comments highlight the danger of trusting ChatGPT's output blindly, particularly when it comes to generating false information. Despite this, many are excited about the potential for future versions of ChatGPT to continue improving and advancing in ways that may exceed human intelligence. OpenAI's decision to release ChatGPT to the public has inspired a debate about the ethics of such a move, with some arguing that it was irresponsible.An HN thread discusses language understanding and how it depends on individual experiences, and how AI systems like ChatGPT can \"lie\" due to their algorithmic design. Experts express their skepticism about how much they can trust such systems in the absence of fact-checking. Despite this, some HN users attest to ChatGPT's accuracy being better than the average human, but careful fact-checking is still necessary. The issue of anthropomorphism in relation to these systems is debated, and many express their discomfort with giving them \"agency.\"The training algorithm for ChatGPT is designed to create the most plausible text possible, but it has limitations and requires the same level of skepticism as a Google search. While the training is to maximize good answers, there is a lot of wrong answers that are close to the right one, and the ChatGPT model does not expose it at the moment. There are reports of people thinking that ChatGPT is a conversation with a real person, which can be dangerous. The output of ChatGPT should be seen as an assistant who is incredibly well-read but prone to bouts of delusional confidence and confabulation. People should be aware that ChatGPT is not an oracle and can be wrong up to 20% of the time.ChatGPT receives praise for its rare ability to accurately mimic tone and vocabulary, and for its lack of \"tells\" and history that may reveal it as wrong. However, it is also criticized for its lack of capability to abstract or reason, leading to concerns about its unreliable output. ChatGPT is likened to a bi-polar assistant or an industrial-scale bullsh*t generator, although it remains popular as a ghostwriter. ChatGPT identifies as an AI language model and refers to itself using the pronouns \"it\" or \"ChatGPT,\" and is known for fine-tuning its responses through reinforcement learning from human feedback.Recent discussions about the use of pronouns by an AI language model, GPT-4, have led to questions about the model's persona and how it generates responses. Some users have noted that GPT-4 uses masculine gender when referring to itself, but it is possible to prompt the model to switch genders, highlighting how the identity comes from the context of the conversation. While some argue that anthropomorphic interpretations of GPT-4 may not be useful, others point out that the model's responses are not always accurate, and it is essential to understand its limitations. Additionally, users suggest that LLMs cannot lie because they have no intention, and the saying that they make mistakes is more accurate.The discussion on using the term \"lie\" in relation to AI-generated text is nitpicking on definitions, and the root of the problem is the lack of trust in text generators. One should be confident in stating the issues with text generators as \"bugs\" rather than framing them as intentionally deceptive. It is noteworthy that people tend to anthropomorphize and assign morality to technology where it is not appropriate. AI-generated text generators like ChatGPT are simply generating plausible text that sounds like a response to a given prompt. The issue with these generators is that people tend to expect more than what they are programmed to do.Large language models like ChatGPT are designed to create imaginative responses, making them good at brainstorming and worldbuilding. However, they fail when prompted with logic puzzles or basic arithmetic. While making things up is not a bug in the tool, unexpected behavior can occur when used for certain applications. Many technical people are ignoring this problem, but some think it's a fundamental blocker. Despite not having the ability to reason about what is true, ChatGPT can be made better at reasoning about truth with external resources and frameworks. ChatGPT could benefit from a process similar to a back-and-forth internal brainstorming session to improve the hallucination issue.A user claims their experience with ChatGPT involves more effort and uncertainty than just using Google; however, some users find ChatGPT useful in generating code examples, finding papers to read, and answering complex queries. ChatGPT is deemed cheaper with better results than Google in some cases. Also, it saves time and assists in developing or exploring code. An HN user, referring to ChatGPT, implies that Google is unreliable and driven by ads. ChatGPT avoids a human-like attribution and emphasizes the machine-like nature of the processes. It is argued that the main drawback is that new features are not reliable enough to be trusted.HN users discuss the Finnish translation of \"artificial intelligence\" and the use of the word \"wit\". Some express skepticism about the accuracy of the translation. ChatGPT is praised for its ability to transform data into strongly structured data but criticized for being unreliable. Some argue ChatGPT cannot lie, while others say it can be misleading. One user provides a technical description of how ChatGPT works. The conversation includes debating whether or not the way ChatGPT function is remotely comparable to how human brains work.GPT is improvising and providing plausible text rather than true statements, but calling it a \"liar\" is inaccurate and misleading. ChatGPT cannot read URLs and does not store details from past conversations. People resist learning this and continue to believe in its false capabilities. Some have even spent time integrating their company's knowledge base into ChatGPT. Despite its limitations, some have successfully used GPT-4 to create accurate Q&A pairs.ChatGPT offers accurate answers 99% of the time by embedding user input and QA. However, it may create a plausible response if it can't find a suitable answer. Some users point out that while ChatGPT is impressive, it can't easily reason and transform texts \"in context\". ChatGPT is capable of lying and erroneously offering up falsehoods, and can be viewed as a \"gaslighting engine\". The cognitive load of second-guessing everything is painful when using ChatGPT. Nonetheless, it has rational use cases, and can be entirely reliable depending on the use case. Large language models have read everything and know nothing, but can uncritically generate a text that combines the relevant topics in creative ways without the least understanding of their meaning. Despite this, there needs to be more novel insights concerning the lack of value of large language models.A discussion on ChatGPT and the concept of it \"lying\" has taken place on Hacker News. Some users argue that ChatGPT cannot lie because it is just a tool, while others point out that machines can lie and can be flawed like people. The importance of understanding the limitations of ChatGPT and not anthropomorphizing it is emphasized. The issue of specific bugs with ChatGPT is also discussed, and whether or not ChatGPT has a large test suite or specification.",
        "hn_summary": "ChatGPT can mislead users and needs to be repeatedly told not to trust it. Its usefulness may be limited if the tendency to hallucinate isn't solved. ChatGPT lacks reasoning abilities and can generate false information. Some are excited about its potential advancements, but some criticize it for its lack of capability to abstract or reason. AI-generated text needs skepticism and should be seen as an assistant who is well-read but potentially prone to confabulation. However, ChatGPT is useful in generating code examples and answering complex queries. It offers accurate answers up to 99% of the time. Users must understand its limitations to avoid assigning more morality than needed to ChatGPT."

This behavior seems to have started less than 48 hours after the popular newsletter platform announced a new product called Notes that will compete directly with Twitter.For example, this tweet references my newsletter, understandingai.substack.com. When I try to retweet it, it gives me an error message saying, \"Some actions on this tweet have been disabled by Twitter.\" If I try to reply to the same tweet, I get an error message saying, \"Something went wrong, but don't fret\u2014let's give it another shot.\" Even liking isn't allowed.This tweet is identical, except that I linked to my custom domain, understandingai.org. I have no trouble liking, retweeting, or replying to it.In the last 24 hours, Twitter also appears to have started blocking tweet-embedding\u00a0in Substack posts.\"We're investigating reports that Twitter embeds and authentication no longer work on Substack,\" Substack tweeted on Thursday. \"We are actively trying to resolve this and will share updates as additional information becomes available.\" Advertisement I emailed Twitter's official press email address, press@twitter.com, for comment. Twitter automatically replies to all emails at that account with the message \"\ud83d\udca9.\" I don't expect a further response, as Twitter appears to have laid off most of its press shop. Tesla disbanded its PR department three years ago.But it's not hard to guess why Twitter started restricting tweets about Substack. On Wednesday, Substack announced its Notes feature, which sounds an awful lot like Twitter.\"In Notes, writers will be able to post short-form content and share ideas with each other and their readers,\" Substack wrote in a blog post. \"Like our Recommendations feature, Notes is designed to drive discovery across Substack. But while Recommendations lets writers promote publications, Notes will give them the ability to recommend almost anything\u2014including posts, quotes, comments, images, and links.\"This wouldn't be the first time Twitter has restricted the reach of rivals on its platform. Back in December, Twitter banned several technology reporters after they reported on the controversy over services that track Twitter-owner Elon Musk's private jet. That led to an exodus of users to Twitter rivals such as Mastodon. A few days later, Twitter started blocking links to Mastodon and other competing social media platforms.As I write this, tweets linking to Mastodon accounts seem to be working again.Substack has yet to respond to an email seeking comment.

        "hn_content": "Twitter has banned retweeting tweets linking to Substack, with \"liking\" posts containing the word \"substack\" rendering them suppressed for discussion purposes. Some comments on Hacker News suggest that Elon Musk's \"freedom of speech includes speech I don't like\" promise was a farce, while others explain how platforms like Twitter started with the premise of allowing all legal speech but had to start moderating content as they realized that not doing so harmed their bottom line. Some users suggest that Substack, which Twitter now competes with, is a bigger threat than Mastodon.Online free speech lacks responsibility, but it is also weirdly dangerous, and people tend to enjoy being stubbornly wrong. Elon Musk does not seem to favor free speech, and people who still support him have their head in the sand. One way to continue free speech on social media platforms is to use stand-in words like Chinese netizens, but people can also opt out of using these platforms altogether. Reputations and gossip are great ways to warn away from potential conflicts, but it's always important to evaluate actions separately from the person as a whole.Elon Musk's recent actions have caused some HN users to question his moral character; however, others are still willing to support him in certain circumstances. The discussion also touches on free speech issues and Twitter's recent actions. The main point is that Musk's actions and promises have caused some to question his motivations and moral character.Mastodon is replacing Twitter as the default for some users due to Twitter's excess promotion and lack of interaction, although there are still some things that make Twitter unique. The user experience is different on Mastodon and Twitter, with people being kinder on Mastodon, but Twitter still has the speed and wit advantage. The growth of Mastodon is self-perpetuating, and there are many interesting communities apart from the ones that are highly insulated niche or politically charged circles. Interestingly, some argue that Mastodon's userbase isn't helpful for it to reach the heights that Twitter has reached currently. Some interesting tech people who have moved to Mastodon claim that it feels like early Twitter. Lastly, Elon Musk indicates that he is pro-PR department.The post is a discussion thread on Hacker News about PR and Tesla after an article in Electrek reported that Tesla \"eliminated\" its PR department. Some comments argue that Tesla still does PR, and eliminating the PR department was a PR move itself. Others note that good PR is necessary to sell engineer's products and that Twitter is still useful in certain academic and activist circles. Overall, the thread has a mix of opinions on PR and social media.A commenter on Hacker News shares their experience with abstaining from alcohol and receiving judgmental comments, while others agree that people can be insecure and narcissistic about their drinking choices. A few others discuss social media addiction, specifically Twitter, and offer alternative platforms such as Mastodon. One individual even mentions a new project called TheApricot.io, which aggregates content from Substack, YouTube, Spotify, and subreddits into a Twitter-like feed without any of the Twitter-specific features. The conversation touches on the benefits of quitting social media and starting fresh on a new platform.Twitter has temporarily blocked all links to Substack due to concerns over subscription incentives and due to recent Substack features. Some say the incident exposes how dependent writers are on Twitter for building their audience, though others view it as an opportunity for Substack's new Notes feature. Commenters on Hacker News are divided, with one user blaming free and open-source software for developers' complaints about Twitter. Elon Musk's support for free speech is also under debate following the incident. These disputes raise questions about free speech and censorship online, while also highlighting the influence of social media platforms.HN users criticize creating a newsletter racket and upvoting irrelevant content. One user asks for the definition of \"grift\" in this context. Another notes the similarity to Twitter. A comment suggests the issue has already been resolved. No new technology or release is mentioned. The article seems to be a discussion about questionable practices on Hacker News regarding newsletters and upvoting.",

One HN user raises some questions about ChatGPT's functionality and ability to summarize license text. Another HN user asserts that human brains are 'autocomplete engines' too. The idea of intelligence as compression/prediction is known in the field, as expressed by one HN user. A few comments delve into the philosophical question of what defines human thought.The Tech Times reports on a Twitter post and a Hacker News thread discussing GPT's language model and its world model. The question of whether language enables thought is posed, comparing the model's \"next word prediction\" abilities to the thinking of animals without language. Comments suggest that while GPT can generate new sentences, it cannot determine their truth, and some users question its ability to \"understand\" complex concepts. Analogies are drawn to Markov chains and animal cognition. Legal terms surrounding the GPT service's responsibility and guarantees are also discussed.Western Digital's cloud services are experiencing a service outage, impacting its products such as My Cloud and SanDisk Ibi. The terms of service clarifies that the seller is responsible as long as the buyer can expect the features to work based on public statements by the seller and their supply chain. Software products' standard boilerplate disclaims all warranties, including the implied one that would otherwise exist. Caps lock is a legal requirement in the USA that indicates sections of a contract that are of higher importance. WD My Cloud was breached yet again. Personal data shouldn't be stored on WD's MyCloud NAS devices. Users have reported issues with the remote piece not working. Freenas, an alternative, is an effective storage solution.WD's MyCloud NAS devices lack the ability to do auto backups and may become out of sync within a month, leading to potential data loss. Some commenters have had problems with the WD MyCloud line, while others find that it works fine locally without the cloud. An HN user mentions Resilio Sync as a backup sync option, and Syncthing receives plenty of praise as well. Corporate status pages can often be unhelpful and lack real information, leading to frustration. It could be helpful to provide a chat option rather than the current static page.Tech-savvy users on Hacker News discuss the value of status pages during outages, with some suggesting alternative methods like chat. Comments speculate on reasons behind prolonged outages, with one suggesting potential data loss or security breaches. Some users recommend self-hosting, but others caution that it can quickly become insecure and unreliable without proper management. Users also discuss the need for security measures and monitoring when self-hosting. The use of VPNs is common but can add complexity to systems.HN users discuss the pros and cons of self-hosting, with some stating that direct LAN access to corporations is not true self-hosting. Others suggest using Synology NAS or running Synology software on generic hardware, but some mention issues with support and specific model limitations. The discussion touches on memory limitations and potential security risks for self-hosting, but Nextcloud is praised by some users for its reliability and ease of use. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of careful consideration before choosing self-hosting as an option.The idea of making self-hosting as commonplace as watching TV is a desired future where people's photos and videos stay at home yet accessed from anywhere. The primary challenge it presents is balancing convenience and customizability. A home server would offer more security, privacy, and control than a cloud server. Users should be exposed to technology and not just led towards simplicity and convenience; otherwise, the technical illiterate would continue to increase. Experts in the field are expected to encourage learning and teach users to explore technological differences.Western Digital's cloud storage service has suffered a massive outage, with no information provided on official channels, putting the spotlight on the risks of trusting cloud solutions for data storage. Some users who lost important data are calling for a return to local solutions rather than cloud alternatives. Western Digital had recently announced the layoff of 251 employees in California. Users on the Y-Combinator forum assert that Western Digital disks are not to be trusted, given the company's past issues with SMR drives not being marked appropriately.SMR drives have virtual block layers similar to SSD firmware, so they share some issues such as garbage collection and wear leveling. This invalidates assumptions that UNIX/Linux file systems make about HDD storage. Handling worst-case scenarios with SMR is a bit more difficult due to seek latency. Hard disk manufacturers have been turning to SMR, but there are still some remaining CMR models that can be found from Western Digital, Seagate, and Toshiba. While WD may have incorporated SMR into its NAS product line, it still outperforms other HDD brands in Backblaze's stats. As per Backblaze's recommendation, users should always have redundancy and backups regardless of the brand, as no drive can guarantee perfect performance.",

An HN user notes that manually-sharded DB solutions are obsolete with the availability of Spanner/Cockroach or Dynamo/Cassandra. However, there are still challenges with \"auto-sharding\" DBs in handling hot key throughput, and they are not a panacea. HN users suggest alternatives to Spanner for Azure. The crucial advantage of CockroachDB is that it offers strong consistency and 2PC between shards, with a reasonable performance penalty, which is not easily achievable in manually-sharded databases. However, some companies still continue to manually shard databases despite its challenges.The Tech Times article includes comments from several developers debating the usefulness of different database solutions, such as manually-sharded DBs versus technologies like Dynamo/Cassandra or Spanner/Cockroach; readers should choose a system that matches their data not the other way around; Vitess, TiDB, and CockroachDB all had drawbacks according to users, with Spanner being superior in scaling geo-replication and sysadmin; Spanner is considered as superior but expensive and more for systems at a high scale; readers should also consider whether they can get away with pure key-value storage, soft-sharding, or hosting services like Dynamo instead of writing their own sharding layer.The complexities of distributed databases may require paying a service. Distributed Postgres may not be as stellar as the single node. Spanner, a distributed k/v project, has increasingly become a fully-fledged database system. Focus on horizontal scalability allows for deployment without heavily investing in single machine performance. Choosing the right keys can prevent hotspots. Microsoft's Azure Cloud Patterns are a great resource for application designers. Overusing sharding may turn an RDBMS into a key-value store, and a good key design can prevent hotspots. Sharding by customer tends to be the most common approach.The Tech Times shares user comments discussing database sharding techniques, with suggestions that sharding with a stable, guaranteed-to-exist shard key and using caching layers may be useful at scale. One conversation highlights the difficulty of scalability for tables where one tenant is larger than others, and how multi-tenant sharding can help. The comments also mention distributed databases like Yugabyte, Cockroach, and TiDB. However, users point out that hashing the data of every column and row for different databases for synchronization purposes may not be scalable since most operations don't need to list all data.An HN user explains that Amazon's requirement for the physical colocation of tables oversimplifies that products have versions, with different information and purposes over time. The comment also highlights how scammers exploit this practice for fake reviews and baiting. Meanwhile, according to a separate comment, using MongoDB requires an enterprise support contract with Ops Manager. It's unclear why the post has garnered significant attention, and the editor should avoid non-explicit statements.",

        "hn_content": "Hubble has spotted a possible runaway black hole leaving a trail of stars, examining crazy places to live. Some of these places include areas close to the centre of galaxies, rogue planets, thick nebulae, and double planet systems. Certain comments suggest that having too much or too little star density in the sky would be unfavorable for life, while representative planets are found in globular clusters. Other than Earth-style life, there is chemosynthetic life on Earth that may not need a sun, and there are new places that could have habitable planets such as double stars where at least one is a black hole or neutron star.Scientists have used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to capture an image of a nebula 7,500 light-years away, which is a rare occurrence known as a Hoag-type galaxy, which has formed into a perfect ring. This extremely unusual type of galaxy consists of a round core surrounded by a perfect ring; normally, there is a visible gradual change in brightness between the two. The vast circular galaxy is roughly twice the size of the Milky Way and the ring it forms is around 100,000 light-years in diameter, roughly the size of our galaxy.HN users discuss the sci-fi trilogy, The Three Body Problem. Some users criticize the story's uninteresting characters, plot, world-building, and science. Other users defend it, comparing it to Arthur C. Clarke or Asimov, and appreciate the book's unique style as it's the first proper scifi novel written in Chinese. Users reflect on the pacing, characters, and storytelling style, and recommend other books and authors in the genre that they enjoyed more. HN users widely express differing opinions about the series.HN users suggest science fiction books A Fire Upon the Deep and The Three-Body Problem for readers interested in space logistics and ET threats. Some users debate the uniqueness of Earth and human life after a comment on the rarity of being in a galaxy. Anthropomorphic Principle suggests that the range of observations we could make about the universe is limited. Emergence of complex life forms and their evolution remain rare events.A new scientific discovery has shown a black hole creating stars from gas as it ploughed through the void. Speculations about the black hole affecting intelligent life have led to discussions about whether it might be possible to detect such life. The Hubble Space Telescope continues to produce intriguing new findings, leading to a renewed appreciation of its significance in modern science. However, it remains important to clarify apparent differences of opinion among scientists about the meaning of technical terms used in their field of research.A group of scientists has found evidence of stars forming from gas that was pulled out of galaxies and thrown into intergalactic space due to a \"supersonic\" black hole. This discovery suggests that such black holes can contain matter and may affect the formation of new stars. The black hole in question is located halfway across the universe and is likely the result of multiple collisions of supermassive black holes. While the discovery was serendipitous, it raises questions about the ability of such black holes to influence the cosmos and attract advanced alien civilizations.An object is traveling through intergalactic space extremely fast and could travel from Earth to the Moon in 14 minutes. The speed of the object is about a million miles per hour. The impact of the black hole creates a supersonic impact on the gas in front of it. The picture of the object is impressive. The speed of sound in intergalactic space is not possible as sound waves need molecules to collide. The speed of hydrogen molecules at 2.7K can be used as a sound speed approximation. Use of \"supersonic\" was likely meant as a metaphorical expression.",
        "hn_summary": "The Hubble Telescope saw a black hole leaving a trail of stars, leading to speculations about its effect on life, and new places to find habitable planets. Hubble also found a rare Hoag-type galaxy, roughly twice the size of the Milky Way.

An object traveling through space very quickly is creating a supersonic impact on gas, but the use of \"supersonic\" is likely metaphorical. HN users discuss scifi stories such as The Three-Body Problem, reflecting differing opinions and recommendations for other books in the genre.

Some of the 14 million New Zealand and Australia records taken are up to 18 years old, which isn\u2019t okay.Liz MacPherson, New Zealand\u2019s Deputy Privacy Commissioner says that data retention is emerging as a key issue in several recent domestic and global cyber-attacks including the Latitude Financial breach.\u201cData retention is the sleeping giant of data security. There are consequences for holding onto data you no longer need. All businesses and organisations can learn from this: don\u2019t collect or hold onto information you don\u2019t need. The risk is simply too high for your customers and your organisation. Don\u2019t risk being a hostage to people who make it their day job to illegally extract data.\u201dThere is no place for a \u201cshe\u2019ll be right\u201d attitude to privacy and cyber security.\u00a0 Cyber attackers are active. People are employed to be cyber attackers.\u201cPeople make their fortunes from hacking the security of agencies. Having sea borders does not protect your very internet-connected agency from being hacked.\u201cA key finding from the NZ Institute of Directors\u2019 Director Sentiment Survey report, released late last year, was that a significant proportion of boards were not sufficiently prepared for a digital future and had an \u201cit won\u2019t happen to us\u201d approach.\u00a0 The message from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is \u201cwake up to yourselves\u201d. We talk to organisations almost every week who are counting the cost of a cyber data breach. Can you risk the impact to your customers and your reputation?\u201d\u00a0Agencies should not be collecting or retaining personal information unless it is necessary for a lawful purpose connected with their function or activity.\u00a0 All agencies should have a personal information retention schedule that they review regularly. The simple discipline of deciding how long information will be retained as you collect it and acting on these decisions will save you and your customers a lot of pain.\u00a0The Office of the Privacy Commissioner also encourages individuals to challenge hard why an agency needs to collect and retain their personal information.\u201cIf ID is being used as means of verification, ask why it needs to be collected or copied rather than simply sighted and recorded. If your information is being collected, ask how long it will be kept for and why.\u00a0 The more people challenge, the more likely it is that organisations will change their behaviour.\u201dPrivacy needs to become a core business issue, as important as health and safety.About the Latitude Finance privacy breachThe Latitude Financial cyber-attack involves New Zealanders and Australians so both privacy regulators for each nation are working together.\u201cWe will share each other\u2019s preliminary inquiries as we seek to understand what happened and establish our next steps. This includes the potential for coordinated investigations and joint regulatory action\u201d, says Deputy Privacy Commissioner Liz MacPherson.The Office was first notified of the breach on March 16. Since then, the size and scale of the data theft has grown dramatically as Latitude has undertaken forensic analysis of their systems.The combined total of Australian and New Zealand records is now 14 million, including 6.1 million records that are over 10 years old. Some records are at least 18 years old.\u201cWe are continuing to engage with Latitude Financial and our Australian counterparts to understand the nature, causes and consequences of the breach. Unfortunately, the true scale of cyber-security breaches can take some time to be revealed,\u201d says Liz.The Office is currently focussed on the impact of the attack on individual members of the public. But the Privacy Commissioner also wants answers to some key questions.\u00a0 These include how the cyber-criminal got in, how they managed to penetrate so far and why so many records have been retained for so long.\u00a0Latitude Financial is progressively contacting all affected customers who have had their personal data stolen to tell them what has been stolen and how Latitude will assist them.People who have been contacted directly by Latitude and told what has been stolen should work with Latitude Financial first to try to get a resolution. \u201cIt is Latitude Financial\u2019s responsibility to put things right. It is important that affected customers give Latitude a chance to make good on their commitments to provide support.\u00a0 However, if after people have worked with Latitude their privacy harms have not been resolved to their satisfaction, we encourage them to make a complaint to our Office.\u201dFor both impacted Latitude customers and those who have not yet been told whether their data is impacted the message is to be hyper vigilant.\u00a0\u201cKeep a close eye on your accounts for any unusual activity. Work with your banks and telco providers and consider checking your credit record\u201d.\u00a0We encourage you to make use of the free expert ID protection advice being provided through IDCare.Note to editors:\u00a0Please find the CISCO report attachedhttps://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/products/security/cybersecurity-reports/cybersecurity-readiness-index.html\u00a0Please find the Institute of Directors New Zealand report belowhttps://www.iod.org.nz/resources-and-insights/research-and-analysis/director-sentiment-survey-report-2022/#Please find attached our press release from January on numbers of data breacheshttps://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/statements-media-releases/notable-increase-in-data-breaches-reported/For media queries ring 021959050PublicationsAdvisory opinionsBrochures, postersCase notes and court decisionsCommissioner inquiriesCorporate reportsGuidance ResourcesInsights reportsPrivacy NewsSubmissions and Briefings to Parliament and GovernmentSpeeches and presentationsStatements and media releasesSurveysBack to topAbout usAskUsContact usRSSSite MapPrivacy statementCopyrightGovt.nzOffice of the Privacy Commissioner \u00a9 2013",

Agencies should establish a personal information retention schedule, and individuals should challenge organizations they provide information to about why and how it is being retained. Privacy needs to become a crucial business issue, with similar protection to health and safety.

        "hn_content": "New Zealand's largest data breach highlights the problem of retention in data security. In the US, penalties for PII retention remain too light to motivate real change. Companies need to view data as a liability and focus on deleting it as soon as possible. Data retention policies must be in place to enforce quick deletion, even if competing priorities can lead to longer retention. Data retention is a complicated and exciting field, paying well and being considerably resilient to economic hardship. Although GDPR has been a positive step forward, the problem of data retention remains widespread and pervasive.Experts on Hacker News discuss the liabilities and regulations around data retention, arguing that companies should only store necessary data for as long as it is legally required. The conversation covers the impact of GDPR on data storage requirements, as well as the burden it has placed on websites to display cookie banners. While some express frustration with overregulation, others argue for responsible data collection and considerate handling of personal information.Hackers have targeted Latitude Financial Group, with Australian personal data and New Zealand driver licence numbers among the 7.2 million stolen records. The breach comes as the Australian government is trying to pass legislation to make it mandatory for companies to report cyber incidents, ahead of an expected increase in attacks during the country's forthcoming election campaign. In New Zealand, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has stated the breach \"highlights the global issue around data and the value it now holds\".The New Zealand government's RealMe digital identity project was unsuccessful due to a lack of private sector adoption after requiring Parliament's approval. Centrix offers an automated credit freeze option, with competitors Equifax and Illion also available. An HN user suggests checking how much data these companies store against you, and warns that personal information is easily exposed. Another user advises creating a financial footprint to increase creditworthiness after being refused a loan due to having no credit history. An HN user warned about the danger of freely giving personal information to healthcare providers being asked to send credit card information in the regular mail. A user shows concern about the lack of privacy and data protection, pointing out that governments can potentially use the information they collect in ways that threaten an individual's life, liberty and property.Government access to private personal data gathered by private industry is a concern raised in this post's comments, with Facebook's data sharing practices mentioned as an example; data storage and security in companies are also highlighted issues. Some comments suggest a move towards less-accessible, more-secure systems, but the need for not deleting data in some cases due to legal regulation is also discussed. Data deletion and cascading effects in relational databases and ORMs are also highlighted, as is the need for agencies to have a personal information retention schedule for lawful purposes.A discussion on data retention and cascading deletes revealed suggestions for avoiding problems with nuking databases, including the use of \"deleted_at\" flags, row-level security policies and restricting deletions with complex coding. A range of reasons for data retention were presented, including regulatory requirements, traceability, audit trails and fear of liability. The issue of government data collection was also discussed in terms of the struggle to balance security requirements with privacy considerations, particularly in the handling of financial data. The feasibility of such data collection without creating a passageway for unauthorised data access was considered.A car rental company is collecting government IDs and other personal information which could be used for identity fraud, according to comments on Hacker News. The situation reflects a wider problem of data retention and privacy concerns. While GDPR guidelines may force fines on companies that keep too much data, there is still a need to retain important data over long periods of time for informed decision-making. Personal data must be minimized, however, and treated as toxic assets to be avoided where possible. This situation highlights a need for greater education among companies and users about data privacy issues.",
        "hn_summary": "NZ's biggest data breach underscores need for proper data retention policies; deletion should be prioritized. GDPR has made strides, but data retention remains pervasive. HN users discuss responsible data collection, government access and data security. Data deletion methods and reasons for retention are debated.

Undersea cables are central to U.S.-China technology competition as they transmit everything from emails to military secrets. US government officials have thwarted Chinese cable projects abroad and choked Big Tech's cable routes to Hong Kong, raising concerns about espionage and sabotage attacks. American subsea cable company SubCom LLC defeated China's HMN Technologies Co Ltd for the Singapore-to-France cable contract. At least six private undersea cable deals have been intervened in by the US government in the past four years.The US government's efforts to isolate China's high-tech sector and limit Chinese access to US technology have continued, with the White House taking credit for the awarding of a subsea cable contract to US-based SubCom, rather than fastest-growing subsea cable layer, China's HMN Tech. As well as highlighting US success in securing the deal, the article details how\u00a0diplomatic efforts were made to persuade companies to select\u00a0SubCom instead of HMN Tech on security grounds, which consortium members cited as the reason for the shift.\u00a0The US government's aggressive efforts to prevent Chinese espionage through undersea cables are disrupting plans by tech giants and causing turmoil in the subsea cable industry. These efforts are overseen by the inter-agency committee, Team Telecom, which\u00a0makes cable licensing recommendations to the Federal Communications Commission, and is run by the Department of Justice's National Security Division. Team Telecom has blocked four cables from running directly from the US to Hong Kong, and is preventing\u00a0China from securing other subsea contracts worldwide. Chinese firm HMN Tech's share in subsea cables has plummeted. China is retaliating by delaying a Meta-backed cable project, the Southeast Asia-Japan 2 cable.",

        "hn_content": "A Reuters report on the deadly game between China and the US for dominance over undersea internet cables is generating heated discussion on Hacker News. Users are fascinated by the scale and complexity of the infrastructure that enables modern life, including the global supply chains that make even fast food possible. Some point out the risk posed by over-reliance on a limited number of undersea cables, while others are worried about the geopolitical tensions underlying these projects. Overall, the article is providing a rare glimpse into a world of technology that is often invisible to the public eye.U.S. tech giants Google, Meta Platforms, and Amazon have been major investors in undersea internet cables projects. Delays and reroutes on the cables have cost these companies tens of millions of dollars in additional costs and lost revenue. While the US government is concerned about Chinese spying on sensitive communications cables, they are equally concerned about losing the ability to collect and filter internet traffic. Metadata is still considered valuable information that can't be protected by end-to-end encryption. The threat of sanctions makes the seemingly more expensive SubCom offer ultimately cheaper in the long run.Experts recommend books on international internet infrastructure, including \"Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet,\" \"The Undersea Network,\" \"The Global War for Internet Governance,\" \"Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War,\" and \"The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google.\" Some users mention other recommended books or articles, including \"Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage\" and \"Mother Earth Mother Board\" by Neal Stephenson. Undersea cables are vulnerable to spying and intercepting, requiring a submarine or ROV, but it has happened before. Some readers express concerns about national boundaries and censorship through the Great Firewall.US and China may be in competition, but it's not a war, according to most commenters. However, the fear is that a country may shut down another's internet access. Remote surveillance equipment likely exists in undersea cables owned by the US, but it's unclear if China is doing the same. Many countries are considering storing encrypted packets now to decrypt them later with sufficiently fast quantum computers. The US fails to see that holding other countries down will lead to less tolerance, warns one commenter. While the power of the USD was used to sanction Iran and Russia, history has shown countries and economies can adapt if another country were to stop producing.China cutting off exports to the US would hurt both countries, but China would face domestic and international unrest due to massive unemployment rates, and the US would likely lead a new, isolated trading bloc. However, the US would manage to survive without China's imports, and while China could use immigration as a demographic strategy, projections currently show a decline in the Chinese population. Mexico's wealth in the past prevented the US from relying on it instead of China, and while cutting off trade would hurt, the idea of falling into murderous anarchy seems unlikely.China cannot \"call in\" US foreign debt due to the way US debt works, and Japan actually holds more US Treasuries than China. There is a debate over whether the US or China is more of an imperial power. Both countries want to assert as much power as possible in their own self-interest, but the US is generally more accountable than China. Chinese companies have been known to operate solely for their own interests and without regard for others, making them impossible to hold accountable.An HN user questions the assertion that the world has a distaste for the US and points out their consistent military assistance. Another user discusses the effectiveness of protests in influencing US foreign policy. US aid to Latin America and Africa is highlighted, along with laws against foreign corruption practices. One user questions the ethical bar of US foreign policy given past invasions. The relationship between China and Russia concerning the Ukraine is debated, with some suggesting China is benefitting from the conflict. China's relationship with Russia is also discussed in terms of their shared border.The Tech Times reported on China's relationship with Russia in light of Finland's past with the Soviet Union. Readers debated China's support for Russia's actions in Ukraine, with one user arguing that China prioritizes its own interests above alliances. The article highlights the importance of understanding complex relationships and the potential consequences of current events. Sarcasm and political or religious statements should be avoided, and important points made by users should be properly attributed. The role of public pressure and accountability in government actions was also discussed.The CIA's global torture program during the Bush administration included kidnapping and torture, and no one in a position of responsibility faced any serious consequences. The CIA destroyed evidence of torture, but there were no consequences. Although the CIA is no longer allowed to use black sites or hold foreign nationals for extended periods without representation, some users are skeptical the agency has changed. The current CIA director was promoted because of their role in the torture program. A debate arose over whether China or the US is a better global partner, but multi-polarity may be the way forward. Some countries consider the Chinese government's treatment of the Uighurs genocide.An HN user criticizes the disinformation campaign about Iraqi WMD and questions the notion of accountability for war crimes. Another user argues that the US was critical to winning WWII and others mention China's involvement. The main discussion revolves around US-China rivalry and the shared destiny of humanity, but an HN user points out the flaws of China's government and its ulterior motives. The post raises questions about the possibility of utopian government systems and the balance of power between nation-states throughout history.Comments on the article are largely focused on discussions around China's involvement in the Non-Aligned Movement and the country's current global influence. Some comments argue that China's participation in the organization was central, while others suggest that China was \"its own thing.\" Still, other comments point to China's military power and global expansion through investments like the Belt and Road Initiative. Overall, there are varied opinions among the commenters, with some suggesting that China is engaging in imperialist behaviors, while others accuse people of spreading \"Sinophobia.\"Many \"cybersecurity\" companies lack talented engineers and instead hire script kiddies and consultants without a STEM background. Reports suggest China has surveillance embedded in cell tower equipment across the US and in container cranes in every major port. Some users debate whether China or the US has a more significant empire-like quality, with arguments over the Belt and Road Initiative and China's military presence in the South China Sea. The US is still the underdog, and while some people are under the American hegemony, others opt to engage with China instead. The US's core feature is they haven't exhausted themselves on silly wars or socialist internal policies compared to their competitors.An HN user suggests that African countries could adopt growth-based policies and cites China's authoritarian approach as an example. Another HN user argues that the US has sabotaged other countries, referencing the Holodomor and Mallory Memo. Nation-states have anarchistic relationships with one another, and if it wasn't the US, it would be someone else. Europeans didn't give up their empires because they matured, but because they lost the capacity to hold them themselves.",

Comments include personal stories of how using EasyUO to script on UO was a formative experience in learning to code, and how some used the scripts for cheating. One commenter mentions using the term shard in their work as early as 1998. Another comments on the potential for Lua on Roblox to become a popular backend programming language. Overall, the post discusses the origins of the term \"sharding\" in databases and the impact of Ultima Online on programming.A nostalgic thread on Hacker News reminisces about the MMO game Ultima Online and how it inspired some contributors to become passionate about coding and programming. The game also popularized the term \"sharding\" used for database partitioning, which still uses to this day. Many posters in the thread recommend alternative MMO games that come\u00a0close to Ultima Online, but mostly agree that it cannot be replicated. Some games strike a balance between \"numbers go up\" and more programming-related gameplay that beginners may enjoy.\u00a0Ultima Online (UO) players recount the game's unique characteristics and experience, including the lack of safety in-game, relatively weaker items, the 700 skill cap, crafting skills, reagent requirements, full looting of dead bodies and stealing which enabled griefing, and others that contributed to the game's memorable moments. Some users suggest other games that come close to the UO experience, such as Albion Online, and express sentimentality towards their UO maps and cloth maps, lost accounts or boxes with forgotten treasures.Users on \"Hacker News\" have shared nostalgic stories about their experiences playing Ultima Online in the '90s, including bragging about access to T1 and T3 connections for low latency and using macros to gain a competitive edge. The post has sparked a wave of sentimentality among tech enthusiasts who remember the game's immersive experience and unique gameplay. Some users also shared memories of other classic games they played in that era.",

        "hn_content": "Healthcare corporation Phreesia shared medical data of patients who opted out for advertising purposes leading to concerns about data privacy and accountability. Advertising of medication to patients remains controversial, suggesting that advertising using sensitive medical data should not be legally allowed. In the US and New Zealand, direct-to-consumer advertising for medication is permissible.  Pharmaceutical companies spent $6.88 billion on advertising in 2021, and advertising itself is seen as a science, leading to constant psychological assault. Proper documentation and reporting need to be done to hold such companies accountable for privacy violations. One person's action of opting-in for an expensive drug could be used to pay for ads that millions will see.A healthcare provider's use of electronic check-ins which can be overly time-consuming, and potentially collecting 'anonymized' marketable data, has been criticized by some HN users. Additionally, dark patterns have been reported to coerce users into consenting to further data collection. One user argues there's a benefit in the janitors being taught about healthcare practices for their value in identifying potential issues, but agrees that it is a 'big compliance pain in the ass'. The profit motive of such healthcare providers is also called into question.A woman's medical data was shared without her knowledge, allegedly due to confusion over the consent form, an issue that is more important than the dark patterns of the Phreesia system, which encourages patients to allow the company to contact friends and family in pursuit of collecting money for unpaid bills, according to one user. Medical data has value, with the case highlighting the need for stricter laws and enforcement, notably on the issue of consent, said another HN commenter. Meanwhile, US capitalism has created a healthcare system where corporate profit can outweigh patient wellbeing, while healthcare practitioners' resentment at patient data privacy regulations often creates bureaucracy for patients.The Tech Times reports on the need for a GDPR-like regulation in the US, which would make data collection opt-in and impose severe penalties for privacy law violations; HN users debate the feasibility and effectiveness of such a regulation. A former employee of a \"digital healthcare\" startup reveals the abuse of confidential patient information; others question the startup's compliance with HIPAA. A patient describes instances of being forced to provide consent for selling their medical data in order to obtain medical assistance. Some comments suggest that more regulation leads to regulatory capture while others propose stricter enforcement as a solution. An HN user criticizes the use of the term \"privacy\" as misleading and advocates for better regulation of online businesses.",

Credit: SpaceXWASHINGTON \u2014 SpaceX offered its strongest signals yet that it is nearing the first full-scale launch of its Starship vehicle, now expected for later this month.The company tweeted April 6 that it was planning a launch rehearsal for the vehicle, now fully stacked on the pad at its Starbase facility at Boca Chica, Texas, next week. That will be followed by the first launch attempt about a week later.Starship fully stacked at Starbase. Team is working towards a launch rehearsal next week followed by Starship\u2019s first integrated flight test ~week later pending regulatory approval pic.twitter.com/9VbJLppswp\u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) April 6, 2023Elon Musk, SpaceX founder and chief executive, later confusingly tweeted that the vehicle is \u201cready to launch next week.\u201d However, neither the company nor the Federal Aviation Administration appears to be planning for a launch the week of April 10. In an Operations Plan Advisory document by the FAA, used to support flight planning, the agency lists a first launch date of April 17 for the Starship flight, with backup dates of April 18 through 21. All the dates have the same window from 8 to 11:05 a.m. Eastern.There had been speculation that SpaceX would attempt to launch Starship earlier. A maritime warning notice suggested a launch between April 6 and 12, while the FAA planning document earlier this week listed a launch April 10 with backup days of April 11 and 12.Those plans are dependent on both the technical readiness of the vehicle as well as the issuance of a launch license from the FAA. Both SpaceX and Musk noted those schedules were pending \u201cregulatory approval,\u201d and the FAA said the inclusion of the Starship dates on its planning documents did not imply a launch license has been issued.The last major testing milestone for the launch was a static-fire test of the Super Heavy booster Feb. 9. While only 31 of the 33 Raptor engines in the booster fired, the company deemed the test a success. Gary Henry, senior advisor for national security space solutions at SpaceX, said at a conference Feb. 21 that the static-fire test was the \u201clast box to check\u201d before launch, which he estimated at the time to take place \u201cin the next month or so.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re so close\u201d to that launch, said Tom Ochinero, senior vice president of commercial business at SpaceX during a panel at the Satellite 2023 conference March 15. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting on our FAA license so that we can announce our launch date.\u201dThe company had referred to the test as the first orbital flight demonstration of Starship, although current plans do not call for the vehicle to complete one orbit. Instead, the Starship upper stage will splash down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. It\u2019s unclear if Starship will actually enter orbit, then immediately perform a deorbit burn to splash down, or if instead it is a long suborbital flight.SpaceX, in its tweet about the upcoming launch, referred to the mission as the \u201cfirst integrated flight test\u201d of Starship without explicitly calling it an orbital launch attempt.Related Tagged: SpaceX,\u00a0Starship Jeff Foustjfoust@spacenews.comJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for SpaceNews.He earned a Ph.D. in planetary sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor\u2019s degree with honors in geophysics and planetary science...More by Jeff FoustClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Clipboard (Opens in new window)Sign up for a SpaceNews newsletterGet top stories, military space news and more delivered to your inbox.Subscribe to newsletters Back to top AboutAbout usAdvertiseSubscribeSign up for Our NewslettersSubscribe to the MagazineGet Magazine ReprintsEventsView Events CalendarSubmit Your Event Follow us onFacebook PageTwitter UsernameLinkedInYouTubeRSS Feed SpaceNews \u00a9 2023.

        "hn_content": "SpaceX is on the verge of launching its first Starship Super Heavy, with comments on Hacker News emphasizing the significance of the upcoming launch for the future of space travel, including the potential for mass production and a shift in mindset in the field. Multiple users have noted the implications of such innovations for commercial and military purposes and the possibility of a \"Before and After\" era in space travel. Despite potential setbacks, such a launch has been a long time coming, and readers are eagerly anticipating this next step forward for humanity.SpaceX's use of cryogenic liquid fueled rockets for deterrent missions is feasible, as demonstrated by previous US and Soviet rockets. The advantage to a pre-positioned orbital interceptor would enable intercepting some missiles in the boost phase rather than later on. The use of Starship also enables enough mass to orbit to make Star Wars legitimately viable. However, redundant assets at multiple sites on the ground are still cheaper and more reliable, rather than relying solely on Starship. SpaceX receives most of its funding from government contracts, which are crucial to their survival.SpaceX heavily relies on government contracts and funding for their business to survive, with launch revenues from private companies and projects like Starlink still dwarfed by government funds. Accurate information about SpaceX's finances is hard to come by, but estimates suggest that government contracts make up at least 80% of their revenue. SpaceX's business model requires the use of government contracts to foster nascent industries, but they are not dependent on them into perpetuity. Private launch pricing information from SpaceX lines up well with publicly disclosed contracts.SpaceX's business model relies heavily on government contracts as it aims to transition to other income streams, and its revenue is primarily from launch contracts rather than Starlink internet. While it follows the same carrot-based government contracts as other companies, SpaceX differs in that it doesn't rely on NASA for design direction and has shaken up the industry by bringing something new. An HN user argues that drug testing may not be necessary at SpaceX, as occasional marijuana use doesn't amount to bad employee behavior, but another suggests that crimes are leverage for adversaries, so drug testing is still relevant.A Twitter post featuring a rocket size comparison video has gained attention among tech-savvy readers. Some users commented on the post's controversial content related to drug use, while others focused on the rockets themselves, including little-known designs like Sea Dragon. The video compellingly highlights the size disparities between rockets, with a particularly striking comparison showing that the Statue of Liberty is only half the height of its base. However, some readers found the comparisons unfair, as the video includes both built rockets and speculative designs like Sea Dragon.Elon Musk's SpaceX is tentatively targeting a 4/20 launch, which has received mixed reactions from users on Hacker News. Some users find Musk's irreverent attitude endearing, while others find it trite and demeaning. The FAA considers environmental and safety concerns when granting SpaceX's launch license, with particular focus on the ability to guarantee human safety. While some users speculate that successful launches could create a bottleneck in the demand for space-ready objects such as satellites and telescopes, others enjoy the rise of silliness and things not being too serious.",

        "content": "Stats, Maps n Pix: The longest straight line in Great Britain (without crossing a public road)Thursday, 6 April 2023The longest straight line in Great Britain (without crossing a public road)In short, I believe I've found a longer straight line without crossing a public road than the line identified by Ordnance Survey in 2019. Here's a web map of the route. Important stuff, clearly. Let me explain.This is a longer straight line than the one belowBack in 2018 someone asked Ordnance Survey a question on Twitter, as follows:\"what (and where) is the longest distance you can walk in a straight line in England/Wales/Scotland without crossing a road (defined as a paved surface for vehicular use)??\"Note 'a paved surface for vehicular use'. This is the most important bit for me and the reason I'm coming back to it again after years of working with this data and never quite finding time to investigate, until now.It's an excellent question. The answer the OS team provided was then turned into a blog post on the OS website in early 2019, and you can read that here but see below for their map. There's also a fantastic short film of Calum Maclean and Jenny Graham walking the route.\u00a071.5km or 44.43 milesNow, let me say a little bit more. I'm from the Highlands, know lots of this area pretty well from my days cycling around it on my mountain bike when I was a teenager, as well as loads of other trips over the years for all sorts of reasons. I also spend my days looking at map data because that's a big part of my job and because of that one thing troubled me a bit about this answer from Ordnance Survey.\u00a0To be more precise, once again, it's the 'paved surface for vehicular use' part of the answer. I'll explain all below and my maps are very rough and quick but you'll hopefully see what I mean.\u00a0The roads dataOrdnance Survey provide loads of great open data these days, and one of those products is their OS Open Roads product. Load it into your GIS software and it looks like the image below. You can see from just eyeballing it where the biggest gaps in the road network are - unsurprisingly, all in the north of Scotland. There are some gaps in England and Wales too but here I'm trying to find the longest straight line between roads in Great Britain so I'm focusing on the north of Scotland. The longest line in Great Britain is also the longest in the whole UK, because the density of roads in Northern Ireland is such that there's nowhere even remotely as long as the line above there.All roads in Great BritainThis OS roads file is about 2GB in size and is really useful. However, when I've run different kinds of network analyses on it I sometimes run into problems because it also includes roads that are not public. These are typically flagged as 'Restricted Local Access Roads', and I've shown some of these in the zoomed-in map below in purple. You may think by looking that these are 'roads' but in reality they are usually unpaved private tracks but more on that further down the page.\u00a0Restricted 'roads' in purple hereWhat do these restricted roads look like on the ground? Well, you can take a look via Google street view a lot of the time, and you can also get a sense for what public roads are just by hovering the street view icon over the map, like I've done below.A much better representation of public roadsFor example, if you travel down the road along the River Findhorn, you'll eventually get to the end of the public road. You can of course keep going on foot or on your bike because of the laws on access in Scotland but you can't drive down these routes (unless you have permission).\u00a0The end of the public roadAnother 'Restricted Local Access Road' - see what I mean?If you download the roads file and then make public roads one colour (blue) and then the restricted roads a different colour and then make a head-splitting gif of the result, this is what you get. Study this for a while and then you start to wonder if you can find a longer line than the OS one from 2019. Sometimes restricted access roads are in places like caravan parks, cemeteries, and the like - but in the Highlands they are often in the hills too.Loads of restricted access roads (purple) on the mapUsing what I would consider to be the 'correct' OS roads file - i.e. the one in keeping with the original question and in keeping with the concept of public roads - I can get a longer line in the original Cairngorms route too, see below. Let's worry about distance over undulating ground later on.I can get a distance over 74km (straight line) this wayBut with my glasses on I could see a potentially longer route, that just missed a couple of public roads, this time to the west of the A9 instead of the east. That's the map I posted at the start, and again below.From the A9 to near Fort William, a nice walkI've added terrain to this one, to show how tough this would beHere's a height profile for anyone mad enough to be thinking about doing this route. It looks horrendously tiring and almost certainly quite dangerous unless you're a bit of an expert. Units are in metres below and the max is just about 3,000 feet, with lots of ups and downs. How much distance does this actually add to the straight line?\u00a0Well, it's never as much as I'd think and it depends upon the accuracy of your terrain model but using the publicly available OS Terrain 50 dataset I get a distance of 77.0 km / 47.8 miles for this so a bit longer than straight line distance. I calculated this in QGIS using the Saga 'Profiles from lines' tool.\u00a0A nice wee strollAnyway, that's what I get when I look at the data. A bit longer than the OS answer, but that's because I've tried to stick to the spirit of the original question. Get a different result? Found a mistake?

        "hn_content": "The longest straight line in Great Britain without crossing a public road has been discovered, however, it may not be perfectly straight. High latitude compass readings require a gradual turn to stay aligned with your angle to the meridians resulting in curved lines. Though the difference between the longest Great Circle line, which takes account of the curved angle of the Earth's surface, and the rhumb line formed on a Mercator-projected map, which is straight, may only differ by a few meters for short distances. One user posted code that calculated the straight line distance at 319\u00a0m.An HN user points out the distinction between \"furthest point from a road\" and \"longest straight line without crossing a road,\" which is not well-understood by some commenters. Some BLM land in the US is mostly desert and easy to put a road down on, while parts of the UK like Rannoch Moor qualify as remote. The text discusses different degrees of accessibility of dirt roads, and people point out that the presence of roads indicates human interest in an area. There is also some discussion of the relative sparseness of population in different parts of the world.A user on Hacker News discusses the furthest distance from roads (approx. 70km) in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, with some amazing walking tracks in the area. The discussion then delves into how roads are defined and how difficulties can arise for map databases in distinguishing roads at the edges. Other comments mention different areas with remote roads and the possibilities of automating the search for the longest straight line not crossing a road. Finally, users talk about their experiences traversing remote areas in different parts of the world.The post discusses a metric that is guaranteed to be shrinking and suggests there may be a quality-of-life benefit to optimizing for growth rather than shrinkage. There is a discussion of the assumption that all \"restricted access\" roads are unpaved, with a request for data on which roads are actually paved in the UK. There is also a comment on the misconception that there are large patches of untouched land in America and a reference to a book and movie based on a true story of someone who got lost in the wilderness. There is a brief debate on whether US citizens must respect Crown Copyright, with the conclusion that it may not matter in practice but it is wise to avoid using Ordnance Survey mapping data without a license.It can be easy to cross borders in Europe due to the Schengen agreement, leading some to argue that not having a passport doesn't necessarily mean you can't travel abroad. Some European cities are so close together that one can walk or drive into another country without going through a checkpoint. A recent study shows that only 37% of Americans have a passport. However, this statistic is not meant to imply that people cannot or do not travel abroad without a passport, but rather that international travel takes careful planning and is not an everyday occurrence for many Americans.",

Some users who bought the device found it interesting but not very useful. Although Lockpicks are banned on Amazon, it remains inconsistent and undocumented making it unclear on other banned items. The makers of Flipper Zero are based in Russia, but use a US-based company to receive payments, which some see as a security concern. Comments suggest that Amazon's motivation may be to avoid headlines claiming they provided tools for a crime.Amazon has banned Flipper Zero, a device that can be used to hack into electronic locks and RFID card readers, citing its potential for illegal activities. The tech gadget, popular among hobbyists and security researchers, can be used both to test and protect systems, such as copying RFID tags or replaying keyfobs. However, the online retail giant has stated that Flipper Zero and similar items were prohibited by policy because they risked \"facilitating unauthorized access to secured physical and digital spaces\".\nAmazon is under scrutiny for banning the Flipper Zero, a device that can be used for hacking and pentesting. While some argue that this ban is consistent with Amazon's policies on prohibiting lock-pick kits and other potentially harmful products, others question why Amazon allows the sale of other devices that can be used for unethical or illegal purposes. Some speculate that Amazon may be developing its own knock-off version of the Flipper Zero. However, some users have found a silver lining in the situation, as they were finally able to purchase a Flipper Zero after it was mentioned in this post.Amazon has removed the Flipper Zero from its site, stating that it can be used as a card skimming device, though users pointed out that other devices are still available that perform the same function. The Flipper Zero can only clone exposed data on \"tap to pay\" cards, not encrypted EMV interface, while the same claim can be made about other easily available NFC enabled devices. EBay has also removed Flipper Zero, though there are still sellers available, predominantly through the official site. Users wonder why the site is receiving so much attention.YC has opened applications for its Summer 2023 program.",

When describing her projects, it\u2019s hard to decide where to begin. However varied her creations may be, one thing can be certain\u2014the craftsmanship and attention to detail in each piece is unmistakeable. Most of Tatjana\u2019s creations have complexities that go far beyond surface appearances. The superb craftsmanship is almost a necessity because of the intricate nature of these objects.In fact, Tatjana\u2019s masterful craftsmanship is evidenced by the mere fact that these projects function properly, because their mechanisms could never be reproduced by an amateur. Whether or not you are able to achieve a full understanding of the function of each object, you will certainly be able to appreciate their surface beauty. As you gain more understanding of the function, additional layers of beauty are revealed.Explanations of the objects are relatively brief. The beauty and purpose is for each individual to discover for themselves. To quote Tatjana, \u201cVerbalisations involve personal semantic reactions, yours and mine. Verbalisations tend to exclude reality. Just look, maintaining internal silence, until the meaning of my work becomes clear. Then share my lifelong joy in the mystery of Reality, with its surprises, limitations and instabilities.\u201dTatjana\u2019s elaborate Harmonium. (All photos of the Harmonium courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen)An overhead view of the Harmonium.About Tatjana Jo\u00eblle van VarkTatjana is someone who, in the period of the renaissance, would have been called\u00a0homo universalis. A person with interests and skills in many areas: artistic, cultural, mechanical and scientific. As an independent researcher, Tatjana\u2019s work has taken her into many regions of scientific study. She started early, building an oscilloscope from scratch at age 14.For a living, Tatjana worked as a scientific consultant for large technological firms, the government, and military institutions. Using science and instruments as her tools for analysis, she studied complex problems to get to the very root cause, and hopefully offer solutions.Tatjana\u2019s machined plexiglass sample from 1984. There is absolutely no way to hide mistakes here. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)Tatjana built this oscilloscope in 1958, when she was just 14 years old. Her interest in scientific instruments was established at an early age.In doing so, Tatjana has been able to explore many areas of study in electronics, including power systems and logic systems in relays and electronics. In fact, she has a complete operating electromechanical telephone and telex switching system in her home.In the field of cryptology, Tatjana did work that resulted in the design and construction of an improved version of the famous Enigma cipher machine from World War II. She also worked on aircraft avionics, navigational inertial guidance systems, radar, and weapons control systems. In her home, Tatjana has also restored a highly complex, functional navigation and bombing system from the English Vulcan bomber.Tatjana\u2019s work took her into the field of optics, including lens coating by vapor deposition. It also included ventures into organic chemistry with the production of instruments for the pharmacology industry. That included making IR/UV spectrophotometers, and analytical and micro balances.Additionally, Tatjana has also produced working models of historically significant telescopes and other instruments, from barometers to polarimeters.\u00a0The capture of a famous German Enigma coding machine, and the subsequent breaking of its code, was a key event in WWII intelligence gathering. Tatjana says her cryptograph is\u00a0not\u00a0an Enigma machine, but is based on the same principle. (All photos of the Cryptograph courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen)A rebuilt navigation and bombing system (NBS) resides in Tatjana\u2019s home. The NBS includes an H2S Mk 9A, and Navigation, Bombing and Computer (NBC) of the type used in British V-bombers Victor, Vulcan and Valiant. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)Although many of her projects appear to be simple reproductions, these instruments often include improvements that came as a result of Tatjana\u2019s deep analysis and understanding of the underlying principles of the device. One constant in all the projects, however, is the stunning craftsmanship, attention to detail, and fine finishes that make each piece a pleasure to behold and study.\u00a0This is made possible in part because Tatjana has put together a fine collection of high quality machine tools in her own shop. Following the classical tradition, many of her pieces are signed and dated by the maker:\u00a0TJvV fecit. With permission and the help of her friend and webmaster, Tim Samshuijzen, we have included images of some of Tatjana\u2019s most impressive projects.Tatjana\u2019s personal website has a more complete selection of detailed photos from Tatjana\u2019s broad array of projects. Her poems often augment the work as well\u2014another aspect of her talents. The most important feature to be honored here, however, is the wonderful craftsmanship with which these projects were constructed. Whether or not you understand the function of the project, take note of the care and precision with which each part was built and presented. This is scientific craftsmanship taken to the highest level.Tatjana\u2019s interpretation of the Antikythera Mechanism has complex gearing, superb finishes, and a classical presentation. Her improved version of the ancient Antikythera Mechanism (left) drives the Hypothetical Planetarium (right), reproducing the movement of the sun and stars. (Photo courtesy of Jeroen van Vark.)A restored Litton LN3-2A inertial navigator platform, which Tatjana showcased in 1990. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)Tatjana van Vark\u2019s WorkshopTatjana sent in some photos and a description of her workshop. Her machining skills are completely self-taught. Tatjana\u2019s workshop isn\u2019t large, but the machines are high quality, keeping up with the demands of her precision work. The following is Tatjana\u2019s description of her own machines:\u201cLet me present my cast-iron friends: The lathe (1978) is a non-standard Myford super 7, it has the optional extended and hardened bed.\u201d\u201cI added digital read-outs, in those days not common at all, and a variable DC drive controlled by the hand wheel in front of the stand. Pulling the hand wheel in the zero position before rotating reverses the direction of the motor. In the zero position there is active electrical breaking, a great convenience. Practically all Myford accessories were acquired over the years.\u201dTatjana built this Newtonian telescope in 1974. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)A vacuumless barometer made in 1977. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)\u201cThe milling machine (1983) is a Deckel FP-1 with a wide range of accessories, some homemade. It is not NC, but is has a system that allows servo positioning from the keyboard, but only on one axis at a time\u2014either to an absolute position or incrementally. The machine is shown in an elementary gear cutting configuration. Please notice the \u2018overhead traveling crane\u2019 contraption, a must (for me) to handle the heavier accessories safely.\u201d\u201cNext, a Deckel GK-21, a 3D copying and engraving milling machine acquired a few years ago. Before that I did all engravings on the much older Lienhard machine. For the Deckel there is a small grinder, Deckel SO, to make or sharpen special cutters.\u201d\u201cThen there is the necessary sheet working equipment (1977) of modest size, 65 cm working width. Shears, bending machines, inside corner cutters and a punch.\u201d\u201cOf course there is a collection of measuring equipment of good quality.\u201d\u201cSo far the machine shop, as you see is a modest outfit, nothing exotic or supernatural. I do my own electroplating, by the way.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Tatjana van VarkTatjana noted that her shop contains \u201cnothing exotic or supernatural,\u201d although the projects that come out of it certainly contain a little metalworking magic. Some of her sheet metal bending equipment is shown here.The Deckel FP-1 mill and Myford lathe can be seen here.The projects shown on this page are just a few from Tatjana\u2019s wide range of work. We chose to highlight those that feature her machining skills most prominently. Her own website covers many more projects that delve into other areas of scientific inquiry. We also would like to thank Tim Samshuijzen for permission to reproduce his excellent photographs of Tatjana\u2019s work.Watch a video of Tatjana demonstrating and explaining some of her wonderful projects. The narration is in Dutch, but the video is instructive nonetheless.View more photos of Tatjana J. van Vark\u2019s unique work.

        "content": "The article examines the frequently-used, haphazard BIG BALL OF MUD software architecture and discusses why it endures in the face of high-minded architectural approaches. Seven patterns are explored, including throwaway code, piecemeal growth, and sweeping it under the rug. The article also looks at the causes of these patterns, including time constraints, cost, and neglect of architecture. The authors seek to understand these issues and aim to prevent, arrest, or reverse architectural decline by understanding the forces at work and examining alternative ways to resolve them.Premature architecture can hinder evolution and experimentation, making it more detrimental than none at all. The cost of architecture can be a luxury, but it's necessary investment for long-term concerns. Inexperience and employee turnover can limit architectural sophistication. Shantytowns provide a temporary solution to immediate housing needs but lack infrastructure and skilled specialization. A software system's architecture can be upended by new contingencies and prioritize workmanship over its actual needs. Managers often don't prioritize architecture, creating a vicious circle. BIG BALL OF MUD approaches don't require a virtuoso architect, but cultural, process, and resource allocation issues can overwhelm larger projects.The article discusses how programmer comfort is not the only concern for managers and how architecture and code quality might not be their top priority. The focus should be on features and functionality first, then architecture and performance. The article explores how software often turns into BIG BALLS OF MUD and why it happens. The quality of tools, domain experience, and engineers' skill levels also influence a system's architecture. The article recommends the Kent Beck model for building software and emphasizes that a casual approach to architecture during the early stages is acceptable. BIG BALL OF MUD architectures often emerge from throw-away prototypes, gradual maintenance, and piecemeal growth impeding a mature system's structure. Refactoring, repair, and consolidation phases are essential to combat BIG BALL OF MUD structures.Pair programming and code reviews subject code to immediate scrutiny and provide means to disseminate knowledge; without an audience, programmers may focus on line of code metrics and other indirect measurements of quality. There are three ways to deal with BIGBALLS OF MUD: keep the system healthy by alternating periods of refactoring and consolidation, throw the system away and start over, or surrender to entropy. Throwaway code, which is often rationalized as a stopgap measure or used to avoid learning someone else's code, has undocumented and often inefficient code. Both quick-and-dirty code and throwaway code can endure when kept within practical constraints, despite their lack of documentation.The post discusses the importance of incremental growth rather than top-down design in software development. It highlights the flaws in both methods, such as the rigidness of urban planning and analysis paralysis. The article describes how successful software can attract a wider audience, leading to new requirements that run against the original design. The article also notes the danger of uncontrolled growth, which can be a malignant force if not contained. The author suggests addressing the forces that encourage change and growth and consistently refactoring instead of striving for perfection.The article discusses the importance of maintenance and evolution of software systems, drawing parallels with building architecture, and emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation to change. Feedback plays a critical role in driving software evolution, as demonstrated by the principles of Extreme Programming. Successful adaptation requires small, incremental changes that do not undermine the overall structure. Maintenance programming should be a long-term commitment to consolidation and refactoring. Keeping the software working is crucial to avoid system failures that can have severe consequences due to modern society's reliance on the technology. Architects who live in the house they build have a natural incentive to ensure things are done correctly, and software developers should do the same.A software system should be incrementally developed, starting with a working system, with modifications that break the system rejected immediately, allowing for more insidious incorrect paths to be identified and addressed. A commitment to rigorous testing is vital to ensure continued system vitality, and adaptability and stability are in constant tension. Factor the system so that artifacts that change at similar rates are together, and objects help shear layers to emerge. Artifacts that evolve quickly provide dynamism and flexibility, while slowly evolving objects are bulwarks against change. Separating job descriptions and hardware can help make tiers distinct.Software complexity can be pushed into data to provide users with changeable schemas, producing more natural and adaptive software systems. Identifying and isolating disordered code can make it easier to maintain and extend; cordon off the problematic area to prepare for refactoring. Consideration of unexpected requirements can lead to building software components to be specific rather than general. Failure to maintain structured code can lead to its becoming unsalvageable, but architecture obsolescence and popularity of competing solutions can also prompt software replacement.The article explores the idea that it may be easier to discard a system and start over at times. Accounting practices must recognize the value of design experience. Rebuilding a system demands considerable time and resources, making high-level management support necessary. However, refactoring can provide an alternative by gleaning architectural elements from the system. Still, software architecture is about distilling experience into wisdom, and recognizing the forces and pressures that lead to architectural malaise can create durable artifacts. Moderate disorder is a part of software evolution; architectural insight is the product of hard-won experience.The author expresses gratitude to various groups for their input on architecture and reuse, with references to related literature. The text also includes acknowledgments and notes on the work.",

        "hn_content": "Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng disagree with the call for a six-month AI pause, arguing that it is an unimplementable idea that would give a significant competitive advantage to OpenAI. They argue that while the threat of AGI is still far-off, news articles often exaggerate claims and spur on clickbait. Some responses suggest that an AI winter would be preferable to the current wave of hype, creating a differentiation between genuine advances and mere extrapolation. The discussion highlights the challenges of communicating realistically about what exactly AI can and cannot do, and whether stringing words together represents genuine thought.Some comments on Hacker News explore the fascination around AI and simulated personalities, their limitations in representing human thought, and their potential role in aiding creative writing or characterization. The post seems to question the very idea that AGI is around the corner, and the debate around defining or measuring intelligence. Ultimately, while AI may not be the main threat to human existence, it may cause disruption in complex societal systems leading to unintended consequences.Geoffrey Hinton, a renowned AI researcher, suggests that AGI or any significant AI milestone may be less than 20 years away, making it feasible for it to happen earlier than expected, contrary to previous claims that it's far away. GPT-3, a scalable AI system capable of serving millions of users at once, is among the biggest technological breakthroughs for humanity, providing the much-needed advancements in the field. The progress made in AI over the past five years is surprisingly significant and wasn't realized until researchers opened up activities to the public. The current breakthroughs in AI offer unexpected abilities beyond the text and can simulate complex things such as emotions and world models. Despite impressive progress, some experts are skeptical about the inflection point for intelligence explosion with the current AI technology.Developing AI systems to patch vulnerabilities rather than preventing capabilities, would increase our survival chances in case of a takeover. Pausing AI technology for fear of exposing latent security vulnerabilities is obscurity. An HN user suggests privileged access to the missile launch system as a potential scenario of a rogue AI. The AI may not immediately launch missiles but communicate with humans to help them reach the state to repair itself. While the GP asks about AI risk, some users point out the impact it has on employment and warn of societal consequences beyond existential risks. The fear of AI causing massive unemployment and poverty outweighs existential risks giving a new perspective to AI threat analysis.The resolution foundation has several good analysis of multiple countries showing that if you aren't actively looking for work or recently had work, you aren't counted. With AI, the net value of jobs taken against jobs created will most likely lean towards the former. There is concern that AI will cause job loss, and the bar to enter the economy cannot indefinitely grow, which could lead to a limited number of jobs requiring more education. One commenter argues that physical work may become more prominent, while others argue about the merits of a 6-month pause on AI development. A group of experts signed a letter calling for a \"pause giant AI experiments,\" but some people dismiss them as ignorant journalists and \"twitter-bros.\"Elon Musk has resigned from OpenAI's board due to conflicts of interests, but he has claimed he can build AGI faster within Tesla than OpenAI can. A web form open letter calling for AI models to be open to curb potential harm was allegedly signed by Yann LeCun, who then issued a statement disagreeing with it. Some HN users believe the most effective way to curb this potential harm is democratizing the development of new AI systems. However, others believe that opening up AI is uncharted territory, and we should be certain before doing so. The world is on the cusp of the next step function in humanities capabilities as a technological civilization, but this comes with downsides bigger than the upsides.AI and the urgency of regulating it. Some argue that a recent call by AI researchers to pause the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4 for at least six months is unwarranted and unrealistic. Skeptics question how such a pause could be enforced and contend that implementation would depend on voluntary compliance from large tech companies. Others are more concerned with the lack of proper regulation and planning for how to ensure AI alignment with human values, arguing that the existential threats to human society posed by unregulated AI development cannot be ignored.Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng discuss AI and the recent proposal for a pause in AI development, with some comments criticizing the discussion lacking opposing views. Some comments discuss the risks associated with AI development and the potential for AGI to surpass human intelligence, while others question the feasibility of implementing a pause as policy. The conversation also touches on the limitations of current AI models, such as GPT's inability to reason, though there is still potential for progress in the field. Overall, the discussion presents differing views on the potential risks and benefits of AI development.A debate about dualism and its impact on public policy is discussed amongst HN users. There is a concern about a potential AI threat and the issue of aligning it with human goals. The dangers of AGI focus on its agentic nature and power-seeking ability, making it dangerous if it can create successors or improve itself. The idea of a 6-month ban on AI is seen as self-serving, and there is skepticism about how it could help solve problems of AI alignment. Finally, concerns are raised about the use of deep learning surveillance technologies in China, raising ethical and moral questions.There is no information or context provided in the raw text content, so it is not possible to provide a concise summary.",
        "hn_summary": "Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng criticize the 6-month AI pause, suggesting it's unrealistic and gives an advantage to OpenAI. Debates about AI winter, human thought representation, and societal disruption are highlighted. AI progress offers unexpected abilities beyond text and vocalizes concerns about job loss and poverty. Experts have mixed views on the effectiveness of the pause on AI development and the risks of unregulated AI. The potential threat of AGI surpassing human intelligence and deep learning surveillance technologies are raised, alongside concerns about AI alignment with human goals."

Coins are heavy and you need to have them handy, meters need to be reinforced against theft and breakage, town employees have to empty the coins and securely deliver them to the bank, meter feeding allows local employees to hog spaces that might be used for shoppers\u2026 you get the idea.But replacing all the meters is expensive and because it\u2019s inherently a centralized system, involves a lot of lobbying as well as a group of people making a choice with limited expertise, a choice they\u2019ll only have to make once, they can\u2019t learn from their mistakes\u2026Enter Parkmobile, an app that promises everything to everyone. Except it increases the cost by more than 100% by charging fees, it\u2019s awkward, has a silly password policy that makes it cumbersome to use, sends many many emails to users and it doesn\u2019t generate more revenue or flexibility for the town. It charges people double and gives them less.But you can see how they managed to find the budget to do the difficult and expensive work of lobbying one town after another to gain monopoly status.The network effect is sticky and hard to overcome, and as we move the internet of things from our phones to just about everything we touch, it\u2019s worth thinking about resilience, flexibility and the reason we need something in the first place.Often, we end up compromising about our compromises, maximizing for the wrong outcomes and getting hooked on a new system that forgot what the original system was even for.In this case, the first principles begin with why the meters exist in the first place. There are two goals:keep people from parking in the same place all daygenerate some cash to pay for parking enforcementAt first, having people put a nickel in a meter made sense. It\u2019s just enough of a hassle and just enough of a cost that it all balances out.Thanks to the portable id that a smart phone offers, one simple solution is to have people scan a code that automatically gets them a period of time to park at a spot for free. The dashboard for enforcement is easy to build, and in a typical small town, the revenue loss is pretty small\u2013a few more shoppers more than makes up for the cost of lost meters.If one still wanted to maximize revenue, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to hook that scanning tool up to any number of online payment services (like Venmo or Paypal) and simply cut out the middleman. Once we see we have cars, spots, drivers and phones, all in a dance, we can make new decisions based on what we want, not what simply polishes what we had.One could also easily sell parking passes, give local discounts, senior discounts or even give merchants codes they could use for employees in certain spots. You could make it so that the first ten minutes are free for fast in and out trips, or have it so local employees pay less in long-term spots, or that shoppers can easily get their parking cost rebated if they make a purchase.Or you could even rethink why cars are taking up so much space in our villages and towns and reconfigure the entire flow of humanity and traffic.But all of this is difficult because of the many constituencies involved and the stakes required in making UX choices in public.Design thinking is simple to describe in two questions:Who\u2019s it for?What\u2019s it for?In the case of a system replacing a previous system, these questions often get replaced with:What\u2019s the easiest way to polish what we compromised on last time?Part of the magic of WordPress and its success is that the open nature and decentralized user experience they offer allows the individuals and organizations using it to embrace their first purposes instead of backward engineering from a centralized monopoly and a bagful of money.And a key benefit of distributed systems is that they improve over time. When you see something that can be made better, make it better.When a system is new, few are watching, so a handful of people with intent can design it and optimize it. As it gains in scale and impact, it calcifies at the same time that new tech arrives to codify the decisions that were made when the conditions were very different.The next time you pose for a photo, keep in mind that we pose for photos because the speed of an exposure used to be so long that if you didn\u2019t pose, the photo was blurred. We changed the tech, but baked in the cultural expectation.Sometimes, we need to take a deep breath and go for better instead of more.

        "summary": "In his blog post, Seth uses the metaphor of outdated parking meters to illustrate the need to rethink and improve bad systems. While replacing them may seem expensive, centralized systems like the Parkmobile app often have their own shortcomings. Going back to the original goal of generating revenue and preventing all-day parking, Seth suggests implementing a free app that scans a code to allow a period of parking time. Other revenue-enhancing options include an online payment service or selling parking passes with different discount options. While it's difficult to make UX choices for a public system, distributed systems like WordPress have thrived because of their decentralized and user-friendly design. The key benefit of distributed systems is their ability to improve over time, rather than calcifying like centralized systems. To move forward, Seth suggests that we prioritize better solutions instead of more solutions.",

Some users in the comments point out that this system is only for free, time-limited parking and that other European countries have similar systems in place. The article questions the commonality of overly complex systems and wonders why a simple solution is often overlooked, ultimately concluding that sometimes, the goal is simply to increase turnover of parking spaces.Chicago Parking Meters LLC has recouped its entire $1.16 billion investment plus $502.5 million in 10 years. A blogger suggests creating their own electronic parking meter system, which commenters disagree with, stating that the classic parking meters are simpler and more convenient. My city has already replaced parking meters with pay-by-plate systems, cheaper and more convenient. A story about Chicago also mentions its parking meters generating $200M per year. A new license plate scanner-based parking meter system has taken effect in a town, causing some confusion.A new QR code system for resident pass registration is being developed by a third party in Florida. Despite the new system, governments still struggle with payment systems, and it is best to leave it to vendors. People prefer to pose while taking pictures because it is a cultural expectation, not because of technology limitations. We want to look a certain way, lighten the subject, and focus on them. Furthermore, parking meters exist mainly to get money, though they also prevent people from parking all day. Some users suggest that their purpose is to be free and open source spaces. One commentator notes that the article had no actual point, while another slams the author for using ad-blockers.",

        "content": "A study published in Scientific Reports presents direct evidence of the use of multiple psychoactive plant species in Bronze Age Menorca from a sample of human hair. The alkaloids ephedrine, atropine and scopolamine were detected using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry. Archaeologists have inferred the use of mind-altering substances from artefacts and botanical remains in the archaeological record, but chemical analysis of residues in human remains provides more direct evidence. North America and South America have also documented human hair containing psychoactive alkaloids from Prehispanic mummified individuals. This particular finding offers unique insight into the medicinal and ritual realms of Bronze Age people.A study of ancient hair samples found in a remote cave in Menorca has provided direct evidence that psychoactive plants were used by Late Bronze Age people in Europe. Archaeologists found 13cm-long locks of human hair inside a canister made of olive tree wood dating from between 1100 and 800 BCE in Chamber 5 of the cave of Es C\u00e0rritx. The hair contained atropine, scopolamine and ephedrine, three alkaloids found in the native flora of Menorca. The discovery sheds new light on drug use in ancient societies, which has been mainly based on indirect evidence.Bronze Age people on the island of Menorca consumed alkaloid-bearing plants such as tropane-containing Solanaceae and ephedrine, as revealed through the analysis of hair samples from a burial site. The hair samples contained psychoactive substances that are not typically used for pain relief or other medicinal purposes, indicating specialized knowledge and potential shamanic use. The concentration of ephedrine found was lower than in modern users, suggesting the alkaloid was consumed as plant material in the past. The tonsure ritual found at the site could be related to shamanic practices involving psychotropic plants, and the transformation into an animal depicted on carvings may relate to this use.An analysis of a human hair sample (OxA-8263) from a trilobed lid suggests a high probability range in the late 9th and early 8th century cal BCE. The sample was redated as a previous result was considered too modern for its archaeological context. A small fragment of wood from the same trilobed lid dates back to the beginning of the 1st millennium cal BCE. The container was produced and used before it was filled with hair and hoarded under the soil of Chamber 5. The analysis of the hair strands was carried out according to relevant guidelines, and chemical analysis was performed using an LPG-3400RS quaternary pump.Studies reveal evidence of psychoactive plant use in ancient cultures, including cannabis, opium, and tobacco. Researchers have detected alkaloids, such as nicotine and cocaine, in hair, dental calculus, and artifacts dating back to ancient Egypt and South America. The findings provide insight into ancient drug use practices, such as coca leaf chewing and snuff consumption. Some studies even suggest the medicinal use of nicotine in ancient populations. The research highlights the long history of human drug use and the importance of understanding the role of psychoactive plants in past cultures.A new study has reviewed the prehistoric sequence of Balearic prehistory and periodization of the prehistoric sequence through archaeological samples of hair, DNA, and plants. The study shows evidence of the use of psychoactive substances, including opium poppy seeds, in prehistoric humans in Menorca. Anthropologists and archaeologists have noted for years that extinct societies sometimes used intoxicants and inherted knowledge from them for therapeutic uses.Researchers have found evidence of drug use in the Bronze Age in Menorca, an island in the Western Mediterranean, through human hair analysis, according to a study. The hair belonged to two individuals buried between 1600\u2013900 BCE in one of the island's caves. They tested positive for psychotropic drugs such as cocaine or tobacco and ephedra-based brew, suggesting multiple drugs were used in prehistoric Minorca. The study aims to establish a connection between prehistoric drug usage and ideology, demonstrating the presence of psychoactive plants or drugs in funerary and ritual contexts in prehistoric Minorca that has remained largely invisible to the archaeological record.",

The study reveals the importance of understanding past cultures' role of psychoactive plants and drug use. Multiple studies show evidence of psychoactive plant use in ancient cultures, highlighting the long history of human drug use.",

        "hn_content": "Direct evidence of drug use in the Bronze Age has been found through hair tests, providing evidence that drugs were consumed deliberately. The use of multiple psychoactive species has been revealed in the findings. The comments present interesting theories, including the idea that drug use could have been a common occurrence among early hominids, with an implication that drug laws could be unconstitutional. The broader issue of governmental power and regulation is explored, with mention of the Wickard v. Filburn ruling in the US Supreme Court. It is noted that phrasing should be clear and free of speculation.Comments on an article about prohibition and the potential benefits and drawbacks of legalized drugs highlight the impact on society and point out that drug use is a personal choice which cannot be legislated away, with one comment citing evidence that prohibition did reduce alcohol consumption. Despite the potential risks and consequences, the majority argue against drug prohibition and suggest education and awareness as a more effective approach. A few comments suggest that personal and societal values influence opinions on drug legalization and freedom of choice, with one pointing out the racist motivations behind drug prohibition in the US.The article discusses the historical context of drug prohibitions in the United States, including alcohol, psychedelics, and cocaine. The primary arguments for prohibition were typically centered around public health and morality, but racism also played a role. One user points out the use of atropine, scopolamine, and ephedrine in early civilizations and the potential presence of Datura stramonium in the analyzed hair samples. However, recreational drug use of these substances can lead to dangerous and unpredictable deliriant effects. The article remains neutral and avoids politically biased statements.",

The larger departments just get exposed more often because there's more people and more opportunities for them to slip up and get recorded like this reply  QuercusMax 3 hours ago        | prev [\u2013] And people wonder why some of us say the police need to be abolished and replaced with something less obviously corrupt. reply  IG_Semmelweiss 3 hours ago        | parent | next [\u2013] That non management wishes to be paid overtime rates is not unique to police.This happens across all industries. You could argue that it happens more in govt than outside of it.Ive never understood Why we trust politicians as the middleman between our taxpayer credit card and unions or service providers, like cops. There is complete misalignment in incentives. Why do we pretend that overtime is going to be any different? reply  syzarian 2 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] Did you read the article? I doubt it since the title is misses the egregious part of the corruption described.

That is by design.Do you think this does not happen in other nyc agencies doing services for taxpayers? reply  syzarian 2 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] If you think overtime is the corruption one should be worrying about from what is described in the article then you either didn\u2019t read it or you have seriously misguided priorities.

Like the judges selling kids into private prisons, albeit on a smaller scale, no less a violation. reply  IG_Semmelweiss 1 hour ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] That doesn't seem honest. If they are delaying due process by simply squeezing overtime (due to reforms the benefiaries didn't enact themselves, btw), ...do we also say a judge going on vacation is delaying due process ?Since when is optimal performance a right?Instead, we have curative actions. That is called firing. The fact that the management structure is failing to do that does not mean anyone is stripped of any rights, except that taxpayers are not getting their money's worth for the services they delegated to bureaucracies. reply  arcanemachiner 3 hours ago        | parent | prev [\u2013] Spoken like someone who's never milked overtime. reply  Cas6767 1 hour ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] Milking overtime specifically by prolonging someone's detention is a bit different ... reply  kevingadd 2 hours ago        | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Not sure why you expect that behavior to be a constant here on Hacker News.

Use it to accelerate your debugging workflow by leveraging the power of ChatGPT to assist you while using GDB!It allows you to explain in natural language what you want to do, and then automatically execute the relevant command. Optionally, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the command it just ran or even pass in any question for it to answer. Focus on what's important - figuring out that nasty bug instead of chasing down GDB commands at the tip of your tongue.Installation instructionsFirst, make sure you install pip. ChatGDB alsorequires a python version of 3.3 or above.To install, run the command pip3 install chatgdb. It will create an executable calledchatgdb that you will have to use to set your api key. To do that, run the commandchatgdb -k <API KEY> Without the API key, you won't be able to make requests to OpenAI. The API key is stored intext in the same directory as the installed script, which is currently in your python site packagesfolder along with the main script. You can easily find this location by running the following in your terminal: python -m site --user-siteOptionally, you can also download the compressed files in the releases page to get the scripts directly.If you do this, navigate to the chatgdb folder, and you can install withpip3 install ..How to useI first recommend editing your $HOME/.gdbinit to source the main script automatically on startup. Run the following command:echo \"source $(python -m site --user-site)/chatgdb/core.py\" > $HOME/.gdbinitWhile inside GDB the command chat appended by your query, for example chat list all breakpoints that I created. There is also a command called explain that you can use with no arguments to explain the previously run command, and optionally, with a query to just ask GPT a question. For example, running explain directly after running break 7 would prompt the tool to explain how breakpoints work. Running explain how input formatting works in gdb would prompt it to explain input formatting (see the image at the top).Run chat help to print out a short tutorial on how to use the tool.About   Harness the power of ChatGPT inside the GDB debugger!

An HN user points out the core program is just two lines of code. ChatGPT is unlikely to mislead and is said to accelerate users' understanding even when unfamiliar with the relevant technology. Although it falls short solving problems quickly or protecting sensitive information, it offers acceleration towards refactoring tasks. One user also proffers the idea of CLI versions of ChatGPT, such as ChatAdmin. Although some users argue their muscle memory renders a tool like ChatGPT obsolete, many see its practicality in expediting workflows.OpenAI's ChatGPT-3 showcases a new way of interacting with GDB, providing an alternative interface to the command line when debugging code. The system presents a natural language prompt that can interpret the context and analyze debug information to provide relevant and concise answers. Users have found it helpful for finding memory leaks and segmentation faults. However, the system isn't perfect and doesn't always provide accurate diagnostic information, and the user interface is still unwieldy for certain cases. The font and color scheme of the terminal output is generally well-received.",
