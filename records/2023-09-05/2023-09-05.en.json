    "originBody": "HOME WHY INSTALL MORE INFO VSCodium Free/Libre Open Source Software Binaries of VS Code VSCodium is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoft’s editor VS Code. Why Does This Exist Microsoft’s vscode source code is open source (MIT-licensed), but the product available for download (Visual Studio Code) is licensed under this not-FLOSS license and contains telemetry/tracking. According to this comment from a Visual Studio Code maintainer: When we [Microsoft] build Visual Studio Code, we do exactly this. We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license. When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a “clean” build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license The VSCodium project exists so that you don’t have to download+build from source. This project includes special build scripts that clone Microsoft’s vscode repo, run the build commands, and upload the resulting binaries for you to GitHub releases. These binaries are licensed under the MIT license. Telemetry is disabled. If you want to build from source yourself, head over to Microsoft’s vscode repo and follow their instructions. VSCodium exists to make it easier to get the latest version of MIT-licensed VS Code. Download latest release Available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux Use a Package Manager (providing VSCodium in their repository) The following package managers use their own repository, in case of any installation issues report to their related repository. Install with Brew (Mac) If you are on a Mac and have Homebrew installed: brew install --cask vscodium Note for Mac OS X Mojave users: if you see “App can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software” when opening VSCodium the first time, you can right-click the application and choose Open. This should only be required the first time opening on Mojave. Install with Windows Package Manager (WinGet) If you use Windows and have Windows Package Manager installed: winget install vscodium Install with Chocolatey (Windows) If you use Windows and have Chocolatey installed (thanks to @Thilas): choco install vscodium Install with Scoop (Windows) If you use Windows and have Scoop installed: scoop bucket add extras scoop install vscodium Install with snap (Linux) VSCodium is available in the Snap Store as Codium, currently maintained by the VSCodium project. If your GNU/Linux distribution has support for snaps: snap install codium --classic Install on Parrot OS: VSCodium is pre-installed in Parrot OS. In case you don’t find it by default, you can retrieve it from the official Parrot repo sudo apt update && sudo apt install codium Install on Nix(OS) VSCodium is available in Nixpkgs. You can install it by adding vscodium to environment.systemPackages in configuration.nix, or locally: nix-env -iA nixpkgs.vscodium Install on Arch Linux VSCodium is available on the AUR (Arch User Repository), and can be installed with an AUR Helper. Examples: Aura: sudo aura -A vscodium-bin Yay: yay -S vscodium-bin Use a Package Manager (deb/rpm, provided by VSCodium related repository) @paulcarroty has set up a repository for VSCodium. The instructions below are adapted from there with CDN mirror. Any issues installing VSCodium using your package manager should be directed to that repository’s issue tracker. Install on Debian / Ubuntu (deb package): Add the GPG key of the repository: wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg \\gpg --dearmor \\sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg Add the repository: echo 'deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg ] https://download.vscodium.com/debs vscodium main' \\sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list Update then install vscodium (if you want vscodium-insiders, then replace codium by codium-insiders): sudo apt update && sudo apt install codium Install on Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / RockyLinux / OpenSUSE (rpm package): Add the GPG key of the repository: sudo rpmkeys --import https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/-/raw/master/pub.gpg Add the repository: Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/Rocky Linux: printf \"[gitlab.com_paulcarroty_vscodium_repo]\\nname=download.vscodium.com\\nbaseurl=https://download.vscodium.com/rpms/\\nenabled=1\\ngpgcheck=1\\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\\ngpgkey=https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/-/raw/master/pub.gpg\\nmetadata_expire=1h\"sudo tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/vscodium.repo OpenSUSE/SUSE: printf \"[gitlab.com_paulcarroty_vscodium_repo]\\nname=gitlab.com_paulcarroty_vscodium_repo\\nbaseurl=https://download.vscodium.com/rpms/\\nenabled=1\\ngpgcheck=1\\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\\ngpgkey=https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/-/raw/master/pub.gpg\\nmetadata_expire=1h\"sudo tee -a /etc/zypp/repos.d/vscodium.repo Install the software: (if you want vscodium-insiders, then replace codium by codium-insiders) Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/Rocky Linux: sudo dnf install codium OpenSUSE/SUSE: sudo zypper in codium Install on Gentoo / Funtoo Linux (ebuild): Funtoo: sudo emerge -av vscodium-bin Gentoo: sudo emerge -av vscodium Flatpak Option (Linux) VSCodium is (unofficially) available as a Flatpak app and here’s the build repo. If your distribution has support for flatpak, and you have enabled the flathub repo, you can install VSCodium via the command line: flatpak install flathub com.vscodium.codium …or by opening the flatpakref file from Flathub. VSCodium can also be found in GNOME Software if you have gnome-software-plugin-flatpak installed (as recommended in the Flathub setup instructions).

Would someone contribute here some resources on how this is avoided in such projects? Or maybe my concerns are valid :) reply danpalmer 16 hours agoparentYour concerns are absolutely valid. Without casting any judgement on this project, the process of taking, modifying, and redistributing is hard to do in a trustworthy way. Big companies go to extreme lengths to ensure a chain of trust of the software they build, and app distribution platforms[^1] go to extreme lengths to ensure a full chain of trust end-to-end[^2] from developer to apps running on users devices.There&#x27;s basically no way to do this without trusting the redistributor in addition to the original publisher, but some things can reduce the amount of trust. Having a verifiable build process, that checks signing keys and hashes, that re-signs, etc, that all helps. If end-users can theoretically produce exactly the same build themselves it&#x27;s easier to trust it.The best option however is for the source project to produce unbranded builds themselves, and potentially for a project like VSCodium to become \"config only\" for things like disabling telemetry, and therefore not requiring re-signing. The Chromium project distributes its own Chromium binaries which lack the Google-specific stuff for example.[^1]: Mostly thinking of app stores, but the same is basically true of things like Debian package repositories.[^2]: App stores typically re-sign in the middle, so you do have to trust the store, but see (1), these companies go to great lengths to ensure trustworthiness there. reply sqeaky 16 hours agorootparentTrusting \"big companies\" because we presume they have guard rails seems like a bad idea, it is how we got the solar winds supply chain attack.When I worked for one of the largest voting machine companies I was astounded how the final build process for the software was done just before it was sent to the customer. It was built on a Jenkins server that several people had access to change and update with minimal oversight and the devops person had freedom to do anything to with no oversight. For the year I worked there this one man could have changed dozens of elections if he chose to and figuring it out would have been very hard. I am sure a large enough investigation could could have figured out such a thing, but by then the damage would already be done. If he changed only municipal elections that couldn&#x27;t affors such an investigation it might never have been done. I have no reason to claim this happened, but we certainly can&#x27;t prove it didn&#x27;t and this is in one of the most paranoid and regulated spaces in software development. reply danpalmer 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m speaking from experience at Google, and honestly our software integrity processes are like nothing I could have imagined coming in. Not everything is perfect and it has clearly evolved over time, but basically for a modern internal Google codebase I don&#x27;t think I could have much more trust that it is what it claims to be.I don&#x27;t know if other big tech is quite the same, but from the little I&#x27;ve heard, I suspect that Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and others in that ilk are similar.I&#x27;m very much in the camp of \"trust but verify\" here. You&#x27;re right that Solar Winds was an utter disaster. It should never have been able to happen. reply dv_dt 15 hours agorootparentMicrosoft has had some serious recent faults in their fundamental handling of a couple of areas (like driver signing! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37261500). reply MaxBarraclough 14 hours agorootparentAnd that&#x27;s on top of Azure&#x27;s recent appearance in the news.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36979532 (Microsoft comes under blistering criticism for “grossly irresponsible” security) reply phillipcarter 12 hours agorootparentprevTrusting \"open source\" is also how we get tons of other kinds of vulnerabilities, but that doesn&#x27;t mean open source is unworthy of trust.The reason why organizations turn to other companies to deliver this is because there&#x27;s a \"throat to choke\" for when things go wrong and a financial incentive to fix the inevitable issues when they come up. reply gustavus 15 hours agorootparentprevYa I used to buy into that idea about using vendor products with the rationale that \"at very least they wouldn&#x27;t want to get sued for negligence so they have to have some basic security in place\" then that huge bug came out where you got root access in Azure if you simply didn&#x27;t send an AuthN header. reply justinhj 15 hours agorootparentWell let’s not forget the importance of being able to sue. You use free software without warranty there is nobody to sue. reply Capricorn2481 14 hours agorootparent\"Yeah but you can sue\" is not really that viable. How&#x27;s that going for anybody? Not everyone can dedicate their time and savings to gambling on getting compensated. At the very least, the open source community is vigilant and quick to ostracize bad actors. Big tech companies get tax breaks to screw us over reply yencabulator 14 hours agorootparentprevGood luck trying to sue Microsoft over a security vulnerability. reply mcny 12 hours agorootparentI think it is worth mentioning here that Microsoft does not care about user privacy.I don&#x27;t know if this is because Microsoft took down the blog posts and press releases or because Google web search sucks now (different conversation) but I had trouble finding the source for Microsoft statement. I&#x27;m talking about the incident when Microsoft spied into a user&#x27;s hotmail email contents.> However, to determine the identity of the leaker, CNET reveals, Microsoft actually looked through the Hotmail email of a French blogger who was in contact with the leaker, and make available online early copies of Windows 7 and Windows 8, as well as means that allowed users to circumvent activations protection for Microsoft and Windows.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bgr.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;microsoft-hotmail-and-outlook-privac...I wouldn&#x27;t give Microsoft any benefit of the doubt. While I have utmost respect for the people (who I know and) who work there, the senior leadership has always been poopy at best. I would never trust a word they say. reply MaxBarraclough 13 hours agorootparentprevYou can use a commercial (paid-for) Linux distro if you really want the legal protections of being a customer, while staying with Free and Open Source software.As Capricorn2481 points out though, suing isn&#x27;t really on the cards for most individual. reply fallat 16 hours agorootparentprev> There&#x27;s basically no way to do this without trusting the redistributor in addition to the original publisher, but some things can reduce the amount of trust. Having a verifiable build process, that checks signing keys and hashes, that re-signs, etc, that all helps. If end-users can theoretically produce exactly the same build themselves it&#x27;s easier to trust it.Really what much else could you ask for?It only takes 1 trusted friend to verify the codebase, and from there it can spread. Luckily there are a lot of talented people on the Internet whom several people can vouch for, easy to find. It&#x27;s pretty much a non-problem in the age of the Internet.The same natural logic applies to anything else really... like cars - \"yo what car do you trust?\"It&#x27;s just the nature of living. If you don&#x27;t have the skills, you need to find someone who does to trust. And no just because it comes from a company doesn&#x27;t mean you can trust it, that&#x27;s a fallacy. \"Safety\" doesn&#x27;t necessary equate to \"profits\" which is what a business needs to live. It&#x27;s an organism. reply danpalmer 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m certainly not equating safety to profits, but I think that a company such as Microsoft with decades of experience distributing cryptographically verified software to a range of demanding consumers (e.g. governments) and being big enough to be able to have teams running things like their certificate authority infrastructure, is much more likely to produce secure binary distributions than some GitHub Actions and shell scripts.I don&#x27;t think your car analogy quite fits, as there are ongoing updates, and it&#x27;s not like the end-user perception of regular VSCode, or backdoored VSCode, are going to be any different until someone spots the backdoor (and we can&#x27;t rely on that). reply yencabulator 14 hours agorootparentMeanwhile in the real world, Microsoft is actively screwing up, losing control of their signing keys, failing to implementing even basics of Azure authentication, destroying Azure customer VM security, and so on.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37261500https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28347141https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28532531 reply fallat 11 hours agorootparentprevSeems your assumptions about their practices are wrong based on the other comment, but let&#x27;s pretend that&#x27;s the truth.Why would a GitHub Action be worse? You&#x27;re just telling me it is, asking me to believe that...The car analogy is just that - you can break any analogy if you try. You&#x27;ve got a better one to help prove me right? :) reply Nullabillity 16 hours agorootparentprevThe best option would have been for the source project to not be distributing malware in the first place. reply wredue 14 hours agorootparentprev>big companies go to great lengths to ensure chain of trustlol. reply dataflow 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve never tried this, but in theory, if these projects produce builds on GitHub Actions and you trust Microsoft&#x27;s security, then you should be able to just look at the commit hash that got pulled in the action and diff that against upstream and just study that. If the diff looks safe [1] then I think that implies the binary can be trusted.[1] Of course this includes ensuring it doesn&#x27;t e.g. pull anything from the internet whose integrity you can&#x27;t similarly guarantee... reply krick 14 hours agorootparentSomebody please bother to explain why this is downvoted. The reasoning seems perfectly valid. Of course, there are a lot of ways how somebody could fuck up, but in theory automated builds on github have the same trustworthiness guarantees as Microsoft&#x27;s very own VSCode binaries. reply hedora 15 hours agoparentprevI just installed vscodium on my manjaro machine. It built from the AUR source.I’m sure you could diff the source code the package used, and the upstream Microsoft git SHA it is claims to be derived from:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aur.archlinux.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;vscodiumIncidentally, there is now an open source remote mode extension, so I have no reason to use the proprietary version. No more telemetry from me! reply ranguna 1 hour agorootparentThe open source remote extensions doesn&#x27;t support hardware keys as ssh keys. They have an issue open for this for years now.I use vscodium either way, you need to get used to stuff like this from time to time. reply yencabulator 14 hours agorootparentprev> there is now an open source remote mode extensionURL please? Open VSX lists several but it&#x27;s hard to evaluate if they&#x27;re complete & stable from just the READMEs. For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xaberus&#x2F;vscode-remote-oss has existed for a long time, but one would need to spend a few hours to know if it works well enough. reply unstuck3958 4 hours agorootparentprev> Incidentally, there is now an open source remote mode extensionGod bless the Arch User Repo. Stuff like this has made it impossible for me to move on from Arch. reply Xelbair 16 hours agoparentprevwith how the current tech world is, and after working in it, I&#x27;m the opposite.I have absolutely 0 trust towards any big corp doing things properly, and not cramming the applications full of spyware in the name of telemetry. and i would rather trust a bunch of insane dedicated people trying to make FOSS software. reply skybrian 15 hours agoparentprevYes, I also trust the original company more, for now. It would be nice to have more choices.Reproducible builds would help here, like Go did for their newest SDK [1].This would be particularly true for a fork when the source changes are fairly minimal, since you could just verify the patch.Linux distros are fairly similar; why do we mostly trust Debian packages? Because there’s an umbrella organization and a process. That’s less true of a standalone organization.Maybe eventually there will be an umbrella organization that just does reproducible builds, and people will use that to distribute binaries. (And independent verification could keep them honest, like happens with domain registrars.)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rebuild reply haolez 15 hours agorootparentGood point. That&#x27;s one problem that might be well solved by something like BitTorrent, which hashes all the files as part of the protocol. Once a binary gets analyzed and trusted (the current binary, not the process or every new upgrade), it can be safely used. reply brnt 13 hours agorootparentprevVscode packaging as&#x2F;is famously not public. Plus, trust to do what exactly? Come with telemetry flipped on? reply skybrian 9 hours agorootparentTrust is always relative to a threat model. I trust that the people who work on VS Code won&#x27;t do all sorts of nefarious things that hackers might want to do if they can get code running on your system. I trust that their telemetry settings do what they say they&#x27;ll do. And if someone finds a security bug, they&#x27;ll fix it.I don&#x27;t assume that there won&#x27;t be security holes, but in effect, I&#x27;m assuming they probably won&#x27;t affect me. reply 3np 13 hours agoparentprevExample Arch AUR but similar for Nix, Guix, Gentoo, others: On first install: - read AUR file - audit build & patching framework - audit patches On upgrade: - review patch changes - treat upstream changes like you would otherwise On upgrade with AUR file change: - review AUR file changes - review build & patching framework changesIf you&#x27;ve bothered to set up your own repos and build pipeline integrating your patches already (and you can get a lot of that for free), the additional overhead isn&#x27;t as large as it may sound.vscodium is doing the much larger work of cross-checking vscode and in exchange I do the smaller work of cross-checking theirs - and putting in my own so I have zeroconf installs with prebundled extensions and whatnot on new machines.Same for browser (ungoogled-chromium, vanadium, librewolf or whathaveyou) reply eternityforest 13 hours agoparentprevI trust big tech more than most FOSS.I&#x27;m not worried about the government spying on me or ad tracking, I&#x27;m worried about a random hacker.It&#x27;s ironic that for a lot of people the concept of privacy has been inverted: The closer someone is to you the more we want to hide from them.Facebook showing my online status to acquaintances(Or the lack of an online status, which could also create suspicion that I&#x27;m hiding something) bothers me more often than a random Google employee listening in through my alarm clock. reply pulpfictional 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not ironic, it&#x27;s concern over the influence big tech yields over society with said data, unlike your concerns which are scoped on you and immediate. reply eternityforest 11 hours agorootparentThe majority of people seem to have immediate -scoped concerns I suppose.Most of the really scary big data possibilities seems more like political issues than data issues, the data is just something they could use to do the things people are worried about.It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s competing for mind share with a lot of other possibile horrors people are afraid of and people are rather fatigued.The more subtle stuff they&#x27;re already doing seems like it would be a problem with even the most basic data.The biggest issue I see is personalized content which causes fights, hate, wasted time, and all that, because the algorithms want you to engage with it as much as possible, and it shits on real journalism by giving all the attention to clickbaits.I suspect every time I&#x27;ve responded to such clickbaits might be more problematic than all the data they get from all my smart devices in a year...Protecting one&#x27;s privacy because of societal harm is a worthy thing but also a pretty big effort and I sure don&#x27;t have a solution, or even any confident prediction of how big the problem is or where it&#x27;s coming from...But I probably won&#x27;t truly be worried unless one of those horrid encryption bans gets close to passing. reply pulpfictional 11 hours agorootparent> The majority of people seem to have immediate -scoped concerns I suppose.Well, like you write, aggregated data is already being used to influence populations which makes it immediate. An hypothetical hacker is not.> Most of the really scary big data possibilities seems more like political issues than data issues, the data is just something they could use to do the things people are worried about.I don&#x27;t follow. Not giving away the data removes the need for politics. Crime is illegal nevertheless it exists because it is possible to commit.> It&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s competing for mind share with a lot of other possibile horrors people are afraid of and people are rather fatigued.Not everyone shares the same concerns and nobody likes problems, that doesn&#x27;t&#x27; mean they should be accepted.> The more subtle stuff they&#x27;re already doing seems like it would be a problem with even the most basic data.All the more reason not to give them more. The personalized hate content is a direct consequence of big data aggregation.All in all, seems like more of an issue than a possible compromise of a FOSS project. reply lathiat 12 hours agoparentprevOn the one hand there is 100% validity to what you say. On the other, people download entire trees of dependencies from pypi, npm, homebrew, independent non sandboxed apps, chrome extensions, etc.So don’t lull yourself into thinking the supply chain on everything on your system is any better :) It’s likely substantially worse. reply ninjha 12 hours agoparentprevI would have assumed the win here would be that your Linux distribution or package manager on another OS can compile \"VSCodium\" themselves -- and you already trust them for all your other software, so this simplifies the trust chain somewhat.In reality I think distributions that are willing to ship binaries (NixOS, Homebrew on MacOS) ship VSCodium, and other distributions (Alpine) have packages called things like `code-oss` that are basically the distribution&#x27;s internal compiled version of VSCode and have nothing (?) to do with VSCodium. reply asddubs 14 hours agoparentprevI think skin in the game is the big one, much moreso than manpower. I use a lot of things that are probably mostly one-person projects, but if that person poured their love and time into it, it seems unlikely they&#x27;d permanently tarnish not just their reputation, but also the thing they spent all this time on. If you&#x27;re just setting a couple compile flags and changing a name, I am a little more suspicious reply d0mine 14 hours agoparentprev- option A: definite known spyware; - option B: maybe potentially one day there is an attack&#x2F;take over.The choice is obvious. reply croes 15 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t VSCodium just VSCode without the telemetry code?So if there is a supply chain risk it&#x27;s the same for VS Code reply krick 14 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re missing the point. GP is discussing binaries. I.e., the assumption is that published source code (on Github) is perfectly fine, and then either the (malign) developer is changing the code before compiling it, or the (malign) third party is somehow using some vulnerability to replace the official binaries with compiled code of their own. And then you think that you are using \"VSCode without the telemetry code\", but in reality you&#x27;re running a botnet. reply Retr0id 15 hours agorootparentprevThe supply chain does not end at the source code. reply croes 15 hours agorootparentWhat does VSCodium add? reply jamesgeck0 14 hours agorootparentIf their CI is one day compromised by an attacker, potentially anything. reply croes 14 hours agorootparentJust like MS&#x27;s CI, and I guess MS is the more valuable target. reply fredoliveira 12 hours agorootparentBut one might also assume, the hardest target to actually hit. replydavidgerard 13 hours agoparentprevIt could be much worse - you could install the official vendor binary, which is known to contain spyware. reply haolez 7 hours agorootparentSpyware sucks, but ransomware and joining a botnet suck much more. reply dist-epoch 15 hours agoparentprevYour approach is valid, if you also avoid npm&#x2F;pip&#x2F;cargo&#x2F;... packages. Otherwise... reply beAbU 14 hours agoparentprevThis is what happened to FileZilla I think? reply Barrin92 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not paranoid, the scepticism is completely warranted as this is security theatre. People are afraid Microsoft will screw them over with a text editor but run random binaries provided by people for whom a thousand bucks may as well be enough motivation to ship you malware.It&#x27;s like buying your heart medication off an anonymous guy on Craigslist to stick it to big pharma. reply RunSet 12 hours agorootparentBuying it for libre dollars and free cents. reply gostsamo 17 hours agoparentprevthis is using the ms source, just not the logo and signing key. should be as safe as they come. reply danpalmer 16 hours agorootparentThe signing key is the important bit though right? This project breaks the chain of trust, as it clones the source repo, [does some shady stuff?] builds a new release, and uploads it to GitHub.It&#x27;s unlikely that this project knowingly does shady stuff – I&#x27;ve heard of it before, seems to be a long running legit project – but there are lots of unverified factors in that, and the lack of signing (I think?) on the final binaries also means it&#x27;s hard to know if they get tampered with at some other step. reply robinwassen 17 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is most likely how do you know it&#x27;s the ms source unmodified? reply vorticalbox 16 hours agorootparentBecuase the repo uses github actions to pull changes and build the binaryhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VSCodium&#x2F;vscodium&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;.github&#x2F;wor... reply danpalmer 16 hours agorootparentHaving had a quick look through this workflow it seems to miss most opportunities to ensure a safe build.- Downloads binaries for use in build with no hash&#x2F;signing verification.- Doesn&#x27;t pin shared actions.- Uses Yarn to install dependencies (which can involve downloading&#x2F;executing arbitrary code from anywhere)- Doesn&#x27;t sign the final binary.None of this is necessarily wrong, all would make maintenance harder in the long run, but it means this project is really about removing MS branding and some telemetry, and that there is a security trade-off to get those benefits. reply benatkin 15 hours agorootparentNone of these are a big deal.> - Downloads binaries for use in build with no hash&#x2F;signing verification.It downloads them using TLS.> - Doesn&#x27;t pin shared actions.The shared actions are just @actions&#x2F;checkout and @actions&#x2F;setup-node.

For Mac OS X it does.Seems like FUD, which you might be able to recognize because you say \"None of this is necessarily wrong\". Especially the part about pinning first party GitHub Actions. There would be nothing wrong with that but it is much more useful to pin third party GitHub Actions, and IMHO suboptimal to pin first party actions. reply vladvasiliu 15 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the whole point of this comment thread \"vulnerabilities to supply chain attacks\"?>> - Downloads binaries for use in build with no hash&#x2F;signing verification.> It downloads them using TLS.If the binary is updated to a shady version, sure, no one will be able to tamper with the download, they&#x27;re certain to have received the correct shady stuff. reply danpalmer 15 hours agorootparentprevAh yes it does sign on macOS.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite FUD, but I do agree none of these are strictly necessary, all can be rationalised as unnecessary and for many users this project probably provides a perfectly reasonable security posture. However the fact that there&#x27;s so little explicit acknowledgement of the security concerns, and that 2 minutes looking at the repo turned these things up, suggests that security is not a priority of the project. Again, not the wrong thing to do, but maybe not the trade-offs all users will want.Pinning actions is so low effort&#x2F;high reward that even the low risk makes it worth it for a project like this in my opinion. Official actions are certainly much safer, but ultimately it&#x27;s still just human review and PRs being merged.Downloading over TLS negates some impact of hash&#x2F;signing verification, but it would be a nice extra layer. You&#x27;re otherwise putting a lot of trust in the combination of DNS+CDN+Hosting. I&#x27;ve seen hijacked sites due to IPs being re-used on cloud providers for example. Unlikely, but again easy to do and high impact in the rare situation that is is taken advantage of.Yarn dependencies may be carefully chosen, I&#x27;m not familiar with the VSCode practices. I bet that official binaries however are not built like this – I&#x27;d bet that there are allowances for specific network connectivity and binary execution, and that everything else is locked down. To my knowledge GitHub Actions have open internet access. I wouldn&#x27;t even say this is low risk either, the NPM ecosystem is so deeply nested that I&#x27;m sure malicious code could be snuck in somewhere. This is a lot harder to solve for this project, and certainly the most debatable aspect as to whether it&#x27;s worth it or not. reply lozenge 14 hours agorootparentThe yarn.lock includes checksums, if yarn is not checking checksums properly then that affects every project in Node.js, not just this one.Malicious code with the correct checksum? VSCode team is not auto updating dependencies but I also doubt they are reviewing the source code of every package they update. I&#x27;ve never worked anywhere that does. So yeah, \"gulp-vinyl-zip\" (or any other package used at build time) could add some code that secretly triggers when run in the VSCode repository and makes some malicious source code changes. But, it&#x27;s still going to be the same code in VSCode and VSCodium. Unless the attacker decides to use specific logic to target one or the other. reply benatkin 15 hours agorootparentprev> low effort&#x2F;high rewardAre there any shared actions that aren&#x27;t actions&#x2F;name-of-project?

Pylance, their Python LSP, is one notable example [2]. Their earlier Python LSP was open source, but the community forks have lost a lot of the wind in their sails because such a large portion of developers use VC Code without realizing or caring that the LSP is DRM-laden and closed source. I believe the traditional term for this is embrace, extend, extinguish.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parsiya.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021-12-20-rce-in-visual-studio-cod...[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;pylance-release&#x2F;issues&#x2F;746 reply cypress66 15 hours agorootparentWow, vscode extensions having drm is insane reply vladvasiliu 15 hours agorootparentThis alone, to me, means that MS is up to something shady. Maybe not right now, maybe not tomorrow, but it&#x27;s surely on their roadmap.I don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d put out an open-source app, whose most useful extensions only work if you accept a closed binary known to phone home.I can see them trying to win goodwill from devs and steer them to their Azure&#x2F;Windows offerings by releasing such an editor. But why insist on this telemetry-laden distribution, which is still free-as-in-beer? reply foob 14 hours agorootparentThis is separate from the telemetry, but I suspect that part of the roadmap is for LSP extensions to become monthly subscription services eventually. We currently see hints of that from two directions: 1) the introduction of GitHub Copilot as a paid service, and 2) the aforementioned move towards proprietary and DRM protected LSPs. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine how these two might converge in the future. I&#x27;m sure that the performance of these LSPs will be extremely impressive and that it will be rational for many individual developers to pay for them. This will in turn pull mind share and community involvement away from FOSS solutions, and the gap between the two will widen over time as a result. reply vladvasiliu 14 hours agorootparentOh, I&#x27;m not at all against companies making a buck selling software. I&#x27;m a happy JetBrains customer for my IDE needs, and I&#x27;m not even a \"professional\" developer.But why would they force the use of their \"official\" VS Code build for this? Couldn&#x27;t they just charge for their \"impressive\" plugins, regardless of the edition of VS Code used? The JetBrains \"community\" IDEs (open source and gratis) can use paid plugins from their marketplace. reply foob 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not against selling developer tools either, but I do have a problem with EEE as a strategy. As far as I know, JetBrains has never engaged with this behavior and they have coexisted in a healthy way with fully open source alternatives. The point of Microsoft&#x27;s strategy isn&#x27;t to only produce a better product, but to actively hurt open alternatives by driving down their adoption through insidious and disingenuous means. They&#x27;re not just trying to compete in the market, they&#x27;re trying to monopolize it.The idea behind LSP and Microsoft&#x27;s initial open source work on LSP were both excellent. That launched seven years ago, and I don&#x27;t think that we would have seen the near universal adoption of LSP among open source editors nor the dominance of VS Code among developers if they had been paid products from the start. Now that they have a large enough market share, they can make the LSP engines proprietary without most developers even noticing. The gap between the proprietary and open source solutions can now be widened both by the open source community shrinking and by Microsoft pumping money into improving their LSP engines. The more that gap widens, the more people migrate to VS Code from open alternatives. That becomes a self-reinforcing loop.Once VS Code is significantly better than open source alternatives and they have a huge market share, Microsoft is in a very strong position to start collecting rent. Switching costs on an editor are nontrivial to begin with, and are enhanced by the induced atrophy of open source alternatives. Despite the fact that this strategy takes more than a decade to execute, I would guess that it ends better for Microsoft overall than if they were to start charging for VS Code back in 2016. reply vladvasiliu 6 hours agorootparentSo do you think their goal is to reel back in the people who had already left OG VS and also a bunch of new ones by slowly boiling the frog with the closed distribution of vscode, which will gradually have all the best features and, maybe, in the end, become paid again? I would have thought that they were merely trying to push their own cloud and cloud-adjacent ecosystem, which I expect to be the real cash cows. reply nerdponx 11 hours agorootparentprevMaybe instead of \"embrace, extend, extinguish\", it&#x27;s \"promote, extend, prevent competitors from extending, then charge for extensions\".Paid monthly premium LSP subscription honestly would be a great idea from a business perspective, even though it&#x27;s distasteful. reply nerdponx 11 hours agorootparentprevUpsells like Copilot, telemetry data mining, investing in the goodwill of an entire generation of programmers, and presumably further plans related to enterprise products. reply bitwize 14 hours agorootparentprevYou know the \"Editor Wars\" meme? That was a thing because vim and Emacs were the canonical editors; you could expect just about every serious hacker (in a Unix environment) to main either one or the other.Today, there is only one canonical editor: Visual Studio Code. 75% of professional programmers use it. Microsoft was trying to get the open source crowd back into their tooling fold -- and they&#x27;ve succeeded! Which means now they have a hugely expanded developer base to sell tools and services to. Remember their money is now in cloud, not desktop software -- so think things like GitHub Codespaces. (The entire devcontainer ecosystem comes from Microsoft and is oriented specifically around Visual Studio Code&#x27;s model of remote development.) reply vladvasiliu 14 hours agorootparentSure I do, and I enjoy flaming the occasional Emacs user I cross paths with.But why does selling those features, especially the ones requiring a separate cloud subscription, require a specific build of an app which is otherwise open source? reply bitwize 14 hours agorootparentFlip it on its head, the question is, why even do an open source release? The answer is, it&#x27;s pretty much a sop, much like Apple&#x27;s Darwin releases or the AOSP. Good PR for the open source community to build trust and good will, while still controlling the whole platform from soup to nuts making EEE possible. If they opened up their dev tools -- their LSPs and cloud service connectivity -- to just anybody they risk losing that control.Honestly, the more I learn about Visual Studio Code the more I understand why Emacs is the way it is. Stallman was trying to keep it fully hackable forever. reply vladvasiliu 14 hours agorootparentI admit, I didn&#x27;t think about it under that angle.But I do wonder how much VS Code being \"kinda open source\" mattered. I may be in an MS-centric bubble, but most people I interact with couldn&#x27;t care less about that. They&#x27;re using closed-source software all over. Their main reasons for switching to VS Code seem to be the free-as-in-beer part, and that it&#x27;s more practical than the OG VisualStudio.

Which isn&#x27;t very objective I know, but is important for an app that I spend several hours a day in.There&#x27;s some visual stuff: The default views, font choices and colours are really nicely put together (and I&#x27;ve tried tweaking VSCode to match but I can&#x27;t get it to look as nice). For example, when viewing a git diff, it displays sweeping curves, which move and bend as you scroll, connecting the changes on both sides.There&#x27;s some Panic stuff: I like the integration with Transmit (which I use all the time). And I used to use the \"publish\" function all the time (develop on macOS and push to a Linux box to run tests etc).And there&#x27;s the fact that it&#x27;s a native Mac app - I&#x27;m an old-school Mac user and there&#x27;s a definite difference in \"feel\" between Mac apps and others. I&#x27;m not a purist about it (I have tons of Electron stuff installed), but when I use a Mac app I notice it. Plus I often get VSCode randomly slowing down to a crawl causing lots of annoying type-ahead, which doesn&#x27;t happen with Nova - which I guess is a combination of Electron, JS and extensions combining.But Panic has a reputation for sweating the details and it shows throughout the UI. Plus I feel good supporting a tiny company working in a niche market.But functionality-wise it falls way short of VSCode - especially with extensions and dev-containers. The way VSCode + Remote Docker Containers feels like you&#x27;re developing locally when actually everything is happening in a container on a Linux box somewhere halfway across the world is quite amazing. reply zogrodea 1 hour agorootparentThank you for the time and effort you took to write down your thoughts!

In fact, proprietary licenses are better as well; with MIT or BSD licenses you are writing code that a corporation will make proprietary, effectively writing proprietary code for them, except you don&#x27;t get paid for it. It would be better to use a proprietary license and get paid than to use the BSD&#x2F;MIT license, have your code turned into that same proprietary product, and not even get paid for it.Even giving your code to the public domain is better than an MIT or BSD license; corporations will still be able to make it proprietary but at least it clears the air around the &#x27;interesting question&#x27; of mixing MIT&#x2F;BSD code into a copyleft project and distributing the whole lot under a copyleft license. reply CrendKing 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s pretty naive.

They&#x27;d have to make the open part progressively worse. reply hedora 15 hours agorootparentIt is a platform play, where the platform increasingly becomes incompatible with the open core stuff.The value of a lot of software comes from interoperability, not from the code itself.For instance, try running AOSP and 100% open source system libraries on your android phone for a month. You will find that you cannot perform basic financial transactions, like paying for parking, or hailing an uber&#x2F;lyft, fast-charge your car, attend concerts without paying an extra fee, etc, etc.I don’t even want my phone to support any of the above crap, but I don’t get to dictate how the US economy is structured, so I have no choice but to need all that stuff to work. reply lozenge 13 hours agorootparentprevIt is progressively worse now.What used to be useful extras are now considered essentials (see how many on this thread say they need the SSH, Docker or WSL extensions and can&#x27;t use VSCodium).Plus they&#x27;re now moving Python, .NET and other specific extensions towards closed source. Yeah, you can use the open source versions, but they don&#x27;t have mindshare any more so source code written with one might not navigate&#x2F;display as well with the other.Also, new features only land when MS has a closed source idea that can use it, and are locked to MS extensions only.

    "title": "Writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python",
    "originLink": "https://vgel.me/posts/c500/",
    "originBody": "VGEL.ME blog fiction contact github itch.io Writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python August 30, 2023 A few months ago, I set myself the challenge of writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python1, after writing my SDF donut post. How hard could it be? The answer was, pretty hard, even when dropping quite a few features. But it was also pretty interesting, and the result is surprisingly functional and not too hard to understand! There's too much code for me to comprehensively cover in a single blog post2, so I'll just give an overview of the decisions I made, things I had to cut, and the general architecture of the compiler, touching on a representative piece of each part. Hopefully after reading this post, the code is more approachable! Decisions, decisions The first, and most critical decision, was that this would be a single-pass compiler. 500 lines is too spare to be defining and transforming an abstract syntax tree! What does that mean? Most compilers: faffing around with syntax trees Well, most compiler's internals look something like this: The tokens get lexed, then a parser runs over them and builds pretty little syntax trees: # hypothetical code, not from anywhere def parse_statement(lexer) -> PrettyLittleSyntaxTree: ... if type := lexer.try_next(TYPE_NAME): variable_name = lexer.next(IDENTIFIER) if lexer.try_next(\"=\"): initializer = parse_initializer(lexer) else: initializer = None lexer.next(SEMICOLON) return VariableDeclarationNode( type = type, name = variable_name, initializer = initializer, ) ... # much later... def emit_code_for(node: PrettyLittleSyntaxTree) -> DisgustingMachineCode: ... if isinstance(node, VariableDeclarationNode): slot = reserve_stack_space(node.type.sizeof()) add_to_environment(node.name, slot) if node.initializer is not None: register = emit_code_for(node.initializer) emit(f\"mov {register}, [{slot}]\") ... The important thing here is that there's two passes, first the parsing builds up a syntax tree, then a second pass chews that tree up and turns it into machine code. That's really useful for most compilers! It keeps the parsing and codegen separate, so each can evolve independently. It also means that you can transform the syntax tree before using it to generate code—for example, by applying optimizations to it. In fact, most compilers have multiple levels of \"intermediate representations\" between the syntax tree and codegen! This is really great, good engineering, best practices, recommended by experts, etc. But… it takes too much code, so we can't do it. Instead, we'll be single-pass: code generation happens during parsing. We parse a bit, emit some code, parse a bit more, emit a bit more code. So for example, here's some real code from the c500 compiler for parsing the prefix ~ op: # lexer.try_next() checks if the next token is ~, and if so, consumes # and returns it (truthy) elif lexer.try_next(\"~\"): # prefix() parses and generates code for the expression after the ~, # and load_result emits code to load it, if needed meta = load_result(prefix()) # immediately start yeeting out the negation code! emit(\"i32.const 0xffffffff\") emit(\"i32.xor\") # webassembly only supports 32bit types, so if this is a smaller type, # mask it down mask_to_sizeof(meta.type) # return type information return meta Notice there's no syntax trees, no PrefixNegateOp nodes. We see some tokens and immediately spit out the corresponding instructions. You may have noticed those instructions are WebAssembly, which leads us into the next section... Using WebAssembly, for some reason? So I decided to make the compiler target WebAssembly. I honestly don't know why I did this, it really didn't make it easier—I guess I was just curious? WebAssembly is a really weird target, especially for C. Besides the somewhat-external issues like spending a lot of time confused before I realized WebAssembly v2 is pretty different than WebAssembly v1, the instruction set itself is weird. For one, there's no goto. Instead, you have blocks—structured assembly, imagine that!—and \"break\" instructions that jump to either the beginning or end of a specific nesting-level of block. This was basically inconsequential for if and while, but made implementing for extremely cursed, which we'll go over later. Additionally, WebAssembly doesn't have registers, it has a stack, and is a stack machine. At first you might think that's awesome, right? C needs a stack! We can just use the WebAssembly stack as our C stack! Nope, because you can't take references to the WebAssembly stack. So instead, we need to maintain our own in-memory stack anyways, and then shuffle it on and off of the WASM parameter stack. So in the end, I think I ended up with slightly more code than I would have needed to target a more normal ISA like x86 or ARM. But it was interesting! And theoretically, you could run code compiled with c500 in a browser, although I haven't tried (I just use the wasmer CLI). Error handling It basically doesn't. There's a function die, which is called when anything weird happens and dumps a compiler stack trace—if you're lucky, you get a line number and a somewhat-vague error message. ------------------------------ File \"...compiler.py\", line 835, incompile(\"\".join(fi)) # todo: make this line-at-a-time? File \"...compiler.py\", line 823, in compile global_declaration(global_frame, lexer)File \"...compiler.py\", line 417, in value var, offset = frame.get_var_and_offset(varname) File \"...compiler.py\", line 334, in get_var_and_offset return self.parent.get_var_and_offset(name) File \"...compiler.py\", line 336, in get_var_and_offset die(f\"unknown variable {n}\", None if isinstance(name, str) else name.line) File \"...compiler.py\", line 14, in die traceback.print_stack() ------------------------------ error on line 9: unknown variable c The Rust compiler, this is not :-) What to drop Finally, I had to decide what not to support, since it just wasn't feasible to get all of C into 500 lines. (sorry!) I decided I wanted a really decent sampling of features that tested what the general implementation approach was capable of—for example, if I had skipped pointers, I could have just gotten away with the WASM parameter stack and shed a lot of complexity, but that would have felt like cheating. I ended up implementing the following features: arithmetic operations and binary operators, with proper precedence int, short, and char types string constants (with escapes) pointers (of however many levels), including correct pointer arithmetic (incrementing an int* adds 4) arrays (only single-level, not int[][]) functions typedefs (and the lexer hack!) Notably, it doesn't support: structs :-( would be possible with more code, the fundamentals were there, I just couldn't squeeze it in enums / unions preprocessor directives (this would probably be 500 lines by itself...) floating point. would also be possible, the wasm_type stuff is in, again just couldn't squeeze it in 8 byte types (long/long long or double) some other small things like pre/post cremements, in-place initialization, etc., which just didn't quite fit any sort of standard library or i/o that isn't returning an integer from main() casting expressions The compiler passes 34/220 test cases in the c-testsuite. More importantly to me, it can compile and run the following program successfully: int swap(int* a, int* b) { int t; t = *a; *a = *b; *b = t; return t; } int fib(int n) { int a, b; for (a = b = 1; n > 2; n = n - 1) { swap(&a, &b); b = b + a; } return b; } int main() { return fib(10); // 55 } OK, enough about deciding things, let's get into the code! Helper types There's a small collection of helper types and classes that the compiler uses. None of them are particularly strange, so I'll pass over them fairly quickly. Emitter (compiler.py:21) This is a singleton helper to emit nicely-formatted WebAssembly code. WebAssembly, at least the textual format, is formatted as s-expressions, but individual instructions don't need to be parenthesized: (module ;;(func $swap (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32) global.get $__stack_pointer ;; prelude -- adjust stack pointer i32.const 12 i32.sub ;;) ) Emitter just helps with emitting code with nice indentation so it's easier to read. It also has a no_emit method, which will be used for an ugly hack later—stay tuned! StringPool (compiler.py:53) StringPool holds all the string constants so they can be arranged in a contiguous region of memory, and hands out addresses into that for the codegen to use. When you write char *s = \"abc\" in c500, what really happens is: StringPool appends a null terminator StringPool checks if it's already stored \"abc\", and if so, just hands that address back Otherwise, StringPool adds it to a dictionary along with the base address + the total byte length stored so far—the address of this new string in the pool StringPool hands that address back When all the code is finished compiling, we create an rodata section with the giant concatenated string produced by StringPool, stored at the string pool base address (retroactively making all the addresses StringPool handed out valid) Lexer (compiler.py:98) The Lexer class is complex, because lexing C is complex ((\\\\([\\\\abfnrtv'\"?]|[0-7]{1,3}|x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2})) is a real regex in that code for character escapes), but conceptually simple: the lexer marches along identifying what the token at the current position is. The caller can peek that token, or it can use next to tell the lexer to advance, \"consuming\" that token. It can also use try_next to conditionally advance only if the next token is a certain kind—basically, try_next is a shortcut for if self.peek().kind == token: return self.next(). There's some additionally complexity because of something called the \"lexer hack\". Essentially, when parsing C you want to know if something is a type name or variable name (because that context matters for compiling certain expressions), but there's no syntactic distinction between them: int int_t = 0; is perfectly valid C, as is typedef int int_t; int_t x = 0;. To know if an arbitrary token int_t is a type name or a variable name, we need to feed type information from the parsing/codegen stage back into the lexer. This is a giant pain for regular compilers that want to keep their lexer, parser, and codegen modules pure and plantonically separate, but it's actually not very hard for us! I'll explain it more when we get to the typedef section, but basically we just keep types: set[str] in Lexer, and when lexing, check if a token is in that set before giving it a token kind: if m := re.match(r\"^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\", self.src[self.loc :]): tok = m.group(0) ... # lexer hack return Token(TOK_TYPE if tok in self.types else TOK_NAME, tok, self.line) CType (compiler.py:201) This is just a dataclass for representing information about a C type, like you'd write in int **t or short t[5] or char **t[17], minus the t. It contains: the type's name (with any typedefs resolved), such as int or short what level of pointer is is (0 = not a pointer, 1 = int *t, 2 = int **t, and so on) what the array size is (None = not an array, 0 = int t[0], 1 = int t[1], and so on) Notably, as mentioned before, this type only supports single-level arrays, and not nested arrays like int t[5][6]. FrameVar and StackFrame (compiler.py:314) These classes handle our C stack frames. As I mentioned before, because you can't take references to the WASM stack, we have to manually handle the C stack, we can't use the WASM one. To set up the C stack, the prelude emitted in __main__ sets up a global __stack_pointer variable, and then every function call decrements that by however much space the function needs for its parameters and local variables—calculated by that function's StackFrame instance. I'll go over how that calculation works in more detail when we get to parsing functions, but essentially, each parameter and local variable gets a slot in that stack space, and increases StackFrame.frame_size (and thus the offset of the next variable) depending on its size. The offset, type information, and other data for each parameter and local variable are stored in a FrameVar instance, in StackFrame.variables, in order of declaration. ExprMeta (compiler.py:344) This final dataclass is used to track whether the result of an expression is a value or a place. We need to keep track of this distinction in order to handle certain expressions differently based on how they're used. For example, if you have a variable x of type int, it can be used in two ways: x + 1 wants the value of x, say 1, to operate on &x wants the address of x, say 0xcafedead When we parse the x expression, we can easily fetch the address from the stack frame: # look the variable up in the `StackFrame` var, offset = frame.get_var_and_offset(varname) # put the base address of the C stack on top of the WASM stack emit(f\"global.get $__stack_pointer\") # add the offset (in the C stack) emit(f\"i32.const {offset}\") emit(\"i32.add\") # the address of the variable is now on top of the WASM stack But now what? If we i32.load this address to get the value, then &x will have no way to get the address. But if we don't load it, then x + 1 will try to add one to the address, resulting in 0xcafedeae instead of 2! That's where ExprMeta comes in: we leave the address on the stack, and return an ExprMeta indicating this is a place: return ExprMeta(True, var.type) Then, for operations like + that always want to operate on values instead of places, there's a function load_result that turns any places into values: def load_result(em: ExprMeta) -> ExprMeta: \"\"\"Load a place `ExprMeta`, turning it into a value `ExprMeta` of the same type\"\"\" if em.is_place: # emit i32.load, i32.load16_s, etc., based on the type emit(em.type.load_ins()) return ExprMeta(False, em.type) ... # in the code for parsing `+` lhs_meta = load_result(parse_lhs()) ... Meanwhile, an operation like & just doesn't load the result, and instead leaves the address on the stack: in an important sense, & is a no-op in our compiler, since it doesn't emit any code! if lexer.try_next(\"&\"): meta = prefix() if not meta.is_place: die(\"cannot take reference to value\", lexer.line) # type of &x is int* when x is int, hence more_ptr return ExprMeta(False, meta.type.more_ptr()) Note also that, despite being an address, the result of & isn't a place! (The code returns an ExprMeta with is_place=False.) The result of & should be treated like a value, since &x + 1 should add 1 (or rather, sizeof(x)) to the address. That's why we need the place/value distinction, since just \"being an address\" isn't enough to know whether the result of an expression should be loaded. OK, enough about helper classes. Let's move on to the meat of codegen! Parsing and code generation The general control flow of the compiler goes like this: The blue rectangles represent the main functions of the compiler—__main__, compile(), global_declaration(), statement(), and expression(). The long chain of squares at the bottom shows the operator precedence—most of those functions are automatically generated by a higher-order function, however! I'll go through the blue squares one-by-one and explain anything interesting in each. __main__ (compiler.py:827) This one is pretty short and dull. Here it is in full: if __name__ == \"__main__\": import fileinput with fileinput.input(encoding=\"utf-8\") as fi: compile(\"\".join(fi)) # todo: make this line-at-a-time? Clearly I never finished that TODO! The only really interesting thing here is the fileinput module, which you may not have heard of. From the module docs, Typical use is: import fileinput for line in fileinput.input(encoding=\"utf-8\"): process(line) This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:], defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty. If a filename is '-' it is also replaced by sys.stdin and the optional arguments mode and openhook are ignored. To specify an alternative list of filenames, pass it as the argument to input(). A single file name is also allowed. This means, technically, c500 supports multiple files! (If you don't mind them all being concatenated and having messed-up line numbers :-) fileinput is actually fairly sophisticated and has a filelineno() method, I just didn't use it for space reasons.) compile() (compiler.py:805) compile() is the first interesting function here, and is short enough to also include verbatim: def compile(src: str) -> None: # compile an entire file with emit.block(\"(module\", \")\"): emit(\"(memory 3)\") emit(f\"(global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const {PAGE_SIZE * 3}))\") emit(\"(func $__dup_i32 (param i32) (result i32 i32)\") emit(\" (local.get 0) (local.get 0))\") emit(\"(func $__swap_i32 (param i32) (param i32) (result i32 i32)\") emit(\" (local.get 1) (local.get 0))\") global_frame = StackFrame() lexer = Lexer(src, set([\"int\", \"char\", \"short\", \"long\", \"float\", \"double\"])) while lexer.peek().kind != TOK_EOF: global_declaration(global_frame, lexer) emit('(export \"main\" (func $main))') # emit str_pool data section emit(f'(data $.rodata (i32.const {str_pool.base}) \"{str_pool.pooled()}\")') This function handles emitting the module level prelude. First, we emit a pragma for the WASM VM to reserve 3 pages of memory ((memory 3)), and we set the stack pointer to start at the end of that reserved region (it will grow downwards). Then, we define two stack manipulation helpers __dup_i32 and __swap_i32. These should be familiar if you've ever used Forth: dup duplicates the item on top of the WASM stack (a -- a a), and swap swaps the position of the top two items on the WASM stack (a b -- b a). Next, we initialize a stack frame to hold the global variables, initialize the lexer with the built-in typenames for the lexer hack, and chew up global declarations until we run out! Finally, we export main and dump the string pool. global_declaration() (compiler.py:743) This function is too long to inline the whole thing, but the signature looks like this: def global_declaration(global_frame: StackFrame, lexer: Lexer) -> None: # parse a global declaration -- typedef, global variable, or function. ... It handles typedefs, global variables, and functions. Typedefs are cool, since this is where the lexer hack happens! if lexer.try_next(\"typedef\"): # yes, `typedef int x[24];` is valid (but weird) c type, name = parse_type_and_name(lexer) # lexer hack! lexer.types.add(name.content) typedefs[name.content] = type lexer.next(\";\") return We reuse a general type-name parsing tool since typedefs inherit all of C's weird \"declaration reflects usage\" rules, which is convenient for us. (and less so for the perplexed newbie!) Then we inform the lexer we've discovered a new type name, so that in the future that token will be lexed as a type name instead of a variable name. Finally for typedefs, we store the type in the global typedef registry, consume the trailing semicolon, and return back to compile() for the next global declaration. Importantly, the type we store is a whole parsed type, since if you do typedef int* int_p; and then later write int_p *x, x should get a resulting type of int**—the pointer level is additive! That means we can't just store the base C typename, and instead need to store an entire CType. If the declaration wasn't a typedef, we parse a variable type and name. If we find a ; token we know it's a global variable declaration (since we don't support global initializers). In that case, we add the global variable to the global stack frame and bail. if lexer.try_next(\";\"): global_frame.add_var(name.content, decl_type, False) return If there's no semicolon, however, we're definitely dealing with a function. To generate code for a function, we need to: Make a new StackFrame for the function, named frame Then, parse all the parameters and store them in the frame with frame.add_var(varname.content, type, is_parameter=True) After that, parse all the variable declarations with variable_declaration(lexer, frame), which adds them to frame Now we know how large the function's stack frame needs to be (frame.frame_size), so we can start emitting the prelude! First, for all the parameters in the stack frame (added with is_parameter=True), we generate WASM param declarations so the function can be called with the WASM calling convention (passing the parameters on the WASM stack): for v in frame.variables.values(): if v.is_parameter: emit(f\"(param ${v.name} {v.type.wasmtype})\") Then, we can emit a result annotation for the return type, and adjust the C stack pointer to make space for the function's parameters and variables: emit(f\"(result {decl_type.wasmtype})\") emit(\"global.get $__stack_pointer\") # grow the stack downwards emit(f\"i32.const {frame.frame_offset + frame.frame_size}\") emit(\"i32.sub\") emit(\"global.set $__stack_pointer\") For each parameter (in reverse order, because stacks), copy it from the WASM stack to our stack: for v in reversed(frame.variables.values()): if v.is_parameter: emit(\"global.get $__stack_pointer\") emit(f\"i32.const {frame.get_var_and_offset(v.name)[1]}\") emit(\"i32.add\") # fetch the variable from the WASM stack emit(f\"local.get ${v.name}\") # and store it at the calculated address in the C stack emit(v.type.store_ins()) Finally, we can call statement(lexer, frame) in a loop to codegen all the statements in the function, until we hit the closing bracket: while not lexer.try_next(\"}\"): statement(lexer, frame) Bonus step: we assume the function will always have a return, so we emit(\"unreachable\") so the WASM analyzer doesn't freak out. Whoof! That was a lot. But that's all for functions, and thus for global_declaration(), so let's move on to statement(). statement() (compiler.py:565) There's a lot of code in statement(). However, most of it is fairly repetitive, so I'll just explain while and for, which should give a good overview. Remember how WASM doesn't have jumps, and instead has structured control flow? That's relevant now. First, let's see how it works with while, where it's not too much trouble. A while loop in WASM looks like this: block loop ;;i32.eqz br_if 1 ;;br 0 end end As you can see, there are two types of blocks—block and loop (there's also an if block type, which I didn't use). Each encloses some number of statements and then ends with end. Inside a block, you can break with br, or conditionally based on the top of the WASM stack with br_if (there's also br_table, which I didn't use). The br family takes a labelidx parameter, here either 1 or 0, which is what level of block the operation applies to. So in our while loop, the br_if 1 applies to the outer block—index 1, while the br 0 applies to the inner block—index 0. (indices are always relative to the instruction in question—0 is the innermost block to that instruction.) Finally, the last rule to know is that a br in a block jumps forwards, to the end of the block, whereas a br in a loop jumps backwards, to the beginning of the loop. So hopefully the while loop code makes sense now! Looking at it again, block loop ;;i32.eqz ;; if test == 0, jump forwards (1 = labelidx of the `block`), ;; out of the loop br_if 1 ;;;; unconditionally jump backwards (0 = labelidx of the `loop`). ;; to the beginning of the loop br 0 end end In more normal assembly, this would correspond to: .loop_start ;;jz .block_end ;;jmp .loop_start .block_end But with jumps, you can express things that you can't (easily) in WASM—for example, you could jump into the middle of a block. (This mainly is an issue for compiling C's goto, which I didn't even attempt—there's an algorithm that can transform any code using goto into an equivalent program using structured control flow, but it's complicated and I don't think it would work with our single-pass approach.) But for while loops, this isn't too bad. All we have to do is: # `emit.block` is a context manager to emit the first parameter (\"block\" here), # and then the second (\"end\") on exit with emit.block(\"block\", \"end\"): with emit.block(\"loop\", \"end\"): # emit code for the test, ending with `i32.eqz` parenthesized_test() # emit code to exit the loop if the `i32.eqz` was true emit(\"br_if 1\") # emit code for the body bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame) # emit code to jump back to the beginning emit(\"br 0\") With for loops though, it gets nasty. Consider a for loop like this: for (i = 0; iloop ;;br_if 1 ;;;;br 0 end end Notice that 3 and 4 are inverted in the generated code, making the order 1, 2, 4, 3. This is a problem for a single pass compiler! Unlike a normal compiler, we can't store the advancement statement for later. Or… can we? How I ended up handling this is by making the lexer cloneable, and re-parsing the advancement statement after parsing the body. Essentially, the code looks like: elif lexer.try_next(\"for\"): lexer.next(\"(\") with emit.block(\"block\", \"end\"): # parse initializer (i = 0) # (outside of loop since it only happens once) if lexer.peek().kind != \";\": expression(lexer, frame) emit(\"drop\") # discard result of initializer lexer.next(\";\") with emit.block(\"loop\", \"end\"): # parse test (iExprMeta: # lhs is the higher precedence operation (prefix operators, in this case) lhs_meta = prefix() # check if we can parse an operation if lexer.peek().kind in (\"*\", \"/\", \"%\"): # if so, load in the left hand side lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta) # grab the specific operator op_token = lexer.next() # the right hand side should use this function, for e.g. `x * y * z` load_result(muldiv()) # emit an opcode to do the operation if op_token == \"*\": emit(f\"i32.mul\") elif op_token == \"/\": emit(f\"i32.div_s\") else: # % emit(f\"i32.rem_s\") # mask down the result if this is a less-than-32bit type mask_to_sizeof(lhs_meta.type) # we produced a value (is_place=False) return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type) # if we didn't find a token, just return the left hand side unchanged return lhs_meta In fact, this pattern is so consistent that most operations, including muldiv, aren't written out, but instead defined by a higher-order function makeop: # function for generating simple operator precedence levels from declarative # dictionaries of { token: instruction_to_emit } def makeop( higher: Callable[[], ExprMeta], ops: dict[str, str], rtype: CTypeNone = None ) -> Callable[[], ExprMeta]: def op() -> ExprMeta: lhs_meta = higher() if lexer.peek().kind in ops.keys(): lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta) op_token = lexer.next() load_result(op()) # TODO: type checking? emit(f\"{ops[op_token.kind]}\") mask_to_sizeof(rtype or lhs_meta.type) return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type) return lhs_meta return op muldiv = makeop(prefix, {\"*\": \"i32.mul\", \"/\": \"i32.div_s\", \"%\": \"i32.rem_s\"}) ... shlr = makeop(plusminus, {\">\": \"i32.shr_s\"}) cmplg = makeop( shlr, {\"\": \"i32.gt_s\", \"=\": \"i32.ge_s\"}, CType(\"int\"), ) cmpe = makeop(cmplg, {\"==\": \"i32.eq\", \"!=\": \"i32.ne\"}, CType(\"int\")) bitand = makeop(cmpe, {\"&\": \"i32.and\"}) bitor = makeop(bitand, {\"|\": \"i32.or\"}) xor = makeop(bitor, {\"^\": \"i32.xor\"}) ... Only a few operations with special behavior need to be defined explicitly, like plusminus which needs to handle the nuances of C pointer math. And that's it! That's the last main piece of the compiler. Wrapping up... That's been our tour of the C compiler in 500 lines of Python! Compilers have a reputation for being complex—GCC and Clang are massive, and even TCC, the Tiny C Compiler, is tens of thousands of lines of code—but if you're willing to sacrifice code quality and do everything in a single pass, they can be surprisingly compact! I'd be interested to hear if you write your own single-pass compiler—maybe for a custom language? I think this kind of compiler could potentially be a great stage0 for a self-hosted language, since it's so simple. Next time, this blog will be back to regularly-scheduled LLM posting with a post about making a small transformer by hand!

I&#x27;m a self-taught developer, who also obtained two Masters and a Ph.D. later, and I can attest to it that the speed of learning at uni cannot be compared with the speed of learning via self study, especially self-study in isolation.Having said this, learning only in groups&#x2F;herds is also not the best approach IMHO, there is something to sitting alone and figuring something out without external help, at least occasionally, as it trains your analytical skills, your ability to concentrate and it gives you grit&#x2F;perseverance. reply LudwigNagasena 9 hours agorootparentLectures were made obsolete by Gutenberg.

Instead, the state should provide up to 10 years of vocational education (splittable and redeemable at any point in life) or 8 years of university education (subject to a B or better average in high school).Most vocational programs would be under 3 years, so you’d get three-four cracks at finding the right profession for you.University track would be targeted at educators, researchers and entrepreneurs.I think this would be better for every socioeconomic demographic in the US, and also help alleviate the housing shortage, enable modern manufacturing, fix many current issues with healthcare, and so on.) reply convolvatron 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m largely taught outside the academic world. so I sympathize with your position.however, the engineering culture which took the time to tell me about all these cool things and let me grow into being an expert in them seems to be largely gone. reply rewmie 13 hours agoparentprev> But, writing a C compiler in 500 of comprehensible code (even in python) is challenge in itself that may take months after a few years of solid learning.The people behind this project avoided that caveat by simply not implementing C.

Would it become a \"real\" compiler if someone built a machine that runs on WebAssembly instead of running it virtually?The popular opinion is that splitting hairs about this is useless, and the definition of a compiler has thus relaxed to include \"transpilers\" as well as machine code targeting compilers (at least in my dev circles). reply golemarms 7 hours agoprevCool.

    "originBody": "NEWS ▼ CONTACT SUBSCRIBE TV Museum Will Die in 48 Hours Unless Sony Retracts YouTube Copyright Strikes yesterday by Andy Maxwell HOME > ANTI-PIRACY > DMCA > Rick Klein and his team have been preserving TV adverts, forgotten tapes, and decades-old TV programming for years. Now operating as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Museum of Classic Chicago Television has called YouTube home since 2007. However, copyright notices sent on behalf of Sony, protecting TV shows between 40 and 60 years old, could shut down the project in 48 hours. The advent of the internet and its subsequent development in the mainstream have given rise to a perpetual, collaborative, global recording machine that would’ve been unimaginable 40+ years ago. Back then, videotape recording machines were cutting edge and a type developed by Sony was fighting for its life. Since Sony’s Betamax-format recorders were able to record TV shows, studios including Universal and Disney sought to hold Sony liable for users’ alleged copyright infringements. In 1984 the Supreme Court ultimately sided with Sony but had the decision gone the other way, the chilling effect on the video market would’ve been incalculable. The Museum of Classic Chicago Television Through the prism of history, The Museum of Classic Chicago Television owes much to Sony’s win in the Betamax case; quite possibly its very existence. Like many labors of love, its beginnings were humble. After finding a 1983 episode of “The Bozo Show” on an old videocassette, Rick Klein – today the museum’s president and lead curator – spotted himself and his brother in the audience. The trip down memory lane, punctuated by shifts in production values, fashions and commercial breaks, had him hooked. “I was just blown away by seeing stuff I had forgotten,” Klein recalled in a 2021 interview. “That’s one of the things that becomes so addictive. You see something and remember. It’s just like a key going into a lock.” Now close to reaching his own half century, Klein, and a number of like-minded individuals, still haven’t shaken the nostalgia bug, especially for old TV content shown locally in Chicago. In 2007, their growing collection of analog commercials, TV clips and other TV memorabilia, ventured into the all-digital online world. Tapes would stretch and snap no more but here, entire collections could be wiped out in an instant. A New Beginning, New Life, New Dangers After being reborn on YouTube as The Museum of Classic Chicago Television (MCCTv), the last sixteen years have been quite a ride. Over 80 million views later, MCCTv is a much-loved 501(c)(3) non-profit Illinois corporation but in just 48 hours, may simply cease to exist. In a series of emails starting Friday and continuing over the weekend, Klein began by explaining his team’s predicament, one that TorrentFreak has heard time and again over the past few years. Acting on behalf of a copyright owner, in this case Sony, India-based anti-piracy company Markscan hit the MCCTv channel with a flurry of copyright claims. If these cannot be resolved, the entire project may disappear. Time Running Out Issuing copyright notices is core work for many anti-piracy companies. The problem for Klein and many others before him is that while YouTube suggests that disputes can be discussed with Markscan, an abundance of online reports beg to differ. No matter whether takedowns are justified, unjustified (Markscan hit Sony’s own website with a DMCA takedown recently), or simply disputed, getting Markscan’s attention is a lottery at best, impossible at worst. In MCCTv’s short experience, nothing has changed. “Our YouTube channel with 150k subscribers is in danger of being terminated by September 6th if I don’t find a way to resolve these copyright claims that Markscan made,” Klein told TorrentFreak on Friday. “At this point, I don’t even care if they were issued under authorization by Sony or not – I just need to reach a live human being to try to resolve this without copyright strikes. I am willing to remove the material manually to get the strikes reversed.” Complaints Targeted TV Shows 40 to 60 years old Over the weekend Klein shared details of the copyright complaints filed with YouTube. Two of the claims can be seen in the image below and on first view, appear straightforward enough. Two episodes of the TV series Bewitched dated 1964 aired on ABC Network and almost sixty years later, archive copies of those transmissions were removed from YouTube for violating Sony copyrights, with MCCTv receiving a strike. A claim targeting an upload titled Bewitched – ‘Twitch or Treat’ – WPWR Channel 60 (Complete Broadcast, 8/6/1984) follows the same pattern, but what isn’t shown are the details added by MCCTv to place the episode (and the included commercials) in historical context. (S0307, originally aired over the ABC Network, and therefore in Chicago via then-WBKB Channel 7, on October 27th 1966) as seen via a slightly worn copy on WPWR Channel 60. This episode featured legendary San Francisco Giants center fielder Willie Mays, a.k.a. ‘The Say Hey Kid,’ as himself. Includes: Station ID (voiceover by Neal Sabin) Show opening titles (1966 copyright – this was Bewitched’s first season in color) Commercial: Crispy Wheats ‘n Raisins Episode Act I Commercials for: DeVry Institute of Technology Another takedown target – Bewitched – ‘Sam in the Moon’ (Complete 16mm Network Print, 1/5/1967) is accompanied by even more detail, including references in the episode to then-current events. In this installment, Samantha and Endora have traveled to Tokyo, and when Darrin asks where they’d been, Sam tells him shed been to the moon – and Darrin believes her. (Historical Note related to the moonshot race: This was broadcast 22 days prior to the fire on board Apollo 1 that killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee) Given that copyright law locks content down for decades, Klein understands that can sometimes cause issues, although 16 years on YouTube suggests that the overwhelming majority of rightsholders don’t consider his channel a threat. If they did, the option to monetize the recordings can be an option. No Competition For Commercial Offers Why most rightsholders have left MCCTv alone is hard to say; perhaps some see the historical value of the channel, maybe others don’t know it exists. At least in part, Klein believes the low quality of the videos could be significant. “These were relatively low picture quality broadcast examples from various channels from various years at least 30-40 years ago, with the original commercial breaks intact. Also mixed in with these were examples of ’16mm network prints’ which are surviving original film prints that were sent out to TV stations back in the day from when the show originally aired. In many cases they include original sponsorship notices, original network commercials, ‘In Color’ notices, etc.,” he explains. These oddities, none of which would ever find their way into a commercial product, are historically significant; where else can viewers soak up the past while relieving soaking their face with the Clairol Skin Machine? Unavailable elsewhere, these moments transform old TV broadcasts into entertaining history lessons, and Klein says that’s what people love about the channel. “Watching vintage broadcasts or network film prints with commercials is the closest we can get to time-travelling through a TV or computer screen. Here is an actual recording, made in real time, at a specific moment in time, in a particular city, in the past – and you get to peek in through your time portal. That’s the appeal,” he says. An Opportunity to Put Things Right Klein says MCCTv certainly doesn’t set out to hurt copyright holders. However, there’s always a balance between preserving “rare pieces of video ephemera” and the likelihood that nobody needs to enforce any rights, versus unusual circumstances like these where unexpected complaints need to be resolved with impossible-to-reach parties. Klein says the team is happy to comply with Sony’s wishes and they hope that given a little leeway, the project won’t be consigned to history. Perhaps Sony will recall the importance of time-shifting while understanding that time itself is running out for The Museum of Classic Chicago Television.

Doesn&#x27;t preservation usually mean not destroying the works with tacky advertisements that can&#x27;t be removed without permanently altering the original content?I consume (and share) a lot of old video and I don&#x27;t see this as a big loss since you can&#x27;t enjoy the original works as they were intended to be. reply throwaway_ab 21 hours agoparentExactly my thoughts.I had a look at the channel and wondered why there was no true archival version provided by either:1. The channel org itself via \"Internet Archive\" and&#x2F;or torrents.2. The community. It is trivial to create archival copies of youtube channels and most rare true archival footage on youtube will be mirrored elsewhere, even if \"illegally\".(1) does not exist and (2) is non existent either, no one considers these encodes valuable enough to preserve, which does seem odd considering it is unique data.Load up the videos, and you see a giant watermark, thus destroying any archival usage.No one will fight for this channnel, no one will bother mirroring it, because every encode is ruined and flawed.If the channel&#x2F;org has the originals, consider talking to Internet Archive reply saurik 19 hours agorootparentOh come on... I read these comments and was thinking I&#x27;d see something ridiculously large--maybe even taking up a third of the video--not something that&#x27;s only like a tenth the vertical space. Yes: it would be better to not have it, but a lot of TV stations had watermarks on TV shows at the time! This isn&#x27;t that large, I can see through it, and the audio is (of course) fine.The reason no one is mirroring these things isn&#x27;t because of the watermarks: it is because all of this content was already just ephemera that most people consider trash in the first place. Hell: I care a lot about this stuff... but do I want to personally spend the money to carry it around forever? This is a lot of content that I will never personally watch much of. But is that because of the URL watermark? No.(edit: Oh god... I started watching some of this stuff and realized it isn&#x27;t just commercials but local Chicago news reporting on important historical topics and now I am in fact frantically archiving parts of the channel, though I am definitely doing so selectively; but like, they clearly themselves were uploading somewhat selectively, so the hit rate is higher than I had initially hoped even though it is still certainly a small fraction of the channel.) reply justin66 18 hours agorootparentThe watermarks signify that these are trash, and the real copies are archived elsewhere. That’s why nobody is rushing to mirror them: it’s inconceivable that anyone would go to the trouble of making these and not preserve the non watermarked versions. reply saurik 17 hours agorootparentAnd are they going to upload it somewhere we can find it easily later? I dunno: I ended up hand selecting just over 200 of these videos that I&#x27;d be sad to not have access to later, and am downloading them (almost half of those are going to take me hours to finish) so I have a copy. reply justin66 15 hours agorootparentI do think that&#x27;s a reasonable thing to do. Higher quality copies almost certainly exist but too much of digital archiving is fragile in the sense that someone might have taken all the precautions and... that single person might just pass away at some point. reply mopenstein 19 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not high art, I&#x27;ll concede that point, but it has some value in its unaltered state. There&#x27;s been countless times I was looking for something only to have my hopes dashed because it was being made available from this channel alone. I&#x27;ll also concede I&#x27;m not the average consumer of entertainment. But if this stuff isn&#x27;t for people like me, then who? If no one cares, why produce it all? If all it does is frustrate the people that do care, why produce it all?Watermarks have their place, if you&#x27;re the original creator, but to take works from others and slap your ad on it is pretty despicable (relatively). reply saurik 17 hours agorootparentSure: I am not defending that they added the watermark, and agree that that sucks (and would even accept \"despicable\" as a good adjective to describe it)... I am merely defending that, if the only copy I have access to has a watermark, it has effectively zero impact on any use case I can fathom for the video. reply fennecfoxy 1 hour agorootparentprevLmao. Okay, every channel mirroring it adds their own watermark in a different spot. 10 years later it had a dozen watermarks.It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve not been on the internet...never seen an imgflip&ifunny&etc&etc branded meme? reply interestica 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;d probably be best if it were a dedicate logo screen before the content. The content remains unaltered. reply oefrha 18 hours agorootparentprevTV station watermarks are usually a lot less intrusive than this www.fuzzymemories.tv wordmark (URL-mark?), and logos are arguably timeless compared to URLs — this one seems to be dead already, says “External Error” when I visit. reply RF_Enthusiast 11 hours agorootparentTo me, the TV station&#x2F;network watermarks from the original broadcasts are actually part of the history. reply LocalH 6 hours agoparentprevFew people who upload old video to YouTube have any clue what they’re doing, and even without the watermark, these videos were most likely not archive-quality.

As in, you can&#x27;t watch it twice \"for the first time\", and the first time is always special. reply criddell 15 hours agorootparentprevI also feel a little sad whenever I hear somebody describe themselves as a content creator. They are giving in to the idea that their work exists just to sandwich ads around in somebody else’s CMS. reply julianeon 14 hours agorootparentActually I think if you put your comment and the parent comment together, you can see why they use that term. Because the alternative to the phrase “content creator”, for a single online person, might be: I am a YouTube video creator; an X tweet, photograph and video creator; an Instagram post, photo and video creator; also an ebook writer… obviously this gets unwieldy fast. “Content creator” conveniently covers it all. What I think using “read&#x2F;write&#x2F;record” misses, is that the format is not materially important, when the important thing is your audience. reply julianeon 14 hours agorootparentprevActually I think if you put your comment and the parent comment together, you can see why they use that term.

And I understand when marketers use it in their business internally. When the person says I consume in relation to say watching a move as in this case, reading a book etc. it is different in my opinion. reply loloquwowndueo 18 hours agorootparentprevMod parent up! reply Moggie100 22 hours agoprevThe title here might be hyperbole, but if shutting down a channel would make the museum ‘die’ then they’re simply not preserving the data properly.I’m not sure why folks seem to think that Youtube is a good place to archive anything - sure its a good distribution system, but time and time again we see that a handful of malicious actors can shut down entire channels with relative ease.I would hope that these videos are backed up somewhere else on any of the many bulk cloud storage providers out there B2, AWS, Google cloud storage, etc. etc. etc. and could, with some effort be made available elsewhere than Youtube, or restored to the platform after the current storm dies down. reply YurgenJurgensen 22 hours agoparentA museum that nobody can access is just a warehouse. reply Moggie100 22 hours agorootparentTrue enough, but even physical museums have warehouses where the artefacts are safely preserved between viewings.Analogies aside, I’m not against anyone using Youtube (or any other platform) for distribution - just that it absolutely should not be also used for your actual archive. There are much, much safer and better systems for that.Replicate to preserve! reply s0rce 17 hours agorootparentThose often support researchers and aren&#x27;t just warehouses but it is a bit disappointing how much of the really neat stuff you can&#x27;t see without special access. I really enjoy seeing rock and mineral collections and got a tour of the Royal Ontario Museum collection from a research collaborator when I was in Toronto and it was so cool to see. reply Inhibit 19 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s generally the case with most museums. Only a fraction have physical displays.The idea is that the \"stuff\" is archived or stored properly which is much less of a burden. When it&#x27;s desirable to do so public displays of it can be created. reply wl 21 hours agorootparentprevMost museums display only a fraction of their holdings at any given time. reply cwillu 21 hours agorootparentBecause of limitations on physical space. reply jebarker 20 hours agorootparentI think curation is inherently valued too. reply Dylan16807 16 hours agorootparentWith a TV show, I would expect the curation to involve exhibits about it. Summaries, context, interviews, etc. The actual episodes should be easy to access and not in cold storage. reply jebarker 16 hours agorootparentIn the TV show case I think curation means highlighting notable content and grouping together similar content (for various definitions of similar). I suppose the algorithms attempt to do this but are generally bad compared to human curation. I agree that it makes no sense to have all content available underneath this curation though. reply hgsgm 19 hours agorootparentprevAnd if the full collection is on display, more people can curate reply s0rce 17 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t curation imply the full collection is not on display? I guess it depends on the definition you use. reply edgyquant 16 hours agorootparentprevDon’t think you’re understanding what curate means in this context replytoomuchtodo 21 hours agorootparentprevA museum acting as a warehouse is preserving the past for the future, when what they’ve archived can be made publicly available again. reply dalbasal 16 hours agorootparentprevMuseum, often, are 90% warehouse.The idea that museums should have exhibitions and be open to the public was a later development. reply Dalewyn 20 hours agorootparentprevNobody can prohibit the preservation, that is to say archiving, of copyrighted works. This right is protected by the law, at least in the US which is relevant here.What is prohibited by law is distribution of copyrighted works. You need permission or an appropriate license from the rightsholders concerned to distribute or otherwise perform a copyrighted work in public.It is nearly always the latter that a lot of these so-called \"archives\" trip over. Everyone, including Big Corp, is fine with having their copyrighted works preserved.Obligatory IANAL. reply crote 16 hours agorootparentBig Corp is absolutely not fine with having their work preserved. See for example the Disney Vault and the recent move to create modern adaptations rather than doing reruns of classics. They are terrified of their works entering public domain and want you to forget they ever existed at all and just pay your monthly streaming fee. reply Dalewyn 11 hours agorootparentPreservation and archiving can be done regardless of copyright status. Disney wants to renew their copyright because they don&#x27;t want their stuff distributed. reply squarefoot 20 hours agorootparentprevDistributed p2p is a thing. reply 3np 22 hours agoparentprevQuality deterioration is another.

Trying to defend the legality of hundreds of hours of variety TV is a Fair Use suicide mission, even if you&#x27;ve got Apple or Tesla lawyers. There&#x27;s probably thousands of legally legitimate copyright claims to be made distributing footage like that. The value in defending it is marginal, especially for a business like YouTube.> Don&#x27;t play their game.I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to play their game. Alas, here we are rolling our dice again because hosted video platforms don&#x27;t work without finding someone to host it. reply jacobwilliamroy 21 hours agoparentprevMost people don&#x27;t want to deal with data. So the idea that someone else will deal with the data is attractive to most people. It&#x27;s as simple as that really. I used to work at a non-profit and we dealt with a lot of video and we spent a lot of time keeping that stuff organized and preventing data corruption. reply ta1243 21 hours agoprev\"Two episodes of the TV series Bewitched dated 1964 aired on ABC Network and almost sixty years later, archive copies of those transmissions were removed from YouTube for violating Sony copyrights, with MCCTv receiving a strike\"Well you can argue that copyright shouldn&#x27;t last 60 years, and I&#x27;d agree, but it does.Just because you don&#x27;t like the law, it doesn&#x27;t mean you can break it without consequences. reply crazygringo 16 hours agoparentYeah, and Bewitched seems like a terrible example.

This is not a bad-faith jab, I&#x27;m really curious. Laws are not absolute and there is no requirement to uphold it if either the judge or the jury thinks it&#x27;s not reasonable. (Exceptions include minimum sentencing laws, AFAIK.) reply wongarsu 20 hours agorootparentEven with minimum sentences, if the President and Governor instruct police to ignore all violations of a law, you can treat it as if it didn&#x27;t exist. Or police officers can decide that the punishment is so low that enforcing a law isn&#x27;t worth their time (see e.g. California&#x27;s shoplifting misdemeanor).But all of these are examples of other people disliking a law. If the right other people dislike a law, you can ignore it. But whether you like it doesn&#x27;t really play into it. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentThe executive&#x27;s opportunity to squash a law is his veto power. Once the law is on the books, the executive branch is duty-bound to enforce it, as it represents the will of the people via their elected representatives.If executives can just decide which laws to enforce and which to ignore then we&#x27;re partway down the road to dictatorship.

Jury nullification is possible in a criminal context because once the defendant has been acquitted, and regardless of why he was acquitted, he cannot be tried again for the same offense. A consideration of the constitutionality of civil jury nullification is beyond the scope of this Note. See generally Lars Noah, Civil Jury Nullification, 86 Iowa L.

Can you name any examples that anyone except lawyers &#x2F; judges would know? reply throwaway17_17 19 hours agorootparentJury nullification is where a jury ‘nullifies’ a legally correct verdict in a trial by voting against it for other reasons. In my line of work, the most frequently cited instances of jury nullification was the 10 juror requirement for a verdict in the State of Louisiana. The reduced requirement (from most jurisdictions 12 unanimous jurors) was instituted explicitly to allow for ‘white’ criminal defendants to be acquitted of crimes against African-American. Following reconstruction, the jury needed to appear like it could have racially diverse individuals serve on it, so they lowered the requirement for the number of agreeing jurors required so if two African-Americans actually made it on the jury their votes would not count.The typical historical ‘example’ would be the jury finding a ‘white’ defendant not guilty of a clearly proven crime (murder, rape, battery, etc.)A more modern example would be a jury finding a defendant not guilty of possession of marijuana even though the defendant obviously had MJ in their possession. reply hedora 14 hours agorootparentOther modern examples include Musk’s stock manipulation trial, and jurors refusing to convict in cases where police use excessive force. reply ndsipa_pomu 15 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s some on the Wikipedia pagee.g.> In 2021, six activists associated with the environmental protest organisation Extinction Rebellion were tried for causing criminal damage to the British headquarters of the multinational oil company Royal Dutch Shell.

Got an automatic flag on an work composed, performed, recorded, and released by the Air Force Band of the Pacific.Turns out someone was re-selling it on media and the label had auto-filed all their holdings. So you&#x27;d get flagged on every usage.The sergeant in charge of the correspondence for the band was annoyed but as YouTube is private there honestly wasn&#x27;t anything they could do (other than write me a polite response to send on that I was correct). I did make them aware of it in the unlikely event someone else asks, though.Annoyingly enough YouTube doesn&#x27;t take down the automatic match even when it&#x27;s a false claim from what I saw. reply TekMol 19 hours agoprevWhy is YouTube needed for this project?Why not just put all those videos on a webserver? reply porkbeer 19 hours agoparentCost. reply prirun 18 hours agoprevI would review this link about disputing the DMCA copyright claims against your museum:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;intellectual-property&#x2F;guide-to-yo...IANAL, but IMO, you have several points in your favor to argue that yours is \"fair use\":1. You&#x27;re not (I presume) making money from it2. Part of it is news, which is more likely to be fair use than creative works.3. The content is old and the quality is poor compared to today&#x27;s standards.4. The current market value of the content is not very high. It&#x27;s not like you are publishing the upcoming Dune sequel. Current market value and whether you are taking away money from the copyright owner are considerations in determining fair use.If you are actually setup as a museum or online library, I would think that would bolster your case even further that this is fair use.As I said, I am not a lawyer and this is only my opinion. However, I do think people are much too quick to cave on these automated DMCA takedowns. If you do dispute it, what&#x27;s the likelihood this Indian company or Sony is going to sue you? Whether you are willing to take that risk is of course your decision, but their entire operation would fall apart if everyone disputed their claims. It only works because everyone caves immediately. reply mod50ack 17 hours agoparent(Also not a lawyer and not giving any legal advice here.)Some of the points may be true, but it is virtually impossible that these uses are fair.Here are some reasons:1. While the content may be old, and the production quality may not be considered high by today&#x27;s viewers, these factors are not really relevant. The quality of the reproduction of the works, meanwhile, is good enough that they can be effectively viewed; while these may be less marketable than a copy made from a master, this is more than faithful enough to serve as a market replacement for the original (and thus infringes).2. The current overall market value of the works is irrelevant. The question in an infringement suit is not whether or not there is a market for the work; it is whether or not whatever value the work could have is affected by the re-used version being used as a replacement. A popular work may have a greater market value than an unpopular one, but copyright law does not protect works based on popularity. Even if the actual market value of the original is near zero anyway, this does not make giving away free copies a fair use (since that destroys whatever market value the original could have).3. The work has not been transformed in any way. The reproduction is faithful (to the extent this was technologically possible). The copies tend to be of the entire work. The purpose of the work (display for viewing) is the same as the original purpose; there is no transformation.The channel here is reproducing the original works in their entirety. These copies serve as a good substitute for any copies the original copyright holder could be making and selling&#x2F;licensing. This boils down to the question: do these copies fulfill any demand there might be for the originals? The answer is yes. This is not fair use.The question of whether or not a copyright holder strictly enforces the copyrights — in many cases, they don&#x27;t — isn&#x27;t relevant; they remain valid.Now, for a lot of people, this seems unfair. The original works are often not available on the market. A lot of people think that non-marketed works should be able to be copied by non-profits for the public&#x27;s use. But that&#x27;s not something the law allows. reply edgarvaldes 13 hours agoprevI dream of the day when the archiving of the web is no longer a problem: bandwith, storage, tagging, search, etc. All the videos, all the tutorials, all the books, everything archived and retrievable for posterity. reply yaur 17 hours agoprevIs this MBC[1] or a different Chicago based classic tv museum?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.museum.tv&#x2F; reply chiefalchemist 21 hours agoprevIsn&#x27;t part of the copyright law that companies must defend their right in the short-term, else it&#x27;s effectively forfeiting the protection in the future?

Corporations are the most obvious one because corporations are made of people but do not actually act like regular people. If you put a black box around most corporations and someone asked you what was in it, you’d say the box contained a sociopath.I am not moralizing here, by the way. I am not claiming that corporations should be less sociopathic. Maybe they should be but we’ve had much better success in aligning sociopathy than in making the amoral, moral - see capitalism vs communism - so I think it’s an open question.Another group of entities which, while comprised of people, does not act in the way you’ve come to understand a human to act is politicians. The incentives to act in whatever way that is most effective totally dominates their behavior.

    "originBody": "updated....April 26, 1999 Visit Judy Sammel's Homepage: www.pobox.com/~sammel Get a Cable Modem......Go to Jail I've just been through a truly bizarre experience with Comcast@home, and I thought the assembled readership might be interested in hearing about it. Chapter 1: In Which I Learn About the Various Divisions of the District Court of the State of Maryland Thursday, November 19, 1998: It's an ordinary day. I get home from work, picking up the mail as I walk toward my house. I notice that the return address on one of the letters is the District Court of the State of Maryland. As I walk up the front steps, I think, \"I just did jury duty last year; they can't be asking me to serve again so soon, can they?\" After I settle in at home, I open the letter and read, \"You have been summoned to appear as a defendant in a trial...\" My first thought is that someone is suing me for something, but then I see at the top of the page 'State of Maryland vs. Sammel, Judith Lynne', and realize that this isn't a person suing me. My second thought is that I've gotten a parking ticket that blew off of my windshield and has gone unpaid, or maybe a speeding ticket from the traffic cameras I've heard about. It's too late to call the Court to see what the case is about, so I have to wait until the next day. The next morning, I call the telephone number that's printed on the letter, and a recording says something like \"press 1 for Civil Division, 2 for Traffic Division, 3 for Criminal Division, 4 for information about specific cases,\" etc. I choose the option for information about specific cases, and the person who answers the phone asks me to read her the case number. After I read it, I hear her say, \"Just a minute. Let me transfer you to the Criminal Division.\" \"Whaaaaaaaaat?\" I ask, but it's too late. I'm on hold. Someone else picks up the phone, and again I read the case number and ask what the case is about. \"Cable fraud, \" she replies. Chapter 2: In Which Comcast Cablevision's Administrative Offices in Baltimore are Informed that \"At Home\" is More Than Just \"A Place They'd Rather Be Than At The Office\" Unfortunately, I think I know what the problem is. I had signed up for Comcast@home cable modem service last March, but had not signed up for cable TV service. (Last time I checked, this was legal. In fact, it is mentioned specifically as a service in the FAQ list on @home's web site.) But, when they came to install my @home service, they had neglected to install the filter (they call it a video trap) to filter out the video signal from reaching my home. (I live in a townhouse community, and there is a \"pedestal\" containing cable connections for several houses--this is a few houses away from mine.) The installers had told me that they would return to install the video trap, and that I could enjoy cable TV service until they came back to do so--they said I should consider it an incentive to sign up for the service. Well, they never came back to install the video trap. Then, in early June, my @home service stopped working. I made several calls to Comcast Cablevision and Comcast@home customer service. Each claimed that it was the responsibility of the other to determine what the problem was, and fix it. During my conversations with Comcast Cablevision and Comcast@home, I told them both that nobody had come back to install the video trap. Finally, Comcast@home agreed to come out and see what the problem was. I told them that they should bring a video trap with them when they came to repair the service. Because of their schedule and my vacation schedule, they didn't come out to repair the service until late June. The repair technician, when he arrived, said that the reason that my @home service stopped working was that someone had disconnected the cable in the cable \"pedestal\" on my street. He said that it was likely that Comcast Cablevision personnel had done this, not realizing that I had Comcast@home service. When he'd reconnected my service, I asked him about the installation of the video trap. He said he hadn't brought one with him, but would take care of it later. Again, nobody came back to install the device. So, after I receive this letter from the District Court, I figure that Comcast Cablevision has been out to my neighborhood and has seen that I was connected up again (and again not realized that I had Comcast@home cable modem service.) I call the administrative offices of Comcast Cablevision here in Baltimore, and explain the situation. They say that they will have Comcast's attorneys call me to discuss it. I also make the suggestion that they come out and install a video trap on my line so that this won't happen again. They assure me they will send someone out that day to do it. I get home fairly late that evening and find that the video trap hasn't been installed. Since the Comcast administrative offices are closed by this time, I call @home customer service. I call at 10:30 PM and remain on hold until 11:15 PM, at which time a customer service representative takes the call. When I ask about getting a video trap placed on the line, his first response is that Comcast, not @home, should take care of that, and I should call Comcast customer service. I explain to him that, based on my prior experience with Comcast customer service, if I call them, the following situation will likely occur: the Comcast customer service representative will ask for my Comcast account number I will reply that I have none, since I am only a Comcast@home customer, not a Comcast cable TV customer the service representative will tell me they can't do anything for me, and I will have to call @home customer service He then agrees to talk to his supervisor. He returns to the line to tell me that he will place a work order for a video trap to be placed on the line. Chapter 3: In Which I Wait Not-So-Patiently for Comcast's Attorney to Call, and for the Video Trap to be Installed Saturday, November 21, 1998: After I place two calls to their offices, Comcast's attorney who is assigned to my case returns my call to assure me that the criminal charges will be dropped. I mention that the video trap wasn't installed the previous day. Sunday, November 22, 1998: As of Sunday morning, neither Comcast nor @home has arrived to place a video trap on the line. I call Comcast customer service to ask about the status of this, and am initially told that since I am not a Comcast cable TV customer, I have to call @home to resolve any problems. I explain that the situation is related to criminal charges that Comcast has filed against me, and ask the account executive to try to find a way to assist me from her location. She asks for my name and address. I give it to her, and she comes back on the line after a few moments and says that the only name she has listed at that address is that of former occupants of my home (from1989-1992). I explain again that I am not a Comcast cable TV customer, but only a Comcast@home customer, so there would likely not be a record of my name, unless she has records of Comcast@home customers as well as Comcast cable TV customers. She again asks me to hold the line. When she returns, she says that she has checked into the situation with @home, and has found out that the video trap was not placed on the line because the part is out of stock. She says that when parts are shipped, they will send an installer out to put it in. She says that in the meantime, I cannot be held responsible for the signal coming into my home. Tuesday, November 24, 1998: Comcast's attorney leaves a message on my answering machine saying: \"I withdrew...did a request to withdraw those charging documents\" . I will soon find out the hard way that the \"withdrew...did a request to withdraw\" wording actually means something--Comcast doesn't have the ability to get criminal charges dropped on their own, even though they're the ones who got the court to file them in the first place. Once the charges are \"in the system\", Comcast can only request that this be done. Chapter 4: In Which A Police Officer Serves Me With A Criminal Summons in Front of an Out-of-Town Houseguest on the Eve of Thanksgiving Wednesday, November 25, 1998: A uniformed police officer drives up to my house in his police cruiser and delivers the summons to me; it shows 4 counts of cable fraud, with the possibility of 6 months in jail on each count. I had always wondered why, when someone commits what appears to be a single crime, you hear things about being charged with \"10 counts\" of something-or-other. In my case, Comcast's visit in June (when they cut off my service) was 2 counts--one for cable having been fraudulently hooked up, one for fraudulent receipt of service; and a subsequent visit they made in July, during which they saw that service had been reconnected, was again 2 counts. I try to tell the police officer what Comcast's attorney has told me to tell him--that the charges are being dropped, and that he should call her to verify this--but he could care less about this--he just wants a signature on the papers and wants to leave. A friend of mine, who has driven up from Virginia to spend the holiday weekend with me, is sitting nearby in my kitchen watching this sorry event; it's a really humiliating experience. Anyway, by the end of the day, I find that the video trap has finally been installed on the line. Chapter 5: In Which I Come to the Conclusion that Lady Justice is Not Just Blindfolded, But Actually Blind Monday, November 30, 1998: I telephone the State's Attorney's office to see if they have received and processed Comcast's request to withdraw the charges. They tell me that it has been received, and that the State's Attorney's office has disapproved Comcast's request. They tell me that no reason for the disapproval was supplied. I begin to feel like a character in a Kafka novel. I call Comcast's administrative offices in Baltimore and tell them that the State's Attorney has denied the request to withdraw charges. \"They can't do that!\" the employee that I speak to exclaims. \"Well, obviously they can, because...they have,\" I reply. Chapter 6: In Which I Determine That an Excellent Way to Pique Someone's Curiosity is to Ask, \"Do You Have any Recommendations for a Good Criminal Defense Attorney?\" No chapter here, but it's too good of a title to pass up. Actually, I am told by some colleagues who are attorneys that even in a cut-and-dried case like this, I should expect to pay $750 or $1000 for an attorney if I need to mount a defense in court. Chapter 7: In Which I Find Out that the Attorney for Comcast Actually Does Have a Sense of Humor I speak with the Comcast attorney about my call to State's Attorney's office. She says she was unaware that State's Attorney has denied the request to drop the charges, and that she will write another letter to ensure that the situation is taken care of. She also asks about whether the video trap has been installed and is working correctly. I tell her that everything is blocked except for 2 religious channels, 1 Spanish language channel, and the video portion of E! TV. She says something along the lines of, \"I guess the signal of the Lord manages to find its way through somehow.\" Chapter 8: In Which I Learn That the Cable TV Franchising Authority is Willing to Handle Complaints About Cable TV Issues--But Only Up To a Point A friend of mine had suggested that I find out who the Franchising Authority for cable television in Baltimore County is, and that I ask them to assist in the getting the problem resolved. I find out that the Baltimore County Council is the local Franchising Authority. On November 30, I call the County Council's offices and speak to an employee who is assigned to handle cable television issues. I explain the situation; she says she will check into it. On December 1, I speak to her again, and she says she had gotten in touch with the Assistant to the VP at Comcast Cablevision of Baltimore, and he will call her back with information. On December 3, when I speak to her again, she says that the assistant to the VP had assured her that Comcast is working on the problem. She is satisfied with this answer, and encourages me to \"call her back to let her know when the problem's been resolved\". It's nice to know that the employees of our local elected officials are really concerned about taking such a proactive role in ensuring that the problems of constituents are handled effectively. Chapter 9: Boy, Do I Feel Like A Criminal Thursday, December 3, 1998: One of the other Comcast attorneys calls me to say that the only person at the State's Attorney's office who can take care of the situation is an Assistant State's Attorney who is the Chief of the District Court Division, and that he has been out of the office all week. The attorney gives me the phone number, and tells me I can try to reach him myself. I call the number a few times during the day, and am alternately told that he is out of the office, or that \"you're not allowed to call the State's Attorney, you're a defendant!\". I leave a message for him, but it is not returned. Also, around this time, I have a bizarre discussion with the Comcast attorney to try to find out why the State's Attorney disapproved the request to withdraw the charges. She explains that procedurally, they cannot withdraw the charges once the trial date has been set, and the summons has been served. She tells me that I should have \"avoided being served\". I never thought I'd ever get myself into a situation where I had to make a point of avoiding process servers. Anyway, it's true that the trial date had already been set (it was set on the same day Comcast applied for the Statement of Charges, November 17, 1998). But, the summons was not served to me until Wednesday, November 25. The State's Attorney disapproved the request for withdrawal of the charges on Tuesday, November 24, the day before I was served. So, either the State's Attorney's office doesn't know its own procedures, doesn't bother to follow them, or perhaps there's something more nefarious going on; I'm still not sure. Chapter 10: In Which I Get To Speak With Sandra O'Connor's Second-In-Command Friday, December 4, 1998: No, not that Sandra O'Connor. Baltimore County has its own, local, Sandra O'Connor. She's the State's Attorney (an elected official) and I've actually voted for her. I speak with her Deputy for Operations. Since he's responsible for the overseeing the District Court Division, he's the one that the Chief of the District Court Division reports to. I explain that Comcast said that the Chief of the District Court Division was the only one who could take care of the situation, but that he's been unavailable for several days. I ask the Deputy for Operations if he can take care of the situation in his employee's absence. He tells me no--that I should wait until his employee returns on the following Monday. He tells me that there is nothing in my file to show that Comcast has done anything related to the case since November 24, and that, if Comcast has promised to get the charges dismissed, I should be \"on them\" to take care of it. Chapter 11: In Which I Get to Sit and Stew About This for Another Weekend Because the Only Person on Earth Who Can Apparently Take Care of this Situation is Either in Training, on Vacation, or Simply Out of the Office, Depending Upon Whom You Talk To December 5-6, 1998: My demeanor begins to degrade into \"don't get mad, get even\" mode. I do some research on what the elements of a case of malicious prosecution are. (And, of course, I can do all of my research over the Internet--at cable modem speeds.) Paraphrasing one article that I read, the elements are: 1. The people that you sue for malicious prosecution have to be the one that got charges filed against you in the first place. 2. The case has to have been decided in your favor, in one way or another. 3. There has to have been a lack of probable cause. 4. There has to have been malice. 5. There have to be damages. Although \"malice\" in this situation might be hard to prove, one article published on the subject asserts that malice can be implied from a lack of probable cause, and from inadequate investigation and research. \"Lack of probable cause\" might also be difficult to prove here, but I believe that a good lawyer could argue that the fact that \"cables have been connected and Comcast Cablevision was not the one who connected them\" is no longer acceptable as probable cause, now that Comcast Cablevision has given @home (or its local affiliate, Comcast Online Communications) the authority to connect them. Chapter 12: Things Finally Start Falling Into Place December 7, 1998: I leave a voice mail message for the General Counsel at Comcast's Corporate Headquarters in Philadelphia telling him I'm unhappy with the way the situation is being handled, and that I'm considering filing a case in civil court for malicious prosecution. I receive a conciliatory call back from him, and also from one of the local Comcast attorneys telling me that the situation is being taken care of promptly. I finally get a call from the Chief of the District Court Division of the State's Attorney's office saying they will \"nol pros\" the case. It's great; I'm getting to learn some Latin while I'm at it. \"Nol pros\" is short for \"nolle prosequi\", which is Latin for \"I will not prosecute.\" I can't believe it's taken over two weeks just to get a verbal agreement from the State's Attorney not to prosecute a case that everyone involved clearly agrees was based on a Comcast error. December 12, 1998: I receive a courtesy copy of a letter from the State's Attorney to the Judge, requesting that the trial date be moved up, and saying that they intend to nol pros. December 22, 1998: I call the District Court, and find out that the Judge has moved the trial date up to January 12, 1999, instead of the original date, which was in March 1999. Chapter 13: In Which I Get an Unsolicited Letter From a Local Criminal Defense Attorney December 30, 1998: I come home from work to find another interesting letter in my mailbox; this time it's from a local criminal defense attorney. It reads, \"Dear Ms. Sammel, When you are charged with a criminal offense, not only can your freedom and liberty be taken away, a criminal record can affect you the rest of your life.\" The attorney then proceeds to offer his services, and even provides me with a handy little reminder card with my trial date stamped on it. Great. I guess that since the court's records are considered public documents, anyone can come in and get copies of them. I'm afraid to think about what kinds of mailing lists I could end up on as a result of this. Will I start receiving notices asking me if I want to subscribe to Prison Life magazine? Chapter 14: In Which I Go to the Trial \"Just In Case\" Although I've been told by Comcast that I don't need to show up in court on the trial date, I've never received notice from the District Court about this. And, considering that the last paperwork I received from the court said \"a warrant for your arrest may be issued\" if you don't show up at your trial, I decide it would be best to show up anyway. January 12, 1999: Just when I'm starting to think that Comcast's motto has been morphed into \"Comcast--Everything You Convict With\", the court appearance is pretty uneventful. I show up at 8:30 along with about a dozen other people who are involved in other cases in the same courtroom that morning. According to the list outside the courtroom, it looks like there are a couple of theft cases and a couple of drug cases on the schedule. I'm actually starting to look forward to an interesting morning in court, hearing about all of this stuff, but the State's Attorney calls my case first. I start walking up to the Defendant's table, and hear the State's Attorney say that he's entering a nol pros. I've just reached the table when the judge says, \"your case is dismissed, you're free to go,\" and so I turn back around and leave the courtroom. Chapter 15: In Which The Assembled Readership Gets To Find Out That I Never Got Sent To Jail, But Just Got Threatened With The Possibility Of It Sorry to disappoint those of you who were looking forward to hearing about that part. I gave the \"malicious prosecution\" scenario a thought, but I'm not really a lawsuit kind of person. Unless I find out that Comcast has been involved in a pattern of cases like these without regard to the consequences, I don't intend to follow up on filing a malicious prosecution lawsuit. Besides, if I want to get my criminal record expunged, it looks like I will need to sign a waiver absolving them of liability for this incident. I am hoping, however, that Comcast will reimburse me for the $30 fee involved in getting my record expunged. Epilogue: Although everyone I dealt with seemed apologetic, and willing to help get this fairly outrageous situation taken care of, I believe that there are still some problems that Comcast and @Home management need to address. For that reason, I decided to write to the Presidents of both companies, and ask them to respond to several issues. A copy of the letter is below:[address deleted]January 13, 1999 Brian L. Roberts President, Comcast Corporation 1500 Market Street Philadelphia PA 19102 Thomas A. Jermoluk President, @Home Network 425 Broadway Street Redwood City, CA 94063 Dear Messrs. Roberts and Jermoluk: I am a Comcast@home cable modem subscriber (sammel@home.com) who is not concurrently a subscriber of Comcast cable television. Because of what I believe to be insufficient action by each of your companies, and insufficient coordination between them, I was recently criminally charged with cable fraud in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County (\"State of Maryland vs. Sammel, Judith Lynne\", case number 5C00097816). I was charged because: @Home installation and repair technicians failed to install protective measures to block out the cable television signal when both installing and repairing my cable modem service, and failed to mark the connection inside the cable \"pedestal\" that serves my home to indicate that it was a valid @Home connection; and, Comcast Cablevision did not bother to check the records of the @Home Network to see if I was a subscriber of cable modem service before filing an application for a criminal summons, after they saw that the cable wires serving my home were connected. Although, after a review of the facts of the situation, Comcast Cablevision convinced the State's Attorney to enter a \"nolle prosequi\" (a decision not to prosecute) in this case, I am requesting that both of your companies review their procedures for handling Comcast@home subscribers who are not concurrently Comcast cable television subscribers, to ensure that this situation does not happen to anyone else. I would appreciate if you would both respond to me concerning the following issues: What are the procedures used to mark the cable connections of non-cable-TV-subscriber customers of Comcast@home to ensure that Comcast technicians are aware that the connection is a valid Comcast@home connection? How do you assure that these procedures are being followed? Who is responsible for installing protective measures to block out the cable television signal on the lines of non-cable-TV-subscriber customers of Comcast@home, and how do you assure that these protective measures are being properly installed? I would like request that procedures be put in place, so that prior to submitting a request to any court of law to file criminal charges for cable fraud, Comcast Cablevision will check the records of the @Home Network to see if the individual to be charged is a valid customer of Comcast@home. I am also asking the Administrative Commissioner of the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County (who will be receiving a courtesy copy of this letter) to ensure that these procedures are followed prior to the issuing of any summons for cable fraud in our county. Perhaps the Court could require some type of affirmation that this check of @Home's customer records has been performed prior to determining that there is \"probable cause\" for a summons to be issued in any cable fraud case. I firmly believe that if Comcast Cablevision has given @Home technicians the authority to connect/modify cable connections, they also need to accept some responsibility for having done so, and not automatically assume that any lines that Comcast Cablevision has not connected themselves have been fraudulently connected by the homeowner. I would like to request that procedures be put in place by Comcast Cablevision customer support so that the records of non-cable-TV-subscriber customers of Comcast@home are available to them, and that they may be able to respond to customer service calls related to the physical cable connections of Comcast@home customers (instead of insisting that only @Home customer support can handle these requests.) I would like to request that procedures be put in place by both Comcast Cablevision and Comcast@home customer support, so that they are each fully aware of what their respective company's responsibilities are with regard to non-cable-TV-subscriber customers of Comcast@home. I would like to note that every Comcast Cablevision and Comcast@home customer service representative I have spoken with has been extremely courteous, has seemed knowledgeable, and has conscientiously attempted to assist me within the bounds of what their positions allowed them to do. This leads me to believe that the problem is more of a \"systemic\" one, that can only be addressed from a management level; this is why I am asking both of you to ensure that this never happens to anyone again. In addition, I am requesting an apology for the unfortunate situation which has occurred. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to inform me about how each of the issues listed above is being addressed. My mailing address and e-mail address are listed above, and my telephone numbers are [deleted].Sincerely,Judith L. Sammel cc: Joel Snyder, Administrative Commissioner, District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County The Honorable S.G. Samuel Moxley, Councilmember, Baltimore County Council (Franchising Authority for cable television in Baltimore County) Consumer Protection Division, Office of the Attorney General, State of Maryland Federal Communications Commission, Cable Services Bureau C. Lynne Silverman, Esquire, Ned S. Kodeck, Chartered (attorney for Comcast Cablevision of Maryland, LP) USENET newsgroups: athome.discussion-athomesvc, athome.discussion-general, athome.users-general, balt.general, rec.video.cable-tv, misc.legal Acknowledgments: Thanks very much to attorneys S.A., S.B. (and her colleague H.), C.E., R.G. and B.H., who provided me with assorted legal advice. (Although, I imagine that \"pro bono cable fraud work\" won't really add much substance to your résumés.) I'd also like to offer thanks to various friends and colleagues who assisted me with such useful comments as, \"we promise we'll visit you in jail,\" and to my 'unindicted coconspirator' S.R. for convincing me to get cable modem service in the first place. Update: 25 January 1999: I received a nice letter from Comcast's Baltimore Metro area Vice President, and the local General Manager of Comcast Online apologizing for these events, and outlining the steps they've taken to make sure this doesn't happen again. They now have a procedure to note @Home subscribers without cable TV service in their cable service billing system, and have added some checks and balances to ensure that their cable fraud investigators will be able to identify this type of situation in the future. This is a welcome change from the initial conversations I had with Comcast's attorney about this issue, where she insisted that no change in procedures was necessary, other than to ensure that the Comcast Online installers installed video traps in all installations where it's warranted. They graciously offered to pay the Court processing fees to get my record expunged, but I haven't gotten around to filling out the paperwork yet. Since the court told me that it can take up to 120 days for the paperwork to go through one it's filed, I'm not in such a great hurry anyway. 31 January 1999: The Multichannel News felt that this story was worth publishing in the February 1, 1999 edition of their magazine (on the front page, even!) They snarfed my title, too. They gave me permission to repost the articles on my web site: 'Get a Cable Modem...Go to Jail' and Sammel's Tale of @Jail . 2 February 1999: I got home from work and found two notes attached to my door. One was another letter of apology from the Baltimore Metro Area VP and the local Comcast Online General Manager, saying that they plan to extend my @home service for a year at no charge, along with a $50.00 gift certificate from Bibelot (my favorite bookstore!) The second was a handwritten note--they had apparently come by to deliver this in person, but I wasn't home. This is a very nice gesture; I appreciate it very much. Does it make me feel bad for having contacted Multichannel News? No; not at all--for two reasons: Although Comcast made every effort to get this taken care of after I contacted them about the summons back in November--the bottom line is that this never should have happened. There were people at Comcast who knew last June (at least) that the lack of communication between the cable TV folks and the cable modem folks was causing problems. It just never made it high enough on anyone's radar screen to do anything about it. I went to Multichannel News rather than a general-audience publication because I wanted to try to reach the folks at Shaw, Cox, TCI, Rogers, and Road Runner (and its associated cable partners) to get them thinking about whether the same problems could exist at their operations. 4 February 1999: I got a humorous surprise when I got home from work. I had asked Multichannel News if they could send me a copy of the print edition of their publication, and it arrived in today's mail. I found out that not only was my saga featured on the front page and the op-ed section, but there was a wonderful cartoon to go with it. 7 February 1999: Since Multichannel News updated their on-line edition, I changed the references for the articles they published about this case (see 31 January 1999 entry) to point to my reposts of their articles, instead. Also, since the print version of Mike Farrell's article in last week's edition had some text missing, they've reprinted the article in the February 8, 1999 print edition. All of the articles are searchable in Multichannel's archives available from their home page. 16 February 1999: It appears that \"Broadband Bob\" picked up my story and published a brief version to their mailing list, and on their web page. Also, a Brazilian has written an article in Portugese based on Mike Farrell's article in Multichannel News. I had a problem last Friday (February 12) with my cable modem service. Everything was proceeding at a snail's pace--mail, news, web-browsing. It continued for several hours, so I called to see if there was a problem in our area, or if they knew what might be wrong. They tried some troubleshooting (Tier 1 and Tier 2), and they said there was an RF problem with my connection, and they'd need to send someone out to look at it. The first time they had available was Monday (yesterday). They said \"9:00 AM with a 4 hour window\" for their arrival time. At 1:40 PM, a technician showed up. He did some testing at the cable modem (found a very weak signal), then at the connection where the cable enters my house (again, a weak signal), and then at the \"pedestal\" out on the street (again a weak signal--he said it was likely weak because there were two video traps on my line. I don't know this for sure, but I strongly suspect that the Comcast@home folks still had the \"order on the books\" for the video trap to be placed (see Chapter 3 above), and did not get the word that one had already been installed by Comcast Cablevision; so they came by to install another one. (So, not only don't the two organizations talk to each other, but they don't even recognize each other's handiwork?) So, he removed one of the video traps, and the signal started coming through strongly, and my service resumed immediately. I told him I wanted to make sure he didn't remove both video traps. He seemed curious why I was concerned about that, so I showed him the court documents, and told him I wanted to prevent a recurrence of the bizarre situation I found myself in last November. He said he couldn't believe that something like that had actually happened. (Join the crowd!) Keep the cards and letters (well...the e-mails) coming. One person has suggested that I post the titles of the books I purchased with the gift certificate Comcast gave me, in the hopes that I bought some books that were apropos to the issue at hand. Honestly, I hadn't thought of that when I was book shopping, so I didn't specifically look for books that might be pertinent (Is there a \"Malicious Prosecution for Dummies\" book out?) The books I got were: The Pillars of Hercules, by Paul Theroux (a travelogue of his trip through the Mediterranean); Getting A Life, by Blix/Heitmiller (financial and personal strategies for voluntary simplicity); The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Home Repair, by David Tenenbaum; and, The Argument Culture: Stopping America's War of Words, by Deborah Tannen (of You Just Don't Understand fame). Fairly boring--sorry to disappoint you. I mailed all the paperwork to the District Court to get my criminal record expunged. It included the \"General Waiver and Release\" which says that I release and discharge Comcast and the Baltimore County Police \"and any and all other persons\" for any claims I may have for wrongful conduct related to this incident. So, Comcast can rest easy about the legal aspect of all of this. 9 April 1999: I got an e-mail from Brian McWilliams at InternetNews, asking me to give an interview for InternetNews Radio. I called and spoke to him, and voila--a couple of hours later, there's a segment on my story in Real Audio format on InternetNews Radio. (© 1999 Internet.com Linked to with permission of Internet.com) 10 April 1999: There's a blurb about my saga in the current issue of Netsurfer Digest (Volume 05, Issue 11). 13 April 1999: My story is a \"Tasty Bit of the Day\" from Tasty Bits from the Technology Front. Lisa Ronthal at WorldNetDaily has a paragraph and a link to my site in her Interscope column. 16 April 1999: The Macintosh world has discovered the story, and links to it appear on Macaddict, Macresource, and MacInTouch. 25 April 1999: I received a copy of the expungement order, dated 14 April 1999. This means that the court has 30 days to serve the order on the Baltimore County Detention Center, The Baltimore County Police, the Msp-Cjis Repository (?) and the State's Attorney. They each then have 30 days to expunge their records, and provide a Certificate of Compliance back to the court, and to me. Now, if we can only expunge all records of my \"criminal activities\" from the Internet. :-) Someone has submitted my URL for the current issue (Vol. 20, Issue 33) of the Risks Digest which is available on the web, or on USENET as comp.risks .

I only handled cable modem installs and quit after a year to go major in philosophy and because:- Getting quietly threatened once (with AR-15 up against the customer&#x27;s front door) on a troubleshooting call that I wasn&#x27;t able to leave until \"the internet started working\".- Having to increasingly go do cable TV disconnects because people were usually in a bad way and I had more than one colleague that had either had a gun pulled on them or straight-up shot and left to die up a pole for most of a day while trying to disconnect cable.- Having to increasingly go on cable TV installs because people&#x27;s shitty TVs backfeeding electricity into the cable line meant I was getting zapped at least once a week.That said, I met a lot of cool people, gave out a lot of free TV&#x2F;HBO because I didn&#x27;t care unless the customer was a dick, wrote down a lot of funny stories and ultimately realized that I could go college in spite of dropping out of high school because I happened to install the non-traditional student advisor&#x27;s cable modem.My colleagues said they&#x27;d see me back at the shop in four years after I graduated with a philosophy degree.

I&#x27;m really a bit surprised to hear this.I did a similar job early on in my career (involving cheap phone calling devices with customers including consumers and often dodgy &#x27;calling shops&#x27;).

Less charitably, our country has a bunch of bullies that want to shout at anything they can bully. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d actually pull the trigger, but, y&#x27;know, law of large numbers, times small but non-zero probability of homicide by virtue a gun being present on the scene equals probably at least one murdered cable tech.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluralistic.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;28&#x2F;holographic-nano-layer-ca... reply sublinear 5 hours agorootparent> Americans really, really love to abuse the shit out of customer service workers.That wasn&#x27;t my experience when I worked in customer service for a few years. Maybe 10% of people were like that and it was always because they were tired of not getting solutions to their problems, and that was always because their account fell into a bad spot in the customer service flow policy (suspicious activity, low LTV, fraud, etc.).

But the sheer scale of the US population and the absolute number of guns is just difficult to conceive of from a European perspective. We have something like 60 privately owned guns in this country for every person in the Czech Republic. So even if only 1% of our gun-owning population were irresponsible or criminal with them, it would still add up to a lot of deaths every day. reply midasuni 2 hours agorootparentOh another “The US is big” post.The EU has 30% more peopleThere are 60 times as many privately owned guns in the EU as there are in Montana.There are 5 time as many guns in the US, but 20 times as many murders.There is a cultural problem in the US with firearms. reply darkclouds 8 minutes agorootparentDoes that include places like Switzerland, where every male is issued with a gun as part of their national service&#x2F;canton militia?I think the cultural problem is everyone wants to be like Stallone or Arnie, which would suggest the US population has an inferiority complex towards the old world. reply midasuni 0 minutes agorootparentNo. Switzerland isn’t in the EU.

Well bad apples and stuff, it&#x27;s hard to believe perfect discipline is maintained when some of those around you have less than perfect discipline.It seems like a question that one could probably get pretty close to answering (although not perfect). reply noduerme 2 hours agorootparentJust from personal experience among my friends and acquaintances - and anyone I meet who I chance to talk about guns with - there is a very strong self-reinforcing culture of safe handling and responsibility. People will come down incredibly hard on anyone who seems inept or who they even hear speaking about some kind of irresponsible behavior. Now, I&#x27;d say about half of these are ex-military people, but they set a standard and keep other people in line. Of course, perfect discipline isn&#x27;t maintained in this country. But it&#x27;s actually one of the few areas where pretty much everyone knows they must act like a responsible adult. People are well aware that it&#x27;s their life or their freedom are stake if they mess up.

Was this in a state or city with a registry for AR-15s?\"Loaded straight into fairly skinny jeans without checking the safety.\" -- Glocks do not have safeties.The idea with most newer striker-fired pistols, like the Glock, is that the gun goes in a hard-sided (molded nylon or kydex) holster. If it&#x27;s not in the holster, it&#x27;s ready to fire. If that is not safe in the situation you are in, put it back in the holster.Rifles, shotguns, &c, are never holstered; so if it is time to fire the weapon, you deactivate the safety; otherwise, it is left on safe. Because pistols have the extra step of being holstered, it turns out be work well in practice not to have the intermediate unholstered-but-safe step. reply avidiax 3 hours agorootparent> \"Registered to a different person\" -- for the most part, guns are not registered in the USA. Was this in a state or city with a registry for AR-15s?Handguns are registered to a tiny degree.

By order of congress, this office is not allowed to computerize. reply solidsnack9000 1 hour agorootparentIn some states and in some cities, handguns are registered; but in most states, they are not registered to any degree.A registry connects a particular gun -- a particular serial number -- to a particular person. A NICS check doesn&#x27;t do that -- it&#x27;s a criminal background check. Just because you have a NICS check, it doesn&#x27;t mean you bought any particular gun. You could pass the background check and then decide you don&#x27;t want the gun after all.You may be referring to a Form 4473 -- the DRoS (Dealer Record of Sale) -- which does record which person received which gun (with serial number) -- and all licensed dealers maintain these records, for all guns they sell (not just handguns). These records form a sort of a search tree, since the manufacturer records which wholesaler the serial number went to the, the wholesaler records the retailer and the retailer records the end user. These records are useful in regulating the traffic in arms; but the decentralized nature of them means that the government can not go on fishing expeditions -- can not just go out and query the database and see what looks interesting today.Here&#x27;s how the DRoS are used in regulating the arms trade. Say police come across a big box of guns from Colt. They can go to Colt with a suitable warrant and say, hey, where did these go to? And then go to the wholesaler, on down the tree.

This is actually quite safe in practice because pistols are holstered in common use -- this makes them very different from rifles, shotguns, &c. With a pistol safety, there is an intermediate, \"unholstered-but-on-safe\" state that doesn&#x27;t exist with rifles. This turns out to be dangerous in practice because people can think the pistol is on safe when it isn&#x27;t; or think it is ready to fire when they need it to and, lo and behold, it&#x27;s not. It turns out to be safer in practice to just assume the gun is shootable when it&#x27;s out of the holster -- and if that&#x27;s not safe enough for the situation you&#x27;re in, put it back in the holster!Glocks have a system that is systems called \"safe action\" where there is a system of internal locks that prevents the weapon from firing in situations where the gun is dropped, hit by a car, struck from the side, &c -- this is not really what most people are thinking of when they think of a safety. It turns out to be very important in practice, though.

What good is people walking around in shopping malls with large semi automatic rifles on their back? reply OhMeadhbh 4 hours agorootparentI always thought it had more to do with a sense of personal agency than reasoned expectation of using a firearm to protect myself (or someone around me) from harm.Firearms can, in many situations, allow you to enforce your will over that of other people who may be intent on harming you or others.The thing I never quite understood is why so many of us believe they&#x27;ll encounter those situations walking to train station in the urban core.So in one sense, I think I can understand the thinking behind it but at the same time think people are mistaken for how often you&#x27;ll need to shoot someone while walking home in the city or in the burbs.That being said... I worked part time as an agent for a bail bondsman to pay for college and frequently carried large sums of cash with me through bad neighborhoods. I open carried with the approval of the sheriff&#x27;s office and municipal police departments largely as a reminder that I could shoot back. But I never had to. The last person a potential criminal wants to shoot at is their bail bondsman... I never drew, aimed or fired my firearm in two years of working that job. In many ways I think it was like part of a \"costume\" that communicated I had the weight of social convention on my side. reply OhMeadhbh 3 hours agorootparentprev@nojvek -- also... are you seeing people in shopping malls open carrying or are you seeing news articles on TV or online talking about people in shopping malls open carrying? Also, my personal experience is you&#x27;re MUCH more likely to see someone open carrying at the feed store in the rural parts of the country than at a proper shopping mall in the urban core.

I own firearms, but they&#x27;re locked in a gun safe. I pull them out every now and again, drive them to a gun range, fire them, clean them and then put them back in the safe.And I believe this is the experience of the overwhelming majority of gun owners in the US.It occurs to me I haven&#x27;t seen any estimates for how many people open carry on a daily basis. (You would think SOMEONE would collect that data SOMEWHERE.)The states are sort of (in)famous for how many people own firearms, but I assert the number of people who open carry on a daily (or weekly) basis is much smaller than the number of people who own firearms.I&#x27;m going to stop short of accusing nojvek of nutpicking, but encourage them to look around. The stats I&#x27;ve seen are that one in three Americans owns a firearm. If you were walking around and one out of three people were open carrying... well... I think that would be a little unusual unless you were in a gun show or at a shooting range.Gun-culture in America can be weird, but it&#x27;s often portrayed as being weirder than it actually is.[Edit: also. how did we go from cable modems to guns so quickly?] reply noduerme 2 hours agorootparentprev>> Almost no one actually does thisMore to the point, none of the few nutjobs who insist on doing this has ever actually carried out a mass shooting.

We kept calling, and they kept sending out tech after tech. I don&#x27;t recall what the final tech fixed, but they complained that all of the previous techs should have spotted the issue.

As much as you might like it to mean that, that&#x27;s not what the law says. reply bbarnett 4 hours agorootparentOn top of that, it takes equipment, hardware, personnel, infrastructure, power to deliver cable. The OP literally has no idea what they are talking about, and could use the same logic for electricity theft. reply notpushkin 3 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a subtle but very important difference.Electricity theft does extract a resource from the grid (electricity provider needs to supply the energy you&#x27;re using on the other end). Similarly, phreaking uses phone lines which is a finite resource too (and phone company would rather keep those available for paying customers).Cable on the other hand runs all channels to your household in the first place. By removing the filter, you aren&#x27;t creating any additional load on the cable network or using any additional resources for free. reply bbarnett 2 hours agorootparentOne might argue that when viewed, there is current draw, and that additional channels typically means more viewing.But I was thinking of overall service theft, and did not think of the filter. That case is different.This makes me think, though. I lived through this time, and adding the filter makes zero logistic sense. EG, why have anyone, who isn&#x27;t paying, even connected?Then I remembered something.I lived in a house, where there was a shared box for 2 units. Someone had pried open the box, and removed the filters. As a result, the cable guy disconnected the wire at the pole.This resulted in something different. Instead of a cutoff, most channels came through, just very fuzzy. And as a kid, I lived in a rural area, and we owned an antenna booster&#x2F;amp, which had made signals poorer than this, crystal clear.It seemed that leaving an uncapped end inside a box on the pole, with loads of signal, bled enough for a usable signal to get through.So this is probably why a filter was placed. And of course, to prevent the long wire from picking up local over the air stuff too.Ah well. reply BLKNSLVR 3 hours agorootparentprevMany years ago the house I was living in had cable (foxtel, Australia) connected, but the residents who had paid for it had moved out and were no longer paying for it, therefore it sat as an unused plug in the wall for a good couple of years.I got one of those old \"TV cards\", so you could hook up an antenna and have TV on your computer (yeah, this was before \"internet\" was better than TV for moving picture entertainment) and had heard about software that could decode foxtel signal.After a lot of futzing about, and failed attempts, it started working well enough to be watchable - although most of the content was shit, it was foxtel after all.My point being - the signal is sent through the cable either way. Whether there&#x27;s a device at the end of it or not. Equipment, hardware, personnel, power was provided by me to get it working. The previous residents paid for the connection of the cable itself. The data is all sent down the pipe whether or not someone was watching it at the far end, just due to the nature of cable at the time.I get your electricity analogy though, but I really don&#x27;t know if it applies to the data being sent down the cable. I doubt it cost \"faceless them\" any extra as my understanding was that the cable was a shared signal by the street (or some other small-ish communal size).Once I got it working, I mostly lost interest :) reply bbarnett 2 hours agorootparentA good story, the only interest was in the hack.A lot of older sci-fi books, eg Heinlein, had hacker types discovering some highly profitable thing, but being uninterested except it was fun to figure out.

Tradespeople prioritize based on how much a job pays. So if you haggle them down, make them deal with insurance, or your type of job doesn&#x27;t command much money, they&#x27;ll happily keep you in their queue as an option in case work dries up, but won&#x27;t be interested in doing your job as long as they&#x27;re getting paid more for doing other jobs. reply pmx 48 minutes agorootparentWhich is entirely reasonable, no?

With the exception of anarcho-capitalists, those who believe in a free market regard the government&#x27;s role as integral, in providing public goods like an effective justice system that polices misbehavior like fraud.What distinguishes a belief in free markets is believing that misbehavior—that government bodies have a right to punish and prohibit—does not include mutually voluntary interactions, like selling high-risk financial instruments to willing customers, who according to a court, are deemed to have provided informed consent to those risks. reply OhMeadhbh 3 hours agorootparentEvery time I see the phrase \"free market\" I like to point out the term originated from Adam Smith who used it to describe \"markets free from rent-seeking behaviour.\" Which is COMPLETELY different than the way the phrase is used today.Also, \"Capitalism\" used to mean \"using capital to increase capital.\" We now use it to mean \"using capital to increase private wealth.\"I understand what you&#x27;re trying to say and am not refuting it.

As you can imagine having broadband just for 4 months for a forigner was something of a unique deal for them, we had to go into some sort of special agreement at the Comcast desk (I do not remember much of the specifics) of which I felt I must have a proof about on top of the spoken promise of the representative that &#x27;this and that will work this way in your situation&#x27;. Somehow I felt the one cancelling my service will not be that keen on alterations like the one I talked with about getting into contract with them. I am unsure but I think I asked for a written additional note some sort or perhaps went into an agreed recording of the conversation, but what I am sure about is that my wife - who left later than me and managed the closure of the service - had difficulty convincing them that it was just a 4 months service not an early termination of a 12 or 24 months one. Those proof asked was life saver with them and left a dent in my recollection that words of Comcast is not to be trusted easily but you need armor strength explicit proofs surrounding you in dealing with them.And actually with several others. Since then the similar paranoid defensive dealing with overly kind and eager representatives saved me lots of trouble. It is exhausting not to trust anything and is shame we have to waste time and energy on such instead of just honest processes. reply munro 26 minutes agoprevThis is really the amazing part of the internet, seeing a file that has been casually hosted on a web server since 1999, not even budging for HTTPS-- I feel teleported back in time reply russell_h 7 hours agoprevI don’t understand why she would have to sign a waiver absolving Comcast in order to have her criminal record expunged.

This kind of exponential growth leads to outlandish estimates for the amount of tidal energy that society will demand.Energy consumption has decoupled from population growth rates and economic growth.How much energy will we consume in 1,000 years? Most projections of the population have it stabilizing at around 15 billion. But continuing at its current growth rate (an optimistic assumption I think), gets us to about 150 trillion humans in 1,000 years.And at 2% growth rate, each of those humans will consume 20,000 times more energy than a circa 2023 human.Now state of the art technology wastes about 80% of the energy consumed, so this is equivalent to 100,000 times more useful energy consumed per human.So the physics in this page is a good examination of the surprisingly large compounding effects of unchecked exponential growth. reply RetroTechie 14 hours agoparent> The single most important assumption in this paper is that energy consumption will increase by 2% per year.There&#x27;s a 2nd big assumption:That tidal energy extracted is additional Earth&#x27;s rotational energy loss above what Earth does by itself.According to the paper, tidal energy is dissipated through friction between ocean water & the seafloor. This dissipated energy subtracts from Earth&#x27;s rotational energy. And some rotational energy is transferred to the moon (which makes the moon move further out). Ok so far.Author&#x27;s 2nd assumption is that as tidal energy is tapped, this is extra energy that subtracts from Earth&#x27;s rotation.But is it? It might also be that tidal energy extracted by humans, comes out of some fixed &#x27;budget&#x27;, and the remainder is dissipated naturally. More tidal energy extracted by humans -> less tidal energy dissipated through ocean vs. seafloor friction.Kind of like solar influx: it&#x27;s a huge but (apart from fluctuations) fixed amount. We can tap some % of that potential, but what&#x27;s available doesn&#x27;t increase. And what humans don&#x27;t tap, gets absorbed &#x2F; radiated out by other natural processes.I won&#x27;t even hazard a guess. But it would be interesting to figure out which of those applies. reply onlyrealcuzzo 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a bit absurd the idea that humans living on earth are going to produce more energy than the Sun.Maybe I&#x27;m naive and simple minded. But that just seems insane.If I&#x27;m doing the math right, at 2.3% growth = we produce more energy than the Sun in 4500 years.It doesn&#x27;t matter how many years it is. It&#x27;s never happening.Just look at how damn hot and inhospitable the sun is. We&#x27;re not producing more energy here!It&#x27;d be infinitely more plausible to build a Dyson sphere around the Sun, and call me naive on that, too, but I&#x27;m skeptical that&#x27;s ever gonna happen either. reply wudangmonk 5 hours agorootparentNot a Dyson sphere, a Dyson swarm makes more sense and its doable since it can be very sparse at the beginning and grow denser with time. reply SEJeff 6 hours agorootparentprevAnd it’s been said that the mass requires to build a Dyson sphere around our sun would necessitate destroying all of the planets: not gonna happen. reply hollerith 11 hours agorootparentprev>Author&#x27;s 2nd assumption is that as tidal energy is tapped, this is extra energy that subtracts from Earth&#x27;s rotation.Not so. The calculation of the 1031 years is equation 19 and assumes the decrease in rotational energy all goes to human purposes.The flaw in the OP is the assumption that human consumption keeps rising at .02 per year for 1031 years: we would probably boil the oceans away because of the waste heat from using that much electrical power. reply gumby 9 hours agorootparent> we would probably boil the oceans away because of the waste heat from using that much electrical power.Which would slow the earth due to the change in angular momentum reply ricardobeat 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, the assumption seems to be that any energy extracted is in addition to the friction with the ocean floor and continental plates, as those will continue to exist. reply pmontra 13 hours agorootparentprevYour observation seems to make sense.Intuitively, if we extract energy from the tides, tides will be less tall and the speed of water will be smaller. Ocean currents will slow down too.What I don&#x27;t know is, less friction on the seafloor means that we would actually make Earth slow down less faster than it would do if left alone? reply Interloper2099 9 hours agorootparentIt’s a bit odd to extrapolate to this level. It’s like thinking, yes, I can set one tree on fire and release energy, but look how crazy it is if all the trees in North America burn at once!!And currents are also affected by the rotation of the Earth, temp differences, and salinity differences so they might not change dramatically. reply codethief 13 hours agoparentprev> The single most important assumption in this paper is that energy consumption will increase by 2% per year.

The physics guy only seems to realize that though when he wakes up the next day and has calmed down a bit.Although the link is useful for the thermodynamic calculations, there are two major problems with the argument as presented:1. Right up front the physicist arbitrarily bans space travel. The economist, being an agreeable man who&#x27;d probably rather be making smalltalk with a pleasant member of the opposite sex rather than defending his whole profession to a bolshie physicist, accepts this limitation, but he shouldn&#x27;t have done. Nothing in economics is predicated on a space travel ban. We are already obtaining economic growth from space via satellites and that era has barely got started. None of the physics arguments work if you make the relatively small leap to putting factories, power plants etc on moons, asteroids, space stations or other planets. This doesn&#x27;t require colonization assuming progress in robotics.2. Much more seriously, the physicist doesn&#x27;t understand what growth or wealth mean in an economic context. The economist tries patiently to explain this to him many times, and he just doesn&#x27;t get it. This is a very common problem when talking about economics because people aren&#x27;t used to the expansive definition of wealth economists use, so often conflate it with other things like money or (in this case) energy.You can increase wealth indefinitely even with a stable population and stable energy&#x2F;resource usage. This isn&#x27;t controversial or weird, it&#x27;s just part of how wealth is defined. The VR example is one attempt, dessert another attempt to explain this to him, but he just doesn&#x27;t get it until the next day when he suddenly has an epiphany but decides it wasn&#x27;t his fault because he personally distinguishes between \"growth\" and \"development\". No such distinction is recognized by actual economists for valid reasons. But you don&#x27;t get to claim there&#x27;s a problem with economics just because you failed to understand the lingo of the field. reply jl2718 11 hours agorootparentprevWhen the nuclear apocalypse has passed, and the last remaining humans are living underground on mushrooms, somewhere an economist will claim growth using a model updated to include the work done by ants, and somewhere a bureaucrat will update the tax code to collect on it. reply istjohn 7 hours agorootparentprevA global cooling system is easily conceivable. The ISS uses radiators to dissipate heat into outer space. We could do the same. We could concentrate heat with heat pumps and pump hot steam, molten salt, or plasma up a space elevator and radiate the heat away.Edit: The link points out that in 1,400 years we&#x27;d be using energy at the rate produced by the sun and in 2,500 years at the rate of the entire Milky Way. Even if we solved the heat radiation problem, it seems unlikely we&#x27;d be able to obtain fuel for our fusion reactors at a sufficient rate given the speed of light and the density of matter in the universe. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentThere’s no free lunch.The sun radiates heat like a blackbody sphere with the surface area of the sun and a surface temperature of 5600K or so.If the Earth were to have a fancy heat pump that radiated the same amount of heat into space, it would need the radiating area times the effective temperature to the fourth power equal to that of the sun. The real killer problem is that your heat pump is subject to the Carnot efficiency of pumping heat to that same temperature.By the most straightforward Second Law calculation, entropy transferred to hot side >= entropy removed from cold side. So Q_hot &#x2F; T_hot >= Q_cold &#x2F; T_cold. Q_cold is the heat removed from the pleasant ~300K place where the humans are. At 5600K on the hot side, 18.6 times as much heat needs to be radiated out, so for every bit of useful work done on Earth, at least 17.6 times as much energy is consumed in cooling. If you want the radiator to be only half the surface area of the sun, multiply that by about 16.What future humans really need is a Dyson sphere with absolutely enormous radiating area. :) reply anon____ 4 hours agorootparentWell then maybe we should do this at night, i.e. always on the dark side of the Earth, not the one that&#x27;s facing the Sun.

Arguably solar and wind cannot scale 1000x but then you could have non thermal fusion like Helion&#x27;s https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helionenergy.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;.Btw, thermal power is already showing limits (rivers overheating in summers), we don&#x27;t have to wait 400 years to see its failure. reply codethief 10 hours agorootparent> This boiling temperature conclusion makes the assumption that we continue using thermal power (steam engines, etc...), where waste heat is around 60%.No, it doesn&#x27;t. The waste heat, at the very end of the day, is always rather close to 100%. I.e. we use all that electric energy we generate to power computer, fridges, and many other machines, all of which – sooner or later – convert that electric energy to heat. (And, well, maybe a bit of chemical binding energy, depending on the application. But then, a few decades later, those products of our work will usually fall apart and&#x2F;or are being burnt or torn down.)> you could have non thermal fusion like Helion&#x27;sNo, you can&#x27;t.

That is, there exist intractable limits to growth, and that no matter how convenient it may be to pretend otherwise, humans ignore this fact at their extreme peril.Long-term ongoing economic growth, expressed as a constant percentage, is baked in to most current orthodox economics and economic policy. Even apparent mavericks such as Thomas Piketty assume that growth will continue interminably (noted in Capital in the Twenty-First Century).Rather than being a critique of Liu, you&#x27;ve actually written a criticism of those he himself is generally addressing. reply xg15 11 hours agorootparentI think there is one escape from this, basically confining more and more \"growth\" to artificial numbers on paper (or in a DB).Cryptocurrencies are kind of going in that direction, where the \"value\" that is reported as economic growth doesn&#x27;t correspond to any kind of real-world matter or activity, but is simply assigned to some specific group of bits.I can kind of believe that this virtual kind of growth could continue a long time without boiling the planet, but of course that doesn&#x27;t make things less absurd, as the \"value\" would represent nothing objectively useful and would have to be maintained artificially - either through scarcity mechanisms like PoW etc, or through locked-down devices and ecosystems.So that kind of \"growth\" could go on forever without burning the planet but would probably be a step back for civilization. reply dredmorbius 10 hours agorootparentThe problem with this, or any other hypothetical \"decoupled growth\" argument is that, well, it&#x27;s purely hypothetical.There&#x27;s no evidence whatsoever that economic growth can be decoupled from resource, and most especially energy, usage. There are instances of increased efficiencies, which thanks to the Jevons Paradox increase overall resource utilisation (economically, efficiency is equivalent to a reduced price, and hence induces greater demand). And there are instances of outsourced resource utilisation (both in terms of inputs and of waste sinks), most notably that of China which has committed tremendous domestic resources and incurred immense environmental insult in providing \"cheap goods\" (that is: goods lacking fully-costed externality impacts) to developed countries.But there&#x27;s nary a trace of actual empirical evidence of substantive decoupling in the real world. Much handwaving and could-be&#x27;s, however. reply snowwrestler 7 hours agorootparentIt’s only hypothetical in that the future hasn’t arrived yet. Most predictions are hypothetical by that criteria.We know the economy is decoupled from physical limits because we have built it to be that way. If you go to my bank right now, they are not going to have a physical pile of valuable objects there which is my account balance. They have a computer that stores numbers, and obviously it needs energy to operate, but it doesn’t cost 10x energy to store 10,000 instead of 1,000 in the database entry for my account balance. reply dredmorbius 5 hours agorootparentQing Dynasty China had \"decoupled\" its currency from specie by way of the first paper-based currency I&#x27;m aware of. See: Richard von Glahn, Fountain of Fortune: Money and Monetary Policy in China 1000-1700 (1996).But that has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with decoupling the actual economy from its physical foundations. Long after Qing, China remained fundamentally dependent on rice and wheat harvests (and suffered tremendous population losses, as much as 8 million deaths) many centuries later.The wealth-tracking representation has been decoupled from any substance with intrinsic value, but the economy has not.Put another way: you could have a monetary system in which currency was entirely backed in precious gold and silver, and introduce huge quantities of same to your economy ... without increasing the actual wealth of the nation by Adam Smith&#x27;s definition, \"annual produce and labour of the nation\". This was precisely the situation Spain found itself in following its conquest of the Americas and importation of vast quantities of South American gold and silver. reply snowwrestler 3 hours agorootparent> The wealth-tracking representation has been decoupled from any substance with intrinsic value, but the economy has not.If you insist on measuring the economy solely in terms of \"substances with intrinsic value,\" you will find the limit of economic growth at approximately the limit of those substances. However this is begging the question because it&#x27;s not the only way (and not the currently accepted way) of measuring economies.Anyway, it&#x27;s not just the representation, wealth itself is increasingly nonphysical and hypothetical. For example not only is my $1,000 bank account just a database entry, my database entry is most likely offset by about $900 in loans to other people. So my saved cash is actually about 90% claims on future payments by other people. Or look at stocks; at a P&#x2F;E of around 20 currently, 95% of the value of my SP500 index fund is hypothetical. And of course the whole point of a bond is future payments.Market-winning behaviors are also becoming less physically correlated. Did Barbie take 5x as much energy as The Flash to make or present? Does a 3 bedroom row house in San Francisco use 5x as much energy as a similar house in Detroit? Does Apple use 3x as much energy as Amazon? Does it take twice as much energy to make a Mercedes C class as a Honda Accord? There are tons of examples like this. Rice and wheat harvests are a pretty small part of modern economies now.Look, I agree that a certain level of energy usage is required to enable economic activity. If we were to cut our energy use too much, we would limit or perhaps crash the economy. People need food, clothes, shelter, plumbing, communications, etc. I&#x27;m just saying: that is not equivalent to proving that future economic growth is bounded by energy usage. One does not logically follow from the other. reply dredmorbius 2 hours agorootparentIf you insist on measuring the economy solely in terms of \"substances with intrinsic value\" ...I don&#x27;t, and specifically pointed out precisely an instance where money was not grounded in material goods. However that is a red herring as money is not wealth but is instead a measure of wealth. My own theory is that the reason many monetary systems have been based on specie or some similar intrinsically valuable material has to do not with coupling&#x2F;decoupling of production to physical inputs, but to trust. That is, when you have a money-issuing authority imbued with high trust, the need for metal-backed currency disappears. \"Seigniorage\" is then a measure of trust in the money-issuing authority, and fiat currency (with effectively infinite seniorage) implies complete trust.(The concern that such authorities occasionally abuse their trust, and&#x2F;or run up against circumstances in which deflating the currency becomes a financial and economic necessity, is a separate issue. That problem isn&#x27;t limited to fiat currencies, however, as the devaluation of specie-based currency such as the Roman denarius illustrates.)The relationship between economic output and material inputs, specifically energy inputs, has been identified by several authors, in particular Steve Keen and Robert U. Ayres, \"A Note on the Role of Energy in Production\":Energy plays no role in the standard Cobb-Douglas Production Function (CDPF), and a trivial role in a three-factor CDPF where it is treated as a third input, independent of labour and capital. Starting from an epistemological perspective, we treat energy as an input to both labour and capital, without which production is impossible. We then derive an energy-based CPDF (EBCDPF) in which energy plays a critical role. We argue for the redefinition and measurement of real GDP in terms of exergy. We conclude that the “Solow Residual” measures the contribution of exergy to growth, and that the exponents in the EBCDPF should be based on cross-country comparative data as suggested by Mankiw (1995) rather than the “cost-share theorem”.As Keen and Ayres note, including energy along with capital and labour in the Cobb-Douglas production function accounts for virtually all of the \"Solow Residual\", the amount of productivity not accounted for by capital or labour, and which was previously attributed to \"total factor productivity\". Keen & Ayres reduce that almost entirely to energy input.Your sojourn into prices as opposed to wealth creation (in the real economic sense, rather than the somewhat more familiar, but irrelevent in this case, financial sense) is yet another red herring. Asset prices are not intrinsically grounded in production costs, particularly for price-inelastic goods such as real estate. Rather than being defined by costs of production, they&#x27;re defined by surplus value, and following the theory of rents first expressed by David Ricardo, the seller will tend to accrue surplus consumer value of such assets. That is, real estate prices rise to match the income potential of that location.Information-heavy good such as luxury brands (Apple, Mercedes), entertainment (cinema), are based on a combination of manipulating tastes (advertising and marketing, reputation), constraining supply (particularly in real estate), and in competition for a limited resources (cinema screenings vs. cinema audiences). Note that in the case of cinema, costs of production are independent of viewings, so the industry is very interested in both total budget and ticket sales. But individual ticket prices tend to be relatively uniform across titles, what varies instead are the number of butts in seats. (This varies somewhat: Imax theatres may claim higher prices, but again, this tends to be across all titles, and matinee or off-peak screenings may offer lower prices, but again, uniformly for titles.)Rice and wheat, as well as oil, gas, and coal, are commodity goods, not assets in the sense of real estate and gold. They&#x27;re subject to supply and demand, but prices are determined by the marginal or surplus producer, depending on market circumstances. Where demand is less than total production capacity, the surplus producer, that is, the producer who can choose to sell more or less product at will, determines price based on their own production quotas. From 1931--1972, this was the United States, managed through the US Department of Interior (via \"certificates of clearance\")[1] and the Texas Railroad Commission (through drilling and production quotas)[2]. Since 1973, control has effectively resided with Saudi Arabia, as the US passed domestic peak oil and no longer had surplus production capacity.Where demand exceeds production capacity, it is the marginal producer of oil, that is, the one whose costs just allow operating profit at the present market price.[3] As market prices rise and fall, those marginal producers enter and leave the market, literally turning on or off well pumps, with the cost of running the pump often dominating their own production costs of their \"stripper wells\".[4]Because fuels, and foods, literally power the rest of the economy, as prices for either rise, there is less profitable activity to be undertaken by utilising them. If we express national productivity in terms of $GDP&#x2F;barrel-oil, there is a range of roughly $300--400 at the low end to ~$3000 at the high end, with the US coming in at about $1,200&#x2F;bbl of GDP.[5] If oil costs $50&#x2F;bbl, then that is $1,150 of net productivity per barrel. Should the price rise to $100, the productivity falls to $1,100. The US can afford this reasonably well. A country netting only $250 profit at $50&#x2F;bbl however falls to $200, or a loss of 25% of economic productivity. (India and China were at about this mark.)The low price of food and energy masks their true value to the economy, because it is precisely the differential in price and output which is what determines the scale of the rest of the economy. Take away fuels and foods, and you&#x27;ll find that total productivity falls by far more than the previous total exchange value of those goods.________________________________Notes:1.

They create companies, regulatory bodies, and financial systems which are predicated on growth. They create economic ideology and the mechanisms for promulgating it which are founded on growth. They create development patterns (most especially of urban land use --- the most massive impact of the automobile was on city and suburban landscapes), and consumption patterns.Once entrenched, those are all exceedingly difficult to dislodge.I&#x27;d argue that China is wrestling with this now, and that a fair bit of the disruption of the past few years (above and beyond exogenous shocks, notably Covid-19) involve this, as the CCP attempts to wrest power back from industrial, financial, and real estate interests.Some European countries (notably the Netherlands and Amsterdam with its bicycle- and transit-centric transport planning), Japan, and possibly others such as Costa Rica, seem to have followed a lower-growth curve. These may actually find transition more viable.At the capital of capitalism, the United States, transition faces absolutely massive obstructions in the form of politics, politics-expressed-as-social-values, economic interests, finance, real estate, land use, transportation, building codes (residential, commercial, and industrial), and more. Those are far more significant obstructions than actual technical solutions, and the more illuminating advocates of sustainability that I follow tend to emphasize this.(I&#x27;ll list these later, though I&#x27;m still waiting for XorNot to cough up.

Not about the sustainability of tidal power. This becomes obvious once you look closer at what that 2% growth rate (as assumed in the post) implies.Our global energy consumption in 2008 was estimated to be 474 exajoules. The total energy received by the earth from the sun during a year is about 5 million exajoules, a fraction of which reaches the surface. 5 million is much more than 474. But at a seemingly modest 2% per year growth rate (as it was between 1980 and 2006), our energy consumption will match those 5 million exajoules in less than 500 years!Think about that: if energy consumption growth continues at the current pace, then in 500 years we&#x27;ll either be using ALL solar energy received by the earth (leaving none for the biosphere), or we&#x27;ll have figured out some magic technology to produce 5 million exajoules of energy per year. Assuming the magic technology, where are we going to get rid of all that extra heat?

If you are exports were dominated specifically by the use of energy (over say human capital or laxer pollution standards) that intensity would rise because it would be the source of the economic advantage. I.e. if domestic consumption trade 1 unit of energy for one unit of growth but exports trades 2 units of energy for one unit of growth intensity will rise if exports dominate the energy mix. That does not seem to be the case.A huge proportion of US imports seem to be based on \"assembly\" from what I can tell, the dominant categories from China are electrical&#x2F;electronic goods and industrial machines - most of the stuff is the assembling of US & EU (and Taiwan for semiconductor reasons) made parts.. the energy mix of the import-export dynamic seems like it needs a lot of analysis - I would like something authoritative that shows an attempt at an analysis, I can&#x27;t seem to find it. reply littlestymaar 3 hours agorootparent> If you are exports were dominated specifically by the use of energy (over say human capital or laxer pollution standards)But nobody ever said that.

I didn&#x27;t really understand how tapping into the power source could possibly cause an additional loss that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise happen. reply esjeon 1 hour agoprevThe time limit of 1000 years is the worst part of this paper. If the energy consumption literally grows 2% every year, in 3013, the humanity will be consuming 3.98x10^8 times more energy than now. If it&#x27;s really the case, the dissipation heat from the use of such a large amount of energy alone will kill us all, long before the tidal lock b&#x2F;w the earth and the moon. reply FriedPickles 15 hours agoprevHmm so if we pump water to amplify the tides we can speed up the Earth&#x27;s spin and get rid of the leap second. reply jaggederest 15 hours agoparentThis has already happened, actually. Some leap seconds have been skipped iirc due to faster rotation from all the impounded water in reservoirs in northern regions. reply kps 9 hours agoparentprevWe should draw tidal power until there are exactly 360 days in a year, to make the arithmetic nice, and incidentally give us 24 minutes extra sleep. reply alwayslikethis 8 hours agorootparentThe other way of doing this is just pushing the earth a bit off its orbit. Better to do it in the other direction though to stop global warming. Let&#x27;s make it 400 days instead. reply istjohn 6 hours agorootparent360 is much nicer than 400 though. 12 months of 30 days each versus 10 40-day months or 16 25-day months. reply jcims 15 hours agoparentprevlol great minds think alike reply sudhirj 15 hours agoprevThis is the old my kid was two feet tall a year ago and three feet tall this year, so by the time she&#x27;s an adult she&#x27;s going to be as tall as a house! reply chx 11 hours agoparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;605&#x2F; reply almenon 15 hours agoprevRelevant: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;6400&#x2F;are-tidal-p...This theory is very interesting, although the author presents it with too much confidence for such big claims. reply Aachen 15 hours agoparentIn that link:> The Earth&#x27;s rotational kinetic energy is about 10²9 J, and the world uses something like 10²² J&#x2F;year, so you could power the entire world for millions of years before you&#x27;d run out of rotational energy.(my phone somehow has a ² but not a ^9; the first number is supposed to be 1e29) reply schoen 4 hours agorootparentHere are some Unicode exponents for your future needs: ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹ reply crazygringo 14 hours agoprevTons of comments here highlighting that 2% annual growth rate in energy consumption is ludicrous.But so what if we made a more reasonable assumption that annual energy usage will stabilize at, say, 5X of what it is currently, and the (unreasonable) assumption that we get 100% of that energy from tides.Then how much of a rotational slowdown do we get after 1000 years? reply MichaelDickens 14 hours agoparentAccording to the paper, tidal energy has a total capacity of 10^29 Joules, and current global energy consumption is 10^21 Joules per year, so if we converted 100% of current energy consumption to tidal energy and didn&#x27;t increase it at all, it would last 10^8 = 100 million years (rounded to the nearest power of 10).Equivalently, after 1000 years, we&#x27;d see a rotational slowdown of around 0.001%. reply crazygringo 13 hours agorootparentThanks so much. That feels much more in line with intuition.So maybe not technically renewable, but many orders of magnitude more renewable than e.g. fossil fuels... reply zamadatix 12 hours agorootparentAny useful interpretation of renewable energy has to do with purely human timeframes as thermodynamics doesn&#x27;t allow for any energy source to be endlessly renewable. \"If I use this source today will more of it naturally be there tomorrow\" type consideration, otherwise you end up with a definition which either includes things like fossil fuels as renewable because you can wait millions of years or excludes things like sunlight because it won&#x27;t be there in 10 billion years. reply Jweb_Guru 6 hours agorootparentWell, there is a more important sense in which solar is renewable but not tidal energy. The sun does not burn out appreciably more quickly if we use a larger percentage of the available solar energy, it&#x27;s there whether we use it or not. This is not the case for tidal energy. replyjccooper 15 hours agoprevThis is mostly based on the assumption of a 2% growth rate in overall energy consumption, with tidal power as an ever-growing 1% of that. The effect of covering 1% of our current energy usage would be minimal. And, likely, the ability to exploit tidal power will plateau at some (fairly small) amount, due to geographic constraints. reply jiggawatts 4 hours agoprevThe author makes the point that the slow-down of the day is non-linear, and then he uses a linear equation to estimate the time until the Earth is locked to the Moon!His doomsday scenario of total tidal locking would never occur -- as energy is removed from the rotation of the Earth, the maximum power level that can be extracted would decrease. Also, the cost-efficiency would also drop.There would be a point where the day is \"merely\" longer, the Earth is not yet tidally locked to the Moon, but extracting more tidal energy is no longer worth the trouble.The original point however is still valid. Even if the rotation was slowed to just 1&#x2F;2 of what it is now, the Earth would have a 48-hour day and that would obviously cause absolute havoc with the environment. reply idlewords 15 hours agoprevEvery energy source becomes renewable on the right time scale. reply exitheone 15 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s not actually true. The conditions for the formation of coal and oil may likely never happen again because the bacteria to break decompose trees did not exist then but exist now, making oil formation impossible because trees decompose now. Unless they all die out, we won&#x27;t get any new oil ever. reply mcqueenjordan 13 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s a joke about how all finite sequences will repeat during infinite time. But it doesn&#x27;t really add anything to the discussion. reply DFHippie 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m curious about this. We certainly won&#x27;t get any more coal, but a whole lot of carbon gets subducted into the mantle regularly. Some gets turned into diamonds. Some gets blown out of volcanoes. Is the oil we pump out of the ground produced directly in the continental crust or is it generated from some of this carbon subducted with oceanic crust that has been transformed by some process and then made its way back into continental crust?I&#x27;m lazy, so I&#x27;m hoping some geologist will stop by and educate me. reply arghwhat 15 hours agoparentprevAnd every energy source becomes non-renewable on the right time scale.Post humanity, post-earth time scales might not be relevant to most discussions. reply giblfiz 14 hours agoprevWait, isn&#x27;t most of that \"tidal power\" that we would be capturing going into grinding rocks into sand along the coast? reply dools 12 hours agoparentImagine the rock buildup! reply layer8 2 hours agoprevEveryone is commenting on the unreasonable exponential-growth assumption. But regardless of growth, the article is still technically correct that tidal energy is not renewable. reply joelthelion 15 hours agoprevIssues with exponential growth set aside, does wind power suffer from the same problem? If I understand correctly, wind mostly caused by the coriolis force, which is a consequence of the earth&#x27;s rotation. Would building too many wind turbines slow down earth&#x27;s rotation? reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agoparent> If I understand correctly, wind mostly caused by the coriolis force, which is a consequence of the earth&#x27;s rotation.You understand incorrectly. Wind is largely a form of solar energy. The sun heats the earth and its atmosphere at different rates depending on the location, and wind is primarily the result of temperature differentials.The Coriolis effect can definitely affect how wind behaves, but it doesn&#x27;t provide the energy. E.g. a hurricane&#x27;s winds travel in a circle&#x2F;spiral due to the Coriolis effect, but a hurricane is a heat engine that gets its energy from the sun heating the oceans. reply joelthelion 11 hours agorootparentThank you! reply rwoerz 12 hours agoprevLet me nitpick: The headline alone is right: Tidal energy cannot be renewed. But that is true for all renewables like wind and solar, because \"renewable\" is a misnomer. Real renewal would violate thermodynamic&#x27;s 2nd law. What the author actually seems to doubt is the ABUNDANCE of tidal energy (but supports that with questionable assumptions (cf. other comments here)) reply ricardobeat 12 hours agoparentEven then conflating them makes no sense. Solar and wind power are both coming from an external source, the sun, which we might as well consider infinite; whereas tidal energy is not. It can be depleted. reply iamthemonster 11 hours agoprevI really love this kind of thinking and explanation - it may not be correct per se, but it&#x27;s the TYPE of thinking we need.Rather than fluffy repetitions of the slogans of in-groups, it&#x27;s an attempt to explore long term impacts using fundamental scientific principles, none of which are individually too complex.And if we don&#x27;t agree with the 2% annual energy growth rate for 1000 years then that&#x27;s fine, we can fiddle the numbers for what we believe, and the same analysis can be valuable even if it ends up supporting a different conclusion.I&#x27;m interested by the language style as well, it reads like they put it through a filter to generate \"simple English\" as a deliberate choice. reply yalogin 9 hours agoprevThe comment here focus on the exponential growth of energy needs assumed. However that is besides the point, unless I am missing something. If the increase doesn’t happen in 1000, may be 10000. The main point for me is that by using the tidal energy we are slowing down the earth rotation. That just sounds intuitively wrong to me. This energy is already released because of the rotation, how can converting that impact the earth’s rotation? reply avodonosov 10 hours agoprevA related question I think about from time to time. If our energy consumption grows, how soon we will destabilize the Earth?Even 100% clean energy, if infused into the system may increase temperature, or speed up circulation of currents, and other effects.Of course, it&#x27;s not nesessary all energy goes into temperature. Some can be conserved, e.g. as chemicals.But in general, the more energy we have in our disposal, the more potential for damage.We will dig deeper, smelt more ore, etc, etc. reply ggm 11 hours agoprevIs it not the case that the moon-earth system may become locked, irrespective? I mean if we&#x27;re worried about future decades.. As long as this happens before the sun expands to make the earth uninhabitably hot, it&#x27;s a risk for .. some intelligence? reply dbingham 15 hours agoprevCan someone with more experience in the field comment on whether this paper is well founded or off base?The abstract sounds... lets go with \"not completely implausible\" but the assertion that extracting 1% of the Earth&#x27;s energy from the tidal sloshing would slow the earth and tidally lock it in 1000 years feels extreme. Of the extreme assertions require extreme evidence variety. reply c1ccccc1 15 hours agoparentThe post assumes a 2% annual rate of growth in energy consumption. So, due to the nature of exponential functions, most of the energy loss would concentrated towards the end of the 1000 years, as the energy consumption approaches 400 million times present day energy usage. The first two centuries of use would not have a noticeable impact. reply haskmell 15 hours agoprevIf you can slow down the Earth by consuming the tidal energy, can you also speed it up by correctly timing pumping water to reservoirs? reply csours 14 hours agoprevIs this satire? It seems like there&#x27;s too much math in this to be satire. reply luxcem 1 hour agoparentIt seems like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;what-if.xkcd.com&#x2F;, absurd hypothesis and correct maths reply Rantenki 15 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s a neat thought experiment, but the underlying assumption: The world&#x27;s energy consumption was about 5.67x1020 Joules in 2013.[18] This number has increased by more than 2% per year on average in the last 50 years. The average world economic growth rate in the last 50 years is about 3%, which requires a corresponding increase in the energy supply. So, the 2% growth rate for world energy consumption should be a conservative assumption.... is a bit naive. If we&#x27;re consuming (does some math) `1.02^1000 = 398264651` ...Four billion times as much energy as we do today. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much risk of us growing our population to that degree, nor of us being that power hungry if our population stabilizes. We&#x27;ll be either extinct or back to a sustainable agrarian population far before we reach that upper limit. Honestly, if we produced that much power, I suspect we&#x27;d have long since boiled the oceans, making the whole argument moot.TL;DR: Don&#x27;t extrapolate FAR into the future based on a small (relatively) set of data points. reply qayxc 14 hours agoparentNot only that. The paper is only even remotely plausible if the author assumes 100% efficiency. Otherwise waste heat alone would turn Earth into Venus long before any tidal locking could take effect. reply tejtm 14 hours agoprevShort story time https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;ExhalationByTedChiang reply octacat 14 hours agoprevSolar energy is not renewable too in the long run (very long run). reply qayxc 14 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s not what renewable means. Renewable energy means that the source is naturally replenished within a human lifetime. In other words, the source isn&#x27;t permanently depleted by tapping into it.This is the case with solar energy: the Sun&#x27;s energy output doesn&#x27;t change depending on whether we use it or not. Renewable doesn&#x27;t mean perpetual - that&#x27;d be physically impossible for all we know. reply nirse 14 hours agorootparentBut also the sun is burning fuel and eventually that will run out and we don&#x27;t really have any means of renewing that fuel (I don&#x27;t know where to order intergalactic hydrogen). reply octacat 13 hours agorootparentSadly it is not even means of intergalactic hydrogen. The game is over once the hydrogen in the core is fused :( Tidal energy would probably never go mainstream to cause major issues (too easy to break during the storms, not all places are good to build it, other types of energy sources are more attractive).The whole article sounds like something that fuel companies would sponsor to make the renewable energy look bad (look, tidal is not renewable too, so buy our gas&#x2F;oil). reply callalex 15 hours agoprevMore quality science coming out of Stanford as usual. reply josephcsible 15 hours agoprevWhere is the angular momentum going? reply pdonis 15 hours agoparentTo the Moon&#x27;s orbital angular momentum. As the Earth&#x27;s spin slows, the Moon moves further away and its orbital angular momentum increases. reply qayxc 14 hours agorootparentIncidentally, this also causes the tidal effects to weaken to a point where calculations show that tidal locking will actually never happen. reply pdonis 13 hours agorootparentWhat calculations are you referring to? reply changoplatanero 15 hours agoparentprevit goes into pushing the moon&#x27;s orbit further out reply uoaei 15 hours agoprevThen technically neither is wind, since it slows down surface air currents and widens the effective boundary layer of the atmosphere.Technically-technically, no forms of energy \"generation\" (technically just conversion) are 100% efficient so something is always lost to heat. I guess the important question is, what is the net effect in changing that kind of energy into purely thermal energy? reply dredmorbius 12 hours agoparentNo, wind is ultimately fed by solar energy and is driven by differential heating of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and surface.That is, there&#x27;s a constant incoming energy flux. That&#x27;s not to say that there isn&#x27;t some maximum amount of available wind energy, or some maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from wind without causing other effects (even excepting, say, bird strikes and the like).But wind isn&#x27;t \"used up\", there will be more wind tomorrow, so long as the sun shines and there&#x27;s an atmosphere. reply pcthrowaway 8 hours agorootparentBut capturing wind surely creates a local warming effect? I believe I read that somewhere. Enough wind energy could accelerate global warming. reply dredmorbius 8 hours agorootparentThat energy is already present in the environment, as kinetic energy of wind, which will ultimately be reduced to entropic heat. A wind turbine doesn&#x27;t affect that fact, though it may change the location at which the kinetic -> thermal energy transformation occurs.The more likely impact would be of wind turbines removing sufficient energy from wind that thermal transport of the atmosphere itself is disrupted, though this would occur only within an immediate locale and at lower altitudes. Even very high turbines are only about 260 m (850 ft) tall.The mechanism here would be a reduction in the distribution of solar heating within the immediate vicinity, similar to urban heat island effects.And searching as I write this for \"wind turbine heat island\" I find precisely that mechanism described in this paper:Wind plants can also impact local atmospheric conditions through their wakes, characterized by reduced wind speed and increased turbulence. We explore the extent to which the wind plants near an atmospheric measurement site in the central United States have affected their long-term measurements. Both direct observations and mesoscale numerical weather prediction simulations demonstrate how the wind plants induce a wind deficit aloft, especially in stable conditions, and a wind speed acceleration near the surface, which extend ~30 km downwind of the wind plant. Turbulence kinetic energy is significantly enhanced within the wind plant wake in stable conditions, with near-surface observations seeing an increase of more than 30% a few kilometers downwind of the plants.\"Wind plants can impact long-term local atmospheric conditions\", Nicola Bodini, Julie K. Lundquist & Patrick Moriarty, Scientific Reports volume 11, Article number: 22939 (2021)But that&#x27;s not from energy transferred from the wind via the turbine, but of disruption of existing wind flows. reply pcthrowaway 7 hours agorootparentYeah I was specifically considering that reducing the \"windiness\" of an area would increase the temperature> A 2018 study estimated that generating electricity demand with wind power in the United States would warm surface temperatures by 0.24 degrees Celsiushttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instituteforenergyresearch.org&#x2F;renewable&#x2F;wind&#x2F;wi... reply jval43 15 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t wind created by temperature and pressure differentials between regions? How much is due to earth&#x27;s rotation? reply btilly 14 hours agorootparentA lot.Look up Hadley cells. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.seas.harvard.edu&#x2F;climate&#x2F;eli&#x2F;research&#x2F;equable...Warm air rises near the tropics, rotating with the Earth. It then goes towards the temperate zone, still rotating with the Earth to form the jet stream. It then falls, creating the trade winds as it slows down. It then is sucked back towards the tropics, creating a reverse trade wind because it is only going as fast as the temperate zone. And then it rises, completing the cycle.The prevailing wind in both temperate zones and the tropics is therefore due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation. reply dredmorbius 12 hours agorootparentHadley cells determine wind patterns but not the energy content of the wind, to any appreciable degree, which comes from solar flux.Wind energy is solar energy once removed.Wave energy is solar energy twice removed (solar -> wind -> waves). reply btilly 10 hours agorootparentYes, the energy driving the entire system comes from the Sun. But the fact that it takes the form of wind rather than rising&#x2F;falling columns of air has to do with the rotation of the Earth.Ditto for hurricanes. Hurricanes turn rising&#x2F;falling air into cycling air into hurricane force winds because the Earth rotates. But the energy for it came from the Sun. Often removed by another factor, Sun warms ocean, ocean drives the storm. reply dredmorbius 10 hours agorootparentWind is due",

Most likely he just didn&#x27;t give it much thought. reply Nition 11 hours agorootparentWeirdly even commercial software websites seem to do this a lot. Pages of text and some mostly-unrelated images with no screenshots at all.

The AAA Games would need to be done with less scale and no 4k dlss ray tracing whatever. reply MayeulC 14 hours agoparentWhile I agree with the sentiment, and it&#x27;s awesome that a lower-specced version of the game exists...> port [...] to consoles like Xbox originalUuh, in the name of energy efficiency, let&#x27;s not. My smartphone is much more powerful and has a much lower power consumption than these systems. My Steam Deck even more so, though it&#x27;s higher-power than a phone.Targeting energy-efficient, low power hardware should be the goal, not porting to inneficient obsolete HW, IMO (though it&#x27;s pretty cool, and demonstrates that you can do a lot with little computing power).Still, I agree that something that runs well on old commodity hardware can run well on most existing hardware, reducing the need for hardware upgrades.But my point is, running ond old HW is probably counterproductive if you only value ecology. At best, you could emulate old HW with much more efficient modern HW, and integrate most of the system on a single low power chip. reply Whatever13 13 hours agorootparent&#x27;&#x27;running ond old HW is probably counterproductive if you only value ecology&#x27;&#x27; I could be wrong, but i think the opposite than you.You are being reductionist, and only accounting for the factor of direct eletrical consumption during use, and not the total energy and natural resources spent during the equipments lifetime , specially its manufacturing (which i think is the real measure of ecological efficiency we should aim).The old hardware was already produced, resources were spent and pollution and emissions were made, so it is a duty that we should use it as much as possible until irrepairable breakdown happens, and reduce our consumption of new stuff that would only replace it. Like your example of a new smartphone or new steamdeck replacing the old Xbox Original: it is almost certain that the electrical consumption gains would not compensate, in terms of total energy and resources spent and pollution made, the discarting of the original xbox (in fact, it would generate more waste that would need to be reprocessed, generating even more pollution).Remember the 3Rs ? The 1st R is REDUCE, not &#x27;&#x27;replace stuff every 3-5 years to get slightly less eletric consumption&#x27;&#x27;. It is kind of the point of the Permacomputing movement the OP mentioned: perma comes from perma-nent, make computers that last much longer lifespans than the current system. If people could repurpose old PS3s and Xbox for playing indies, and bigger games we demaked to it, people could keep using the stuff and buy less.A Few texts for inspiration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solar.lowtechmagazine.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;how-and-why-i-stop... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iltascabile.com&#x2F;scienze&#x2F;sostenibilita-digitale&#x2F; reply lmm 11 hours agorootparent> Like your example of a new smartphone or new steamdeck replacing the old Xbox Original: it is almost certain that the electrical consumption gains would not compensate, in terms of total energy and resources spent and pollution made, the discarting of the original xboxCitation needed.

Sure, a game engine will magically pump out your game for different backends but even supporting Vulkan and Metal results in much gnawing and mashing of teeth (and a lack of games on Apple hardware).Then there is the developer ergonomics. I know that I hate having to write code to maintain compatibility for even 5 year old standards. Each GPU and game engine is also a unique clusterfuck of incompatibility and subtle bugs that crash the shit out of games. If you want to support that old hardware, you will need to test on the actual hardware.

I was having some problems with fingers of my hand going numb so the orthopedic surgeon sent me for a procedure she said would be \"unfortunately pretty unpleasant\" called a \"nerve conduction study\" with an eminent London professor to try to diagnose the problem.When the day came the dude showed up with a laptop attached to a small box and a number of leads. I said to him[1] \"hey there, I&#x27;m an engineer, would you mind telling me how this study works\" and he (delighted) explained to me that although his title was a professor of neurology he was actually a biomedical engineer and the procedure was hooking me up to an oscilloscope and sending currents down the various nerves of my arm to see whether (or not) they were detectable on the oscilloscope and therefore being conducted properly down the nerves. So I spent 30mins or so having various electric shocks applied to my arm and looking at the pictures on the (very fancy) oscilloscope while shooting the breeze about medical imaging and machine learning with this professor.The procedure was mildly unpleasant but super-interesting as a result.[1] Sort of as a coping strategy because I expected it to be painful. reply matt_j 2 hours agoparentI had a nerve conduction test on my arm, it was pretty neat! I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable, just a bit of a tingle.My issue was a combination of a previous shoulder injury and bad sleeping position and bad sitting at desk position (resting forearm on the edge) that would result in numbness in my hand and fingers.I&#x27;m more conscious of how I sit and sleep now (as much as you can be \"conscious\" of how you sleep!) and I started indoor rock climbing which has really transformed my upper body in terms of arm, shoulder and back strength and mobility. Funny, I don&#x27;t look any different, but I can hold onto and hang off things well good. :P reply wmwmwm 2 hours agorootparentI had one due to a bulging disc in my neck and some pins and needles - it was fascinating, but I still remember them turning on the audio and letting me listen to my nerves trying to flex various muscles! My biceps sounded like a bit like white noise (good), while my triceps sounded like a plastic bag flapping outside a car window (bad!) The way they explained it some subset of my tricep nerves were firing harder to try and compensate for the ones affected by the disc bulge - but they couldn’t keep up the firing rate by themselves. Really interesting and somewhat explained my mediocre push-up performance! reply pjc50 3 hours agoparentprevThe biomedical equivalent of poking you with a multimeter conductivity tester that goes \"beep\". reply stavros 2 hours agorootparentI really hope someone had a sense of humor and made that oscilloscope beep on detecting a connection. reply ComodoHacker 2 hours agorootparentYou joke but there&#x27;s a whole branch of fake science built on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quackwatch.org&#x2F;related&#x2F;electro&#x2F; reply ozgung 3 hours agoparentprevThis sounds like Electromyography (EMG). A pretty common technique in Neurology to diagnose problems in nerves and muscles.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electromyography reply supermatt 2 hours agorootparentThey are different, but often done together. EMG measures electrical activity of the muscles and their connection to the nerves, and NCS measures (unsurprisingly) the conductivity of the nerves reply jacquesm 3 hours agoparentprevIs your problem resolved? Did you find the cause? I&#x27;ve found that when I bike long distances that no matter what the weather is I have to wear thick padded gloves so that I don&#x27;t end up with numb fingers for days afterwards. reply seanhunter 2 hours agorootparentYes. We did find the cause and my problem is almost completely resolved by physiotherapy exercises. It took a few weeks to sort itself out and if I am not careful it starts coming back but it&#x27;s mostly gone.Long version in case this helps someone: I have hypermobile-type Ehlers-Danloss syndrome, which is a disorder affecting the body&#x27;s connective tissue. Among other things it means I&#x27;m more bendy than I should be. As a consequence I have to be careful not to make too extreme movements because I can injure my joints. In this case, the problem was because I wasn&#x27;t utilizing my full range of movement, my nerves were essentially getting stuck in various places where they travel through small gaps or over tendons or whatnot. The solution is to do (gentle) stretching-type exercises which are designed to make the tendons do their full range of movement (I have to do this carefully so as not to hyperextend and injure myself), which causes the nerve to be pulled through these gaps and unstick itself. Because this process is like floss being drawn through a gap between teeth, the exercises are actually called \"flossing\" by physiosHere&#x27;s an example specifically in the domain of sciatica, although that&#x27;s not what I do[1][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicalnewstoday.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nerve-flossing#exe... reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentWow, that&#x27;s quite the story. Great to see you managed to both identify and fix it in such a non-invasive manner. reply webmobdev 58 minutes agorootparentprevI was told by a physiotherapist doing his Phd that if everybody did Tai Chi and indian Yoga he would be jobless - Tai Chi helps with \"stretching\" the nerves and Yoga does the same with muscles. (Your nerve flossing description was very insightful and helped me better understand the process). reply seanhunter 26 minutes agorootparentYes. I did actually do Tai Chi quite seriously some years ago and starting to do some of my old Chi Gung exercises has been very helpful in this recovery process. I have to be quite careful with yoga because of the hypermobility - because extreme stretching can cause me problems. reply matsemann 2 hours agorootparentprevHave you looked into a bike fit? It&#x27;s quite a common problem, and setting up your bike differently could help you relieve some pressure at hot spots. For instance shortening the stem could give you a more upright position and less weight on your arms. A wider or narrower handlebar could alter the angle of your wrists (on a road bike). Etc. etc., many things to look into, depending on what the cause is. reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentYes, I worked in a bike store and have access to all the right measuring tools. The fit itself isn&#x27;t so much the problem as the inevitable areas where my hands contact the handlebars. My grip is too tight so that&#x27;s why the padding helps as much as it does, it is much softer than the material that the handlebars are covered with. On warm days it isn&#x27;t perfect though (because it also covers parts of my hands that I&#x27;d rather have exposed on warm days) and I&#x27;ve been looking at getting softer coverings for the handlebars to help with that. I&#x27;ve already changed a lot about the geometry of that particular bike to improve matters substantially, this is the one remaining bit. reply MezzoDelCammin 1 hour agorootparentprevsecond the \"check Your bike fit\". In my opinion, the checklist is:1. check the bike fit (probably the main problem)2. add some mobility &#x2F; core training (at some point if You bike long distance out of the blue without much training, some bits in Your body will simply break &#x2F; strain no matter how good Your bike fit is)3. in case of problems, look up the terms \"cyclist palsy\" and \"ulnar &#x2F; median nerve flossing exercises\". It should help recover a bit quicker.All that being said, I&#x27;m typing this with a pretty severely tingling median nerves in both hands. 1200km in 86h without much training during the season and with an improperly adjusted saddle (didn&#x27;t mark the position before packing the bike for transport). Yeah, do as I say, not as I do. reply epse 3 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think your issue is super uncommon, I experience it myself, as does most of my family.

These symptoms did appear relatively shortly after doing a lot of work with a light industrial jackhammer to remove tiles from an old bathroom. There may well be a connection. But that was a one off and since then it appears when doing > 100 km in a day or so on the bike. I thought it was circulation related, never even thought about vibration. Thank you. reply the_gipsy 2 hours agorootparentYour symptoms are common in motorcycling too. The remedy is to loosen the grip, which is advised anyway for smoother and safer driving. \"As if you were steering just with your index finger and thumb&#x27;s tips\". reply stavros 2 hours agorootparentHm, why is that safer? reply the_gipsy 1 hour agorootparentForcing the front wheel \"against its will\" is gonna make it lose its grip or make the whole bike unstable when turning. reply jacquesm 9 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s the worst when you have people sitting on the back that go against the natural lean of the bike. stavros 1 hour agorootparentprevI hadn&#x27;t thought of that, thanks. You do steer with the torso, after all. reply closewith 2 hours agorootparentprev> But that was a one off and since then it appears when doing > 100 km in a day or so on the bike.Unfortunately vibration-induced Raynaud&#x27;s syndrome has no cure, so it may be continuing to affect you.I also have Raynaud&#x27;s which affects me when cycling or when using an outboard throttle for extended periods. Apart from hand exercises which delays onset of symptoms, there&#x27;s apparently nothing to be done. reply tpm 2 hours agorootparentprevThick gloves are ok but uncomfortable in hot weather - there are also ergonomic grips (eg from Ergon, SQLab) and gel pads that can be fitted over&#x2F;under the grip tape that can be used instead. Also various ways to directly reduce handlebar vibrations (like the Cane Creek eeSilk stem). reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentYes, that&#x27;s precisely what I&#x27;ve found, it works well but not when it&#x27;s hot out and this summer has been particularly nasty in that sense.I&#x27;m looking at a pair of leather-over-foam paddings integrated with the grips themselves like I have on a tandem where I noticed I don&#x27;t have that problem. But that particular model has proven hard to find. reply darkclouds 21 minutes agoparentprevHistidine helps remyelinate the nervous system.

The long and short of it was that I should stop leaning on my elbows on the desk, because that can damage the nerves that run across your elbow. Made a conscious effort to avoid doing that for a while and the damage fixes itself.I hope you have the same problem I did, was an easy fix. reply teuobk 7 hours agoprevI was one of the Kickstarter backers of this, with my purchase&#x2F;commitment happening on October 19, 2013.Gabe (the guy making the oscilloscope watch) sent updates every few days for the first month or so, then roughly monthly into 2014, then a few times in 2015, then a pause, and then a few updates in late 2018 and early 2019. After that, it was radio silence for over four years until July 30th of this year, announcing that the devices were actually going to ship.To say I never expected to actually get the watch after, say, 2015 would understate things considerably.

You could well lose your money. reply wkat4242 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not an obligation-free playground for tinkerers either though. reply jacquesm 5 hours agorootparentThat is more or less exactly what it is, if you tell yourself you have rights after backing a Kickstarter then you are doing it wrong. That&#x27;s why you are called a backer and not a buyer. It&#x27;s interesting that someone would back a thing without actually knowing what kind of relationship they are entering in.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;kickstarter-is-not-a-storehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;rules?ref=global-footerSo, within the rules: it is &#x27;an obligation-free playground for tinkerers&#x27; more than it is a place where you can buy cool stuff that doesn&#x27;t exist yet.And in this particular case it worked exactly as it should. Obviously there are some Kickstarters that are fraudulent, where the initiator has no intention up front to ever release what they say they intend to build. But those are indistinguishable from your typical other failed Kickstarter, the one where the ability or funds did not reach far enough to stretch to the point where something tangible got delivered.If you want to be 100% sure you get what you back: don&#x27;t use Kickstarter, you will almost certainly be disappointed. If you want to back people that have the intention of doing interesting things with low expectations of actually receiving that which you back Kickstarter is fine.A very strict reading of the rules means that Kickstarter can be exactly that: an obligation-free playground for tinkerers, who may at some point deliver something back to you in return for the money you give them. Your &#x27;backing&#x27; is essentially a donation, there is a pinky promise that the recipient will try to do what they can to deliver on their intentions.Some projects are more up-front about this than others, but in general it helps to understand the kind of arrangement you are entering into before deciding to back any kind of project.This is the project page for this watch:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;920064946&#x2F;oscilloscope-...The timetable seems - to the hardware oriented part of my brain - wildly optimistic. Otoh 10 years is probably much longer than the original project was intended to run, likely there were serious troubles sourcing parts and&#x2F;or with the final design. But the person behind the project felt that in spite of that headwind they still were obliged to deliver, even if that happened much, much later than intended. I wished all Kickstarters would end as happy as this one.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.kickstarter.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;115005048113-...So: other than a &#x27;gentle-mans agreement&#x27; you do not have much to go on in terms of rights. Finally: the amount of money raised for this project is so low that I&#x27;m surprised it managed to run to completion at all. reply Guvante 4 hours agorootparentYou are entering a legally binding contract with the seller. They must oblige or else refund you.Now of course anyone with any smarts runs a Kickstarter through an LLC to avoid being liable but it isn&#x27;t a completely free space.Think of it like preordering from a local store. If they go bankrupt you are SOL.Kickstarter just isn&#x27;t the one taking on the risk in contrast to, say, buying from a random merchant on Amazon works. Where Amazon guarantees completion (as well as it is willing to).Now if a nationwide Kickstarter runs and fails is the original developer&#x27;s LLC impossible to sue if they don&#x27;t deliver as long as they take reasonable steps towards delivery? 100%.But again there is a difference between a contract with a random and a playground. reply jacquesm 3 hours agorootparent> You are entering a legally binding contract with the seller.

When you back a project on Kickstarter, you’re helping create something new — not pre-ordering something that already exists. As Kickstarter does not offer refunds, we encourage backers to investigate the project idea first, to vet the creator thoroughly, and to assess the inherent risk of the project for themselves before making a pledge.There’s always a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised. \"And that&#x27;s from the current terms of service, the previous ones (which were in effect when this project launched) were even more lenient.

Project Creators agree to make a good faith attempt to fulfill each reward by its Estimated Delivery DateThe point of this site is to gather enough money to make a good faith attempt at something. That&#x27;s pretty obvious. Even an LLM can figure that out. reply verve_rat 2 hours agorootparentprevI mean, they can say whatever they want on the site, but the real question is: what does the legislation, regulation, and common law say about this?Has anyone successfully sued a project?

In fact on the UHK, there is no \"caps lock\" key, it reads \"mouse\". reply Jedd 6 hours agorootparentHardcore vim users use ctrl-[ instead. : )Despite being two keypresses, this is usually faster to type, or at the least to return to home position from, and those keys are probably more consistently placed than the ESC key between vendors &#x2F; models. reply rgoulter 5 hours agorootparentIf you use \"home row modifiers\" (holding down f&#x2F;d&#x2F;s&#x2F;a or j&#x2F;k&#x2F;l&#x2F;; acts as Shift&#x2F;Ctrl&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Alt), then it&#x27;s less reaching for ctrl.Although I&#x27;d also recommend making Esc available on a thumb cluster. reply Titan2189 9 hours agorootparentprevOh whow. Thanks for pointing that out. I am so confused, \"Ultimate hacking keyboard\" implies for me that you&#x27;re a hardcore vim user. How can this have been developed without an ESC key? reply roel_v 1 hour agorootparentI have the top left button without modifiers remapped to esc, it&#x27;s no problem at all. All your muscle memory works just fine, no retraining needed (UHK since 2018&#x2F;2019, on of the first batches, and Vim user since late 1990&#x27;s). reply dm319 2 hours agorootparentprevThe usual position of the esc key is terrible ergonomically for vim users, but then vim was not designed for the IBM model M keyboard. reply talldrinkofwhat 7 hours agorootparentprevescape is mapped to thumb-hold + tilde. Your hand already opens up to push esc, so it&#x27;s not even an inconvenience in my workflow.The function keys are a bit more of a pain, but once again it&#x27;s a thumb press + number (1->F1 etc). I&#x27;m more inconvenienced by eclipse and visual studio not having the same button for debug-step-over than actually pushing the thing. reply terinjokes 8 hours agorootparentprevYou get the \"key cluster\" module and put it under your left thumb, as is common in other split keyboards. reply OJFord 8 hours agorootparentprevHow many &#x27;hardcore vim users&#x27; use the actual physical Esc key for that (back to normal) purpose anyway? It&#x27;s so awkwardly positioned I thought that was often among one&#x27;s first bindings.(I don&#x27;t have a UHK and though I looked before I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me, just saying.) reply nojs 8 hours agorootparentAs a “hardcore vim user” I need it pretty regularly on fresh servers for example reply OJFord 5 hours agorootparentCaps lock is a common one for example, and would require an OS-level binding, so remote use fresh or not would work fine, it&#x27;d see the same key code as &#x27;real&#x27; Esc. reply nojs 4 hours agorootparentTrue, I have caps lock mapped to control.

Maybe look at a picture of an oscilloscope while you do it.If you take all the critical chips out of an oscilloscope, remove the silicon dice from their encapsulation, you still take up more area than any smartwatch. Just the main processor is typically larger than an Apple watch. On top of that you need 1-2 ADC chips of a similar size, several hundred MB of RAM chips, a ton of discrete components that form the very sensitive frontend, then you also need a battery and a display, ports, and mounting hardware.This is like saying Intel has been selling i7 processors for decades, so they should be able to pack it into a watch.Packing an oscilloscope into a watch is several orders of magnitude more complex than you seem to think. Oscilloscopes of any configuration are many orders of magnitude more complex than you imply here. reply Aurornis 5 minutes agorootparent> you still take up more area than any smartwatch. Just the main processor is typically larger than an Apple watch. On top of that you need 1-2 ADC chips of a similar size, several hundred MB of RAM chips,I think you’re overestimating the functionality of this smartwatch.They didn’t really make a full oscilloscope with hundreds of megabytes of RAM and high sample rates and many effective bits of precision.They just used a microcontroller with a built-in ADC and exposed those ADC inputs with some input protection and filtering. Yes it’s more than a watch, but making a simple oscilloscope out of a micro with an ADC is a relatively simple EE project. It’s often done as a small project for EE students.The real challenge was making a UI, packaging it, and shipping a hardware project to a small number of people. reply tonmoy 8 hours agorootparentprevApple made devices in other form factors for decades before being able to market the Apple Watch. reply greggsy 8 hours agorootparentprevThey weren’t in a wrist watch format though reply m3kw9 9 hours agoprevPretty much wait till electronics advance enough to have these off the shelf oscilloscope-in-a-chip. reply edrxty 7 hours agoparentXilinx RFSoC is is essentially that.

But the primary mode of operation is voltage rather than current. It’s a bit like saying a thermometer is used to measure altitude. reply jacquesm 3 hours agorootparentNo, not quite. It is actually impossible to measure a voltage without any current flow, ever so slight but it is always there. It is perfectly possible to measure temperature and altitude entirely independently of each other. reply jtwaleson 3 hours agorootparentMy grasp on electricity is elementary, but as I understand it: measuring current in a circuit with a scope is always done via a conversion to a voltage, because that is what the scope is designed to measure. So the current is always derived from a measured voltage.With my silly thermometer example I meant: you can boil water, measure the temperature and derive the atmospheric pressure and altitude. Should have probably worded that clearer.Edit: and yes I understand what you are saying. Internally the scope measures voltage using the current that’s flowing across something with a very high resistance. reply jacquesm 3 hours agorootparentNo problem, first coffee still has to kick in :)And good morning to you. replya-dub 4 hours agoprevkickstarter is skymall for the daring... reply anonzzzies 1 hour agoprevHa!

This reminds me of those 3D printed computer mice that cost a hundred dollars. They didn&#x27;t bother with polyurethane casting nor did they bother with getting a high quality 3D printer... The thing is, 3D printing is so slow that even a manual process like polyurethane casting is faster and every mold is a \"3d printer\" in its own right so you could be making hundreds of parts in an eight hour shift as opposed to a single one. reply Titan2189 9 hours agoparentprevYeah, that was my first thought.

Every time he hears a plane engine sound, he starts looking up. The moment he spots it, he usually points his finger at it, and says something like “Hmm!” or “Pane!” So since he likes them so much, and I know that plane positions are publicly available data, I figured it’d be a fun Sunday hack to make a script that gives us an alert every time a plane is overhead, so we can run out and find it. It’s Sunday afternoon, I changed his diaper, handed him to his mother for a nap, and opened my laptop at 12:10 pm. I fired up ChatGPT, and asked “I want to build a tool that sends me a notification when a flight is visible above my house. Help me build this in NodeJS.” Instantly, a NodeJS code was returned, complete with the proper API call, distance calculation function and notification system. Here it is for the nerds: I entered my longitude/latitude, executed it, expecting the API call to most likely break, and to my pleasant surprise, it worked right away, alerting me of a plane nearby. I looked at the time: 12:12 pm. It’s not even been 2 minutes, and I have a functional prototype of what was in my head. We live in WILD times. Now, I could have done this myself, find the proper API, figure out how its response is structured, and calculate the distance between each response and my position. But this would have taken me 30 minutes. Instead, I got it done 30x faster. And then, I thought: this is fun, let’s make it available from any device. So I asked: Turn it all into a web app that people can enter their position longitude/latitude (or geolocate with the browser), radius, and then start getting temporary notification on page + sound with speech. I want it to be fully frontend. And it must be one HTML file, no dependencies. This is what it returned Pretty good for a first try! It’s ugly, but it works. 20 min later and after asking it to use modern design standards, come up with a name, and create more responsiveness in the interface, I ended up with this: Here’s the link: https://planespotter.pages.dev (If nothing shows up - there is no flight over head - or you might need to increase the radius. Probably works best on desktop too). Now, I don’t expect many of you to care about such a tool. But I thought it was such an excellent example of how technology is making our ideas turn into reality faster. The edge is increasingly being placed not on your ability to perform the repetitive task, but on having the creative insight that is at the origin of new powerful ideas. ChatGPT is great at executing, but it’s not so great at coming up with new ideas. A human connected to a path of authenticity is in prime position to receive treasures from the muses of creativity. And increasingly it’s going to be that ability to have the original insight, coupled with the capacity to communicate it clearly to the machine that is going to make the greatest difference. We’re essentially moving away from “raw” repetitive physical, and towards something akin to an “ethereal” creative labor. What I mean is that we’re getting very close already to a situation where you envision a whole new idea, and can manifest it within a minute. Imagine envisioning Airbnb, and having its whole frontend and backend done within 1 minute. We’re not there yet, but we could be there soon. It could even figure out acquisition channels and start running self-evolving ads, or pivot on its own based on conversion rates. This is where my curiosity goes: I wonder if as our machines get really smart, we’ll end up meditating in front of our computers, to try and figure out the most innovative and articulate query. In a world where most of the “work” can be executed instantly, it’s no longer about the work, it’s about the mental clarity necessary to enter the right query - and that, is the domain of mindfulness. Curious times. PS: If you want to use ChatGPT to improve your mindfulness, check out SageGPT. I’ve trained GPT on Taoist wisdom, and packaged it into a WhatsApp bot.

The only interesting thing here is that it managed to convince this person that \"they built\" anything. Also it seems there are tons of blogs about this exact task. I guess it&#x27;s slightly interesting that there now exists a way to find example code snippets besides Google, but it&#x27;s funny that the supposed insight here is that the important thing is implementation of novel ideas when that&#x27;s exactly the opposite of what has been demonstrated reply version_five 18 hours agorootparentOutside of any attribution issues, I think it&#x27;s a cool capability to be able to get a concise how-to vs having to search for and read a blog. I&#x27;ve asked chatgpt for recipes, I know I could find them online and that neither I nor gpt are inventing anything, getting a concise reply is just the most convenient format. reply nvarsj 21 hours agoparentprevExactly… likely copy pasted from someone’s github repo with 0 attribution. A brave new world… reply louison11 18 hours agorootparentOP here. I think it&#x27;s a bit reductive to think that GPT simply copy pastes. It sometimes does. But my experience working with it nearly daily since December, is that it&#x27;s also quite capable at reasoning. My sense is it most likely saw the API endpoint in another context, learned how it was parsed, and then adapted it to my situation. Perhaps it even parsed the documentation page itself. reply nvarsj 16 hours agorootparentSince attribution isn&#x27;t possible in ChatGPT, we&#x27;ll never know. It&#x27;s a great way to avoid all IP claims via plausible deniability.This topic has been beaten to death though, and it isn&#x27;t changing. Companies have little incentive to have explainable AI since it would open them to infringement claims. reply SushiHippie 20 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;konstantintzt&#x2F;planetracker&#x2F;blob&#x2F;9a1f407cb...At least this person does not fetch all planes and then iterate over all of them but sets boundaries in which area to get all the planes. reply tleb_ 18 hours agorootparentBoth the GitHub project you linked to and the webpage in the posted article use a bounding box; has the webpage changed in the last two hours? reply louison11 15 hours agorootparentNo it hasn’t. ChatGPT from the get go used a bounding box. There is no way you could query all planes on Earth in one query on a free API reply viraptor 20 hours agoprevThis works better for some languages then others. I tried something similar for Swift since I wanted a simple tool for MacOS. The process was not great, many methods were hallucinated, and the answers matched old&#x2F;deprecated functions from previous Swift versions. The experience seems to scale comparably to what&#x27;s available in stackoverflow. reply dahart 19 hours agoparentA friend of mine was trying to show me how surprisingly good ChatGPT is, and sent me an example prompt and response that produced working code. Just to check, I entered the prompt into Google and got back the StackOverflow page with verbatim the same complete block of code. It was even the first Google hit. The only thing ChatGPT had done was copy something easily findable on the web and scrub away the attribution, license, and source information. reply hyperpape 18 hours agorootparent\"It&#x27;s faster&#x2F;less of a pain to ask the bot than to use StackOverflow\" is a significant portion of what I use ChatGPT for. Sometimes, it&#x27;s just a better search engine.I recognize that there are questions about how that works in the longer-term, but for now, it&#x27;s useful. reply ofjcihen 17 hours agorootparentMaybe in some cases, but I’ve found the context of the original answer to be important.Usually the original answer has some responses attached either clarifying something important or outlining why this approach is bad and linking to a better answer.With GPT you only get one answer Saïd with complete confidence. reply Brystephor 18 hours agorootparentprevEven if all chatgpt did was save you two clicks per search, and maybe saved the time spent highlighting the portion that needs to be copied, isn&#x27;t that still valuable? reply dahart 16 hours agorootparentIn this particular case it didn’t save any clicks or do any highlighting that StackOverflow hadn’t already done. But even if it did save a little effort or time, which I could generally agree might have some value, I suspect it’s myopic to focus solely on the search effort. We lose something more important when AI inserts itself as the search engine; it prevents the searchers and the authors from having a conversation. Authors don’t get feedback, searchers can’t ask questions or follow up or seek out unrelated information from particularly knowledgeable or inspiring authors. I do want search to help me get to relevant and quality info, to sift out the things I wasn’t asking about, but I don’t want to trade my ability to interact with people for that or especially for slightly fewer mouse events. I’m also concerned about what happens when this starts to commodify after convincing people AI search is easier&#x2F;faster… when ads and financial interests are allowed to guide the results — and that will happen — will it end up eventually being worse or harder to get true or relevant search results compared to StackOverflow or Google? Where do you go when the results don’t tell you where the information came from? reply GeoAtreides 18 hours agorootparentprevRemoving the attribution is a major negative, as it removes the incentive to contribute to stackoverflow. People are willing to do a lot of work for free, provided they can get credit for it. reply allenu 17 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re right that it does hallucinate a lot when it comes to MacOS API. I find that the hit rate is good enough to ask ChatGPT first, however, before diving deep into Apple documentation.It&#x27;s saved me quite a bit of time in terms of understanding how to use APIs as a client. I find the API docs that Apple provides are so bare bones and don&#x27;t illustrate how the APIs are meant to be used, and you really have to search around for example projects or That One WWDC Video Where All Is Revealed.

Flight RZO134...TAP1369 (ICAO) is TP1369 (IATA); similar for TAP1691 (ICAO) and TP1691 (IATA). But TAP23NP (ICAO) is TP1823 (IATA) and RZO134 (ICAO) is S4 134 (IATA). What&#x27;s broadcast in ADS-B is very often very different from what&#x27;s shown at the airport and not what someone would recognize.Doing this mapping is a pain. The OP is using OpenSky Network who say:callsignThis column contains the callsign that was broadcast by the aircraft. Most airlines indicate the airline and the flight number in the callsign, but there is no unified system. In our example, the callsign indicates that this state vector belongs to UPS flight 858. By looking up the flightnumber on services like flightaware.com, you’ll find out that this flight goes from Lousville to Phoenix every day.i.e. go look this data up elsewhere.I asked ChatGPT:Write me some JavaScript that can map an ICAO callsign broadcast by ADS-B to an IATA flight number for the same flight.Mapping an ICAO callsign broadcast by ADS-B to an IATA flight number is a complex task that typically requires access to a comprehensive aviation database.

Between January and May, I got maybe 25 minutes a day on the machine. The most impressive thing I could get it to do was play checkers at a level that a four year old could consistently beat. I orchestrated maybe, a couple thousand moving bits of logic to do that. It was all trivial. My reaction might well have been, \"you can&#x27;t do anything valuable with this computer programming thing.\" After all, I couldn&#x27;t get it to do anything. My actual reaction was \"WOW! Think what we can do with this.\"Fifty years later I was directing construction of systems of systems that could remove a tumour from a little girl&#x27;s brain by taking 2D X-Ray images, reconstructing them as 3D density maps, identifying the organs in those maps, identifying the tumour in those maps, computing the best way to align proton beams in order to irradiate just the tumours, and then position the patient and beams, operate the accelerator to generate the protons and zap the tumour. It involved, literally, billions of logic statements - every one of which was trivial in its own context. Spacetime is also flat, everywhere, at the right scale. But we could orchestrate those billions of mathematical and logical trivialities into something very nontrivial because of huge productivity gains in producing them and stringing them together during my lifetime.

Or perhaps you need to understand a problem from different perspectives, or research whether something similar exists in a different domain.Aristotle, Euclid, Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin, Tesla, Edison, Turing, Einstein... not one of them had an entire solution to a hard problem revealed in a single gulp. Every single one of them took small iterative steps and needed to break a problem down and approach each part of it as an individual problem in its own right.You might be doing an experiment nobody has ever done before to test a hypothesis that nobody has ever considered in human history, but LLMs can still help you determine if the hypothesis is framed correctly, understand if your experiment has parallels elsewhere in the knowledge its exposed to, research how to validate your results, and help you with a ton of other small mundane tasks needed to do good science. Doesn&#x27;t make it a scientist, just makes itself useful to scientists.Likewise, you might not know how to write a Phoenix LiveView application to predict in-play odds of your favourite sports team and identify value in online sports books (trust me, this is a hard problem), but it can help break that down into the individual pieces, let you get started with small utility functions that you can build on, and work with you to make you more productive.

They seem quite impossible to solve until you try a bunch of things, sometimes for years&#x2F;decades, throwing stuff at the wall, and you hope you get lucky.

If I&#x27;m learning something with little or no prior knowledge, I&#x27;m in the worst possible position to question what I&#x27;m being taught, and those numbers mean it&#x27;s going to routinely make mistakes.(b) If these numbers stay in the same ballpark, it&#x27;s impossible to compose tasks. (80%) ^ 10 ~= 10%. Make that 95%, (95%) ^ 10 ~= 59%. Unless we see a 3 order of magnitude improvement in the error rate, interactive usage constantly supervised by an expert is the only possible way to use this technology.(c) Even if it&#x27;s something I know very well, is basic enough that the model can reasonably do, and not critical enough that an error will be catastrophic, a 20% error rate means I have to keep my eyes wide open.Unless we see fundamentally new developments, it&#x27;s a nice to have, but not a game changer.

I suspect that the first team will still end up doing pretty well, whereas the latter will get more terrible. So one outcome might be a greater delta between teams these two types of teams, with the takeaway being that in the new AI world, practices around code testing and reviewing are more important than ever. reply avereveard 19 hours agoparentprevYeah.

I hate the weird wide-eyed fanaticism with which people approach this stuff and how people will reach for ChatGPT before they reach for actual documentation.But even if its expertise mainly opens the door to trivial stuff, that alone is a huge boon for accessibility for a lot of folks.> I spent a month with an LLM and build a new programming languageFor the past few months I&#x27;ve more or less been doing this. I&#x27;m self-taught, so my CS knowledge is sketchy and has lots of holes. I never took a compilers or programming languages course. I&#x27;ve done lots of reading but it never fully clicked for me. Having an LLM outline the process for me at a high level, provide pseudocode or even code snippets for less clear bits, and also (try to) answer whatever questions I throw at it related to my external reading has been pretty incredible -- things suddenly clicked. Another way I use it is to ask for important introductory texts or papers when exploring a new areaYes, occasionally it spouts nonsense -- you have to evaluate its responses critically. If you ask it to do anything complicated or involving fast-moving APIs or less well known languages or frameworks, it will straight up make shit up. But we shouldn&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bathwater hereA snippet of a conversation from earlier this summer:Me In Pierce&#x27;s types and programming languages, he describes the untyped arithmetic expression language. In one of the definitions by inference rules, he defines the language as the minimal set T such that - 0 is in T, true is in T, and false is in T - If t is in T, then succ(t) in T - pred(t) is in T, and iszero(t) is in T. That makes sense if t is numeric but how are these defined if t is Boolean? For example, true is in T, but I don&#x27;t see how this definition can work if T is to also allow boolean values, like how is succ(true) well-defined?GPT In Pierce&#x27;s presentation in \"Types and Programming Languages\", the untyped arithmetic language allows you to form terms like succ(true), even though they don&#x27;t have a meaningful interpretation in \"everyday arithmetic\". When we say the term succ(t) is in T, we&#x27;re referring to the syntactic formation of terms, not their semantic meaning. The language defines the syntax of valid terms, but it doesn&#x27;t give them any inherent meaning at this stage. This is why we can syntactically form terms that don&#x27;t make sense semantically. When we actually evaluate these terms (if we were to interpret them), many of them would result in \"stuck\" states, where we can&#x27;t proceed with evaluation. For example, while we can form the term succ(true), there&#x27;s no evaluation rule that tells us what this term evaluates to. The definition you cited doesn&#x27;t discriminate based on the nature of t. All it says is: if t is a term in T, then succ(t), pred(t), and iszero(t) are also terms in T. Remember, this untyped language serves as a stepping stone. It illustrates what can go wrong without types. The oddities you&#x27;re pointing out motivate the introduction of more refined, typed systems later in the book, where such nonsensical combinations are explicitly prohibited by the type system. reply romanovcode 20 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not about building a product, it&#x27;s about saving time by making it do small task 30x faster than yourself (just like author did). Not all tasks, but many many menial tasks.At least that&#x27;s how I use it and I&#x27;m super happy with what it gives me. reply dmje 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s exactly right. Any product is essentially made up of a gazillion small tasks, whether setting up a framework or writing a database query. If just some of those small tasks can be made quicker &#x2F; easier using these tools, then why not?What I find most useful in this space is twofold:1. Specificity: so yeh, I can look at SO or wherever and see responses to a semi-specific query, say about querying a database. And yes, I could post a question and maybe after a few hours if I&#x27;m lucky get a response. But with ChatGPT I can throw in the actual table and column names and get a specific response back. Most often it needs honing, sure, but it&#x27;s most often a great starting point.2. Being able to back-query. So the fact that history is maintained means I can say \"actually, add in a column called X and can you make sure that the query only returns unique IDs\" and - again - I&#x27;ll get an immediate response without having to go all the way back through the questioning journey again.As with any tool, the extreme responses on either end seem obviously flawed. On the one hand: no, it&#x27;s not going to replace all developer jobs. On the other, to just completely ignore it, not try it, always assume that \"the documentation\" is better - this seems blinkered and foolish too. Somewhere in the middle is a sweet spot where human brains collide with these tools and we manage to tease out code that is more quickly researched and saves time but also well considered and treated with a degree of healthy scepticism before deployment. reply taude 20 hours agorootparentprevAgree with this, not sure why the parent of this thread thinks you&#x27;d use it to output a full business.

So ask it to something in C&#x2F;Python&#x2F;etc... you get better results than for F# or ObjectiveC or ActionScript.When I ask GPT4 questions about Python, it is almost like talking to a pretty knowledgeable person. It offers opinions on best ways and eve no what NOT to do. reply xkcd1963 20 hours agoprevI tried to use it for my work but I always need too specific things. It can save me some clicks on google but often google is still more useful. reply noman-land 21 hours agoprevFor me the main thing I&#x27;ve gained from ChatGPT (3.5) is I no longer dread that wall of lack of knowledge. Where you know so little you don&#x27;t even know where to start and the task seems dreadful and insurmountable. Just a couple questions later you&#x27;ve got an intro, some jargon, some sample code. It makes it much easier to put the pieces together and ask followup questions. reply Cannabat 20 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s seriously empowering. I&#x27;ve found it to provide excellent broad strokes for topics where there are well-established best practices. In these cases, where the training data would have had numerous data that all said the same thing, you can be pretty darn sure it is not leading you astray. reply simias 20 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t tried ChatGPT for coding yet but I have used it to study human languages (I&#x27;ve been studying Japanese for a little while) and it&#x27;s so easy to get it to spew complete nonsense with perfect aplomb that it makes me super wary of using it for any \"serious\" things. In particular anything you&#x27;re not super familiar with where you can&#x27;t easily evaluate if the output is correct or not.The other day I was struggling to parse a Japanese sentence, a particular grammatical construction made no sense to me. I wrote the sentence in ChatGPT, asked it to break it down for me, and it came up with a plausible-sounding explanation. Problem was, I couldn&#x27;t find any hit on google when I searched for the thing it was talking about. So I asked ChatGPT to give me more details, tell me what I could search for, and it would insist that its explanation was correct and then gaslight me by telling me that the reason I couldn&#x27;t find anything on Google was because it was a niche subject not usually taught in grammar books.After some more searching around and double-checking it turns out that I had misread a kanji and the sentence I typed into ChatGPT was complete gibberish as a result. ChatGPT&#x27;s explanation, while sounding very plausible, was complete fabrication.The idea that some inexperienced people are shipping software using this tool is insane to me. reply gertlex 19 hours agorootparent> The idea that some inexperienced people are shipping software using this tool is insane to me.I really think you&#x27;re trying to compare apples and oranges, in multiple ways. For one, we can test the software by running it, which is a pretty different problem from asking language questions, with a much slower ability to verify correctness (based on what you describe and what I imagine).I&#x27;m not saying your experience is invalid. In my own adventures, the equivalent of what you did was my writing some incomplete bash in an existing script, wandered off to another part of the code. I then came back to that incomplete snippet, and though it was some unfamiliar syntax someone else had written (vim even highlighted it like it was special!). Naturally I went and asked ChatGPT what that snippet did, and wasted 15 minutes trying to corroborate it before checking the git history or something and realizing my own error. reply simias 18 hours agorootparent>For one, we can test the software by running itAs long as the tests are not also written by ChatGPT...Many critical security issues require a deep understanding or the code or some intense fuzzing to discover, it&#x27;s not enough to ask ChatGPT \"write me X\" then superficially glance at the output to validate that it looks correct. That&#x27;s the part that worries me. Completely broken code will be caught immediately, but subtly broken code may linger for a long time and make it to production.And from my limited experience with ChatGPT, it seems very good at making up broken things that look superficially correct. reply renonce 19 hours agorootparentprevJust wondering, are you trying it with GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Better to use GPT-4 API version since the web version’s quality was controversial. When you feel quality is subpar you should try to use the best one first. reply simias 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure but given that I haven&#x27;t paid anything I believe it&#x27;s 3.5. reply imposter 19 hours agorootparentprevMaybe they didn&#x27;t feed it enough linguistical data for japanese, but they surely did for code. reply ed_elliott_asc 19 hours agorootparentThe thing that annoys me is that you can ask it to do something specific but it does what it wants.For example I had a massive sql query that was loads of statements unioned together, I said “for each statement remove this filter and add this filter” and it would go “certainly, here are the first four, I have used an example table name feel free to change it” then I’d say “can you do it for all the statements, not just the first four” and it would say “of course here you go” and just give me the first four but also makes them useless by changing the table name!I’ve got great hopes that one day I can get it to help me shape the code in a way that the jetbrains ide’s can’t today - for those I have to choose from a set of available operations - I want to talk to it and get it to change the code in a set of operations that I choose!One day maybe :) reply simias 18 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the models just answered \"I&#x27;m sorry but I don&#x27;t have an answer to your question at the time\". In fact I think that would be a great answer that would increase the amount of trust I have in ChatGPT.Instead the model decides to make stuff up and pretend that it knows. That&#x27;s vastly worse.It reminds me of the early days of DuckDuckGo, when if you searched for something obscure with no matches online it would still fuzzy match some garbage like a binary blob in a Chinese PDF while Google helpfully would just tell you that it couldn&#x27;t find anything. reply Cannabat 12 hours agorootparent> Instead the model decides to make stuff up and pretend that it knows. That&#x27;s vastly worse.Does the model know it doesn’t know though? Does “know” even make sense as a concept here? I don’t know if it can really introspect like that, but of course it would be so much better if it could can have some sort of confidence score with each answer. reply dleeftink 20 hours agorootparentprevIt would be nice, though, if we could actually observe the training data distributions, alternatively exploring it through the use of the chat interface itself.Right now, without even being allowed that extra digging, it is darn difficult to be sure about its high-dimensional musings. reply kalleboo 20 hours agorootparentYeah this is why for the times when I know I&#x27;m going to want to double-check the sources, I use Bing&#x27;s AI chat bot since that one will do a web search to find pages to summarize and then stick in the source URLs in to check reply dleeftink 20 hours agorootparentNo doubt double checking is good practice, but this still introduces some ranking artefacts, at least in my experience with Phind.What I would like to see most is the actual word&#x2F;phrase&#x2F;source distributions for a given prompt, in order to judge the sparsity of the underlying training data and subsequently, &#x27;crowd source&#x27; the remaining gaps. reply d-lisp 20 hours agoparentprevI kind of enjoy it as a sort of interactive \"learn x in y\" to fast start some hobby project into some programming language I don&#x27;t know yet.

Anytime it’s the talking about something I’m an expert in, I spot tons of errors.I don’t notice nearly as many errors when I’m asking it about things I’m not already an expert in. The most likely explanation is that it’s fooling me.I pay for gpt4. People using chatgpt to “learn” are absolutely slurping up incorrect information without knowing it.Imagine trying to teach yourself physics with textbook where 10% of it is completely but convincingly wrong. reply capableweb 19 hours agorootparent> Imagine trying to teach yourself physics with textbook where 10% of it is completely but convincingly wrong.This is basically how many people already use the internet, read information on random blogposts, stack overflow and more, then take that it&#x27;s true for granted. ChatGPT isn&#x27;t really different than reading those things in the end.What has to change is how people treat information that they read, no matter if it&#x27;s from a blog post, ChatGPT or a friend. Verify everything, before you&#x27;d bet on that it&#x27;s true.I&#x27;ve used GPT4 to understand topics I&#x27;ve had no exposure to before, and it&#x27;s true, a lot of the things GPT4 writes isn&#x27;t accurate in the end, but lots of things are accurate too. That you can mold the information in a different way than static browsing, makes a lot of difference.Overall, even with some false information, ChatGPT personally saves me a ton of times and I find myself only using Google for verifying information now, not for finding information. reply q87b 19 hours agorootparentprevHow is gpt4 different? reply noman-land 20 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s honestly not different from coming across a blog post or a StackOverflow answer, which might be wrong or outdated. You just try it and see what works. If it doesn&#x27;t work, you tinker with it, go to the documentation, etc. You can also tell ChatGPT it doesn&#x27;t work and show it the error and it sometimes has ideas. reply TheRoque 19 hours agorootparentStackOverflow is a bad example, because you see the context, and this is what is definitely missing from ChatGPT. On SO, you see the votes for this answer, you see the date, you see the comments, you see the user who posted it etc. etc. When I check answers on SO, I immediately check at the date, because sometimes it makes the answer invalid, which you can&#x27;t do on ChatGPT since it&#x27;s a complete black box. I prefer other tools like Phind or Bing that attempt to show the sources of what they&#x27;re saying, but it&#x27;s still a lot of things to process. reply noman-land 19 hours agorootparentStackOverflow isn&#x27;t the best example for the reasons you outlined. I was just trying to illustrate the trust but verify mindset. Any time you find an explanation or a solution or anything out in the world, you test it out, read about it, look up terms, etc, to get your head around what&#x27;s being suggested. It&#x27;s not blind copy pasting and it shouldn&#x27;t be. reply matsemann 20 hours agorootparentprevYou can&#x27;t, which is why I&#x27;m not too worried (at the moment at least) for my job. It&#x27;s currently a boost to people already knowledgeable in the area, but people with a lack of understanding of the underlying principles quickly become stuck. reply rambambram 19 hours agorootparentprevSearch on Youtube for videos by Sam Vaknin. He explained this by what is called a &#x27;zimbo&#x27;. An entity that looks like a human, walks like a human, talks like a human, but is essentially devoid of human-ness. The one and only way to determine the difference is trusting your gut, it &#x27;feels&#x27; wrong. Sam Vaknin uses the term &#x27;zimbo&#x27; (derived from zombie, I guess) to explain relationships with cluster B disordered people, but I think it can be used one-on-one on ChatGPT.

I&#x27;ve worked with people whose gut feeling was so wrong and at the same time their overconfidence in it was so high that it was impossible to get anything done. Heuristics only work if they apply to reality, and they have intrinsic limits too. reply rambambram 17 hours agorootparentI never said everybody&#x27;s gut feeling works as it should be. That&#x27;s definitely not the case. I&#x27;m only saying one&#x27;s gut feeling is one&#x27;s only chance at telling the difference between real and fake in the situation described by OP. After you pin pointed your gut feeling, your rational mind can take it into account.

And the cause is the same in both cases: magic.The more magic is involved in getting everything set up, the less well you understand the system you just built, and the harder it will be to do what you need to after the initial scaffolding.

Destroying Filesystems (Datasets) and Snapshots Destroying datasets Destroying snapshots Conclusion ZFS for Dummies# As mentioned on previous posts, I have spent the past few weeks dealing with a ZFS crash on my FreeNAS install. Because of that, not only was I forced to learn how to troubleshoot ZFS, but I also had to learn how to setup new volumes and come up with new backup strategies (between a few other things). This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about ZFS (because I new ‘nada’ to start with). And I’m happy to share some of the knowledge that I gathered with you on this post. Please keep in mind that I don’t consider myself an expert on ZFS (not even close), but I will try to make things simple and easy to understand for someone, who like me, is just getting started with ZFS. About ZFS# What is ZFS and It’s History# ZFS is a local filesystem (i.e.: ext4, NTFS, exfat) and logical volume manager (i.e.: LVM on Linux) created by Sun Microsystems. ZFS was published under an open source license until Oracle bought Sun Microsystems and closed source the license. Because the source code was already in the open and ported to different OSs, eventually a project called ‘OpenZFS’ was created, and that is the core code that is used on most Unix like systems today (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.). ZFS Components# vdev# A vdev is composed of one or more physical drives (can also be of things other than hard drive, like files). They can be combined together in mirrors or RAIDZs. 💡 TIP: There are 7 different types of vdevs, and some of them (like host spare, L2ARC and ZIL) are very important. Pool# A pool is composed of one or more vdevs and they usually contain a volume or a dataset (which you create after creating the pool). You create/define your vdevs when you create a pool (with the zpool command which we’ll see later). This allows you to mix vdev types together to achieve other RAIDZ levels (see example below): Datasets# Dataset is the filesystem part of ZFS (so far we’ve seen the LVM components). Here you can define user access, quotas, compression, snapshots, etc… Volume# Volume is the brother of datasets but in a block device representation. It provides some of the features that datasets have, but not all. Volumes can be useful to run other filesystems on top of ZFS, or to export iSCSI extents. RAIDZ Types# Dynamic/Simple Stripe (RAID0) - Distributes data without parity. Loosing a device means loosing all data MIRROR (RAID1) - Mirrored drives. Used with 2 to 4 disks (or more) RAIDZ-1 (RAID5) - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose one physical drive before a raid failure. RAIDZ requires at least 3 disks RAIDZ-2 (RAID6) - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose up to 2 physical drives. RAIDZ-2 requires at least 4 disks RAIDZ-3 - Distributes parity along with the data and can lose up to 3 physical drives. RAIDZ-3 requires at least 4, but should be used with no less than 5 disks Commands# Let’s take a look at the most common commands for handling ZFS pools and filesystem. We’ll use /dev/sdx to refer to device names, but keep in mind that using the device UUID is preferred in order to avoid boot issues due to device name changes. 1.ZFS Pool Commands# These are the commands related to creating vdevs and pools. We will be looking at: zpool create - Create a pool (and vdevs) zpool status - Displays pool status zpool list - List pool and it’s details zpool history - Shows history of commands for zpool zpool import- Imports and mounts pool zpool export - Exports and unmounts pool zpool destroy - Destroy pool and all filesystems zpool scrub - Starts scrub of pool 1.1.Creating a Pool (and vdevs)# To create a new pool we use the zpool create command. We specify the pool name and the device we want to use. It’s basic usage is: Text Only # zpool create [pool] [devices] Now let’s look at different examples for this command. CREATE A POOL ON A SINGLE DISK# The command below creates a pool on a single disk. Text Only # zpool create tank /dev/sdb CREATE A DYNAMIC STRIPE POOL ON 3 DISKS# Remember that dynamic stripe is the same as RAID0 and that it has no parity. Text Only # zpool create tank /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd We can view the new pool with zpool status Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool status pool: tank state: ONLINE scan: none requested config: NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM tank ONLINE 0 0 0 sdb ONLINE 0 0 0 sdc ONLINE 0 0 0 sdd ONLINE 0 0 0 errors: No known data errors Note that the pool name is ‘tank’ and the vdevs are ‘sdb’, ‘sdc’ and ‘sdd’ CREATE A MIRRORRED POOL ON 2 DISKS# Text Only # zpool create tank mirror sdb sdc Note that I can omit /dev and give the device name. Let’s view the result. Text Only # zpool status pool: tank state: ONLINE scan: none requested config: NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM tank ONLINE 0 0 0 mirror-0 ONLINE 0 0 0 sdb ONLINE 0 0 0 sdc ONLINE 0 0 0 errors: No known data errors Our vdev is ‘mirror-0’ and our pool is tank. CREATE A RAID-Z POOL# Text Only # zpool create tank raidz sdb sdc sdd And the result indicating that my vdev is RAIDZ1. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool status pool: tank state: ONLINE scan: none requested config: NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM tank ONLINE 0 0 0 raidz1-0 ONLINE 0 0 0 sdb ONLINE 0 0 0 sdc ONLINE 0 0 0 sdd ONLINE 0 0 0 errors: No known data errors You can use the same command to create RAIDZ2,3 pools. Text Only # zpool create [pool name] raidz[1,2,3] [devices] SPECIFYING A DEFAULT MOUNT POINT FOR THE POOL# You can also specify the default mount point for the pool by using the -m flag as you create it. Text Only # zpool create tank -m /mnt/tank mirror sdb sdc We can see that our new pool was created and mounted at /mnt/tank Text Only # zfs list NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 99K 4.36G 24K /mnt/tank 💡 TIP: Also read up on the zpool add command. 1.2.Getting Pool Status# After we create a new pool it’s automatically imported into our system. As we have seen before, we can view details of the pool with the zpool status command. Text Only # zpool status tank pool: tank state: ONLINE scan: none requested config: NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM tank ONLINE 0 0 0 mirror-0 ONLINE 0 0 0 sdb ONLINE 0 0 0 sdc ONLINE 0 0 0 errors: No known data errors Some of the fields we did not look before are: state: Indicates if pool is online or not status: Additional information about the pool action: Indicates if there are any pending actions for the pool scan: If a scrub is in progress or the last scrub run status errors: Indicates if there are any problems with the pool For example: Text Only # zpool status tank pool: tank state: ONLINE status: Some supported features are not enabled on the pool. The pool can still be used, but some features are unavailable. action: Enable all features using 'zpool upgrade'. Once this is done, the pool may no longer be accessible by software that does not support the features. See zpool-features(7) for details. scan: scrub repaired 0 in 0 days 03:37:12 with 0 errors on Wed Oct 28 03:37:13 2020 config: NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM tank ONLINE 0 0 0 mirror-0 ONLINE 0 0 0 sdb ONLINE 0 0 0 sdc ONLINE 0 0 0 errors: No known data errors Another example: Text Only # zpool status -v tank pool: tank state: ONLINE status: One or more devices has experienced an error resulting in data corruption.

But there are other commands, like zpool list that can give us information about the pool.

Note that the import command will also mount the pool. LISTS POOLS AVAILABLE TO IMPORT# Running the zpool import command without a pool name will show you a list of pools that can be imported. Example of when no pools are available to be imported. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool import no pools available to import Here we have a pool that can be imported. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool import pool: tank id: 2008489828128587072 state: ONLINE action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier. config: tank ONLINE mirror-0 ONLINE sdb ONLINE sdc ONLINE IMPORTING THE POOL# Give the command a pool name and it will be imported.

The export command attempts to unmount any mounted file systems within the pool before continuing. Text Only # zpool export [pool name] For example: Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool export tank root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool list no pools available If any of the file systems fail to unmount you can forcefully unmount them by using the -f option. However, if ZFS volumes exist and are in use, even with -f it will fail to export. 1.7.Destroying/Deleting Pools# We can use the zfs destroy command to delete pools and all it’s child datasets and/or volumes. ⚠ WARNING: This will delete all your data, including any snapshots your may have. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool destroy tank root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool list no pools available root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool import no pools available to import 1.8.Scrubbing Pools# ZFS scrub checks every block in a pool against its known checksum to make sure that the data is valid. If you have vdevs with parity, ZFS scrub will also repair the data using healthy data from other disks. Scrubs should run on a schedule to make sure your systems stays healthy. INITIATING A SCRUB# Initiating a scrub of a pool is as simple as running: Text Only # zpool scrub [pool] CHECKING THE STATUS OF A SCRUB# You can check the status of a scrub with zpool status and looking for messages in the ‘scan’ section. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:/mnt/tank# zpool status tank pool: tank state: ONLINE scan: scrub repaired 0B in 0 days 00:00:03 with 0 errors on Tue Nov 3 16:26:23 2020 config: NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM tank ONLINE 0 0 0 mirror-0 ONLINE 0 0 0 sdb ONLINE 0 0 0 sdc ONLINE 0 0 0 errors: No known data errors STOPPING A SCRUB# Use the -s flag. Text Only # zpool scrub -s [pool] 2.ZFS Filesystem Commands# Now we will look at the commands that will help us work with filesystems (datasets) and volumes. We will concentrate more on the filesystem side of things and will not cover volumes. The commands we will review are: zfs create - Creates a new volume or filesystem zfs mount/umount - Mounts the filesystem zfs list - Lists datasets and snapshots zfs get/set - Gets configuration and sets configuration for the dataset zfs snapshot - Handles snapshots zfs diff - Used to compare data between snapshot zfs rollback - Rolls back a snapshot zfs send/recv - Sends a snapshot as a stream of data zfs destroy - Deletes datasets and snapshots 2.1. Creating Datasets# We can create datasets with the zfs create command. Here we create ‘dataset1’ as child of the ‘tank’ dataset (that was created automatically with the zpool create command). Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs create tank/dataset1 root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 145K 9.36G 30.6K /tank tank/dataset1 30.6K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset1 CREATING MISSING PARENT DATASETS# We can also create missing parent datasets with the -p flag (similar to mkdir -p). Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs create tank/dataset1/childset1/childset2 cannot create 'tank/dataset1/childset1/childset2': parent does not exist root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs create -p tank/dataset1/childset1/childset2 root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 249K 9.36G 30.6K /tank tank/dataset1 30.6K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset1 tank/dataset1/childset1 61.3K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset1/childset1 tank/dataset1/childset1/childset2 30.6K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset1/childset1/childset2 2.2. Mounting Filesystems (Datasets)# We can use the zfs mount/unmount commands to view the current mount points as well as mounting/unmounting filesystems. VIEWING CURRENT MOUNTED FILESYSTEMS# Without any arguments, zfs mount will display all mounted zfs filesystems and their respective mount points (without the child datasets). Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount tank /tank MOUNTING FILESYSTEMS# Use zfs mount [pool|dataset] to mount filesystems. On the example below we use zfs mount to establish that no datasets are mounted, and then we mount the ‘tank’ dataset and confirm that is mounted with zfs mount. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount tank root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount tank /tank Use the -a option to mount all filesystems. MOUNT A CHILD DATASET# You can also mount a child dataset without the parent datasets. For example, here we confirm that ‘tank’ is not mounted, then we look at the available datasets, and we execute the command to mount the tank/dataset2/childset2 dataset only. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 249K 9.36G 30.6K /tank tank/dataset1 30.6K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset1 tank/dataset2 91.9K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset2 tank/dataset2/childset2 61.3K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset2/childset2 tank/dataset2/childset2/childset2 30.6K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset2/childset2/childset2 root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount tank/dataset2/childset2 root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount tank/dataset2/childset2 /tank/dataset2/childset2 Note that this will create the required path in the OS filesystem to mount the child dataset. If you decide to mount the parent dataset later you may run into a directory is not empty error because of the created directories. UNMOUNTING FILESYSTEMS# Runzfs unmount and specify the dataset name. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount tank /tank root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs unmount tank root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs mount 2.3. Listing Filesystems (Datasets)# You can list the dataset by running zfs list [dataset name]. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list tank NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 253K 9.36G 30.6K /tank And you can also specify the mount point as an argument. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list /tank NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 253K 9.36G 30.6K /tank If run without a dataset name, zfs list will show all datasets in the system recursively. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 253K 9.36G 30.6K /tank tank/dataset1 30.6K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset1 tank/dataset2 91.9K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset2 tank/dataset2/childset2 61.3K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset2/childset2 tank/dataset2/childset2/childset2 30.6K 9.36G 30.6K /tank/dataset2/childset2/childset2 💡 TIP: when specifying a dataset name you can also use the -r flag to display the dataset recursively. 2.4. Getting and Setting Dataset Properties# Properties control the behavior of filesystems, volumes, snapshots, and clones. ZFS properties can look similar to mount options. GETTING A LIST OF ALL THE PROPERTIES FOR A DATASET# Text Only # zfs get all [dataset] GETTING THE CURRENT VALUE FOR A SPECIFIC PROPERTY# Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs get compression tank NAME PROPERTY VALUE SOURCE tank compression off default SETTING A PROPERTY VALUE# Use the zfs set command. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs set compression=lz4 tank root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs get compression tank NAME PROPERTY VALUE SOURCE tank compression lz4 local 2.5. Creating Snapshots# Snapshots allow you to save the state of a filesystem to a current point in time, without duplicating storage (files are not copied). It flags existing data as «read-only» while allowing new data to be added to the filesystem without affecting the existing data blocks that are protected by the snapshot (the whole process is a bit more complicated than this). Let’s take a look at the image below as an example. You have a filesystem with existing data (Data A) and you take a snapshot (snapshot 1). Then you make some changes, add new files (Data B) and take another snapshot (snapthot 2). After that you make even more changes (Data C). Snapshot 1 protects the original data (Data A), while snapshot 2 protects Data Changes (B) as well as the original data (Data A). So you can delete snapshot 1 and data (A) will still be protected. Note: The amount of data used for the snapshots is very small because we are not copying the files, but instead the filesystem top-level metadata block indicating the they belong to a snapshot. And here are a few scenarios of what happens when you delete files and snapshots: Snapshots are great for testing software development, or creating a failsafe before an upgrade. But by no means they should be considered (by itself) as a backup or DR solution. CREATING A SNAPSHOT# Text Only zfs snapshot create [pool/dataset@snapshot_name] For example: Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs snapshot tank/dataset1@snapshot1 root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list -t snapshot NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank/dataset1@snapshot1 17.3K - 3.00G - CREATING RECURSIVE SNAPSHOTS# If you have multiple child datasets, you can either create one snapshot of the top-level dataset (usually the pool name), or use the -r flag to create snapshots recursively. Snapshot of the main dataset: Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs snapshot tank@snapshot-master root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list -t snapshot NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank@snapshot-master 0B - 30.6K - Recursive snapshot: Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs snapshot -r tank@recursive root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list -t snapshot NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank@recursive 0B - 30.6K - tank/dataset1@recursive 0B - 3.00G - LISTING SNAPSHOTS# Use zfs list -t snapshot. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list -t snapshot NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank@recursive 0B - 30.6K - tank/dataset1@recursive 0B - 3.00G - 2.6. Comparing Snapshots# You can use zfs diff to compare snapshots. Text Only # zfs diff [older snapshot] [newer snapshot] For example: Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:# zfs diff tank@initial tank@second +/mnt/tank/file-1.txt +/mnt/tank/file-2.txt +/mnt/tank/file-3.txt M/mnt/tank/ 2.7. Restoring a Snapshot# Restore a snapshots with zfs rollback. Note that restoring a snapshot will delete all files that were created after the snapshot (as we saw in our example). It will also delete any newer snapshots (you will be asked to use the -r option to rollback and delete newer snapshots). Text Only zfs rollback [pool/dataset@snapshot_name] 2.9. Sending and Receiving Snapshots# One of the best features of ZFS is ‘ZFS send’. It allows you send snapshots as a stream of data. This is a great way replicate a snapshot and it’s dataset to a file, another pool or even to another system via SSH. Amazing no! Let’s look at the example below. We have 2 pools in our system named ‘tank’ and ‘backup’. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zpool list NAME SIZE ALLOC FREE CKPOINT EXPANDSZ FRAG CAP DEDUP HEALTH ALTROOT tank 9G 1.50G 7.50G - - 0% 16% 1.00x ONLINE - backup 4.50G 104K 4.50G - - 0% 0% 1.00x ONLINE - In our tank pool we have a dataset for our Movies. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:/tank/Movies# zfs list -r tank NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank 1.50G 7.22G 24K /tank tank/Movies 1.50G 7.22G 1.50G /tank/Movies Before we can send this data we need create a snapshot: Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs snapshot tank/Movies@$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M') root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list -t snapshot NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT tank/Movies@2020-11-03_15-29 0B - 1.50G - And now we can send our snapshot to our backup pool with zfs send/recv. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs send tank/Movies@2020-11-03_15-29zfs recv backup/Movies And let’s confirm that it worked. Text Only root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT backup 1.50G 2.86G 24K /backup backup/Movies 1.50G 2.86G 1.50G /backup/Movies tank 1.50G 7.22G 24K /tank tank/Movies 1.50G 7.22G 1.50G /tank/Movies root@ubuntu-vm:~# zfs list -t snapshot NAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT backup/Movies@2020-11-03_15-29 0B - 1.50G - tank/Movies@2020-11-03_15-29 0B - 1.50G - 💡 TIP: It’s worth to look into all the options and use cases for ZFS send. Combined with RAIDZs and snapshots, it can help you make your filesystem almost indestructible. 2.10. Destroying Filesystems (Datasets) and Snapshots# DESTROYING DATASETS# To destroy a dataset, use zfs destroy (the -r flag also works here). Text Only zfs destroy [pool/dataset] DESTROYING SNAPSHOTS# To destroy a snapshot, also use the zfs destroy command (and the -r flag also works here). Text Only zfs destroy [pool/dataset@snapshot_name] Conclusion# While we covered a lot of different topics and commands on ZFS, in reality, we really only scratched the surface on what ZFS can do.

The learning curve is steeper than I expected. I would love to have a dumbed down wrapper that made the common case dead-simple. For example:- Use sane defaults for pool creation. ashift=12, lz4 compression, xattr=sa, acltype=posixacl, and atime=off. Don&#x27;t even ask me.- Make encryption just on or off instead of offering five or six options- Generate the encryption key for me, set up the systemd service to decrypt the pool at start up, and prompt me to back up the key somewhere- `zfs list` should show if a dataset is mounted or not, if it is encrypted or not, and if the encryption key is loaded or not- No recursive datasets and use {pool}:{dataset} instead of {pool}&#x2F;{dataset} to maintain a clear distinction between pools and datasets.- Don&#x27;t make me name pools or snapshots. Assign pools the name {hostname}-[A-Z]. Name snapshots {pool name}_{datetime created} and give them numerical shortcuts so I never have to type that all out- Don&#x27;t make me type disk IDs when creating pools. Store metadata on the disk so ZFS doesn&#x27;t get confused if I set up a pool with `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda` and `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdb` references and then shuffle around the drives- Always use `pv` to show progress- Automatically set up weekly scrubs- Automatically set up hourly&#x2F;daily&#x2F;weekly&#x2F;monthly snapshots and snapshot pruning- If I send to a disk without a pool, ask for confirmation and then create a new single disk pool for me with the same settings as on the sending pool- collapse `zpool` and `zfs` into a single command- Automatically use `--raw` when sending encrypted datasets, default to `--replicate` when sending, and use `-I` whenever possible when sending- Provide an obvious way to mount and navigate a snapshot dataset instead of hiding the snapshot filesystem in a hidden directory reply rollcat 1 hour agoparentA lot of these suggestions are heavily opinionated. Which is not necessarily bad, but they seem to mess with existing conventions just for the sake of it (why {pool}:{dataset}?).> Don&#x27;t make me name [...] snapshots.You might like this little tool I wrote: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rollcat&#x2F;zfs-autosnapYou put \"zfs-autosnap snap\" in cron hourly (or however often you want a snapshot), and \"zfs-autosnap gc\" in cron daily, and it takes care of maintaining a rolling history of snapshots, per the retention policy.It&#x27;s not hard writing simple ZFS command wrappers, feel free to take my code and make your own tools. reply istjohn 1 hour agorootparentFair point on the {pool}:{dataset} thing. I just don&#x27;t like that the same {pool} name refers to both a pool of vdevs and the top-level dataset on that pool. It makes it that little bit harder to grok the distinction. Perhaps there&#x27;s a better way to emphasize that difference. reply gruturo 1 hour agoparentprevUh you are mixing sensible suggestions (ashift=12 as a default, {pool}:{dataset} syntax, though it will be hard to change so late) with very, very opinionated ones, which break use cases you may not be aware of.Naming pools after hostnames: I have pools on a SAN which can be imported by more than one host.Weekly scrubs, periodic snapshots, periodic pruning: This is really the job of the OS&#x27; scheduler (an equally opinionated view, I admit)collapsing zpool and zfs commands - sure but why? so you can have zfs -pool XXXX and zfs -volume XXXX?No recursive datasets? I have use cases where it&#x27;s very useful.`zfs list` should show if a dataset is mounted or not, if it is encrypted or not, and if the encryption key is loaded or not: Fully agree!Don&#x27;t make me type disk IDs when creating pools: You can address them in 3-4 different ways (by id, by WWN, by label, by sdX etc), and you have to specify in _some_ way which disks you want to go there, so not sure what&#x27;s the point here.Store metadata on the disk so ZFS doesn&#x27;t get confused if I set up a pool with `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda` and `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdb` references and then shuffle around the drives: Already happening. Swap a few drives around and import the pool, it will find them.Some of your suggestions are genuinely OK, at least as defaults, but some indicate you aren&#x27;t really considering much outside your own usage pattern and needs. ZFS caters to a lot more people than you. reply istjohn 10 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not suggesting zfs itself change. I&#x27;d like a porcelain for people with very simple needs where zfs is almost overkill, for people who just want better data integrity and quicker backups on their main machine, for example.I think zpool is unnecessary as an additional command. For example, `zfs scrub`, `zfs destroy [pooldataset]`, `zfs add`, `zfs remove` would all have clear meanings. There may be a couple commands that would need explicit disambiguation with a flag like `zfs create`. reply traceroute66 1 hour agoparentprev> so ZFS doesn&#x27;t get confused if I set up a pool with `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda` and `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdb`To be fair, that&#x27;s not ZFS&#x27;s problem, that is your problem for not keeping up with the times. PBCAK.For quite some time now, Linux has had fully-qualified references, e.g. : `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;disk&#x2F;by-id&#x2F;ata-$manufactuer-$serial-$whatever`That is what you should be using when building your pools. reply istjohn 1 minute agorootparentMy problem is that that&#x27;s a pain to type out. I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s necessary (and other&#x27;s have said it&#x27;s not), but it&#x27;d be more convenient to just do `mirror &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdb` than `mirror &#x2F;dev&#x2F;disk&#x2F;by-id&#x2F;ata-WDC_WDBNCE5000PNC_21365M802768 &#x2F;dev&#x2F;disk&#x2F;by-id&#x2F;ata-Samsung_SSD_850_EVO_500GB_S2RANX0HA52854X` reply barrkel 1 hour agoparentprevIt&#x27;s interesting; I&#x27;m the kind of person who feels uncomfortable using something without understanding the shape of the stack underneath it. A magic black box is anathema; I want to know how to use the thing with mechanical sympathy, aligning my work with the grain of the implementation details. I want to understand error messages when they happen. I want to know how to diagnose something when it breaks, especially when it&#x27;s something as important as my data.I like how ZFS is put together. I&#x27;ve been running it for about 13 years. I started with Nexenta, a Solaris fork with Debian userland. I&#x27;ve ported my pool twice, had a bunch of HDD failures, and haven&#x27;t lost a single byte.I agree with you on most of the encryption stuff. That is very recent and not fully integrated and the user experience isn&#x27;t fully baked. I don&#x27;t agree on unifying zpool and zfs; for a good long time, I served zvols from my zpool, and dividing up storage management and its redundancy configuration from file system management makes sense to me. Similarly, recursive datasets make sense; you want inheritance or something very like it when managing more than a handful of filesystems. I don&#x27;t agree on pool names (why anyone would want ordinal pool naming and just replicate the problem you just stated re sda, sdb etc. is a bit mysterious), and I don&#x27;t agree on snapshots (to me this is like preferring commit IDs in git to branch and tag names - manually created snapshots outside periodic pruning should be named).ZoL on Ubuntu does periodic scrubs by default now. Sometimes I have to stop them because they noticeably impact I&#x2F;O too much. Periodic snapshots is one of the first cronjobs I created on Nexenta, and while there&#x27;s plenty of tooling, it also needs configuration - if you are not aware of it, it&#x27;s an easy way to retain references to huge volumes of data, depending on use case. Not all of my ZFS filesystems are periodically snapshotted the same way. reply istjohn 32 minutes agorootparentI see the utility in recursive datasets and I wouldn&#x27;t want them to go away, but if I were creating a zfs-for-dummies I wouldn&#x27;t include the functionality. You&#x27;d have to drop down to the raw zpool&#x2F;zfs commands to get that.Likewise, I appreciate being able to name snapshots, but it&#x27;s annoying to have to manually name the snapshot I create in order to zfs send. The solution there is probably to not make me take a manual snapshot in the first place. `zfs send` should automatically make the snapshot for me. But in general, I don&#x27;t see why zfs can&#x27;t default to a generic name and let me override it with a `--name` flag.Giving it more thought, I think I would keep pool naming. What I don&#x27;t like is the possibility of having pool name collisions which isn&#x27;t something you have to think about with, say, ext4 filesystems. But the upshot, as you point out, is with zfs you aren&#x27;t stuck using sda, sdb, etc. reply gigatexal 1 hour agoparentprevI’m on the other end of the spectrum. I like knowing the flags and settings I use to create the pools.For snapshots and replication take a look at sanoid (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimsalterjrs&#x2F;sanoid). reply aborsy 1 hour agoparentprev— when destroying a dataset, please ask for confirmation before permanently deleting it— please provide support for multiple key slots as in LUKS— please build in the functionality of sanoid and syncoid, so that snapshots and replication don’t need a third party tool— please build a usable deduplication, so that we don’t have to use external tools such as Restic or Borg reply Modified3019 34 minutes agorootparentI’m not sure what restic or borg are or do for you, but there is an upcoming feature called “block cloning” that is a sort of on-demand version deduplication that offers new advantages for certain setups.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bsdcan.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;bsdcan_2023&#x2F;sessions&#x2F;session&#x2F;1... reply istjohn 1 hour agorootparentprevDo you use Restic or Borg with ZFS? How do you have that set up? Do you use them in lieu of zfs send&#x2F;recv? reply paulmd 2 hours agoparentprevthis is honestly hard because many of the decisions that matter are not things you type into zfs at all (except incidentally).how many disks per vdev? how much memory? etca lot of the things you&#x27;ve outlined are not universal at all, just situational reply istjohn 2 hours agorootparentYes, there is a lot of essential complexity that is unavoidable, but there are a lot of people like me who just want a better desktop file system, and we don&#x27;t need to know about SLOGs and L2ARCs and the half dozen compression algorithms, etc. It&#x27;s situational, but it&#x27;s a common enough situation that a targeted solution would be valuable. reply mastax 1 hour agorootparent`compression=on` exists.You don&#x27;t need to know about SLOGs and L2ARCs. They&#x27;re not super useful generally but people geek out a out them.I know those were just examples and I don&#x27;t disagree with the general point. reply MrDresden 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;m one of those who wants a better desktop file system but have stayed away from ZFS (at least for the time being) due to stories about complexity.Would you say that the defaults are sane enough for that kind of person (no real configuration needed)? reply Modified3019 8 minutes agorootparentOutside of it being a good idea to manually set `ashift=12` on each vdev creation (because disks lie and zfs’s whitelist isn’t omniscient. I’ve seen too many people burned by this) and `atime=off` for datasets (because burning IO updating the metadata because you’ve accessed something is just fucking stupid), the defaults are sane and you can basically refuse to care about them after that.Every system I’ve used has `compression=on` set as default, which currently means lz4. People set it manually out of paranoia from earlier days I think.For linux systems you can set `xattr=sa` and `acltype=posixacl` if you like, which offers a minor optimization that you’ll never notice.I suppose if you don’t like how much memory zfs uses for ARC, you can reduce it. For desktop use 2-4gb is plenty. For actual active heavier storage use like working with big files or via a slow HDD filled NAS, 8GB+ is a better amount.Dataset recordsize can be set as well, but that’s really something for nerds like me that have huge static archives (set to 1-4MiB) or virtual machines (match with qcow2’s 64KiB cluster size). The default recordsize works well enough for everything that unless you have a particular concern, you don’t need to care.I should note, beware of rolling release linux distros and ZFS. The linux kernel breaks compatibility nonstop, and sometimes it can take a while for zfs to catch up. This means your distro can update, and suddenly you can’t load your filesystem. ZFSbootmenu is probably the best way to navigate that, it makes rolling back easy.You also want to setup automatic snapshots, snapshot pruning, and sending of snapshots to a backup machine.

There were no actual problems, but I could never get over the fact that it&#x27;s so complicated underneath I have to relearn everything every time I do any sort of advanced maintenance.For example, I had to move between SSDs which is an absolutely trivial operation with any other filesystem if you know your Linux well. It took me maybe three hours of work on ZFS because it brings its own environment and does everything its own way, so I had to remember and re-discover a lot of stuff. The system booted on maybe 15th try.If you are fine with this, or you&#x27;re not going to use it on root, or you are a FreeBSD user, it&#x27;s an excellent choice for pretty much any task. reply istjohn 1 hour agorootparentprevNo, not really. There&#x27;s a lot of unavoidable complexity like needing to understand what ZFS pools, vdevs, and datasets are and how they relate to each other. And then if you want to encrypt your data that adds another bit of functionality you need to configure. And then there are just a lot of things that aren&#x27;t that important for most people, but you won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s important for you until you understand what they are.I would say the learning curve is similar but perhaps a bit steeper than configuring vim for web development for the first time or configuring nginx and let&#x27;s encrypt on a webserver for the first time.It didn&#x27;t help that I started by trying to setup root on encrypted zfs. I would recommend first using zfs unencrypted, then adding encryption once you&#x27;re comfortable with that, and finally trying &#x2F;home on zfs or even root on zfs. reply 0mp 48 minutes agorootparentprevThe defaults are absolutely sane.

They give reasons for everything and cite multiple sources, which is gold. If you search around the web elsewhere you will find endless contradicting advice, anecdotes and myths that are accompanied with incomplete and baseless theories. Ultimately you should also test this stuff and understand everything you tune (it&#x27;s ok to decide to not tune something).For replication, I can only recommend the man pages... yeah, really! ZFS gives you solid replication tools, but they are too agnostic, they are like git pluming, they don&#x27;t assume you&#x27;re going to be doing it over SSH (even though that&#x27;s almost always how it&#x27;s being used)... so you have to plug it together yourself, and this feels scary at first, especially because you probably want it to be automated, which means considering edge cases... which is why everyone runs to something like syncoid, but there&#x27;s something horrible I discovered with replication scripts like syncoid, which is that they don&#x27;t use ZFS&#x27;s send --replication mode! They try to reimplement it in perl, for \"greater flexibility\", but incompletely. This is maddening when you are trying to test this stuff for the first time and find that all of the encryption roots break when you do a fresh restore, and not all dataset properties are automatically synced. ZFS takes care of all of this if you simply use the build in recursive \"replicate\" option. It&#x27;s not that hard to script manually once you commit to it, just keep it simple, don&#x27;t add a bunch of unnecessary crap into the pipeline like syncoid does, (they actually slow it down if you test), just use pv to monitor progress and it will fly.I might publish my replication scripts at some point because I feel like there are no good functional reference scripts for this stuff that deal with the basics without going nuts and reinventing replication badly like so many others.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;letsencrypt&#x2F;openzfs-nvme-databases reply yjftsjthsd-h 4 hours agoparent> For databases (you really should at minimum do basic tuning like block size alignment),One unexpected thing to check (and do check, because your mileage will vary) - the suggestion is usually to align record sizes, which in practice tends to mean reducing the record size on the ZFS filesystem holding the data. I don&#x27;t doubt that this is at some level more efficient, but I can empirically tell you that it kills compression ratios. Now the funny knock-on effect is that it can - and again, I say can because it will vary by your workload - but it can actually result in worse throughput if you&#x27;re bottlenecked on disk bandwidth, because compression lets you read&#x2F;write data faster than the disk is physically capable of, so killing that compression can do bad things to your read&#x2F;write bandwidth. reply tomxor 4 hours agorootparentI know what you&#x27;re getting at, I wondered the same thing, but my results were the opposite of what I expected for compression.I enabled lz4 compression and set recordsize for database datasets to 16k to match innoDB... turns out even at 16k my databases are extremely compressible 3-4x AFAIR (I didn&#x27;t write the DB schema for the really big DBs, they are not great, and I suspect that there is a lot of redundant data even within 16k of contiguous data)... maybe I could get even more throughput with larger record sizes, but seems unlikely.As you say, mileage will vary, it&#x27;s subjective, but then I wasn&#x27;t using compression before ZFS, so I don&#x27;t have a comparison. I have only done basic performance testing, overall it&#x27;s an improvement over ext4, but I&#x27;ve not been trying to fine tune it, I&#x27;m just happy to not have made it worse so far while gaining ZFS. reply yjftsjthsd-h 3 hours agorootparentOh, nice. In my case I sort of forgot to set the record sizes, got great compression, and then realized I&#x27;d missed the record sizes so tried lowering&#x2F;matching them and watched compression ratio drop to... I think all the way to 1.0:( So that was a natural experiment, as it were. But of course it totally depends on the exact size and most of all your data. reply tomxor 3 hours agorootparentI suppose ultimately the thing to test is application performance, (assuming you don&#x27;t care too much about disk space). Because it depends on the access pattern. If reading and writing contiguously, then large record sizes (even if unaligned) with high compression ratio might be fastest. but if it&#x27;s more weighted to highly randomised, then the larger ZFS record sizes might actually cause read and write amplification and a lower throughput even if the overall on-disk size is smaller (assuming it doesn&#x27;t all fit in memory in which case this is all moot).Another new thing that&#x27;s possible with innoDB these days is that you can actually change the default 16k page size, i.e you could align innoDB to your preferred ZFS recordsize if that makes sense for your application. replyguerby 4 hours agoprevI started to use ZFS (on Linux) a few years ago and it went smoothly.My only surprise was volblocksize default which is pretty bad for most RAIDZ configuration: you need to increase it to avoid loosing 50% of raw disk space...Articles touching this topic :https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jro.io&#x2F;nas&#x2F;#overheadhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;openzfs.github.io&#x2F;openzfs-docs&#x2F;Basic%20Concepts&#x2F;RAID...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delphix.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zfs-raidz-stripe-width-or-how-i...And you end up on one of the ZFS \"spreadsheet\" out there:ZFS overhead calc.xlsx https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1tf4qx1aMJp8Lo_R6gpT6...RAID-Z parity cost https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1pdu_X2tR4ztF6_HLtJ-D... reply mastax 1 hour agoprevI&#x27;ve run into a ZFS problem I don&#x27;t understand.

I asked a few questions on the community forum but the vast majority of answers were \"Have you read the documentation?!\" \"Do you have enough RAM?!\".The documentation in question was a PowerPoint presentation with difficult to read styling, somewhat evangelical language, lots of assumptions about knowledge and it was not regularly updated.

Worst case is fork.I very much regret the fragmentation of FS design, it has many mothers. \"there can only be one\" was never going to work, but we seem to have perhaps 4-5 more than we really need. ZFS manages to wrap up a number of behaviours cohesively with good version-dependent signalling so it should always be possible to know you&#x27;re risking a non-reversible change to your flags.

People on HN and proggit kinda suck at legal reply arjvik 4 hours agorootparentprevPlaying devil&#x27;s advocate here, but what if Oracle decides to sue you, a company with only a few thousands in revenue, for their multi-million dollar licensing fee?I agree this is unlikely, but so is someone being born with as much litigiousness as Larry Ellison. reply TheDong 4 hours agorootparentThis is built on a misunderstanding of what the ZFS licensing issue is.ZFS is licensed under the CDDL [0], which is a copyleft license that grants you full rights to use the ZFS source code for basically anything, providing that any derivative works incorporating its source code are also are under the CDDL. There is no \"licensing fee\" that you can pay Oracle related to this.Linux is licensed under the GPL, which just like the CDDL, is a copyleft license which requires derivative works to be distributed under the GPL.The conflict here is that both require the entire derived work to be distributed under CDDL&#x2F;GPL, but obviously only one license can be picked.... even though realistically, GPL and CDDL are quite similar licenses.The additional fact that is useful to know is that zfs.ko, the zfs kernel module, is distributed under the CDDL by ubuntu, and any other distro distributing it that I know of.So, with that knowledge, who can sue who and why?1. The people that can be sued are people distributing compiled zfs binaries (the &#x27;zfs.ko&#x27; kernel binary). In practice, this means canonical, and anyone else who distributes disk images using ZFS (such as snapshotted EC2 AMIs)2. The people who can sue are the holders of the Linux GPL license, and they can do so by claiming zfs.ko violates their copyright by being a derived work of the linux kernel, but being distributed under the CDDL rather than the GPL.So, first of all, the vast majority of companies using ZFS aren&#x27;t also distributing binary distributions containing zfs.ko and the linux kernel together, therefore this whole thing is moot. Realistically, most companies using ZFS only have the risk of _canonical_ being sued, and that breaking their filesystem, not them running into legal issues themselves.And second, it would require a holder of Linux copyright to file suit, and realistically, no court could find significant damages here.Canonical also has lawyers that claim 2 wouldn&#x27;t legally follow, that &#x27;zfs.ko&#x27; is not in fact a derived work of the linux kernel. There&#x27;s differing opinions there, but pretty much everyone agrees that the people who could sue if this interpretation is wrong is the holders of Linux copyright, not oracle.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Common_Development_and_Distrib... reply jclulow 1 hour agorootparentNote that unlike the GPL, the CDDL is file-based. It doesn&#x27;t require your entire body of software to be CDDL, it just requires that you make modifications to CDDL-licenced files available under the CDDL. reply arjvik 3 hours agorootparentprevI see, thanks for educating me on this with such an in-depth reply! I simply saw \"licensing issue\" and \"Oracle\" together and assumed the standard Oracle licensing worry applied. reply kaba0 4 hours agorootparentprevOn what grounds? ZFS has an open-source license. The only semi-open question related to the topic is packaging it together with another, different open-source license that is viral and mandates more things (GPL). That part is not being “violated” by an enduser, but the distro maintainer. reply rodgerd 4 hours agoparentprev [–] Do you refuse to use NVidia cards for the same reason? reply yjftsjthsd-h 4 hours agorootparentHonestly the nvidia thing was always annoying because it seems like the linux devs are more aggressive about licensing with an actual full-on Open Source project than the very much closed-source nvidia drivers. They even both use the same approach of having a GPL wrapper to talk to the non-GPL code AFAIK:\\ reply mrweasel 2 hours agorootparentprevThat might be a bad example. I&#x27;d trust ZFS and the CDDL before NVIDIA any day. At least the CDDL is designed with the intention of being open attemps to work with other licenses. NVIDIA seems hellbent on working around the GPL. reply teddyh 1 hour agorootparentThe original intention of the license doesn’t really matter when its current copyright holder is Oracle. reply dontupvoteme 4 hours agorootparentprev [–] No choice on that front. reply NavinF 2 hours agorootparent [–] New drivers are MIT&#x2F;GPL2 dual-licensed: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;open-gpu-kernel-modules reply mrweasel 2 hours agorootparent [–] Doesn&#x27;t that still require the closed source user space driver to function? I&#x27;d love to be wrong on that one. reply vetinari 1 hour agorootparent [–] In the short-term yes, in the long term the user space driver would also get open (or replaced with nouveau, since it will be on equal footing with the closed one, when communicating with kernel; just like the open vs closed amd drivers).However, what will be left is a blob, that runs on the dedicated core on the GPU. The stuff that Nvidia doesn&#x27;t want to open is moved there, and that&#x27;s why the open kernel driver works only on Turing and newer. reply mrweasel 1 hour agorootparent [–] > However, what will be left is a blob, that runs on the dedicated core on the GPUBut that basically firmware, right? So not all that different from the firmware loaded by a NIC? reply vetinari 1 hour agorootparent [–] Yes, exactly the same thing. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Here he is guessing locations based on just grass:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iOCR73U8t6EThe scary part of this being possible is that I would think AI could do what he is doing even better than him, and at that point there will be a service where you can upload any photo and get it&#x27;s location. This seems like it will be abused, and I dont see what can be done about it. reply steve_adams_86 7 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s an episode in which he competes with an AI, but it turns out to be narrowing down locations using data most (if not all) humans couldn&#x27;t. Imagine for example that the camera in a certain locale had some debris on it, but it&#x27;s a unique shape and location on the lens. Or perhaps there&#x27;s rain on the lens in various patterns. The AI neatly organizes these locations by their coordinates, then if it sees any other images with similar terrain and the same lens anomalies, it will guess with extremely high accuracy.It left me wondering how effective it would be with current technology if it couldn&#x27;t \"cheat\" in this way. I put cheat in quotations because in any situation where any metadata like this would be useful for location identification, it wouldn&#x27;t matter how it worked. But, strictly using geological data, how would it perform? reply jsmith99 3 hours agorootparentRainbolt also uses these tricks wherever possible. Eg pro geoguesser players know how high the camera angle is on street view in each country, and which countries the edge of the Google car is visible on shot. reply steve_adams_86 1 hour agorootparentDefinitely, that’s worth mentioning and I was arguably wrong to say most or all humans couldn’t do it. Many of the things the AI did really are things humans do. I think what I meant to say is that the depth and breadth in which the AI can do it is superhuman. Like, tiny bits of dust on the lens a person couldn’t really see become clearly and reliably identifiable features of locales. We can use aspect, seams, and other more obvious features of camera images in specific areas, but the AI can go quite a lot further using minute and sometimes almost imperceptible details. reply zimpenfish 6 hours agorootparentprev> Imagine for example that the camera in a certain locale had some debris on it, but it&#x27;s a unique shape and location on the lens.I believe Facebook patented a method for using lens imperfections (dust, scratches, etc.) - see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18835377 reply cma 4 hours agorootparentThe patent office is going to change it so if a generic neural network put to a task learns the same technique as a human patent, the patent fails the ordinarily skilled in the art test. reply charcircuit 6 hours agorootparentprevHuman geoguessr players use cheats like like less defects or other accidents with the captures. reply steve_adams_86 1 hour agorootparentYou’re right, I totally neglected to point that out. I more so meant the AI is far better and doing this than humans are, and it’s wrong to say most&#x2F;all humans can’t do it.

They tried geolocating based on stars, but what ended up giving away the solution was a tweet from a local diner waitress posting a pic with Shia. Once they narrowed it down to a small town, then it got a bit fun, with one anon driving around and honking, so they could determine the location of the flag based on the volume of the honking sound on the livestream. And the whole drone usage to \"alter\" the flag was pretty unexpected.But one of the latter ones was kinda crazy.
