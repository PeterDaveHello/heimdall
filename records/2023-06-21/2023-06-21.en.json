This is created by the authors of Loft.sh and Devspaces, both really great solutions to the most common problems of developing natively in a K8s cluster.DevPod is basically Vagrant but with containers, which brings a ton of benefits over the former VM-centric design. You can maintain an entire team (or organization) with one immutable development environment, to get away from the constant toil of fixing random problems on random people's dev environments that happened because they changed something locally and don't have an immutable environment to restore.The fact that it's self-hosted means you can take it anywhere (your laptop, GCloud, AWS, Azure, etc). Containers means you can save resources or scale it, reuse public containers and container ecosystem tools. Unopinionated means you aren't forced to use one IDE or platform. Open Source means you can read the source to figure out what's going on and hack in a solution if needed.This one is still early days it seems, as it doesn't run on my Mac (I opened an issue). But the benefits once it works will be incredible. I've been trying to onboard our teams to Devspace, which has its warts [and lack of docs], but is still lightyears better than most other solutions. Once DevPod is stable I'll be looking into moving to it.replygentele 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Thanks for opening an issue! We'll definitely look into that.

I tried the service quite a long time ago because I used to find the \"cloud coding\" concept enticing, though it was definitely not as baked (probably due to Monaco not existing at the time, and likewise, browsers not being as good.) Nowadays I still feel like the user experience problems, limitations, and cost (when not subsidized) with coding this way largely make it a niche for people who have unusual needs. Especially because, there are tons of local options for reproducible dev environments, and they can continue to work without a network connection or on unreliable connections, something that is unimpressive even in the best conditions I've seen so far.If you happen to have the exact set of needs that one of these products solve, then it can probably work fairly well. But, even when working on \"web\" stuff, I always find myself feeling like they're just never quite as good as just doing things locally. I feel like devcontainers and cloud coding in general are more impressive to those who haven't managed to tame their own dev environments and are seeing a solution to this for the first time.It's also clearly useful for people on iPads and other devices that are either too low end to run/compile your code or arbitrarily limited to prevent it. However, with how powerful iPads are nowadays, it feels like if Apple ever allowed apps to use virtualization extensions, it would probably be a better solution for a lot of people who do not need a huge cloud workstation with a lot of RAM. I imagine your average Rails app or Go backend would just have no problem running directly on an iPad.replynvartolomei 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]https://hocus.dev/replyluckywatcher 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's not a direct competitor, but we use https://tilt.dev/ at my company for local and remote development.replynkko 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]https://www.daytona.io is currently in stealth preparing to launch.

Constantly having to rebuild containers to recompile dependencies; dealing with permissions differences for volume mounts; having to modify all the scripts to start with \"docker compose run --rm\"; having to deal with no shell history or dot files in the application containers... it leaves a lot to be desired.replyKronisLV 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Constantly having to rebuild containers to recompile dependencies;How often is this actually necessary? I've had projects that stick with the same dependencies for weeks/months and don't need anything new added outside of periodic version updates. There, most of the changes were the actual code, that was needed for shipping business functionality.Furthermore, with layer caching, re-building isn't always a very big issue, though I'll admit that the slowness can definitely be problematic! Except for the fact that you don't have to pollute your local workstation with random packages/runtimes (that might conflict with packages for other projects, depending on the technologies you use and what is installed on a per project basis or globally), and the fact that you get mostly reproducible environments quite easily - both of those are great, at least when it works!> ...dealing with permissions differences for volume mounts;This is definitely a big mess, even worse if you need to run Windows on your workstation for whatever reason, as opposed to a Linux distro (though I guess WSL can help). I personally ran into bunches of issues when mounting files, that more or less shattered the illusion of containers solving the dev environment problem sufficiently: https://blog.kronis.dev/everything%20is%20broken/containers-...But for what it's worth, at least they're trying and are okay for the most part otherwise.replyinglor 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> How often is this actually necessary?Think \"I have several teams and the output of 'team a' is a dependency of 'team b'\" and 'team a' needs to release twice a day\".replyKronisLV 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> ...and 'team a' needs to release twice a day\"That's quite the fast paced environment!

I expected a docker container having all the deps except for running the project which would be something that\u2019s mounted as a volume.

And have a bash open to run additional commands.Maybe my assumptions are wrong though\u2026?replyCGamesPlay 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The first problem you'll encounter here is if you're using a language that keeps dependencies in a separate place (virtualenv, central cache location, etc.). You have to figure out how that works and mount that location as a separate volume, or else you'll be constantly recompiling everything when your container is recreated. Using a bind mount for the project files is also annoying because docker-compose makes no effort to sync your uid/gid, so you have all sorts of annoying permissions issues between local/container. And installing packages into your container that doesn't have an init process is... annoying at best. You can use sysbox to get one, but you're not really \"just using docker compose\" at that point.replyPrivateButts 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]That's the dream, but in my experience there are some thorns, and some things that just suck. Mostly these come from Windows, like a dev station using the wrong line endings, filesystem watchers not working if the project isn't on WSL storage, file permissions getting mucked up, etc. However, what is a pain in the butt is adding dependencies. Do you attach a shell and run npm in the container or try to do it on the host system. Do it in the container, and you'll have to make sure those changes make it's way back out, and that you rebuild the container the next time you launch it. Do it on the host, and you could run into cross platform issues if a package isn't supported on Windows, and you'll have to rebuild the container.However, once you're aware of this, honestly it's not that big of a deal. Docker rebuilds are pretty fast nowadays, and you can use tools like just to make the DX a little easier by adding macros to run stuff in a container.End of the day though, folks are all gonna have their own way of working, and I think dev containers could have an advantage for peeps doing remote development. It would be nice to have a system where our developers could dial in to a container with everything they need from anywhere they want to work.replyGTP 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]But this is still based on Docker, right?

We support VS Code (local and browser), pretty much the entire Jetbrains suite, and you can even connect via VIM :Dreplydonmcronald 13 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I looked at this about a week ago and think it has potential. One thing I dislike, and it's an industry wide problem, is the eagerness to continuously (re)build containers on demand [1].Everyone does it, but I think that's a mistake. What I want is something where I can build and publish a dev container to my local Docker registry and then use that container to develop until I decide I need to build an updated version due to changes in the OS, dependencies, etc..To help clarify, look at this picture [2]. I'd want everything up to dependencies or resources, plus all of the tooling needed to make the Jetbrains Gateway, etc. work in the dev container. I want to build that container on a calendar based schedule (ex: daily) and have everything I need to develop accessible via local repositories that I can use without connecting to the internet.Long ago I came to the conclusion that most Docker builds aren't repeatable, so the idea of re-building a consistent environment seems naive. For example:  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install vimWithout specifying the exact version of every dependency, you won't be guaranteed the same version of 'vim' every time. Plus, even if you specify the exact version of your direct dependencies, I think you can still end up with varying transitive dependency versions. Even just the 'apt-get update' portion of that command is often misunderstood since it can return 0 as a result of transient failure.So, even if your intent is to build a container with the most up-to-date versions of everything, a transient failure between the update and install commands can leave you with ancient versions of dependencies, even if you intended everything to be up-to-date. This is especially true if you're using a local APT cache like Sonatype Nexus where the upstream 'update' might fail and the local cache probably has old versions of all the dependencies, allowing the install command to succeed.IMO it's better just to assume you have zero guarantees when (re)building Docker images and you're better off adopting a strategy of build, publish, use.1. https://devpod.sh/docs/developing-in-workspaces/devcontainer...2. https://phauer.com/2019/no-fat-jar-in-docker-image/#the-solu...replydonmcronald 10 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Reading the docs more, it looks like the prebuilt workspaces [1] are closer to what I would want.1. https://devpod.sh/docs/developing-in-workspaces/prebuild-a-w...replyj1elo 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Even just the 'apt-get update' portion of that command is often misunderstood since it can return 0 as a result of transient failure.Tiny correction that got me confused: an exit code of '0' would actually mean 'success', so you probably just meant that it could fail at any moment.But also, this can happen any time external servers are accessed, regardless of the tool. An npm install could fail any time without warning, if the servers are down. Devs should expect their supply chain to break sooner or later, and plan accordingly depending on the severity of the consequences.My example is if you use the Ubuntu debug packages repository, you'll basically never know if the next run will work until 'apt-get update' is run. Those repos are seemingly down or 'reindexing' for hours every few days.replydonmcronald 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Tiny correction that got me confused: an exit code of '0' would actually mean 'success', so you probably just meant that it could fail at any moment.No. It fails and then returns 0 = success.

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36400465",
    "content": "aaron maxwellresumesoftwarewritingwebHow \"Exit Traps\" Can Make Your Bash Scripts Way More Robust And ReliableThere is a simple, useful idiom to make your bash scripts more robust - ensuring they always perform necessary cleanup operations, even when something unexpected goes wrong. The secret sauce is a pseudo-signal provided by bash, called EXIT, that you can trap; commands or functions trapped on it will execute when the script exits for any reason. Let's see how this works.The basic code structure is like this:#!/bin/bashfunction finish { # Your cleanup code here}trap finish EXITYou place any code that you want to be certain to run in this \"finish\" function. A good common example: creating a temporary scratch directory, then deleting it after.#!/bin/bashscratch=$(mktemp -d -t tmp.XXXXXXXXXX)function finish { rm -rf \"$scratch\"}trap finish EXITYou can then download, generate, slice and dice intermediate or temporary files to the $scratch directory to your heart's content. [1]# Download every linux kernel ever.... FOR SCIENCE!for major in {1..4}; do for minor in {0..99}; do  for patchlevel in {0..99}; do   tarball=\"linux-${major}-${minor}-${patchlevel}.tar.bz2\"   curl -q \"http://kernel.org/path/to/$tarball\" -o \"$scratch/$tarball\" || true   if [ -f \"$scratch/$tarball\" ]; then    tar jxf \"$scratch/$tarball\"   fi  done donedone# magically merge them into some frankenstein kernel ...# That done, copy it to a destinationcp \"$scratch/frankenstein-linux.tar.bz2\" \"$1\"# Here at script end, the scratch directory is erased automaticallyCompare this to how you'd remove the scratch directory without the trap:#!/bin/bash# DON'T DO THIS!scratch=$(mktemp -d -t tmp.XXXXXXXXXX)# Insert dozens or hundreds of lines of code here...# All done, now remove the directory before we exitrm -rf \"$scratch\"What's wrong with this? Plenty:If some error causes the script to exit prematurely, the scratch directory and its contents don't get deleted. This is a resource leak, and may have security implications too.If the script is designed to exit before the end, you must manually copy 'n paste the rm command at each exit point.There are maintainability problems as well. If you later add a new in-script exit, it's easy to forget to include the removal - potentially creating mysterious heisenleaks.Keeping Services Up, No Matter WhatAnother scenario: Imagine you are automating some system administration task, requiring you to temporarily stop a server... and you want to be dead certain it starts again at the end, even if there is some runtime error. Then the pattern is:function finish {  # re-start service  sudo /etc/init.d/something start}trap finish EXITsudo /etc/init.d/something stop# Do the work...# Allow the script to end and the trapped finish function to start the# daemon back up.A concrete example: suppose you have MongoDB running on an Ubuntu server, and want a cronned script to temporarily stop the process for some regular maintenance task. The way to handle it is:function finish {  # re-start service  sudo service mongdb start}trap finish EXIT# Stop the mongod instancesudo service mongdb stop# (If mongod is configured to fork, e.g. as part of a replica set, you# may instead need to do \"sudo killall --wait /usr/bin/mongod\".)Capping Expensive ResourcesThere is another situation where the exit trap is very useful: if your script initiates an expensive resource, needed only while the script is executing, and you want to make certain it releases that resource once it's done. For example, suppose you are working with Amazon Web Services (AWS), and want a script that creates a new image.(If you're not familar with this: Servers running on the Amazon cloud are called \"instances\". Instances are launched from Amazon Machine Images, a.k.a. \"AMIs\" or \"images\". AMIs are kind of like a snapshot of a server at a specific moment in time.)A common pattern for creating custom AMIs looks like:Run an instance (i.e. start a server) from some base AMI.Make some modifications to it, perhaps by copying a script over and then executing it.Create a new image from this now-modified instance.Terminate the running instance, which you no longer need.That last step is really important. If your script fails to terminate the instance, it will keep running and accruing charges to your account. (In the worst case, you won't notice until the end of the month, when your bill is way higher than you expect. Believe me, that's no fun!)If our AMI-creation is encapsulated in a script, we can set an exit trap to destroy the instance. Let's rely on the EC2 command line tools:#!/bin/bash# define the base AMI ID somehowami=$1# Store the temporary instance ID hereinstance=''# While we are at it, let me show you another use for a scratch directory.scratch=$(mktemp -d -t tmp.XXXXXXXXXX)function finish {  if [ -n \"$instance\" ]; then    ec2-terminate-instances \"$instance\"  fi  rm -rf \"$scratch\"}trap finish EXIT# This line runs the instance, and stores the program output (which# shows the instance ID) in a file in the scratch directory.ec2-run-instances \"$ami\" > \"$scratch/run-instance\"# Now extract the instance ID.instance=$(grep '^INSTANCE' \"$scratch/run-instance\" | cut -f 2)At this point in the script, the instance (EC2 server) is running [2]. You can do whatever you like: install software on the instance, modify its configuration programatically, et cetera, finally creating an image from the final version. The instance will be terminated for you when the script exits - even if some uncaught error causes it to exit early. (Just make sure to block until the image creation process finishes.)Plenty Of UsesI believe what I've covered in this article only scratches the surface; having used this bash pattern for years, I still find new interesting and fun ways to apply it. You will probably discover your own situations where it will help make your bash scripts more reliable.FootnotesThe -t option to mktemp is optional on Linux, but needed on OS X. Make your scripts using this idiom more portable by including this option.When getting the instance ID, instead of using the scratch file, we could just say: instance=$(ec2-run-instances \"$ami\" | grep '^INSTANCE' | cut -f 2). But using the scratch file makes the code a bit more readable, leaves us with better logging for debugging, and makes it easy to capture other info from ec2-run-instances's output if we wish.",

If you sent SIGKILL to a process and that process was being debugged it would not kill the process. It would just pause it and notify the debugger that the process had received a signal, and tell the debugger which signal.The debugger could then allow the signal to go through to the process as is, or to replace it with another signal, or have it be ignored.I made a program that looked like sh in ps, but actually was a simple debugger that just ran a specific other processes of mine. When that process hit a signal the debugger poked the signal number into a fixed location in the process' memory, then changed the signal to something innocuous like SIGALRM, and let that be delivered.The process' SIGALRM handler would get the original signal number that the debugger had poked in, and print some obnoxious message like \"Stupid sysadmin...your wimpy SIGxxx cannot hurt me!\" where xxx was whatever signal someone had tried to send it.I then told my fellow admins I had a stuck process that I could not kill, and asked them to kill it.It took quite a while before someone got suspicious enough to suspect that the sh that was the parent of the \"stuck\" process wasn't actually a normal shell and try killing it.replychasil 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That is quite a story!replyarp242 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]POSIX says that \"setting a trap for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP produces undefined results\", but for signals it describes SIGKILL as \"Kill (cannot be caught or ignored)\".I'm guessing this is some relic from 80s Unix systems where SIGKILL behaved different, or perhaps just an inconsistency/oversight.replynerdponx 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I read that as undefined in terms of how the shell itself handles it, because the OS doesn't care.replyremram 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think it means that it is valid for OSes to return an error instead of doing nothing, if you attempt it.replytyingq 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You can't, though probably common for a parent to spin off a child and handle the SIGKILLed child via waitpid().replychasil 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]That's what they put on the ticket, so that's what I'm using, but you're probably right.replymike_hock 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]SIGABRT is also not a normal termination signal.

If it was, everyone would do it, because the benefit is that, eventually, you know every topic or section that appears in the bash man page, and then eventually you know most of what that page says about most of those features. These efforts compound over time. If you reach that point, you know that if you don't know of a feature in that software, it doesn't exist. You eventually get a shape of the feature set, often as it was intended to be used by the author of the tool.You can spend twice as much time over twice as many years reading random blog posts and googling, and you'll have no cohesive, comprehensive picture of the full tool and all its features. In this case, if you look at `man bash` and find the trap builtin function you'll learn about the DEBUG and ERR traps, for example, which I didn't see mentioned in the discussion here.

You can't assume at what point in the script it was running, so you have to test for different cases to find out what you now can/should do. Forget an edge case and now you've got an extra bug. Not using traps, it's clearer what happens at specific points in the execution of the rest of the code, so simpler to reason about how to deal with those cases as/where they happen.The second is different events can trigger an exit trap, and those may have different implications on what's going on.The third is there's parts of standards left out about what happens during/after a trap or when they get called, what data you have available, and different implementations can behave differently.Fourth is that sometimes people will use an exit trap to, say, report on a failure, but they may have lost context of what block they were in when it exited, and now the error reporting doesn't tell you everything you wanted to know.I can't remember more specifics atm because I stopped using them like a decade ago. I'll still use them to clean up temp files, but I also have to add the cleanup logic to the start of the script in case it didn't run.replypcthrowaway 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There's a bit more nuance in my opinion.If your cleanup logic is no more complicated than \"perform some cleanup whenever the script exits for any reason, without concern for what state the things to clean up are in\", I think trapping everything and calling the cleanup function is fine.If you have to do anything more complicated, it's probably a better idea to stick all that logic into a non-bash program. You can do it in Bash if you know what you're doing, but it's going to be ugly, hacky, error-prone, and tedious.  Not using traps, it's clearer what happens at specific points in the execution of the rest of the code, so simpler to reason about how to deal with those cases as/where they happen.You can stick all kinds of logic into the cleanup function, but again, it's ugly.  The second is different events can trigger an exit trap, and those may have different implications on what's going on.  The third is there's parts of standards left out about what happens during/after a trap or when they get called, what data you have available, and different implementations can behave differently.Which is why I think it's preferable not to do this in bash if you have any concern for why the program is exiting  Fourth is that sometimes people will use an exit trap to, say, report on a failure, but they may have lost context of what block they were in when it exited, and now the error reporting doesn't tell you everything you wanted to know.If you need any tracing, the only way this makes sense in bash is when running with -evx (errexit, verbose, trace) so you know exactly where you exited. This isn't always a bad idea, though -vx probably is most of the time.If you think you can do any complex logic in the trap function then you have to consider whether that logic might fail at any point, and depending on the signal there's a good chance you're on a clock as well.replyxmprt 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]As with most things in programming, it sounds like if you use the wrong tool for the wrong job, then you're prone to writing bugs.

Soon after, details emerged about the sub's non-standard design that did not meet regulations, including steering apparently handled by a $30 Logitech F710 wireless PC game controller from 2010.FURTHER READINGBiggest amateur-built sub sinks\u2014owner is suspected of killing passenger [Updated]Reuters reports that the five-person crew of the missing vessel, known as Titan, includes Hamish Harding, a British billionaire and adventure enthusiast, and OceanGate's founder and CEO, Stockton Rush. It disappeared on Sunday while on an expedition to explore the Titanic shipwreck site after losing contact with the Polar Prince research ship, roughly 1 hour and 45 minutes after their dive began.The submarine was last reported in the North Atlantic, approximately 900 miles east of Cape Cod, in a water body known to have a depth of about 13,000 feet. Search and rescue operations began shortly thereafter and are still underway. According to the BBC, the entire sub is bolted shut from the outside, so even if the vessel surfaces, the occupants cannot escape without outside assistance and could suffocate within the capsule.A CBS Sunday Morning segment where correspondent David Pogue joins Titanic enthusiasts who pay to ride in OceanGate's specially designed submersible vehicle. Originally broadcast November 27, 2022.As the potential disaster gripped social media, details about OceanGate's history of avoiding or complaining about safety regulations emerged. In particular, people began sharing a CBS Sunday Morning segment broadcast in November 2022 that shows reporter David Pogue visiting the Titan, which he later boarded for an expedition to the Titanic.During the CBS clip, Rush gives Pogue a tour of the sub, noting the presence of \"only one button\" in the entire vessel and saying that a sub \"should be like an elevator.\" Pogue also mentions how many pieces of the sub seem improvised, including off-the-shelf computer displays, a lighted overhead grab bar \"from Camper World,\" and using construction pipes as ballast. During that segment, Rush holds up a Logitech F710 Wireless controller that appears to have 3D-printed thumb-stick extensions and says, \"We run the whole thing with this game controller.\"AdvertisementEnlarge / A photo of the Logitech F710 gamepad aboard the Titan sub taken from OceanGate's Facebook page.OceanGateThe Logitech F710 controller, introduced in 2010, is a wireless dual-thumbstick gamepad for PCs that uses 2.4 GHz communications to a USB receiver. While its chunky design appears outdated by today's standards, it has been in continuous production for 13 years, and it usually sells for about $29.99 on Amazon.Shortly after news of the Logitech controller aboard the Titan spread on Tuesday morning, the Cheap Ass Gamer Twitter account, which regularly posts video game deals, posted an Amazon link to the Logitech F710 controller on Twitter, and the item quickly sold out.Enlarge / The Logitech F710 wireless gamepad seen on the Logitech website.LogitechLogitech Wireless Gamepad F710 - gamepad$34 AT LENOVO(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.)This is not the first time the Titan has gotten lost. On Monday, Pogue tweeted that during his report last summer about the Titan, the submersible got lost for a few hours as well (while Pogue was on the surface), although he later noted that during his trip, the sub still had contact with the surface, and in this situation, all communications contact with the sub have ceased.While the use of a $30 PC game controller for operations does not inspire confidence in the Titan's construction, the exact cause of the submarine's disappearance is currently unknown. Efforts are focused on locating the submarine and crew, after which an investigation will likely attempt to determine the cause of the incident.Authorities, fearing for the lives of the crew aboard, have deployed multiple resources (including sonar buoys and aircraft with underwater detection capabilities) to assist in the search operation. On Monday afternoon, the US Coast Guard estimated that the Titan may have about 70 to 96 hours of oxygen left.ARS VIDEOHow The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before ReleaseREADER COMMENTS504WITHBENJ EDWARDSBenj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars Technica.

    "content": "A daytime nap is good for the brainPublished1 day agocommentsCommentsShareIMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGESBy James GallagherHealth and science correspondentRegularly finding time for a little snooze is good for our brain and helps keep it bigger for longer, say University College London researchers.The team showed nappers' brains were 15 cubic centimetres (0.9 cubic inches) larger - equivalent to delaying ageing by between three and six years.However, the scientists recommend keeping naps to less than half an hour.But they said a daytime sleep was hard in many careers, with work culture often frowning on the practice.\"We are suggesting that everybody could potentially experience some benefit from napping,\" Dr Victoria Garfield told me. She described the findings as \"quite novel and quite exciting\".Napping has been shown to be critical for development when we are babies, becomes less common as we age and then goes through a resurgence in popularity after retirement, with 27% of people over 65 reporting having a daytime nap.Dr Garfield says advice to nap is \"something quite easy\" to do in comparison to weight loss or exercise which are \"difficult for a lot of people\".The brain naturally shrinks with age, but whether naps could help prevent diseases like Alzheimer's will still need extra research.Overall brain health is important for protecting against dementia and the condition is linked to disturbed sleep.The researchers suggest poor sleep is damaging the brain over time by causing inflammation and affecting the connections between brain cells.\"Thus, regular napping could protect against neurodegeneration by compensating for deficient sleep,\" researcher Valentina Paz said.However, Dr Garfield is not about to find a comfy spot to snooze at work and prefers other ways of looking after her brain.\"Honestly, I would rather spend 30 minutes exercising than napping, I'll probably try and recommend that my mum does it.\"10 tips for sleeping in hot weatherHow to find the answer?Studying napping can be a challenge.Napping might boost health, but the reverse is also true as your health can leave you so tired you need to nap more.So the researchers used a clever technique to prove that napping is beneficial.They used a gigantic natural experiment based on the DNA - the genetic code - with which we are born. Previous studies have identified 97 snippets of our DNA that either make us more likely to be nappers or to power through the day.So the team took data from 35,000 people, aged 40 to 69, taking part in the UK Biobank project and simply compared those genetic \"nappers\" and \"non-nappers\".The results, published in the journal Sleep Health, showed a 15 cubic centimetre difference - equivalent to 2.6 to 6.5 years of ageing. Total brain volumes were about 1,480 cubic centimetres in the study.\"I enjoy short naps on the weekends and this study has convinced me that I shouldn't feel lazy napping, it may even be protecting my brain,\" Prof Tara Spires-Jones, from the University of Edinburgh and the president of the British Neuroscience Association, told me.She said the \"interesting\" findings study showed a \"small but significant increase in brain volume\" and \"adds to the data indicating that sleep is important for brain health\".The researchers did not directly study having a big sleep in the middle of the day, but said the science pointed towards a cut off of half an hour.Follow James on Twitter.Related TopicsMedical researchSleepBrainView comments",

You prepare your body, your mind, relax all your muscles, determine what this session is about(relaxing), visualize something that helps you not get distracted and the next thing you know is you are deep into nothingness.And its smart to not stretch it beyond 20-25mins, our single sleep cycle generally is between 90-120mins, of which the first 20-25mins is the a first stages of non-REM sleep(this gets shorter after the first sleep cycle in a way) in which our body is relaxing but our mind relaxing but fairly active.

It loosens the bolts of the mind a bit. As long as you can stop attending to the signals of the outside world, you free up a little brain power to do a little relaxation/mental de-fragmentation. The problem is that sometimes people feel if they didn't drift off that it was a waste of their time (usually it's people who are always busy who feel the loss of 15 minutes as the most damaging), and feel worse off after. The key idea is to be able to up-regulate or down-regulate your mental energy expenditure per unit time (or 'power') as you feel necessary. If napping affects your sleep schedule negatively, it's because you feel it gives you too high an energy level at an inappropriate time, i.e. that it negatively affects your ability to manage your energy level better at will.replykqr 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]One of the things I learned from researching sleep in preparation of becoming a parent is that sleep is sleep. Rest is not sleep. To get the benefits of sleep, you have to sleep.Resting does give you benefits, but they are not those of sleep. You cannot replace sleep with rest and expect anything comparable.

There is also the theory that this benefited smaller societies since having a few people awake at all hours while others slept would have been good for noticing threats.Combining these two thoughts actually may be the answer - perhaps we are not biphasic but that few hour window in the middle of the night was driven by the night owls and the morning peoples drive to socialize with one another (sex, eating, etc as you say)replygpvos 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]We did that during the agrarian period before modern times, but evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers did not do it, or at least much less, instead staying up late at the camp fire.replysoligern 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Maybe in Europe.

I can start myself on a particular daydream, but pretty quickly my mind wanders off without me realising.

From what I read, even for bi-phasic or multi-phasic sleep to work one needs to have a routine of REM cycles that make up at least 6 REM cycles. So if you do 3 REM cycles at night and 2 and 1 later in the day, it should be same rather than doing 6 in one night and then 2-2-2 the other day.replyvidyesh 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think we light sleepers have conditioned our brain to work that way, generally the idea of a mid day nap is to get more energy to be able to do more.But I think what happens is (for me at least) if I take a nap I am fresh but it still feels like a mini-reset. I do not tend to get back to work immediately, my brain still needs some time to adjust to waking up mid day. So I have done less but feel relaxed and have too much energy to sleep early. Then I go to night owl mode, work and fall asleep 2-3am feeling very tired.So not ideal of night owls who thrive in the second half of the day, I guess?replyyoyohello13 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Are you saying naps lead to staying up later?

It lets you upload your music collection and stores it in Backblaze B2. It provides a simple web interface to listen to your collection, and support for the Subsonic API (allowing native apps to use it). Fundamentally it is not very different from something like Dropbox or Backblaze: it is a \"dumb\" backup that simply stores what you give it. It doesn't perform \"matching\" against other files, it doesn't allow you to access music you didn't explicitly upload, and it doesn't even deduplicate files between different users. It doesn't allow \"sharing\" of music either, download links are tied to a short access token for a specific user's login session. The only difference between other backup services is that we use the metadata tags in your uploads to organize things better. According to Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3Tunes, LLC, this is absolutely OK in the eyes of the law (thank you to a fellow HN user for telling me about this court case). Note that we don't even perform deduplication, which was the main controversy in that case.I have been using Stripe happily for a couple years now, but suddenly (less than 10 minutes after a subscription payment went through), Stripe decided that I violated their Restricted Business policy, in particular \"Products and services that infringe intellectual property rights: Sales or distribution of music, movies, software, or any other licensed materials without appropriate authorization\". I thought this was a misunderstanding so I clarified that we don't sell music, just storage space (see paragraph above), but they denied my appeal with a short template response.This saddens me because my reasons for starting the site are the exact opposite of piracy! I was sick of artists getting paid virtually nothing for streaming service plays, so I decided to buy full albums directly from the artist as much as I could. inter.tube just allows you to keep your collection safe and easily accessible.I'm posting this mostly to warn other Stripe users that essentially any backup service could \"violate\" these terms, so be careful about the marketing blurbs on your website. Probably any mention of \"music\" whatsoever is enough to get your account nuked. I really liked Stripe, always recommended it because of its nice API, but I won't be doing that anymore.inter.tube will likely die. I'm going to refund my few paying users and disable account registration later, I guess.As a bonus, I've open-sourced inter.tube. However, it is difficult to run because it relies on a bunch of random cloud services (Backblaze B2 + Cloudflare Workers + Lambda) and there's some hard-coded stuff in there, so it's probably not very useful beyond curiosity. If anyone would like to help me with the open sourcing, let me know, and I'll get back to you whenever I have time. Of course, feel free to fork it as well. I am also on GitHub sponsors if anyone would like to sponsor me to help make it easier to self-host (or at least self-deploy).Source code: https://github.com/guregu/intertubegrose 18 hours ago | next [\u2013]UPDATE 2: My Stripe account is back! Thank you so much! inter.tube will remain online, but open source from now on!Update: I have reached out to the nice Stripe employee who volunteered their email, let's see what happens.It's been pointed out a few times that my marketing says the site won't die, and me killing it would be very ironic. This is 100% true, and I have decided to leave the site up even if Stripe decides to ultimately close my account. Luckily, our infrastructure costs are very low (<$5 month currently).I created this site when Google Play Music went down and lots of people were complaining about Google killing yet another product. I don't want to do the same thing to my users.Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to plug a similar service that I am completely unrelated to.

There are no monthly gateway fees. The underwriting took about 3 weeks, but again I was very prompt in answering followup questions. I did not feel any additional headaches that I already did not anticipate due to the underwriting process. They did ask for a lot of documentation (that I totally expected them to ask and in my opinion is very relevant), licensing and such but again I am operating in a VERY regulated industry. They did want some clarification of business processes since they were not 100% familiar with selling guns online and in person.

For reference they exist since 2012 and have over 16k merchant account, including some big names in France (Veepee, Lastminute.com, ...) including some big names in business I feel like Stripe wouldn't touch (Dorcel store / adult toys and movies, Winamax and Pokerstar / online betting and poker, ...).replylagniappe 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> where there is an issue my experience has been that they talk to you to find a solution togetherProcessors take note, this is the way. btw, in person-to-person processing deals (which can provide APIs in most cases) this is just how it works.Note for business owners: Those annoying merchant services calls you get as a business owner, yes, those are the people to speak to. A bit of research into what interchange is, and what those rates are, and you can write your own contracts. It is exceedingly simple and as fine-grained as you'd like to make it (we are nerds, after all).

A lot are heuristics based, few are right out documented anywhere, but one example is # of credit card/account numbers bound to an account, another is structuring, i.e. a paytern of transaction activity specifically intended to avoid bank reporting controls. Or stupidly, putting words that are high risk w.r.t sanction compliance in memo fields, or getting a false positive OFAC hit.None of this is discussed with customers in a candid way; as a result it can feel very off putting. It's one of the things that bugs me about modern finance. It's too busy building itself into a governmental reporting mechanism, and far too prone to overreach through the exploitation of sanctioning mechanisms.It's one of those \"can't have nice things\" sorta bits.replydmurray 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There are also explicit laws forbidding telling your customers of your suspicions (\"tipping off\" in the context of money laundering).Of course, this doesn't mean your customer service agents should never be helpful and forthcoming, but it's easier and less risky to tell them to say nothing and burn the odd legit customer, rather than risk being on the wrong side of AML legislation.replyraincom 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If a mandatory reporter files a SAR, they are forbidden to share that info with customers.

It will not exist for long, because your company will be people who figured out they're not complying with various laws, so they will either disappear without a trace, or in the worst case scenario, take you down with them. You may end up having to explain to various authorities what you were doing.Or, you can work with one that's serious about AML/KYC compliance. This means sometimes your account gets flagged for suspicious activity, and you have to play by their rules to get it back. Depending on the provider, they may actually have some ways for you to get your account back, or they won't be bothered.Stripe is in the category of providers that will actually work with you to get your account back, but they're certainly not perfect. On the other hand, try something like Paypal and you're screwed. Or go with a different big player and find out how much nobody cares about you and the $40 a month of revenue you bring them.Every time I hear some horror story about Stripe, either the account is back up and running very quickly, or the business was doing something egregiously bad.

Financial service providers have enormous civil and criminal liability by tech company standards, and some regulations require them to use \"risk-based\" approaches to decline service to clients. The legal consequences of shutting out innocent small businesses are essentially nothing compared to the consequences of allowing a single criminal or terrorist to use their service.replyAnthonyMouse 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The regulations in practice do the opposite. Customers can easily issue charge backs, which puts the cost of fraud on the payment processor, which makes them too aggressive with the big red button. It costs them less to vaporize a small business than for their fraud prevention system to have a false negative.The right way to fix this is for something like Zelle to get a standardized payment request API. Then the merchant submits a payment request using the customer's email address (the only information the merchant needs from them, so no data breaches), and payments go through irreversibly if they haven't been contested in 30 days, or immediately if the customer affirmatively legitimates the payment on their bank's website/app because the merchant needs to be paid before delivering goods or services. (And payment requests from merchants the customer has never used before get denied after 30 days if not affirmatively legitimated.)That also removes the credit card fees because it's really a bank transfer.But where is it?replyryanmcdonough 18 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]\"think Google Play Music, except we won't disappear. currently in early access.\"You can't just give up at the first sign of a payment issue, otherwise you're no better than google ;)replygrose 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]You're right :).

There are people like me who wouldn't even consider using the service with it being closed, but it being open gets my attention. It would be absolutely bad ass if the official hosting solution could:- Let me put in a backblaze token and bucket name- Store all my uploads in the aforementioned bucket, in a format that I could switch back and forth between open source and hosted versionsI self host a ton of stuff but I'd gladly pay $10 to $15 a year for that service so I can easily switch to self-host in the future but don't have to manage yet-another-service. Given that the bulk of the expense would be backblaze and that would be paid for directly by me, that's almost entirely profit margin for you.I can see really neat future ideas along this line too, like possibly even point a (to be created in the future) desktop app like Strawberry straight at the bucket and have it play/download my music!replydanpalmer 19 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Did you have a Stripe account manager?

At the very least they might be able to give you a much more detailed explanation of which precise features are causing issue and how you could resolve those things.If not, why? Payments are a core part of any SaaS business, and it's important to have trust with important suppliers like that. Getting an account manager and proper business contract go a long way to preventing issues like this. It's somewhat unsurprising that Stripe don't have much trust for companies just signing up for the service as it's generally high risk for abuse.replygrose 19 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I don't. My MRR is $5 currently, peaked at around $40. I'm far too small for Stripe to care about me. I was running this as a passion project. I'm not sure how to even get an account manager (does it just happen if you become big enough to matter?)replydanpalmer 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Some companies will proactively reach out, others need to be reached out to. It's possible this is too small, but then again many pre-revenue startups will get this sort of treatment so it's not just about money.The thing to remember is that Stripe (or your cloud provider, or your email sending provider, or any other SaaS) get something out of that relationship \u2013 they get a sales channel, they can trust you more, they can lock you into their services, they can show you more of their value \u2013 these sorts of companies basically want these relationships. The fact you can sign up with a credit card and never talk to anyone is sort of just to appease devs that don't want to talk to anyone, it's not how they make money in the B2B market (it's a bit different for B2C or B2B-ish services like Squarespace).This project sounds pretty neat, and I could see it appealing to the audiophile market. I know people who would be interested.But, I'm sorry to say, it sounds like Stripe cancelling your service wasn't the biggest issue, but that the service never found its market. Looking at the site I couldn't tell what it was or who it was for, and it looked a bit dodgy. Copy like \"we're not google. we won't kill the site\" (said twice) makes it sound like a hobby rather than a company, and even if that's true, it's not going to go over well for marketing. Also, it's sadly somewhat ironic given that the service has indeed gone. I totally see the vibe you were going for, but I think that vibe is one that typically maxes out at a handful of friends using it.replygrose 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Thanks, I agree... it was never intended to be a \"real company\", which was ultimately to my detriment. The irony of killing it hurts, so I'll probably just leave it up for the existing users, and (hopefully) find some other payment processor. It only costs me a few dollars per month to host it, so I am not super worried about the money, but it's a huge motivation killer to be ousted from Stripe. I was happy with keeping it \"indie and scrappy\" and only friends using it, and I went through a lot of pains to make it so the architecture was always break-even, but I never expected my payment processor to bail on me.replydanpalmer 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah it's tough. I'd love for hobby projects to be able to be sustainable like this, but I understand that taking money comes with so much regulation and auditing throughout the whole stack (KYC, credit card companies, taxes, etc), so I can see why it's not always viable.replyjacquesm 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]At an MRR like that I wonder why you even bother with the payment service.

Metadata. Messy metadata.Typical solution imports 1/2 of my collection Ok, 1/4 with mangled metadata and 1/4 without metadata at all or can not import completely.Typical pain points:(1) Metadata contains \"Unknown Artist - Track01\", but filenames are Ok and all information can be extracted from file names.(2) It is FLAC, one file per Album, internal CUE and additional CUE file which references (absent) WAV file in same folder. Typical software duplicate such albums and one copy works, and other is \"Not found\" - and you must try to play to distinguish two. Some software can not understand embedded CUE at all, and show this as one big track + not-working album (because it can not find WAV referenced by CUE).(3) FLAC, file per track, with per-track metadata, and CUE which reference all these files to add proper between-track pauses. Typical result: two identical albums. Often such CUE is rejected as \"invalid\" (because such CUE are \"non-standard\" extension invented by Exact Audio Copy software), and then it is Ok, but - see next item.(4) FLAC, flile per track, files doesn't contain any metadata, but there is CUE which reference all these files. It works Ok, if CUE is not rejected as invalid, and, again becomes \"Unknown Author - Unknown Album - Track N\" if CUE was rejected (often).(5) Same as 2-4 with APE, WavePack or TTA (do you know this format?) instead of FLAC.(6) Such monstrosity as ISO9660 image which contains WavePack file (one, whole album), CUE, LOG, some JPEGs.

Looks like only foobar2000 on Windows can show such container properly, as one album packed with WavePack.(7) ID3v1 with some non-latin characters in some 8 bit codepage (typically Win-1251 Cyrillic, but not always).(8) ID3v1 with UTF-8 characters.(9) ID3v2 with non-UTF-8 national characters.(10) CUE files in single-byte codepages and not UTF-8 / CUE files in UTF-8.

In hindsight in this case, one could argue but no.Instead, we need to hold Stripe responsible to do a better due diligence upfront if they want to do business with these small indie hackers.

    "content": "Style your RSS feedPublished on 20 Jun 2023 inrssblogRSS is not dead. It is not mainstream, but it's still a thriving protocol, especially among tech users. However, many people do not know what RSS feeds are or how to use them. Most browsers render RSS as raw XML files, which doesn't help users understand what it's all about:In this post, I'll explain how to style RSS feeds and educate readers at the same time.XSL(T) to the rescueThis is how the RSS feed for this blog looks like:To style a raw XML file in a browser, you have to provide styling information. You can do that by attaching an xml-stylesheet processing instruction within the RSS feed:<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><?xml-stylesheet href=\"/rss.xsl\" type=\"text/xsl\"?><feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"   xmlns:media=\"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/\"> ...</feed>The href attribute specifies a URL to a valid XSL file. You can check out mine for inspiration. Here's the gist:<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><xsl:stylesheet version=\"3.0\"        xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"        xmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <xsl:output method=\"html\" version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" indent=\"yes\"/> <xsl:template match=\"/\"> <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" lang=\"en\">  <head>   <title>    RSS Feed | <xsl:value-of select=\"/atom:feed/atom:title\"/>   </title>   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/assets/styles.css\"/>  </head>  <body>   <p>    This is an RSS feed. Visit    <a href=\"https://aboutfeeds.com\">About Feeds</a>    to learn more and get started. It\u2019s free.   </p>   <h1>Recent blog posts</h1>   <xsl:for-each select=\"/atom:feed/atom:entry\">    <a>     <xsl:attribute name=\"href\">      <xsl:value-of select=\"atom:link/@href\"/>     </xsl:attribute>     <xsl:value-of select=\"atom:title\"/>    </a>    Last updated:    <xsl:value-of select=\"substring(atom:updated, 0, 11)\" />   </xsl:for-each>  </body>  </html> </xsl:template></xsl:stylesheet>This code is inspired by pretty-feed-v3, but I've adopted it for the Atom specification.The XSL file transforms the XML feed into a valid HTML document that any browser can render. You can use any information included in the XML file and put it into a new markup structure. You can even include content that is not part of the XML feed. A perfect use case is to include a note about what RSS feeds are and how to use them (as shown in the example above).You can define inline CSS styles with a regular <style> element, but it's also possible to import external CSS files. I've imported my blog's main CSS stylesheet, so I didn't have to write any new code to make the RSS feed match my blog's design.It's also possible to use XSLT functions to alter values. Here's how I truncate the timestamp to display only the date:<!-- Full timestamp --><xsl:value-of select=\"atom:updated\" /><!-- Date only --><xsl:value-of select=\"substring(atom:updated, 0, 11)\" />The browser support for XSL transformations is great; unsupported browsers will fall back to the default behavior (progressive enhancement).ExamplesHere are some styled RSS feeds you can check for inspiration:This blogMy photography websiteBBC NewsHsiaoming YangDave RupertOli WarnerThe XSL files are public, so you can check how those pages have been implemented.SitemapYou can apply XSL files to any XML file. Another use case for styled XML files is a website sitemap. Although sitemaps are meant to be consumed by machines (e.g. crawlers), you can style them with little effort. See hn.cho.shmap and the respective XSL file as an example. Here's the gist:<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><xsl:stylesheet version=\"3.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"        xmlns:sitemap=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\"> <xsl:output method=\"html\" version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" indent=\"yes\"/> <xsl:template match=\"/\">  <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" lang=\"en\">   <body>    <h1>Sitemap</h1>    <xsl:for-each select=\"/sitemap:urlset/sitemap:url\">     <a>      <xsl:attribute name=\"href\">       <xsl:value-of select=\"sitemap:loc\"/>      </xsl:attribute>      <xsl:value-of select=\"sitemap:loc\"/>     </a>     Last updated:     <xsl:value-of select=\"substring(sitemap:lastmod, 0, 11)\" />    </xsl:for-each>   </body>  </html> </xsl:template></xsl:stylesheet>ConclusionI love RSS, and \u2014 according to my stats \u2014 many of my readers love it, too. With all the social media walled gardens, I hope for RSS to become more popular. By providing a custom XSL file, you can make your RSS feed look nice and include some information about what RSS actually is.Related postsEstimating the number of your RSS subscribers",

But `text/xml` is technically not the correct content type for RSS feeds, `application/rss+xml` is; and when you serve it with that content type, browsers typically either open a download window instead of rendering the feed, or they render it as plain text without styling.So you're stuck. Have a styled feed but serve it with the wrong content type, or be technically correct and serve it with the right content type, but no styling for you.Practically, content type really doesn't matter that much, and most (all?) RSS readers are fine with `text/xml`. But for those of us who like to be technically correct...[0] https://standardebooks.org/feeds/rss/new-releasesreplyidbehold 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Content negotiation is a thing that should be used. My browser sends this in the request headers when I open up one of those RSS links:  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8Which means it would prefer to get a response from the server in (basically) the order shown, but it will accept any response type (*/*). So ideally the server would be using that information and making the decision to serve the RSS feed as application/xml instead of application/rss+xml. AFAIK if the \"subtype\" (rss+xml in this case) has a + in it, then it basically means it conforms to the format after the + (e.g. application/xml) and thus is just providing a bit more context, but is still valid as the more generic version.Though I do think the browser should also keep that same thing in mind and attempt to render any application/whatever+xml in its XML renderer.Edit: another thing you could try to add this response header:  Content-Disposition: inlinereplyacabal 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's a great idea.

But then you ran into things that's simple with other solutions, like re-formatting dates and ended up with either humongous functions or biting the bullet and including multiple pre-formatted versions in the XML, and the moment you start down either of those paths you start to dislike XSLT pretty quickly.In a way modern React etc. frontends can be seen as a \"fix\", in the sense that at least it means most sites effectively have APIs, whether or not they officially expose them to users, but without the pain of XSLT. If they support server side rendering as well, they're getting close to what we were doing.And that was the original driver for the site design I mentioned - every URL was an API endpoint with a well defined set of expectations, letting you effectively explore the API by browsing the site as normal until you had sliced and diced the data the way you wanted and then just add a parameter to get it in the format you wanted (just as you can with Reddit - e.g. append \".json\" or \".rss\"). And I try to do that as much as possible still.replylmm 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yep.

People have spent/wasted twenty years rebuilding templating systems in JavaScript. Browsers have had it all along but because it's related to XML it seems web devs' brains just seize up thinking that's only used by boring old Enterprise development.To be more charitable I think the problem has always been tooling. There's not a lot of good design tools that have supported XSL stylesheets as output. You've always had to do a lot of manual editing to get make a decent stylesheet and do any complicated functions.What's annoying is XSL can be used for any XML documents like you said. Your \"pages\" could just be serialized database entries with a stylesheet on them. Since all the styling was done client side the server is really just an API server.This was a design conceit of ATOM. It was mostly used for syndication but it was meant to be an XML API interface. It supported posting to a server in the ATOM XML definition as well as pulling. The idea being you'd come across a server with an ATOM API and be able to post comments or whatever to it right from a browser, no HTML form or JavaScript required.replythrow0101a 22 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]> RSS is not dead.

Having a signal that an article is there with even the slightest amount of context is so much better than the alternative.It's mildly annoying to visit a site for the full text (with your ad blocker), but signing up for newsletters etc. from each site one-by-one is really painful.If I'm going to take 5+ minutes to really read something, it's OK to visit the site. That means something is interesting or relevant enough to invest my time in. That signal can usually be gleaned from a title and short paragraph. Compared to the number of new things published every day, it's relatively rare to find things worth those 5+ minutes.From what I can gather, many people use RSS readers to follow 5-10 feeds, and they slowly look through and read most of the articles. It serves as a convenient way to follow their top few sites and maybe a few aggregators like HN. Other people track 100s of feeds and quickly scan what's happening, only diving into something if it's interesting or important.I'm building a service for the second type of person (mainly because I'm that type of person, TBH).

That service could be a very low cost monthly subscription thing plus a FOSS option that you could run on a cheap VPS, etc.24/7 services are also essential for generating notifications when something in a filter is spotted, being able to have an email gateway, doing things like POSTing items to other sites automatically, etc.Making that \"full\" service FOSS is not in the near term plans, though. This is a distributed system that has run 100s of millions of jobs already, has a very specific security and monitoring setup, uses a number of queues and databases, etc. From my past experience, it's really hard to support people with on-premises distributed systems software like this (FOSS or not).

Web servers only serve the blobs like images and other media. Content Management is done by combining rss feeds according to site hierarchy via an enhanced OPML dialect, also parsed client side. One or more feeds per page. Some pages show only the newest entry, others show the first ten with pagination, or all entries. This is configured via the OPML dialect. The data sources of a website can be completely federated. A machine readable licensing system enables integration of content from third parties on your site \u2014 without any backend changes! Social networks are basically thousands or millions of different sources in one huge OPML file plus some intelligence in the XSLT. Efficient caching on the network allows for very small and cheap servers for every content creator.

I\u2019ve also deployed almost exactly the same stylesheet in one or two other places, e.g. https://ganintegrity.com/blog/feed.xml which also demonstrates pagination (very uncommonly encountered, and I have no idea of feed reader support, but a useful concept that allows you to keep your feed file small while still (at least nominally) containing all the historical entries).My XSL stylesheet is rather fancy in what it supports. Sometimes because I actually use that fanciness (e.g. supporting HTML in all text constructs, not just <atom:content>, because I use HTML titles), sometimes just for the sake of correctness or completeness (e.g. passing through xml:lang as a lang attribute, or more obscure elements like atom:rights), and sometimes for things that I might use some day but haven\u2019t yet (e.g. turning audio/video enclosures into <audio>/<video> elements, for podcasts). https://chrismorgan.info/atom.xsl is for Atom, and I\u2019ve also written an RSS variant of it, purely for use in podcasts since podcasts are stupidly stuck with RSS (and it\u2019s almost all Apple\u2019s fault and I hate it): https://temp.chrismorgan.info/2022-05-10-rss.xsl.Developing using XSLT is an interesting throwback to how web development used to be, because this stuff is basically frozen as it was twenty years ago. Almost all errors are fatal, diagnostics vary between nonexistent and poor (remember when you basically had to bisect to figure out what precisely broke things?), and the dev tools you\u2019ve grown used to can\u2019t help you when anything goes wrong. Also there are probably more bugs than there used to be. And documentation is bad (a lot of load-bearing functionality is completely undocumented). And browsers are much more inconsistent in their behaviour than you\u2019ve grown used to (welcome back to the days of enforced trial and error, and having to check things in multiple browsers). (You get some of the same weirdnesses if you try shipping HTML using XML syntax, but it\u2019s mostly XSLT-specific.)Some particular issues:\u2022 The stylesheet needs client-side JavaScript to render any type=\"html\" content (HTML serialised as text), because Firefox doesn\u2019t support the (admittedly optional) disable-output-escaping=\"yes\" XSLT feature. (I\u2019m puzzled by this lack even when using <xsl:output method=\"html\"/>\u2014and yes, Firefox and Chromium do both produce HTML-syntax documents in this case, not XML-syntax documents. I check this by searching for an xmlns attribute an all elements\u2019 outerHTML, not sure if there\u2019s a more direct check and I\u2019d love it if someone knew one, \u2019cos this stuff regularly matters in JavaScript libraries\u2014loads of libraries will break if run in an XML-syntax document due to assumptions made that no longer hold. OK, enough of this long parenthesis.) Therefore I recommend using XML syntax for the HTML instead (type=\"xhtml\" in Atom, no equivalent in RSS because RSS is a disaster), and expect to do so for whatever next refresh I do of my own website.\u2022 The stylesheet needs client-side JavaScript to resolve URLs if you use xml:base, since browsers just don\u2019t support that at all any more (if they ever did?).\u2022 If you make an error in the XSLT, Firefox will often point to exactly where the error is, but just as often give a completely useless generic old-school XML parse error screen. It validates declared XSLT 1.0 stylesheets, and is all round not very forgiving of errors, which is good, except that I wish the error reporting was more reliable.\u2022 Chromium is more forgiving of errors, mostly for the worse, blithely ignoring some XSLT 1.0 errors that you really wish it would point out because you have certainly done something wrong. On errors it won\u2019t overlook, it will leave you with an document empty save for an xml-stylesheet ProcessingInstruction, not put anything in the dev tools console, and print the error to stderr (and with no stack trace in the XML or XSLT, which is painful)\u2014I\u2019m mildly surprised with myself that I even thought to run it in a terminal to see if there was any output there, but I guess I was getting desperate one time when everything was working fine in Firefox but not in Chromium.\u2022 In Firefox, pages that use XSLT will sometimes just hang during loading (seems to happen very often, maybe even always?, when it\u2019s the first navigation in a new tab). Haven\u2019t ever filed a bug about this. My wild guess is that this probably started happening at some point in the switch to a multi-process architecture.\u2022 If you reload the page in Firefox while the dev tools are open, the dev tools are now effectively dead until you close and reopen them. Bear in mind also that the dev tools operate on the post-transform document, not on the source XML. Haven\u2019t ever filed a bug about this.If you try working on this stuff, you\u2019ll want to keep a copy of the XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 specs open. They\u2019re the best documentation you\u2019re likely to find, and honestly pretty good. Because each is a single document, you can search through for keywords nice and easily.I\u2019ve been very tempted to try shipping a website where pages are Atom documents (the list, a feed document, and individual pages entry documents), mostly just for fun, but I\u2019d want to inspect browser support more carefully before doing this, and I\u2019d need to nail down that Firefox hang first too.replyaendruk 19 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Here\u2019s the 22-year-old Firefox bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98168And try putting xml:base on the atom:content tag.replychrismorgan 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> And try putting xml:base on the atom:content tag.I\u2019m not sure what you mean. xml:base is supposed to work everywhere, for whatever is the appropriate scope, and my stylesheet copies the xml:base attribute across, and then includes JavaScript to make it more or less work, wherever you use it, since browsers don\u2019t support xml:base at all any more.replyjulik 12 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]XSLT... it's been a while I've seen thatreplyTheRealDunkirk 18 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]No.replydmje 21 hours ago | prev [\u2013]\"Oh great, XSLT\" said no-one, literally everreplyGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | ContactSearch:",

Additionally the X button is not labelled unless you o haver over it after which it says \"Not interested.\" If it were permanent people may accidently click this button and then they will never be recommended shorts even if they enjoy them. People's opinions about shorts way change over time. After a month they may actually want to engage with the format. Having to go search through some menu buried somewhere to enable shorts on the home page again is not user friendly.Being able to do exploration is an important part of recommendation systems.

Saving a minuscule amount money by reducing views of less-cached long-tail content doesn't seem important enough.

That is something that is happening, just in miniscule amounts. So YouTube introduced brand safety options which predict how safe a video is and avoids such potential headlines.However since it's just an algorithm, it doesn't understand nuance.

In this way, I can follow the development processes of the channels and create insight.replyatsuyatakagi 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This is exactly why I created a site to search/sort specific YouTube creators' videos [0], but I guess it's good that they listened to end-users :)[0]: https://holosearch.xyzreplygoda90 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I wouldn't be surprised if it disappeared again. Playback speed briefly appeared on the Android TV app, then disappeared for good with no explanation.replySllX 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Doesn\u2019t seem to have hit the iPad app yet and I don\u2019t have any updates pending at the moment, but this is still excellent news. Thanks for the heads up!replyabnry 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Does anyone have any self hosted YouTube __playlist__ recommendations? Downloading tends to be the focus and that isn't important to me. I like to save videos for later with my watch later playlist, but it is unmanageable. Not easy to delete or sort or search. YouTube could be so much better in terms of playlist management.replystefanos82 10 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The best suggestion for you would be to use SMplayer and create a new playlist in it with the video links you want to watch later and never fear of messing things up.It uses either youtube-dl or yt-dlp behind the scenes for playing the videos while downloading them on the fly, so it works flawlessly in cases like yours.replyjohnchristopher 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]OT: I wish there was a way to create a playlist from music youtube suggestions. I am losing some good things when accidentally closing a tab.replystefanos82 11 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I use Firefox and more than often I restore last closed tabs (by mistake like you!) with Ctrl+Shift+T.Of course, there's History and \"Restore Previous Session\" which saves you from countless nightmares when the next time you boot your computer you want to restore what you last viewed or had opened.It helps immensely!replyjohnchristopher 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Youtube music will replace the playlist with new suggestions (it makes a new playlist with the first song being the one that was playing or on pause when the tab was closed), so even though the tab gets restored its content doesn't.Mixes and user playlist are different from suggestion playlists.replystefanos82 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> OT: I wish there was a way to create a playlist from music youtube suggestions. I am losing some good things when accidentally closing a tab.How about hover on each suggestion and add it to \"Watch Later\" or even Queue? That also works, at least for me.replyjohnchristopher 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Well, this becomes old fast :). I usually have to click 40 songs and add them to a new playlist. There are some firefox extension that can extract URL and rebuild playlist but they are a bit buggy.replybelfalas 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I see the option in their mobile app as well.replysubarctic 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Oh, you mean for a specific channel - I thought you meant you could sort search results by oldest. Well, that's still better than not having it.replyspirit557 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Not for me yet, tried with a clean profile too. I have been missing this simple option a lotreplylegrande 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Still no way to see how many videos are in a channel though? Unless I need to pay more attention.replyiamevn 11 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]On the android app at least, the video count is next to subscriber count below the name and above the description on the channel's page.replystefanos82 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It can be found on top of the channel of your choice, right below channel name, right next to channel @ChannelName.replyvondur 8 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I\u2019d live to be able to favorite or organize my subscriptions.replyLeoNatan25 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I have it, and it certainly wasn't there yesterday.

If a channel has a lot of videos, \"Oldest\" is no better than \"Latest\".replyblondin 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]i see it too.i have sent numerous feedback asking for a sort by length in playlists. that feature doesn't seem to align with their vision of good playlist management somehow.replyDoesntMatter22 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]That's fantastic to hear.replypaulpauper 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Maybe it is to maximize revenue. older videos are less profitable for google compared to newer ones .replyjamcrimer 11 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]so you're saying they're disabling the feature of \"not being able to watch old videos\" to maximize revenue?replywruza 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Idk, but I\u2019ve noticed that many old non-popular videos take time to load or seek.
