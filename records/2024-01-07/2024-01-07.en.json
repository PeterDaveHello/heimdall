Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 made an emergency landing after a panel on the side of the plane blew off midflight. Alaska and United Airlines said late Saturday that they were grounding their entire fleets of Boeing 737 Max 9s. In this article UAL ALK BA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Passenger oxygen masks hang from the roof next to a missing window and a portion of a side wall of an Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which had been bound for Ontario, California and suffered depressurization soon after departing, in Portland, Oregon, U.S., on Jan. 5, 2024, in this picture obtained from social media. Instagram/@strawberrvyInstagram/@strawberrvy Via Reute The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered a temporary grounding of dozens of Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft for inspections, a day after a piece of the aircraft blew out in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight. Images and video of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 that were shared on social media showed a gaping hole on the side of the plane and passengers using oxygen masks before it returned to Portland shortly after taking off for Ontario, California, on Friday afternoon. The FAA's emergency airworthiness directive will affect about 171 planes worldwide and applies to U.S. airlines and carriers operating in U.S. territory, the agency said. Alaska and United Airlines said late Saturday that they were grounding their entire fleets of Boeing 737 Max 9s. No serious injuries were reported on the flight, according to federal safety officials. There were 171 passengers and six crewmembers on board, Alaska Air said. \"Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB's investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,\" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement. Large-scale groundings of aircraft by the FAA or other aviation authorities are rare. The FAA has heavily scrutinized the Boeing 737 Max since two fatal crashes grounded the jetliner worldwide almost five years ago. Two other models of the Max, the smallest and largest version, have not yet been cleared by the agency to enter commercial service. The section of the fuselage missing appeared to correspond to an exit not used by Alaska Airlines, or other carriers that don't have high-density seating configurations, and was plugged. The National Transportation Safety Board has started its investigation. Chair Jennifer Homendy, at a press briefing in Portland Saturday night, asked the public for help in finding the plane's missing door. Homendy said no passengers were seated at the seat closest to the panel or the middle seat in the row where the door blew out and added that it was fortunate that the plane was still climbing and not at cruising altitude when travelers and crew could have been standing or walking through the cabin. \"We could have ended up with something more tragic,\" she said. The incident was described as \"an explosive decompression at the window exit,\" according to Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the labor union that represents Alaska's cabin crew and flight attendants at United, Spirit and other carriers. Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said such an incident is extremely rare. \"Rapid decompression is a serious matter,\" he said. \"To see a gaping hole in an aircraft is not something we typically see. In aviation safety, we would call this a structural failure.\" The incident is also a reminder to keep your seatbelt fastened when seated, he added. \"I always advise people on a commercial aircraft, keep your seatbelt on regardless of what the light says,\" Brickhouse said. Before the FAA issued its directive, Alaska Airlines earlier said it would ground its fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. On Saturday, the carrier said 18 of the planes \"had in-depth and thorough plug door inspections performed as part of a recent heavy maintenance visit,\" but later said it would temporarily ground them all. \"We are in touch with the FAA to determine what, if any, further work is required before these aircraft are returned to service,\" Alaska said. As of 7 p.m. ET, Alaska said it canceled 160 flights, affecting 23,000 customers. Investigation begins The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to Portland on Saturday to investigate the incident. United Airlines , the largest operator of the planes in the U.S., had prepared to ground dozens of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft for inspections, CNBC reported earlier. The carrier said late Saturday that it had grounded its entire fleet of 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, after earlier saying 30 of the planes had already satisfied the FAA's inspection requirement. The FAA said the inspections will take between four and eight hours per plane. The Boeing 737 Max 9 is a larger version of Boeing's best-selling jetliner, the 737 Max 8. Max planes were grounded worldwide in 2019 after two fatal crashes within about five months of one another. The U.S. lifted its flight ban on the jets in late 2020 after software and training updates. Plugged door The Boeing 737 Max 9 has an emergency exit door cut behind the wings for use in dense seating cabin configurations, like those used by budget airlines, according to Flightradar24. \"The doors are not activated on Alaska Airlines aircraft and are permanently 'plugged,'\" Flightradar24 said. Boeing didn't comment beyond its statement when asked about the sealed emergency exit door. Spirit AeroSystems , which makes the fuselages for the planes, referred CNBC to Boeing when asked about the incident. \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,\" Boeing said in a statement on Saturday. \"We agree with and fully support the FAA's decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.\" The company said it is supporting the NTSB's investigation. There are 215 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in service worldwide, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. In addition to United and Alaska Air, other operators include Aeromexico, Turkish Airlines, Icelandair and Panama's Copa Airlines. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines operate the smaller 737 Max 8. Late last year, Boeing urged airlines to inspect aircraft for a \"possible\" loose bolt in the rudder control system, the latest in a series of manufacturing flaws on Boeing jets that have prompted additional inspections, and slowed deliveries of the jets.

They were getting pressurization warnings on prior flights, but the only action they took was restricting the plane from flying ETOPS routes.They&#x27;re the dominant carrier in my area, so these sorts of screwups make me nervous. I can&#x27;t easily avoid using them without a fair amount of inconvenience. reply Miraste 13 hours agoparentI haven&#x27;t trusted Alaska since the Flight 261 crash, where they failed to do basic maintenance for so long that the screw threads in the stabilizer system wore away and locked the plane in the \"straight down\" orientation. And fired and sued a mechanic who reported the problem. 100% fatalities. reply mertd 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s more than two decades ago. People involved must have long left the company. They might even be working for other airlines. reply schiffern 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not how organizations work. You can&#x27;t just slowly take out the \"bad\" people and replace them with \"good\" people and expect that to fix anything. It&#x27;s the wrong mental model.Organizations are sticky. They get stuck in a rut, basically. The slow trickle of new people gets indoctrinated into the Company Way (or else selectively ejected), and the people that are able to leave often use it as a lesson of what not to do.In short, turnover isn&#x27;t a magic bullet. reply TylerE 7 hours agorootparentWhat do you call 8 bad cops and two good cops sitting at a table? Ten bad cops. Actual good cops wouldnât associate with bad cops. reply thatwasunusual 12 hours agorootparentprev> They might even be working for other airlines.They are part of management now. ;) reply csours 13 hours agoparentprevThings like this are always alarming until you learn the base rate. Unfortunately, I cannot find a quick reference for this, but many many flights take off with some anomaly noted in the technical log book. reply SoftTalker 12 hours agorootparentYes, it&#x27;s actually an FAA approved document for each aircraft type called the Mimimum Equipment List (MEL). It defines which non-critical equipment is permitted to be inoperative and not prevent dispatch of the aircraft.Commercial aviation would come to a halt if every aircraft had to be in 100% perfect condition for every flight. There are many systems that have redundant backups or are not essential for safe flight. reply pc86 10 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a joke about asking skydivers why they&#x27;d jump out of a perfectly good airplane and the punch line is that there is no such thing as a perfectly good airplane.Every single plane has things that are broken, things that are inoperative, things that behave slightly out of tolerance. This is true for commercial aircraft the whole way down to single engine trainers. 172s are notorious for having fuel gauges that are basically only good for telling you how many fuel tanks you have and not anything related to quantity of fuel on the plane. reply thfuran 13 hours agorootparentprevAnd it&#x27;s not like driving is especially safe. It&#x27;s just that traffic deaths are so routine that they&#x27;re not generally widely reported, while pretty much every major issue with an airplane gets national attention. In the US, traffic deaths amount to the equivalent of a fully loaded 747 lost with all hands every couple days. reply laweijfmvo 13 hours agorootparentWhether itâs true or not, I feel like I control my fate when driving a lot more than when flying. I can take precautions (defensive driving, avoiding bad conditions, etc.) but have little to no control once I board a plane. reply mattmaroon 12 hours agorootparentIt is true that you control your fate more when driving. Once the door shuts on the plane you have little ability to do anything other than get yourself arrested.Thatâs part of WHY air travel is safer. reply bmitc 9 hours agorootparentI like to consider what is safer when something goes wromg. Are there statistics that track this across different modes of travel? reply rightbyte 8 hours agorootparentYour car won&#x27;t fall out of the sky in the event of a malfunction so I guess cars are safer \"when something goes wrong\"? Then again cars travel with less margin of error to other cars and objects than airplanes. reply thfuran 6 hours agorootparentAn airplane falling out the sky is something like the equivalent of the wheels falling off of a car traveling at speed. It&#x27;s not that it can&#x27;t happen, but it&#x27;s hardly the only possible result of a malfunction. reply cereal_cable 43 minutes agorootparentThere&#x27;s also a giant speed difference plus the fact that a car will decelerate even if uncontrollably for basically any mechanical failure. Even at speed vehicle accidents are quite safe comparatively to a plane that has lost its ability to fly. A plane tends to have all or nothing incidents while vehicles have lots of accidents with a wide variety of severity.Naturally that tends to push aviation towards avoidance of mechanical issues and on cars we are much more tolerant. I&#x27;ve seen people driving cars with their door duck taped on! reply TylerE 7 hours agorootparentprevYes. Airplanes are literally hundreds of times less likely to kill you per mile than cars. There has not been a single US airline fatality since 2009. reply ixs 4 hours agorootparentSouthwest 1380 would like a word with you.Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 was a Boeing 737-700 that experienced an uncontained engine failure[a] in the left CFM56-7B engine after departing from New YorkâLaGuardia Airport en route to Dallas Love Field on April 17, 2018. [â¦] One passenger was partially ejected from the aircraft and sustained fatal injuries[â¦]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Southwest_Airlines_Flight_13... reply vladms 4 hours agorootparentBased on this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airlines.org&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;safety-record-of-u-s-air-ca... between 2009 and 2021 there were indeed 2. I think that the point stands, it is very impressive and safe. reply bmitc 2 hours agorootparentWikipedia says 51.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_fatal_accidents_and_...The numbers would go up quite a bit if it included private and military. The numbers you linked to seem to have a very tight definition of which flights were considered, as the Wikipedia list showcases several more in-flight deaths involving air carrier class airplanes than just two. reply bmitc 3 hours agorootparentprevAirplanes are inherently much, much less reliable than cars and only reach reliability through however many millions or billions of dollars worth of redundant systems and maintenance intervals and however many man-hours. That means that when you get on an airplane, you are extremely reliant on those systems and processes having been followed.We are seeing more and more that these systems and processes have been breaking down, from regulation to manufacturing to pilots to systems to maintenance.It really is hard to compare, but for an airplane, a passenger has to have faith that literally hundreds of thousands of people and things have done their job correctly. When I drive my car, I am much less reliant on people, systems, and processes, as cars are just plain simple. Most leople barely change their oil or check tire pressure. I even once had a complete engine failure and was able to just roll to a stop from highway speeds. Furthermore, I am in control. If I am too tired, I don&#x27;t drive. I can pay attention to other drivers. I am directly responsible for maintenance. Etc.I think it&#x27;s hard to compare airplanes to cars by numbers alone. There are subtleties that are not exposed by numbers.For an airplane passenger, it is absolutely a risk. You rely on so much happening correctly, and you are not in control of any of it. As little bits in that chain of things that need to happen don&#x27;t happen correctly, percentages of failure and death go way up, and fast.And we haven&#x27;t even discussed in-flight medical emergencies, as there are actually quite a few in-flight deaths every year that would likely not yield a death if the medical emergency happened on the ground.> There has not been a single US airline fatality since 2009.Wikipedia says there has been 51, not counting private or military. And that list doesnt include American aircraft flying overseas, to which the MAX planes would add hundreds.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_fatal_accidents_and_... reply Roark66 1 hour agorootparentAnd that is why I think it is absolutely, mind bogglingly bonkers that Tesla is currently using \"drive by wire\" in a mass production car when this technology is not common in aviation at all. Only the huge airliners that benefit from extremely expensive maintenance schedules use full \"fly by wire\". reply TylerE 42 minutes agorootparentEvery Airbus built in the last 40 years is fly by wire. reply TylerE 1 hour agorootparentprevPlane Operated by a US Airline != Plane Manufactured in the US reply bbarnett 32 minutes agorootparentprevAirplanes are literally hundreds of times less likely to kill you per mile than carsA weird metric. I&#x27;d prefer travel time, not per mile.Still far safer. reply dkjaudyeqooe 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen someone runs a red light at speed and t-bones you on your left you&#x27;re dead no matter how defensively you drive.The illusion of control doesn&#x27;t change your odds much. reply bmitc 9 hours agorootparentEven then, that is a scenario that you can train to look for. I often look both ways before taking off on a green. reply vc8f6vVV 10 hours agorootparentprevIt does change odds. So when considering defensive driving the rule \"flying is safer\" may not hold. reply peter422 9 hours agorootparentThere is no amount of defensive driving you can do that would make driving safer than flying commercial. reply mitthrowaway2 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s certainly true in the sense that flying from NYC to LA is 750x safer than doing the same as a road trip, on a fatalities-per-km basis. But on a per-trip basis, boarding that flight will be about equally as safe as taking a 5 km trip by car to the hardware store, and above-average defensive driving can certainly boost that radius considerably, maybe to 50 km.Some would argue the per-trip comparison is invalid, but often the travel distance is not fixed, such as if you were weighing between vacation options of flying to NYC vs camping at a local campsite.On a danger-per-hour-in-vehicle basis, airplanes of course still come out ahead, although not quite as overwhelmingly. NYC to LA is about a 5.5 hour flight; an equivalent drive would be about 350 km, and it will be very hard to match the safety of that flight even with defensive driving. You&#x27;d need to drive 70x better than average, even with the fatigue of a 5.5 hour drive. reply cedilla 9 hours agorootparentprevFlying is safer by several orders of magnitude. Especially in the US. reply vc8f6vVV 8 hours agorootparentLet&#x27;s do some math, shall we?> In 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board estimated a total of nearly 24 million flight hours. Of these 24 million hours, 6.84 of every 100,000 flight hours yielded an airplane crash, and 1.19 of every 100,000 yielded a fatal crash. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psbr.law&#x2F;aviation_accident_statistics.htmlSo we have 330M people in the US, of which let&#x27;s say 100M are driving regularly. How regularly? Let&#x27;s assume 2 hours a day for 52x5 = 260 working days in a year. So given that we have 43K traffic fatalities per year let&#x27;s compute fatalities per hour of driving. 100M * 2 * 260 &#x2F; 43K = 1.2M So we have 1 fatality per 1.2M hours of driving. At the same time we have roughly 1 fatality per 100K hours of flying. Oops!Of course one should consider that:(a) it&#x27;s 2007 data, it&#x27;s probably lower now (10 times lower?),(b) we definitely cover longer distances per hour of flying (by the way not that much, 60 mph vs 600 mph is within 10x difference),(c) it&#x27;s probably all flying, including private, but I&#x27;m not considering just public buses either.Add defensive driving though, and it&#x27;s not that obvious which is safer. reply secabeen 6 hours agorootparentThe report you seem to be citing is this one, which summarizes the data on General Aviation flights. Those are small private planes. Commercial air transport is not part of General Aviation.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aopa.org&#x2F;-&#x2F;media&#x2F;files&#x2F;aopa&#x2F;home&#x2F;training-and-sa...The last passenger death in a US Commercial Air Carrier was in 2019: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_fatal_accidents_and_in...Even assuming your 24-million flight hour number, that would mean 1 death over 100-million flight hours from 2020-2023. reply vc8f6vVV 6 hours agorootparentYep, I&#x27;m not actually claiming that driving is safer per se, but it&#x27;s apples vs oranges. I&#x27;m also not sure about 24M hours, total commercial airlines hours (i.e. aircraft hours, not passengers&#x27;) is around 14M&#x2F;year in 2018 (link in my other comment), so we need to multiply by the average number of passengers. Which gives >1B hours&#x2F;year for commercial airlines only.If that door had hit horizontal stabilizer though we would have had a completely different statistics even with 1B hours. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t happen, but with the current trend the idea that flying is always safer may become not so obvious, and \"orders of magnitude\" thing may disappear pretty fast. reply lovecg 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is roughly accurate for general aviation (people taking a Cessna out for a ride on a weekend, etc.) - it is about 10x deadlier than driving and the rates have been pretty stable for decades.If you look at just airlines, theyâre in turn 10x _safer_ than driving if I remember correctly. Thereâs this anecdote that after 9&#x2F;11 people were afraid to fly and died on the highways in much higher numbers. Thereâs also the fact that there there was a very small number of passenger deaths involving airliners in the US in over a decade (meaning no major crashes). Compared to thousands and thousands of traffic deaths a year that should drive the point home, even when you have to adjust for base rates. reply hunter2_ 7 hours agorootparentprevIMHO the comparison is to inform the decision point of whether to fly or drive somewhere, so the inputs should be limited accordingly: exclude drives that couldn&#x27;t reasonably be flown.Is it safer on average to do a long road trip, or fly? Historical crash data on long road trips (excluding commutes, local errands, etc.) probably doesn&#x27;t exist, but if it did, that would be very preferable. Perhaps people crash more when driving unfamiliar roads, with additional fatigue of long durations, with additional distraction of kids, etc. Or perhaps routine drives are worse because one lets their guard down! reply vc8f6vVV 6 hours agorootparentStatistics is a tricky thing. There are 43K traffic fatalities in the US per year and 53K deaths from colorectal cancer. Which means chances of dying from colorectal cancer is higher than dying in a traffic accident. Well, over a lifetime, but distribution over age can be different etc. In the same way 43K fatalities are not an even distribution over region, type of driving, destination, age etc.Of course I have to admit that flying commercial airlines is safer by average numbers, in the US and for now. But if we estimate total flying hours as 1.3B&#x2F;year (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;airlinedata&#x2F;www&#x2F;2018%2012%20Month%20Docum... times 100 passengers per aircraft) it only takes 1300 deaths per year to make it even with average traffic fatalities. If that flight had been unlucky enough to go down we would have had 177 deaths, already not \"orders of magnitude safer\" than driving. And the trend is not good.But again, we are comparing apples to oranges. Driving is a very different experience, both long and short trips. Nobody chooses to drive from Boston to LA just out of fear of flying (well, maybe there are exceptions, but \"nobody\" is still a very accurate word). As for short trips, changes of getting into an accident in urban area driving to the airport is probably higher than driving in the other direction towards your destination. Again, it depends. replymertd 13 hours agorootparentprevI only feel like I control slightly more than 50% of the situation with defensive driving. There&#x27;s very little you can do for example if someone decides to rear end you. reply I_Am_Nous 11 hours agorootparentEspecially since, most of the time, they weren&#x27;t intending to rear end you and therefore may be going far too fast to reasonably slow down in time. In my town of 1200 we had a death recently where a driver (no seatbelt) was speeding through a 45 MPH road and somehow didn&#x27;t see the loaded dump truck stopped to turn left at a construction site. Full speed contact, his vehicle veers to the right and into the ditch. He was either killed instantly or when he hit the ditch. reply shriek 13 hours agorootparentprevBecause the chance of you dying when something goes wrong in an aircraft at high altitude is significantly higher (almost 100%) than you dying in a car crash. There&#x27;s still a chance of you getting ambulance on road accidents but you&#x27;re plummeting to your death on major aircraft malfunction. reply mulmen 10 hours agorootparent> Because the chance of you dying when something goes wrong in an aircraft at high altitude is significantly higher (almost 100%) than you dying in a car crash.It isn&#x27;t though. Airliners have suffered in-flight engine explosions and decompressions multiple times since 2001 without fatalities. The last time a structural failure of an aircraft resulted in a crash was in 2000 and it was a design that entered service in 1959. Modern airliners don&#x27;t just fall out of the sky. They feature robust designs and highly competent crews.Cars regularly crash fatally without mechanical failures at all. And that says nothing of the dire state of car maintenance among the general population. reply mannykannot 5 hours agorootparent> The last time a structural failure of an aircraft resulted in a crash was in 2000 and it was a design that entered service in 1959.While I agree with your point, if the scope is scheduled airline flights in the USA, AA flight 587 crashed on 2001-11-12; globally, Egypt Air 804 on 2016-05-19. There have also been a few close calls, such as Qantas 32 on 2010-11-04, and collisions can also occur, such as that between BAL flight 2937 and DHL slight 611 on 2002-07-01, and Gol Transportes AÃ©reos flight 1907 with a business jet on 2006-09-29. And, given the topic is things going catastrophically wrong at altitude, there is AF447 on 2009-06-01. reply csours 9 hours agorootparentprevIt feels like this should be true, but your chance to survive a serious in-flight mishap are actually really good. Like a 90%+ chance of survival.How can that be? Very few serious in flight mishaps STAY in the news for more than one day, but proportionally MANY mishaps that lead to death stay in the news.This incident has juice because it&#x27;s a Boing 737 series aircraft.It may be hard to believe what I wrote here, and it would be hard to verify if you just look at the general news. You&#x27;ll need to look at specialized air transport reporting to see the baseline of major mishaps. reply Angostura 9 hours agorootparentprevHow many people died in todayâs incident? None. reply turquoisevar 3 hours agorootparentprevWhile I think itâs good to keep things in perspective and recognize that statistically youâre more likely to die on the ride to the airport than on the plane itself, it needs to be said that these statistics shouldnât lead to a complacent mindset especially because the redundancies in aviation can lead to such a mindset.Slowly but surely we see more cutting corners in aviation, especially in the US.This ranges from trying to evade certification for planes to crew hours, to more lax regulation on how air traffic is managed to increase movements at airports, to overworked and understaffed ATC.I donât think it has risen to levels that affect statistics in terms of death, but the statistics in terms of near catastrophic events has risen over the years. reply bcrosby95 10 hours agorootparentprevA death every 100 million miles driven in the US. That&#x27;s pretty safe. reply thfuran 10 hours agorootparentNot compared to flying. reply rootusrootus 9 hours agorootparentTrue, but it&#x27;s not an apples-to-apple comparison. If you compare by miles, then flying wins by a lot. If you compare by hour, it&#x27;s much closer (though I&#x27;m pretty sure flying still wins, yes). reply pi-e-sigma 9 hours agorootparentOnly commercial. If you add in General Aviation with some random poorly maintained Cessnas from the 70s piloted by some randoms in their 70s then it&#x27;s a completely different picture. reply mcmoor 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;ve heard that private aviation and private driving have comparable accident rate, which makes sense. Now I wonder how&#x27;s the rate of both public transportation. reply pi-e-sigma 9 hours agorootparentprevNot if you consider general aviation statistics and instead stick to the commercial planes only. And anyway these statistics are kinda massaged because they compare amount of miles travelled instead of comparing amount of time spend travelling. reply MadnessASAP 12 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t link you an independent source just my word as an aircraft mechanic.I have never seen a 100% serviceable aircraft, as far as I&#x27;m concerned a aircraft where everything works to spec and the spec works to needs is a myth that we strive for but can never achieve. reply Exuma 10 hours agorootparentGot any undercover advice for Airlines or plane models to avoid?

His team has 10 people. Two of them can write code for analytics and models. The other 8 \"manage projects\", whatever that means. They spend their days creating processes, managing tickets, enforcing specific formats of tickets and stories and what not. Yet, none of the eight knew how to write product specs nor could be bothered with basic things like understanding how git works.I have a hard time imagining how Boeing could survive in the long run with this level of bureaucracy.Edit: Saw the summary of the book Flying Blind: \"A fast-paced look at the corporate dysfunction--the ruthless cost-cutting, toxic workplaces, and cutthroat management--that contributed to one of the worst tragedies in modern aviation\". One has to ask: where did the cost cutting go? What&#x27;s cutting throat?

You could look at them and say that 2&#x2F;3 being non-technical was a problem, or you could look past that team to the several developers in India who weren&#x27;t exposed to the rest of the company or clients&#x2F;collaborators, and who actually got the work done. reply hintymad 9 hours agorootparentUnfortunately no.

Perhaps just to many formally cloistered academic PhDs are cashing in on the corporate rush to data and ML \"everything\", but have no actual ability to execute or even code.I went to a large \"AI\" conference this year and was surprised to see some talks being given by the \"VP of ML\" at the company I work at. I&#x27;d never heard of him or the position before, and when I looked him up in our company directory he appeared to sit somewhere in Pharmacy data science. But it&#x27;s a massive company, so who knows?When I attended his first talk wearing our company swag he seemed visibly uncomfortable and...grumpy(?) after he noticed me. His talk was a very non-technical, superficial fly-over of how ML can be used to profile and predict customer spending habits on our company e-commerce domains. Nothing even to do with pharma! At another table session in the day he dropped that his PhD is from MIT. Our company is big -name brand in its field- but by no means does it attract \"MIT level\" talent; not in pay, problems, or prestige. But again, it&#x27;s a massive company, so who know? Yet at this point I&#x27;m entertaining my own little conference conspiracy theory that this guy is just a corporate cutout.The next day I ran into him at the conference lunch line and gave him a: \"Hey, how&#x27;s it going! I&#x27;m at {our company} too, over in {line-of-business}\". He nodded, chuckled to himself, and without even looking up said \"oh yeah, you here to call me on my bullshit\"? I was so confused that this would be the first thing out of his mouth with no context between us, even as a seeming joke, that I didn&#x27;t know what to say. He politely excused himself to run to another table session before I could figure out how to respond.Since then I&#x27;ve tried to track his team and any work&#x2F;product&#x2F;output they might provide but for the life of me cannot find anything other than some Jira tickets that get pushed around.

Thereâs a drop between 1990 and 1991, a slight increase in 1992 (replenishment after Desert Storm?) and then a gradual decline in nominal dollars throughout the 1990âs. Also remember that federal budgets were usually passed ahead of time; this was before the government normalized all the government shutdowns and other monkeyshines we have grown accustomed to today, so budget changes might be a year behind current events. Adjusting for inflation the drop in spending would be even more.Spending does start to increase after 1998. Iâm not exactly sure why, but a lot of things started happening in 1998 and 1999, ranging from Bin Ladenâs attacks on American embassies, the Kosovo conflict, Saddam Hussein ejecting UN weapons inspectors from Iraq, the discovery of Chinese interference in the 1996 elections and China stealing nuclear secrets.Also, at the end of the Cold War, there were a number of systems that were in the late stages of design and development that were either radically cut back or canceled outright. These included the F-22, B-2, and Seawolf class submarine, just to name a few big ticket items. This saved a lot of money and made sense at the time since these were all designed specifically for Cold War missions that no longer seemed relevant. But eventually the older hardware still needs to be replaced; instead of replacing the Los Angeles class submarines with the Seawolf class starting in the 90âs, you end up replacing them with the Virginia class starting in the 00âs.Other cutbacks during the post-Cold War period included closing military bases (which was fraught with political difficulty; no congressman wants the base in his district to be closed!) and reducing the number of US forces permanently stationed in countries like Germany.Dollars arenât the only measure, either. One of Reaganâs goals was a 600 ship navy. It takes time to build ships so it wasnât until 1987 that the US Navy reached a peak size of 594 ships. Currently the US Navy has 238 ships. Sometimes a higher defense budget means youâre building a larger military but sometimes it means health care has gotten more expensive or you need to buy more fuel and ammunition to support operations.

Iâm not saying itâs evil on a conceptual level, but rather that a lot of companies start failing when they switch from thinking about what their users would like which happen to be ad supported as opposed to building products which are designed around ad revenue first. Itâs what gives you things like Google+ but also things like social media sites optimizing for outrage or other low-quality interactions which maximize ad sales revenue.YouTube has obviously done well, but look at everything theyâve done since the ad sales mentality dominated their thinking. Stuff like Google+ happens when you are thinking âwe need X to keep Facebook from cutting into our ad revenue, therefore our users will use Xâ rather than asking âwhat will our users like more than Facebook?â.The other side is what we saw with things like Stadia, GCP, or G-Suite where executives used to the ad model have trouble with other business models. The problem there again isnât that ads are evil but rather that you need to understand your users and what they want so you can think about the product the right way. reply nvm0n2 11 hours agorootparentprevNot a good example. Google reinterviewed every DoubleClick employee and fired half of them. reply acdha 11 hours agorootparentThat doesnât say anything about whether itâs a good example: even if itâs true, the real question would be whether they looked for the right things and especially who they kept at the management level â at the time, Google announced they were laying off a quarter of the employees due to redundancy, which tends to mean that groups like HR and accounting get hammered more than senior managers. This is especially important to get right when you consider that the most damaging people arenât comic book villains but rather people who sound like they know what theyâre talking about and are charismatic â exactly the sort of people who would make it through an interview process. reply bsimpson 14 hours agorootparentprevWho poisoned Netscape? reply classichasclass 12 hours agorootparentCollabra, per jwz.

From my limited understanding, I had this impression this was an engineering failure. And you know, when you have a complicated machine, sometimes shit happens.But it wasn&#x27;t that at all. Boeing knew clearly what the dangers of MCAS system were, they went to great lengths to completely hide the presence of the system from the world before delivery of the planes. Within days of the first crash, they knew it was MCAS, and kept trying to blame uneducated \"foreign\" pilots, kept trying to go on and tell the world again and again it was safe to fly, until that second crash happened. I understand greed, we all have that, but I don&#x27;t understand how a company-wide culture can get so toxic, how utterly devoid of humanity do you have to be that your first concern after that crash and knowing there might be more deaths coming, is keeping wall street happy.And what the hell FAA? 1) they didn&#x27;t regulate properly before the plane was delivered, 2) After first crash they knew how dangerous the plane is, but didn&#x27;t ground it (TAMARA report), 3) After second crash, you had the transportation secratary basically saying 737 Max was \"innocent untill proven guilty\" so let it fly before China forced its hand, 4) No criminal proescution in the end for those fanatic executives, just a cash fine.And today this happens. reply smcin 11 hours agorootparentYou have to view all US regulatory goings-on wrt Boeing through the lens of Airbus-Boeing&#x2F;EU-US trade rivalry (plus China&#x27;s COMAC as a new entrant).Boeing is the US&#x27;s largest exporter (defense + civilian), and also the 65th largest US stock overall. Any US regulator action against Boeing would affect all that, plus US stock markets. You have to wonder how independent the FAA head can afford to be from Congressional interference, in the current setup. In the US, the FAA head is appointed (or, in recent admins, left vacant) by the Senate.Back in the 2018&#x2F;9 first 737MAX scandal [0], it was the Canadian, EU and Chinese regulators which were more aggressive about investigating and grounding, meanwhile the US FAA dragged its feet on taking action against Boeing while its donees like Congressman Sam Graves (R-MO 6) [1] continued to blame foreign pilot training, which was dishonest and adding insult to injury.PS consider also in 2020, Rep. Mike Garcia (R-CA 27) secretly sold $50K Boeing stock ahead of his committee&#x27;s damning 737MAX report; then avoided election scrutiny by simply blowing the deadline to report the stock sale...

If you actually break apart Boeingâs merger history there were at least a half dozen WWII-era companies that slowly consolidated over half a century.Part of this was because WWII subsidized an unsustainable and frankly absurd level of demand. For instance, Grumman almost exclusively built carrier-based fighters, and by the end of WWII they were producing planes so quickly that the Navy stopped doing periodic heavy maintenance of their aircraft in lieu of dumping them into the sea and replacing them with brand new planes.

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT YOUR MONEY ADVISER I.R.S. to Begin Trial of Its Own Free Tax-Filing System Residents of 12 states are eligible to participate if they meet certain criteria. But the agencyâs plans have already met resistance from tax preparation companies. Share full article Credit... Thomas Fuchs By Ann Carrns Jan. 5, 2024 The Internal Revenue Service is rolling out a free option for filing federal tax returns this year to some residents of a dozen states. Last month, the agency published details of its plan to test an in-house filing system, in which taxpayers submit their federal tax returns directly to the agency online at no cost. Residents of 12 states are eligible to participate if they meet certain criteria. âThis is a critical step forward for this innovative effort that will test the feasibility of providing taxpayers a new option to file their returns for free directly with the I.R.S.,â Danny Werfel, the agencyâs commissioner, said in a recent statement. While the direct filing system is starting on a limited basis, it has already faced some resistance, particularly from commercial tax-preparation companies. A spokeswoman for Intuit, Tania Mercado, criticized the direct file project as a âhalf-baked solutionâ and a waste of taxpayer money. âThe direct file scheme is a solution in search of a problem,â she said. Intuit makes the TurboTax tax preparation software. Democrats in Congress generally support the idea of free, direct filing, while Republicans contend that the idea, part of President Bidenâs plan to overhaul the I.R.S., would give the agency even more power over ordinary taxpayers. The direct file pilot will be open to low- and moderate-income taxpayers with simple returns. To be eligible, for instance, filers must take the standard deduction and have income limited to wages reported on Form W-2, Social Security or unemployment as well as interest income of $1,500 or less. Gig workers arenât eligible. The I.R.S. said in November that it expected âat least several hundred thousand taxpayersâ to participate in what it called a âlimitedâ pilot. Many filers already have the option to prepare and submit free electronic returns based on their income, either through I.R.S. Free File, a partnership with do-it-yourself tax software firms, or directly through some commercial providers. The I.R.S. also provides online forms that any filers can use, regardless of income, to file returns at no cost. The I.R.S. Free File program, however, has had mixed results. The nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has reported, for instance, that Intuitâs TurboTax program steered users away from its free version. (Intuit no longer participates in I.R.S. Free File, although it offers its software free to certain users.) All those free options remain available, the I.R.S. said, and its test version will just be another option. But with the new direct file service, the I.R.S. aims to further streamline the filing process. In one possible scenario included in the agencyâs report to Congress, the I.R.S. could fill out tax returns with information it already has, like data from W-2 wage statements. For the pilot, however, participants will have to enter their own financial information, the I.R.S. said. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ordered the I.R.S. to study direct filing. In May, the agency submitted a report to Congress that found a majority of taxpayers would be interested in using a direct-file tool, and it began preparing for a pilot test. In the report, the I.R.S. estimated that the annual cost of a direct-file system could range from $64 million to $249 million, depending on the scope of the service. (A separate report from the Treasury Departmentâs inspector general for tax administration, however, said that the design of the surveys conducted in the earlier report might have âoverstatedâ taxpayer interest and that the department couldnât determine the âreasonablenessâ of the agencyâs cost estimates.) The pilot system was built at the I.R.S. by a team of tax experts, product managers, software engineers, designers and data scientists, according to the agency. The I.R.S. said it was collaborating with special teams within the government that help agencies develop digital services. The I.R.S. says direct file will walk users through the steps of preparing a return, as commercial software does. The service will be âmobile friendly,â and available in English and Spanish. Users can get help from the agency via a live online chat function and will have the option to speak with a customer service representative on the phone if needed. In online summaries, the agency has said that to make sure the pilot works well, it will initially be opened to âa small group of taxpayersâ during the 2024 filing season. As the season progresses, âmore and moreâ eligible taxpayers will be able to use the service. âWeâre starting small to get it right,â the agency said in an update. The I.R.S. said it would promote the filing option in part through its network of grass-roots and community partners, like the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, which provides free tax help for low- and moderate-income filers and for people with disabilities. The agency said it planned to issue a public report on the pilot before deciding if the direct filing system should be opened to more tax payers. Here are some questions and answers about the upcoming tax filing season: What states are included in the pilot? Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State and Wyoming are participating. Most of those states donât tax income at the state level, but the four that do â Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York â will guide participants to a state-supported tool that they can use to submit their state returns. âItâs exciting this is happening,â said Gabriel Zucker, associate policy director for tax benefits at Code for America, a nonprofit organization that builds digital tools to help taxpayers get access to government services. The group is building state electronic filing software for Arizona and New York that participants in the I.R.S. pilot can use to file their state returns. âWe do expect it can take the headache out of filing,â Mr. Zucker said. According to an announcement from Gov. Kathy Hochulâs office, direct file users in New York will be able to share the information on their federal returns with Code for Americaâs filing tool. The tool will prepare most of the state return using the data provided, and most taxpayers will have to answer no more than a few simple questions to complete their New York return. How soon can I file my income taxes this year? The I.R.S. hasnât announced a start date for filing returns for tax year 2023, but itâs typically in late January. (Last year, filing season opened on Jan. 23.) When is the tax filing deadline this year? The federal filing deadline for tax year 2023 returns is April 15, for most filers. State filing deadlines may vary. A version of this article appears in print on , Section B, Page 4 of the New York edition with the headline: I.R.S. to Begin Trial of Free Tax-Filing System.

But taxes aren&#x27;t business - it&#x27;s a governmental function, and there&#x27;s no reason why the government who levies the taxes can&#x27;t also produce proper documentation for it and make the compliance easier. There could be corner cases where it&#x27;s hard to do, fine - just do the easy 80% and let the business take care of the rest. Let the business also be able to check it and profit if they find a mistake. If you don&#x27;t believe The Man did it right - you should be able to download the data and give it to the same Intuit folks and see if they can do better. It&#x27;s just adding an easy option, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with that at all.Intuit would do fine with it - yes, they&#x27;d lose some income, but they have more then enough other business, both in more complex taxes and other ways of organizing business, they don&#x27;t need to be able to fleece every single taxpayer. In fact, if such IRS system is built, they&#x27;d probably will make a good buck by providing added value offerings to it, just as they do now for existing tax filing systems.Even if the system to do that costs double to the high estimate - let&#x27;s say $0.5B per year, given the government projects are always over cost - it&#x27;s still about 0.15% of the taxes collected every year. There&#x27;s no reason why it&#x27;d have any influence at all on the level of taxes collected. reply remarkEon 6 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really a distraction.It seems illogical for the government to not have a free, easy way for the taxpayer to remit their taxes to the government (or submit the paperwork that should generate a return from that government). But at the same time I think it&#x27;s fine to be skeptical that you should trust the government to be honest in showing you what amount of taxes you actually owe given how complicated the tax code is, and because there exists, ahem, a bit of an incentive problem there.Is the free-filing system designed to maximize your return? Is it designed for ease of use? Generally I agree that TurboTax is a leech, but just because they&#x27;re leeches doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t an incentive problem that should be addressed.>Then, truly public-minded services can use the receipt to help people understand if their filings were correct.Do you mean a private company does this? Or something else? reply MobiusHorizons 5 hours agorootparentDo you consider it an incentive problem for cloud providers to send you a bill instead of asking you to submit what you believe you should owe? We have societally solved these problems my making them auditable. People donât necessarily trust the bill, and have means of disputing it. If you think the governmentâs tool is overcharging, you are welcome to file your own taxes and deal with the possibility of getting audited. reply remarkEon 3 hours agorootparentWait, do people not keep track of their own usage to compare it to their AWS bill? I just use free tiers for personal projects, but I guess I assumed that there would be some log reviews at some point if you were using it for running an actual business.Anyway, I guess that means my answer is \"yes\".>If you think the governmentâs tool is overcharging, you are welcome to file your own taxes and deal with the possibility of getting audited.\"Pay what we say you owe or we&#x27;ll nuke your finances with an audit\". Yes this is exactly my problem. reply turquoisevar 3 hours agorootparent> \"Pay what we say you owe or we&#x27;ll nuke your finances with an audit\". Yes this is exactly my problem.You might be misunderstanding in what an audit entails.Thereâs no direct ânukingâ of finances due to an audit.In the vast majority of cases an audit is nothing more than âyou claimed this on your return, can you please provide the documentation that supports it?âMore specifically, I believe most audits are about claiming child tax credit and them wanting documentation to support the claim.If your finances get nuked that means you lied on your return, with very few exceptions.Main exception that comes to mind is claiming expenses that are up for debate.Also circling back to your earlier comment. Yes the tax code is needlessly complicated, Intuit et al. are the ones who caused that and are actively lobbying against simplifying it because their paid services would become obsolete if the tax code was nice and simple. reply AnthonyMouse 6 hours agorootparentprev> Is the free-filing system designed to maximize your return?The solution to this is for the government to publish the source code in the public domain. Then anyone who can do better can fork it and sell it, which will make that market more competitive when it&#x27;s cheaper to enter because the government has already done 80% of the work, but there will only be a market for this if the government isn&#x27;t maximizing your return. \"Better return than the free system or your money back\" would be a great way to get customers, and they&#x27;d be viable with fewer customers when they&#x27;re only paying the incremental cost of doing what the government failed to.And then the government system would be embarrassed if private forks could frequently beat them, which improves their incentives. reply iambateman 5 hours agorootparentOh, nice, this is a fun idea. If submitting taxes were essentially an open API endpoint and the front end was an open source government-sponsored UX. Love that.The US Digital Corps has the technical chops to do that well if the politics could work out.To the Intuit folks reading this because your boss told you to keep an eye on the sentiment on Hacker Newsâ¦donât worry you can _totally_ have your own fork and since youâre the best you would have nothing to worry about. Since you care so much about the American tax payer, I look forward to your enthusiastic support of more transparent tax filing. reply smsm42 3 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t need the code even - though the code, as being already paid for by the taxpayers, should be available to them anyway - the rules are public, the data should be available to the public, so you can just reimplement the rules and see if you get the same answer. They key here to make the data a) available b) portable c) every decision the system takes be documented and having the audit trail. reply AnthonyMouse 2 minutes agorootparentYou do need the code because if the public system gets it right for 90% of the taxpayers, a private system for the remaining taxpayers would have to cover its costs with only 10% of the revenue. Releasing the code reduces their costs because they don&#x27;t have to duplicate the parts the government already got right, they only have to fix what it got wrong.\"The rules\" in this case is the tax code, which is written in lawyer. You can imagine how converting that into computer code is a non-trivial undertaking notwithstanding that it&#x27;s public information. roddds 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sorry if this is stupid - I&#x27;m not American and this is entire conversation about taxes here is nuts, but:>Is the free-filing system designed to maximize your return?Why does it need to? I mean, why do you need a tax return, if your taxes would be lower if you just got charged the right amount in the first place? And then isn&#x27;t the role of society to audit their own taxes, and at the same time support candidates that vow to simplify the tax code? reply remarkEon 3 hours agorootparentTo simplify what is an absurdly complicated topic, the US Tax Code gives you a lot of \"breaks\" for certain things. For a lot of those things, the government won&#x27;t know they happened unless you tell them (and you prove it). In most cases (i.e. for regular salaried or hourly employees) your taxes are automatically deducted, and then at the beginning of the new year you basically give the government a list of things that happened that could&#x2F;would&#x2F;should reduce your taxable income, which results in you getting money back from the government (sometimes). reply geodel 4 hours agorootparentprevWell this is indeed stupid.> if you just got charged the right amount in the first place?right amount is loaded phrase. There is big range and disagreement over what is right amount.> And then isn&#x27;t the role of society ... to simplify the tax code?It is about as intelligent as saying isn&#x27;t it role of society that ensure we all live peacefully, then we don&#x27;t need armies, defense budgets and so on. reply iambateman 4 hours agorootparentprevSkepticism is welcome on all things government.But most of the time our government does sketchy things away from the attention and affliction of the selectorate.If millions of influential people were using a system, the IRS would have an extremely strong incentive to avoid negative PR through chicanery.And we already have an incentive problem in the current setup, anyway. reply rayiner 5 hours agoparentprevThe IRS already provides a transcript. reply iambateman 5 hours agorootparentNice, I didnât realize that.I just checked and it looks like a good start, even though Iâd like it to be fully granular. reply _ihaque 13 hours agoprevFor anyone interested in why the system looks the way it does, I recommend patio11&#x27;s insightful recent blog post, which is nominally about payroll systems but ends up discussing the history of taxation in the US because that&#x27;s the origination of many of these systems: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsaboutmoney.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;payroll-providers-pow...A relevant quotation for much of the discussion here:> And, relevant to the question of whether Intuit controls U.S. tax policy: it canât, because that would imply they have wrested control from Norquist. Norquist considers a public filing option a tax increase by stealth and opposes it automatically. reply neilkk 10 hours agoparentpatio11 has a huge and well known bias here, which is that he wants to claim, not necessarily with evidence, that all inefficiency is caused by governments and not by the private sector.A comparison of tax filing in the United States with other countries, including those where governments are much bigger and more interventionist, leads to a different conclusion. reply mixdup 8 hours agorootparent>that all inefficiency is caused by governmentsForget about the evidence of other countries (which is completely valid), I just hate the argument that government inherently because it&#x27;s government is inefficient and will never be effectiveIn the US half the people in charge of the government hate it and want it to fail. Of course it&#x27;s going to be bloated, inefficient, and costly. It&#x27;s being sabotaged from the top. If everyone agreed that, once we make a choice on what the government is going to do we should do it well, we could have government services that are just as effective as whatever private enterprise example people always like to cite (being from the South it&#x27;s usually the Chick Fil A drive-thru) reply moduspol 7 hours agorootparentAnd that&#x27;s why our west coast cities, which are not run by the half that hates government, are shining beacons of just how effective and successful governments can be. reply ksenzee 6 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s this idea that west coast cities are shitholes, and honestly it&#x27;s BS. I live in the Seattle suburbs and I&#x27;m downtown regularly, and the only obvious problem is the public disorder visited on us all by Martin v. Boise. It&#x27;s pretty clear from housing prices that wealthy people are still happy living in Seattle: the market is speaking loudly. Don&#x27;t get me wrongâI live in the suburbs for a reason, you couldn&#x27;t pay me enough to live in Seattleâbut as cities go, it&#x27;s fine. Republicans who hate big disorderly cities like I do should just enjoy their suburban parking lots and breathing room, and quit pretending city chaos equals Democratic mismanagement. reply rayiner 4 hours agorootparentThat doesnât really respond to the point, though. Is Seattleâs government efficient and effective? To my recollection, Seattle doesnât have great public services. reply ksenzee 4 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t look to me (from 20 miles away) as if Seattle&#x27;s government is notably efficient or effective, and I&#x27;d even say one-party rule is partly to blame: opposition parties serve a useful purpose. But I don&#x27;t think the standard Republican sneer of \"look what a crappy job the Democrats do of running the big cities\" makes any sense, either. The things Republicans are pointing at as symptoms of bad Democratic government are mostly just side effects of what people in American cities like. reply rayiner 3 hours agorootparentThey like crappy public transit, trigger-happy cops, and shitty schools? reply ksenzee 2 hours agorootparentThis is where it gets subjective again and I bow out, because the Seattleites I know would disagree with you (except about the cops, which is the same problem nationwide). reply int_19h 5 hours agorootparentprevI agree that in many cases there isn&#x27;t any substance behind the talk. Yet the single largest state-to-state flow of people is from California to Texas, not the other way around; surely there&#x27;s something objective that is driving that. And, given the time and effort required for such a move, it&#x27;s not something most people would do on a whim without doing at least some research. reply ksenzee 4 hours agorootparentHm. We have plenty of Washington-to-Texas migration from the suburbs, and there&#x27;s no serious contention that, say, Auburn and Kent are mismanaged by Democrats. I know multiple families who have left for Texas in the last few years, and it wasn&#x27;t \"this place has crap government,\" it was \"this place is woke.\" That is, they wanted more \"traditional values\" in their kids&#x27; schools and fewer BLM and pride flags. To me that&#x27;s a valid and objective reason to leave (and honestly they&#x27;re welcome to go, I don&#x27;t want them running for school board even if we are friends) but it doesn&#x27;t support the contention that government here is incompetent. It just means government here is socially liberal, which it unquestionably is. reply int_19h 31 minutes agorootparentThere are certainly people leaving for these reasons. Yet polls also show that there are also plenty of left-leaning folk who move. reply rayiner 4 hours agorootparentprevAn even better comparison in California to California. The year Apple IPOed, Reagan handily won California. Santa Clara County only voted a democrat for President twice between 1948 and 1987âLBJ (who won 20 points nationwide), and weirdly enough Hubert Humphrey. In the founding and golden ages of Silicon Valley, it was a red suburb in a red state. It was like what Florida is now. reply int_19h 26 minutes agorootparentYeah, no. GOP today has very little semblance to GOP of Reagan times (although the seeds of the present insanity have been sown then, and even earlier - Trumpism is a perfectly logical end result of Birchers, \"moral majority\" etc).

It is an argument about relative ROI, not absolute quality of life. If I spend $150k on a car, I donât expect a used Toyota Corolla.Cities like Seattle generate inexplicably little public value for the extremely high per capita spending. It should be much nicer for the amount of money it spends. The quality of services relative to expenditure is not defensible. Many cities do far more with far less. Iâve lived in Seattle around downtown for a long time, but it is far from the only city I spend time in. If per capita spending was correlated with quality of city experience, Seattle should be one of the best cities in the world to live in, but I donât think anyone would make the argument that this is the case. As with San Francisco, most of that taxpayer money is lit on fire with no accountability and no contribution to the public good.This is similar to the observation that on the same stretch of highway, California somehow manages to spend 10x per mile as its neighbors for visibly and audibly worse roads. People have made jokes about it for decades because the contrast is so stark if you drive on those roads.It is not unreasonable for taxpayers to expect better than what is available in other cities when they are spending several-fold what those other cities are to achieve, at best, the same results. It doesnât have to be a total shithole to be grossly mismanaged. People in Seattle spend enough tax money per capita that their city experience is far worse than what they have a right to expect.It isnât a political issue. reply ksenzee 2 hours agorootparentI agree with almost everything here, but this isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m referring to.

It&#x27;s perfectly possible for a market with 10 or 20 competitors to stop competing for mutual benefit.

If I don&#x27;t owe anything, I shouldn&#x27;t even need to file anything. If I do owe taxes, send me the forms prefilled and let me either sign off on them or add any missing info as needed.

However, if you approach it from a more systemic analytical point of view you have to take into account that surrounding the &#x27;small&#x27; efficient business, there are dozens if not hundreds of unsuccessful competing small entities vying for the same niche.

If most people are the same every year, then a small increase from one year to the next barely gets noticed because people are going to be looking for changes to their records, not changes on the bottom line, so the fact that the bottom line is 0.5% more this year will be more likely missed in the face of answering \"are the records the IRS claims they have about me the right ones\".The other is related to the concept of \"price anchoring\". Approving pre-filled numbers becomes more about validating that your information is correct, rather than determining (and looking at) the tax value for the year.

Often, they donât know how much you owe in this case. reply plasmatix 5 hours agorootparentprevFunny enough, a few years ago I got a ~$20 check from the IRS after they made some adjustments to my tax filing.So not only can they do it for you, they can do it better! reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparentprev> Reckon it&#x27;s since people also over pay, and there&#x27;s no refunds for doing that.Sure there are.

We just got a nasty tax bill from the IRS because when my wife gets an RSU grant, her company sells some stock to pay income tax for that grant. Little did I know, that generates a 1040 for the stock sale (to pay ordinary income taxes) with a cost basis of zero! Instead, you have to adjust the cost basis to the entire sale (or even more!) via supplemental information. Annoying, so I had to learn a bunch of tax rules over one day on the weekend, and in the end the amended return said the IRS owed us money.Itâs crazy stuff like this that means the IRS canât really calculate your taxes for you. reply georgeecollins 11 hours agorootparentTrue, but 99.5% of Americans don&#x27;t get RSUs.

But her company grants RSUs and sells stock to cover income tax, mine gives less stock and grants cash to cover taxes instead. Which is why I was surprised she was getting 1040s at all. But the stock is sold to cover tax, since a stock grant is taxed as ordinary income, that this generates a 1040 with a cost basis of zero is crazy. replyghaff 12 hours agorootparentprevNot at all clear the IRS wonât refund overpayments.

The $80B was not earmarked for hiring agents; that was an additional $80B for the entire agency spread over 10 years. While some of that money might be used to hire additional agents, it will also be used to upgrade old technology (the IRS still uses software from the 1950s), make fixed capital investments that have been long-deferred, regulate third-party tax preparers, provide better customer service, crack down on tax evasion and improve enforcement.Additionally, this funding needs to be set in the context of an agency whose budget has shrank 20% over the last decade and whose staffing is set to further shrink through attrition and retirements. The IRS Commissioner testified that the IRS would have to hire 52,000 employees over the next 10 years just to keep staffing at current levels [1].Finally, the Treasury has argued that this $80B investment would (conservatively) lead to an additional $700B in tax revenue over the next decade, so this spending ends up being entirely revenue-positive [2].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;written-testimony-of-charles-p-...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;136&#x2F;The-American-Fami...Edit: since this is Hacker News, I thought it worth pointing out that most of the IRS&#x27; software is written in COBOL.

Sometimes it took a couple of months. The US form I think was pretty prompt occasionally.Now we&#x27;re also not talking a lot of money. +- a couple of thousand, usually less. But you would have to compare apples to apples which would be the e-file fee vs. the compounded inflation rate for the time difference in receiving, presumably, your refund. I suspect it&#x27;s a wash.You need to also factor in the ${turbotax} fee and&#x2F;or the accountant, as well, if you don&#x27;t actually fill out the forms yourself.Fun fact: We moved from AZ to GA last year, and dutifully filed in each state. I am pretty familiar with AZ due to filing our own taxes for most of 25 years, but GA is much more complex, verbose, and quite stupidly, even aggressively, vague.I produced a spreadsheet for my wife to evaluate that presented my first time interpretation of the GA partial residency filing. We&#x27;re both B.S. ChE, she&#x27;s an MS ChE, I&#x27;m a MS App. Math. So we know our numbers. The tables were low risk, low refund, medium risk, medium refund, high risk, high refund.

Like even with 100KB of data stored per user, which seems like way more than necessary, that&#x27;s only 2.5 TB. So storage isn&#x27;t the issue. And if everyone did their returns in the last possible hour and did 100 requests&#x2F;return, that&#x27;s ~700k requests&#x2F;second. In actuality the load should be far lower; maybe it&#x27;d peak in the thousands. I&#x27;m not seeing why there would be any variable technology cost at that level, much less $7M.Putting some concrete numbers on the infrastructure, for $500k you could have like 10 servers each with 60 cores and 32 TB of mirrored NVMe storage. Any one server could handle the load while being almost completely idle (i.e. you&#x27;re really just buying extreme redundancy).

On the back are instructions for where it goes on the forms.The basics are simple, but few people really understand taxes at all let alone care to look at the forms. Instead probably 70% of people go to an accountant and give them the forms to punch into a program which generates the IRS forms and e-files them. Cheap places are maybe $100, but complicated returns at good accountants run like $500.The other option most people who \"do their own taxes\" do is to purchase a yearly license to software which you can punch the numbers into yourself and it&#x27;ll generate and e-file a return for you. It&#x27;s like $50â$70 normally but some are free.Most complications arise either from:* You run your own business and have to do two returns basically without getting nice filled forms for all the numbers. * Congress constantly wants to incentivize behaviors and give people breaks on their taxes so there are a lot of little things you can get credits for like having kids and buying electric vehicles.

Itâs really hard to intuit the strategy being employed so best to just ignore them altogether.

Sounds gross! Ewwwww! Well actually I&#x27;ve been debugging c++ templates since forever and hohum it doesn&#x27;t bother me. However... every single time it decoded the problem and told me exactly what I needed to do. It has taken me 2-4 tries each year to get it debugged and then it sails right through. The final result I&#x27;ve fed into two different state forms and that has sailed right through too. All free, and not that much of my time.Now if they can get the UI for normies painless, which I suspect is the main programming problem (I don&#x27;t say that UI programming is trivial), this will take off like a rocket ship and the US can the join the coterie of civilized nations that do this for all their citizens. reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re referring to Free Fillable Forms, the error messages are not DB errors, but \"business logic rules errors\". They do look like gibberish, but buried inside them is a code that can generally give a pretty clue as to the error.I agree that it would be much nicer if they said \"The amount of line 29 of Form ABCD does not appear at line 18 of Form WXYZ\".Even nicer if you never had to manually transfer amounts between forms. reply downut 11 hours agorootparentOh yes I am sorry; I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that I thought that the DB was throwing an error. What the filing process email message body stated looked something like approximately \"Form line xxx violates schema requirement such and such: \".I was thinking when I scanned the message was that I bet I could reverse engineer the problem from this back end generated text but why not do what the instructions say and just feed it into the parser box? And every time the next email message gave me exactly the thing I needed to do. It was cool, for a weird sort of nerd.So no, I was casting shade where the process was right in the sunlight: I made the mistake, and the business logic caught it, and told me correctly every time what I needed to do to fix it.

Offering a more accessible free version to file taxes is great, but the real problem is the need to file taxes at all for a lot of people.

Don&#x27;t even need to itemize in a lot of cases, since the standard deduction is preferable in many years.Unless you&#x27;re dealing with foreign income, are a business, or do a lot of contract work for cash, I don&#x27;t see much reason why the IRS can&#x27;t just handle all the taxes automatically - apart from the fact that some company wants to charge me $150 a year to file my taxes and making sure that my tax situation (which would fit on a beer coaster otherwise) is as complicated as possible. reply usaar333 14 hours agorootparent> Unless you&#x27;re dealing with foreign income, are a business, or do a lot of contract work for cash, I don&#x27;t see much reason why the IRS can&#x27;t just handle all the taxes automatically - apart from the fact that some company wants to charge me $150 a year to file my taxes and making sure that my tax situation (which would fit on a beer coaster otherwise) is as complicated as possible.I imagine there are heavy software development costs, on par with what it might take to build Turbotax itself.For instance, someone is going to have to figure out wash sales. Right now your broker does it, but you can wash sale across accounts, which requires you (or more reasonably tax software) to both detect this and track the adjusted basis in perpetuity. More complex events, like straddles, further exist, and even consumer-grade tax software won&#x27;t handle it correctly.Even implementing the tax code correctly for regular income is difficult.

I&#x27;m so tired of every time someone suggests automatic tax filling, there is always one guy bring up some tax term that 99.99% people never heard of. Sure, if auto tax filling doesn&#x27;t solve your wash sale calculation, feel free to go back to TurboTax.

    "title": "Exploring In-Browser Code Playground: Codapi and the Power of Lightweight WASI Runtime",
    "originLink": "https://antonz.org/in-browser-code-playgrounds/",
    "originBody": "In-browser code playgrounds I'm a big fan of interactive code snippets in all kinds of technical writing, from product docs to online courses to blog posts. Like this one: def greet(name): print(f\"Hello, {name}!\") greet(\"World\") Run Edit In fact, I even built an open source tool called Codapi1 for embedding such snippets. Typically, a code playground consists of a client-side widget and a server-side part that executes the code and returns the result: browser âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ â def greet(name): â â print(f\"Hello, {name}!\") â â â â greet(\"World\") â âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ Run âº â server âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ â docker run codapi/python â â python main.py â âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ â browser âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ â Hello, World! â âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ Personally, I'm quite happy with this setup. But often people prefer not to depend on a server and run the code entirely in the browser. So I decided to look into it and implemented embeddable in-browser code playgrounds for JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Lua, and SQLite. Running language runtimes in the browser The modern way to run arbitrary programs in the browser seems to be WebAssembly System Interface (WASI2) â an executable binary format based on WebAssembly. With WASI, you compile a program (originally written in C, Rust, Go, or some other language) into a WASI binary and then run it with a WASI runtime (there are a number of these runtimes from different vendors). Just as we can compile an arbitrary program into WASI binary, we can take a language interpreter like Lua or CPython, compile it into WASI, and run it with the WASI runtime to execute Lua or Python code. In practice, however, it's not that easy, because WASI compilers do not (yet) implement all the features of traditional compilers like GCC. Fortunately, VMWare Labs has already done the hard part and compiled PHP3, Python4 and Ruby5 into WASI. So all I had to do was publish the WASI binaries as NPM packages to make them available on the CDN. I've also compiled Lua6 and SQLite7 to WASI. There is also Kohei Tokunaga's container2wasm initiative8, which converts arbitrary Docker images into WASI binaries. It looks promising, but it generates 100+ MB binaries for even the smallest Alpine-based images. And since downloading hundreds of megabytes just to read an interactive article is probably not the best idea, this approach is not very practical (yet). Language runtimes compiled into WASI are one part of the equation. The other one is the WASI runtime (the thing that runs the binaries) capable of working in the browser. I chose the Runno9 runtime by Ben Taylor because it's simple and lightweight (27 KB). The last step was to modify the JavaScript widget10 to support pluggable engines (WASI is one of them). And that was it! Showcase Here are some interactive code snippets implemented as described above. Note that the language runtime is downloaded when you click the Run button, so the first run may take some time. Subsequent runs are almost instantaneous. Python Executes the code using the Python 3.12 WASI runtime (26.3 MB). def greet(name): print(f\"Hello, {name}!\") greet(\"World\") Run Edit PHP Executes the code using the PHP 8.2 WASI runtime (13.2 MB). function greet($name) { echo \"Hello, $name!\"; } greet(\"World\"); Run Edit Ruby Executes the code using the Ruby 3.2 WASI runtime (24.5 MB). def greet(name) puts \"Hello, #{name}!\" end greet(\"World\") Run Edit Lua Executes the code using the Lua 5.4 WASI runtime (330 KB). function greet(name) print(\"Hello, \" .. name .. \"!\") end greet(\"World\") Run Edit JavaScript Executes the code using the AsyncFunction11. const greet = (name) => { console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); }; greet(\"World\"); Run Edit Fetch Executes the code using the Fetch API12. POST https://httpbingo.org/dump/request content-type: application/json { \"message\": \"hello\" } Run Edit SQLite Executes the code using the SQLite 3.44 WASI runtime (2.1 MB). select id, name, department from employees order by id limit 3; Run Edit Advanced features Because the WASI runtime plugs into the existing architecture, WASI-powered code snippets support advanced Codapi features such as templates or code cells. Templates13 allow you to hide some code behind the scenes and show only the relevant part. For example, in the SQLite example above, the employees table is created as part of the template, so the snippet can take it for granted: select id, name, department from employees order by id limit 3; Run Edit Code cells14 allow you to make code snippets depend on each other. For example, the first snippet defines the wrap function, while the second snippet uses it: import textwrap def wrap(text, width=20): \"\"\"Wraps the text so every line is at most width characters long.\"\"\" return textwrap.fill(text, width) Run Edit text = ( \"Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly \" \"and integrate systems more effectively.\" ) print(wrap(text)) Run Edit Usage To use native browser playgrounds (e.g. JavaScript or Fetch), include the snippet.js script and add the codapi-snippet element next to the static code example. Use the browser engine: console.log(\"hello\")To use WASI-powered playgrounds (e.g. Python or SQLite), include two additional scripts and use the wasi engine: print(\"hello\") To switch from in-browser to server-side playgrounds (which can run virtually any software), remove the engine attribute:fn main() { println!(\"Hello, World!\"); } See the documentation15 for details. Summary WASI-powered sandboxes allow code snippets to run completely in-browser, with no server involved. They may take some time and traffic to initialize the runtime, but after that they run almost instantly. As implemented in Codapi, they fit nicely into the overall architecture, providing access to features like templates and code cells. You can also easily switch from a browser-side to a server-side execution model. Give them a try!

It has a REPL and a code editor that saves files in the browser local storage. It also has a tutorial for learning the basics of Scheme.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeboot.org is a playground for Python (there&#x27;s an old version that supports JavaScript and we may resurrect it at some point). It was specifically designed as a simple IDE to teach programming to beginners and is in use at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. Aside from the simple and intuitive UI, it has two important features for teaching:1) Fine granularity single-stepping of Python code to help teach students how the computer goes about executing the code. It displays a bubble containing the variables in scope and their values.2) It can bundle programs and the current state of execution in a URL that can be embedded in documents (HTML, PDF, PowerPoint, Keynote, etc) so that coding examples can be executed by the students in a single click. It also allows students to create simple web apps that require no installation and can easily be shared with others (because the URL contains all the relevant code of the app). You will find examples of this feature on the following pages:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeboot-org.github.io&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeboot-org.github.io&#x2F;cegep&#x2F; (in french, but just click on the images) reply theanonymousone 18 hours agoprevI have played a bit with Pyodide and it is very promising for client-side web programming, particularly because of the philosophy similarities between Python and JavaScript, which make interaction more seamless.Being interpreted is a hindrance, though: The interpreter itself is at least a few megabytes in size, constraining wider usability (IMO).I&#x27;m enthusiastically waiting for solutions to \"compile\" Python code to WASM, instead of running it with a WASM-compiled interpreter.

Thanks! reply dmsnell 15 hours agoparentprevMy teammate built the WordPress Playgroundhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;playground.wordpress.netThe motivation was initially to build interactive documentation where you could play with the code examples and see how they change things, but it&#x27;s being used to demonstrate plugins on the WordPress directory, build staging sites, add no-risk places to experiment.Surprisingly has been taking over some of the native development tools because it provides a sandboxed and isolated environment that needs no other dependencies and leaves no junk on your computer once it&#x27;s done. It&#x27;s trivial to change the PHP version being run (making testing on different version of PHP easy) by adding `--php 5.6`, for example, which is something a bit gnarly to do otherwise unless running PHP inside Docker.Another surprise is that once loaded, it runs very fast, faster than native PHP and MySQL (the Playground can connect to MySQL but runs sqlite by default). I attribute this to having everything in memory and bypassing the filesystem.It&#x27;s been the kind of project that only gets better the more it&#x27;s used. It turns out that having a no-setup, no-trace, isolated, risk-free app playground is an incredible tool for more purposes than we first realize. Someone even put the Playground inside an iOS app and it runs smoother than the native WordPress app.As for a good solution? Just a lot of work I guess but WASM is critical to it.

    "originBody": "Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel Earth Video Live FAA grounds 171 Boeing planes after mid-air blowout on Alaska Airlines jet By George Wright BBC News Watch: 'Trip from hell': On board flight during mid-air blow out The US airline regulator has ordered the grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after part of one plane fell off during an Alaska Airlines flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the inspections would affect 171 planes. On Friday the Alaska Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing after take-off from the US state of Oregon. United Airlines says it has carried out the inspections required by the FAA on some of its 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. Removing some of the aircraft from service was expected to cause about 60 cancellations on Saturday, the airline said in a statement. Earlier, the FAA said it would \"order the temporary grounding of certain Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft operated by US airlines or in US territory\". Required inspections would take around four to eight hours per aircraft, it said. Turkish Airlines has also recalled its five planes of that model for checks. In Friday's incident, the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. The airline, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is investigating the incident, confirmed on Saturday that nobody had been sitting next to the affected section. \"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,\" Jennifer Homendy said. She added that investigators believed the door that came off the plane was now in the Cedar Hills neighbourhood in Portland and urged anyone who found it to contact local police. Meanwhile, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) confirmed that there were no UK-registered 737 Max 9 aircraft. \"We have written to non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask inspections have been undertaken prior to operation in UK airspace,\" it wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Images sent to news outlets of the affected area showed the night sky visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. There were no immediate indications of the cause of the apparent structural failure, nor any reports of injuries. Passenger Evan Smith said: \"There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped. \"They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.\" Listen: Alaska flight's distress call to air traffic control In an audio clip, the pilot can be heard talking to air traffic control requesting a diversion. \"We are an emergency,\" she said. \"We are depressurised, we do need to return back.\" According to photographs, the affected area was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing and engines. The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators, but not by Alaska. Terry Tozer, a former airline pilot who has written extensively on aviation safety, said the section should have been bolted into place if it was not being used as an emergency exit. He told the BBC News Channel that the passengers would not have been able to tell the area was not a normal window from inside the cabin. While the loss of this section would probably not have affected how the aircraft flew, Mr Tozer added, there would have been a \"huge risk\" to anyone sitting nearby. Announcing the initial grounding of 65 planes, Alaska Airlines' CEO Ben Minicucci said: \"Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.\" A later statement said that more than a quarter of those planes had been inspected and would return to service as there were no issues found. In a statement, Boeing said it supported the FAA's decision. and was co-operating with the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation of the Alaska Airlines incident. \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,\" Boeing said. It is the latest problem involving Boeing's best-selling model, which was grounded for almost two years following crashes in 2018 and 2019.

But in this case the employee in question, again not employed by Carta but a separate business, Carta Marketplace, was able to access our cap table data by their âbreak the glassâ system which requires approval to see customer data.

In what sorts of situations would it be beneficial to Carta&#x27;a clients for another company (Carta Marketplace) to access their confidential information? reply mattzito 6 hours agorootparentMy guess is that itâs a customer support system that has a mode where non-support agents like account managers can in emergencies access a companies carta account. Imagine a scenario where a founder is freaking out because it seems like the cap table in carta doesnât match the spreadsheet theyâve been working on, and theyâre in the middle of negotiating a funding. They might call their account manager in a panic asking for their help, and the AM might want to see their account setup so that they can more effectively communicate with support.Perfectly justified reason, and a reasonable feature. But I would bet that essentially everyone at âbothâ cartas who interact with founders or investors have access, and while theoretically every break glass is logged with a justification, and those justifications are audited, every single one says âhelping company (company being accessed)â. Thatâs assuming anyone even looks at the audit trail (Narrator: they do not). reply danielheath 5 hours agorootparentprevHaving a âbreak glassâ button is common for production access during an outage - the idea being that you should never touch prod manually (instead using code reviewed changes via normal deployment), except during incident response, where you can hit the button that lets you do so anyways. reply x0x0 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve built a break glass system.The trick is you need to actually audit the use.

I don&#x27;t know the contents of these emails, but I assume it was something like, \"if you ever want to sell, ask your founder to opt-in to CartaX.\" I don&#x27;t agree with this practice, and Henry apparently also said \"sending marketing emails to investors is at best poor taste if not just wrong\"[1].In my opinion this case is a bit different, because not only are they apparently advertising Liquidity to investors, but Karri is saying they are trying to broker deals and close sales through back channels without the founders knowing or opting in to Liquidity.Either way, in my opinion this history adds a bit of evidence to support this is a wider problem in how Carta employees treat data privacy.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;MarwanRefaat&#x2F;status&#x2F;1357820073918910464#m reply skmurphy 6 hours agoprevKarri Saarinen tweeted this today (Jan 6) at 8:36am https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;karrisaarinen&#x2F;status&#x2F;1743672776643535015 he provides a helpful perspective on why Carta might be tempted to leverage customer information to facilitate transactions. This buy order was for $2.5M, they take 2% transaction fee from the buyer and seller. We pay them about $10k a year for the cap table management but this transaction alone would net them $100k. So I can see the temptation. reply xivzgrev 5 hours agoprevWhat a petty response.I was expecting more of a statement: Carta does not spam or solicit our customersâ investors.

    "title": "The Birth of Ultima: Pioneering CRPG and Tile Graphics",
    "originLink": "https://www.filfre.net/2012/02/ultima-part-1/",
    "originBody": "The Digital Antiquarian February 10, 2012 â¢ 15 comments Ultima, Part 1 Share Tweet Pin Mail SMS When we left Richard Garriott, California Pacific had just released his first game, Akalabeth, a substantial windfall for the 19-year-old university student. In between classes and SCA events, he spent his sophomore year at the University of Texas writing a new, much more ambitious game, which CP published just as the spring semester of 1981 was wrapping up. I think we can best proceed by just diving right into the game that retroactively came to be known as Ultima I. Like Zork, making Ultima available here presented a bit of an ethical dilemma for me. You can actually now buy the first three Ultima games again via GOG.com, a service I can hardly applaud enough for keeping deep catalog works like these in print in a form easily runnable on modern PCs. However, the version they sell is the Origin Systems remake from 1986. Itâs much more polished and playable than the original that Garriott wrote in BASIC on his Apple II Plus, but itâs of course also something of an anachronism for a digital antiquarian like me. So, Iâm going to go ahead and offer here the original California Pacific Ultima as Apple II disk images along with the original accompanying documentation, at least until someone tells me not to. If youâre following closely along with my journey into the game, or want to do some digital archaeology of your own, have at it. If, on the other hand, youâre a bit less hardcore but your interest is piqued enough to want to give Ultima a shot, by all means go for the much more playable and accessible version youâll find on Good Old Games â no emulator required. By the standards of later Ultimas, the packaging of Ultima I is spartan: the two disks, a very to-the-point 10-page manual, and a player reference card that, oddly, includes important information not included in the manual (and vice versa). No lengthy books of lore, no cloth maps, no ankh medallions. Yet by the standards of its time, in which games were just transitioning from Ziploc baggies to more professional packaging (a symptom of the slowly encroaching professionalization of the industry as a whole), itâs a fairly generous production. More ephemerally, this first Ultima experience feels like the CRPG experience that so many fans would come to know over the next decade, the era Matt Barton calls the âGolden Ageâ of the CRPG: a big experience promising many hours of adventure from its garishly illustrated outside to the multiple disks found inside. (In fact, Ultima is the earliest game I know of to spill across more than a single disk side.) And that impression stems from more than just the details of its presentation. If Zork in some sense perfected the text adventure by hitting upon a robust approach to interactive fiction that still persists to this day, Ultima, one could argue, did much of the same for the CRPG. Like Zork, Ultima is perhaps the first example of its form that one might actually want to play today just to, you know, play. So letâs boot our Apple II and have at it, shall we? Until very shortly before its release, Ultima was not called Ultima, but rather Ultimatum. We can see evidence of this by listing the directories of the disks themselves; the file holding the title screen you see above is still titled âPIC.ULTIMATUM.â Why choose that name? Like so much in Garriottâs early games, simply because it sounded cool; certainly this title has no more bearing on the gameâs plot, such as it is, than does the name Ultima. The change was made when Garriott and California Pacific discovered that there was already a tabletop war game in print under the name Ultimatum. Wishing to avoid confusion and legal complications, it was Al Remmers of CP who suggested that they shorten the name to simply Ultima because, once again, it sounded cool. (Later apologistsâ attempts to construe the name as a reference to the semi-mythical classical land of ultima Thule are about as convincing as their attempts to construct a coherent narrative arc out of the random smorgasbord of plot and setting of the first three Ultima games.) Remmers, you may remember, also suggested that Garriott take his occasional nickname Lord British as his nom de plume, drumming up a promotional campaign for Akalabeth depicting Lord British as a reclusive and enigmatic genius. Itâs ironic that Remmers, a guy that Garriott didnât know that well and with whom he would soon have an ugly falling out, essentially created the two brand names for which Garriott will forever be remembered, while he himself faded quickly into obscurity. Itâs also emblematic of the uncanny luck that seemed to follow young Garriott around, luck which brought various older and (possibly) wiser men to further his career almost in spite of themselves. Remember also John Mayer, his ComputerLand manager who convinced him to sell Akalabeth in the store and by some accounts was responsible for bringing it to the attention of Remmers and CPâ¦ Just like Akalabeth, Ultima â shown on the right in the comparison above â dumps us into an overhead view of the outdoor landscape after we create our character. Unlike in Akalabeth, we now have monsters to contend with out here as well as in the dungeons. And if Ultima is still not exactly a graphical extravaganza, things sure do look a whole lot better than before, thanks largely to the gameâs major technical innovation: tile graphics. Ultimaâs world is a pretty big one, spanning four continents each many times the length and width of a single screen. At a resolution of 280 X 160, trying to draw all of this at the level of individual pixels would be untenable, both technically (even two disk sides couldnât possibly store that much information) and practically (Garriott was just one guy, and not really an artist either; nor was the the Apple IIâs library of graphics software terribly mature by this point). The solution was to draw the world using a collection of pre-rendered tiles, each 14 X 16 pixels. Each screen is thus formed from 200 of these tiles, in rows of 20 and columns of 10, laid together in a process that would feel kind of similar to doing a jigsaw puzzle or playing a tile-laying board game like Carcassonne. Ultimaâs world map is represented on the computer as just a grid of numbers specifying which tile should be slotted into which position by the graphics engine. Itâs often claimed that Ultima represents the very first application of this technique that was soon everywhere in videogames of the 1980s, one that still crops up more than you might expect even today. Being a skeptical bastard by nature, I do wonder that no one thought of it in even the relatively brief history of videogames prior to Ultima; it does seem a fairly obvious approach, after all. On the other hand, I canât point to a specific example that would give me grounds to really challenge the claim. As always, post âem (or comment âem) if you got âem. Ultimaâs tile-graphics engine was not so much the work of Garriott as of a friend of his who was the only other person to have a significant role in the gameâs design and implementation: Ken W. Arnold (not the Ken Arnold who created Rogue). A neighborhood chum of Garriottâs, Arnold worked at the same ComputerLand store where Garriott spent that fateful summer of 1980. The two sketched out the initial plan for the game together when Garriott, excited by the sale of Akalabeth to California Pacific and beginning to realize he could make money at this stuff, began work on Ultima even before leaving again for university. Arnold not only invented the tile graphics scheme but also handled the technical implementation, writing an assembly-language routine to fetch the tiles and rapidly paint them onto the screen as the player moves about the world. This routine, along with another to generate the gameâs simple combat sound effects, were the only parts of Ultima not to be written in BASIC. Garriott, unlike Arnold, had not yet learned assembly language, and thus implemented everything else in BASIC after leaving Arnold, Houston, and ComputerLand to return to university in Austin. Even with the tile system, creating Ultimaâs graphics was a challenge. From The Official Book of Ultima: âWe had to actually enter all the shapes in hex,â Garriott says, detailing the primitive process. First he and Arnold would draw them out on graph paper, then convert the graphs to binary, which in turn had to be reversed because the pixels appeared on the screen backwards. After converting it into hex, they entered the tile as data, stored it on disk, and then ran it to see if it looked right on the screen. âWe had no editors or anything, so it was a very painful thing.â Indeed, one suspects that, even in the context of 1980-81, easier ways could have been devised. Put another way, young Richard and Ken had not yet learned the value of making programs to make programs. Still, stories like the above illustrate one of the most remarkable things about these early games of Garriottâs: they were created by a self-taught kid who literally figured things out as he went along, working on a single Apple II and with none of the technical background or resources of an Infocom or even an On-Line Systems or Muse to call upon. Their ramshackle technological underpinnings may be less elegant than the Z-Machine, but they are in their own way just as remarkable. In a very real sense itâs amazing that Ultima exists at all. The world all of their labor lets us explore is based upon Garriottâs latest Dungeons and Dragons campaign world circa mid-1980, which he called Sosaria; he literally transcribed his D&D maps right into the game. As weâll soon see, Sosaria is not exactly the most coherent of milieu. A person could also say that gameplay has not progressed all that much beyond Akalabeth: we still move around the wilderness map to visit towns (for our shopping needs), castles (for quests), and dungeons (for critter bashing). One is reminded once again of Garriottâs joking comment that he spent some 15 years making the same game again and again. The person who said Garriott hadnât progressed much would be pretty unfair, however, because much has changed here too. Virtually everything is now bigger and more fleshed out, and thereâs a big overarching quest to solve. In fact, the whole philosophy of the game has moved from the Akalabeth approach of being a relatively short, replayable experience to the extended, save-game-enabled epic journey CRPG fans would soon come to associate with the name Ultima. previous post Robot War next post Ultima, Part 2 15 responses Odkin February 11, 2012 Great overview, and thanks for the ZIP download. Just a minor quibble about the original Ultima package. It wasnât two disks. They cheaped out and put the Player Master on the back side of the Program disk. So there was only one disk in the package. Iâve always enjoyed the short demo you can watch by booting the Player Master. Back in 1980 I thought the transition of the face to the skull was the height of computer graphics! Reply Jimmy Maher February 11, 2012 Iâve always thought of disk sides as being essentially separate disks when talking about systems using single-sided floppies. After all, thereâs no storage difference between a single double-sided disk and two single-sided. And yeah, the demo is good stuff. âFrom darkest dungeonâ¦ to deepest space!!!â (Or is it deepest dungeon to darkest space?) Young Richard was never shy about using exclamation points to get a point across, was he? Reply Omar March 24, 2017 I donât like commenting in public forums but I feel compelled to comment on this one. Ultima I was good. The best thing about it was the outerspace segment because it gave the player a sense of freedom. It declared that anything could happen in this game, and the possibilities were not constrained by convention. However, I donât think any game compares with the Ultima IV-VI. Especially, Ultima V in the context of IV and VI. Ultima IV: you have to demonstrate all these values and be a good person. Ultima V: Those values can be misinterpreted and corrupted. Can any moment in gaming compare with the one where the player first encounters a guard that wants you to demonstrate the virtue of âcharityâ by giving him a donation or else you go to jail? So I urge you to replace Ultima I with Ultima V in your hierarchy. Reply Denis Loubet June 10, 2017 I did the cover painting for Ultima 1 while I worked at Steve Jackson Games. Itâs acrylic and watercolor dye on Bristol board. Alas, not the best combination of media for archival purposes. I also did the Lion Rampant on the startup screen using an apple II Graphics Tablet. It was a metal monstrosity with a metal barreled stylus on a wire. As I traced off the lion outline, the dirty house current created literal spikes in the line I was drawing. I had to stop and fix these as they happened. Just thought youâd like this color commentary! âDenis Reply Jerri Kohl June 10, 2017 Denis, Thanks for info. Iâve always loved this cover.

These days... there&#x27;s a community dedicated to reverse engineering the source code for Ultima and fixing bugs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xu4.sourceforge.net&#x2F; and even a team that made a modern Apple IIe Ultima-like (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.6502workshop.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;nox-archaist.html)Another thing I realized, playing Nox archaist, is that much of the modern game mechanics already existed at that time: it was key to pay tons of attention to arming your fighters and using the right spells by your cleric and magician. I never knew I was supposed to optimize my builds when I was a kid, so my teams always ended up wimpy and dying.

Ultima and Wizardry would inspire the creation of the first JRPGs, and on it went. Maybe it&#x27;s partly because D&D was becoming popular among nerds just as personal computers were becoming semi-affordable.And it&#x27;s not even just RPGs, literally any game with the concept of experience points and levels ultimately owes some small debt to Gary and Dave. reply GuB-42 10 hours agoparentIt is interesting how Western and Japanese computer RPGs both take inspiration from D&D, but how they went in completely opposite directions.Western RPGs focused on the player character aspect, offering a lot of freedom and very little characterization. You are the adventurer and this is your story. The downside, compared to tabletop RPGs is that the story is limited as computers can&#x27;t react to every situation like human GMs can.Japanese RPGs focused on the storytelling aspect. Trading freedom for a much better developed story. You are not a player character anymore, you follow another character in a story.What they have in common is the combat and XP system, though the D&D connection is usually made more obvious in the Western RPGs. For example dice rolls are often made explicit, whereas in Japanese RPGs, you may only see the final result of your actions. reply mtillman 12 hours agoparentprevEarly DnD CRPGs are really good too IMO.

Same party as I started with in Pool of Radiance ~1995 is now somewhere halfway(?) through Pools of Darkness. Not sure if I am going to try to complete the rest of the Goldbox after that, or continue with something more modern. My queue of CRPGs to play \"once I&#x27;m done with the Goldbox games\" is getting ridiculous.Put all the games in a git repo, scripts to launch the games in Dosbox, all the game-files and documents installed from GOG (originally the ones from the old Wizworx CDROM). Version-control is great, since there is a limit to number of saves in the game. And keeping notes of every thing I do, every time I load or save, really helps keep my sanity in the branching alternative time-lines that are created when savescumming through a CRPG. reply Keyframe 12 hours agoparentprevWizardry was the shit, it&#x27;s an understatement how influential that series was. reply clemensnk 1 hour agoprevI&#x27;ve been enjoying playing a single-player&#x2F;small-scale multiplayer mod of Ultima Online inspired by the early Ultima games called Ruins & Riches.

Ultimaâs tile-graphics engine was not so much the work of Garriott as of a friend of his who was the only other person to have a significant role in the gameâs design and implementation: Ken W. Arnold (not the Ken Arnold who created Rogue).I&#x27;ll comment briefly on this as someone who spent a couple of years trying to build an Ultima-esque tile graphics game on the Apple II. Ken had a clever insight that eluded me completely: \"Don&#x27;t try to draw the tiles one at a time, dummy.\"Ken&#x27;s code was fast enough to be useful in an interactive fullscreen game because it drew an entire row of 280 pixels at once, then went back over the same row of map data, reusing the indexes for the next 14 lines in that row of tiles. There was less indirection and practically no overhead compared to drawing individual 2-byte-by-14-row block shapes.Conversely, anyone trying to draw one tile at a time would have ended up with a low update rate, or would have been forced to draw the map in a small window. Either way, a worse gameplay experience would have resulted, especially if you were (as I was) comparing your work to Ultima. reply pengaru 12 hours agoparent> A good example of the same kind of thinking, much later, would have been Abrash&#x27;s exploration of the undocumented \"Mode X\" on the MCGA cards (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mode_X), without which Wolf3D and Doom would have been much less awesome.Neither Wolf3D or Doom used Mode-X, they&#x27;re both 320x200 \"Mode-Y\" games IIRC. reply CamperBob2 12 hours agorootparentThanks -- I&#x27;ll remove that postscript, as it appears to be wrong.

Mode-X needed annoying bank switching where the first bank had pixels 0,4,8... and second bank pixels 1,5,9... and so on.

By Jerome Groopman October 21, 2019 Because the brain forms habits unconsciously, resolutions rarely work.Illustration by Jan Buchczik Several years ago, I bought a smartphone and soon came to love it. Being able to send an e-mail, look up a fact, or buy something no matter where I was meant a previously unimaginable gain in productivity. Every time I got an e-mail, the phone emitted a ping and I would deal with whatever it was, priding myself on my efficiency. Texts arrived with the tones of a French horn and were similarly dispatched. Soon, I was reaching for the device every time it made a sound, like Pavlovâs dog salivating when it heard a bell. This started to interfere with work and conversations. The machine had seemed like a miraculous servant, but gradually I became its slave. Iâd always prided myself on my will power. Like most people whoâve made it through medical trainingâwith its early mornings and its long shifts when your friends are partyingâI had an established track record of delaying gratification. It didnât matter. When I tried switching the phone to silent, I ended up checking it perhaps even more often, just in case there was something to deal with. The only time I managed to resist was during Shabbos, when I donât read e-mail. But Iâd be watching the clock, counting the hours till I could turn the thing on. For the first time, I could imagine what itâs like to be a smoker craving a cigarette. Checking the smartphone had become a bad habit that I couldnât break. Habits, good and bad, have long fascinated philosophers and policymakers. Aristotle, in the Nicomachean Ethics, surveyed existing notions of virtue and offered this summary: âSome thinkers hold that it is by nature that people become good, others that it is by habit, and others that it is by instruction.â He concluded that habits were responsible. Cicero called habit âsecond nature,â a phrase that we still use. And when Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 27, considered how to create citizens who would obey the federal laws of the newly formed republic, he used another proverbial phrase: âMan is very much a creature of habit.â If federal law permeated matters at the state level, it would seem part of everyday life. âThe more it circulates through those channels and currents in which the passions of mankind naturally flow, the less will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compulsion,â he wrote. In the modern era, habits have become a significant area of scientific inquiry. Psychologists have explored the genesis of habitual behavior and its impact on health and happiness. William James, echoing Aristotle, wrote, âAll our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits,âpractical, emotional, and intellectual . . . bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny.â Few of us like to think of ourselves in such passive terms. What about will power? Marketers flatter our sense of agency with slogans like âJust Do Itâ (Nike) and âDeclare Your Pathâ (New Balance). Much popular psychology, too, bolsters our belief in self-control. In the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, devised by Walter Mischel, in the nineteen-sixties, children were seated alone in front of a marshmallow and were scored on whether they resisted gobbling it down. The resulting determination of a childâs level of âexecutive functionâ supposedly distinguishes lifeâs winners and losers, predicting such things as performance on the SAT, duration of relationships, and career success. But how can that be, if weâre just creatures of habit? In âGood Habits, Bad Habitsâ (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), the social psychologist Wendy Wood refutes both Jamesâs determinism and glib exhortations to be proactive, and seeks to give the general reader more realistic ideas for how to break habits. Drawing on her work in the field, she sees the task of sustaining positive behaviors and quelling negative ones as involving an interplay of decisions and unconscious factors. Our minds, Wood explains, have âmultiple separate but interconnected mechanisms that guide behavior.â But we are aware only of our decision-making abilityâa phenomenon known as the âintrospection illusionââand that may be why we overestimate its power. The executive functions that make will power possible give us, she writes, âthe sense of agency that we recognize as âme.â â But that comes at a cost in terms of effort. To go about our lives, we need to make some behaviors automatic. Functional MRI scans have given researchers a peek into the respective neural networks that are active during rote and conscious tasks. A brain scan of someone learning a task shows activity in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, networks associated with decision-making and executive control. With repetition of a task, brain activity moves into areas of the putamen and the basal ganglia, deep in what Wood calls âthe rudimentary machinery of our minds.â There, a task is turned into a habit. These more primitive areas of the brain demand less of our mental energy. Whole sequences of actions become linked, a process known as âchunking.â When we get into a car and drive off, we donât need to think about the separate actions of buckling a seat belt, turning on the ignition, putting the car in drive, checking the mirrors and the blind spot, and pressing the gas pedal. All these steps, chunked into a single unit in the memory, are triggered by the environmental cue of getting into your car. This frees us up to concentrate on what most requires conscious attention. We can think about where weâre going or the dayâs tasks, and keep an eye out for anything unusual on the road. Woodâs research originally focussed not on habits but on persistence. For âone-off, occasional behaviors,â like getting a flu shot, conscious decisions were all that was required. For behaviors involving repetition, though, habits were crucial. William James estimated that âninety-nine hundredths or, possibly, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of our activity is purely automatic and habitual.â This was a guess; Wood, however, devised a study to quantify just how often people act out of habit. Using a research technique known as experience sampling, she had participants spend two days recording what they did while they were doing it. Results varied across the groups studied, but the basic finding was that our actions are habitual forty-three per cent of the time. This explains why conscious knowledge is not in itself enough to change behavior, and why public-health initiatives that educate people about healthy choices tend to fail. In 1991, the National Cancer Institute determined that only eight per cent of Americans were aware of the recommendation to eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables daily. A national campaign was declared: 5 a Day for Better Health. Six years later, thirty-nine per cent of Americans knew about five servings a day, a nearly fivefold increase, but actual diets had barely changed. In 2007, government officials tried again, launching a program called Fruits & VeggiesâMore Matters. Even so, by 2018 only twelve per cent of Americans ate the recommended two servings of fruit daily, and only nine per cent ate three servings of vegetables. Simply informing us of whatâs good for us doesnât work, because so much of our eating, cooking, and shopping is governed by habit. In Mischelâs marshmallow experiment, only a quarter of the subjects were able to resist eating the marshmallow for fifteen minutes. This implies that a large majority of us lack the self-control required to succeed in life. But a less discussed part of the study suggests a way of circumventing our frailty. The researchers compared the results of two situations: in one, children could see the marshmallow in front of them; in the other, they knew that it was there but couldnât see it. On average, the children lasted only six minutes when presented with visible temptation but could manage ten minutes if the treat was hidden. For Wood, this outcome shows that self-control is ânot so much an inherent disposition but instead a reflection of the situation we are in.â A few tweaks to our environment may enable us to emulate people who seem more disciplined. A study of self-control among college students bears out this hypothesis. The students were told to report every time they thought, âOops, I shouldnât do thisââfor instance, when they stayed up too late, overslept, overate, or procrastinated. They were most successful at adopting productive behaviors not when they resolved to do better, or distracted themselves from temptation, but when they altered their environment. Instead of studying on a couch in a dorm, with a TV close by, they went to the library. They ate better when they removed junk food from the dorm refrigerator. âSuccessful self-control,â Wood writes, âcame from essentially covering up the marshmallow.â Even people who score high on self-control questionnaires may owe their apparent virtue to situational factors rather than to sheer fortitude. A study of such people in Germany found that they reported resisting temptation surprisingly rarely. âThey were living their lives in a way that hid the marshmallow almost all the time,â Wood writes. This observation leads to the crux of her bookâs thesis: the path to breaking bad habits lies not in resolve but in restructuring our environment in ways that sustain good behaviors. Wood cites the psychologist Kurt Lewin, who argued that behavior was influenced by âa constellation of forcesâ analogous to gravity or to the fluid dynamics that make a river run faster or slower. Those forces work depending on where you are, whoâs around you, the time of day, and your recent actions. We achieve situational control, paradoxically, not through will power but by finding ways to take will power out of the equation. The central force for eliminating bad habits, according to Wood, is âfrictionâ: if we can make bad habits more inconvenient, then inertia can carry us in the direction of virtue, without ever requiring us to be strong. She cites the ways in which increased friction has produced a decline in smoking: laws that ban it in restaurants, bars, airplanes, and trains; taxes that have helped triple the price of cigarettes in the U.S. in the past twenty years; the purge of cigarettes from vending machines, and of tobacco ads from TV and the radio. Meanwhile, however, businesses all around us try to reduce friction. A cashier taking an order at McDonaldâs is scripted to ask, âWould you like fries with that?â This simple question encourages us to eat more fat and carbs. Binge-watching on Netflix or Hulu is facilitated by the way that the next episode starts automatically as the credits roll on the previous one. Wood talks to M. Keith Chen, a former head of economic research for Uber, who explains that the app was designed to minimize friction. âThe phoneâs GPS knows where you are,â he says. âYou donât even need to think about it. . . . You get out without handling cash.â The tendency of companies to act as our enablers was extensively examined in Charles Duhiggâs best-seller âThe Power of Habitâ (2012). Like Wood, Duhigg, who when he wrote the book was a reporter at the Times, notes ways that the fast-food industry designs prompts to make us consume more. McDonaldâs standardizes the appearance of its restaurants, in order to trigger habitual eating routines. The foods at many chains are specifically engineered to deliver bursts of salt and fat that immediately light up the reward centers of the brain. Examining corporate efforts to capitalize on habit formation, Duhigg describes the work of an early-twentieth-century advertising guru, Claude C. Hopkins, whose campaign for Pepsodent toothpaste is said to have established toothbrushing as habitual among Americans. When Pepsodent first appeared, in 1915, few people bothered to brush their teeth, and a leading dental researcher of the time pronounced all toothpastes useless. Hopkins focussed his marketing message on the film of plaque that covers our teeth; in 1917, his newspaper ads proclaimed it âthe basic cause of all tooth troubles.â In fact, plaque can be temporarily removed simply by eating an apple, and toothpastes of the time didnât remove any more of it than brushing without toothpaste did. Nevertheless, Hopkins set about amping up the dangers of plaque and telling the public that Pepsodent was the only way to get rid of it. âJust run your tongue across your teeth,â another ad read. âYouâll feel a filmâthatâs what makes your teeth look âoff colorâ and invites decay.â In just a few years, Pepsodent had become one of the best-known products in the world. Duhigg, like Wood, sees habitual routines as being driven by cues and rewards. Pepsodent wasnât the only brand that claimed to remove the film on teeth, but ingredients that it used to insure a fresh taste, such as citric acid and mint oil, also happened to be mild irritants, which produced a satisfying tingle in the mouth. If Hopkins, by making consumers aware of the film on their teeth, had created a cue, the toothpaste itself provided a physical reward. Such loops of cue and reward are powerful: if we havenât brushed our teeth, something feels wrong. Two decades after Hopkins launched his campaign, using toothpaste had become the norm for a sizable majority of the U.S. population. Hopkins, as Duhigg puts it, had âcreated a craving.â Where Wood emphasizes situational control as a way of making good habits easy, Duhigg writes about a woman who bites her nails and is advised to find something else to do with her hands that will produce a comparable physical stimulation, such as rapping her knuckles on a desk. The idea is to keep the powerful structure of cue and reward intact but to tweak the content of the routine. For both writers, though, the key lies not in breaking a habit through will power but in replacing one habit with another. Both, too, emphasize the role of conscious effortânot in resisting habit but in analyzing it, the better to formulate a strategy for reform. Duhigg describes how, after having gained some weight, he gave up getting a cookie each afternoon in the Times cafeteria. Putting a no-cookie injunction on a Post-it note was a non-starter: heâd ignore it, wander to the cafeteria, chat with colleagues at the cash register, and buy and eat his cookie. So he set about identifying the trigger for his habit, adopting five categories proposed by researchers: time, place, emotional state, other people, and the action immediately preceding the habitual one. Was he hungry, or bored, or in need of a break or a blood-sugar boost? He switched up his routine, eating a doughnut at his desk instead of visiting the cafeteria, or taking a brief stroll outside. He was testing hypotheses: if eating the doughnut at his desk didnât sate the urge to go to the cafeteria, he could rule out sugar. By a process of elimination, he determined that his habit was really driven by a need for interaction and distraction. The best replacement for a cookie turned out to be going over to a friendâs desk to chat. Wood ends her book with advice for those of us who have become hostages to our smartphones. She offers a stepwise strategy. First, recognize your dependency, and acknowledge how the habit disrupts work, social interactions, and safe driving. Next, âcontrol the context cues,â meaning identify what triggers you to grab the phone. For me, the cues are aural (the ping, the French horn) and visual (pop-ups on the screen). I already knew that putting the phone on silent wasnât enough to break the habit, but, as in the marshmallow experiment, out of sight could be out of mind. In the mornings, preparing breakfast, I found that it helped to leave the phone in another room. In the car, it went in the glove compartment. When walking around, Iâd put it in a zippered pocket. There were other ways of generating friction and making the habit harder to indulge. Turning the phone off completely was much more effective than silencing it, not because I wasnât curious about who might have e-mailed me but because turning it back on was a hassle. Wood advises us to come up with new rewards as substitutes for the ones the phone provided. I listened to music on the car radio. In the evening, instead of scrolling through tweets and e-mails, I sought out authors Iâd never read. At the end of each day, I felt calmer, and free. â¦",

Even though I&#x27;ve heard most of it before, I&#x27;m the kind of person that really needs reminding of the core message. Somehow it&#x27;s so easy to fall back into the \"willpower is the trick\" mindset. Perhaps because it&#x27;s reinforced so heavily in popular culture, as the article mentions.The article does however, in my opinion, commit a crime in bringing up the often misrepresented marshmellow experiment as some kind of fundament of psychology. The one where a child is promised a second marshmellow if they can resist eating the first one placed in front of them for a 15 minutes.Children make do with the mental faculties and model of the world available to them. They live in a world shrouded in mystery in which adults regularly break promises to them for reasons they can&#x27;t comprehend. Once the adult telling them what to do has left the room, I don&#x27;t blame the kids for feeling an urge to take a bird in the hand over two in the bush. That&#x27;s a perfectly good default instinct to have before you&#x27;ve acquired absolute trust towards friendly strangers in university buildings.Imagine a real-world analogy to this kind of experiment. Adults choosing to go for the double reward would likely be labeled naive, bad with money, or gamblers. Extrapolating to the general population is ridiculous. Mischel&#x27;s research wasn&#x27;t about that at all.From the article: In Mischelâs marshmallow experiment, only a quarter of the subjects were able to resist eating the marshmallow for fifteen minutes. This implies that a large majority of us lack the self-control required to succeed in life.(disgruntled noises) reply leereeves 9 hours agoparentWell said. It&#x27;s often presented as a study on willpower, self-control, delayed gratification, etc, but it&#x27;s also a study about trust.And looking at it that way, it&#x27;s not surprising that a child who grows up in an environment where strangers are trustworthy will be more successful than a child who doesn&#x27;t.Perhaps the sad take-away should be that a large majority of us lack the supportive environment required to succeed in life. reply augustk 8 hours agorootparentAnother source of error is that not all children are equally obsessed with candy. reply braingravy 8 hours agorootparentEspecially those exposed to different diets. reply m0llusk 37 minutes agoparentprevI remember being given the marshmallow test as a kid. It was so blatantly condescending and manipulative that I was utterly disgusted.For one thing, I lived in a household dominated by a raging drunk father who would mercilessly beat anyone who dared to question him, let alone disobey. So, sure, I could take adult orders just fine. But that left the question as to why. Apparently this creep expected to learn something from the exercise which made me sad. And I feared having to deal with his children as peers if he had any.They also completely failed to ask or notice anything about my loathing for marshmallows. I thought they were completely awful non food and didn&#x27;t want anything to do with them ever. Just smelling them and touching them was unpleasant. So I took my two marshmallows from the encounter and gave them to the first other kid I met who wanted them. reply andrewstuart 11 hours agoprevSomeone explained to me that the subconscious mind does not like giving up something that it likes in exchange for nothing.Say for example you want to give up smoking.So don&#x27;t give up. Instead, just stop that behavior for the present time - then your subconscious is not fighting you.So you want a cigarette? Well sure OK you can have one, but defer that decision to have it for some period of time. Maybe start with 30 seconds. Build up the defer period. See if you can defer that cigarette for 1 minute, 2 etc etc. After the defer period has elapsed, if you still REALLY want the cigarette then have it - don&#x27;t fight your subconscious mind.Eventually, you&#x27;ll have deferred that cigarette essentially indefinitely. You never \"gave up smoking\", so your subconscious hasn&#x27;t been forced to get you back in line by reestablishing the cigarette smoking behavior that it likes.Even with this strategy, it still took me hundreds of attempts to give up cigarettes. Those things are addictive. reply JoeAltmaier 11 hours agoparentDidn&#x27;t Mark Twain say \"I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about quitting smoking.

You cannot avoid taking action if you want the outcome. There is nothing more to it than taking action. You know what the action required is, do it.\"On the topic of going to the gym a (very fit) friend of mine said:\"I do not give myself a choice. I do not negotiate it with myself daily. I do not discuss it with myself. I just go.\"When you hear people say \"I don&#x27;t have time to do X&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z\" then translate that to \"I do not prioritise X&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z high enough to actually do it.\"You currently set priorities for yourself every day, every minute, every hour.If you do something, it is because you prioritised it higher then everything else. reply LordDragonfang 9 hours agorootparent>You know what the action required is, do it>If you do something, it is because you prioritised it higher then everything else.This is exactly the sort of non-actionable advice that the article says doesn&#x27;t work, though.

Both times went relatively easy, the tricks were 1) make sure to scrub everything from everything smoking-related, 2) don&#x27;t have friends who smoke, and 3) make sure you have $stuff to do (work, games, TV, books, whatever).Especially 1) and 2) are what this article is about: make it harder to do $bad_thing and don&#x27;t be reminded of it.I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to quit if cigarettes were easily available to me. reply glitchc 10 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s still just willpower, usually people need more. A combination of willpower, friction and substitution is usually effective. reply andrewstuart 10 hours agorootparent>> That&#x27;s still just willpowerNo it&#x27;s not. Willpower is a brute force decision to stop and then fighting the urge until you beat the urge.Deferring a decision to do something for increasing periods of time is not fighting yourself. The key is that when the defer period is up, you either do the thing such as smoking a cigarette - unless you are OK to defer a little further. You&#x27;re not in a fight with yourself. It&#x27;s just that eventually the defer period becomes so long that its same as stopping entirely.A strategy of deferring doing something is working with your subconscious mind, not against it. reply glitchc 5 hours agorootparentWhen temptation strikes, deferring that temptation is an act of will. Saying \"not yet\" and \"not now\" doesn&#x27;t make it any easier and feels no different from \"no\" to the part of your brain that&#x27;s craving it.Most people have to have that cigarette&#x2F;drug&#x2F;etc right away, present conditions be damned. Distancing one&#x27;s mind from the strong craving requires immense self-control as it&#x27;s very uncomfortable, perhaps even painful, to do so.You need another tool.

I never intentionally decided to \"quit\".It just suddenly happened that I had zero desire to smoke, so I didn&#x27;t anymore.I still work out regularly, and it&#x27;s been 10 years now since I&#x27;ve had a cigarette. reply LoganDark 8 hours agoparentprevThis reminds me of a story I hear from time to time, about how monks quit bad habits. They practice mindfulness, which is staying aware of the habit every time they feel tempted. They still indulge in it, but they make sure they&#x27;re always doing it on purpose, fully aware of their actions.Once they&#x27;ve turned it from a compulsive behavior into an intentional one, they can stop.

It&#x27;s trying to take control of the actual act of doing the thing. Being self-aware about its harm doesn&#x27;t count.So, you&#x27;d have to realize what you&#x27;re doing before you get out the cigarette. The aim is to do it without relying on the compulsion so that the compulsion will eventually go away.It&#x27;s not just thinking about it really hard. reply bmicraft 7 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t mean to suggest smokers trying to quit only think about how bad it is once their cig is lit. I don&#x27;t understand your suggestion; that one can be more self-aware than noticing one doing something. reply LoganDark 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not about self-awareness, is the thing. If you notice you&#x27;re doing something after you&#x27;ve already started doing it, then you already did it compulsively, without thinking. The goal is to start doing it on purpose so that the compulsion doesn&#x27;t even have to happen at all. By doing this, you teach your brain that you don&#x27;t need the compulsion anymore. reply bmicraft 7 hours agorootparentIs there any research to suggest that&#x27;s a real thing? It certainly does not sound like something that should be possible when you put it this way. reply cout 5 hours agorootparentI read a paper recently that proposed that procrastination involves a slow increase in anxiety as a deadline approaches and a stimulus that is conditioned by the removal of that anxiety. That is, chronic procrastinators receive a greater reward when they wait until the deadline. This is supported by animal studies.It is possible that there is a similar mechanism here. The choice to delay gratification is akin to procrastination; the urge itself becomes a conditioned stimulus reinforced by the strong reward of delaying gratification until the scheduled time. reply LoganDark 7 hours agorootparentprevNot aware of any research on it, no.

The author of that research was making similar statements, although the focus of the research was different.The problem I had with what they were describing was that they basically defined away willpower. That is, it felt like they basically said \"once you control for all the downstream effects of willpower, willpower no longer has an effect.\" If you think about it, what&#x27;s really the difference between saying \"I&#x27;m not going buy cigarettes anymore or have them in my house\" and willpower and environmental control?There was more to it than that but that was the gist of the thing. They defined willpower so extremely narrowly that it didn&#x27;t have the same meaning anymore, and it wasn&#x27;t clear what would be left.But it was several years ago and I haven&#x27;t followed the literature closely.I can see how just willing yourself to not do something, in itself, is probably not enough, but I&#x27;m also not sure how you can do that without it resulting in a whole set of things that collectively probably define the consequences of willing yourself not to do that thing. That is, removing something from your environment, or removing yourself from the environment, changing your attentional focus, finding something else to occupy your motivations, and so forth. reply anon84873628 10 hours agoparentYes, great point.In learning about people with ADHD I learned that it is actually a constellation of possible executive function disorders. There are many different aspects or subtypes of executive function, such as time management, working memory, impulse control, etc.Then you realize that \"willpower\" isn&#x27;t a real thing; it&#x27;s just a vernacular term that ambiguously refers to some aspects of executive function.And people with lots of innate executive function have a very hard time understanding what life is like for people who have less of it -- which seems to be what you observed and made you feel skeptical.There is something to be said for \"use the types of executive function you do have to compensate for the ones you don&#x27;t\". These become the strategies that neurodiverse people use to function where necessary. But it requires very deliberate analysis and practice; it&#x27;s not as easy a simple how-to article or list of tricks. reply navjack27 8 hours agorootparentThank you for taking the time and learning the ins and outs of ADHD and executive functioning. reply armchairhacker 9 hours agoparentprevThe thing with dieting is that you have to maintain some sort of diet to maintain the weight loss. And that means unless you maintain a diet which requires minimal willpower, so that you&#x27;re no longer \"suffering\", you&#x27;re required to suffer almost every day for the rest of your life.I think many people are actually good at delaying gratification: suffer unbearably for a few minutes, intensely for a few days, or mildly for a few months. But everyone who suffers long-term eventually burns out, and people who are forced to suffer long-term past burnout (e.g. forced to work intensely to survive, or experiencing chronic unbearable pain) experience so much stress it changes them physically.Furthermore, food addiction is unique because, unlike drugs, you can&#x27;t \"quit\" food entirely. I imagine it becomes easier to avoid smoking or heroin if you haven&#x27;t done so for years (though maybe I&#x27;m wrong on this point), but food is constant, so unless you form \"healthy habits\" (AKA eat food which both satiates you and maintains your weight) the suffering never goes away. I&#x27;m fortunate to not have weight issues myself, but as a long-distance runner, I know hunger, and it&#x27;s not something you can live your entire life with. I also know that it&#x27;s not always as easy as \"have a cheat day every once in a while\", because if you&#x27;re really lacking nutrients, you&#x27;ll feel hungry no matter how much you eat, that hunger only goes away after time (and presumably for some people with serious metabolic issues, it never goes away).The good news with weight-loss is that we&#x27;ve done so much research, we have a lot of tools and techniques so that even people with metabolic issues can be satiated. Not even pills (which are probably only required for a minority which truly have metabolic issues), many people can probably maintain long-term weight loss with diet alone. The key is, these people maintain the weight by sticking to a diet which isn&#x27;t suffering to them, like one with whole foods (which are known to be more satiating). Even then, you&#x27;re maintaining constant willpower by not choosing the less-satiating but addictive processed foods, but it&#x27;s not a willpower which makes you \"suffer\". reply broscillator 10 hours agoparentprevThe way I view it is fairly simple: the things you list involve planning. Willpower is how you react in the moment.You could phrase it like this: the willpower to resist going out and getting cigarettes is much easier to perform than the willpower to not grab a cigarette that&#x27;s in front of you.However \"will power to resist going to the store\" isn&#x27;t really utilizing will power to stop smoking, it&#x27;s having an effective strategy that relies on knowing how hard it will be for your future self to actually employ that will power if the cigarettes do reach your desk. reply antwerp1 12 hours agoprevItâs just like decision fatigue: your capacity for it diminishes the more you use it (within a given time range).Instead, carefully curate your identity .

Without deep examination about WHY you do The Thing, that is a very hard thing to do because all the triggers and incentives for you to do The Thing continue to be present and push you back towards doing The Thing. Saying someone lacks Willpower is often a fancy substitution for judging them for a moral failing.This is largely why the \"war on drugs\" has failed to make any meaningful headway into stopping drug problems (and how despite more money than ever being poured into the war on drugs, the \"opioid epidemic\" still happened). This is why the \"calories in To me \"will power\" comes from precisely the process you are describing, the self interrogation into the source of these negative behaviors, examination of how they hold you back, and anticipation of what you might be able to achieve if you master them.That may be how you describe it, but just hop into any discussion on Wegovy here on HN (or anywhere else) and observe the number of people who \"don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s so hard to just eat less\". Or again, look at the entire war on drugs.Willpower defined as a deep interrogation of your incentives and psychological state and making fundamental changes not (just or even mostly) to your behavior but to the environment around you and the incentives you are responding to, possibly and including accepting that your are unable to change your current environment and incentives and are therefore also unlikely to make the change in behavior you are attempting, is definitely not the norm.Or to put it in a way that might make more sense to the HN crowd here, not deleting the prod database is as easy as making sure your not on prod when you do destructive things. But putting your prod stuff behind a VPN, having different logins, sanity checks and non-destructive capable default access to prod are all things that will make the chances of you never deleting prod a lot higher than just \"be more careful\".

Where does the wood go as it burns? Gasses, mainly CO2 (though there is some residue left in the form of ashes; much much less than the initial amount of wood). Where does the fuel from your fuel tank go when you drive? Again, gasses out of the exhaust, except for a small amount of soot and other small particulate matter.Weight loss is burning the fat reserves in the body, very similar to burning wood or fuel (but in a more controlled manner; there are no flames). The CO2 leaves your boy through mouth and nose by breathing. Burning sugars is good too: burning it before it gets converted to fat prevents it from contributing to the fat reserves.Pooping makes no difference: poop is simply the non-digestible portion of your food that. It will make its way out of your body, but never contributes to fat and sugar reserves in the body.Neither does sweating, by itself: you loose water, which needs to be replenished (it will result in short term lower weight, until the water is replenished; doesn&#x27;t help against overweight, but is used in boxing and judo etc. to get in as low a weight class as possible). Again, doesn&#x27;t affect fat and sugar. But when sweating is the result of physical activity, that physical activity does help loose weight.When doing physical exercise, you&#x27;ll notice you have to breath deeper and&#x2F;or faster. That&#x27;s to provide more O2 to your body, and to release the CO2 that is produced. Even during rest the body continually burns some fat and&#x2F;or sugar, with the produced CO2 being expelled the same way. So yes, you lose weight by breathing it out. But that breathing out more CO2 has to be triggered by a higher metabolism, such as can be achieved through physical exercise. reply ur-whale 11 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;OCuQK reply BaculumMeumEst 11 hours agoprevGood thing I didnât read such a bullshit defeatist conclusion before I dropped 40 lbs 7 years ago (adopted sane diet, never gained it back) and dug myself out of a deep hole of alcohol dependence.havenât beaten the habit of falling for engagement baiting headlines though i supposedo not let yourself believe you are weak or a victim reply Lucky-026 11 hours agoparentI didn&#x27;t read this particular article but I&#x27;ve heard of other studies that express the same idea.

On the flipside however this can lead to fatalism of the \"if I can&#x27;t change anything why even bother\"-kind.If you want to form a habit of doing sports for example, it certainly makes a difference whether you see yourself as a unsporty lazy-ass that will never achieve anything, or whether you see yourself as a unsporty person still looking for a way to get into this and make it part of your life.What I think is important is to break habits out of band. If you are eating unhealthy or too much a good starting point is to limit your food ordering, cook yourself more. And then you can control what you can cook by buying the right things in the right amount. Ideally you don&#x27;t go grocery shopping hungry then.So make following your habit the thing that requires extra steps and is complicated, while the better alternative should be easy, available and fill you with some sort of joy. For me jogging became about listening to new music albums or my favourite podcast while exploring new parts of town. So instead of just moving my body, the sports part was actually just a nice side effect to an activity I actively enjoyed.Sure, depending on your condition, such simple tricks might not work for everybody, but my point is: The mind is powerful. It tricks you into many bad habits, it can also trick you into the good ones if you wield it the right way.Raw willpower alone will not help you, you also need to identify patterns and avoid creating situations where you fall back, depending on your situation this might mean even things like totally restructuring your life, cutting off contact, moving somewhere else, etc. reply Ferret7446 9 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a difference between \"sheer willpower\" and \"wanting to change and putting in effort toward habit breaking strategies\". There&#x27;s quite a lot of knowledge about habit forming and breaking, and one of the key strategies is to set up measures so that you don&#x27;t have to rely on willpower during the key moments when you&#x27;re being tested.People need to have the \"willpower\" and commitment to change themselves, that is different from expecting them to not do drugs when they&#x27;re in withdrawal and holding the drugs in their hands.This is why there are things like gambling blacklists, where gambling addicts can register themselves so that they can&#x27;t relapse in a moment of weakness. They need the willpower to register themselves so that they don&#x27;t have to rely on the willpower to not go into a casino when they pass by. reply s1artibartfast 10 hours agoparentprevI think that is because it is a terrible message.

Willpower is one of the ways to do that, but others are more successful on more people.The reason why so many people hire a coach for physical activities, diet or even life decisions isn&#x27;t so much that these are extremely specialized domains that need high expertise; it&#x27;s that having someone make the decision, i.e. not relying on willpower, is often more effective and easier. It also leads to accountability: you have to show results to someone else, not just to your brain. And for most people, that&#x27;s also more effective and easier than willpower.Telling people to get over themselves and take charge is generally a well-meaning, but often misleading call to action. And after a couple of failures, the lesson they&#x27;ll learn is that they&#x27;re weak and ineffective and there&#x27;s nothing that can be done about it, which compounds the problem instead of solving it. reply s1artibartfast 9 hours agorootparentI think there is a fundamental misalignment here about what constitutes willpower.The coach isn&#x27;t a contradiction to willpower.

By Western Broadcasting Corporation (North Rhine-Westphalia) The Hungarian composer GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti called the relationship between New Music, Westdeutscher Rundfunk and the city of Cologne a \"triumvirate\". It was an inseparable connection that made WDR a pioneer in the development and promotion of an entirely new musical production process. For months, composers were able to experiment here for the creation of never-before-heard sound constructions, to fiddle with tape snippets and noise generators, to play with ring modulators and octave filters. For the Fonologica Musicale at Milan Radio and the Institute for Sonology in Utrecht which followed, and for the leading studios in Tokyo and New York: for all of them, the WDR Studio for Electronic Music, founded in 1951, was the ultimate role model, the mother of all studios, and the first place in the world to work entirely in the field of electronic synthesis, i.e. without any instruments or conventional sounds. The Studio in Cologne was, rather, the main focal point in the development of electronic music. What Wimbledon is for tennis players and Wembley Stadium for footballers, the WDR Studio was for the new composers of that time. Receiving an invitation there felt like being knighted. If you were allowed to experiment there, you had made it. And it was with correspondingly immense respect and awe that most sound artists approached the place. The composer and subsequent Artistic Director York HÃ¶ller (born in 1944), looking back to 1972, when he created his work Horizonte here, said that he had been determined \"to work in a really concentrated way and not just play around with things, as might have happened at other studios, because he wanted to live up to the tradition.\" So how did it all begin? However did this revolutionary institution come to be founded, six years after the end of the Second World War, six years after the end of the Third Reich, under which some art was classified as degenerate and electronic music was frowned upon? Of course, people had been interested in designing and producing new sound structures, especially in connection with the new medium of radio, long before the Nazis came to power in 1933. Even in the 1920s, radio stations and university institutes were open to the idea of trying out and developing new instruments and coming up with new technical and musical ideas. One example of this was the Radio Research Institute that was set up by the Prussian Ministry of Culture in Berlin in May 1928 and abolished by the Nazis in 1935. The Research Institute was seen as a laboratory for new sounds, but also carried out research into the sound film technology that was becoming popular in 1929 and into early ways of storing music on discs. Among the pioneers of electric music who came and went at the Berlin Research Institute were Oskar Sala, Friedrich Trautwein, and Paul Hindemith. î· Vocoder - Demonstration 1949.12.28 00:00 WDR was considered a pioneer in the field of electronic music at an early stage, explaining to listeners how a vocoder worked as early as 1949.The WDR Studio for Electronic Music is regarded as having been born on October 18, 1951, when, at a meeting at the then North-West Germany radio station, the decision was made to set up a studio for electronic music: This was 10 days after the contemporary music concert series Musik der Zeit celebrated its premiere with a performance by Igor Stravinsky. Participants in the October 18 meeting, who were key protagonists in getting the studio off the ground, included: Robert Beyer (1901â89), a radical innovator in the art of sound, had a vision of tone color music as early as the 1920s. The physicist and phoneticist Werner Meyer-Eppler (1913â60), who did a lot of work on sound synthesis and was the first to coin the term electronic music in 1949. Fritz Enkel, the technician who designed the first set-up for the studio. And, of course, Herbert Eimert (1897â1972), the musicologist who was thrown out of the Cologne University of Music for writing a paper on Atonal Music Teaching, but later became the first Director of the WDR Studio for Electronic Music Eimert's first words when the first program The Sound World of Electronic Music was broadcast in the Musikalisches Nachtprogramm (Musical Evening Program) series on October 18, 1951 sounded like a warning: \"Please don't be alarmed, the few bars that you have just heard are simply setting the tone for our evening program.\" That first broadcast was about the 12-tone theory in Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus novels: explained on the piano. It was an indication that not everything that came out of the Studio for Electronic Music was simple fare and was not intended to be. î· Herbert Eimert 1951 Vocoder, Filter & Co 00:00 Still on the first evening Herbert Eimert gave an introduction to the sound production of electronic music. People consciously wanted to create something new in the post-war years. They wanted to counter the weaponization of music by the Nazi dictatorship, a time when Bruckner, Beethoven, and, of course, Wagner and their works were appropriated for the purposes of pathos and propaganda. It was a question of stopping the misuse of music. What's more: they wanted to take the emotion out of music, so that it could never again be made vulnerable, open to attack, and subject to use for the wrong purposes. Serial music was a further development of Arnold SchÃ¶nberg's 12-tone technique, the unwieldy soundscape of composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, and Luigi Nono: of no use to autocrats. Advances in technology also opened up new ways of playing around with entirely new kinds of sound creation. Among the first works produced at the WDR Studio were Herbert Eimert's Klangstudien I and II. They were a foretaste of what was to come in the decades that followed. î· Herbert Eimert 1957 Anmoderation 00:00 Herbert Eimert brought the secrets of electronic music to interested listeners in the WDR radio broadcasts. In December 1957, Eimert spoke about the first live concerts of compositions from the studio as well as about the challenges and difficulties in general. Herbert Eimert's musical interests were a good example of the expansion of 12-tone music with elements of serialism, as referred to previously. Eimert himself was in charge of the Studio for 12 years, until 1963. At the same time, until 1957, he also lectured on the Darmstadt Summer Course for New Music. As a professor at the University of Music, he was also in charge of the Studio for Electronic Music there, from 1965 to 1971. He worked with Hans-Ulrich Humpert, his successor at the Electronic Studio at the University of Music, on a lexicon of electronic music. Shortly before the manuscript was finished, on December 15th, 1972, Eimert died in DÃ¼sseldorf. But let's get back to the WDR Studio for Electronic Music. Of course, in the early days, many musicians and composers were overwhelmed by the new equipment and first had to learn how to use it. Composer Gottfried Michael Koenig, the permanent studio engineer, helped numerous colleagues who were still clueless about new developments in electronic music to produce their works. For example, Koenig produced Henri Pousseur's Seismogramme and Bo Nilsson's Audiogramme by himself in this way. The music theoretician and composer Herbert BrÃ¼n later recounted how Koenig had initially sent him to stand in a corner and watch the work in progress. The composers who were invited were always, as Herbert Eimert put it, \"suited to using this equipment, specially commissioned by the radio channel,\" and the studio was then entirely at their disposal for up to three months, for them to make their ideas a reality. The WDR Studio soon became a meeting place for members of the innovative musical avant-garde. Karlheinz Stockhausen, who succeeded Herbert Eimert as Director of the Studio in 1963, was a frequent visitor here. This was a place not just for composing but also for discussion. The composer Konrad Boehmer (1941â2014) once described it like this: \"The Studio was the place where these discussions took place. It was in the basement and you had to go down in a musty little lift, into a really small studio, which, if there were five or six people in it â¦ â¦ was already full. It looked more like a student room. There were never enough chairs, so people sat on the filters and generators â¦ â¦ at the time they were still really sturdy, iron cans, and people smoked so much you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. It was a cross between the Florentine Camerata and a bohemian bar in Paris.\" There was a big discrepancy between, on the one hand, people's ideas, visions, and expectations, which were unbounded, and, on the other, the limited technical capabilities of the studio. Or, as Konrad Boehmer put it, the technicians and composers found themselves stuck \"in a dialectic between the woeful technology and their fertile imaginations.\" Yards of tape looped in all directions around the studio. Whereas, at the start, instruments like the Trautonium and the Melochord were still part of the Studio, those instruments soon disappeared, leaving gray metal boxes such as pulse generators, a pure tone generator, noise generator, filter, ring modulator, and much more besides. Gottfried Michael Koenig summed it up in a lecture in January 2000, when he said that it was no longer a question of writing down a note as a C, an F flat, or a G sharp, like it always used to be in music. Now a composer would say: \"I need a sound at 483 Hertz,\" and the technician would set 483 Hertz on the generator. But from the 1970s, the studio lost its monopoly position as a technological pioneer for the creation of electronic music. Other studios around the world were more modernly equipped, especially in view of the increasing importance of digital sound synthesis from then on. Mauricio Kagel (1931â2008), the Argentinian composer who came to Cologne in 1957, was later appointed Director of the Institute for New Music at the Rheinische Musikschule in Cologne and then succeeded Karlheinz Stockhausen as Head of the Cologne Courses for New Music (until 1975). He said once, looking back: \"I was impressed by the fact that composing electronic music was regarded as an activity that deserved a permanent place in the program.\" He also admitted that: \"The Studio gradually became like a waxworks museumâworthy of Madame Tussaud's, because nothing was updated, technologically or aesthetically and it all gathered dust, both literally and metaphorically. By 1967, I sensed that there was unlikely to be any change of direction at the Electronic Studio.\" Even though other studios around the world may to some extent have been better equipped, with more modern technology, the Studio in Cologne never lost its huge importance as the pioneering center of the genre of electronic music. In 1987, the Studio moved out of the main WDR building and into a building owned by the broadcaster in the Annostrasse, a few kilometers away. It remained in use there, by Karlheinz Stockhausen and the Artistic Director York HÃ¶ller, until 2001. Then, after exactly half a century, no-one had any use for the studio any more. The equipment was removed and stored in a cellar in Cologne-Ossendorf. As part of the move, thousands of tape recordings of composers working in the studio were systematically recorded in a database, completely digitized and set up as a closed collection in a magazine in the WDR broadcasting center. â¦ such as Kontakte, the famous composition by Karlheinz Stockhausen, which was created here in the WDR Studio. In 2017, the search for a permanent home seemed to be over, and an agreement on a move to Haus MÃ¶drath, Stockhausen's birthplace, seemed within reach, but the plans fell apart in early 2020. In an exclusive interview with \"Google Arts & Culture,\" the former head of programming at cultural radio station WDR 3, Professor Karl Karst spoke about the studio's place in the history of music, its importance to WDR, and also about his hopes for keeping the studio in the long term. Until 2021 Volker MÃ¼ller took care of the legacy. Volker MÃ¼ller started work as a sound engineer here in 1971 because he wanted to \"do something new and exciting.\" He worked here for 30 years, with Stockhausen and many other important musicians. For many years, Volker MÃ¼ller has kept coming back to Cologne-Ossendorf and visiting the studio in exile in the cellar thereâin the hope that one day a more worthy location will be found where a museum can be created that is open to the public, to commemorate such a unique place in the history of German music. In the summer of 2020, Volker MÃ¼ller gave an exclusive interview for \"Google Arts & Culture\" in which he talked about the special features of the studio, about his work and about important artists who worked here. In February 2021, exactly half a century after he took up his position at the WDR studio in 1971, Volker MÃ¼ller died suddenly and unexpectedly - and with him one of the last contemporary witnesses and most profound experts of this unique technology. His name will forever have a permanent place in the history of the WDR Studio for Electronic Music. We bow our heads in great gratitude. RIP Volker MÃ¼ller (1942 - 2021).

I definitely have a feeling that experimental music has become a lot more niche since relations softened, the extra funding and promotion has dried up a bit, and now the world of that music has moved almost entirely to the back rooms of various universities. reply nerdponx 14 hours agoparentI think some of this has to do with the people making experimental music. All the noise artists I know would be pretty averse to the idea of government grants to work on their music, it&#x27;s just against their whole ethos. reply AlecSchueler 12 hours agorootparentI get you, though I do think of the noise scene as having a somewhat separate lineage to the more academically focused dialectic of the WDR and places like IRCAM which still operates.I can see both sides of the argument about publicly funding music but for me the big differentiator is that something which is publicly funded will inevitably be publicly debated, and I think that critical attention can be very important in creating cohesive schools of thought in art that can have enough appeal to make a difference. reply squarefoot 12 hours agorootparentprev> All the noise artists I know would be pretty averse to the idea of government grants to work on their music, it&#x27;s just against their whole ethos.I&#x27;m sure their government isn&#x27;t buying their music but simply letting them put something on the table while they spend their life making music.

There was a lot of pandering to China from the studios back then because they held onto the hope that the market in China would open up to them more. But it never really materialized. reply DasIch 8 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t need a conspiracy theory here when there is a far simpler explanation:China has 1B potential viewers&#x2F;customers that hollywood wants as an audience to grow and increase profit, so they&#x27;ll do their best not to anger the chinese government. As a consequence movies avoid showing China in a bad light and they avoid topic that could get movies censored or forbidden in China. reply zwieback 16 hours agoprevPublicly funded radio and TV in Germany was a mishmash of entertainment, education, news reporting but also music production. Entire symphony orchestras and Jazz bands were part of the state-run stations. Private broadcasting didn&#x27;t exist, maybe wasn&#x27;t allowed then.Not surprised to hear about electronic music being funded as well, the public networks had a reputation of being somewhat elitist and high brow. reply a2800276 1 hour agoparentJust a small correction. They are not state-run but run by a sort of public trust. There are meticulous mechanisms that are intended to keep the public broadcasting system independent of government influence. These work to some degree, and are just ridiculous boongoggles in other cases. E.g. to be independent, they are not funded by taxes, but have their own non-government agency (GEZ) that collects broadcast fees. Nowadays every household has to pay, but even a couple of years ago you could opt out if you didn&#x27;t have a TV or radio. The GEZ had a special squad of investigators to check if you owned a TV or radio.All in all it works fairly well, but it is somewhat elitist and panders to a strange bouquet of special interests that strangely mirror the composition of its \"neutral\" governing body.All in all though, German radio is pretty good and public television isn&#x27;t dominated by ads and has high quality content, especially if you are into more high-brow cultural productions. And the news are excellent. reply nwellnhof 15 hours agoparentprev> Entire symphony orchestras and Jazz bands were part of the state-run stations.They still are: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rundfunkorchester reply CrypticShift 16 hours agoprevI admire two things here: the hardware aesthetic, which is just beautiful, and the pioneering spirit, which is extremely daring.That said, I&#x27;ve got a bone to pick with the standard narratives in electronic music history.

They&#x27;re a part of the same history, just different parts.Of course, the latter probably wouldn&#x27;t exists without the former, most music software emulates what we already were doing in hardware after all, albeit a lot more flexible.It&#x27;s also way more fresh, even I as a youngster (~30y) can remember that, compared to all this initial hardware innovation where I wasn&#x27;t even around to experience.That said, I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of articles about the history of DAWs and plugins, is there not? If there isn&#x27;t, sounds like the world is waiting for someone like you to put it together :) I for one would read it for sure. reply CrypticShift 13 hours agorootparentIt is certainly not irrelevant, and it certainly is at the basis of most DAW&#x2F;vst stuff. But, there are still a lot of new ideas around. And you do find some historical articles [1]. No books I know of, though; I wish I could write one :)I suspect the high complexity and decentralization of the community&#x27;s evolution leave scholars disoriented. It is the same story for the music being made (with these same tools) itself; the genres exploded around 2000, and most popular music histories speak more of the Beatles than the last 25 years.And a final point: these new tools (and again, the resulting music itself) are sometimes brushed aside as &#x27;low brow&#x27; in academic electronic music circles.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38864623 reply TheOtherHobbes 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much that&#x27;s particularly innovative in the technooloy and working metaphors of the DAW&#x2F;VST stuff. It&#x27;s 95% emulations of a conventional pop&#x2F;rock music studio from the 60s&#x2F;70s&#x2F;80s.Musically there&#x27;s been quite a bit of innovation, but nothing like the incredible step from pre-war music that was 100% acoustic and hand-written, to post-war electronic music that was synthesized from scratch, assembled from found sounds, and sometimes computer generated.Computer music - in the sense of music made using code tools, not software as an emulation of hardware - is still under-explored. There&#x27;s been plenty of it in academia, but most of it isn&#x27;t that interesting. The only real stand-out piece I can think of is the THX Deep Sound.I think there will be an explosion of code-generated music eventually - with or without AI - that also has emotional and visceral impact. So far most code music feels shiny, slippery, and weightless to me, in comparison to mainstream pop and traditional acoustic music. It lacks the finely controlled detail and depth of both. reply timc3 9 hours agoparentprevNot really. Iâve been around music tech before and after that point.

Npm has its flaws and while there are such abuses like everything package, is-odd, left-pad, etc there are also many useful packages like vue, sortable, etc without which development will be a huge pain.So not asking rhetorically, if we had all the insight and knowledge we have now, how would you make it different? reply cxr 7 hours agoparentI know it&#x27;s five hours later and this question has already spawned dozens of responses, but it&#x27;s worth thinking and speaking clearly if we&#x27;re trying to arrive at a solution for something. We can start by saying exactly what we&#x27;re talking aboutâhow do you make what different? Because you mention npm \"and their policies\" but then switch gears and talk about \"is-odd\", which is not a policy issue. It&#x27;s rather something else entirely.If you want answers, state clearly what _specific_ problem you&#x27;re trying to solve. Whatever the solution to it might be, vague and fuzzy questionsâwhile magnets for chatter since they can stand in for whatever someone wants to read out of themâare not the way to get there.(You could say that this is needlessly tedious because everyone already knows what we&#x27;re talking about, but that this isn&#x27;t true is exactly my position. It&#x27;s certain that something like half the people reading, thinking, and writing are have in mind one thing, while the other half are thinking of anotherâand the third half are thinking about something different from either of those. We&#x27;re also programmers, so dealing with tedium and the constraints of having to be explicit should be second nature.) reply 6510 3 hours agorootparentYou design a language for a purpose (which could be anything) you develop and mature it&#x27;s features to better fit it&#x27;s use case.html, a crappy defective xml implementation refuses to grow up, js, while great for little html tweaks is not adopting any of the useful features found in popular npm packages.

It seems in the Javascript ecosystem, developers have no awareness of costs of complexity.When you wonder whether to add a dependency, you should ask yourself: What are the upsides and downsides of adding this dependency. One downside is always that by adding a dependency, you add a potential security problem, a potential point of breakage, and more complexity.There are situations where these are well justified. If your dependency is stable, from a trustworthy source, and if it is a functionality that you cannot quickly implement yourself. But if you include a dependency that is effectively one line of code, the question answers itself: The costs of adding a dependency is completely unreasonable. It your list of dependencies grows into the 100s, you&#x27;re doing something wrong. reply charlie0 12 hours agoparentprevDevs working with core developers to create more 1st party packages would be a good start. I don&#x27;t need 12 different implementations for sorting on Vue&#x2F;React&#x2F;[insert spa framework of the month]. I just need 1 really good sorting library. With it, we can move to less overall dependencies on random packages. reply strken 9 hours agorootparentThere are two massive reasons why js got here, with a million packages for tiny things and a culture of using them: browser cross-compatibility requiring complicated workarounds for easy-seeming tasks, and the introduction of promises + async&#x2F;await to node.js after the standard library already used callbacks.When you combine those together you end up with a situation where \"normal\" js code not from a library can&#x27;t be trusted on the front end because it won&#x27;t work for x% of your users, and offers a clumsy API on the backend that you&#x27;d prefer be wrapped in a helper. Developers learnt that they should reach for a library to e.g. deal with localstorage (because on Safari in private mode the built-in calls throw an error instead of recording your data and discarding it after the tab closes) or make a HTTP request (because node doesn&#x27;t support fetch yet and you don&#x27;t want to use the complicated streams and callbacks API from the standard lib) and they propelled that culture forward until everyone was doing it. reply hnlmorg 8 hours agorootparentModern JavaScript reminds me a lot of BASIC, Pascal and other 70s and 80s languages. Even C pre-ANSI.Weâve been blessed in recent years that either languages are fully open source and come with a reference implementation, or a standards body governs the implementation detail. Sometimes even both.Whereas JavaScript is really more a group of languages, each with their own implementation quirks.ECMA was intended to bring some sanity to all of this. And itâs definitely better than it was in the JScript days of IE vs Netscape. But there isnât anything (that Iâm aware of) that defines What should be a part of the JavaScript standard library.Wouldnât it be great if there were a libc in the JS world.

Which is a waste once you use more than one. reply Uehreka 12 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t need 12 different implementations for sorting on Vue&#x2F;React&#x2F;[insert spa framework of the month].This feels like a bit of a strawman, since sorting is already in the standard library and there arenât in fact popular sorting packages for each framework (that would in fact be ridiculous).If you want to start a real debate though, bring up date&#x2F;time pickers.There are multiple date picker, time picker and datetime picker packages for each framework, and there are debates with good points on all sides about whether the browser-provided pickers are sufficient, or whether this is an area where a level of customization is needed and what that level is keeps changing as people discover new ways of designing date&#x2F;time pickers and new use cases arise that require different tradeoffs. Itâs both really frustrating but also kind of understandable. reply int_19h 10 hours agorootparentThere are still so many basic things that aren&#x27;t in the JS stdlib, though. A good example is Map - if you need to use a tuple of two values as a key, you&#x27;re SOL because there&#x27;s no way to customize key comparisons. Hopefully we&#x27;ll get https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tc39.es&#x2F;proposal-record-tuple&#x2F; eventually, but meanwhile languages ranging from C++ to Java to Python have had some sensible way to do this for over 20 years now. reply sroussey 4 hours agorootparentItâs not key comparison issue:const idx = [1,2] const m = new Map m.set(idx,\"hi!\") console.log(m.get(idx)) &#x2F;&#x2F; outputs \"hi!\"console.log(m.get([1,2]) &#x2F;&#x2F; outputs undefinedThat last line has created a new array object, and Map is made to be fast so checks equality by reference. Ah, which is what you to be able to change. I guess you would want to pass a new map a comparator function, so that it does a deep equal. That would be faster than what you would have to do now:const idx2 = String([1,2]) m.set(idx2, \"yo\") console.log(m.get(idx2)) &#x2F;&#x2F; yo console.log(m.get(String([1,2])) &#x2F;&#x2F; yo reply int_19h 8 minutes agorootparentThat is precisely a key comparison issue. That is why I spoke about a tuple of two values; tuples by definition don&#x27;t have a meaningful identity, so reference comparison is utterly meaningless for them.Stringification is a very crude hack, and it doesn&#x27;t even work in all cases - e.g. not if a part of your key still needs to be compared by reference. Say, it&#x27;s a tuple of two object references, describing the association between those two objects.Either way, the point is that this is really basic stuff that has been around in mainstream PLs for literally many decades now (you could do this in Smalltalk in 1980!). reply moritzwarhier 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is a trivial way to have custom key comparisons: write a function that returns the key you want. You can implement equals() using some kind of serialization, or using a lookup table of references - whatever you want!Of course, Records and Tuples would greatly simplify the process. reply int_19h 26 minutes agorootparentWriting a key comparison function is not a problem. The problem is that Map does not have any way to use such a thing; it always compares using a predefined equality algorithm that is by-reference for all aggregate data types. reply paulddraper 3 hours agorootparentprev> since sorting is already in the standard libraryRight.

I&#x27;d be very surprised if anyone looks at languages with strong standard libs and says \"I wish they had the kind of sorting I can pull in from npm\" reply forrestthewoods 11 hours agorootparentprevYour argument seems to be \"just write good code instead of bad code\". My argument is \"the best way for good code to exist is to enable and support multiple options\". Because if you have only one option and it&#x27;s bad then you&#x27;re screwed with no recourse. C++ and Python have, imho, many horrible API designs and we&#x27;re stuck with them forever. This is stagnation.Rust has a good standard library and also a large community of libraries. Sometimes those community libraries get promoted to std because they&#x27;re strictly better. Sometimes the std version of hashmap is slow because std insists on using a crytographically secure hash when 99.99% of use cases would be better served with a less secure but faster hashing algorithm.Like many things in life the ideal scenario is a benevolent dictator that only makes good choices. In practice the best way to get something good is to allow for multiple choices. reply spencerchubb 4 hours agorootparentForgive me for nitpicking your Rust example but you can define your own hashmap that inherits from the standard hashmap, and give it a different hash function. I have done it. reply int_19h 10 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with this argument is that JS also has many horrible API designs. That seem to be replaced by equally horrible API designs, just with a faster churn.Meanwhile, the horrible C++ and Python API designs at least offer the needed functionality, even if the code looks ugly. reply MetaWhirledPeas 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause who is going to bother working on any packages if they risk rejection in the end?

But I think the correct conclusion is just that Python&#x27;s standard library is bad.Go has a big standard library too and it&#x27;s mostly very well designed, useful and avoids fragmentation.I think a similar thing happened with compiler warnings and C&#x2F;C++. The language is error prone so people want warnings but a lot of the warnings don&#x27;t have good solutions (e.g. signedness mismatches) so people tend to ignore them. Also they aren&#x27;t easy to control, e.g. from third party dependencies.So some people got the idea that warnings are fundamentally wrong and e.g. Go doesn&#x27;t have them. But my experience of Rust warnings is that they are totally fine if done right. reply rfoo 42 minutes agoparentprev> how would you make it different?Make the cost of reusing software non-zero again.It doesn&#x27;t have to be as painful as C++ without package managers, but should make every developer spend about 5~10 minutes labor work for adding each direct dependency, or one minute for each new dependency in the dependency closure. reply jonorsi 8 hours agoparentprevIâve started thinking package management has too much trust now. Ideally, but probably unpractically, projects should check in their packages like they used to under &#x2F;lib or &#x2F;third_party, and be much more suspicious of new package dependencies.Basically, you would need to start accepting that you are responsible for any dependencies you choose to include. Any upstream changes you would need to evaluate and bring in or patch yourself.Definitely an impossible task given how broad and deep modern package dependencies are, but at least youâd start feeling the insanity of having all if them in the first place :P. reply quickthrower2 3 hours agorootparentIf NPM made some tweaks this might become trivial.

If they are literally malware, they can be manually removed by npm admins. If a court orders a takedown due to copyright, that&#x27;s also something npm admins can handle. If you want to be able to un-publish, then just publish on your own server (or github etc).If analyzing the dependencies for showing in the NPM web UI, while analyzing, as you exceed 40 direct or transitive dependencies, abort and highlight this package in red, for having excessive dependencies.If installing locally, you get what you get, don&#x27;t install random or crazy packages, stick to well known high-quality minimal-dependencies packages. nodejs does include file reading and writing, http server, http client, json ... that will take you pretty far.

Even if the original source goes away, they should have a copy of every version of the library ever fetched via their tool, and devs can continue to build existing stuff.(If you don&#x27;t want Google to see what packages you&#x27;re fetching, you can also turn this off with an environment variable.) reply notnmeyer 12 hours agoparentprevi donât know how you fix this for js, but in general i think well designed and robust standard libraries are a great place to start.the community shouldnât need to write a bunch of tiny utility packages to do common things.in other words, make it easier to avoid the deeply nested dependency mess that js encourages. reply int_19h 9 hours agorootparentThis problem is a symptom of \"move fast, break things\" mentality that pervades the JS (and, more broadly, the web) ecosystem. The result is an ecosystem that is specifically optimized for moving fast and breaking things - which is a lot easier when the stable core is tiny. reply TobyTheDog123 12 hours agoparentprevThe entire reason this is a big deal is that people don&#x27;t know what their dependencies are. The left-pad incident wasn&#x27;t a big deal because it was pulled, it was a big deal because no one could easily fix their builds and didn&#x27;t even know they were depending on it, because it was a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.While it&#x27;s ridiculous to expect that people will audit every single dependency and sub-dependency, it&#x27;s not ridiculous to expect tooling to do the same.Packages should be given an overall quality rating (and honestly it might be great for an ecosystem as large, diverse, and welcoming-to-beginners as JS&#x2F;TS), part of the score comes from the number of different dependencies&#x2F;sub-dependencies -- a social package score if you will. If a package causes the dependency graph to explode, give a warning before installing it.Then, if you&#x27;re NPM, you don&#x27;t need all of these convoluted and exploitable policies around un-publishing. reply matheusmoreira 2 hours agorootparent> While it&#x27;s ridiculous to expect that people will audit every single dependency and sub-dependencyIt&#x27;s not ridiculous at all.

Why not have everyone in the world code review asp.net and dot net libraries for every single website project at that rate? reply sakjur 3 minutes agorootparentRustâs Cargo vet offers an answer to that question.You can import a list of audits from trusted auditors, which should cover all popular packages. Now you have to audit dependencies that arenât well-known in the community, which really is the set of dependencies that you should take an extra look at. The big popular JSON libraries can be audited by either Microsoft or some of the other large projects that are using them.Youâd explicitly share your trust list in your audit file, and anything (updates or new packages) that isnât trusted by you or one of your listed auditors is flagged for auditing.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mozilla.github.io&#x2F;cargo-vet&#x2F;index.html reply quickthrower2 3 hours agoparentprevSoft deletes. You can delete a package and it stops being advertised but a shadow copy of referenced versions are kept for anything that depends on it. NPM spews warnings when this happens.Once the referencing packages are updated are deleted or modified the shadow versions can be dropped. reply ShadowBanThis01 10 hours agoparentprevI never used Node and went right to Deno, partly because NPM and packages sounded like a mess. So far it has been a good experience. reply aaomidi 12 hours agoparentprevHonestly, how go does package management is pretty good. reply speedgoose 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s personal tastes perhaps, but I don&#x27;t find the appeal of packages management in Golang. I find PIP, NPM, RubyGems, Nuget, Cargo,â¦ easier to work with. The go.mod syntax is what it is, and doing updates or fixing conflicts isn&#x27;t easy.Not having a registry is neat, but I&#x27;m also unsure of what is going to happen over time as dependencies may be moved or removed. You can see that with old Maven pom.xml where some dependencies do not resolve anymore. reply mseepgood 0 minutes agorootparent> I&#x27;m also unsure of what is going to happen over time as dependencies may be moved or removedThat&#x27;s what the Go module proxy is for.

Nothing on earth has caused so much pain, misery, suffering and agony, apart from possibly PHP.Our devops guys scream from the seething pain whenever the have to debug some pile of shit that decides it won&#x27;t build unless all the runes are aligned precisely and all the RAM in the universe is available on the build runners. And pushing this to the developers results in importing more packages thus adding to the burning tyre fire.And after several hours of builds and 9000 layers of packages you wake up one morning and in that 50 meg chunk of javascript that is excreted from the process, someone managed to inject a \"Slava Ukraini!\" banner into your web app. reply ironmagma 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sorry, but there is no chance that the automake&#x2F;autoconf suite of tools has caused less pain than `npm install`. reply cybrox 9 hours agorootparentprevI mean... just don&#x27;t install everything then?Over-reliance on third party dependencies is a choice.

For the last year+, every time I&#x27;ve opened GitHub, I&#x27;ve been met with the same undismissable banner.Since the only choice they give you is to contact support, I did. Unfortunately, their support team is not responsive, and has a completely separate notifications system. It took an inordinately long time for them to respond. (I have poor reception here so I can&#x27;t check, but I think it was months.) Since I&#x27;m not in the habit of checking GitHub Support for new messages, when they eventually replied, I missed it. I had to start a whole new ticket. That too was months ago, and I still haven&#x27;t heard back.So because I did some work for a skunkworks eBay team in 2015, the top 150px of my GitHub are unusable, and there&#x27;s apparently nothing I can do about it until some call center decides to write me back. reply ruune 12 hours agorootparentYou could probably code up a simple browser extension to hide the banner via CSS if it bothers you a lot.

Reading it from the horses mouth [1] it doesnât seems like they had any intent other than trying to find out if it could be done.

Coincidentally, I just released my own semantic search engine personal project for Steam games in December.Itâs interesting to compare notes and implementation details. I have many of the same notes and faced very similar challenges in my own work haha.The most interesting challenge I found was touched on in this post. Semantic searches presented with the typical text box input generally mislead users into treating the search like a Google search.Searches like âbeautiful video gameâ and âsci-fi thrillerâ technically work, but they donât perform as well as just describing a beautiful video game or describing a plot overview of a sci-fi thriller.Semantic search kind of requires a different kind of search query that many users donât quite understand yet.Maybe thereâs an opportunity for an intermediary model to âtranslateâ queries, like how recent image generation models take your image prompt and generate a text prompt thatâs used for the image generation instead. reply Layvier 8 hours agoparentThis is a problem we&#x27;re hitting as well. Hyde (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) is a zero-shot approach to it, where from the query you generate documents that would have a very small distance to the actual documents you&#x27;re looking for. For question answering this would mean generating hypothetical answers. In some cases though, it can yield better results to generate hypothetical queries for each documents, question answering actually being one of them. That requires a lot of pre-processing though, which is not always possible. reply sakd 7 hours agoparentprevSentence Transformers documentation describes this problem as âasymmetric searchâ. Some of their models are fine tuned to better handle short queries matched to longer documents. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;examples&#x2F;applications&#x2F;semantic-search&#x2F;...)Alternatively, you could mean pool (average) the document embeddings for the most popular click results for a given query and use that as the query embedding. reply kovezd 8 hours agoparentprevBy definition, semantic search works best by similarity. Thus, the interface you are looking for, is one that facilitates selecting one or multiple objects (i.e. video games). reply netruk44 8 hours agorootparentYes, I agree. This is something I implemented in my project UI (a âmore like this gameâ button, and the ability to specify a Steam appid for using as the query).It works if there actually is a game out there you want similar games to, but the text input is useful for finding something when you donât have an example offhand. reply redskyluan 6 hours agoprevWe also built a similar semantic search engine for retrieving open-source projects. We experimented with HyDE and guessing user queries based on a corpus, both of which were very successful.For embeddings, we chose BGE, but found they seemed to overfit on Beir. CohereV3 and Voyage appeared to perform better in practice.For retrieval, we used OpenSearch + ZillizCloud Serverless + Cohere ranking, providing us with maximum flexibility and search effectiveness.To be mentioned, build a evaluation dataset is important. This helps me to improve the quality. reply dmezzetti 9 hours agoprevVery nice and comprehensive article by the author. Lots of great lessons shared in building a search system, devops and hosting an application publicly. reply Layvier 9 hours agoprevI&#x27;d be curious to hear what people think is state of the art of this kind of problem? I think the Cohere embeddings model v3 is very good, as it handles queries and documents differently to embed them in the same vector space. Otherwise for a specific use case I guess dense retrieval (which is basically a problem specific fine tuned version of this approach) is the best way to go about it? reply dmezzetti 9 hours agoparentIf you&#x27;re talking about embeddings model metrics, the MTEB Leaderboard is a good resource: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;spaces&#x2F;mteb&#x2F;leaderboard reply Layvier 8 hours agorootparentYes I had a look at it, I haven&#x27;t tried e5-mistral-7b-instruct yet but I&#x27;ll definitely give it a go.

My parents are living on a farm in the countryside and still I can get there easily by train and bus. If I need some more flexibility (moving stuff, skiing, ...), there are electric car rentals available at any major train stations. It&#x27;s my ideal version of mobility.PS: The Swiss federal railways also have a large set of open data to enable such cool projects: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.sbb.ch&#x2F;pages&#x2F;home&#x2F; reply sandworm101 18 hours agoparentCompare me visiting my parents who live in a \"remote\" town of in BC about 200km from Vancouver. After a ferry and a bus I found myself outside a grocery store asking strangers for a ride north (no taxi service). A kind soul drove me to the highway turnoff. I walked the last five miles. That&#x27;s what most of North America is like once you step slightly outside of the major cities: No car, no get there. reply pnw 17 hours agorootparentIs that surprising given that you could fit over 200 Switzerlands into Canada and another 200 into the US? BC alone is over 20 times the size of Switzerland. Cars are the best possible option in that case surely? reply Mordisquitos 16 hours agorootparentTalking about the overall size of Canada is dodging the issue. The scale of the country does provide a justification for not being able to access any arbitrary spot across Canada (or the US) using public transport, but the previous commenter is talking about accessing a town a mere 200 km away from British Columbia&#x27;s largest city and urban agglomeration â 3rd largest in Canada as a whole.How many Switzerlands can you fit within a 200 km drive from Vancouver [0]? My eyeball guess is that the area is half the area of Switzerland, maybe less than a third if we exclude US territory covered in the map. And what&#x27;s the population density of that area? Again, ignoring the US, just counting Vancouver&#x27;s [1] and Victoria&#x27;s [2] metropolitan areas alone adds up to 3,000,000 inhabitants (more than a third of the population of the whole of Switzerland), so this area&#x27;s population density is very likely to be similar or even greater than that of Switzerland as a whole.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smappen.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;map&#x2F;802yt[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vancouver[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Victoria,_British_Columbia reply sandworm101 17 hours agorootparentprevThat is correct. Cars are certainly the best option in many circumstances, even from an environmental standpoint. The reason I couldn&#x27;t get even a taxi was that the taxi company didn&#x27;t want to drive 30miles just to pick me up, then drive maybe 60miles back after dropping me off. When a small population is spread over a large area, personal vehicles become the most efficient means. That is a large part of why Alaska has the highest rate of private aircraft ownership on the planet. BC rides the literally middle ground between Alaska and the densely populated southern states. reply alamortsubite 16 hours agorootparentprevComparing all of the U.S. or Canada is meaningless, but when you look at regions with similar population densities, then yes, it is surprising. Switzerland only has about half the density of the U.S. East Coast, for example. reply johannes1234321 16 hours agorootparentAnd in addition Switzerland has challenging terrain with hills and mountains all over, making train service complicated and even busses non-trivial sometimes reply ant6n 16 hours agorootparentPn the other hand, the geography forces people to live in valleys. so population is effectively distributed along corridors â- very conducive to being served by rail and bus lines. reply panick21_ 16 hours agorootparentprevThe size in itself of is a meaningless metric. I&#x27;m baffled that comment like this still get made even on HN. I guess this must be that American just have such a fundamentally distorted view of public transport.The area of Greater Toronto Area has far denser population then Switzerland with far worse public transport. So by any rational metric it should dominate Switzerland in public transport modal shares and convenience. But it doesn&#x27;t. So when looking for explanations, we need to look deeper.Looking at BC, Vancouver is a city of 675,218 people. The Metro area is 2.463 million. Calgary metro is 1.4 million. Edmonton is another metro area of 1.3 million. And the distance between Edmonton and Calgary isn&#x27;t even very far. Those are 3 cities that are bigger or comparable to ZÃ¼rich.I&#x27;m not suggesting the population of &#x27;Liard River&#x27; of 100 people in the north of BC should have a high speed train to Vancouver. Of course BC as a whole will never have Swiss like public Transit. But if you actually look at where people live, take into account the particular details of the location, you can design a public transport system that is useful for people.But the comment said &#x27;200km&#x27; from Vancouver. And he also said there was highway 5 miles from the parents house. So somehow they seemed to think it was reasonable to able to build a highway. Highways are expensive infrastructure, and usually you don&#x27;t built them the middle of nowhere. So it seems from the comment we are not talking about some place that is at least between two places the somebody connected with a highway. If you have enough money for a highway, you can finance a bus route along it. Most people do live reasonable close together and not just a single house in the wilderness.If we look at the density map:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www12.statcan.gc.ca&#x2F;census-recensement&#x2F;2006&#x2F;as-sa&#x2F;97...It seems to me that Vancouver is perfectly placed to have an amazing transport system connecting its city to its metro and its metro to the more outlining towns and villages. There is no reason the great Vancouver area couldn&#x27;t have Swiss like public transport very every villageThen you have a higher speed train connecting Vancouver to Calgary to Edmonton and all the larger towns in between. Then have regional trains or buses going out from that trunk connecting smaller towns and villages. I suspect these town were all originally built because there was railroad there.So yes, BC as a whole is big and densely populated. But that metric alone is meaningless when designing a public transport system that can meaningfully serve the population. Even if you think &#x27;cars are the best option&#x27;, that&#x27;s no reason not have have decent public transport. Switzerland, has lots of people in cars and its a very viable option. But despite that, it also has other good types of transport. Sometimes its nice not to have only one option, specially for people who for many reasons can&#x27;t simply drive.This reoccurring attitude of well its a big country so why even try is so damaging. As if Canada being big had anything to do with why Toronto street cars are a abomination of planning and operations. You have a bit more of a point in regards to BC but even then its wrong for the majority of people. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentThe cost of building a highway compared to the cost of running even a \"once daily\" bus service may not be exactly the ratio you think it is, especially if the bus would normally run empty.A highway is a one-time cost, amortized over many uses, a bus is an ongoing cost.It would be much easier to \"stick a seat\" on some government vehicle that already does the trip regularly, allowing a passenger or two to ride along with the mail truck. reply currymj 14 hours agorootparenta lot of the more remote Swiss bus services are \"PostAuto\" and got started exactly like this -- giving passengers a ride on existing mail carriages. Now they run actual buses along the same routes (which are still bright yellow like the mail trucks). reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentThis is the way to do it - solve the problem, even if âinefficient&#x2F;complexâ and then as things grow, adapt.Regular rural route busses used to be common in the US before everyone got rich enough to own a car. reply panick21_ 6 hours agorootparentAnd if you can&#x27;t afford a car, can&#x27;t drive, got your drivers licence revoked, aren&#x27;t old enough to drive. fuck you. reply ahtihn 12 hours agorootparentprev> A highway is a one-time costNot really, especially in places that regularly experience freezing and snow. reply InvertedRhodium 9 hours agorootparentprevHighways require significant ongoing maintenance - I wouldnât be surprised to find that the cost of maintenance over the lifetime of the road exceeds the cost to build it in the first place. Particularly if the country in question relies heavily on road freight. reply bombcar 8 hours agorootparentDepends on how you define âlifetimeâ - roads last a long time (and if itâs heavily used, itâs clearly worthwhile). reply panick21_ 6 hours agorootparentIf this highway is so &#x27;heavily used&#x27; then there is clearly enough population around that asking for a bus isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. You act like I asked for high speed rail connections ever 15min to some remote village northern BC.We are talking about 200km distance from Vancouver, the major city in Western Canada. reply sandworm101 12 hours agorootparentprevHighways are more important to business than passengers. That government bus isn&#x27;t going to be hauling the logs, gravel, and any other resources that are the lifeblood of BCs economy. reply panick21_ 6 hours agorootparentprev> especially if the bus would normally run emptyIn Switzerland we often have bus service to tiny mountain villages where the bus has to drive incredibly complex snake roads up a mountain. These buses are often not all that full. And somehow we have not gone bankrupt as a country in the 100 years this has been going on.> A highway is a one-time costThat is just totally false.> a bus is an ongoing costBus has an Initial acquisition cost and an ongoing maintenance, literally exactly like a highway.The difference is that you have to pay a bus driver.> It would be much easier to \"stick a seat\" on some government vehicle that already does the trip regularly, allowing a passenger or two to ride along with the mail truck.Yes. And that exactly how it started in Switzerland. The Mail company operates the buses. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they are proper buses with reliable schedules.Today these buses don&#x27;t usually deliver the mail anymore anyway. The waste majority are just normal bus routes, just painted in a cool color.See the Old-School bus: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artifiche.com&#x2F;artifiche-images&#x2F;posters_extralarge&#x2F;24...Here you see a modern Post Bus station that is above the local railway station. There are 10+ Post platforms, going into all the surrounding vallies and then to all the different mountain villages. They are all synchronized and scheduled with train arrival times.See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bus-bild.de&#x2F;bild&#x2F;Schweiz~Betriebe~Postauto&#x2F;13802...The city where this bus station is located has only 35k people, it the capital of that whole mountain region. The next large town has 10k people. Many of the villages in the valley, often with population with 1000-2000 are of course connected by rail. Its only once you have to go up that you need the buses. And this city is 100km away from ZÃ¼rich, a much smaller city then Vancouver.That is much smaller then even many of the small cities in the greater area we are talking about. There are many cities of 100k+ around, and many other small cities of 10k-50k range.So I really can&#x27;t see how connecting any of village in that area can be such a hard burden.We are talking about a pretty populated region with lots of population. And we are not in the 1920 anymore. Just do fucking run real bus service. replybwanab 15 hours agoparentprevAnd the best part is how reliable and timely the trains and buses are. As a foreigner living there I commuted by bus into Geneva from a suburb. I don&#x27;t think my bus was ever more than 1 minute late - and this was in the middle of its run. I hate to compare that to my wife&#x27;s commute here in Boston.... reply Stevvo 16 hours agoparentprevReplace \"foreigners\" with \"Americans\". Functional public transport is not that special; most countries have it. The main difference in Switzerland is the hostility of the terrain to building infrastructure.If your parents lived on a farm in rural China, you would say the same thing. reply Tainnor 15 hours agorootparentSwiss public transport is IMHO special in three respects: a) density of the network, b) frequency (even remote areas get a bus an hour), c) punctuality.I&#x27;m not saying no other country can match this (I haven&#x27;t been everywhere), but at least Germany or Italy can&#x27;t. reply Peanuts99 14 hours agorootparentIt is bloody pricey though.

Trains that go to popular skiing locations of have places to store your equipment. There are also bikes available at most stations.> It&#x27;s my ideal version of mobility.It can decently be a lot better in a lot of ways. But we have to not just complain but try to objectively criticizes so we can continue to improve.I would like to actually do high-speed rail. Switzerland did really well improving on InterCity trains and got more people to use them. But that became almost a mantra of &#x27;speed doesn&#x27;t matter&#x27;. The actual mantra is &#x27;not as fast as possible, but as fast as required&#x27;.This was correct and with the Rail2035 plan, we are going further in that direction. Many InterCity trains go from every 30 min to every 15 min. Basically turning most of the country into an S-Bahn like system.See here if you are interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sbb-step2035.ch&#x2F;de&#x2F;personenverkehr&#x2F;But I think beyond that we should seriously consider a totally new high-speed line, right across the major population centers. That would not just make rail competitive with driving, but beat driving with a big stick. Also this would free up a huge amount of capacity from the existing lines and allow things like 15min regional and inter-regional travel. Plus it would increase cargo capacity.Sadly its currently not in the Rail2050 plan, but there are people pushing for it.Further, I think we can do a lot, a lot better in terms of biking. Compared to the Dutch we are utterly primitive in integrating biking in the larger transport network. In the Netherlands they have figured out that bikes are the optimal feeder system into the rail network and have taken huge advantage of that. Switzerland needs to do so much better in that.Frankly, I think its really useful. I was able to perfectly travel around on Christmas. Getting to family in different parts of the country, no problem. reply palata 17 hours agorootparent> That would not just make rail competitive with driving, but beat driving with a big stick.Between major population centers, I believe it already beats driving by a long shot... I personally don&#x27;t think it has to be faster: as long as I can work in the train, it&#x27;s fine if it takes 90min instead of 75.> Further, I think we can do a lot, a lot better in terms of biking.Yes! reply panick21_ 3 hours agorootparentThe main point is that a new main line would revolutionize local and regional transport as well. So even if you don&#x27;t build a high speed one, you get a lot of benefit. But once you are building new lines, might as well make it a high-speed line.And we also should consider longer distances. Sure if you are going from Bern to ZÃ¼rich 5-10min difference isn&#x27;t gone be that big of a deal (well arguably if you have millions of people doing it, it does start to matter at least a little).But even if you look at Genf-ZÃ¼rich, a new main line could cut that time by 40%-50%, from almost 3h to more like 1.5h.But what if you want to go from Southern France to Stuttgart or MÃ¼nich. From Marseille to ZÃ¼rich.We have major population density in a straight line from Genf to St.Gallen. Having a modern high speed rail connection across that population just makes sense. reply drunner 18 hours agoparentprevOne of my favorite YouTubers, not just bikes, did a video last year that highlighted this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=muPcHs-E4qc reply lqet 19 hours agoprevDoes this have real-time positions, or only scheduled positions?Personally I prefer TRAVIC, which has nearly 100% real-time coverage for Switzerland and also includes busses and trams:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travic.app&#x2F;?z=9&x=921422.5&y=5949724.5 reply zigman1 19 hours agoparentIt says it is \"an animation based on the official timetables of the Swiss Federal Railways(SBB) network\".

I was told stories of the efficiency of Swiss trains, and that I could book 5-10 min connections with no problems, but chose to be safe and do 15-30 mins. Well, I missed 3 of these connections due to delays on the incoming train. I had to queue at the ticket booth to get it endorsed for the next train. reply altano 18 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no need for anecdotes as the data is published.

Switzerland has a high standard of 3min is late. What actually important if you make your connections. In Switerland you make your connection like 98ish% of the time.This article picks out some of the worst lines over a very short time period. You can do that in most networks. Some German ICE lines have 23% on time.I ride some of those city to city pairs and those numbers don&#x27;t line up with my experiance over the last couple years. reply RealStickman_ 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure how Statista got their info, but most other countries define \"late\" as being more than 5 minutes behind schedule. In Switzeland that limit is lower with only 3 minutes not counting as late. reply eep_social 17 hours agorootparentprevCanât tell from that link but historically the Swiss punctuality standard is three minutes where other countries use five or more, Japan being the notable exception. reply snovv_crash 4 hours agorootparentprevIf the incoming train was first going through Italy or Germany the punctuality statistics are much much worse. I regularly book 5-8 minute overlaps and I don&#x27;t remember the last time I missed a connection, but this is ZÃ¼rich into the mountains mostly. reply palata 17 hours agorootparentprevIf your train is not too late, the connection will wait for you. If it can&#x27;t wait, they will tell you about the alternative.My experience in Germany is that the connection does not wait, and you just end up having to find your way yourself. It&#x27;s a bit weird when not used to it, and it seems to mean that you can basically take whatever train you want that you believe goes towards your goal. reply terminous 17 hours agorootparent> you can basically take whatever train you want that you believe goes towards your goal.That&#x27;s a big difference between Germany and Switzerland. Full fare tickets let you take any route, but reasonably priced tickets are specific to a schedule of trains. If there is a delay causing a misconnect, you have to queue at the ticket window to get it endorsed for a later specific train. And my ticket inspectors on the train seriously inspected the endorsement each time. reply Foobar8568 18 hours agorootparentprevMaybe in 2001...Nowadays 3min delays are still considered as on time as per SBB : \"A train is considered on time if it reaches its destination with less than three minutesâ delay.\" reply sschueller 15 hours agorootparentprevWhen working with the data they generally only provide live data for trips that are off schedule (a deff feed) as the scheduled data might as well be live. reply bbu 14 hours agorootparentprevNice story but that has never happened.

I stopped using it, it was so unreliable. But Google Maps can tell me exactly where the next bus&#x2F;train is, how much delayed, how crowded it is, whether security is on board or not, because Google polls actual passengers about these parameters. reply sonar_un 18 hours agoparentprevI was just on a train from Paris to GenÃ¨ve and was looking for a map just like this! reply vasile 12 hours agoprevThanks for featuring, author of the website here.

Post a comment! Create an account [â]ES_MattPES/FE 149 points150 points151 points 16 hours ago* (10 children) I guess I can clarify this, since I wrote all the assembly code used in AoE / Aok, along with many other parts of those games. There were about ~13,000 lines of x86 32-bit assembly code written in total. The vast majority, about ~11,500 lines worth, was in the 'drawing core', which drew SLP sprites in a variety of ways (mirrored, stippled, clipped). The code for this was in a separate .asm file, which was \"compiled\" by Microsoft Macro Assembler 6.1 into a .obj file. There were maybe a dozen other uses of assembly in the C++ code, as the compilers at the time supported 'inline assembly' in the middle of functions. These blocks of asm code were added using the __asm { } keyword. Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 to 6.0 compilers were the ones used to compile the games as originally shipped. The inline assembly in other functions was generally used to speed up operations like scanning areas of the map for targeting and accessing compressed look up tables, which had bit-level operations that could be reduced in assembly, but c++ couldn't express as well. The use of assembly in the drawing core resulting in a ~10x sprite drawing speed improvement over the C++ reference implementations, and AoE's drawing core was notably faster than competitors like StarCraft, which is why the default resolution 'out of the box' for AoE was 800 by 600, when nearly all our competition was 640 x 480 resolution - we could scroll the screen and fill it with sprites as fast or faster even though we had twice as many pixels-ish in the game world area. The design of the drawing core used a number of techniques that could not easily (or at all) be expressed in C++ and took into account things like the cache architecture and UV pipes of the first Pentium processors. A key speedup technique AoE used was realized during discussions I had with iD software programmer and optimization guru Michael Abrash over lunch at Tia's Mexican Restaurant in Mesquite, TX. Other speedups came from being able eliminating function call overhead and hand-managing register usage. \"register starvation\" was a real issue for CPUs in the pre-Pentium Pro era and languages like C++ were hurt by it. Additional assembly code was added in Age of Kings to add the clipped outlines of obscured units. The assembly code remained in use in AoK:HD edition (a 32-bit game) I re-wrote the assembly functions into C++ for both Definitive Editions, as they are 64-bit programs, and inline assembly was never supported by the 64-bit C++ compiler, and the vastly improved register sets and compiler optimizations made it un-necessary. Additionally, sprite drawing in the definitive editions is multi-threaded, and will use up to 4 cores for that task alone. I hope that clears things up. permalink embed save report reply [â]_henchman 10 points11 points12 points 13 hours ago (0 children) This is so cool to read and get insight on, thank you! permalink embed save parent report reply [â]Koala_eiO Enable mutual random! 5 points6 points7 points 14 hours ago (0 children) Thank you! permalink embed save parent report reply [â]Unholy_Lilith Magyars 6 points7 points8 points 13 hours ago (0 children) Interesting insights here, ty! permalink embed save parent report reply [â]Dimitrije [score hidden] 8 hours ago (0 children) Thank you so much for this amazing insight! permalink embed save parent report reply [â]Sevesys [score hidden] 7 hours ago (0 children) Loved reading this and imagining what it was like to develop it at the time, and it brings back memories of being a kid.

I just wanted to follow up and comment, I hope I didn't lead you too far astray from my first comment earlier. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]TheJoshGriffith 24 points25 points26 points 1 day ago* (2 children) Assembly was typically used for mathematically complex operations. Things like calculating damage, hit chance, etc, would be handled in assembly because back then the author of the code knew better than the compiler. Nowadays that's been turned on its head, the author tends to be a relative idiot next to the compiler. That being said, we also have vastly more powerful processors. DirectX and OpenGL were both a thing back then, and libraries would've almost certainly be used to draw the window frame itself as well as to do things like loading assets and handling input as these are fairly standard. Most \"native\" video games at the time were still vectors drawn at runtime, AoE2 being an early \"properly graphical\" game likely meant there was plenty of optimisation gains to be had by proper engineering. Edit: If anyone wants to read about a relatively famous example of the author knowing better than the compiler, a fun inverse square root function was implemented with Quake. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]Elias-Hasle 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago (1 child) The Quake inverse square root was only approximate, but good enough for the purpose and faster on the hardware of that time.

However any sane person (Chris Sawyer wasn't) try too keep it out too a minimum, because it needs lots of boilerplate, and you get little help from the compiler (you can shoot yourself in the foot more frequently). permalink embed save parent report reply [â]JakeArvizu [score hidden] 2 hours ago (0 children) If you want an example of how this was done but with a modern lens analyzing it, check out this super cool video Programming a first person shooter from scratch like it's 1995.

As such is very unlikely that any part of the DE version of AOE2 is still written in assembly. If any code which was originally written in assembly needed updating for DE it would almost certainly be more cost/time effective to rewrite the whole assembly portion in a modern language in order to make updates rather than even attempting to modify the old assembly code. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]althaz 14 points15 points16 points 2 days ago (8 children) programmers capable of it are very expensive I think it's less that programmers capable of it are very expensive (any good software dev should be able to learn to use assembly relatively quickly, either that or I gotta ask for a pay rise), it's that *programming* in assembly is very expensive because of how time consuming it is. It's waaaaay slower than using C and higher-level languages are correspondingly faster than C. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]5Volt 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago (0 children) Yeah but I was eli5ing.

Anything you write by hand will be slower than what the compiler can generate. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]5Volt [score hidden] 4 hours ago (1 child) \"I can't honestly think of a situation in which it would be actually useful to write anything in assembly anymore\" Maybe if you're using a wacky CPU e.g. A supercomputer for chemical simulations or a single purpose chip for high frequency trading. In that case you might support a wierd subset of the instruction set and it could be easier to just write in assembly rather than make an compiler play ball. Also maybe if you're writing firmware for something. I think in general you'd still be able to get away with compiling your firmware from c but every so often I'm sure you'd run into something esoteric that the compiler can't handle correctly. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]othellothewise [score hidden] 6 minutes ago (0 children) A supercomputer for chemical simulations Even then I wouldn't, most high-performance scientific code is written in C++ or (ugh) Fortran. But yeah if you need some super weird instructions or that the compiler doesn't support. Even then there are intrinsics, which are \"compiler builtins\" that essentially insert the assembler instructions without having to mess around with all the pain points of ASM like clobbering registers. In fact, if you are looking for anything high-performance, you probably really want the compiler to have at least intrinsics for the weird instructions that you are using because then the compiler will be able to optimize code around what you are doing. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]BendicantMias Nogai Khan always refers to Nogai Khan in third person[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (1 child) I can't honestly think of a situation in which it would be actually useful to write anything in assembly anymore.

There are many different types of assembly for difference types of CPU, the one for microcontrollers (the chips use for e.g. Microwave ovens or low level motor vehicle controls) are usually AVR chips which use AVR assembly. This kind of assembly is much simpler than x86 and can more readily be written by humans, though c and c++ can still compile to AVR assembly as well so a lot of the time those people would be using higher level languages too. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]JakeArvizu [score hidden] 2 hours ago (0 children) any good software dev should be able to learn to use assembly relatively quickly, either that or I gotta ask for a pay rise You should probably ask for a pay raise lol. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]jamalcalypse 22 points23 points24 points 2 days ago (7 children) is very unlikely that any part of the DE version of AOE2 is still written in assembly so that's why we have pathing issues now!

Wouldn't they just leave it as is then? Or is it not possible to code around it? Also how do you update the Assembly portion of the code if you don't already have someone who understands Assembly? Don't you have to understand it in order to translate it? permalink embed save parent report reply [â]5Volt 10 points11 points12 points 2 days ago (0 children) In reality yes they would probably be inclined to leave it alone assuming it works fine, it's possible some of that assembly code remains to this day, but leaving it alone would not work forever and would be considered bad practice. The more you change the code surrounding your assembly the more likely it becomes that the inputs and outputs to that assembly module change, or the output of that assembly chunk is no longer desirable both of which mean you have to roll up your sleeves and change the assembly anyway. Leaving the assembly as is is kind of like leaving a ticking time bomb in your code base and crossing your fingers in the hopes that it never goes off. Most engineering shops would rather address the problem pro actively by replacing the assembly before it becomes and issue. That way they can do it on their own schedule rather than having it delay a patch or release. Wrt to translating the assembly to more modern code, there is a type of tool called a decompiler which takes assembly code and tries to re create code in a higher level language(specifically usually c or c++) which is functionally the same as your assembly. A tool like this produces terrible code but it is a lot easier to understand terrible c code and re write it to be less terrible than it is to understand assembly and try to re write it in c. But also, it is in General a lot easier to read and understand assembly than it is to write it. Writing assembly means you need to know what instructions are available and how they work, if you're reading assembly you can see the instructions and then look them up in the assembly reference documentation one by one. It's a slow process but if you only need to do it once and Then rewrite your module in a better language, it is often worth the effort. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]epicbruh420420 7 points8 points9 points 2 days ago (0 children) Wouldn't they just leave it as is then?

There are no bells or whistles. In incredibly hard to program in and read. Back when I was doing it in uni it was often easier to just delete sections of code that were buggy and rewrite them than search for the bugs. Many other languages take the code you write and convert it to assembly. In ye olden days these conversions weren't particularly efficient so if you wanted efficiency, you wrote the code in assembly yourself. In modern times these conversions are a lot more efficient and we have more powerful computers so this isn't really necessary. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]Marsdreamer Byzantines 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago (2 children) Assembly is the closest programming language to machine code. For example, in higher level languages you have the concept of an \"if\" statement; Where you can say \"If X equals 5, do something\" or whatever. In (older) assembly you don't even have that kind of base functionality. You're essentially writing specific instructions at the processor level. Something as simple as an If / Else statement or a for loop in assembly can take many lines of code as opposed to just one. Modern languages are compiled and interpreted down into assembly (machine code), but very few programmers actually use assembly to do anything anymore because it is logically very hard to follow and so basic that it makes any kind of complex programming insanely difficult. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]BigFlying_Rhino 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago (1 child) What is '(older) assembly'?

This is actually one of the main reasons some games from the 90s and early 2000s have such insane performances that made it possible to run pretty heavy 3d assets online at 200 fps+ stable like in quake 3 / insane amounts of parallel assets interacting at the same time like in RCT yet not lagging at all, and in basically toaster windows 95 machines that wouldnt even run a modern day calculator gui made in unity lol. permalink embed save parent report reply [+][deleted] 1 day ago (3 children) [deleted] [â]cocklescope 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (1 child) There absolutely are things other languages just cant do as efficiently because theres commands they dont have access to, which is what he actually said. Modern high level languages dont even allow pointer or memory manipulation. And yes ofc, they get compiled into assembly, but that argument is pointless, compilers will always produce incredibly unreadable and very inefficient (compared to whats theoretically possible) assembly to the point you would be better off remaking everything from scratch, and they wont ever \"know better\" if they dont have the whole context, case in point for interpreted languages. If youre going for assembly modifications youre already coding in assembly, apart from this only being possible in fully compiled (non interpreted, which most modern languages are, and do a real time \"translation\" to assembly little by little) languages. So yeah, you wont be manipulating registries for more efficient memory handling in python, sorry lol, and good luck trying to go into unsafe territory to optimize hardware usage with the GIL. Closest you can get to having full access to assembly level manipulation is c/c++, thats why it is still used by most libs that require efficiency and many triple As, but thats already considered a low level language by todays standards. permalink embed save report reply [â]sirprimal11 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children) But generally speaking, there's nothing assembly can do that other languages can't, even if it's for the simple fact that other languages get complied into assembly anyway.

Fun fact: A problem many early tile-based games faced was the visually awkward effect when different tiles were placed adjacently (think Warcraft I). This was traditionally addressed by having transitional tiles, which would be some function of adjacent tiles to provide a smoother, less jarring, gradient between the two. These transitional tiles were static, that is, they were authored by an artist and due to the number of potential permutations, could require a lot of them. Age of Empires' solution was to dynamically generate these transitionals from a simple mask and priority weights for tiles. This is done at runtime, and the resultant dynamically generated tiles cached. The fun part is that, for the latter majority portion of AoE2's life during the Voobly era, the cache portion has been effectively disabled due to an assumption made by the developers about available physical memory (tl;dr: if you had 4GB of memory or more, the tile caching system would be disabled, which has a massive negative impact on performance) permalink embed save report reply [â]ES_MattPES/FE 7 points8 points9 points 16 hours ago* (14 children) the cache portion has been effectively disabled due to an assumption made by the developers about available physical memory That's news to me, and I wrote that code... The rest about dynamic generation and caching is spot on though. Part of the dynamic generation is the texturing and lighting/shading of non-flat tiles. Remember this was a 256 color game, as were most games at the time, meaning we had a single fixed palette of 256 colors to work with and that was it, so things like alpha/color blending textures and lighting/shading were NOT easy to do. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]Emjayen 3 points4 points5 points 15 hours ago* (13 children) That's news to me, and I wrote that code... It's where-in the cache size is adapted based on total* physical memory; the problem is in the calculation where-in the total is being first skewed by adding 900kB first, which is causing it to overflow (for compatibility reasons, the particular call --GlobalMemoryStatus-- will always return DWORD(-1) if the machine has >= 4GB) Specifically the code is: int CacheSize = 400; if((dwTotalPhys + 900000) >> 20 > 34 ) { if((dwTotalPhys + 900000) >> 20 > 40) CacheSize = (dwTotalPhys + 900000) >> 20 > 64 ? 2500 : 1200; this->DynamicTileCacheSize = CacheSize; } else { this->DynamicTileCacheSize = 0; this->DisableTileCaching = 1; } Less an assumption and more a bug really. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]ES_MattPES/FE 7 points8 points9 points 14 hours ago (12 children) And you have this code why?

Mama told me not to say anything in these situations. String and hpPrintfInternal were both my handiwork, taken my own personal codebase(s) and brought over with appropriate licenses. String obviously was a string class, far far richer than std::string (which I'm not even sure what year it was added to the standard library) and had certain memory behaviors that were preferable. There was no string class/object used at all in the original games (1997-2000) source code. it entirely used char* and char[] with fixed buffers or malloc(). I went in retrofitted that and several other code improvements by myself into the entire original source code base at the start of the project, to make it more crash-proof among other things. 'hpPrintfInternal' was from a type-safe, ground up re-implementation of 'printf()' that extended and improved upon printf in many ways, and integrated into other classes as well. For example, you could write this line of C++ code: String fullFilePath( \"%s\\%s\\SaveGame%03d.sav\", SaveFilePath, PlayerDirectoryName, SaveGameNum ); and it would do what you would expect, but there would be exactly one memory allocation total (and it could have come from a special memory pool). permalink embed save parent report reply continue this thread [â]Emjayen 2 points3 points4 points 14 hours ago* (0 children) Yeah, we've spoken at length in the past via PM.

And when you have a specific part of the game that requires optimization, you jump to the tool that you know best. permalink embed save report reply [â]othellothewise 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago (0 children) In the past, that is. Compilers are way better at humans at optimizing as a rule nowadays. permalink embed save parent report reply [â]TotesMessenger [score hidden] just now (0 children) I'm a bot, bleep, bloop.

It seemed all done by one specific programmer, and what really saved us (in porting) the game was the originallly kept \"C\" code. My mips knowledge was never as good as x86.So yes, it was the norm back then. My second job (1998), was working on a team that was going to do some software for Intel for the upcoming back then Katmai processor (Pentium I was it). It had all the new fancy SIMD instructions. The software was supposed to be something like media composer - you slap images, rotate them, etc all in realtime using software rendering (GPUs were still relatively expensive).I wrote a bilinear and bicubic texture mapper with marching squares for transparent areas. It was all in assembly, and I spent lots of time optimizing it. Back then we used Intel&#x27;s VTune, and it was super-precise (for the processors back then) - how they are going to pipeline, how much (supposedly) instructions cycles would take, waits, etc. That helped a lot!But the real lesson was, that me and my manager - both claiming to be super good at assembly (after our recent achievements), rewrote the sphere mapping code for a game another team was writting in assembly, but alas our assembly (but no katmai instructions) code was slower than what the compiler did ;) - TBH, if we did proper mipmapping and texture swizzling we would&#x27;ve fared both ways, but hey, demo coders were not always to be found so they had to rely on regular programmers like us!flipcode keeps a lot of good articles, with lots of good assembly for that - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flipcode.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;articles.shtml - there were even better materials from earlier years, but can&#x27;t find them.Turbo&#x2F;Borland Pascal were so awesome, because they allowed for very easy of inline assembly use (somehow) than C&#x2F;C++ - though you had to know which registers you can touch or not. reply akoboldfrying 7 hours agoparentIt was always so disappointing, spending hours coding up a tightly wound assembly language version of some inner loop that uses half the instructions generated by the C++ compiler, only to find that your slaved-over version is actually 5% slower. But OTOH... the thrill when it actually was faster!This was back in the Pentium 4 era, where there were deep pipelines and oddities like some simple ALU instructions (ADD, SUB, etc.) taking 0.5 cycles(!), while others (ADC, SHR) took 4 cycles IIRC. reply chii 5 hours agorootparent> uses half the instructions generated by the C++ compileris there a tool that could profile&#x2F;predict ahead of time, so that one does not attempt to hand write assembly before knowing for sure it will beat the compiled version? reply adrianN 3 hours agorootparentFor small pieces of code I would try to use a superoptimizer like souper. reply pjmlp 1 hour agoparentprevAnother Flipcode user!I missed that other game forums of similar vintage are now gone.The way to being able to do Assembly in Borland products, and to lesser extent on VC++, was great.I always feel like vomiting when looking at the mess UNIX compilers have come up for it, instead of inferring how registers are being used, and the whole string concatenation stuff. reply philistine 7 hours agoparentprevYou worked on the port of Metal Gear Solid?! OH MY GOD THIS IS SO COOL!Edit: Looking it up you might have worked on a larger amount of games than I thought. Very awesome nonetheless. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobygames.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;company:99&#x2F;from:1998&#x2F;platform... reply malkia 4 hours agorootparentThanks!!! Yes it was MGS - the deal was with our studio to do the port from PSX -> PC and since Microsoft was the publisher, part of the deal was for Konami to port Age Of Empires (1? 2?) to PSX. reply zeusk 8 hours agoparentprevAre there any good resources on using mipmapping and swizzling effectively? reply malkia 7 hours agorootparentI was actually trying to find it - there were lots of .txt files published back then - and there was one about texture mapping from 1992... 1994? - and it explained swizzling and why it was efficient with caches. reply malkia 7 hours agorootparentNow I remember - back then these texture mappers were called roto zoomers, Alex Champandard did excellent series here ->https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flipcode.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;The_Art_of_Demomaking-Issu... - look for zip file with the source code.I&#x27;ve also found Go version (and there were 2 java ones)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;search?q=BlockTextureScreenSo it&#x27;s not as neat as swizzling (quickly looking at it) - but essentially same goal - keep pixels that have to be drawn together at close (e.g. blocks). Mipmapping helps too, as then you don&#x27;t \"skip\" too many pixels - and you both gain better quality and less cache misses. reply takiyo 7 hours agoparentprevThis was a nice read, thanks for writing. reply hoten 55 minutes agoprevYou probably need to ignore the first comment thread to see the comment of interest. reply ThePowerOfFuet 31 minutes agoparentNot any more; in any case, here&#x27;s a link to the comment in question:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;aoe2&#x2F;comments&#x2F;18ysttu&#x2F;_&#x2F;kgltqrg&#x2F; reply Havoc 9 hours agoprev>The use of assembly in the drawing core resulting in a ~10x sprite drawing speed improvement over the C++Wow that&#x27;s a chunky improvement over an already fast lang reply necubi 8 hours agoparentThis was in 1999. C++ compilers have come a long ways since then. While there are still opportunities for hand-written asm to go and order of magnitude faster than C++, they&#x27;re mostly around manual vectorization where the auto-vectorizer fails. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentYes, younger devs grown up on the myth of C and C++ being always fast, have missed the days when inline Assembly was a higher count than pure C and C++ code.I have seen applications for MS-DOS, effectively using C as a Macro Assembler, only the data structures and high level logic was C as if Macro Assembler macros. reply mysteria 6 hours agorootparentprevAnd when that happens SIMD intrinsics are often used rather than going straight into raw assembly. reply frozenport 5 hours agoparentprevFunctionality should have been provided by directx though reply puttycat 8 hours agoprev> A key speedup technique AoE used was realized during discussions I had with iD software programmer and optimization guru Michael Abrash over lunch at Tia&#x27;s Mexican Restaurant in Mesquite, TX.How many freeform interactions like this did we lose because of the Internet&#x27;s illusion of being connected? reply ahstilde 8 hours agoparentWe&#x27;ve gained many. Chatting in a discord is similar to this. reply lucb1e 6 hours agorootparentWell, yes, but I also see their point (even if I&#x27;m not sure I agree with it): by being forced to meet IRL, you&#x27;re also forced to make real contact and seem more likely to form strong relations, and it is off-the-record by default so you can share more thingsOf course, the (massive) counterpoint is that you get to talk to way fewer people, particularly if they&#x27;re more than half an hour traveling away. Quantity versus quality, but by having a lot of quantity through more diverse online interactions, you can find the conversations that have a lot of quality for you (overlapping fields of work, hobbies, or just a personality match).Which is better? Probably something in the middle, where you hang out in chat rooms but are also conscious of the advantages of arranging to meet up. I do find it inspirational (too strong a word, but you get the idea) to hear of other times or cultures where things are done differently reply sho_hn 7 hours agorootparentprevAnd IRC was even better at it. reply subtra3t 3 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think so. I know everybody loves to say that IRC is better than [insert commercial chat application] but in this particular use case discord is superior to irc imo because of the voice&#x2F;video chat features and greater convenience. reply PeterStuer 2 hours agoparentprevDon&#x27;t people still have lunch? reply walthamstow 6 minutes agorootparentThey do.

WHITHER OUR SENSE OF BEAUTY. (etc., etc., insert architecture pics to taste)C&#x27;mon dude. The opportunity for people to talk to one another about this stuff is unimaginably better than it was back then. Like, here we are, right now, me telling you you&#x27;re full of shit. What are the chances of us being able to do that in 1999?(I&#x27;m sorry to be mean, but I remember 1999 very well and it was much harder to get good information about things, and discuss things with others interested in the same topics, than it is today. And it was already markedly better then than it was even 5 years prior to that!) reply mnky9800n 45 minutes agorootparentDo you want to have lunch at Tia&#x27;s in Mesquite, Texas? reply santoshalper 8 hours agoprev [â] I love that Michael Abrash shows up in this story.
