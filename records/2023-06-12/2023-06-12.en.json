    "hn_content": "Reddit users have gone on strike against the company's senior executives over subreddits that were banned due to the fact that they had hosted hateful content or violated site rules, including r/The_Donald. While some users are returning to the site, others remain opposed to it until the millions of users who create content are happy with the site's policies. Opinions on Reddit's future are mixed, with some arguing that its changes have already hurt its business model. Despite this, many consider Reddit and other network effect businesses to be of great value and, as such, there are emerging proposals to change the definition of \"growth\" to encompass more nuanced, non-quantifiable things such as user and employee happiness.The discussion revolves around the influence of VCs and investors on the decisions of private and public companies, as well as the challenges of monetizing social media platforms. Users highlight the importance of retaining talented CEOs and founders, the impact of investor pressure on companies, and the struggles of creating profitable business models for social media. Some users draw comparisons between successful companies like Facebook and Twitter and discuss the dangers of mission creep and profit-maximization. Another user highlights the difficulty of monetizing user-generated content platforms and maintaining a healthy balance between economic interests and community values.The discussion revolves around the toxic culture within Wikipedia and StackOverflow that drives away potential users and drives down the quality of content. The cancerous moderation system in both platforms has resulted in an \"ingrown\" culture that is unlikely to change, leading to stagnating user growth and reduced contributions. Some users suggest implementing new policies to improve content quality and user experience, but this is unlikely to address the root causes of toxicity. The larger issue is that these companies are built upon network effects and two-sided markets, but the non-profit structure struggles to generate enough revenue to meet their expenses.Twitter is experiencing a decline in traffic and revenue, as well as an increase in outages, bugs, and abuse. Many users have left the platform, and the value of the company has fallen significantly. Twitter has also lost staff, with a lot of core functionality being handled by people who are trapped in their jobs by visas. Elon Musk's feuds with vendors and public support of extreme-right views are causing many to protest and leave the platform. Some users find Twitter better now, notably with the Community Notes feature, but others have experienced suspicious and inappropriate content. Despite the decline, some believe that Twitter is faster and more fun than ever, especially for users outside the US where they are adding capacity.A discussion on Reddit's recent changes and how users might resist change since the site belongs to them, along with a comparison to landscapers and painters. Some commenters express dissatisfaction with moderation tools, censorship, and various aspects of the site. Others discuss the difficulty of finding alternatives and the impact of market effects on users. The conversation also touches on the profitability of Reddit and the potential for sustainability over aggressive revenue-seeking.The discussion revolves around Reddit's business model and profit maximization goals, with some users suggesting that moderation and community-generated content are undervalued. There are criticisms of the platform's recent API changes and efforts to compete with video-focused platforms like TikTok. Some users argue that Reddit moderators are essential to the platform's success, while others believe they are a negative influence. There is a debate about the relationship between profit and sustainability, with arguments for both sides. Overall, the discussion highlights tensions between users' desire for community-driven platforms and the financial demands of running a public company.This comments thread discusses recent changes to Reddit's API and the impact on third-party app developers. Some users express concern that the changes will negatively affect the platform and lead to a loss of users, while others feel that Reddit is justified in trying to monetize its platform and reduce dependence on third-party apps. Many users express frustration with the platform's design and moderation policies. Some users are planning a subreddit blackout in protest, which may affect the site's popularity. Overall, the thread highlights the tension between monetizing a user-generated content platform and maintaining a strong user community.Reddit's decision to introduce pricing for its API has been met with criticism from users, who see the move as placing the site's community at risk. Critics argue that this new approach prioritizes monetization over maintaining a quality community and could lead to censorship of unpopular viewpoints. Reddit's new pricing model has prompted an outcry among third-party developers who argue that the charges will make their projects unsustainable. It remains to be seen if the move will stick and impact revenue growth. App makers noted the change is unsustainable for them; some believe it's just a move by Reddit to generate more revenue, while others see it as an attack on third-party clients, which have always been popular with the Reddit community.",

    "content": "INTERNET CULTURE/CULTURE/ENTERTAINMENTThousands of subreddits pledge to go dark after the Reddit CEO\u2019s recent remarks/ Fallout from the unpopular API pricing change and disastrous AMA with CEO Steve Huffman is turning out the lights on some of Reddit\u2019s most prominent communities.By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.Jun 10, 2023, 4:58 PM PDT|CommentsShare this storyReddits user and moderator community are very peeved at its CEO right now. Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeThe version of Reddit we\u2019ll see over the next few days may be a shell of itself. More than 100 subreddits have already gone dark, and thousands more plan to follow in protest of Reddit\u2019s coming API changes, according to the website Reddark, which is tracking the protests.The protests are happening over API changes that will force many third-party apps, like Apollo and rif is fun for Reddit, to shut down. Frustration was already brewing in the community as developers began reacting to the changes this week, but Reddit CEO Steve Huffman\u2019s responses in recent days have only escalated the community\u2019s pushback.In a Reddit AMA on Friday, Huffman was met with seemingly universal anger. There were a lot of f-bombs from commenters. A lot of people called him a coward. If there are positive comments, I didn\u2019t find them.Subreddit moderators and third-party Reddit app developers say they\u2019ve lost trust in Huffman and Reddit\u2019s leadership. Apollo developer Christian Selig accused Huffman of \u201cblatantly lying\u201d in a phone call to some subreddit moderators. The moderators of r/videos wrote that Huffman\u2019s AMA performance was \u201ca collage of inappropriate responses.\u201d r/funny suggested the company was \u201caim[ing] solely at your looming IPO.\u201dMost of the subreddits have pledged to go private \u2014 preventing outside access \u2014 for 48 hours, though some, like the 26 million-member community r/videos, have said they\u2019ll remain private indefinitely. According to this post on r/ModCoord, protests will end when Reddit addresses issues with the API, improves accessibility for blind people, and creates \u201cparity in access to NSFW content.\u201dRelatedReddit\u2019s API updates: all the news about changes that have infuriated RedditorsApollo for Reddit is shutting downAmong the complaints are how Reddit\u2019s leadership has, or mostly hasn\u2019t, communicated the details of changes to its API pricing or incoming restrictions, including prohibiting third-party apps from showing NSFW content that\u2019s already viewable on the site. ReddPlanet developer Tony Lupeski said it was a \u201cblatant lie\u201d that Reddit leadership was keeping dialogue open with impacted third-party developers, as Huffman wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s not an answer and you know it,\u201d said user Anacharsis to the same Huffman reply.When moderator Merari01 asked why the site hadn\u2019t tested the new changes with users and moderators, Huffman said the company \u201cstarted sharing this information in April.\u201d A few responses pointed out the earlier announcement didn\u2019t include any pricing information and left out details like the ban on third-party apps showing NSFW content.One user pointed to a post on r/AskHistorians listing times Reddit had reneged on promises.Since the AMA, some subreddits have escalated their response. Over at r/iPhone, the moderators posted early morning that their original plan was to go dark for just 48 hours, but Huffman\u2019s behavior changed their minds:Originally, the protest was planned to be 48 hours. However, after a shambolic AMA held by Reddit\u2019s CEO, it has become clear to us that Reddit doesn\u2019t intend to act in good faith. When the CEO is willing to lie and spread libellous claims about another third-party developer, and then try double down by vilifying them, again, in an AMA, despite being proven as a liar by the developer through audio recordings, that\u2019s when we knew what we were up against.Now /iPhone will be going private, severely restricting access to the sub. As will r/Music, a default subscription for new accounts and one of the largest subreddits on the site. Mods of that community put it right in the title of the post announcing its participation, which says it will close starting June 12th \u201cUntil Reddit Takes Back Their API Policy Change.\u201dr/iPhone, which has 3.8 million users, echoed r/Music\u2019s sentiment, saying, \u201cin the (somewhat unlikely) scenario that Reddit\u2019s leadership has a change of direction that sees the reversal [of] the recent API policy change, we will reopen the subreddit.\u201d r/Gaming says its shutdown will begin on the 12th, and it will be set to private \u201cfor 48 hours or longer.\u201dAt the time of publishing, a pinned bot post on the r/ModCoord sub\u2019s post about the protest says nearly 4,500 communities are pledging to go dark, while Reddark, a site tracking the protesting subreddits, says over 200 already have.Correction June 11th, 2023, 8:47AM EST: A previous version of this headline said thousands of subreddits had gone dark. That is inaccurate, they are currently planning to go dark. r/videos also has not yet gone private, as previously stated. Lastly, a mention of r/History should have read r/AskHistorians.

    "hn_content": "Thousands of subreddits are pledging to go dark after the Reddit CEO's recent remarks, indicating an overwhelmingly negative response from the community. Some have speculated about the leadership\u2019s true motivations and criticized their ineptitude. There are concerns regarding third-party apps that moderators rely on for moderation. Reddit is trying to control its user base by pushing through changes and capturing revenue from those users, while the most interesting content creators, those using third-party apps, are not valued. The majority of users are readers, with few commenters and fewer interactors, contributing to content churn. Some believe that without Apollo users and similar dedicated moderators, the quality of content and comments on Reddit will fall through the floor. Reddit's natural level of user base seems to have been reached in the US, although there is potential for growth among international audiences.The CEO of Reddit faced negative feedback during a recent ask-me-anything session, with his net karma reaching a low of -111,199 and comments approaching the negative infinity. Several users expressed dissatisfaction with his non-answers and copy-pasting detailed statements. In addition, comments on Reddit can be manipulated to show more positive votes by following the comment link from a user's profile. Community members revolted against Reddit management in the past, achieving banning of subs and changes, but some doubt whether current protests against Reddit's monitization strategy will be successful. The CEO defended the company's profit-making focus, citing profit as the reason third-party apps are more profitable and that despite an 'eat-the-rich' narrative adopted by some users, Reddit just wants to earn enough to keep growing.Reddit's relationship with Imgur has cooled off due to Imgur's redirecting of direct image links to non-direct wrapper pages to show banner ads, making it difficult for Reddit to display images on its site. Imgur was initially created as an image hosting service for Reddit. Reddit has faced user backlash over the UI changes and pushing of its mobile client. There are concerns that Reddit will lose its cultural relevance over the next 5-10 years. The comment section features a discussion on the need for a decentralized internet with user-friendly publishing tools to replace centralized platforms. Advertisers have become the backbone of the web as users become their captive audiences.The article discusses the evolution of web publishing tools and how they have failed to bring non-technical users to publish their content. It argues that the decentralized model of the internet could have made scaling a centralized service easy. However, centralized platforms require complex operations, which have resulted in many issues. The decentralized model could have created a more user-friendly web had it been adopted from the start. The article also includes comments on the CEO of Reddit's response to third-party developers. Nevertheless, the comments are mostly criticizing the CEO's lack of professionalism.The CEO of Reddit, Steve Huffman, hosted an Ask Me Anything (AMA) where he addressed the company's profitability and the role of their free/cheap API in their success. Critics suggested that the company's behavior towards their community has caused a breakdown in trust, and that the company is essentially a freeloader on the community's value creation. There is debate on whether for-profit entities are the only ones capable of running and sustaining large online communities or if non-profit organizations and open protocols could also do so. Some are pointing to the demise of Reddit and the need for profit sharing mechanisms to ensure the sustainability of online communities. The community members have also discussed alternatives to Reddit, such as Usenet and Lemmy.- The value of large online communities comes from infrastructure, network effects, and brand recognition rather than \"the community\" as commonly claimed.\n- Reddit-like companies provide little to no unique value to the world, and if they shut down, another company would rise to do the same thing.\n- Without a Reddit-like company, the communities on Reddit wouldn't all be on the same site.\n- Investors have a right to expect profit from their investment in Reddit.\n- Reddit's primary motive is profit, but for long-term survival, it's essential to become profitable.\n- Reddit depends on the existence of the communities on its site and vice versa.\n- Reddit's costs are at least $400M per year, and they get over $400M from ads.\n- The good apps are free and don't show any ads, which makes it difficult for Reddit to compete and make money.The controversy surrounding Reddit's decision to limit access to its API, which has led to third-party apps going dark, has sparked a variety of opinions on the platform. Some users feel that Reddit exploits its communities, while others argue that the company needs to make money to keep the platform viable. Critics also point out that Reddit's API pricing structure, which is comparatively expensive, is part of the problem. Despite the backlash, it remains to be seen whether the boycott will have any lasting impact on Reddit's user base. Some users are deleting their accounts, while others believe that the vast majority of users won't care and that Reddit will continue to thrive despite the controversy.No meaningful content provided.",

(John Youngbear/AP)Listen4 minComment473Gift ArticleTed Kaczynski, the anarchist and so-called Unabomber who died in a federal prison medical facility on Saturday, transformed from boy genius to terrorist, going from a star mathematics student to a feared assailant who targeted academics, scientists and industrialized society as a whole.Ted Kaczynski, who planted fear and death as the Unabomber, dies at 81Kaczynski entered Harvard University as a 16-year-old on a scholarship, after skipping the sixth and 11th grades. It was there that he was subjected to an experiment run by Harvard psychologist Henry A. Murray that was backed by the Central Intelligence Agency. Though he graduated with a mathematics degree, later completing a doctorate in the field before becoming a professor, questions remain over whether \u2014 or to what extent \u2014 he was affected by the experiment, which reportedly involved mock interrogations in which participants\u2019 beliefs were harshly disparaged.Murray\u2019s study was widely reported to be part of a CIA program code-named Project MK-Ultra, inspired by the use of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea by the Soviet Union, China and North Korea. The program sought to understand how to control subjects\u2019 minds, sometimes using substances such as LSD, according to a document the CIA made publicly available in 2018. (There has not been evidence to suggest LSD or similar substances were used at Harvard on Kaczynski.)\u201cThe project attempted to produce a perfect truth drug for use in interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War,\u201d the document says. \u201cAnd generally to explore any other possibilities of mind control.\u201dCIA Director Richard Helms ordered the destruction of many files related to MK-Ultra in 1973. Nevertheless, Kaczynski disclosed some of his apparent involvement in the study in correspondence from prison with the professor Alston Chase, who later wrote a book about the Unabomber.Chase argued in a June 2000 article in the Atlantic magazine that Kaczynski\u2019s experiences at Harvard \u2014 his studies, overlapping with his roughly three-year participation in Murray\u2019s experiment \u2014 helped create the Unabomber.\u201cThus did Kaczynski\u2019s Harvard experiences shape his anger and legitimize his wrath,\u201d wrote Chase, who died in 2022. \u201cBy the time he graduated, all the elements that would ultimately transform him into the Unabomber were in place \u2026\u201dIn 1995, The Post weighed whether to print the Unabomber\u2019s manifestoWhile working for what was a precursor to the CIA, Murray conducted an experiment that put subjects under mock interrogations, with blinding spotlights and verbal abuse, Chase wrote, citing a report by the psychologist and his colleagues. The Harvard study also involved asking the participants to write essays explaining their worldviews, which were then picked apart by interrogators, according to the History Channel, which cited Murray\u2019s description of the sessions as \u201cvehement, sweeping, and personally abusive.\u201dHarvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the study.Though there has not been a definitive link between the study and Kaczynski\u2019s actions, which killed three people and injured 23 others, some have suggested that the program may have exacerbated his schizophrenia.\u201cThe Harvard experiment was stressful and stress aggravates the symptoms of schizophrenia,\u201d the psychologist Nigel Barber told History. \u201cOtherwise, it would be a mistake to exaggerate the importance of this experience, or to see it as a major determinant of his anti-science and anti-technology political views.\u201dYes, Trump could run for president from prison. This candidate did it in 1920.Others argued against placing too much importance on the influence of the study on Kaczynski. The sociologist Todd Gitlin wrote in a Washington Post review of Chase\u2019s book, \u201cHarvard and the Unabomber: The Education of an American Terrorist,\u201d that the \u201ceffect of Murray\u2019s dubious, unethical experiment on Kaczynski is unknown.\u201dWith many of the records regarding the study restricted or destroyed, and with questions about peculiar behavior in Kaczynski\u2019s childhood, it is unclear whether the study can be clearly tied to Kaczynski\u2019s transformation into a domestic terrorist, Gitlin wrote.In his manifesto \u2014 published by The Post in 1995 with the encouragement of federal officials \u2014 Kaczynski likened science to a \u201csurrogate activity\u201d that is \u201cdirected toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward\u201d or some sense of fulfillment.\u201cScientists work mainly for the fulfillment they get out of the work itself,\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2026 Thus science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the human race or to any other standard, obedient only to the psychological needs of the scientists and of the government officials and corporation executives who provide the funds for research.\u201d473CommentsGift ArticleMORE FROM RETROPOLISHAND CURATEDWhite supremacists attacked Johnny Cash for marrying a \u2018Negro\u2019 woman.

The experiments were part of a CIA-funded program known as MKUltra and were aimed at finding new ways to control human behavior. Participants were subjected to various techniques, including sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, and drug-induced hallucinations, in an attempt to break down their personalities. The story also contains discussion between commenters, who bring up the issue of personalized training in military basic training and share their own experiences. Some comments discuss the broader topic of government experimentation and the potential for such programs to run amok.The comments section diverges from the topic of China's handling of the pandemic to discuss American imperialism and atrocities committed by the US. Some argue that the US has allowed for a level of open public discussion of its wrongdoings not found in other major imperial powers. The discussion touches on topics such as torture, the Guantanamo Bay prison, and the invasion of Iraq. Sarcasm and whataboutism are present in some comments. Some commenters also provide historical context for the discussion. There is no new information or a specific release mentioned in the text.The comments in this forum discuss several topics, but the common thread is the questioning of widely held assumptions. The writers argue that specific biases influence scientific research funding, which in turn affects the relevance and effectiveness of scientific research. They also discuss the power of language to shape and guide our thinking. The discussion touches on the validity of conspiracy theories and the marketability of sensational ideas. However, there is no clear consensus on any of these topics.The post discusses conspiracy theories and the tendency of conspiracy theorists to move on to new, more far-fetched theories once one is debunked. Examples of popular conspiracy theories include the moon landing being faked and Jeffrey Epstein's death being a murder. However, the post argues that there is little scientific evidence to support most conspiracy theories and that actual conspiracies tend to be more mundane. A discussion about gun control and access to mental health care is also included, with some users arguing that psychiatric medications may contribute to mass shootings. Overall, the post emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and finding scientific evidence to support claims.The post includes discussions on mass shootings and psychological experiments run by the CIA, as well as theories on the factors behind school shootings in the US. The author of the post expresses skepticism about the possibility of the CIA using psychological experiments to create sleeper agents. The comments include discussions on the dangers of conspiracy theories and the role of media in influencing social behaviors. Additionally, the comments touch upon factors such as access to firearms, healthcare, and societal decay that may contribute to the frequency of school shootings in the US.The comments section revolves around the topic of MKULTRA and the possibility of it being connected to recent mass shootings. Some commenters are skeptical about the effectiveness of these mind control experiments, while others argue that the government has a history of manipulating individuals. A podcast recommendation on the subject is given. The article itself focuses on the potential involvement of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, in Murray's unethical experiment, but concludes that there is no known proof of this.No meaningful content to summarize.

    "content": "The Dutch government wants to automatically and administratively gain permission to target victims of hackersPosted onJun 07 2023This is a mirror of the original about:intel post, since the about:intel server is sadly overloaded.The Dutch government is proposing adding a lex specialis to its existing intelligence and security services act. This addition significantly changes the scope of many powers and also extends who they can be applied to.A draft of an English summary of this proposed law can be found here. A far longer summary in Dutch is here.On this page I\u2019d like to go over just one specific element of this new law: automatic extension of warrants to hacking victims (\u2019non-targets\u2019). Under the new law, the criteria for targeting non-targets actually become more lenient than for targeting actual targets. I would also hope to hear from experts on what the ECtHR might imply for this automatic extension and the newly proposed oversight. At the very end of this article you will find the original text of the articles, and my best stab at a translation.Current situationThe Dutch law (\u2019Wet op de inlichtingen \u2013 en veiligheidsdiensten 2017\u2019) has articles on special powers like targeted interception, bulk interception and hacking. In addition, there is a list of interests the services have to protect, and a list of intelligence they should be gathering. Crucially, the powers and the interests are not tied to each other directly.This means that the law makes it possible to perform targeted operations on organizations or people that are not themselves targets. One of the two oversight bodies (CTIVD, ex-post) has written in 2017 that such \u2019non-target\u2019 activities have to meet an elevated standard.Translated, this states (in two places):\u201cWhen hacking non-targets, a heightened proportionality test applies: there must be compelling operational interests that outweigh the importance of protecting fundamental rights and the interests of the non-target.\u201d\u201cThe use of special powers against a non-target is a serious measure that must be used very sparingly. An elevated proportionality test must be met. In order for the use to be proportional, the services must demonstrate that the interest in infringing upon the privacy of the non-target is so great that this infringement is justified. The privacy of the non-target is given extra weight, because as mentioned, the target does not itself provide a reason for investigation by the services. She or he is only a means to the actual target. To maintain balances, the interest that the services have in using special measures against the non-target must be greater than usual. If this is not the case, the scales are not balanced, and the application is not proportional and therefore not lawful. Situations where there are one or more concrete indications of a direct threat to national security can be considered as compelling operational interests.\u201dCurrently, the independent ex-ante regulator (TIB) reviews the lawfulness of hacking and interception requests/warrants. The conclusion of this review is binding. This mode of operation corresponds to the ECHR/ECtHR standard for independent authorization (Convention 108+ Article 11(3)).New situation: automatic extensionIn the new situation, hacking, targeted interception and data access operations get an automatic extension beyond the actual target of the warrant. If a warrant is requested to intercept the communications of a specific hacking organization, the warrant now also extends to victims of this hacking group. Or, more concretely, if your computer gets hacked by group X and there was a warrant to intercept the traffic of group X, the Dutch services now gain automatic approval to also intercept your communications or hack you.In the law is it worded that any automated works \u2019taken into use\u2019 by the original targeted organization are also automatically in scope of the warrant.Enlarging the warrant in this way is an administrative addition which involves no further approval process, not internally, nor externally. This in contrast to the original warrant which had to go past internal review, the head of service and the minister.The ex-post regulator (CTIVD), however, does get notified of such an administrative addition. The CTIVD can optionally launch an investigation to find if it agreed with this addition. If it disagrees, it can inform the minister and the Dutch parliament, and demand that the operation be halted. The services can also appeal this demand with one of the many Dutch supreme courts, and this court (the Council of State) can stay the order if so requested. This is a complicated procedure which is very different than ex-ante authorization.Some initial analysisThere is a tension in these new powers. A warrant on \u2018organization X\u2019 may now administratively also be enlarged to target internet subscriptions or devices from entirely unrelated people. This creates the fiction that organization X now extends to random other people.In addition, whereas previously there was an elevated standard for applying powers to non-targets, there is now actually a vastly reduced standard compared to actual targets. The ex-ante regulator TIB will need to be convinced that it is proportional to target organization X. However, any non-targets now no longer benefit from an elevated standard. The non-targets in fact benefit from no standards at all anymore.It appears that Dutch legislators are laboring under the assumption that they can apply powers to the non-target, but are actually targeting organization X alone. The warrants however directly impact all communications or the entire device, and not just the parts used by organization X.Implications for Article 8 ECHRI would be very interested in hearing thoughts from experts on how Article 8 ECHR bears on all this. Specifically, is the administrative addition of non-targets, with only the possibility of a binding but very heavy handed review afterwards, in line with recent jurisprudence? And perhaps this might differ for the three specific powers, targeted interception, hacking and requesting a copy of all stored customer data. This last article can be used to retrieve the contents from any servers or computers.Original textDutch laws come with a large \u2019explanatory memorandum\u2019, which while not actually part of the law, is taken very seriously by courts, to the point that any understanding of the law must involve reading this memorandum. The memorandum can significantly alter the interpretation of a law.Article 5, sixth member:\u201cIn aanvulling op het bepaalde in artikel 45, achtste lid, van de Wiv 2017, omvat de verleende toestemming tevens de bevoegdheid om, voor de duur van de verleende toestemming, binnen te dringen in een ander geautomatiseerd werk dat door de desbetreffende persoon of organisatie in gebruik is voor zover dat in de plaats treedt van of een aanvulling is op het geautomatiseerde werk waar oorspronkelijk de toestemming voor is verleend\u201dOr:\u201cIn addition to article 45, eighth member of the Wiv 2017, the permission granted also contains authorization for, during the validity of the warrant, to also enter automated works of the person or organization targeted by the warrant, in so far as this new automated work is in addition to or replacement of an automated work the original authorization applied to.\u201dAn \u2018automated work\u2019 in this specific Dutch law has an extremely broad interpretation and includes such things as phones, computers, servers, websites, databases and mailboxes.",

    "content": "Mental LiquidityMAR 29, 2023SHARE \u2193by Morgan Housel@morganhouselI recently heard a phrase I love: Mental liquidity. It\u2019s the ability to quickly abandon previous beliefs when the world changes or when you come across new information.It shouldn\u2019t be controversial. But mental liquidity is so rare. Changing your mind is hard because it\u2019s easier to fool yourself into believing a falsehood than admit a mistake.Albert Einstein hated the idea of quantum physics.His own brand of physics was an extension of classic Newtonian physics, which viewed the universe as working in clean, rational, ways that could be measured with precision. Then quantum theory came along with the wild idea that some parts of the physical world could not be measured, because the very act of measuring a subatomic particle changed its movement. The best we could do when trying to measure parts of the world was to come up with probabilities and likelihoods.That was practically heresy to Einstein, who let his quantum theory peers know how he felt.\u201cOne cannot make a theory out of a lot of \u2018maybes,\u2019\u201d he once told a group of physicists in 1927. God, he said, \u201cdoes not play dice.\u201dEven when he remained professional about his misgivings, Einstein stood firm. \u201cI admire to the highest degree the achievements of the younger generation of physicists that goes by the name quantum mechanics,\u201d he once told an interviewer, \u201cBut I believe that the restriction to statistical laws will be a passing one.\u201dHis peers were disappointed. \u201cEinstein, I\u2019m ashamed of you,\u201d said quantum physicist Paul Ehrenfest, who felt the great physicist was being as stubborn as those who once doubted Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity.Within five years, a group of quantum physicists would win the Nobel Prize, solidifying their contributions and validating quantum theory.Left unmentioned during the award ceremony was that the group was nominated by Einstein himself.\u201cI am convinced that this [quantum] theory undoubtedly contains a part of the ultimate truth,\u201d he wrote in his nomination.He had come around.So much of what people call \u201cconviction\u201d is actually a willful disregard for facts that might change their minds. It\u2019s dangerous because conviction feels like a good attribute, while its opposite \u2013 being wishy-washy \u2013 makes you feel and sound like an idiot.There\u2019s this thing in psychology called the end of history illusion, which is the idea that people are aware of how much their personality has changed in the past, but they assume it will be stable in the future. I laugh at who I was at age 20, but I assume that by age 60 I\u2019ll roughly be the same person I am today. Part of the reason it occurs is because it\u2019s too painful to accept that the beliefs I hold today might be wrong, temporary, or subjective.Beliefs take effort and investment, and it hurts to realize that there may be limited ROI on your hard-fought convictions. For a lot of things in life \u2013 particularly politics, investing, and relationships \u2013 people don\u2019t necessarily want the truth; they want certainty. Changing your mind is hard because it\u2019s an admission that the certainty you once thought you held was an illusion. The path of least resistance is to cling to beliefs for dear life.A question I love to ask people is, \u201cWhat have you changed your mind about in the last decade?\u201d I use \u201cdecade\u201d because it pushes you into thinking about big things, not who you think will win the Super Bowl.I am always so suspicious of people who say, \u201cnothing.\u201d They act like it\u2019s a sign of intelligence \u2013 that their beliefs are so accurate that they couldn\u2019t possibly need to change. But I think it\u2019s the surest sign of ignorance and stubbornness.Visa founder Dee Hock had a great saying: \u201cA belief is not dangerous until it turns absolute.\u201d That\u2019s when you start ignoring information that might require you to update your beliefs. It might sound crazy, but I think a good rule of thumb is that your strongest convictions have the highest chance of being wrong or incomplete, if only because they are the hardest beliefs to challenge, update, and abandon when necessary.Two critical things to keep in mind here:Be careful what beliefs you let become part of your identity. Religion and politics are contentious because almost by definition your beliefs are part of your identity \u2013 you\u2019re not just dealing with ideas and philosophies, but tribes and belonging. Another Dee Hock quote applies here: \u201cWe are built with an almost infinite capacity to believe things because the beliefs are advantageous for us to hold, rather than because they are even remotely related to the truth.\u201d Things get dangerous when people let their investing and economic beliefs fall into the same category.Most fields have lots of rules, theories, ideas, and hunches. But laws \u2013 things that are unimpeachable and cannot ever change \u2013 are extremely rare. Some fields only have a handful. A big problem arises when you try to force rules and theories to become laws. The few laws tend to be the most important things in any field. But everything else, like Einstein said, is just a theory of maybes.SHARESign up for more Collab Fund content",

The article references Dee Hock's quote, \"A belief is not dangerous until it turns absolute.\" The author emphasizes the need for intellectual integrity and encourages readers to ask themselves what they have changed their mind about in the last decade. Various commenters provide additional insights and references to related concepts such as value rigidity and self-authorship.The conversation on an online forum discusses mental flexibility, the ability to change beliefs and ideas. The community shares various perspectives and experiences, including the importance of cognitive flexibility, not being emotionally attached to ideas, and avoiding sunk cost fallacy. Participants also suggest cultivating humility, not letting beliefs become part of identity, and being willing to change. One user recommends debating and exploring issues from multiple perspectives, while another advises avoiding becoming too rigid in thinking. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the value of openness and adaptability in various contexts, including personal growth, scientific inquiry, and building a successful startup culture.",

Not if we value our time or our storage space. I regret to inform you that Mike Brixius, on his RavenWolf Retro Tech channel, offers just such a story about his quest to finish his own Commodore 64 CRPG from 1984. He will be able to do it, too, because he kept all the disks, tapes, notes, and hand-documented assembly code print-outs ever since his teenage project.\"It's one of those loose threads in my life that I deeply regret,\" Brixius says in his video. He hopes his Patreon supporters and YouTube community can give him the \"moral support and accountability\" he needs to complete his game after all these years.RavenWolf Retro Tech's video, launching his campaign to restore his 1984 C64 CRPG, Digital Dungeon Master (DDM), to its proper glory.Digital Dungeon Master (DDM) was based partly on the Avalon Hill tabletop games Brixius loved at the time, but more so on Avalon Hill's foray into dungeon-crawling RPGs, Telengard. Brixius wanted to re-create Telengard's limited line of sight but add in a surface world, akin to that of another favorite of his, Ultima IV.EnlargeBrixius was working without an assembler back then, something he deeply regrets. He does not, however, regret his pack-rat tendencies, which have left him with these pieces to pull together:Executable machine code, mostly from May 1985, but some from as late as 1989, with hand-written notes on itA printed-out memory dump of all 4K of RAM from the game at some pointCassettes and disks, some of which load, but none with an uncorrupted game runningListings of the code from 1986, used to test machine language routinesExtensive handwritten and drawn notes, maps, and other explanations of the game's design.So far, Brixius has, by hand-typing in his old code, gotten a facsimile of a simple overworld and dungeon working. He has already figured out one memory-saving fix, setting a single bit to define each wall space (wall, open door, closed door, secret door) rather than the two-bit system he originally devised. The game takes up 12K of RAM, split roughly evenly between code and data. Brixius figures his dungeons can be about 64\u00d764 squares before he hits the C64's limits.Enlarge / A hand-drawn map that Brixius is relying on to help him finish his C64-era CRPG.YouTube/RavenWolf Retro TechPatrons and YouTube followers can help Brixius decide which projects and game aspects to tackle next in each of his planned quarterly sprints. At the moment, he has\u2014with nearly 40 years' hindsight\u2014decided to make source control his first priority, followed by completing his map code and fixing the color scheme in dungeons. He cautions that he intends to keep the project true to its early days CRPG roots; it \"won't be as elaborate as something like The Bard's Tale.\"We first saw Brixius' quest at Hackaday, and we'll keep an eye on his progress. He plans to finish it by 2024, but let's all cut him some slack on that.READER COMMENTS106WITHKEVIN PURDYKevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a variety of technology topics and reviewing products.
