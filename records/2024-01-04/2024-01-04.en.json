In 1968, the Communications of the ACM published a text of mine under the title \"The goto statement considered harmful\", which in later years would be most frequently referenced, regrettably, however, often by authors who had seen no more of it than its title, which became a cornerstone of my fame by becoming a template: we would see all sorts of articles under the title \"X considered harmful\" for almost any X, including one titled \"Dijkstra considered harmful\". But what had happened? I had submitted a paper under the title \"A case against the goto statement\", which, in order to speed up its publication, the editor had changed into a \"letter to the Editor\", and in the process he had given it a new title of his own invention! The editor was Niklaus Wirth.It is refreshing to see the old-fashioned trope of the genius computer scientist &#x2F; software enginieer as a \"foreigner to the world\" being contested again and again by stories like this.Of course people like Niklaus Wirth are exceptional in many ways, so it might be that the trope has&#x2F;had some grain of truth, that just does not co-correlate with the success of said person :)And of course people might want to argue about the differences betweem SE, CS and economics.After all that rambling...

So the ref., probably. reply lukego 14 hours agoprevBesides all his innumerable accomplishments he was also a hero to Joe Armstrong and a big influence on his brand of simplicity.Joe would often quote Wirth as saying that yes, overlapping windows might be better than tiled ones, but not better enough to justify their cost in implementation complexity.RIP. He is also a hero for me for his 80th birthday symposium at ETH where he showed off his new port of Oberon to a homebrew CPU running on a random FPGA dev board with USB peropherals. My ambition is to be that kind of 80 year old one day, too. reply cscheid 13 hours agoparent> not _better enough_Wirth was such a legend on this particular aspect. His stance on compiler optimizations is another example: only add optimization passes if they improve the compiler&#x27;s self-compilation time.Oberon also, (and also deliberately) only supported cooperative multitasking. reply superluserdo 13 hours agorootparent>His stance on compiler optimizations is another example: only add optimization passes if they improve the compiler&#x27;s self-compilation time.What an elegant metric! Condensing a multivariate optimisation between compiler execution speed and compiler codebase complexity into a single self-contained meta-metric is (aptly) pleasingly simple.I&#x27;d be interested to know how the self-build times of other compilers have changed by release (obviously pretty safe to say, generally increasing). reply amelius 13 hours agorootparentHmm, but what if the compiler doesn&#x27;t use the optimized constructs, e.g. floating point optimizations targeting numerical algorithms? reply bunderbunder 12 hours agorootparentLife was different in the &#x27;80s. Oberon targeted the NS32000, which didn&#x27;t have a floating point unit. Let alone most the other modern niceties that could lead to a large difference between CPU features used by the compiler itself, and CPU features used by other programs written using the compiler.That said, even if the exact heuristic Wirth used is no longer tenable, there&#x27;s still a lot of wisdom in the pragmatic way of thinking that inspired it. reply whartung 6 hours agorootparentSpeaking of that, if you were ever curious how computers do floating point math, I think the first Oberon book explains it in a couple of pages. It’s very succinct and, for me, one of the clearest explanations I’ve found. reply samus 4 hours agorootparentprevRewrite the compiler to use a LLM for complication. I&#x27;m only half joking! The biggest remaining technical problem is the context length, which is severely limiting the input size right now. Also, the required humongous model size. reply hoosieree 10 hours agorootparentprevSimple fix: floating-point indexes to all your tries. Or switch to base π or increment every counter by e. reply Someone 9 hours agorootparentThat’s not a simple fix in this context. Try making it without slowing down the compiler.You could try to game the system by combining such a change that slows down compilation with one that compensates for it, though, but I think code reviewers of the time wouldn’t accept that. reply kragen 13 hours agorootparentprevprobably use a fortran compiler for that instead of oberon reply thesz 12 hours agorootparentprevYou cannot add a loop skew optimization to compiler before compiler needs a loop skew optimization. Which it would not need at all because it is loop skew optimization (it requires matrix operations) that need a loop skew optimization.In short, compiler is not an ideal representation of the user programs it needs to optimize. reply WJW 12 hours agorootparentPerhaps Wirth would say that compilers are _close enough_ to user programs to be a decent enough representation in most cases. And of course he was sensible enough to also recognize that there are special cases, like matrix operations, where it might be wirthwhile.EDIT: typo in the last word but I&#x27;m leaving it in for obvious reasons. reply Someone 9 hours agorootparentprevWirth ran an OS research lab. For that, the compiler likely is a fairly typical workload.But yes, it wouldn’t work well in a general context. For example, auto-vectorization likely doesn’t speed up a compiler much at all, while adding the code to detect where it’s possible will slow it down.So, that feature never can be added.On the other hand, may lead to better designs. If, instead, you add language features that make it easier for programmers to write vectorized code, that might end up being easier for programmers. They would have to write more code, but they also would have to guess less whether their code would end up being vectorized. reply kragen 7 hours agorootparentperhaps you could write the compiler using the data structures used by co-dfns (which i still don&#x27;t understand) so that vectorization would speed it up, auto- or otherwise reply frognumber 13 hours agorootparentprevSupported cooperative multitasking won in the end.It just renamed itself to asynchronous programing. That&#x27;s quite literally what an &#x27;await&#x27; is. reply jerf 12 hours agorootparentIt hasn&#x27;t won. Threads are alive and well and I rather expect async has probably already peaked and is back on track to be a niche that stays with us forever, but a niche nevertheless.Your opinion vs. my opinion, obviously. But the user reports of the experience in Rust is hardly even close to unanimous praise and I still say it&#x27;s a mistake to sit down with an empty Rust program and immediately reach for \"async\" without considering whether you actually need it. Even in the network world, juggling hundreds of thousands of simultaneous tasks is the exception rather than the rule.Moreover, cooperative multitasking was given up at the OS level for good and sufficient reasons that I see no evidence that the current thrust in that direction has solved. As you scale up, the odds of something jamming your cooperative loop monotonically increase. At best we&#x27;ve increased the scaling factors, and even that just may be an effect of faster computers rather than better solutions. reply kragen 7 hours agorootparentin the 02000s there was a lot of interest in software transactional memory as a programming interface that gives you the latency and throughput of preemptive multithreading with locks but the convenient programming interface of cooperative multitasking; in haskell it&#x27;s still supported and performs well, but it has been largely abandoned in contexts like c#, because it kind of wants to own the whole world. it&#x27;s difficult to add incrementally to a threads-and-locks programi suspect that this will end up being the paradigm that wins out, even though it isn&#x27;t popular today reply senderista 5 hours agorootparentI was considering making a startup out of my simple C++ STM[0], but the fact that, as you point out, the transactional paradigm is viral and can&#x27;t be added incrementally to existing lock-based programs was enough to dissuade me.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senderista.github.io&#x2F;atomik-website&#x2F; reply LispSporks22 2 hours agorootparentSound’s nifty. Did this take advantage of those Intel (maybe others?) STM opcodes?

After the company folded I worked on it on my own time for a couple months, implementing some perf ideas I had never had time to work on, and when update transactions wereI ask because I&#x27;ve found `async&#x2F;await` to just be an irritating overheadThen what you want are coroutines[1], which are strictly more flexible than async&#x2F;await. Languages like Lua and Squirrel have coroutines. I and plenty of other people thing it&#x27;s tragic that Python and Javascripts added async&#x2F;await instead, but I assume the reason wasn&#x27;t to make them easier to reason about, but rather to make them easier to implement without hacks in existing language interpreters not designed around them. Though Stackless Python is a CPython fork that adds real coroutines, also available as the greenlet module in standard CPython [2], amazing that it works.[1] Real coroutines, not what Python calls \"coroutines with async syntax\".

There shouldn&#x27;t be one.in the other direction, tymshare and key logic&#x27;s operating system &#x27;keykos&#x27; was largely designed, norm hardy said, with concepts from sigplan, the acm sig on programming languages, rather than sigsospsometimes irritating overhead hoops you need to jump through have the advantage of making your code easier to debug later. this is (i would argue, munificent would disagree) one of those times, and i&#x27;ll explain the argument why belowin `var foo = await my_function()` usually if my_function is async that&#x27;s because it can&#x27;t compute foo immediately; the reasons in the examples in the tutorial you linked are making web requests (where you don&#x27;t know the response code until the remote server sends it) and reading data from files (where you may have to wait on a disk or a networked fileserver). if all your functions are synchronous, you don&#x27;t have threads, and you can&#x27;t afford to tie up your entire program (or computer) waiting on the result, you have to do something like changing my_function to return a promise, and putting the code below the line `var foo = await my_function()` into a separate subroutine, probably a nested closure, which you pass to the promise&#x27;s `then` method. this means you can&#x27;t use structured control flow like statement sequencing and while loops to go through a series of such steps, the way you can with threads or asyncso what if you use threads? the example you linked says to use threads! i think it&#x27;s a widely accepted opinion now (though certainly not universal) that shared-mutable-memory threading is the wrong default, because race conditions in multithreaded programs with implicitly shared mutable memory are hard to detect and prevent, and also hard to debug. you need some kind of synchronization between the threads, and if you use semaphores or locks like most people do, you also get deadlocks, which are hard to prevent or statically detect but easy to debug once they happenasync&#x2F;await guarantees you won&#x27;t have deadlocks (because you don&#x27;t have locks) and also makes race conditions much rarer and relatively easy to detect and prevent. mark s. miller, one of the main designers of recent versions of ecmascript, wrote his doctoral dissertation largely about this in 02006 http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erights.org&#x2F;talks&#x2F;thesis&#x2F;index.html after several years working on an earlier programming language called e based on promises like the ones he later added to js; but i have to admit that, while i&#x27;ve read a lot of his previous work, i haven&#x27;t read his dissertation yetcooperative multitasking is in an in-between place; it often doesn&#x27;t use locks and makes race conditions somewhat rarer and easier to detect and prevent than preemptive multitasking, because most functions you call are guaranteed not to yield control to another thread. you just have to remember which ones those are, and sometimes it changes even though your code didn&#x27;t change(in oberon, at least the versions i&#x27;ve read about, there was no way to yield control. you just had to finish executing and return, like in js in a web page before web workers, as i think i said upthread)that&#x27;s why i think it&#x27;s better to have colored functions even though it sometimes requires annoying hoop-jumping reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparent> async&#x2F;await guarantees you won&#x27;t have deadlocksYou will get them in .NET and C++, because they map to real threads being shared across tasks.There is even a FAQ maintained by .NET team regarding gotchas like not calling ConfigureAwaitable with the right thread context in some cases where it needs to be explicitly configured, like a task moving between foreground and background threads. reply nottorp 12 hours agorootparentprevAnd these fancy new names aren&#x27;t there just for hiding the event loop? :) reply frognumber 11 hours agorootparentSort of and sort of not.The key thing about 2023-era asynchronous versus 1995-era cooperative multitasking is code readability and conciseness.Under the hood, I&#x27;m expressing the same thing, but Windows 3.1 code was not fun to write. Python &#x2F; JavaScript, once you wrap your head around it, is. The new semantics are very readable, and rapidly improving too. The old ones were impossible to make readable.You could argue that it&#x27;s just syntactic sugar, but it&#x27;s bloody important syntactic sugar. reply bjoli 2 hours agorootparentI never left 1991 and I haven&#x27;t seen anything that has made me consider leaving ConcurrentML except for the actor model, but that is so old the documentation is written on parchment. reply hathawsh 8 hours agorootparentprevExactly. The way I think about it, the \"async\" keyword transforms function code so that local variables are no longer bound to the stack, making it possible to pause function execution (using \"await\") and resume it at an arbitrary time. Performing that transformation manually is a fair amount of work and it&#x27;s prone to errors, but that&#x27;s what we did when we wrote cooperatively multitasked code. reply wglb 6 hours agorootparentprevCoroutines are better than both. Particularly in reasoning about code. reply kragen 12 hours agorootparentprevif the implied contrast is with cooperative multitasking, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite: they&#x27;re there to expose the event loop in a way you can&#x27;t ignore. if the implied contrast is with setTimeout(() => { ... }, 0) then yes, pretty much, although the difference is fairly small—implicit variable capture by the closure does most of the same hiding that await does reply nottorp 12 hours agorootparentNot asking about old JavaScript vs new JavaScript. Asking about explicit event loop vs hidden event loop with fancy names like timeout, async, await... reply kragen 12 hours agorootparentdo you mean the kind of explicit loop where you write for (;;) { int r = GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0); if (!r) break; if (r == -1) croak(); TranslateMessage(&msg); DispatchMessage(&msg); }or, in yeso, for (;;) { yw_wait(w, 0); for (yw_event *ev; (ev = yw_get_event(w));) handle_event(ev); redraw(w); }async&#x2F;await doesn&#x27;t always hide the event loop in that sense; python asyncio, for example, has a lot of ways to invoke the event loop or parts of it explicitly, which is often necessary for integration with software not written with asyncio in mind. i used to maintain an asyncio cubesat csp protocol stack where we had to do thisto some extent, though, this vitiates the concurrency guarantees you can otherwise get out of async&#x2F;await. software maintainability comes from knowing that certain things are impossible, and pure async&#x2F;await can make concurrency guarantees which disappear when a non-async function can invoke the event loop in this way. so i would argue that it goes further than just hiding the event loop. it&#x27;s like saying that garbage collection is about hiding memory addresses: sort of true, but false in an important sense reply nottorp 11 hours agorootparentWhat worries me is we may have a whole generation who doesn&#x27;t know about the code you posted above and thinks it&#x27;s magic or worse, real multiprocessing. reply kragen 10 hours agorootparentokay but is that what you meant by &#x27;hiding the event loop&#x27; or did you mean something different replysmartscience 13 hours agorootparentprevI always knew my experience with RISC OS wouldn&#x27;t go to waste! reply vram22 13 hours agorootparentprev>Supported cooperative multitasking won in the end.Is this the same as coroutines as in Knuth&#x27;s TAOCP volume 1?Sorry, my knowledge is weak in this area. reply kragen 12 hours agorootparentnot exactly; see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cooperative_multitasking reply vram22 12 hours agorootparentThanks, will check that. reply steveklabnik 10 hours agorootparentThe quick answer is that coroutines are often used to implement cooperative multitasking because it is a very natural fit, but it&#x27;s a more general idea than that specific implementation strategy. reply kragen 10 hours agorootparentinteresting, i would have said the relationship is the other way around: cooperative multitasking implies that you have separate stacks that you&#x27;re switching between, and coroutines are a more general idea which includes cooperative multitasking (as in lua) and things that aren&#x27;t cooperative multitasking (as in rust and python) because the program&#x27;s execution state isn&#x27;t divided into distinct tasksi could just be wrong tho reply steveklabnik 10 hours agorootparentYeah thinking about it more I didn’t intend to imply a subset relationship. Coroutines are not only used to implement cooperative multitasking, for sure. replypjmlp 1 hour agorootparentprevNote that Oberon descendents like Active Oberon and Zonnon, do have premptive multitasking. reply kristianp 6 hours agorootparentprevIn the past, this policy of Wirth&#x27;s has been cited when talking about go compiler development.Go team member, Robert Griesemer, did his Phd under Mössenböck and Wirth. reply steveklabnik 11 hours agorootparentprevDo you happen to remember where he said that?

He was one of the people that made me from a teenager that hacked on his keyboard to get something to run to a seasoned programmer that thinks before he codes.Even before I met him at the university I was programming in Oberon because there was a big crowd of programmers doing Wirth languages on the Amiga.He will be missed. reply microtherion 9 hours agoparentI&#x27;m also a student of his, and later met him socially on a few occasions as a graduate student (in a different institute).Undergraduate students were all in awe of him, but I got the impression that he did not particularly enjoy teaching them (Unlike other professors, however, he did not try to delegate that part of his responsibilities to his assistants). He seemed to have a good relationship with his graduate students.In his class on compiler construction, he seemed more engaged (the students were already a bit more experienced, and he was iterating the Oberon design at the time). I remember an exchange we had at the oral exam — he asked me to solve the \"dangling ELSE\" problem in Pascal. I proposed resolving the ambiguity through a refinement of the language grammar. He admitted that this would probably work, but thought it excessively complex and wondered where I got that idea, since he definitely had not taught it, so I confessed that I had seen the idea in the \"Dragon Book\" (sort of the competition to his own textbook). Ultimately, I realized that he just wanted me to change the language to require an explicit END, as he had done in Modula-2 and Oberon.Socially, he was fun to talk to, had a great store of computer lore, of course. He was also much more tolerant of \"heresies\" in private than in public, where he came across as somewhat dogmatic. Once, the conversation turned to Perl, which I did not expect him to have anything good to say about. To my surprise, he thought that there was a valid niche for pattern matching &#x2F; text processing languages (mentioning SNOBOL as an earlier language in this niche). reply pjmlp 1 hour agoparentprevYes, the Amiga was one of the platforms where Modula-2 had quite a crowd, more so than on the PC, as we got spoiled with Turbo Pascal instead. reply sterlind 12 hours agoparentprevwhich languages?

In fact, Devine&#x27;s own presentation[0] about uxn specifically cites Wirth and Oberon, among countless other inspirations and examples. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s awesome, accessible, simple and open.I don&#x27;t need to \"develop more tolerance for differing opinions\" - I have no problem with them and am completely open to them, even from people who I feel are communicating in an unfriendly, patronizing or gatekeeping manner. rollcat shared some other people and projects and you took it upon yourself to shoot down as much as possible in that comment - for what purpose? No one said Drecker is \"on Wirth&#x27;s level\" when it comes to programming. We don&#x27;t need him to write FizzBuzz, let alone any other software. I&#x27;m sorry you don&#x27;t recognize the value of a publication like Low-Tech Magazine, but the rest of us can, and your need to shoot down that recognition is why I called your messages persistently negative.Further, when I give kudos to uxn and recognize it as a cool piece of software, there&#x27;s absolutely no point in coming in and saying \"yeah but it&#x27;s no big deal compared to ____\" , as if anyone was interested in some kind of software achievement pissing contest. The sanctity and reverence for your software idols is not diluted nor detracted from by acknowledging, recognizing and celebrating newer contributors to the world of computing and software.I have to come back and edit this and just reiterate: All I originally said was \"uxn ftw\" and you found it necessary to \"put me in my place\" about something I didn&#x27;t even say&#x2F;assert, and make it into some kind of competition or gatekeeping situation.

(you could argue that this is a simplicity thing; lua 5.2 is under 15000 lines of code, which is pretty small for such a full-featured language, barely bigger than original-awk at 6200 lines of c and yacc plus 1500 lines of awk, and smaller than mawk at 16000 lines of c, 1100 lines of yacc, and 700 lines of awk. but a recursive table print function with a depth limit is about 25 lines of code.)none of these are fatal flaws, but with the benefit of experience they all seem like clear mistakes replynerpderp82 13 hours agoparentprevAs far as I know, Henry Baker is still with us.

I&#x27;m also aware that I can read and understand a whole lot of pages of code in the amount of time it takes me to decipher a few lines of K for example, and the less dense codes sticks far better in my head.I appreciate brevity, but I feel there&#x27;s a fundamental disconnect between people who want to carefully read code symbol by symbol, who often seem to love languages like J or K, or at least he better able to fully appreciate them, and people like me who want to skim code and look at the shape of it (literally; I remember code best by its layout and often navigate code by appearance without reading it at all, and so dense dumps of symbols are a nightmare to me)I sometimes think it reflects a difference between people who prefer maths vs languages. I&#x27;m not suggesting one is better than the other, but I do believe the former is a smaller group than the latter.For my part I want grammar that makes for a light, casual read, not having to decipher. I want to be able to get a rough understanding with a glance, and gradually fill in details, not read things start to finish (yes, I&#x27;m impatient)A favourite example of mije is the infamous J interpreter fragment, where I&#x27;d frankly be inclined to prefer a disassembly over the source code. But I also find the ability to sketch out such compact code amazing.I think Wirths designs very much fit in the languages that are skimmable and recognisable by shape and structure category. I can remember parts of several of Wirths students PhD theses from the 1990s by the shape of procedures in their Oberon code to this day.That&#x27;s not to diminish Whitney&#x27;s work, and I find that disconnect in how we process code endlessly fascinating, and regularly look at languages in that family because there is absolutely a lot to learn from them, but they fit very different personalities and learning styles. reply chongli 2 hours agorootparentI sometimes think it reflects a difference between people who prefer maths vs languages. I&#x27;m not suggesting one is better than the other, but I do believe the former is a smaller group than the latter.This dichotomy exists in mathematics as well. Some mathematicians prefer to flood the page with symbols. Others prefer to use English words as much as possible and sprinkle equations here and there (on their own line) between paragraphs of text.The worst are those that love symbols and paragraphs, writing these dense walls of symbols and text intermixed.

In your case, my Numpy is rusty, but I think this is the Ruby equivalent of what you were doing? textb = &#x27;What hath the Flying Spaghetti Monster wrought?&#x27; p textb.bytes.product((0...8).to_a).map{_1>>_2}.map{_1 & 1}Or with some abominable monkey patching: class Array def outer(r) = product(r.to_a) def right_shift = map{_1>>_2} end p textb.bytes.outer(0...8).right_shift.map{_1 & 1}I think this latter is likely to be a closer match to what you&#x27;d expect in an array language in terms of being able to read in a single direction and having a richer set of operations. We could take it one step further and break the built in Array#&: class Array def &(r) = map{_1 & r} end p textb.bytes.outer(0...8).right_shift & 1Which is to say that I don&#x27;t think the operator-style line-noise nature of K is what gives it its power. Rather that it has a standard library that is fashioned around this specific set of array operations. With Ruby at least, I think you can bend it towards the same Array nature-ish. E.g. a step up from the above that at least contains the operator overloading and instead coerces into a custom class: textb = &#x27;What hath the Flying Spaghetti Monster wrought?&#x27; class Object def k = KArray[*self.to_a] end class String def k = bytes.k end class KArray >_2}.k def &(r) = map{_1 & r}.k end p textb.k.outer(0...8).right_shift & 1With some care, I think you could probably replicate a fair amount of K&#x27;s \"verbs\" and \"adverbs\" (I so hate their naming) in a way that&#x27;d still be very concise but not line-noise concise. reply kragen 2 hours agorootparentthat all seems correct; the issue i had was not that python is less flexible than ruby (though it is!) but that it required a lot of mental effort to map back from the set of point-free array operations to my original intent. this makes me think that my trouble with j and k is not the syntax at all. but conceivably if i study the apl idiom list or something i could get better at that kind of thinking? reply vidarh 1 hour agorootparentI think you could twist Python into getting something similarly concise one way or other ;) It might not be the Python way, though. I agree it often is painful to map. I think in particular the issue for me is visualizing the effects once you&#x27;re working with a multi-dimensional set of arrays. E.g. I know what outer&#x2F;product does logically, but I have to think through the effects in a way I don&#x27;t need to do with a straightforward linear map(). I think I&#x27;d have been more likely to have ended up with something like this if I started from scratch even if it&#x27;s not as elegant. p textb.bytes.map{|b| (0...8).map{|i| (b>>i) & 1} }.flattenEDIT: This is kind of embarrassing, but we can of course do just this: textb.bytes.flat_map{_1.digits(2)}But I think the general discussion still applies, and it&#x27;s quite interesting how many twists and turns it took to arrive at that replykragen 7 hours agorootparentprevwell, simplicity anyway, arguably (like moore) to an even higher degree than wirth reply tahnyall 12 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s OK on Hacker News to dis a reputable news source now? reply omoikane 14 hours agoprevNiklaus Wirth was also responsible for changing the title of Dijkstra&#x27;s paper to \"Goto Statement Considered Harmful\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Considered_harmful#cite_ref-6 reply tommsy64 13 hours agoparentRelevant excerpt of Dijkstra&#x27;s own account (from EWD1308 [1]):Finally a short story for the record.

He was a titan of computing and still deserved even more attention that the got. If his languages had been more prevalent in software development, a lot of things would be in a better shape.After playing around a bit with Basic on the C64&#x2F;128, Pascal became my first \"real\" programming language I learned. In the form of UCSD Pascal on Apple II at my school as well as Turbo Pascal 3.0 on a IBM PC (no AT or any fanciness yet). Actually a Portable PC with a build-in amber CRT.When I got my Amiga 500, Modula 2 was a very popular language on the Amiga and actually the M2Amiga system was the most robust dev env. I still think fondly of that time, as Modula 2 made it so easy to develop structured and robust programs. The module concept was quite ahead of the time, while the C world kept recompiling header files for so many years to come. Today, Go picked up a lot from Modula 2, one reason I immediately jumped onto it. Not by chance, Robert Griesemer was a student of Wirth.During the 90ies, while MS Dos was still used, Turbo Pascal still was the main go-to language on the PC for everyone, as it was powerful, yet approachable for non-fulltime software developers. It picked up a lot of extensions from Modula 2 too and also had a nice Object system. It peaked at the version 6 and 7. Probably to the day my favorite development environment, partially because of the unmatched speed of a pure character based UI. And Turbo Pascal combined the nice development environment with a language which found a great compromise between power and simplicity.Unfortunately, I was only vaguely familiar with his later work on Oberon. I ran the Oberon system natively on my 386 for some toying around. It was extremely impressive with its efficiency and full GUI in the time of DOS on the PC. A pity, it didn&#x27;t achive more attention. Probably it would have been very successful if it had gained tracking in the not too late 80ies, in the early 90ies of course Windows came along.From a puristic point of view, the crowning achievement was of course when he really earned the job title of a \"full stack developer\", not only designing Oberon and the OS, but the CPU to run it as well. Very impressive and of a huge educational value.END. reply raphlinus 13 hours agoprevProf Wirth was a major inspiration for me as a kid.

In the 1980s this may have been considered overly costly (and perhaps it is considered so today as well), but the alternative that the computing field and industry picked was C, where unbounded arrays and strings were a common source of buffer overflow errors. Cleaning this up has taken decades and we still probably aren&#x27;t done.Better C&#x2F;C++ compilers and libraries can help, but the original C language and standard library were certainly part of the issue.

A glassy memory effect is found during cooling. Typical hysteresis loops for superconductors are detected below 250 K, along with an asymmetry between forward and backward sweep of magnetic field. Our experiment suggests at room temperature the Meissner effect is possibly present in this material.

    "commentBody": "Possible Meissner effect near room temperature: copper-substituted lead apatiteHacker NewspastloginPossible Meissner effect near room temperature: copper-substituted lead apatite (arxiv.org) 675 points by zaikunzhang 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite286 comments sanxiyn 19 hours agoSome background: there were two Chinese teams publicly pursuing LK-99-derived room temperature superconductor, which I arbitrarily named \"north China team\" and \"south China team\". North China team was headed by Hongyang Wang (who lives in Beijing) and south China team was headed by Yao Yao (who lives in Guangzhou). They used different synthesis and different analysis, i.e. north China team used hydrothermal synthesis and used SQUID measurement, while south China team used solid state synthesis and used EPR measurement.This is a joint paper of both teams. They reproduced results of each other (this is unclear in the paper, but stated in their behind-the-scene posts) and measured a clear sign of superconductivity. It is \"near room temperature\", because they are sure about 250 K (hence \"near\"), but not sure about 300 K. As for \"possible\", the behind-the-scene post makes it clear it is false modesty.If you are interested, you definitely want to read behind-the-scene posts. Read them here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zhihu.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;637763289 (they are in Chinese). Hongyang Wang is 真可爱呆 and Yao Yao is 洗芝溪. reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agoparent> As for \"possible\", the behind-the-scene post makes it clear it is false modesty.It&#x27;s not false modesty to withhold a conclusion that is unwarranted without more evidence. The last time this happened there was also \"possible Meissner effect\" that turned out to be diamagnetism.There are no downsides to being conservative until more evidence is acquired. reply godelski 15 hours agorootparent> There are no downsides to being conservative until more evidence is acquired.There are, but I&#x27;d agree that there aren&#x27;t downsides we should be concerned with. The downside is that if you&#x27;re trying to publish the work that it can make it easier for the work to be rejected. I&#x27;d agree this is dumb, but it is a thing I&#x27;ve seen happen, and be not too uncommon. Just comes down to metrics: academics are judged by citations and number of papers published, thus papers are written to reviewers as opposed to peers (not necessarily the same thing, but assumed they are), also incentivizes flashy results to generate more publicity, or overselling the novelty of work (sometimes even by mistake). But otherwise I agree, and I think it should be encouraged to take a more tempered approach (I think it&#x27;ll also really help build back social trust in sciences (again, small part of a larger pie)). reply idopmstuff 7 hours agorootparent> The downside is that if you&#x27;re trying to publish the work that it can make it easier for the work to be rejected.I think that given the subject, if this pans out there is no chance they&#x27;ll get rejected. reply godelski 6 hours agorootparentFor this particular example, sure. I mean for this particular subject you&#x27;d have to hand in a really bad paper to get rejected, like past unintelligible, because the breakthrough is big. But I thought we were talking in general. There&#x27;s also very clear downsides to this particular example by not being exceptionally cautious, because even a hint of hype can make them look like incompetent fools if they aren&#x27;t correct. Though that wouldn&#x27;t be good either because they clearly aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s easy to make mistakes in science and even as I frequently told my friends last time, there was something different here and it&#x27;ll probably end in failure (which it did) but that we&#x27;ll learn something important (which looks likely to be true given this paper). reply ChuckMcM 10 hours agorootparentprevI was reading the paper and thought \"Okay, these folks took the LK-99 lesson to heart about being overly enthusiastic in your experimental observations.\" :-)Given that the LK-99 theoretical underpinnings were pretty solid (if not the implementation) I&#x27;ve been watching papers in this space. (on google scholar you can just track papers that cite the LK-99 paper as new follow-ups) reply sigmoid10 16 hours agorootparentprev>There are no downsides to being conservative until more evidence is acquired.That&#x27;s true, but one upside here is that this is not from the guy at Rochester who already got burned twice for publishing false superconductor discoveries. This is at least a report that can&#x27;t be dismissed immediately. reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;re referring to \"from Rochester\", but the excitement from last summer around LK-99 came from two South Korean researchers. Which, mind you, all turned out to be faulty interpretation of their data.To be clear, I don&#x27;t mean to cast unnecessary shade on these current results, I&#x27;m just saying the sane and prudent thing to do, especially given LK-99&#x27;s recent history, is to hold off on any champagne popping, and that appropriate restraint shouldn&#x27;t be characterized as \"false modesty\". reply godelski 15 hours agorootparent> Which, mind you, all turned out to be faulty interpretation of their data.Which we should be critical of, but understandable, since that&#x27;s one of the main reasons to publish (and why I think it is weird we say arxiv papers aren&#x27;t peer reviewed. That was probably one of the most peer reviewed works in the last decade) and since we&#x27;re all human. Science is full of mistakes, and is unsurprising when a lot of it is literally trying to do things that humans have never done before (much more to science than this too).What I thought was really cool about LK-99 is that it isn&#x27;t too often that people get a first hand look at what goes on inside the science communities. An abnormal amount of attention and openness, but illustrative. Just not sure this is the takeaway people got. But I saw science working in action, and it was really cool. reply floxy 15 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ranga_P._Dias reply wiz21c 15 hours agorootparentprevExtraordinary claim should be backed by extraordinary tests.

Why not wait to be certain ?There are very good reasons to publish before one is \"100% certain\". It can get lots of other scientists to evaluate your information where they can try to reproduce it or poke holes in your theories. It just makes sense to do that with a tone of \"We got some interesting results...\" as opposed to what happened in the summer which was more like \"We&#x27;ve made one of the biggest discoveries of mankind!!!\" reply vlovich123 14 hours agorootparentYeah, there’s a very good argument I’ve read from researchers that instead of papers we should be publishing continuously what our results are to encourage this early and often community interaction&#x2F;feedback (ie more like code reviews). The reason it doesn’t happen is publish&#x2F;perish + needing to be first to publish (ie someone taking your work and beating you to the punch and getting all the credit). reply micromacrofoot 8 hours agorootparentmore live-streamed science, fewer pdfs reply Retric 12 hours agorootparentprevGetting other people to inspect your work sounds great for you but it costs those people a time and money.So, the incentives for misuse are really high and the net result is that shortcutting the process is a net drag on progress. People remember the bigs stuff like FTL neutrinos, cold fusion, NK-99, etc but arguably this also shows up as part of the ‘reproducibility crisis’ in many fields. reply WhitneyLand 13 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not published, it’s a pre-print on arxiv.That’s one of the purposes of arxiv is to allow others to review or comment on the work. reply harry8 10 hours agorootparentSeems like an alternative definition of the word “publish” given it’s freely available for anyone to read… reply dekhn 7 hours agorootparentPeople argue about whether putting stuff on arxiv constitutes \"publication\". I like the loose definition of publish (it&#x27;s available for a wide audience to read, with at most, pay barriers) but other folks do not. There is still a huge cachet in being able to point at a peer-reviewed paper in a prestigious journal, no doubt, and many people will consider arxiv a preprint server, not a publication.(in the old days, after your article was accepted, but before it was published, they&#x27;d send you a few copies labelled \"preprint\" that you could distribute informally) reply IanCal 9 hours agorootparentprevNo just a standard use of the term for academia. replycivilized 8 hours agorootparentprevThe guy from Rochester is Ranga Dias.

Last Friday, I always stayed there to test and kept sending me photos and live broadcast the real-time measurement results. Every time I sent one, I couldn&#x27;t help drinking a drink. I was directly broken. I was carried back by the students. It&#x27;s embarrassing~~ reply lucasban 8 hours agorootparentWhat impressed me was that Safari translated the text in the screenshots as well, I wasn’t expecting that. reply gwern 15 hours agoparentprevThis is LK-99 derived? Now I&#x27;m even less interested. Because if you believe this one, you need to believe that despite LK-99 being bogus, that somehow, trying to make a new LK-99 variant was lucky enough to find the one compound out of countless attempts that winds up working - as opposed to coming out of a completely different, still viable, line of research. Stranger things have happened in the history of science & technology... but not that many. reply bandyaboot 13 hours agorootparentThis would be a difficult to believe coincidence if diamagnetism and superconductivity were unrelated physical properties, but they are not. reply scythe 12 hours agorootparentThe hard part is that people have already tried really hard to make and measure a superconductor in the LK-99 system, and these researchers have once again gotten close, but not succeeded. There is some precedent for this: one of the highest-temperature superconductors is two-dimensional iron selenide supported on strontium titanate, which superconducts at 100 K, while the bulk iron selenide superconductivity is a measly 8 K at normal pressure (38 K under pressure). At this point, the most plausible way that superconductivity could be occurring in the LK-99 system is if it&#x27;s in a metastable or nanostructured (possibly two-dimensional) phase that doesn&#x27;t like to or can&#x27;t exist as a uniform bulk material. reply axelcontoli 4 hours agorootparentprevThat scenario, if true, would surpass any other in the history of science. It&#x27;s akin to the Monty Hall problem, but with a trillion doors, where you don&#x27;t change your choice after all but two are shown not to have the superconductor.So obviously if true there&#x27;s a better explanation of why those early experiments failed. reply sanxiyn 14 hours agorootparentprevYes this is LK-99 derived. (See the paper&#x27;s reference 4 and 5.) Eh, of course it is unlikely LK-99 is bogus and this one is not, but then the correct conclusion to draw is that LK-99 is not bogus? reply gus_massa 14 hours agorootparentPerhaps LK-99 is bogus, and they were triying to reproduce the result, they failed succesfully and they got another similar compound that is not bogus. reply gfodor 14 hours agorootparentThat’s possible but far less likely than the alternative explanation that either this is bunk too or LK-99 contained signal that people dismissed due to a hole in our methodology. reply mort96 13 hours agorootparentprevWait how are all the flaws in the paper and all the failed reproductions of LK-99 and all the signs that LK-99 is just diamagnetism compatible with LK-99 being a proper superconductor? reply Accujack 8 hours agorootparentThe thing is.... all the failed reproductions of LK-99 were based on the leaked version of the paper, which according to the authors is missing some information&#x2F;steps for production. They said they would publish the complete&#x2F;final version of the paper in 2024, waiting to see that. reply bloopernova 19 hours agoparentprevHow does 250 K compare to current[1] superconductors?[1] pun definitely intended. reply VikingCoder 19 hours agorootparentJokes like that are going to get a lot of resistance.

The third doesn&#x27;t hold up too well, but the first two are great. The funny part was that she saw the 80s and the 50s as basically the same. reply phkahler 11 hours agorootparent>> The funny part was that she saw the 80s and the 50s as basically the same.Is that because neither of them have any electronic devices?

Will definitely be looking more closely when I watch with the family replysixothree 15 hours agorootparentprevMovies of the 80s and 90s feel a lot more modern compared to the “old movies” we had living in the 80s. Black and white movies with cardboard acting sure felt quaint for the tv generation.Today though I’m constantly surprised by the number of young people who recognize things from 80s movies and especially music. I’d say that number is higher compared to our generation. reply Sanzig 15 hours agorootparentThe 80s and 90s produced a lot of movies that became pop culture classics (Back to the Future among them).Millenials and Gen Z grew up in an era with much easier access to older media than previous generations. First was the video store - while Gen X had this too, it really took off in the 90s. I remember when I was a kid in the late 90s and early 2000s, it was $5 to rent a new release or 3 for $5 for old releases. This meant that we were basically encouraged by our parents to watch older stuff, and of course the fact that they lived through the 80s themselves meant they tended to recommend movies to us from that era.Of course, after the video store came VOD services like Netflix. Old movies are a great way to pad out a VOD catalogue, so that increased the access to 80s&#x2F;90s movies even more.It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, many of these films still hold up pretty well today. reply radicalbyte 14 hours agorootparentprevWe started to get a lot of the classic movies in the 70s (Taxi Driver, Godfather, Star Wars, Halloween, Blazing Saddles, Rocky, Alien, Clockwork Orange, Exorcist, Jaws, Apocalypse Now just to name a few) and the 80s went absolutely wild and - particularly - far more broad. The kids films from the 80s didn&#x27;t really exist before then (outside of Disney).In the 50s&#x2F;60s there were less (but still some of per personal faves) and the dominant genres (Westerns particularly) have been out of fashion for at least 40 years now. reply MobileVet 10 hours agorootparentprevFrankly I am shocked I got 27 up votes.

Sure, it&#x27;d be one thing to make it in a computer, and making the materials in the real world is quite another but I&#x27;m kind of shocked no one has come forward with something yet. I saw simulations of whole viruses running on a cluster of computers where they test drugs out and how they interact with the virus and simulated human cells so one would think its something with enough effort would be possible? reply frostix 17 hours agorootparentThis is done across many disciplines to try and aide in new discovery paths. Typically you’re limited in exactly what you can simulate and often times solution candidates may be found that are impractical, currently impossible, or perhaps actually impossible to produce. Sometimes you can add search constraints to tie simulations together to narrow down such false positive solutions found but not always. Heck in some cases it’s literally cheaper and more accurate to do the bench science no matter how alluring virtualized renditions may be.Most fields are still left with piles and piles of potential solutions to sort through. They often select candidates that are the cheapest and most practical to approach or they have high suspicion of success and pursue those. At the end of the day though we don’t have full universe simulators at every scale we’d want, we have very specific area simulators within very specific bounds. You have to go out an empirically test these things.But this is and has already been going on for decades across most disciplines I’ve interacted with, they just weren’t using DNN or LLMs at the time but domains are adopting these as well to leverage where feasible in the search process.I work with a variety of people interested in leveraging simulation and everyone wants to take the successes they see in LLMs or say RL from AlphaStar or AlphaGo and apply them in their domain. It’s alluring, I get it, the issue is that we often lack enough real understanding in domains and the science isn’t as airtight and people think it is, its too general or narrow, or on some cases we have good suspicion of how to build better more accurate simulations but there’s not enough compute power or energy in the world to make them currently practical, so we need to take some tradeoffs and live with less accurate and detailed simulation which leads to inaccurate representations of reality and ultimately inaccurate solution suggestion candidates. reply dekhn 7 hours agorootparentprevSupercomputers (the classical kind) typically don&#x27;t want to run codes that try lots of combinations; they were designed for, excel at, and cost a lot because of, the need to speed up single runs at a time. This is partly due to history, and partly due to definitions of supercomputers, but every time I proposed runs like this (proteins&#x2F;drugs) to the supercomputer centers, they told me to bug off because my codes \"only scaled to 64 processors\" (that&#x27;s 64 servers, mind you; before SMP was common).We did what you described using idle cycles at Google (search for \"Exacycle\") and we got great results doing large scale parameter explorations (either randomly sampled, or sampled based on where the previous sims suggested looking next)- although, nobody actually did material simulations like this, we did proteins.Realistically, almost nobody does this because it&#x27;s just not cost effective (the search space is too large, the loss functions aren&#x27;t accurate enough, and it uses TONS of energy), and more importantly, somebody else is just going to find a way to generate 75% of the results with 25% of the energy, and that person will get published faster. reply radarsat1 17 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t the whole point that it&#x27;s something we might not predict from what we understand about the materials so far?

So a small fragment might have a tiny fleck of iron in a corner, which is stuck to the magnet, but the bulk is repelled. This makes the sample \"half float\", with one corner always touching. After a while you start noticing the consistent look of the samples almost-but-not-quite floating askew.Another effect is that if a picture is taken in a dark room with a camera that has the iris wide open, optical effects can blur the point at which the sample touches the magnet. A macro shot of a tiny sample especially is susceptible to this effect, and it can make the sample look like it is truly floating, with a visible \"gap\". Better focus (or focus-stacking) would reveal the small point still in contact with the magnet. reply Havoc 17 hours agoprevWhat encourages me on this is that we just need a single instance to pan out.

Ferromagnetic hysteresis increases with temperature, and the hysteresis here is stronger at lower temperatures. The amount of hysteresis they see at low temperatures is also too much to explain with undetected contamination. Plus, the scientists posted a picture of them fully floating a sample upside-down, which is pretty hard to explain away.Complex answer: Maybe. Copper sulfide does a lot of weird things, and it&#x27;s very easy to screw with ferromagnetism in unexpected ways.

China was an economic basket case and incapable of developing on its own. No country in history has been more generous to another.And what did the US get in return? Currency manipulation, large scale economic espionage and mercantilist behavior, protectionism of Chinese markets and industries, fentanyl, militarization of South China Sea and bullying the countries there, largest and fastest military buildup since 1930s Germany, supporting Russia vs Ukraine, threatening war over Taiwan, etc. \"Unrestricted warfare\".The US didn&#x27;t cause China to do any of that, that was all the CCP&#x27;s decision.

We didn&#x27;t do any of that out of generosity, we did it for profit. We saw a huge pool of cheap labor and decided we wanted to let our companies exploit that. We rubbed our hands together and grinned while selling them the proverbial rope. reply SkyMarshal 13 hours agorootparentIf by \"we\" you mean the 1% of bankers and corporate executives who are the primary beneficiaries of drastically increased profit margins from outsourcing production to countries with no labor or environmental protections, then yes \"we\" did it for profit.But if by \"we\" you mean the large portion of the US middle class whose financial security and upward mobility was obliterated, then no \"we\" did not do it for profit and were extremely generous, sacrificial even, in lifting hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty when the CCP was unable to do that on their own.It&#x27;s not like this is any surprise, Ross Perot was even explicitly warning about it back in 1992: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W3LvZAZ-HV4 reply h0l0cube 9 hours agorootparentThe second \"we\" was all too happy, and still is, to buy cheaper products, even when apprised of the economic consequences. The third beneficiaries are businesses, for whom components and manufacturing are now vastly cheaper, enabling further (taxable) wealth generation that could support the middle-class.If the US had a sensible culture (and hence democratically driven government policy) behind education, a skilled labor pool could have emerged to develop high-tech manufacturing that leveraged China&#x27;s low-skill labor pool. Instead, China has &#x27;hid its strength, and bided its time&#x27;, establishing its own high-skill labor pool and advanced manufacturing capability, giving it substantial leverage over the entire world, without so much as starting a proxy war, usurping foreign lands, assassinating foreign political leaders, etc.US hegemony is absolutely its own to lose, but it all depends on the culture driving it. reply ethbr1 15 hours agorootparentprevLifting half a billion+ people out of poverty and enabling a country to modernize seems like a decent outcome.Regardless of the motivations and machinations on either government&#x27;s part. reply aragonite 15 hours agorootparentprev> That&#x27;s very arguable when it was the US who led the world in opening up to China in the 90s&#x2F;early 2000s, opening its markets to China, bringing China into the WTO, etc. (all at great cost to middle class Americans).

No country in history has been more generous to another.I&#x27;m intrigued by the metrics you&#x27;re using to conclude that the US has been more generous towards China than it has been towards, say, Israel or even Mexico, as a matter of state policy. Especially considering that US placed China under trade embargo and singlehandedly denied it UN representation for 20+ years.The actions you are describing as representing a historically unprecedented level of generosity seems essentially to boil done to US agreeing to maintain normal trade relations with China, similar to those it has with nearly every other country. Worth noting that the US extends Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to all its trading partners — it&#x27;s not some exclusive or rare privilege as its name might suggest but a standard practice in international trade. reply SkyMarshal 13 hours agorootparent>than it has been towards, say, Israel or even Mexico,Partly due to what it cost the US public.

If I remember right....someone managed to reverse engineer the Intel 8086 or the 8080....but my understanding is that our lithography is so complex at this point you can&#x27;t accurately reverse engineer the physical chip layout. If one could reverse engineer the physical layout and chemical layers...you could probably use that information to reverse engineer the photolithography mask and chemical etching step.TLDR: we can&#x27;t reverse those modern server CPU&#x27;s ....we can only learn via what the fan or the chiplet owner be it Intel or and or apple decides to release regarding architecture or chip layout. reply troglodynellc 16 hours agorootparentBack when I worked at TI we had a neat machine that used X-Rays to map and reverse competitor chips (mostly to discover they were duping ours). It would work down to just short of a 10nm resolution.You&#x27;d need to use gamma spectrography to map out more modern chips.

    "originBody": "FrameOS On this page FrameOS FrameOS is an operating system for single function smart frames. It's meant to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi, and can be used with a variety of e-ink and traditional displays. It's designed for both screens that update 60 seconds per frame, and for screens that update 60 frames per second. Think smart home calendars, meeting room displays, thermostats, industrial dashboards, public advertisement screens, and more. Features: Centralized Deployment: The FrameOS Controller connects to Raspberry Pis via SSH for direct software installation. Compiled & Efficient: FrameOS is written in Nim, a compiled language. Your final configuration gets compiled down into a single efficient binary that contains all apps, assets and drivers. Diagram Editor: A drag-and-drop interface to combine Nim apps into scenes. Fork and edit existing apps like \"OpenAI image\", and \"Text overlay\" to suit your needs. Overwrite all fields with inline code snippets. GPT4 Support: Ask your favourite LLM to write and debug FrameOS apps for you. Hardware Guides: For tested displays, we provide hardware guides, installation instructions, and 3D printable cases. Getting started Start by installing the FrameOS controller. Then set up the raspberry, while following the device guide for your specific screen. Supported platforms We support all the most common e-ink displays out there. Pimoroni e-ink frames Waveshare e-ink Framebuffer HDMI output Web server kiosk mode See the full list here! Status FrameOS is good enough for home and hobbyist usage. This software is still in early development, and does not have a stable release. A docker image is generated for every push to main. There are no guarantees things won't suddenly break between releases, despite our best efforts. If you're the adventurous type, please try it out, and help out. Look at the tasklist for ideas. Don't ask for permission, just submit a PR. If you're not sure, open an issue and we'll discuss it. Why? Read the blog post: Why FrameOS? Read more about the Nim rewrite. Edit this page",

I worked on a 7 color eInk Arduino-based picture frame two years ago for a gift. My biggest issue was that I had to manually crop, dither, and color index the images to get them to look _okay_ on the display. If FrameOS could handle all of that for me then it would have saved hours of manual editing and testing.I ended up getting that same person an Aura frame this year because remotely adding photos ended up miserable reply kevin_thibedeau 14 hours agoparentImagemagick can batch process images with restricted palettes. No reason you had to do it all manually. reply mariusandra 15 hours agoparentprevI definitely do not want anyone to manually crop, dither and color index images. This should be done by the FrameOS software. It&#x27;s already working if you use e.g. Inky Impression 7 color frames, but mostly because I just defer to their software&#x2F;drivers, which already handle this... reply gadgetoid 12 hours agorootparentOur crude (actually Pillow’s IIRC) dither has a certain nostalgic appeal to it, but can definitely be bested by other algorithms. I’m still not totally convinced we have a great perceptual match for the colours either. The approach to get them - take a photo of the screen, use a colour dropper and a bit of eye balling - was crude.(Hi, I wrote most of the Inky driver and your project is the kind of awesome I wish the Pico&#x2F;RP2040-based Inky Frame devices could pull off.) reply mariusandra 12 hours agorootparentHa, nice to meet you.I always say \"if it&#x27;s stupid and it works, it&#x27;s not stupid\". Your approach to get the dithering right sounds brilliant to me :D.The current inky driver works great, and that fact that it&#x27;s in Python is what made me develop the original FrameOS software in Python. However now that I rewrote it in Nim, the Python driver is a bit of a crutch. While I could use the C drivers for the Waveshare displays, I&#x27;m forced to install a python wrapper on the Pi as a workaround to get the Inky drivers working.Do you have any idea if there are any C, or even Nim drivers available for the Inky Impression boards? The Python workaround works, but isn&#x27;t really elegant. If not, I&#x27;m considering porting them myself at some point...I&#x27;m also lurking on the Pimoroni discord, and was meaning to ask there about it as well. reply djazzz 11 hours agorootparentI have written drivers for Pimoroni&#x27;s Inky Frames (based on Raspberry Pi Pico W) in Nim, but I don&#x27;t own an Inky Impression.

I’ll get a nice bright screen and anything I want to see just needs to be viewable in a web browser. reply mariusandra 13 hours agorootparentI used to have an iPad (3rd gen) on the wall, then it died. I bought the cheapest new one to replace it, but the old Android tablet I had around had better bluetooth reach, so it went on the wall instead.Old android tablets are notoriously unpatched against all kinds of things. It&#x27;s easy to be paranoid that some passing foot traffic will infect it with a bluetooth worm, and you&#x27;ll be none the wiser.I&#x27;m accepting the risk for now, as I do enjoy configuring Home Assistant on it, and looking at the rainmap, but there are times when when a full tablet is overkill. FrameOS is for those cases. reply NoboruWataya 15 hours agoprevLooks really interesting. Am I right in thinking it&#x27;s not actually an OS, but rather software that runs on top of an OS on the Pi? reply mariusandra 13 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re technically right (the best kind?), but there&#x27;s some nuance to the question.FrameOS is a compiled binary that runs on top of Linux. At present you need to install the \"Raspberry Pi OS Lite\" (without the desktop environment) on a SD card before you can install FrameOS itself on top of that. So it&#x27;s \"just an application\".However, this is mostly because it&#x27;s an early project, and this was the fastest way to get going. The next step is to see how much can be removed. Since FrameOS is a statically compiled single binary, it shouldn&#x27;t need that much more than the Linux kernel? Will FrameOS be a true OS then? Android seems to be considered its own OS despite using the Linux kernel.Once activated, FrameOS takes over your entire system, has its own `apps&#x2F;` and `drivers&#x2F;` folders, and in many ways already behaves like an Operating System. I&#x27;m also pondering about getting it running on an ESP32 (will need to add `drivers&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;`?). Without any OS below it, will it then be worthy of being called an OS? You all tell me. :shrug:Thus is it an Operating System? It is to me, but you can choose to disagree.At my actual job (PostHog), we sometimes call ourselves the \"Product OS\". This annoys me more, as a suite of webapps definitely isn&#x27;t an \"Operating System\" in its traditional sense.

It was a bit fussy to always have to use a terminal to SSH into the Pi, then update the scripts through FileZilla (ftp client) + Vscode.I&#x27;ve just completed a dashboard project which I&#x27;m about to release and I was also thinking of switching my frame drivers to ESP32 to run them on batteries, since they consume far less energy than even a Pi Zero. So +1 for ESP32 compatibility if time allows! reply brk 12 hours agoparentHow deep are you in the ESP32 dev? I&#x27;ve found image rendering (the display is LCD, not eInk) to be less straightforward than anticipated.In my case, massaging images into a specific size and format prior to sending them into the ESP32&#x2F;Display is easier and more reliable than trying to have the ESP libraries display any arbitrary image. reply malcolmosh 12 hours agorootparentI haven’t actually started coding yet with the ESP chip. In my case the aim is to pick up a preformatted image from an URL, avoiding all of the finicky formatting you describe.

I&#x27;m using a Raspberry Pi Zero W with a Waveshare 7.5 e-ink panel, which came with its own raspberry Pi driver. I also added a PiSugar2 battery. Waveshare seemed to be the most affordable option out there.I find the costs to be reasonable, but I just bought a Waveshare e-ink ESP32 controller to try boosting battery life, since I don&#x27;t need a fully fledged OS. All I&#x27;m doing on the frame is pulling an image from an URL or displaying a local image if the connection fails. reply gadgetoid 12 hours agorootparentThis sounds like it could port well to an RP2040-based display. Though I am forever battling against its very constrained RAM for network stuff (not helped by MicroPython needing a chunk for buffers, an GC bitmap for mark&#x2F;sweep and some other network mystery meat). That said our (Pimoroni) larger Pico W-based Inky has an 8Mbit PSRAM to act as a back buffer for the display. It’s “slow” but when updates take 30s+ anyway that’s kind of redundant. Very little of that 8Mbit is actually used, so with a little tinkering it might be able to cache multiple images for sequential display without having to faff about with SD cards.Currently I transmute some images (XKCD and NASA APOD) via a scheduled GitHub action into something fit for the various display sizes. An even more extreme approach would be to convert into the packed (4bpp for 7-colour E-ink) framebuffer format server-side. Less network efficient, but more predictable memory usage.We’ve had JPEG support for a while, but I brought up a PNG decoder (Larry Bank’s PNGdec) recently(ish) and it’s a much better fit than JPEG for palette-based images. It uses a 32K sliding window, however, which can get spicy if you’re not careful. reply sydbarrett74 11 hours agoprevReaaallly cool project.

I have a fast RPi 5 for testing, and the feedback loop is typically ~30sec. It&#x27;s about a minute with a Zero W2, and about 2min with a Zero W.

New frames get rendered when a render event is dispatched, which can happen automatically on an interval, or as requested. Frames send logs back to their controller, but can otherwise operate completely independently. reply dgellow 16 hours agoparentprevBased on screenshots that looks like dearimgui.

    "title": "Demystifying the Math Behind Transformers: A Comprehensive Overview and Implementation Guide",
    "originLink": "https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/random_transformer/",
    "originBody": "The Random Transformer Understand how transformers work by demystifying all the math behind them Published January 1, 2024 In this blog post, we’ll do an end-to-end example of the math within a transformer model. The goal is to get a good understanding of how the model works. To make this manageable, we’ll do lots of simplification. As we’ll be doing quite a bit of the math by hand, we’ll reduce the dimensions of the model. For example, rather than using embeddings of 512 values, we’ll use embeddings of 4 values. This will make the math easier to follow! We’ll use random vectors and matrices, but you can use your own values if you want to follow along. As you’ll see, the math is not that complicated. The complexity comes from the number of steps and the number of parameters. I recommend you to read the The Illustrated Transformer blog before reading this blog post (or reading in parallel). It’s a great blog post that explains the transformer model in a very intuitive (and illustrative!) way and I don’t intend to explain what it’s already explained there. My goal is to explain the “how” of the transformer model, not the “what”. If you want to dive even deeper, check out the famous original paper: Attention is all you need. Prerequisites A basic understanding of linear algebra is required - we’ll mostly do simple matrix multiplications, so no need to be an expert. Apart from that, basic understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning will be useful. What is covered here? An end-to-end example of the math within a transformer model during inference An explanation of attention mechanisms An explanation of residual connections and layer normalization Some code to scale it up! Without further ado, let’s get started! Our goal will be to use the transformer model as a translation tool, so we’ll pass an input to the model expecting it to generate the translation. For example, we could pass “Hello World” in English and expect “Hola Mundo” in Spanish. Let’s take a look at the diagram of the transformer beast (don’t be intimidatd by it, you’ll soon understand it!): Transformer model from the original “attention is all you need” paper The original transformer model has two parts: encoder and decoder. The encoder focus is in “understanding” or “capturing the meaning” of the input text, while the decoder focus is in generating the output text. We’ll first focus on the encoder part. Encoder The whole goal of the encoder is to generate a rich embedding representation of the input text. This embedding will capture semantic information about the input, and will then be passed to the decoder to generate the output text. The encoder is composed of a stack of N layers. Before we jump into the layers, we need to see how to pass the words (or tokens) into the model. Note Embeddings are a somewhat overused term. We’ll first create an embedding that will be the input to the encoder. The encoder also outputs an embedding (also called hidden states sometimes). The decoder will also receive an embedding! 😅 The whole point of an embedding is to represent a token as a vector. 0. Tokenization ML models can process numbers, not text. soo we need to turn our input text into numbers. That’s what tokenization does! This is the process of splitting the input text into tokens, each with an associated ID. For example, we could split the text “Hello World” into two tokens: “Hello” and “World”. We could also split it into characters: “H”, “e”, “l”, “l”, “o”, ” “,”W”, “o”, “r”, “l”, “d”. The choice of tokenization is up to us and depends on the data we’re working with. Word-based tokenization (splitting the text into words) will require a very large vocabulary (all possible tokens). It will also represent words like “dog” and “dogs” or “run” and “running” as different tokens. Character-based vocabulary will require a smaller vocabulary, but will provide less meaning (in can be useful for languages such as Chinese where each character carries more information). The field has moved towards subword tokenization. This is a middle ground between word-based and character-based tokenization. We’ll split the words into subwords. For example, we could split “tokenization” into “token” and “ization”. How do we decide how to split the words? This is part of training a tokenizer through a statistical process that tries to identify which subwords are the best to pick given a dataset. It’s a deterministic process (unlike training a ML model). For this blog post, let’s go with word tokenization for simplicity. Our goal will be to translate “Hello World” from English to Spanish. Given an example “Hello World”, we’ll split into tokens: “Hello” and “World”. Each token has an associated ID defined in the model’s vocabulary. For example, “Hello” could be token 1 and “World” could be token 2. 1. Embedding the text Although we could pass the token IDs to the model (e.g. 1 and 2), these numbers don’t carry any meaning. We need to turn them into vectors (list of numbers). This is what embedding does! The token embeddings map a token ID to a fixed-size vector with some semantic meaning of the tokens**. These brings some interesting properties: similar tokens will have a similar embedding (in other words, calculating the cosine similarity between two embeddings will give us a good idea of how similar the tokens are). Note that the mapping from a token to an embedding is learned. Although we could use a pre-trained embedding such as word2vec or GloVe, transformers models learn these embeddings as part of their training. This is a big advantage as the model can learn the best representation of the tokens for the task at hand. For example, the model could learn that “dog” and “dogs” should have similar embeddings. All embeddings in a single model have the same size. The original transformer used a size of 512, but let’s do 4 for our example so we can keep the maths manageable. I’ll assign some random values to each token (as mentioned, this mapping is usually learned by the model). Hello -> [1,2,3,4] World -> [2,3,4,5] Note After releasing this blog post, multiple persons raised questions about the embeddings above. I was a bit lazy and just wrote down some numbers that will make for some nice math below. In practice, these numbers would be learned by the model. I’ve updated the blog post to make this clearer. Thanks to everyone who raised this question! We can estimate how similar these vectors are using cosine similarity, which would be too high for the vectors above. In practice, a vector would likely look something like [-0.071, 0.344, -0.12, 0.026, …, -0.008]. We can represent our input as a single matrix 𝐸 = [ 1 2 3 4 2 3 4 5 ] Note Although we could manage the two embeddings as separate vectors, it’s easier to manage them as a single matrix. This is because we’ll be doing matrix multiplications as we move forward! 2 Positional encoding The embedding above has no information about the position of the word in the sentence, so we need to feed some positional information. The way we do this is by adding a positional encoding to the embedding. There are different choices on how to obtain these - we could use a learned embedding or a fixed vector. The original paper uses a fixed vector as they see almost no difference between the two approaches (see section 3.5 of the original paper). We’ll use a fixed vector as well. Sine and cosine functions have a wave-like pattern, and they repeat over time. By using these functions, each position in the sentence gets a unique yet consistent positional encoding. Given they repeat over time, it can help the model more easily learn patterns like proximity and distance between elements. These are the functions they use in the paper (section 3.5): 𝑃 𝐸 ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 , 2 𝑖 ) = sin ⁡ ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 10000 2 𝑖 / 𝑑 model ) 𝑃 𝐸 ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 , 2 𝑖 + 1 ) = cos ⁡ ( 𝑝 𝑜 𝑠 10000 2 𝑖 / 𝑑 model ) The idea is to interpolate between sine and cosine for each value in the embedding (even indices will use sine, odd indices will use cosine). Let’s calculate them for our example! For “Hello” i = 0 (even): PE(0,0) = sin(0 / 10000^(0 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0 i = 1 (odd): PE(0,1) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*1 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1 i = 2 (even): PE(0,2) = sin(0 / 10000^(2*2 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0 i = 3 (odd): PE(0,3) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*3 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1 For “World” i = 0 (even): PE(1,0) = sin(1 / 10000^(0 / 4)) = sin(1 / 10000^0) = sin(1) ≈ 0.84 i = 1 (odd): PE(1,1) = cos(1 / 10000^(2*1 / 4)) = cos(1 / 10000^0.5) ≈ cos(0.01) ≈ 0.99 i = 2 (even): PE(1,2) = sin(1 / 10000^(2*2 / 4)) = sin(1 / 10000^1) ≈ 0 i = 3 (odd): PE(1,3) = cos(1 / 10000^(2*3 / 4)) = cos(1 / 10000^1.5) ≈ 1 So concluding “Hello” -> [0, 1, 0, 1] “World” -> [0.84, 0.99, 0, 1] Note that these encodings have the same dimension as the original embedding. Note While we use sine and cosine as the original paper, there are other ways to do this. BERT, a very popular transformer, use trainable positional embeddings. 3. Add positional encoding and embedding We now add the positional encoding to the embedding. This is done by adding the two vectors together. “Hello” = [1,2,3,4] + [0, 1, 0, 1] = [1, 3, 3, 5] “World” = [2,3,4,5] + [0.84, 0.99, 0, 1] = [2.84, 3.99, 4, 6] So our new matrix, which will be the input to the encoder, is: 𝐸 = [ 1 3 3 5 2.84 3.99 4 6 ] If you look at the original paper’s image, what we just did is the bottom left part of the image (the embedding + positional encoding). Transformer model from the original “attention is all you need” paper 4. Self-attention 4.1 Matrices Definition We’ll now introduce the concept of multi-head attention. Attention is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input. Multi-head attention is a way to allow the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces. This is done by using multiple attention heads. Each attention head will have its own K, V, and Q matrices. Let’s use 2 attention heads for our example. We’ll use random values for these matrices. Each matrix will be a 4x3 matrix. With this, each matrix will transform the 4-dimensional embeddings into 3-dimensional keys, values, and queries. This reduces the dimensionality for attention mechanism, which helps in managing the computational complexity. Note that using a too small attention size will hurt the performance of the model. Let’s use the following values (just random values): For the first head 𝑊 𝐾 1 = [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] , 𝑊 𝑉 1 = [ 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] , 𝑊 𝑄 1 = [ 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 ] For the second head 𝑊 𝐾 2 = [ 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] , 𝑊 𝑉 2 = [ 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 ] , 𝑊 𝑄 2 = [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 ] 4.2 Keys, queries, and values calculation We now need to multiply our input embeddings with the weight matrices to obtain the keys, queries, and values. Key calculation𝐸 × 𝑊 𝐾 1 = [ 1 3 3 5 2.84 3.99 4 6 ] [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ] = [ ( 1 × 1 ) + ( 3 × 0 ) + ( 3 × 1 ) + ( 5 × 0 ) ( 1 × 0 ) + ( 3 × 1 ) + ( 3 × 0 ) + ( 5 × 1 ) ( 1 × 1 ) + ( 3 × 0 ) + ( 3 × 1 ) + ( 5 × 0 ) ( 2.84 × 1 ) + ( 3.99 × 0 ) + ( 4 × 1 ) + ( 6 × 0 ) ( 2.84 × 0 ) + ( 4 × 1 ) + ( 4 × 0 ) + ( 6 × 1 ) ( 2.84 × 1 ) + ( 4 × 0 ) + ( 4 × 1 ) + ( 6 × 0 ) ] = [ 4 8 4 6.84 9.99 6.84 ] Ok, I actually do not want to do the math by hand for all of these - it gets a bit repetitive plus it breaks the site. So let’s cheat and use NumPy to do the calculations for us. We first define the matrices import numpy as np WK1 = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]) WV1 = np.array([[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]) WQ1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]) WK2 = np.array([[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]) WV2 = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0]]) WQ2 = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]]) And let’s confirm that I didn’t make any mistakes in the calculations above. embedding = np.array([[1, 3, 3, 5], [2.84, 3.99, 4, 6]]) K1 = embedding @ WK1 K1 array([[4. , 8. , 4. ], [6.84, 9.99, 6.84]]) Phew! Let’s now get the values and queries Value calculations V1 = embedding @ WV1 V1 array([[6. , 6. , 4. ], [7.99, 8.84, 6.84]]) Query calculations Q1 = embedding @ WQ1 Q1 array([[8. , 3. , 3. ], [9.99, 3.99, 4. ]]) Let’s skip the second head for now and focus on the first head final score. We’ll come back to the second head later. 4.3 Attention calculation Calculating the attention score requires a couple of steps: Calculate the dot product of the query with each key Divide the result by the square root of the dimension of the key vector Apply a softmax function to obtain the attention weights Multiply each value vector by the attention weights 4.3.1 Dot product of query with each key The score for “Hello” requires calculating the dot product of q1 with each key vector (k1 and k2) 𝑞 1 ⋅ 𝑘 1 = [ 8 3 3 ] ⋅ [ 4 8 4 ] = 8 ⋅ 4 + 3 ⋅ 8 + 3 ⋅ 4 = 68 In matrix world, that would be Q1 multiplied by the transpose of K1𝑄 1 × 𝐾 1 ⊤ = [ 8 3 3 9.99 3.99 4 ] × [ 4 6.84 8 9.99 4 6.84 ] = [ 8 ⋅ 4 + 3 ⋅ 8 + 3 ⋅ 4 8 ⋅ 6.84 + 3 ⋅ 9.99 + 3 ⋅ 6.84 9.99 ⋅ 4 + 3.99 ⋅ 8 + 4 ⋅ 4 9.99 ⋅ 6.84 + 3.99 ⋅ 9.99 + 4 ⋅ 6.84 ] = [ 68 105.21 87.88 135.5517 ] I’m prone to do mistakes, so let’s confirm with Python once again scores1 = Q1 @ K1.T scores1 array([[ 68. , 105.21 ], [ 87.88 , 135.5517]]) 4.3.2 Divide by square root of dimension of key vector We then divide the scores by the square root of the dimension (d) of the keys (3 in this case, but 64 in the original paper). Why? For large values of d, the dot product grows too large (we’re adding the multiplication of a bunch of numbers, after all, leading to high values). And large values are bad! We’ll discuss soon more about this. scores1 = scores1 / np.sqrt(3) scores1 array([[39.2598183 , 60.74302182], [50.73754166, 78.26081048]]) 4.3.3 Apply softmax function We then softmax to normalize so they are all positive and add up to 1. What is softmax? Softmax is a function that takes a vector of values and returns a vector of values between 0 and 1, where the sum of the values is 1. It’s a nice way of obtaining probabilities. It’s defined as follows: softmax ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) = 𝑒 𝑥 𝑖 ∑ 𝑗 = 1 𝑛 𝑒 𝑥 𝑗 Don’t be intimidated by the formula - it’s actually quite simple. Let’s say we have the following vector:𝑥 = [ 1 2 3 ] The softmax of this vector would be:softmax ( 𝑥 ) = [ 𝑒 1 𝑒 1 + 𝑒 2 + 𝑒 3 𝑒 2 𝑒 1 + 𝑒 2 + 𝑒 3 𝑒 3 𝑒 1 + 𝑒 2 + 𝑒 3 ] = [ 0.09 0.24 0.67 ] As you can see, the values are all positive and add up to 1. def softmax(x): return np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x), axis=1, keepdims=True) scores1 = softmax(scores1) scores1 array([[4.67695573e-10, 1.00000000e+00], [1.11377182e-12, 1.00000000e+00]]) 4.3.4 Multiply value matrix by attention weights We then multiply times the value matrix attention1 = scores1 @ V1 attention1 array([[7.99, 8.84, 6.84], [7.99, 8.84, 6.84]]) Let’s combine 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, and 4.3.4 into a single formula using matrices (this is from section 3.2.1 of the original paper): 𝐴 𝑡 𝑡 𝑒 𝑛 𝑡 𝑖 𝑜 𝑛 ( 𝑄 , 𝐾 , 𝑉 ) = softmax ( 𝑄 𝐾 ⊤ 𝑑 ) 𝑉 Yes, that’s it! All the math we just did can easily be encapsulated in the attention formula above! Let’s now translate this to code! def attention(x, WQ, WK, WV): K = x @ WK V = x @ WV Q = x @ WQ scores = Q @ K.T scores = scores / np.sqrt(3) scores = softmax(scores) scores = scores @ V return scores attention(embedding, WQ1, WK1, WV1) array([[7.99, 8.84, 6.84], [7.99, 8.84, 6.84]]) We confirm we got same values as above. Let’s chear and use this to obtain the attention scores the second attention head: attention2 = attention(embedding, WQ2, WK2, WV2) attention2 array([[8.84, 3.99, 7.99], [8.84, 3.99, 7.99]]) If you’re wondering how come the attention is the same for the two embeddings, it’s because the softmax is taking our scores to 0 and 1. See this: softmax(((embedding @ WQ2) @ (embedding @ WK2).T) / np.sqrt(3)) array([[1.10613872e-14, 1.00000000e+00], [4.95934510e-20, 1.00000000e+00]]) This is due to bad initialization of the matrices and small vector sizes. Large differences in the scores before applying softmax will just be amplified with softmax, leading to one value being close to 1 and others close to 0. In practice, our initial embedding matrices’ values were maybe too high, leading to high values for the keys, values, and queries, which just grew larger as we multiplied them. Remember when we were dividing by the square root of the dimension of the keys? This is why we do that. If we don’t do that, the values of the dot product will be too large, leading to large values after the softmax. In this case, though, it seems it wasn’t enough given our small values! As a short-term hack, we can scale down the values by a larger amount than the square root of 3. Let’s redefine the attention function but scaling down by 30. This is not a good long-term solution, but it will help us get different values for the attention scores. We’ll get back to a better solution later. def attention(x, WQ, WK, WV): K = x @ WK V = x @ WV Q = x @ WQ scores = Q @ K.T scores = scores / 30 # we just changed this scores = softmax(scores) scores = scores @ V return scores attention1 = attention(embedding, WQ1, WK1, WV1) attention1 array([[7.54348784, 8.20276657, 6.20276657], [7.65266185, 8.35857269, 6.35857269]]) attention2 = attention(embedding, WQ2, WK2, WV2) attention2 array([[8.45589591, 3.85610456, 7.72085664], [8.63740591, 3.91937741, 7.84804146]]) 4.3.5 Heads’ attention output The next layer of the encoder will expect a single matrix, not two. The first step will be to concatenate the two heads’ outputs (section 3.2.2 of the original paper) attentions = np.concatenate([attention1, attention2], axis=1) attentions array([[7.54348784, 8.20276657, 6.20276657, 8.45589591, 3.85610456, 7.72085664], [7.65266185, 8.35857269, 6.35857269, 8.63740591, 3.91937741, 7.84804146]]) We finally multiply this concatenated matrix by a weight matrix to obtain the final output of the attention layer. This weight matrix is also learned! The dimension of the matrix ensures we go back to the same dimension as the embedding (4 in our case). # Just some random values W = np.array( [ [0.79445237, 0.1081456, 0.27411536, 0.78394531], [0.29081936, -0.36187258, -0.32312791, -0.48530339], [-0.36702934, -0.76471963, -0.88058366, -1.73713022], [-0.02305587, -0.64315981, -0.68306653, -1.25393866], [0.29077448, -0.04121674, 0.01509932, 0.13149906], [0.57451867, -0.08895355, 0.02190485, 0.24535932], ] ) Z = attentions @ W Z array([[ 11.46394285, -13.18016471, -11.59340253, -17.04387829], [ 11.62608573, -13.47454936, -11.87126395, -17.4926367 ]]) The image from The Ilustrated Transformer encapsulates all of this in a single image 5. Feed-forward layer 5.1 Basic feed-forward layer After the self-attention layer, the encoder has a feed-forward neural network (FFN). This is a simple network with two linear transformations and a ReLU activation in between. The Illustrated Transformer blog post does not dive into it, so let me briefly explain a bit more. The goal of the FFN is to process and transformer the representation produced by the attention mechanism. The flow is usually as follows (see section 3.3 of the original paper): First linear layer: this usually expands the dimensionality of the input. For example, if the input dimension is 512, the output dimension might be 2048. This is done to allow the model to learn more complex functions. In our simple of example with dimension of 4, we’ll expand to 8. ReLU activation: This is a non-linear activation function. It’s a simple function that returns 0 if the input is negative, and the input if it’s positive. This allows the model to learn non-linear functions. The math is as follows: ReLU ( 𝑥 ) = max ( 0 , 𝑥 ) Second linear layer: This is the opposite of the first linear layer. It reduces the dimensionality back to the original dimension. In our example, we’ll reduce from 8 to 4. We can represent all of this as follows FFN ( 𝑥 ) = ReLU ( 𝑥 𝑊 1 + 𝑏 1 ) 𝑊 2 + 𝑏 2 Just as a reminder, the input for this layer is the Z we calculated in the self-attention above. Here are the values as a reminder 𝑍 = [ 11.46394281 − 13.18016469 − 11.59340253 − 17.04387833 11.62608569 − 13.47454934 − 11.87126395 − 17.49263674 ] Let’s now define some random values for the weight matrices and bias vectors. I’ll do it with code, but you can do it by hand if you feel patient! W1 = np.random.randn(4, 8) W2 = np.random.randn(8, 4) b1 = np.random.randn(8) b2 = np.random.randn(4) And now let’s write the forward pass function def relu(x): return np.maximum(0, x) def feed_forward(Z, W1, b1, W2, b2): return relu(Z.dot(W1) + b1).dot(W2) + b2 output_encoder = feed_forward(Z, W1, b1, W2, b2) output_encoder array([[ -3.24115016, -9.7901049 , -29.42555675, -19.93135286], [ -3.40199463, -9.87245924, -30.05715408, -20.05271018]]) 5.2 Encapsulating everything: The Random Encoder Let’s now write some code to have the multi-head attention and the feed-forward, all together in the encoder block. Note The code optimizes for understanding and educational purposes, not for performance! Don’t judge too hard! d_embedding = 4 d_key = d_value = d_query = 3 d_feed_forward = 8 n_attention_heads = 2 def attention(x, WQ, WK, WV): K = x @ WK V = x @ WV Q = x @ WQ scores = Q @ K.T scores = scores / np.sqrt(d_key) scores = softmax(scores) scores = scores @ V return scores def multi_head_attention(x, WQs, WKs, WVs): attentions = np.concatenate( [attention(x, WQ, WK, WV) for WQ, WK, WV in zip(WQs, WKs, WVs)], axis=1 ) W = np.random.randn(n_attention_heads * d_value, d_embedding) return attentions @ W def feed_forward(Z, W1, b1, W2, b2): return relu(Z.dot(W1) + b1).dot(W2) + b2 def encoder_block(x, WQs, WKs, WVs, W1, b1, W2, b2): Z = multi_head_attention(x, WQs, WKs, WVs) Z = feed_forward(Z, W1, b1, W2, b2) return Z def random_encoder_block(x): WQs = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_query) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] WKs = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_key) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] WVs = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_value) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] W1 = np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_feed_forward) b1 = np.random.randn(d_feed_forward) W2 = np.random.randn(d_feed_forward, d_embedding) b2 = np.random.randn(d_embedding) return encoder_block(x, WQs, WKs, WVs, W1, b1, W2, b2) Recall that our input is the matrix E which has the positional encoding and the embedding. embedding array([[1. , 3. , 3. , 5. ], [2.84, 3.99, 4. , 6. ]]) Let’s now pass this to our random_encoder_block function random_encoder_block(embedding) array([[ -71.76537515, -131.43316885, 13.2938131 , -4.26831998], [ -72.04253781, -131.84091347, 13.3385937 , -4.32872015]]) Nice! This was just one encoder block. The original paper uses 6 encoders. The output of one encoder goes to the next, and so on: def encoder(x, n=6): for _ in range(n): x = random_encoder_block(x) return x encoder(embedding) /tmp/ipykernel_11906/1045810361.py:2: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp return np.exp(x)/np.sum(np.exp(x),axis=1, keepdims=True) /tmp/ipykernel_11906/1045810361.py:2: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide return np.exp(x)/np.sum(np.exp(x),axis=1, keepdims=True) array([[nan, nan, nan, nan], [nan, nan, nan, nan]]) 5.3 Residual and Layer Normalization Uh oh! We’re getting NaNs! It seems our values are too high, and when being passed to the next encoder, they end up being too high and exploding! This is called gradient explosion. Without any kind of normalization, small changes in the input of early layers end up being amplified in later layers. This is a common problem in deep neural networks. There are two common techniques to mitigate this problem: residual connections and layer normalization (section 3.1 of the paper, barely mentioned). Residual connections: Residual connections are simply adding the input of the layer to it output. For example, we add the initial embedding to the output of the attention. Residual connections mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The intuition is that if the gradient is too small, we can just add the input to the output and the gradient will be larger. The math is very simple: Residual ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑥 + Layer ( 𝑥 ) That’s it! We’ll do this to the output of the attention and the output of the feed-forward layer. Layer normalization Layer normalization is a technique to normalize the inputs of a layer. It normalizes across the embedding dimension. The intuition is that we want to normalize the inputs of a layer so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps with the gradient flow. The math does not look so simple at a first glance. LayerNorm ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑥 − 𝜇 𝜎 2 + 𝜖 × 𝛾 + 𝛽 Let’s explain each parameter: 𝜇 is the mean of the embedding 𝜎 is the standard deviation of the embedding 𝜖 is a small number to avoid division by zero. In case the standard deviation is 0, this small epsilon saves the day! 𝛾 and 𝛽 are learned parameters that control scaling and shifting steps. Unlike batch normalization (no worries if you don’t know what it is), layer normalization normalizes across the embedding dimension - that means that each embedding will not be affected by other samples in the batch. The intuition is that we want to normalize the inputs of a layer so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Why do we add the learnable parameters 𝛾 and 𝛽 ? The reason is that we don’t want to lose the representational power of the layer. If we just normalize the inputs, we might lose some information. By adding the learnable parameters, we can learn to scale and shift the normalized values. Combining the equations, the equation for the whole encoder could look like this Z ( 𝑥 ) = LayerNorm ( 𝑥 + Attention ( 𝑥 ) ) FFN ( 𝑥 ) = ReLU ( 𝑥 𝑊 1 + 𝑏 1 ) 𝑊 2 + 𝑏 2 Encoder ( 𝑥 ) = LayerNorm ( 𝑍 ( 𝑥 ) + FFN ( 𝑍 ( 𝑥 ) + 𝑥 ) ) Let’s try with our example! Let’s go with E and Z values from beforeE + Attention(E) = [ 1.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 2.84 3.99 4.0 6.0 ] + [ 11.46394281 − 13.18016469 − 11.59340253 − 17.04387833 11.62608569 − 13.47454934 − 11.87126395 − 17.49263674 ] = [ 12.46394281 − 10.18016469 − 8.59340253 − 12.04387833 14.46608569 − 9.48454934 − 7.87126395 − 11.49263674 ] Let’s now calculate the layer normalization, we can divide it into three steps: Compute mean and variance for each embedding. Normalize by substracting the mean of its row and dividing by the square root of its row variance (plus a small number to avoid division by zero). Scale and shift by multiplying by gamma and adding beta. 5.3.1 Mean and variance For the first embedding 𝜇 1 = 12.46394281 − 10.18016469 − 8.59340253 − 12.04387833 4 = − 4.58837568 𝜎 2 = ∑ ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝜇 ) 2 𝑁 = ( 12.46394281 − ( − 4.588375685 ) ) 2 + … + ( − 12.04387833 − ( − 4.588375685 ) ) 2 4 = 393.67443005013 4 = 98.418607512533 𝜎 = 98.418607512533 = 9.9206152789297 We can do the same for the second embedding. We’ll skip the calculations but you get the hang of it. 𝜇 2 = − 3.59559109 𝜎 2 = 10.50653018 Let’s confirm with Python (embedding + Z).mean(axis=-1, keepdims=True) array([[-4.58837567], [-3.59559107]]) (embedding + Z).std(axis=-1, keepdims=True) array([[ 9.92061529], [10.50653019]]) Amazing! Let’s now normalize 5.3.2 Normalize For normalization, for each value in the embedding, we subsctract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. Epsilon is a very small value, such as 0.00001. We’ll assume 𝛾 = 1 and 𝛽 = 0 , it simplifies things. normalized 1 = 12.46394281 − ( − 4.58837568 ) 98.418607512533 + 𝜖 = 17.05231849 9.9206152789297 = 1.718 normalized 2 = − 10.18016469 − ( − 4.58837568 ) 98.418607512533 + 𝜖 = − 5.59178901 9.9206152789297 = − 0.564 normalized 3 = − 8.59340253 − ( − 4.58837568 ) 98.418607512533 + 𝜖 = − 4.00502685 9.9206152789297 = − 0.404 normalized 4 = − 12.04387833 − ( − 4.58837568 ) 98.418607512533 + 𝜖 = − 7.45550265 9.9206152789297 = − 0.752 We’ll skip the calculations by hand for the second embedding. Let’s confirm with code! Let’s re-define our encoder_block function with this change def layer_norm(x, epsilon=1e-6): mean = x.mean(axis=-1, keepdims=True) std = x.std(axis=-1, keepdims=True) return (x - mean) / (std + epsilon) def encoder_block(x, WQs, WKs, WVs, W1, b1, W2, b2): Z = multi_head_attention(x, WQs, WKs, WVs) Z = layer_norm(Z + x) output = feed_forward(Z, W1, b1, W2, b2) return layer_norm(output + Z) layer_norm(Z + embedding) array([[ 1.71887693, -0.56365339, -0.40370747, -0.75151608], [ 1.71909039, -0.56050453, -0.40695381, -0.75163205]]) It works! Let’s retry to pass the embedding through the six encoders. def encoder(x, n=6): for _ in range(n): x = random_encoder_block(x) return x encoder(embedding) array([[-0.335849 , -1.44504571, 1.21698183, 0.56391289], [-0.33583947, -1.44504861, 1.21698606, 0.56390202]]) Amazing! These values make sense and we don’t get NaNs! The idea of the stack of encoders is that they output a continuous representation, z, that captures the meaning of the input sequence. This representation is then passed to the decoder, which will genrate an output sequence of symbols, one element at a time. Before diving into the decoder, here’s an image from Jay’s amazing blog post: Encoder and decoder You should be able to explain each component at the left side! Quite impressive, right? Let’s now move to the decoder. Decoder Most of the thing we learned for encoders will be used in the decoder as well! The decoder has two self-attention layers, one for the encoder and one for the decoder. The decoder also has a feed-forward layer. Let’s go through each of these. The decoder block receives two inputs: the output of the encoder and the generated output sequence. The output of the encoder is the representation of the input sequence. During inference, the generated output sequence starts with a special start-of-sequence token (SOS). During training, the target output sequence is the actual output sequence, shifted by one position. This will be clearer soon! Given the embedding generated by the encoder and the SOS token, the decoder will then generate the next token of the sequence, e.g. “hola”. The decoder is autoregressive, that means that the decoder will take the previously generated tokens and again generate the second token. Iteration 1: Input is SOS, output is “hola” Iteration 2: Input is SOS + “hola”, output is “mundo” Iteration 3: Input is SOS + “hola” + “mundo”, output is EOS Here, SOS is the start-of-sequence token and EOS is the end-of-sequence token. The decoder will stop when it generates the EOS token. It generates one token at a time. Note that all iterations use the embedding generated by the encoder. Note This autoregressive design makes decoder slow. The encoder is able to generate its embedding in a single forward pass while the decoder needs to do many forward passes. This is one of the reasons why architectures that only use the encoder (such as BERT or sentence similarity models) are much faster than decoder-only architectures (such as GPT-2 or BART). Let’s dive into each step! Just as the encoder, the decoder is composed of a stack of decoder blocks. The decoder block is a bit more complex than the encoder block. The general structure is: (Masked) Self-attention layer Residual connection and layer normalization Encoder-decoder attention layer Residual connection and layer normalization Feed-forward layer Residual connection and layer normalization We’re already familiar with all the math from 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. See the right side of the image below, you’ll see that all these blocks you already know (the right part): Transformer model from the original “attention is all you need” paper 1. Embedding the text The first text of the decoder is to embed the input tokens. The input token is SOS, so we’ll embed it. We’ll use the same embedding dimension as the encoder. Let’s assume the embedding vector is the following: 𝐸 = [ 1 0 0 0 ] 2. Positional encoding We’ll now add the positional encoding to the embedding, just as we did for the encoder. Given it’s the same position as “Hello”, we’ll have same positional encoding as we did before: i = 0 (even): PE(0,0) = sin(0 / 10000^(0 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0 i = 1 (odd): PE(0,1) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*1 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1 i = 2 (even): PE(0,2) = sin(0 / 10000^(2*2 / 4)) = sin(0) = 0 i = 3 (odd): PE(0,3) = cos(0 / 10000^(2*3 / 4)) = cos(0) = 1 3. Add positional encoding and embedding Adding the positional encoding to the embedding is done by adding the two vectors together: 𝐸 = [ 1 1 0 1 ] 4. Self-attention The first step within the decoder block is the self-attention mechanism. Luckily, we have some code for this and can just use it! d_embedding = 4 n_attention_heads = 2 E = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 1]]) WQs = [np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_query) for _ in range(n_attention_heads)] WKs = [np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_key) for _ in range(n_attention_heads)] WVs = [np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_value) for _ in range(n_attention_heads)] Z_self_attention = multi_head_attention(E, WQs, WKs, WVs) Z_self_attention array([[ 2.19334924, 10.61851198, -4.50089666, -2.76366551]]) Note Things are quite simple for inference. For training, things are a bit tricky. During training, we use unlabeled data: just a bunch of text data, frequentyl scraped from the web. While the encoder’s goal is to capture all information of the input, the decoder’s goal is to predict the most likely next token. This means that the decoder can only use the tokens that have been generated so far (it cannot cheat and see the next tokens). Because of this, we use masked self-attention: we mask the tokens that have not been generated yet. This is done by setting the attention scores to -inf. This is done in the original paper (section 3.2.3.1). We’ll skip this for now, but it’s important to keep in mind that the decoder is a bit more complex during training. 5. Residual connection and layer normalization Nothing magical here, we just add the input to the output of the self-attention and apply layer normalization. We’ll use the same code as before. Z_self_attention = layer_norm(Z_self_attention + E) Z_self_attention array([[ 0.17236212, 1.54684892, -1.0828824 , -0.63632864]]) 6. Encoder-decoder attention This part is the new one! If you were wondering where do the encoder-generated embeddings come in, this is their moment to shine! Let’s assume the output of the encoder is the following matrix [ − 1.5 1.0 − 0.8 1.5 1.0 − 1.0 − 0.5 1.0 ] In the self-attention mechanism, we calculate the queries, keys, and values from the input embedding. In the encoder-decoder attention, we calculate the queries from the previous decoder layer and the keys and values from the encoder output! All the math is the same as before; the only difference is what embedding to use for the queries. Let’s look at some code def encoder_decoder_attention(encoder_output, attention_input, WQ, WK, WV): # The next three lines are the key difference! K = encoder_output @ WK # Note that now we pass the previous encoder output! V = encoder_output @ WV # Note that now we pass the previous encoder output! Q = attention_input @ WQ # Same as self-attention # This stays the same scores = Q @ K.T scores = scores / np.sqrt(d_key) scores = softmax(scores) scores = scores @ V return scores def multi_head_encoder_decoder_attention( encoder_output, attention_input, WQs, WKs, WVs ): # Note that now we pass the previous encoder output! attentions = np.concatenate( [ encoder_decoder_attention( encoder_output, attention_input, WQ, WK, WV ) for WQ, WK, WV in zip(WQs, WKs, WVs) ], axis=1, ) W = np.random.randn(n_attention_heads * d_value, d_embedding) return attentions @ W WQs = [np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_query) for _ in range(n_attention_heads)] WKs = [np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_key) for _ in range(n_attention_heads)] WVs = [np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_value) for _ in range(n_attention_heads)] encoder_output = np.array([[-1.5, 1.0, -0.8, 1.5], [1.0, -1.0, -0.5, 1.0]]) Z_encoder_decoder = multi_head_encoder_decoder_attention( encoder_output, Z_self_attention, WQs, WKs, WVs ) Z_encoder_decoder array([[ 1.57651431, 4.92489307, -0.08644448, -0.46776051]]) This worked! You might be asking “why do we do this?”. The reason is that we want the decoder to focus on the relevant parts of the input text (e.g., “hello world”). The encoder-decoder attention allows each position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This is very helpful for tasks such as translation, where the decoder needs to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence. The decoder will learn to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence by learning to generate the correct output tokens. This is a very powerful mechanism! 7. Residual connection and layer normalization Same as before! Z_encoder_decoder = layer_norm(Z_encoder_decoder + Z_self_attention) Z_encoder_decoder array([[-0.44406723, 1.6552893 , -0.19984632, -1.01137575]]) 8. Feed-forward layer Once again, same as before! I’ll also do the residual connection and layer normalization after it. W1 = np.random.randn(4, 8) W2 = np.random.randn(8, 4) b1 = np.random.randn(8) b2 = np.random.randn(4) output = layer_norm(feed_forward(Z_encoder_decoder, W1, b1, W2, b2) + Z_encoder_decoder) output array([[-0.97650182, 0.81470137, -2.79122044, -3.39192873]]) 9. Encapsulating everything: The Random Decoder Let’s write the code for a single decoder block. The main change is that we now have an additional attention mechanism. d_embedding = 4 d_key = d_value = d_query = 3 d_feed_forward = 8 n_attention_heads = 2 encoder_output = np.array([[-1.5, 1.0, -0.8, 1.5], [1.0, -1.0, -0.5, 1.0]]) def decoder_block( x, encoder_output, WQs_self_attention, WKs_self_attention, WVs_self_attention, WQs_ed_attention, WKs_ed_attention, WVs_ed_attention, W1, b1, W2, b2, ): # Same as before Z = multi_head_attention( x, WQs_self_attention, WKs_self_attention, WVs_self_attention ) Z = layer_norm(Z + x) # The next three lines are the key difference! Z_encoder_decoder = multi_head_encoder_decoder_attention( encoder_output, Z, WQs_ed_attention, WKs_ed_attention, WVs_ed_attention ) Z_encoder_decoder = layer_norm(Z_encoder_decoder + Z) # Same as before output = feed_forward(Z_encoder_decoder, W1, b1, W2, b2) return layer_norm(output + Z_encoder_decoder) def random_decoder_block(x, encoder_output): # Just a bunch of random initializations WQs_self_attention = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_query) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] WKs_self_attention = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_key) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] WVs_self_attention = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_value) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] WQs_ed_attention = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_query) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] WKs_ed_attention = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_key) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] WVs_ed_attention = [ np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_value) for _ in range(n_attention_heads) ] W1 = np.random.randn(d_embedding, d_feed_forward) b1 = np.random.randn(d_feed_forward) W2 = np.random.randn(d_feed_forward, d_embedding) b2 = np.random.randn(d_embedding) return decoder_block( x, encoder_output, WQs_self_attention, WKs_self_attention, WVs_self_attention, WQs_ed_attention, WKs_ed_attention, WVs_ed_attention, W1, b1, W2, b2, ) def decoder(x, decoder_embedding, n=6): for _ in range(n): x = random_decoder_block(x, decoder_embedding) return x decoder(E, encoder_output) array([[ 0.71866458, -1.72279956, 0.57735876, 0.42677623]]) Generating the output sequence We have all the building blocks! Let’s now generate the output sequence. We have the encoder, which takes the input sequence and generates its rich representation. It’s composed of a stack of encoder blocks. We have the decoder, which takes the encoder output and generated tokens, and generates the output sequence. It’s composed of a stack of decoder blocks. How do we go from the decoder’s output to a word? We need to add a final linear layer and a softmax layer on top of the decoder. The whole algorithm looks like this: The encoder receives the input sequence and generates a representation of it. The decoder begins with the SOS token and the encoder output. It generates the next token of the output sequence. We then apply a linear layer to generate the logits. We then apply a softmax layer to generate the probabilities. The decoder uses the encoder output and the previously generated token to generate the next token of the output sequence. We repeat steps 2-5 until we generate the EOS token. This is mentioned in the section 3.4 of the paper. 1. Linear layer The linear layer is a simple linear transformation. It takes the decoder’s output and transforms it into a vector of size vocab_size. This is the size of the vocabulary. For example, if we have a vocabulary of 10000 words, the linear layer will transform the decoder’s output into a vector of size 10000. This vector will contain the probability of each word being the next word in the sequence. For simplicity, let’s go with a vocabulary of 10 words and assume the first decoder output is a very simple vector: [1, 0, 1, 0]. We’ll use random weights and biases matrices of the size vocab_size x decoder_output_size. def linear(x, W, b): return np.dot(x, W) + b x = linear([[1, 0, 1, 0]], np.random.randn(4, 10), np.random.randn(10)) x array([[-0.39929948, 0.96345013, 2.77090264, 0.25651866, -0.84738762, -1.67834992, -0.29583529, -3.55515281, 2.97453801, -1.10682376]]) 2. Softmax These are called logits but they are not easily interpretable. We need to apply a softmax function to obtain the probabilities. softmax(x) array([[0.01602618, 0.06261303, 0.38162024, 0.03087794, 0.0102383 , 0.00446011, 0.01777314, 0.00068275, 0.46780959, 0.00789871]]) This is giving us probabilities! Let’a assume the vocabulary is the following: vocab = [ hello mundo world how ? EOS SOS a hola c ] The above tells us that the probabilities are hello: 0.01602618 mundo: 0.06261303 world: 0.38162024 how: 0.03087794 ?: 0.0102383 EOS: 0.00446011 SOS: 0.01777314 a: 0.00068275 hola: 0.46780959 c: 0.00789871 From these, the most likely next token is “hola”. Picking always the most likely token is called greedy decoding. This is not always the best approach, as it might lead to suboptimal results, but we won’t dive into generation techniques at the moment. If you want to learn more about it, check out this amazing blog post. 3. The Random Encoder-Decoder Transformer Let’s write the whole code for this! Let’s define a dictionary that maps the words to their initial embeddings. Note that this is also learned during training, but we’ll use random values for now. vocabulary = [ \"hello\", \"mundo\", \"world\", \"how\", \"?\", \"EOS\", \"SOS\", \"a\", \"hola\", \"c\", ] embedding_reps = np.random.randn(10, 1, 4) vocabulary_embeddings = { word: embedding_reps[i] for i, word in enumerate(vocabulary) } vocabulary_embeddings {'hello': array([[-1.19489531, -1.08007463, 1.41277762, 0.72054139]]), 'mundo': array([[-0.70265064, -0.58361306, -1.7710761 , 0.87478862]]), 'world': array([[ 0.52480342, 2.03519246, -0.45100608, -1.92472193]]), 'how': array([[-1.14693176, -1.55761929, 1.09607545, -0.21673596]]), '?': array([[-0.23689522, -1.12496841, -0.03733462, -0.23477603]]), 'EOS': array([[ 0.5180958 , -0.39844119, 0.30004136, 0.03881324]]), 'SOS': array([[ 2.00439161, 2.19477149, -0.84901634, -0.89269937]]), 'a': array([[ 1.63558337, -1.2556952 , 1.65365362, 0.87639945]]), 'hola': array([[-0.5805717 , -0.93861149, 1.06847734, -0.34408367]]), 'c': array([[-2.79741142, 0.70521986, -0.44929098, -1.66167776]])} And now let’s write our random generate method that generates tokens autorergressively. def generate(input_sequence, max_iters=10): # We first encode the inputs into embeddings # This skips the positional encoding step for simplicity embedded_inputs = [ vocabulary_embeddings[token][0] for token in input_sequence ] print(\"Embedding representation (encoder input)\", embedded_inputs) # We then generate an embedding representation encoder_output = encoder(embedded_inputs) print(\"Embedding generated by encoder (encoder output)\", encoder_output) # We initialize the decoder output with the embedding of the start token sequence = vocabulary_embeddings[\"SOS\"] output = \"SOS\" # Random matrices for the linear layer W_linear = np.random.randn(d_embedding, len(vocabulary)) b_linear = np.random.randn(len(vocabulary)) # We limit number of decoding steps to avoid too long sequences without EOS for i in range(max_iters): # Decoder step decoder_output = decoder(sequence, encoder_output) logits = linear(decoder_output, W_linear, b_linear) probs = softmax(logits) # We get the most likely next token next_token = vocabulary[np.argmax(probs)] sequence = vocabulary_embeddings[next_token] output += \" \" + next_token print( \"Iteration\", i, \"next token\", next_token, \"with probability of\", np.max(probs), ) # If the next token is the end token, we return the sequence if next_token == \"EOS\": return output return output Let’s run this now! generate([\"hello\", \"world\"]) Embedding representation (encoder input) [array([-1.19489531, -1.08007463, 1.41277762, 0.72054139]), array([ 0.52480342, 2.03519246, -0.45100608, -1.92472193])] Embedding generated by encoder (encoder output) [[-0.15606365 0.90444064 0.82531037 -1.57368737] [-0.15606217 0.90443936 0.82531082 -1.57368802]] Iteration 0 next token how with probability of 0.6265258176587956 Iteration 1 next token a with probability of 0.42708031743571 Iteration 2 next token c with probability of 0.44288777368698484 'SOS how a c' Ok, so we got the tokens “how”, “a”, and “c”. This is not a good translation, but it’s expected! We only used random weights! I suggest you to look again in detail at the whole encoder-decoder architecture from the original paper: Encoder and decoder Conclusions I hope that was fun and informational! We covered a lot of ground. Wait…was that it? And the answer is, mostly, yes! New transformer architectures add lots of tricks, but the core of the transformer is what we just covered. Depending on what task you want to solve, you can also only the encoder or the decoder. For example, for understanding-heavy tasks such as classification, you can use the encoder stack with a linear layer on top. For generation-heavy tasks such as translation, you can use the encoder and decoder stacks. And finally, for free generation, as in ChatGPT or Mistral, you can use only the decoder stack. Of course, we also did lots of simplifications. Let’s briefly check which were the numbers in the original transformer paper: Embedding dimension: 512 (4 in our example) Number of encoders: 6 (6 in our example) Number of decoders: 6 (6 in our example) Feed-forward dimension: 2048 (8 in our example) Number of attention heads: 8 (2 in our example) Attention dimension: 64 (3 in our example) We just covered lots of topics, but it’s quite interesting we can achieve impressive results by scaling up this math and doing smart training. We didn’t cover training in this blog post as the goal was to understand the math when using an existing model, but I hope this provided strong foundations for jumping into the training part. I hope you enjoyed this blog post! You can also find a more formal document with the math in this PDF (recommended by HackerNews folks). Exercises Here are some exercises to practice your understanding of the transformer. What is the purpose of the positional encoding? How does self-attention and encoder-decoder attention differ? What would happen if our attention dimension was too small? What about if it was too large? Briefly describe the structure of a feed-forward layer. Why is the decoder slower than the encoder? What is the purpose of the residual connections and layer normalization? How do we go from the decoder output to probabilities?

I.e more parallelism which works out nice, but very restrictive since the attention formula is static.We arent going to see more progress until we have a way to generalize the compute graph as a learnable parameter. I dunno if this is even possible in the traditional sense of gradients due to chaotic effects (i.e small changes reflect big shifts in performance), it may have to be some form of genetic algorithm or pso that happens under the hood. reply logicchains 2 hours agoparent>The whole \"mystery\" of transformer is that instead of a linear sequence of static weights times values in each layer, you now have 3 different matrices that are obtained from the same input through multiplication of learned weights, and then you just multiply the matrices together. I.e more parallelism which works out nice, but very restrictive since the attention formula is static.That&#x27;s not it at all. What&#x27;s special about transformers is they allow each element in a sequence to decide which parts of data are most important to it from each other element in the sequence, then extract those out and compute on them. The big theoretical advantage over RNNs (which were used for sequences prior to transformers), is that transformers support this in a lossless way, as each element has full access to all the information in every other element in the sequence (or at least all the ones that occurred before it in time sequences). RNNs and \"linear transformers\" on the other hand compress past values, so generally the last element of a long sequence will not have access to all the information in the first element of the sequence (unless the RNN internal state was really really big so it didn&#x27;t need to discard any information). reply necroforest 11 hours agoparentprev> We arent going to see more progress until we have a way to generalize the compute graph as a learnable parameterThat&#x27;s a bold statement since a ton of progress has been made without learning the compute graph. reply nomel 10 hours agorootparentFrom my naive perspective, there seems to be a plateau, that everyone is converging on, somewhere between ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 level of performance, with some suspecting that the implementation of 4 might involve several expert models, which would already be extra sauce, external to the LLM.

You will have people doing design, doing simulations, researching material sourcing, creating CNC programs for manufacturing parts, sourcing tools and equipment, writing software, e.t.c. And when executing this plan, they would be open to feedback for anything missed, and can advise on how to proceed.The AI with above capability should be able to go out on the internet, gather respective data, run any soft of algorithms it needs to run, and perhaps after a month of number crunching on a cloud rented TPU rack produce step by step plan with costs on how to do all of that.

Why should AI be different? reply itishappy 9 hours agorootparentprevLLMs seem like the least efficient way to accomplish this. NAND gates, for example, are inherently 1-bit operators, but LLMs use more. If weights are all binary, than gradients are restricted to -1, 0, and 1, which doesn&#x27;t give you much room to make incremental improvements. You can add extra bits back, but that&#x27;s pure overhead. But all this is besides the real issue, which is that LLMs and NNs in general are inherently fuzzy; they guess. Computers aren&#x27;t, we have perfect simulators.Consider how humans design things. We don&#x27;t talk through every CPU cycle to convince ourself a design works, we use bespoke tooling.

Does the 2 in both vector mean something? Or, is it the entire set that makes it unique? reply dan-robertson 11 hours agoparentThe number reuse is just the author being a bit lazy. You could estimate how similar these vectors are by seeing if they point in similar directions or by calculating the angle between them. Here they are about 60° apart and somewhat the same direction, but a lot of this is that the author didn’t want to put in any negative numbers in the example so vectors end up being a bit more similar than they would be really.That the numbers are reused isn’t meaningful here: a 1 in the first position is quite unrelated to a 1 in the second (as no convolutions are done over this vector) reply dogline 10 hours agorootparentThank you. I guess I need to back up. This is a vector, not just an identifier, and direction and angle seem important. I need to look up how the encoding is normally done, since this isn&#x27;t obvious if you haven&#x27;t worked in this domain before. reply kevindamm 8 hours agorootparentThe encoding is typically learned, and if possible is part of the ANN so that it can be adjusted along with the other parameters.A good place to start on that topic is the word2vec paper. reply smaddox 10 hours agoparentprevThat isn&#x27;t a very good example.

Does anyone know where I can find articles &#x2F; papers that discuss why transformers, while acting as merely \"next token predictor\" can handle questions with: 1. Unknown words (or subwords&#x2F;tokens) that are not seen in the training dataset. Example: Create a table with \"sdsfs_ff\", \"fsdf_value\" as columns in pandas. 2. Create examples(unseen in training dataset) and tell the LLM to provide similar output.I have a feeling it should be a common question, but I just can&#x27;t find the keyword to search.PS.

I never got a satisfying answer about the usage of sine &#x2F; cosine and (multiplication vs addition) reply treyd 6 hours agoparentIf I had to guess, single characters are able to be encoded as tokens, but there&#x27;s more \"bandwidth\" in the model being dedicated to handling them and there&#x27;s less semantic meaning encoded in them \"natively\" compared to tokens for concrete words. If it decides to, it can recreate unknown sequences by copying over the tokens for the single letters or create them if it makes sense. reply heisenburgzero 6 hours agorootparentI think some earlier NLP applications have something called \"Unknown token\", which they will replace any unseen word.

These concepts exist in a high dimensional latent space. Within this space is the concept of nonsense&#x2F;gibberish&#x2F;placeholder, which your sequence of unseen tokens map to.

If so, what makes up the \"neuron\"? i.e. Is there a code structure that underlies the neuron, or is it \"just\" fancy math? reply osanseviero 11 hours agoparentJust math, and not even that fancy.Let&#x27;s say you want to predict if you&#x27;ll pass an exam based on how many hours you studied (x1) and how many exercises you did (x2). A neuron will learn a weight for each variable (w1 and w2). If the model learns w1=0.5 and w2=1, the model will provide more importance to the # of exercises.So if you study for 10 hours and only do 2 exercises, the model will do x1w1 + x2w2=10x0.5 + 2x1 = 7. The neuron then outputs that. This is a bit (but not much) simplified - we also have a bias term and an activation to process the output.Congrats! We built our first neuron together! Have thousands of these neurons in connected layers, and you suddenly have a deep neural network. Have billions or trillions of them, you have an LLM :) reply abrichr 11 hours agoparentprevThe “neuron” in a neural network is just a non linear function of the weighted sum of the inputs (plus a bias term).See the “definition” section in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Perceptron . reply dartos 11 hours agoparentprevTransformers can be considered a kind of neural network.It’s mainly fancy math.

A parameter is an expression, it&#x27;s a mathematical representation of a token and it&#x27;s probabilistic weighting (theyre translated from input or to output token lists entering and exiting the model). Usually tokens are pre-set small groups of character combinations like \"if \" or \"cha\" that make up a word&#x2F;sentence. The recorded path your value takes down the chain of probabilities would be the \"neural pathway\" within the wider \"neural network\".Someone please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong or my terminology is wrong. reply pmayrgundter 5 hours agorootparentThis is all true in a neutral net, but Transformers aren&#x27;t Neural Nets in the traditional sense. I was under that impression originally, but there&#x27;s not a back propagation or Hebbian learning here, which were the key bits of biomimicry that earned classic NNs their name.Transformers do have coefficients that are fit, but that&#x27;s more broad.. could be used for any sort of regression or optimization, and not necessarily indicative of biological analogs.So I think the terms \"learned model\" of \"weights\" are malapropisms for Transformers, carried over from deep nets because of structural similarities, like many layers, and the development workflow.The functional units in Transformer&#x27;s layers have lost their orginal biological inspiration and functional analog. The core function in Transformers is more like autoencoding&#x2F;decoding (concepts from info theory) and model&#x2F;grammar-free translation, with a unique attention based optimization. Transformers were developed for translation. The magic is smth like \"attending\" to important parts of the translation inputs&outputs as tokens are generated, maybe as a kind of deviation on pure autoencoding, due to the bias from the .. learned model :) See I can&#x27;t even escape it.Attention as a powerful systemic optimization is the actual closer bit of neuro&#x2F;bio-insporation here.. but more from Cog Psych than micro&#x2F;neuro anatomy.Btw, not only is attention a key insight for Transformers, but it&#x27;s an interesting biographical note that the lead inventor of it, Jakob Uzkereit, went on to work on a bio-AI startup after Google. reply kmmlng 37 minutes agorootparent> This is all true in a neutral net, but Transformers aren&#x27;t Neural Nets in the traditional sense.

Great work, so I don&#x27;t want it to be taken as I&#x27;m saying anything it isn&#x27;t.Why I hate these is that they are labeled as \"math behind\" but I think this is not quite fitting. This is the opposite of the complaint I made about the Introduction to DL post the other day[0]. The issue isn&#x27;t that there isn&#x27;t math, but contextually it is being labeled as a mathematical approach but I&#x27;m not seeing anything that distinguishes it as deeper than what you&#x27;d get from Karpathy&#x27;s videos or the Annotated Transformer (I like this more than illustrated). There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but just think it might mislead people, especially as there is a serious lack of places to find a much deeper mathematical explanation behind architectures and the naming makes it harder to find for those that are looking for that, because they&#x27;ll find these posts. Simply, complaint is about framing.To be clear, the complaint is just about the subtitle, because the article is good and a useful resource for people seeking to learn attention and transformers. But let me try to clarify some of what would I personally (welcome to disagree, it is an opinion) more accurately be representative of \" demystifying all the math behind them\":- I would include a much deeper discussion of both embedding and positional embedding. The former you should at minimum be discussion how it is created and discussing the dequantization. This post may give a reader the impression that this is not taking place (there is ambiguity between distinction of embedding vs tokenization and embedding, this looks to just briefly mention tokenization. I specifically think a novice might take away that the dequantization is happening due to the positional encoding, and not in the embedding). The tokenization and embedding is a vastly underappreciated and incredibly important aspect of making discrete models work (not just LLMs or LMs. Principle is more general).- Same goes for the positional embedding which I have only in a handful of cases seen discussed and taken rather matter of factly. For a mathematical explanation you do need to explain the idea behind generating unique signals for each position, explain why we need a a high frequency, and it is worth mentioning how this can be learnable (often with similar results, which is why most don&#x27;t bother), and other forms like rotational. The principle is far more general than even a Fourier Series (unmentioned!). The continuous aspect also matters a lot here, and we (often) don&#x27;t want discritized positional encoding. If this isn&#x27;t explained it feels rather arbitrary, and in some ways it is but others it isn&#x27;t.- The attention mechanism is vastly under-explained, though I understand why. There are many approaches to tackle this, some from graphs, some from category theory, and many others. They&#x27;re all valuable pieces to the puzzle. But at minimum I think there needs to be a clear identification as to what the dot product is doing, the softmax, the scale (see softmax tempering), and why we then have the value. Their key-query-value names were not chosen at random and the database analogy is quite helpful. Maybe many don&#x27;t understand the relationship of dot products and angles between vectors? But this can even get complex as we would expect values to go to 0 in high dimensions (which they kinda do if you look at the attention matricies post learning which often look highly diagonal and why you can initialize them as diagonally spiked for sometimes faster training). This would be a great place to bring up how there might be some surprising aspects to the attention mechanism considering matrices represent affine transformations of data (linear) and we might not see the non-linearity here (softmax) or understand why softmax works better than other non-linears or normalizers (try it yourself!).- There&#x27;s more but I&#x27;ve written a wall. So I&#x27;ll just say we can continue for the residuals (also see META&#x27;s 3 Things Everyone Should Know About Vision Transformers, in the Deit repo), why we have pre-norm as opposed to the original post-norm (which it looks like post norm is being used!), the residuals (knot theory can help here a bit), and why we have the linear layer (similarly the unknotting discussion helps, especially quantifying why we like a 4x ratio, but isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary).Idk, are people interested in these things? I know most people aren&#x27;t, and there&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with that (you can still build strong models without this knowledge, but it is definitely helpful). I do feel that we often call these things black boxes but they aren&#x27;t completely opaque. They sure aren&#x27;t transparent, especially through scale, but they aren&#x27;t \"black\" either.

Matrices and vectors just makes it harder to relate to what&#x27;s happening in the ANN.The way I&#x27;m used to writing ANNs, each input node is a scalar but the feed forward algorithm looks like vector-matrix multiplication since you multiply all the input nodes by the weights then sum them up...

Creating Puzzle Games with AI Chatbot Teaching Game Mechanics to AI Can AI Chatbots Create New Games? In Conclusion Published with HonKit AA SerifSans WhiteSepiaNight Making small games, which is fun in itself Making Small Games, Which Is Fun in Itself Creating small games is an enjoyable endeavor in itself. So what constitutes a small game? According to the 'Small Game Manifesto', 1 it refers to games that conclude within 10 minutes and can be easily played on browsers. By this definition, I have already created over 350 small games.2 There was a year when I crafted 139 of these small games,3 showcasing my undeniable love for them. Take for instance, a simple game where you slice a red stick into equal parts, which exemplifies a small game (click the image below to play directly in the browser). Another example is a game where you cut a rope with a tap, ensuring it doesn't touch the bottom of the screen, also a small game, enjoyable on touch panel devices like smartphones. The allure of small games lies in the abbreviated development time they require. A game could be quickly whipped up in about 2 hours, or within around 10 hours if met with challenges. However, once you start diving into artwork, the time investment can become endless. The small games discussed in this article are those produced under initiatives such as \"Game A Week,\"4 in which developers aim to produce a new game each week. These games, even from a developer's standpoint, are considered small due to the constrained time frame in which they are developed. The abbreviated development time means you can easily experiment with various ideas. I’ve enjoyed crafting and testing unconventional games. The common narrative surrounding small games posits that creating them is a crucial preparatory step towards developing larger, more polished games. Many articles overwhelmingly advise beginners to start with small games. A blog post titled \"Make and release lots of small games before making a big one\" 5 emphasizes the importance of this practice before embarking on larger projects. It's here because, jumping straight into a big game as your \"first\" game is exactly how you end up losing motivation and never finishing that game, or ending up with something that ate years of your life that you can't even stand looking at anymore. But the story doesn’t end there. Small games possess a unique charm exclusive to them. That's what I believe. There's a blog post titled \"How To Make Good Small Games\",6 elucidating that excellent small games do exist and detailing how to create them. This manifesto of sorts, “How to Make Good Small Games”, is an attempt to meet this perspective halfway. It’s divided into twelve thoughts, made up mostly of esoteric creative theory (why do I like small games? why do I like making small games?), and hopefully a little actionable advice. I can tell you “scope small uwu”, but if you don’t believe small games can be good in the first place, all you’ll hear is a homework assignment you have to do before you can make the games you really care about. The 12 thoughts encompass the following: A game’s quality is independent from its scale.: Small games are not only easy to create but also to make well. The larger the game, the more aspects within it need attention, and the higher the chance of failure. A game’s quality is independent from its emotional scope.: Just as short stories function differently from long novels or epics, the conditions constituting “success” vary in small-scale games. A game defines the terms of its own success.: Accept them as they are, and assess whether that's good or bad. A game succeeds when it fulfills its promises.: The introduction of new characters or mechanics is a promise. Instead of introducing an interesting idea and quickly abandoning it, ensure it evolves and contributes to the game's overall progression. It's easier for a game to succeed if it makes smaller promises.: Reduce the mechanics, enemies, assets, characters, and stages. It's easier to introduce three ideas and develop them to a satisfying climax than to juggle 10 or 100 ideas. Fulfill promises in an interesting and delightful way.: What makes you smile? This is where your personal style shines through in creating a game that feels authentically \"you\". Don’t over-deliver on your promises.: Games should conclude at the right moment, not extending unnecessarily. Form factor is a part of a game’s promises.: Minimize information presented to players, and ensure they can commence playing as soon as the game launches, altering player expectations. Finish your game before releasing it.: Before releasing under labels like “Demo” or subtitling it “Prologue”, question why you would wish to release it before completion. Serial games are not a shortcut.: Splitting the game into two or more episodes released over an extended period is almost always a bad idea. Don’t worry about going viral.: Pursuing small, specific goals in games also attracts a small, specific audience. Good is good enough.: Once you can consistently create games that satisfy you and feel genuinely good, you’re light-years ahead of many game developers. Additionally, the article in discussion presents a 13th thought: \"Have fun :)\". Conceptualize new mechanics and integrate them into your game in a manner that reflects your style. I find this process enjoyable, and it’s even more gratifying if a fair number of people experience and enjoy what I’ve created. Creating small games is often discussed within the context of honing game development skills. However, the process of brainstorming diverse game ideas, experimenting, riding the roller coaster of elation and disappointment, and occasionally showcasing your work to others is itself enjoyable, which is an invaluable experience. 1.

You need to iterate on design, and to do that you need to develop. Basically no professional game comes out as it was originally envisioned, and oftentimes a nearly complete version is tossed out because it just sucks too much. reply ugh123 9 hours agorootparentIn a more \"traditional\" software team or even medium sized studio, I think the two are a bit more specialized with individuals focusing on each, still with some influence on the other i&#x27;m sure. reply meheleventyone 2 hours agorootparentThey are but you’re still working together to make the same thing so the process is intertwined. This is also why you have several specializations for example gameplay engineer or technical designer on larger teams that bridge the gap. reply derefr 15 hours agoparentprev> hence imo in the beginning, it&#x27;s best to recreate existing games with atmost a small twist...if your goal is to do game development.If your goal is to do game design, though, then the place to start is making paper prototypes of your game mechanics.Almost anything turn-based can be prototyped on a tabletop with stuff you have lying around the house, and some rules about how you and your friends should move things.(For something like an RPG, you may want to write a few little calculator scripts for calculations the game would hide from the players, to run on a laptop at the table, just so everyone doesn&#x27;t get dragged down doing hours of math that wouldn&#x27;t actually be part of a player&#x27;s experience of the game. But \"a calculator script\" is still a far cry simpler than a game engine!)Reflex-based video games are harder to prototype, but can often be tested \"by analogy\" to physical-movement games. Think: testing a design for a new FPS, by designing the mechanics as a set of LARP-y mods over paintball&#x2F;airsoft&#x2F;lasertag.For a reflex-based video game where the player avatar is expected to be superhuman (e.g. most platformers&#x2F;adventure games), you might not be able to test the mechanics directly, but you can at least create paper rubrics — e.g. threat-radius circles for attacks. You can then do level design by building physical dioramas out of blocks (Lego — esp. Technics, to have parts of the diorama move — is great for this!) and then \"testing\" using your paper rubrics to ensure each course is at least possible. This isn&#x27;t so great an idea — unlike the previous prototyping strategies, this one won&#x27;t really indicate whether your game idea is fun to play — but it&#x27;s at least something you can do to iterate on an existing game concept without constantly having to program in each new marginal idea.The only kind of game that&#x27;s near-impossible to prototype without actually programming anything, is an \"artsy\" game where the mechanics play with lighting &#x2F; mirrors &#x2F; illusions &#x2F; etc. in a way that doesn&#x27;t line up with things that are physically possible in the real world. So... don&#x27;t try to design one of those as your first game. :) reply meheleventyone 14 hours agorootparentHaving tried to get on board with and use paper prototypes for digital games I’d largely disagree with this. Unless the mechanics are complementary to a board game then you’re largely not going to learn anything useful working this way. I’ve found that even in the case of digital games that do have good parity you learn a lot more as soon as you ditch paper and start working in the native format. With the reflex case this just gets worse, as the prototype medium gets ever further from any congruence to what you want to make.There’s just too much missing in what it feels like to play the game. From the affordances digital games have, to the feedback and automated book keeping. reply crq-yml 13 hours agorootparentI concur.Digital game design lends itself to working \"UI down\" instead of \"data model up\" because most of the feel of the game derives from the interface. This is even true if you look at something like Civilization. The first release of that game was primarily built off the feel of the city management - the stats of everything were given very basic tuning. It switched from real time to turn based relatively late in development.So paper can be used, but mostly in a storyboard kind of way where you&#x27;re presenting some interactions to testers without coding them up. You don&#x27;t have to have a full game loop at that stage - the loop is just a hook to stay engaged with those interactions.The reason why the spreadsheets are relevant now mostly comes down to games having more and more content that needs stat balancing. This was immediately true of Wizardry and derived RPGs, but it&#x27;s never been necessary for simple arcade games, and it&#x27;s obviously wrong if your aim is something like a Sokoban puzzle. reply derefr 12 hours agorootparent> Digital game design lends itself to working \"UI down\" instead of \"data model up\" because most of the feel of the game derives from the interface.You&#x27;re talking about a later stage of the ideation process than I am, I think.You seem to be talking about building a game in an established genre, where you know what kind of medium you&#x27;ll use, and even what game engine you probably need, and so you can sit down and start iterating on game design through development — with mechanics being either just retreads of other games&#x27; mechanics, or being things that naturally arise during development.If you work for a game studio that makes games in one particular medium and genre, then this approach makes sense, I suppose.But I was speaking more of ideating novel game mechanics: what you&#x27;re calling an \"interaction\", but a bit more — basically any element of a game&#x27;s concept that can be extracted out to be modelled separately as its own abstract rules state-machine, its own \"micro game.\"And I was speaking of these mechanics in isolation of any particular game engine, or even any particular medium — of any particular game genre.When designing such an isolated mechanic, you can use paper-prototyping to wrap the mechanic into a Minimal Viable Game — because your goal is testing whether the mechanic is fun, rather than whether the game is fun.Example: coming up with \"a sequence of random-chance events to either buy or trade for unclaimed properties, or to be taxed by the current owner of the property\" as a mechanic. Wrap it in a board game: it&#x27;s an MVP version of Monopoly. But you could just as well wrap it in an async MMO game — then you&#x27;ve got something more like Elite or Dope Wars or EVE Online.Monopoly and EVE Online are two very different games in two very different genres, with two very different playstyles — but before you design either game, you can determine whether the core mechanic between both of them is fun even in concept. If it isn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t bother putting it in a game at all.(For another 300 examples: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.squidi.net&#x2F;three&#x2F;)Games designed mechanics-first, are usually also designed mechanics out — which is similar to, but not the same as, \"data model up.\" Mechanics constrain possible UX and possible data models, but don&#x27;t fully determine either. And mechanics — or the particular combination of mechanics — determines a game&#x27;s genre. (Often, adding one more mechanic to an existing genre makes people start calling games like that a new subgenre. Add \"keys that fit multiple nonobvious earlier locks, incentivizing exploratory backtracking, with each key being qualitatively different in use\" to a platformer, and you&#x27;ve got a metroidvania.)So the goal of a game-designer who is designing mechanics-first, is almost always to create a game with a set of unique, innovative mechanics — i.e. to create a game that is the first entry in a new game genre.What mechanics-first design often doesn&#x27;t constrain, is medium. The same set of action-resolution and narrative-tension mechanics might work equally well in a CRPG or a TTRPG! The same set of competitive zero-sum character moveset concepts might translate equally well to a fighting game (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sirlin.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;balancing-puzzle-fighter) or a deckbuilding card game (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sirlin.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;designing-puzzle-strike)!Which is why paper prototyping often does work well for mechanics-first design: many mechanics can be evaluated for \"can it be fun even in concept\"-ness through a very turn-based, abstract, talk-y form of interaction with the mechanic. A collaborative hallucination of the mechanic.This lets you decide what random mechanic ideas you have stewing, you should bother to take the time to \"translate\" from their abstract-concept form, to something programmed. It also often allows you to find mechanics that \"fit\" together, even while they&#x27;re still abstract. An entire game-genre of interlocking mechanics might just \"click\" and come together on paper, before any real examples of it exist. Now you just have to design an actual game that has those mechanics &#x2F; is in that novel genre.---Bonus potential hot take: I hypothesize that Shigeru Miyamoto — not Nintendo as a whole, just Miyamoto — does mechanics-first design. It&#x27;s why no project he heads, or even greenlights, is ever just effectively a DLC&#x2F;content-pack for a previous game. Which is in turn why Nintendo continually leads the industry in their games being the first entries in new game genres; but it&#x27;s also why the newer Paper Mario games suck. And it&#x27;s why there&#x27;s never going to be a sequel to many people&#x27;s favorite Nintendo games: there&#x27;s just no clear thing to change about or add to the mechanics, that a whole new game&#x27;s worth of content could be derived from, without that game having so little to do with the original that it wouldn&#x27;t appeal to fans of the original.(Re: that last part, see also: why no Half-Life 3 or Portal 3. Those series are clearly founded on mechanics-driven design as well.) reply crq-yml 9 hours agorootparentAsk what a \"game mechanic\" is and you&#x27;ll get three different answers. Not even the authors of the \"MDA\" paper, which got everyone using that term, were consistent in their definition. I sometimes find myself using it, but it&#x27;s a widget.The way I actually do design now is by Venn diagram. At the core of the diagram lies themes, principles, beliefs, or the so-called \"design pillars\". The \"hook\" of all games that reach an audience lies in offering a coherent belief structure: \"I believe I&#x27;m doing this thing because it coheres with what I think the thing is about.\" And it doesn&#x27;t have to be \"about\" anything very weighty; a ball sport amounts to an excuse to play with a ball in a certain way. And it doesn&#x27;t have to be a popular belief, either. But it is a hard requirement that the game has this quality, because the alternative is that the player says \"I don&#x27;t know what this is about and why isn&#x27;t it more like this other game\". Game players still say that about successful games, but it&#x27;s because their belief structure doesn&#x27;t allow engagement with the core.What fills out the rest of the diagram, and the design, is the supporting expression of that belief. If you believe the game is about throwing and catching a ball, you need to introduce some equipment and rules. But the reason why the game remains compelling as a whole is down to whether or not those things are facilitating the intended kind of play, and the reason to have genres of game derives from the mode of expression shaping that engagement: some games have a lot of legible rules and stats, others hide everything behind audiovisual expression. It&#x27;s books vs movies, not action vs romance.Miyamoto&#x27;s training was in industrial design. That is, he brings \"toy\" qualities to video games. The way in which he designs follows from that: rather than exploring a core that is literary, like \"hubris\" or \"rebirth\", Mario&#x27;s play value is in the experience of running and jumping. Therefore, Mario&#x27;s world follows from providing elements that engage further with running and jumping - motives to progress, obstacles to face, abilities that change his relationship to those obstacles. And the direction of Nintendo as a whole, since he started working there, has been to make products tightly focused around toy concepts, with hardware platforms that allowed more experiments to take place. reply Aerroon 7 hours agorootparentThis is a very interesting way of looking at game design or design of anything that is entertaining. It nails so much stuff that&#x27;s cool.Pacific rim? Giant robots and giant monsters are cool! How can we tell a cool story about giant robots and monsters? reply adamrezich 10 hours agorootparentprevto the best of my understanding—but please correct me if I&#x27;m mistaken—Miyamoto is not, and never really has been, what we would traditionally call a \"game designer\"—from what I can tell from reading numerous interviews, both with him and others who worked with him over the years, he&#x27;s more like a Steve Jobs-type figure. he comes up with a broad interesting idea or set of ideas or even just general vibe, and then it&#x27;s up to the programmers (and probably game designers nowadays) to figure out how to turn those ideas into an actual game. then he sees what they&#x27;ve come up with and gives feedback; rinse and repeat until the game ships.with regards to paper prototyping though, while I believe it can be a useful tool in certain situations, I pretty strongly believe that its usefulness is being vastly oversold to aspiring video game designers, these days. the best use for paper prototyping is when the game you&#x27;re setting out to make strongly resembles an analog game—like a roguelite deckbuilder, or Fortune Street. but if you&#x27;re looking to create a design for a video game that truly embraces what&#x27;s unique about the medium—instead of just making a computer-adjudicated board game—then there really isn&#x27;t a better way to do it than just biting the bullet and prototyping the gameplay with code. in my opinion, the best-designed video games are not ones where the design was thought through to completion ahead of time before implementation began, but rather, ones where someone had an idea or two and sat down and started programming its implementation—prototype or otherwise—and the eventual design of the end product was discovered through playing around with the combinatoric outcomes of interesting rules and mechanics that interact in nontrivial and often unforeseeable ways, seeing what works and what doesn&#x27;t, seeing what&#x27;s interesting and what isn&#x27;t, and gradually arriving at something special and unique.many people disagree with my assessment here, because they want to believe that it&#x27;s possible to create a design for a video game that is unique and interesting and special, whole-cloth, without ever writing a single line of code. but how can that even be possible? the main things that separate video game design from analog game design are 1.) the computer adjudicating the rules, and 2.) the much faster feedback loop between action taken action and observed outcome, from the perspective of the player. these are qualities inherent to the medium. you can choose to ignore them and design a more or less perfectly paper-prototypable game... but, if that&#x27;s the case, perhaps you&#x27;d be better off designing a board game instead. just like how many AAA linear-narrative-focused games&#x27; narratives really would just work a lot better as a movie or TV series. now this isn&#x27;t always strictly true of course—roguelite deckbuilders are fun as hell, even though they&#x27;re generally very straightforward to paper-prototype. but again, of course these kinds of games lend themselves to paper prototyping, because they&#x27;re really just essentially digital board games. and if that&#x27;s all you ever want to make, then sure, go on ahead.but if you want to make something that embraces the qualities of the medium that make it stand apart from its contemporaries, then really, making a digital prototype is the only way to go. as a hackneyed example, consider Braid: its initial prototype had a functioning \"infinite rewind\" system, and its designer&#x2F;programmer implemented more or less every idea he had (including World 1, the final level)... but much of the rest of the mechanics (such as World 4&#x27;s \"current point in time for all other entities in the level = the player character&#x27;s x-position\") only came about—were arguably discovered—through the act of implementation, as opposed being done in advance of implementation. if whether or not Braid was made hinged upon the perceived success or failure of preliminary paper prototyping, then it&#x27;s quite likely it would never have been made.moreover, it is entirely possible to design a game through paper prototyping, and be reasonably satisfied with the design... only for you to then implement it and actually play it in the form of an actual video game, and find it to be underwhelming, unengaging, or otherwise completely unlike how you envisioned it with your abstracted paper prototype. for example, that page of 300 video game design ideas are likely mostly or entirely interesting at face value—but without being tested, are basically entirely meaningless. I just clicked on a random one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.squidi.net&#x2F;three&#x2F;entry.php?id=224 this is a cute idea, but without even testing it out myself at all I doubt it&#x27;s actually very good at all. but hey, maybe I&#x27;m wrong, maybe it&#x27;s the next Angry Birds, or something! I&#x27;m not faulting the author for posting it on their personal website, but really, it&#x27;s nothing more than just a wholly untested, spontaneous idea jotted down in a notebook. until said idea is put into practice in the form of a playable video game prototype, there&#x27;s no way of knowing whether it would actually be fun at all, or worthwhile to pursue developing further.but, to my point above: perhaps in building and testing a prototypical two-button FPS game, the designer might realize that their idea was utter garbage... except for some small aspect that they did not and could not foresee. perhaps it&#x27;s entirely incidental to the \"two-button FPS\" game idea. maybe it&#x27;s even just something as trivial as a bugged shader that produces undesired yet unexpectedly visually interesting output, or improperly-implemented movement mechanics that inspire a completely different, first-person-shooting-less idea for a game.conversely: if Vampire Survivors never existed, and you came to me with an idea for a single-stick no-button roguelite top-down shooter with barely-animated 2D sprites that look like they should be in a side-scroller instead, I would&#x27;ve thought your idea was mediocre at best, and not worth pursuing. but as it turns out, it&#x27;s a great idea for a game, one that ended up spawning a whole subgenre—and anyone can see the appeal for themselves, just by playing it for only a few short minutes!paper prototypes can be useful for designing certain parts of certain types of games, but I completely and vehemently disagree that they&#x27;re a useful tool for determining whether or not a broad, abstract video game design idea is worth pursuing further. reply greggman7 5 hours agorootparentI agree with you.I watched some students prototype a simple diplomacy type game on paper first, targeted at phones.

On the phone, people just stared at their screens, made choices entirely in isolation, no \"diplomacy\" what-so-ever. reply panzagl 13 hours agorootparentprevThe first release of Civilization was a board game. reply meheleventyone 12 hours agorootparentI don’t think the board game and the videogame are related other than sharing the name and the former acting as inspiration. replyfelipemnoa 15 hours agoparentprev>>Game Designing and Game Development are two very different thingsRight on. Took me a while to realize this. Game Design is the blue printing process of a game. Game Development is the actual building of the game. And Game Design is way harder than what I expected. reply hesdeadjim 13 hours agorootparentSo hard. As a programmer it’s so much easier to get deep in the tech and push off the ambiguous, frustrating, yet rewarding craft of designing content.I built half the content of a VR game I released a long while back with a friend, and the only thing that got me through it was listening to talks by John Cleese on the topic of creativity. My process could be summed up as: beat my head against a wall, make something okay-ish, get frustrated, try again and again, sleep on it, and eventually repeating that enough times results in awesome stuff.But I have a hard time calling it “fun” even with the luxury of 7 years of hindsight. reply hypertele-Xii 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m polar opposite - ideas coming out the wazoo, like on average 1 idea per day, after decades of research into game design, but I dread moving into production and programming. Not for lack of experience, as chief of infotech I brought business-grade software projects from whiteboard to screen, but talking to a computer is just tedious. So much plumbing. reply greggman7 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is super true. It&#x27;s why programmers like writing game engines. It&#x27;s relatively well defined all the parts needed so it feels like you&#x27;re making lots of progress when in reality you&#x27;re just re-inventing the wheel and not doing the truly hard part, the actual design and content creation. I&#x27;m super guilty of it myself. reply 3737hdhd7372 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah a lot of people think of game design as just being about brainstorming cool ideasBut in reality it’s actually a pretty technical job from what I’ve seenCan involve a lot of staring at spreadsheets and dealing with stats reply grantismo 11 hours agoparentprevSmall twists are great.

Ie how did you attract the first players? reply tarruda 15 hours agoparentprevI want to begin game development as a hobby, but I&#x27;m unsure where to start. I did follow through https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnopengl.com&#x2F; a few years ago, and while it was a very interesting experience, I imagine I would need to use an existing engine to be productive.Do you recommend any books and tutorials aimed at experienced programmers with 0 knowledge of game development&#x2F;design? reply GuB-42 12 hours agorootparentOpenGL is probably not the best way to start game dev. It is a bit too low level for that. I mean, OpenGL is awesome, and a great way to learn graphics programming, but if you intend to make a game that is fun to play, it is easy to get lost in technicalities.When I started with Blitz Basic, not only my productivity skyrocketed, but I also made better games, because I actually thought about gameplay, not about getting the maths right. Blitz Basic is a game-oriented variant of the Basic programming language, very simple and straightforward. You can try it if you want, but it is two decades old, so I don&#x27;t know how well it aged. But the important part is to have something simple that can free you from technical details and boilerplate, it can be an engine.That&#x27;s unless you want to practice with the technical details, but doing that, the output will probably be more demo than game. And by the way, if you are into that you should check the demoscene, it is awesome. reply krapp 15 hours agorootparentprevJust start with a framework like Godot. There are plenty of tutorials online.If you really want to go low level with it, though, my personal sweet spot is C, Lua&#x2F;LuaJIT and SDL2. Although practically speaking C++ is probably better. reply alectroem 15 hours agorootparentI would highly recommend starting with a fantasy console such as Pico-8 or TIC-80. They remove the temptation to start by building a game engine from scratch, and instead help you focus on actually creating games! Plus they have great communities, complete docs, and simple apis. reply krapp 14 hours agorootparentYeah, one of the traps I find myself falling into a lot is that the act of writing code itself can be satisfying enough, and fear (of finishing, complexity and failure) can lead to just spinning your wheels for a long time. reply tarruda 15 hours agorootparentprevI will keep that in mind, thanks.My initial research suggest that Godot games are written in C#. Since you use C&#x2F;SDL2, do you code directly your own OpenGL engine? reply PsylentKnight 13 hours agorootparent> My initial research suggest that Godot games are written in C#There are a few supported languages (including a custom Python-like language called GDScript).

I probably should, and this year I&#x27;m planning on getting into Blender and 3D (but through Godot) but everything I do in SDL is 2d and sprite based, and SDL handles pushing the triangles&#x2F;quads on its own.Also, Godot games are also written in its native scripting language (GDScript) and it supports other languages, although I don&#x27;t know how well, or how up to date anything is. reply hypertele-Xii 4 hours agorootparentprevI can consult you on that subject if you want to chat. reply SushiHippie 10 hours agoparentprevFYI the layout is completely mangled on firefox on android :(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;pJGYF9S reply adamrezich 12 hours agoparentprevthere&#x27;s both pros and cons to both punching above and below one&#x27;s weight, in terms of programming ability. I learned a great deal from working on overly-ambitious projects—both what to do, and, more importantly, what not to do—but it wasn&#x27;t until much later that I learned the value of making something that seemed, to me, to be \"well below my skill level\". these days, I can&#x27;t advocate strongly enough for programmers, especially aspiring game developers, to first set out to do as you say and recreate a simple, already existing game first, then play around with modifying its rules, making its presentation more spiffy, and so on.people often get enamored with success stories like, \"well, [indie game you&#x27;ve heard of] was the first game project [creator] ever worked on, and he spent years working on it and nothing else, and now it&#x27;s popular and successful and everyone you know has heard of it, so why shouldn&#x27;t I just go about things the same way?\" well sure, you can try to go about things the same way, but there&#x27;s very, very little guarantee of success in doing things that way—not just in terms of sales or popularity, but in terms of even just actually finishing making what you set out to make. it&#x27;s often surprising just how much work it takes to implement everything necessary—even for a seemingly very simple, minimal game—and going through the process of figuring out what is needed to make it, and then making it, is an absolutely invaluable learning tool.this is especially true if you&#x27;ve never done any sort of game design before. some people like to make video games by \"paper prototyping\" first, and while this is certainly an option, I find that the best, most interesting games are made by a programmer or team of programmers who have an idea, start formalizing said idea into code, and then sort of \"discover\" the rest of the game&#x27;s design by exploring the possibility space that the formalized initial design idea provides, by playtesting and writing more code.but all of this is a lot easier once you have a few finished small game projects under your belt, and learned some of the basic game development insights along the way. reply 8organicbits 16 hours agoprevThe quick-to-build game model is quite fun.

Another interesting constraint of this particular game is that unlike Scrabble there&#x27;s a lot of accidental word discovery, which can create a poor user experience if a bunch of obscure words clear and ruin a player&#x27;s intended word.P.S.

What would be the point? That&#x27;s just a really good way to get caught.> Then you talk about \"discovered and revealed vulnerabilities\".Yes, that&#x27;s right. While it is theoretically possible for all your pen testers to be working together maliciously, if you are careful in your employment practices you can make this highly unlikely.As such, if your data shows that 100% of all known vulnerabilities were independently discovered by multiple testers, then there is reasonable confidence that any malicious actor&#x27;s failure to disclose a vulnerability will still be reported by someone else.But if that figure is less than 100%, and especially if it is considerably less than 100%, then there is much more doubt cast on another pen tester in your organization&#x27;s ability to find the same vulnerability.

I do. I have spoken with DanG about this before and he seemed fine with it.Yes, you should assume that the moderators will know, and you should be fine with them knowing, because you’re not using the multiple accounts to escape moderation, but rather for greater anonymity in the comment thread.The rules that I follow, which I think are implicit in “use good judgment”:1. Don’t vote on the same thing from multiple accounts.2. Don’t participate in the same comment thread with multiple accounts (or if you do, only separate parts of the thread). Don’t create a fake impression of consensus or have your accounts interact with each other.Those are probably the two big ones I would imagine.Whether the accounts are actually tied together on the backend, I don’t know.

No changes to requirements that I&#x27;m aware of when legally changing your name, but that&#x27;s not the step I&#x27;m talking about...the exploitable mechanic here is in socially-engineering the hiring manager.Two approaches:The more confusing you make the results of your background check, the less apparent relevance the criminal conviction for Jimmy Deere will have for Jane Doe.

He doesn&#x27;t have time to unfuck your fuckary.So when changing your name, pick one from the local obituaries or the name of a former resident of your home. Even better is if you share a name with another known criminal.

There are terrible employees out there who don&#x27;t break the law. If we&#x27;re so concerned about employers hiring bad employees then state should instead build a centralised database of bad employees and their reason for termination at previous places of work. I&#x27;d argue this would be more effective if we&#x27;re concerned an employer might hire a bad employee.Secondly, making it difficult for those who have committed crimes to get back into the workforce increases their risk of reoffending. Having a good job and a nice life to lose is a great reason to not commit crimes while having nothing to live for is a great excuse to do whatever feels right in the moment.Best of luck op.

Violence has no place in our world.I won’t even hire former cops.

Someone attacks you, a family member, etc. You defend yourself to protect your own life or that of a loved one. A cellphone video records the end of the encounter where you appear to be the aggressor.You get an assault charge.You work your ass off, beat a variety of odds, and make something of yourself. Many years later you’re passed over for a position simply because you came from an environment the person doing the hiring can’t possibly fathom. A person who has clearly never been in the position of “it’s me&#x2F;my wife&#x2F;my child or them”.Same for ex-military. Are you aware that the United States military is often considered to be the “only way out” for a substantial portion of the enlisted? That something like 90% of military roles are non-combat related?I’m not a violent person either but this is an extremely naive, judgmental, and downright discriminatory position. reply sneak 8 hours agorootparentIt is definitionally judgemental and discriminatory. Hiring is the practice of discriminating against undesirable hires by using one’s judgement.We can discuss whether or not it’s naive, but it’s served me quite well for decades thus far. The rest of your comment seems like a simple emotional appeal.All hiring is discriminatory; there are more applicants than there are positions. Discrimination is not a bad thing, it’s just discrimination based on built-in traits (race, sex, national origin, etc) that is bad.Discriminating in hiring based on the adult decisions of a human being is not only in-bounds, it is literally the whole of hiring. Some people studied software, some didn’t. Some dropped out of high school to start companies, some went to university.This is one of the reasons I think religious discrimination shouldn’t be prohibited in hiring (choice of religion is not a built in trait, but a choice made as an adult). Same with work history - going to work for the armed forces is an unforced choice.This sort of categorization and discrimination is a great and useful thing and we should do more of it. People are not interchangeable.You could make the exact same argument against hiring from the ivys versus community colleges, yet I don’t see anyone arguing for blinding of university names on CVs, or hiding the fact of whether or not someone studied at university.When hiring our job is to find the best possible candidate. It’s not wrong or bad to use all available data to do that.

People are also involuntarily conscripted into the military in some countries (like South Korea and Switzerland).If you want to argue that it \"doesn&#x27;t count\" when you&#x27;re a kid or something similar, then you&#x27;ll have to also explain way a child can change to become less violent or \"less religious\" and why an adult, for some reason, cannot.So yes, your opinion is naive.

No, they are there mostly to (poorly) investigate property crimes against the ownership class.

For security-critical software, such as password managers, this can easily lead to catastrophic failure: In this blog post, we show how Bitwarden’s Windows Hello implementation allowed us to remotely steal all credentials from the vault without knowing the password or requiring biometric authentication. When we discovered this during a penetration test it was so unexpected for us that we agreed with our client to publish a blog post about it and tell the story. The underlying issue has been corrected in Bitwarden v2023.4.0 in April 2023 (but the story is interesting nonetheless). Where We Started We recently conducted a penetration test with the goal of compromising the internal network of a client in a Windows environment. As usual, we managed to get administrative access to the domain controller, however, there was an additional hurdle: The backup server, one of the prioritized targets, did not reside within the domain. Having already gained access to Domain Administrator accounts, we decided to take a look around their Windows workstations in the hopes of uncovering information that would grant us access to the backup system. Looking at the workstations, we found that passwords seemed to be stored using Bitwarden (the following details apply to Version Desktop v2023.3.0 of the software). We made the assumption that credentials to the backup system might be found in the Bitwarden vault of the employees in charge of the IT infrastructure. After consulting with our client, we got the permission to attempt to retrieve the contents of one of these vaults. Since we did not want to potentially disrupt the client’s business by using invasive techniques such as key loggers to obtain access to the backup system, we looked for an unintrusive way without relying on end user interaction if possible. We first tried to crack the vault using simple credential stuffing attacks, however this remained unsuccessful, leading us to ultimately attempt a more creative approach. To further analyze the vault, we decided to download the main storage file of Bitwarden, in the hopes of finding anything of note. It is located under the user’s home directory at %AppData%\\Bitwarden\\data.json. Downloading the JSON file and opening it in a text editor already revealed an unexpected finding: \"openAtLogin\": false, \"enableBiometrics\": true, \"biometricText\": \"unlockWithWindowsHello\", \"noAutoPromptBiometricsText\": \"autoPromptWindowsHello\", \"installedVersion\": \"2023.3.0\", [...]\"avatarColor\": null,\"biometricUnlock\": true }, \"tokens\": { It seemed that this Bitwarden vault could be opened using Biometrics, and Windows Hello in particular. We had the feeling that it might be worth looking at, so we decided to dig deeper. Biometric Unlock - How Does it Work? Even if biometrics are enabled, the vault still has a main password (Bitwarden calls it master password), you simply do not have to always enter it to unlock the vault. This begs the question how the vault is secured if you do not have to enter the master password. Well, the vault is not really encrypted with the master password, but with an account encryption key, which is itself stored in encrypted form within the vault. The key to decrypting the account encryption key is derived from the main password chosen during vault creation. In other words: When a user enters their main password, Bitwarden derives a key from the password and this key is then used to decrypt the actual account encryption key which in turn can decrypt the credentials stored in the vault. The key derived from the main password will be called derived key from now on and it is exactly where the biometric unlock comes into play. At this point, users can choose to add additional unlock mechanisms, which usually results in an encrypted copy of the derived key being stored at a (hopefully) safe location from which it can be retrieved using biometrics, for example. As a result, whoever can retrieve and decrypt the derived key does not need a password to access the vault. The already described Biometric unlock is implemented based on Windows Hello on Windows machines. Consequently, activating biometric login on Windows means that the derived key is encrypted locally using a secret which can be retrieved after authentication via Windows Hello. So far so good, but as it turns out, it is very much worthwhile to take a closer look into how this is actually implemented in Bitwarden. After some digging, we found that Bitwarden stored the encrypted copy of the derived key using the Windows Credentials API by calling windows::win32::Credentials::CredWriteW in the bitwarden/clients Rust code. Unfortunately, the documentation on how these credentials are protected is meager, to say the least, which makes it complicated to actually understand what is happening when the API is used. It seems, as though CredWriteW creates credentials using the Credential Manager, which in turn seems to invoke the lower-level Data Protection API (DPAPI). DPAPI provides a convenient way to store data securely such that only the given user is able to retrieve the data at a later point in time. The differences between protecting credentials via the Credential Manager and DPAPI are somewhat unclear, however using the Credential Manager seems to provide additional benefits over using the low-level API, for example UI visibility (you can test this yourself by searching for the Credential Manager application in you Windows Start menu). So in order to decrypt the Bitwarden vault, we either need to know the main password in order to derive the derived key on-the-fly or we need to retrieve the derived key from the depths of the encrypted DPAPI storage. We knew that DPAPI has a lot of ties to the Active Directory that are relevant for domain-joined workstations and we had already compromised the client’s Active Directory, so we chose the latter approach. Robbing the Vault Remotely - Who Needs a Master Password, Anyway? We soon learned about an awfully convenient feature of DPAPI, or rather its newer version DPAPI-NG on domain-joined workstations: Normally, domain users encrypt DPAPI-protected data using keys that are derived from their own passwords. However, if the user forgets their password, or if their password is administratively reset or reset from another device, the previously encrypted data can no longer be decrypted using the new keys derived from the user’s new password. When this occurs, the data can still be decrypted using the Backup keys stored on the Active Directory domain controllers. They can then be re-encrypted with the user’s new password-derived key. This means that anyone who has the DPAPI Backup keys for a domain will be able to decrypt DPAPI-encrypted data for any domain user, even after the user’s password is changed. This means for one that the data is encrypted using the password of the domain user and no direct involvement of Windows Hello is needed to decrypt it (as long as the user’s password is known). Furthermore, the data can additionally be decrypted with a remote backup key stored on the domain controller. What could possibly go wrong? Since the workstation running Bitwarden was domain-joined and the domain was already compromised, we began hunting for DPAPI keys in order to exploit this mechanism. First, we need to obtain whatever DPAPI stores on the machine itself. We quickly found that two directories were of particular relevance to us: %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Protect, which is used to securely store the DPAPI decryption keys, and %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Credentials, where the protected data resides. Note, that we use some simplifications involving the creation of session keys in DPAPI since they are of no relevance to this blog post; details are available here. If you open these directories in the Explorer, you won’t see anything because they are hidden in a way that Explorer won’t even show them when “Show hidden files” is enabled. However, the PowerShell command Get-ChildItem or gci can display them when adding --force or --hidden.

This also means that we don’t have to wrestle with endpoint protection and we don’t need to wait for the actual user to unlock the vault. We simply have to use DPAPI as it was designed. We seriously doubt any user is aware of these implications when enabling Windows Hello for their vault. So far we only have shown the derived/biometric key, which is sufficient to decrypt the vault. In practice, however, there is still a little legwork we have to do. After all, our goal was not to demonstrate that we could decrypt the vault but to get actual credentials from the vault. Breaking Into the Vault We first had to figure out how to decrypt the Bitwarden account encryption key, which protects all other information in the vault. Credentials are not always encrypted with the account encryption key directly since Bitwarden also supports usage scenarios where some credentials should be shared in an organization, for example. This is solved by adding additional layers of keys (private and organizational keys), which are used to encrypt organization credentials, and are also protected using the account encryption key. Take a look at the figure below if you are starting to get confused about all the keys involved in this story. The decryption process therefore consists of three main steps: (1) Decryption of the account encryption key using the biometric key, (2) decryption of the second layer of keys using the account encryption key and (3) decryption of the credentials using either the account encryption key or one of the intermediate keys. We then set out to write a Python script to automate the decryption. Let’s walk through each step: We started by extracting the user object from the Bitwarden data file data.json. The user object contains the encrypted credentials (in the data section) and the encryption keys (in the keys section), in addition to (unencrypted) information about the user account like the email address (profile), settings like the online vault URL (settings) and more. The user section can be identified by searching for a UUID which is used as key in the JSON object: \"ea0b6061-4381-4534-9e91-50cf98753530\": { \"data\": { [...] \"keys\": { \"cryptoSymmetricKey\": { \"encrypted\": \"2.Z9+7NUlzujEYKrRX+x22+A==|rB5YmxVMKo9tJtNSmRT8mpVQu7GEAHhKndJBXKBwWfW1rw6i3x003ZPligtJCmWXpdHIryF2fb5KdETAvr9QLws27A8z3ZAO4KNAgrzGH14=|PuD7z8am9+l09gM8SDFUU8hvFa02x30gYqJXe7Ac6mI=\" }, [...] Since Bitwarden uses different types of encryption for different scenarios, all encrypted values are stored using a particular format, which starts with an encryption type identifier (from GitHub): export enum EncryptionType { AesCbc256_B64 = 0, AesCbc128_HmacSha256_B64 = 1, AesCbc256_HmacSha256_B64 = 2, Rsa2048_OaepSha256_B64 = 3, Rsa2048_OaepSha1_B64 = 4, Rsa2048_OaepSha256_HmacSha256_B64 = 5, Rsa2048_OaepSha1_HmacSha256_B64 = 6, } /** [...] * Example of annotated serialized EncStrings: * 0.iv|data * 1.iv|data|mac * 2.iv|data|mac * 3.data * 4.data [...] As indicated by the leading 2, our account encryption key was encrypted using AES-CBC-256, and integrity-protected using an HMAC based on SHA-256.

In our test setup, the private RSA key could be used to decrypt additional organizational keys, which were in turn required to access organization-specific credentials.

You can probably imagine the astonishment of our client when we told them about the attack, as they had no idea that domain admins can bypass Bitwarden’s vault protections. Well, we’ve always known attackers with domain admin privileges are quite powerful in the first place, but at least the vault is protected against unprivileged attackers on the local workstation, right? …right? But Wait, There’s More: Who Needs Biometrics, Anyway? In the process of trying to understand this whole mechanism, we started playing around with DPAPI in our lab setup. For example, we thought that using the API itself is probably easier than cobbling together the key files from %AppData%. To familiarize ourselves with DPAPI, we wrote a tiny Go program to see what credentials are stored in DPAPI on the workstation using the wincred library. The full script is available here, but the only interesting lines are these: creds, err := wincred.List() if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\"wincred list: %w\", err) } for _, cred := range creds { credentialBlob, err := decodeUTF16LE(cred.CredentialBlob) if err != nil { credentialBlob = fmt.Sprintf(\"%q\", string(cred.CredentialBlob)) }fmt.Printf(\"%s: * %s\", cred.UserName, credentialBlob) } It only calls windcred.List() which is a thin Go wrapper around CredEnumerateW which simply “enumerates the credentials from the user’s credential set”. However, we did not expect that this function immediately spits out Bitwarden’s derived/biometrics key without prompting for biometric authentication using Windows Hello: This means that any process that runs as the low-privileged user session can simply ask DPAPI for the credentials to unlock the vault, no questions asked and no PIN or fingerprint prompt required and Windows Hello is not even involved at all. The only caveat is that this does not work for other user accounts. Bitwarden itself does prompt for biometric authentication when unlocking the vault, but it wouldn’t even have to. In fact, you could probably remove a few lines from the source code and have it unlock without a prompt. The whole issue is likely a result of misunderstanding the details of the CredWriteW function, or maybe an unawareness of the potential pitfalls of using DPAPI to store encryption keys. A Feature, Not a Bug We contacted both Bitwarden and Microsoft about the details of this attack. We always make sure to follow industry best practices for responsible disclosure, even if it is unclear whether our findings are actual vulnerabilities. For the attack explained in this blog post, this was the case as it is not clear whether the attack is in scope of either Bitwarden (since the attack already assumes access to the workstation of the victim and the Windows domain) or Microsoft (who are only involved by providing DPAPI to store the decryption keys). Microsoft indeed responded to our report by stating that DPAPI and its backup mechanism were used exactly as intended, and that our attack therefore did not indicate any vulnerabilities on their side. Bitwarden also responded, however they agreed that this behavior was unintended, and stated that they were already tracking a similar issue internally. As it turns out, we were not the first to discover this in March 2023, it had already been reported to Bitwarden through HackerOne. However, we did not know this since it was only disclosed in June 2023. Since then the vulnerability is known as CVE-2023-27706. Bitwarden has since made changes to their codebase to mitigate this particular scenario, which we will quickly summarize in the next section. They have also changed the default setting when using Windows Hello as login feature to require entering the main password at least once when Bitwarden is started. Biometrics in Bitwarden Now To prepare for this blog post, we also took a look at how credentials are stored in the current version of Bitwarden Desktop v2023.10.1. Bitwarden still makes use of Windows Hello and DPAPI, which are still accessible using the domain backup key.

I recently came across a python script on GitHub that allows to decrypt passwords the browser stores locally in their %Appdata% directory. Many attacks could be prevented if access to %Appdata% was more restricted.I also found a post of an admin a few days ago where he asked if there was a Windows setting for disallowing any access to %Appdata%. The response was that if access to %Appdata% is completely blocked Windows won&#x27;t work anymore. reply zelon88 16 hours agoparent\"AppData\" is where user specific application data is supposed to be stored.\"The Registry\" is where application configuration is supposed to be stored.\"ProgramData\" is where application specific data is supposed to be stored.\"Program Files\" is where read-only application binaries and code is supposed to be stored.It really is a simple concept from a Windows perspective. What ruins everything is overzealous and&#x2F;or ignorant programmers who don&#x27;t take any pride in their work, or lack all respect for the users environment. For example; an .ini file should not be a thing in Windows. That is what the registry is for. But the programmer writes the code for Linux, half-ass ports it to Windows, and leaves the .ini file because his code is more important to him than the end-users operating system.There is nothing wrong with AppData permissions. The problem is with the users understanding of what it is for, and the developers understanding of how it should be used. reply EvanAnderson 15 hours agorootparentAs a Windows sysadmin AppData has been an unmitigated shit show forever.Developers (including those inside Microsoft) don&#x27;t give a damn about how Microsoft intends anything to work, and AppData has become a dumping ground of software installs to end-run IT departments. A lot of malware dumps into there but good luck limiting execution from that directory hierarchy because all your business-critical end user communication apps live there now too.The functionality of roaming users profiles (i.e. registry settings \"following\" you to a different computer, which gives a really slick user experience when it works) was completely ruined by devs dumping piles of small files into \"AppData\\Roaming\" (and completely not understanding that \"AppData\\Local\" even exists, let alone what it&#x27;s for).In Windows 2000-land you could redirect AppData to a UNC path and mostly get around this behavior. That&#x27;s not really \"a thing\" anymore because you&#x27;ve got apps like Microsoft Teams storing sizable databases in these locations and getting really, really cranky if network connectivity is interrupted.Windows development betrays its legacy DOS parentage even for devs who never lived thru that era. There were no rules. There was no adult supervision. There was poor documentation of APIs so you just hacked something together that worked well-enough.

It is a terrible structure, it does cause problems, but, that&#x27;s the conditions you work under while using windows. It&#x27;s mostly OK in practice, but as bitwarden found out, there are conditions that developers have to account for if you require security and safety.And factually, your presumed solution of \"put things in the right place\" is doubly broken, because if one acquires the correct privileges, there is no location on a windows machine where cleartext data is safe. The solution is not \"store it in the correct location\" the solution is to encrypt sensitive data at rest, regardless of location, which is more or less what bitwarden did. That&#x27;s the correct strategy, and it&#x27;s operating system agnostic. reply calamari4065 11 hours agorootparentAgreed. The windows registry needs to be killed with fire.There&#x27;s no appreciable difference between the registry and a directory of config files except that instead of an INI parser you have to use the much, much worse WIN32 API.Editing config files is fairly safe and user-intuitive. Sure you can break something by writing the wrong config file, but you do not risk breaking everything.

Yet we accept this security model on our desktops. reply pixl97 9 hours agorootparentWe accept it on the desktop because the desktop app model is from before the internet.

In addition desktop applications are based around the ability to read the users data files. Desktop users typically want all their excel files accessed, along with any embedded images from anywhere in their user directory.For the most part the changes you&#x27;d want to implement for security would ruin the productivity most of the workflows desktop users have these days, and would take a massive amount of refactoring to get to work anywhere close to what they do now. reply lxgr 1 hour agorootparentThere’s a difference between reading user data (i.e. “My Documents”) and reading other apps’ application data (e.g. Firefox’s cookie jar).macOS has started disallowing the latter (i.e. restricting access to other sandboxed apps’ files from both sandboxed and unsandboxed apps) more than a decade after the OS was introduced, yet I don’t feel like my productivity has been ruined. reply thereddaikon 13 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft themselves don&#x27;t understand that.

(Yes, yes-- there is tooling in Group Policy Preferences for dealing with INI files. It fails spectacularly on malformed INI files. It has never been reliable in my experience.)The idea of a centralized grammatically-accessible configuration store was a good idea (albeit this isn&#x27;t want the registry was \"for\" originally-- it was just a file-type registry originally). GConf was a similar idea.Devs misusing the registry to store opaque binary values (especially gigantic ones), accessing it with too high a velocity, and having a less-than-stellar file format have hurt it, for sure.

Like, beyond moronic design.Everything, and I mean everything, about a program should be in a single folder structure and the OS should by-default lock that application to only accessing it’s own folder unless otherwise granted permission (in a centrally auditable&#x2F;revocable location).Applications&#x2F;ExampleApp&#x2F;Should contain everything, and deleting it there should clean it as if it was never installed. If it needs to access something in documents&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;etc, the OS should ideally present a file picker to pass in a copy, but applications could request access to a specific path if absolutely necessary. You should also be able to “save to desktop” without the application having read&#x2F;write access to the desktop&#x2F;documents.“Exporting” is the application taking the local copy nested in Applications&#x2F;ExampleApp&#x2F; and passing it to a system save dialog, then the OS can store the file (therefore having permissions) wherever the user wishes in an context menu that’s outside the application’s control (it’s the OS).The idea that every installed application has wide-open filesystem access to say, all my documents, by default is pure insanity. reply thereddaikon 13 hours agorootparentThat makes managing a user&#x27;s application specific data difficult though. For one you have different user&#x27;s data intermingling which potentially causes new problems. But on top of that you make managing and backing up that data more difficult.

It&#x27;s ridiculous that it still is that dangerous after decades of desktop computing and the only way to avoid this is anti-virus heuristics.All we want is to get rid of the possibility of an application developer including evil code.We could have a fully interpreted language layer running on a platform that never lets application code touch the file system. How do applications do fast stuff like GUI then? You just have a package manager with libraries that can do low-level stuff but are vetted so they don&#x27;t expose APIs that let application code interact with the file system. That way in order to exploit an user&#x27;s computer you need to exploit a flaw in a library thousands of other programmers use instead of just importing std io.A lot of security seems geared toward server environments where you are only dealing with code you fully trust in, like the left-pad library. If bad code broke your server, you could really just load a backup. But most of people using computers are on their personal computers, a majority of them have no backup, and they are downloading and running random programs all the time. It makes it harder for both desktop application developers and their users if there isn&#x27;t a sandboxing layer in the middle. It&#x27;s probably one of the factors that is killing desktop apps in first place since most users can trust a website that is an image editor but fewer would install an image editor because it can contain a cryptominer, or a ransonware, or a virus, or whatever. replyhypeatei 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;m glad they made some improvements to security as a result of this finding. This \"attack\" is still very specialized though and requires local access which (as mentioned) could&#x27;ve exposed the user to keyloggers and other malware. reply RedTeamPT 17 hours agoparentYes, it requires an attacker in a powerful position with local access. However, it does not require special privileges or techniques that may trigger endpoint security (such as keyloggers or memory dumping). The only requirements are reading a JSON file and making a single Windows API call to retrieve the key. reply jabart 16 hours agorootparentIt sounds like this required both local access AND a Active Directory Domain Administrator account (which should have triggered EDR at some point) which is the end game anyway. They just managed to hop out of the AD environment to a non-ad server because of the other password being in this vault.

I&#x27;ve had lots of intelligent, well-informed programmers argue that my concern is groundless. reply lordofmoria 16 hours agoparentEverything is a tradeoff - but the basic balance is very strongly in favor of password managers:1. without a password manager that is shared on all your devices, you WILL re-use passwords out of frustration. 2. without a password manager, if you do any sort of regular sharing passwords with a engineering team, friends & family, you&#x27;ll resort to pretty insecure channels. 3. true E2E encryption, while still providing some surface area, has proven in the field through multiple pretty bad breaches[1], that it&#x27;s a security model that holds up under real-world circumstances.On the flip side, you are right: you are one compromised browser extension &#x2F; binary away from having your local vault decrypted, and ALL your passwords compromised. But think about this: if someone has this much local access, chances are they can install a keylogger anyway, or read your clipboard, so the real difference is you&#x27;ve conveniently pre-loaded all your sensitive information in one go for the bad actor.[1]For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.lastpass.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;12&#x2F;notice-of-recent-security-... reply WalterBright 16 hours agorootparentWith a keylogger, you lose passwords you typed in since the keylogger was installed, but that is rarely all of your passwords. reply edrxty 13 hours agorootparentMost of these managers support some form of 2fa. I use a yubikey with mine such that if my master password is compromised someone would still need to obtain my security key. You can enroll multiple and keep one in a safe and one or more on your person. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it prevents the vast majority of huge dragnet style malware attacks and a lot of the targeted ones until you get to the point where someone is trying to hunt you down on the street.This still leaves a case where someone manages to get the final key out of memory but you&#x27;re pretty hosed at that point anyway. I&#x27;d prefer a system where the yubikey itself is doing the final credential decryption instead of the CPU, unfortunately most people aren&#x27;t that paranoid though. reply lordofmoria 15 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely agree - that&#x27;s why I said \"so the real difference is you&#x27;ve conveniently pre-loaded all your sensitive information in one go for the bad actor.\" reply kemotep 10 hours agorootparentThe average person usually does the same but without encryption or strong passwords.I’ll stick to passwords that are impossible to guess and an encrypted vault with multifactor authentication. reply lxgr 58 minutes agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think anybody is arguing that password managers are the be-all and end-all of secure user authentication.But what would you use instead for services that support only password authentication? And even for services with 2FA: If one of the factors is a password, where do you store it? reply hypeatei 16 hours agoparentprevThey make it easy to have strong passwords and sync across devices.You could use a local vault and sync yourself, use a piece of paper in a safe, or use your brain to store them.All of these come with tradeoffs and their own risks. Pick your poison. reply tamimio 15 hours agoparentprevYou can use password vaults without creating a single point of failure by enabling 2FA for the accounts in the vault, without storing the keys there. Of course, it would still be bad if the vault was compromised, but it would be unlikely that anyone could access those accounts without accessing your 2FA. reply dzhiurgis 11 hours agorootparentIs there is a good solution&#x2F;mitigation to sharing passwords with 2FA&#x27;s in vault? reply chimprich 15 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s because it is a SPOF. However, a password manager seems to me the best compromise along the security &#x2F; convenience axes.I memorise good passwords for a handful of my most critical stuff (and have MFA). They don&#x27;t go in my password manager.If my password manager gets compromised then I probably could lose some cash, maybe get embarrassed by being impersonated on social media - it could get very inconvenient but not catastrophic. reply NegativeK 13 hours agorootparentPW managers are SPOF that typically replace a different, worse SPOF: humans trying to remember all of the passwords. reply firen777 9 hours agoparentprevThe way I look at it is, password vault is a single point of failure with a very VERY tiny attack surface that attacker will need to directly target you with a sniper rifle to actually hit you (assuming you are not using things like Lastpass. I personally use Keepass and synchronize the local vault across devices using Syncthing). Suffice to say, unless your last name is Snowden, it should not be a concern to you.Comparing to the common way of \"managing\" password (i.e. reusing one password everywhere), it is still a single point of failure. The difference is the attack surface balloons up in proportion to the number of website you sign up to. And just like a balloon, all it need is one poke, one website storing your password in plaintext to blow it all up. reply lxgr 53 minutes agorootparent> Suffice to say, unless your last name is Snowden, it should not be a concern to you.I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure about that. People store banking&#x2F;payment credentials in them, so there is a large incentive to mount a scalable attack against an even moderately popular password manager. Crypto wallets are a popular target too for the same reason (although the risk is even more immediate there). reply Sohcahtoa82 16 hours agoparentprevWithout using a vault, people end up re-using passwords or using weak passwords, which is IMO worse. reply paulpauper 16 hours agoparentprevIf done correctly it works. correctly being the operative word. reply 0xbadcafebee 16 hours agoprevtl;dr This means that any process that runs as the low-privileged user session can simply ask DPAPI for the credentials to unlock the vault, no questions asked and no PIN or fingerprint prompt required and Windows Hello is not even involved at all. The only caveat is that this does not work for other user accounts.Yikes Bitwarden has since made changes to their codebase to mitigate this particular scenario, which we will quickly summarize in the next section. They have also changed the default setting when using Windows Hello as login feature to require entering the main password at least once when Bitwarden is started.PhewProps to the security researchers for finding this bug!

Unfortunately those protections themselves are often inadequate (hence billions of dollars in losses), but it&#x27;s at least conceptually simpler and potentially could be fixed. reply dannyw 4 hours agoparentI&#x27;m not convinced crypto is inherently less secure; I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s more secure on average. Data breaches happen every day; whether in financial services or not. The difference is that a breach is catastrophic for crypto; but just bad for most businesses. reply lxgr 50 minutes agorootparentHave any of these catastrophic failures happened due to client&#x2F;wallet-side user confusion, though?I&#x27;m not a big fan of many things in crypto, but what I&#x27;ve seen in terms of \"what you see is what you sign\", clear user interfaces, secure user verification and confirmation etc. in some popular wallets is something that many existing banks could take a lesson from. reply kritr 15 hours agoprevSounds like the bigger issue in this case is that it’s not clear to developers in which cases they can rely on DPAPI to be entirely local, which I assume is what’s needed for password manager style applications. reply hiatus 15 hours agoprevInterestingly, the latest versions of bitwarden for mac that are available for download from github no longer work with biometric authentication, requiring the user to download the app from the app store in order to use that functionality. reply Pesthuf 6 hours agoparentI wonder why that is.

The security model of Android and iOS also makes it much easier to implement biometric unlock correctly. reply lxgr 1 hour agoparentprevProbably not, given that Android&#x27;s security model sandboxes apps and accordingly can identify which one is trying to access a given keychain credential. reply harrygeez 17 hours agoparentprevThere are a few convenient scapegoats here but ultimately in this case it is not biometric unlock that enabled this but rather characteristic of the Active Directory&#x27;s design (I&#x27;m not sure I will call it a weakness).For Android and iOS if you forget your PIN code I believe you are screwed, as in no one can decrypt your device for you. reply RedTeamPT 17 hours agorootparentActually it is not just an issue with AD design, but the AD design only makes it slightly worse. The underlying issue is that biometrics are not required to retrieve the biometric key from DPAPI and instead of authenticating with Windows Hello, any program could just simply ask DPAPI for the key. reply lxgr 1 hour agorootparentHave you looked into how (whether?) Windows Hello actually checks which app is asking it to perform a private key operation?On Android, this is tied to the app UID, and on iOS&#x2F;macOS it&#x27;s tied (I believe) to the developer team identifier. Hopefully there&#x27;s a similar mechanism on Windows...? reply magicalhippo 16 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding from a quick reading is that Bitwarden essentially used Windows Hello to ask \"is the user there\" and if so, asked DAPI to give Bitwarden the secret vault credentials which it happily did because that&#x27;s its job.The problem with this was that the vault credentials in DAPI was not safe from other programs running as the user, nor from domain admins which could use the recovery key stored on the AD server (which they did in their attack after gaining admin access).The solution was to use Windows Hello the way it was meant. That is, to store an asymmetric key pair, where the private key is hidden and protected by the biometrics or hardware security key, and use that to encrypt the secret vault credentials before storing them in DAPI. reply Aerbil313 12 hours agoprevTangential, what is the state of security on Linux desktop nowadays?

On page load, read from the URL fragment using window.location.hash and then sharing is just a matter of copying the URL, which could be done entirely in browser chrome, and&#x2F;or via a \"share\" button you provide.These might help:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jvt.me&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;01&#x2F;node-parse-url-fragment&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;66416539 reply matteason 14 hours agorootparentThis is exactly what I do on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matteason.co.uk&#x2F;scotbeats&#x2F; actually - any settings change is reflected in the URL and read back on load. When I implement sharing of individual mixes it&#x27;ll probably look a lot like this reply catapart 15 hours agorootparentprevGreat recommendation for such simple state! The portability of that is just perfect! reply catapart 15 hours agorootparentprevI feel your pain. I&#x27;m building my own local-first, no-nonsense app and need to solve the same problem. I&#x27;ve got proof of concepts for both a no-account server syncing scheme (app generates key, you manually enter that key in whichever instance you want to share the data with) and a web-rtc based p2p sync.But I will say that I have a need to sync data, which is why I&#x27;m putting effort into getting that syncing working (as well as compressed and encrypted). I really doubt you would need something robust for this type of thing. I&#x27;d, personally, be perfectly happy to get a json \"export\" of your local storage values that I could just \"import\" into a new instance of the app. I&#x27;ll email it to myself. No need to complicate it with automation and all of the baggage that comes along with accounts.If nothing else, a manual import&#x2F;export is a fully-featured first implementation that can be iterated into something more robust. reply matteason 14 hours agorootparentThis is a good point. I like the safety of being able to have my own local copy of my data so json export&#x2F;import would be a good first step reply 3np 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you happen to be excited about stuff like this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;veilid.com&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37118124https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;meet-spritely-and-veil...(Otherwise, encode-state-in-url-hash or export-to-json-and-paste aren&#x27;t too bad, unless you do want \"social\") reply jamesbooker83 15 hours agorootparentprevYou could generate some sort of hash of the selected options, encode it with something that’s short and human readable and then share that on the screen?Something easy for a human to transfer like honey-chair-balcony or something. Store the settings in the backend against this identifier and then you can retrieve it later? So you still need a backend but no need for accounts reply nullandvoid 56 minutes agoprevGreat collection of sounds for a release!Couple of suggestions I&#x27;d need before using properly:- Reset button- Save to URL so I can quickly reload with same presets reply matteason 39 minutes agoparentThanks! Both in the works now and nearly ready to go reply nonrandomstring 14 hours agoprevSeems the title is a little modest.There is a white noise generator, which \"cat &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom&#x2F;dev&#x2F;audio\" or a couple of lines of C code will accomplish. With just a few controls you can tailor the spectrum easily.Then there is an \"ambient music generator\" which you can knock together in a few hours with Csound, Supercollider, Pd, Chuck&#x2F;Faust and the like.Then there&#x27;s an \"ambient music application\" which in addition to inbuilt generators works with with online libraries of generators, seeds, patterns, sample loops, and a package&#x2F;element manager for getting and adding \"songs\". Last time I built one of those it was a few weeks of effort.Then there&#x27;s getting all that to run on smartphone, on multiple platforms, getting around all the quirks, permissions and general madness that is phone dev ecosystem.Well done on that last point. Seems the last of these is what the author has created and I kinda think it deserves a better name than \"white noise generator\".I didn&#x27;t realise there is still quite a culture of \"noise generators\" for people wanting to sleep, read or meditate. reply matteason 13 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s really kind, thank you. It&#x27;s definitely been a slog getting it working consistently across every browser&#x2F;device combo so I&#x27;m glad that effort&#x27;s paid off.On the music point - at the moment it&#x27;s just using looped versions of some (great) free tracks I&#x27;ve found, but I&#x27;m experimenting with generative music at the moment, including using environmental stimuli (mic, light level, accelerometer etc) to trigger changes in the music and bring in live samples from your surroundings.

This had me desperately searching for noise generators so I could get to sleep.“Grey” and “pink” noise, and some kinds of cricket noise seemed to be most suitable for masking my type (which is very similar to the high pitch sound an old analog tv makes when it’s on). Heavy rain is also good, but it’s hard to find something that is suitable because most have some additional water splashing and gurgling, which triggers my misophonia. reply matteason 13 hours agoparentI have actually had some lovely feedback from people who have said it&#x27;s helped with their tinnitus (amongst them, unexpectedly, X-Press 2 of 90s dance music fame, as well as lots of other DJs)It&#x27;s definitely going to vary from person to person so if anyone else has any suggestions of the types of noise that might help them I&#x27;m all ears. I&#x27;m also thinking of adding more controls to individual sounds so you might be able to control, for example, the exact pitch of the &#x27;bass rumble&#x27; sound, which may help people zero in on the frequency that helps mask their tinnitus reply Modified3019 12 hours agorootparentNow that I&#x27;m on my desktop, here&#x27;s a better list of my favoritesSome kind of 9800Hz statis&#x2F;hiss, reminiscent of crickets.

Just works in all situations. reply Teleoflexuous 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been working on white noise app for a bit, but with a slightly different focus. While it&#x27;s maintaining the same core points (limited bullshit, hopefully clear interface, sound staying on with phone screen being off) it addresses problem I constantly found myself having with every app: if I want to switch anything, I have to go back to the webpage&#x2F;app and there goes some of my focus. Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stimulantnoi.se&#x2F;So I made an app focused (hehe.) on ease of switching between noise intensity. There&#x27;s a long explanation why it&#x27;s important if you want one (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;incentiveassemblage.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;why-is-nobody-ser...), but if you&#x27;re the kind of nerd who knows about &#x27;flow state&#x27; and &#x27;Yerkes-Dodson law&#x27;, you pretty much got everything covered. The core point is: if intensity of your main activity is changing, your background noise should too, so that you maintain the same total level of arousal. Most likely double so for ADD people.My current solution is to use media buttons (forward&#x2F;backward) to control intensity. It took much more work than you&#x27;d expect to get media interface to do this without breaking currently playing sounds. In general anything that isn&#x27;t &#x27;Play this sound&#x27; works much worse than one would anticipate with how prevalent media is on the internet - I see ambiphone does the same thing with playing sounds separately, but you saved yourself from managing media interface, so I can&#x27;t quite tell how much pain exactly you have experienced with this. reply matteason 14 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s really interesting, I&#x27;ll check yours out.Yeah it has been painful. It took a lot of trial and error to get it working consistently across browsers, from absolute basics like getting gapless looping audio working consistently across browsers to maintaining playback while the screen&#x27;s off to iOS treating background audio differently in PWAs vs Safari.

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT SpaceX Illegally Fired Workers Critical of Musk, Federal Agency Says The National Labor Relations Board said the rocket company had wrongly dismissed eight people for a letter raising concerns about the chief executive. Share full article A complaint issued by the National Labor Relations Board says SpaceX fired eight employees in 2022 for calling on the company to distance itself from comments made by its chief executive, Elon Musk. Credit... Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters By Noam Scheiber Jan. 3, 2024 Federal labor officials accused the rocket company SpaceX on Wednesday of illegally firing eight employees for circulating a letter critical of the company’s founder and chief executive, Elon Musk. According to a complaint issued by a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board, the company fired the employees in 2022 for calling on SpaceX to distance itself from social media comments by Mr. Musk, including one in which he mocked sexual harassment accusations against him. The letter circulated by the employees also called on SpaceX, which has more than 13,000 employees, to clarify its harassment policies and enforce them consistently. The labor board complaint said the company’s president and chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, had illegally restricted employees from circulating the letter, and it identified similar infractions by other executives and managers. The case is scheduled to go before an administrative judge in early March unless SpaceX agrees to a settlement beforehand. A spokeswoman for the labor board said it was seeking make-whole remedies like reinstatement and back pay for the workers. “At SpaceX the rockets may be reusable, but the people who build them are treated as expendable,” said Paige Holland-Thielen, one of the employees who were fired. “I am hopeful these charges will hold SpaceX and its leadership accountable for their long history of mistreating workers and stifling discourse.” SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk has sometimes taken a hard line toward his companies’ employees, as when he laid off roughly half the work force at Twitter, now known as X, shortly after buying the company in 2022. He later fired roughly two dozen internal critics at Twitter, which has lost about 80 percent of the 7,500 employees who worked there when the billionaire took over. Tesla, where Mr. Musk is chief executive, has spent years litigating a case in which the labor board accused it of firing an employee for engaging in union activity. The board ruled in 2021 that the firing was illegal and ordered Tesla to reinstate the worker with back pay, a decision that a federal court affirmed. The company is appealing the case further. The Justice Department sued SpaceX in August, accusing it of discriminating against asylum-seekers and refugees in its hiring, but a judge has issued an injunction blocking that case from moving forward. In December 2021, a former SpaceX employee published an essay detailing instances of harassment and groping by colleagues that she said went largely unaddressed after she reported them. The essay provoked outrage within the company, which said it would begin an audit of its harassment policies. The next spring, Business Insider reported that SpaceX had paid $250,000 in 2018 to settle a claim in which an employee accused Mr. Musk of exposing himself and sexually propositioning her. Mr. Musk denied the accusation and joked about it on Twitter. Not long after, a group of employees began brainstorming ideas for making the company less tolerant of harassment and drafting the letter. Ms. Shotwell was aware of the effort and appeared supportive of it, according to comments she left on an internal communications platform seen by The New York Times. Image Paige Holland-Thielen, left, and Tom Moline said SpaceX had fired them after they helped organize a letter calling on the company to condemn Mr. Musk’s behavior. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times In mid-June 2022, several employees circulated their letter to colleagues. The letter called Mr. Musk’s public comments “a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us” and urged the company to “uphold clear repercussions for all unacceptable behavior, whether from the C.E.O. or an employee starting their first day.” While some managers responded sympathetically, within a few hours Ms. Shotwell reprimanded two employees involved in writing and distributing the letter, Tom Moline and Ms. Holland-Thielen. “Please stop flooding employee communication channels immediately,” Ms. Shotwell said in an email, adding, “I will consider your ignoring my email to be insubordination.” The next day, the company fired Mr. Moline, Ms. Holland-Thielen and three other employees involved in organizing the letter. It fired four others connected to the letter in July and August 2022. (The labor board considered only eight firings because the ninth employee did not file a formal charge.) The labor board complaint said that the firings had been retaliatory and that Ms. Shotwell and other SpaceX officials had interfered with the employees’ rights to engage in concerted activities that are legally protected. It also said a company vice president had broken the law by criticizing the letter at a meeting with employees a few days after it was circulated and “inviting employees to quit if they disagreed with the behavior of chief executive officer Elon Musk.” The Times previously reported that a company vice president had told workers that the letter was an extremist act and that Mr. Musk could do whatever he wanted at the company. The complaint also said a senior human resources official had illegally created the impression of surveillance when she showed workers involved in drafting the letter screen shots of a chat they had conducted on a messaging app. Ryan Mac contributed reporting.

I&#x27;d expect something like that (or probably worse) from Musk, but my view of Shotwell was that she was always \"the adult in the room\" at SpaceX. So a bit sad to see that she didn&#x27;t even realize the illegality of her actions (as other comments mentioned, all her actions were clearly put in writing). reply perihelions 3 hours agoparentThe NLRB only collects tens of millions in fines, nationwide, per year [0]. Shotwell probably understood the illegality of her actions quite well—and more importantly understood that the benefits of chilling labor activism in a 30k-employee company far outweighed the miniscule costs.In support of this: Shotwell not only fired these employees, but made a loud spectacle out of it—emailing the entire company to announce their firing.

GDPR, as an example, has been very effective, because the fines which can be levied for violations are genuinely impactful to businesses. The maximum fine is 4% of global annual revenue. Alphabet, for instance, could theoretically be liable for up to $11b, or around 20% of their net income. Amazon could be liable for up to $20b -- almost double their operating income (their 2022 net income was negative to begin with).As a result, GDPR is pretty well followed.

This idea is no more authoritarian than whistleblower protection laws.>firing employees for speaking out might get you, the employer, an echo chamber, but perhaps for your product an echo chamber is the business strategy you chose.I take it you haven&#x27;t read the article. The ask by employees was for SpaceX to uphold THEIR OWN STANDARDS by distancing themselves from Elon&#x27;s bad actions through his tweets. You do not get to create rules within a company and then ignore your own codified rules while firing people for non-codified ones (\"deeming\" speech \"insubordination\").As for Musk&#x27;s tweets in relation to his company, when you create company from a cult of personality, your actions for the cult and the company are blurred. So you have to be on your best behavior for both. reply shawndrost 2 hours agorootparentI agree with your gist, but I self-identify as an authoritarian, and I don&#x27;t think you can support your point without that admission.Your erroneous rationale is the paragraph about \"the ask\". The boss said \"no assholes\" (among other things) and then violated those rules (in the employees&#x27; eyes, and yours, and mine). The employees delicately asked the sub-boss to choose insubordination, and the request was denied, with additional consequences. Nobody was confused about who the boss was, or what actual rules were in place.Your authoritarian rationale -- which I agree with -- is in your final paragraph: he ought to hold himself to a higher standard if he wants to be so rich and influential. I&#x27;d push a button that would make that the rules of the world. But that&#x27;s an authoritarian POV. reply chii 2 hours agorootparentprev> your companyit&#x27;s not your company, until you own a controlling share.> This idea is no more authoritarian than whistleblower protection laws.the big difference is that whistleblowing is for protection against retaliation _for_ reporting illegal activities.

The use of \"your\" is appropriate.>the big difference is that whistleblowing is for protection against retaliation _for_ reporting illegal activities. Last time i looked, being as asshole CEO is not illegal.They are one in the same. Speaking about conduct and activities which can affect working conditions within a company is the basis of whistleblowing protections under the law (in the US). Speaking about conduct of a CEO in relation to the rules of conduct within your company is the same legal concept. reply fsckboy 3 hours agorootparentprevlaws work best when they don&#x27;t fill the courts with disputes that courts aren&#x27;t designd to handle. There is no way the government can define and enforce your utopia with respect to \"cults of personality\". Please, give it a shot, what are the markers of a corporate cult of personality that needs to be regulated? reply John23832 2 hours agorootparentI can tell you&#x27;re being disingenuous and that this isn&#x27;t going to be a constructive conversation, but I&#x27;ll bite.--You are confusing the topic here (I think purposefully).The first idea is whether asking an employer to hold another employee accountable for the rules of conduct agreed to by all employees is allowed. It is. It falls under protected speech at work in the United States. This has been codified for decades (largely as a result of unionization efforts) and the courts know how, and were designed to, \"handle it\".Second, Elon&#x27;s personal actions with respect to it&#x27;s effect on SpaceX. This would be for the Board of Directors to handle, but their is also clear prior art for a CEO&#x27;s actions outside of their job as CEO having impact on the company. We&#x27;ve literally seen this with Elon before. reply fsckboy 1 hour agorootparentso what? If you don&#x27;t like Elon, boycott his products. Don&#x27;t buy his shares. Don&#x27;t work for him.Elon&#x27;s track record is doing things that have made him the richest person in the world, winning at multiple games many other very clever people are trying very hard to win, including engaging in fields of endeavor that the \"socially conscious\" among you claim that they endorse. Even Lenin and Mao would admit that Elon has accomplished things that they would wish to accomplish themselves.That alone gives Elon credibility that vastly outpaces, collectively, yours, these disgruntled employees, and the Democratic Party who have decided he&#x27;s public enemy number one because he got fed up with Twitter cooperating with a one party state to subvert the 1st amendment and suppress speech they don&#x27;t like.Let him be him, why do you have this incredible urge to control other people and make them say things you like, or punish them if they don&#x27;t? Elon has earned the right to control Tesla, Twitter, and SpaceX, and Twitter was subverting democracy before Elon arrived, and that&#x27;s what upsets you.I don&#x27;t care if you are disingenuous, if you&#x27;re not, your sincerely held beliefs are dangerous to other people around you. replygitaarik 4 hours agoparentprevBut being fired the next day for a open letter that has some reasonable critique is something else.

I don&#x27;t think our legal system says that you can&#x27;t criticize the company you&#x27;re working for, or that a company can fire people for criticizing the company.Criticism is healthy and should be respected.

It is like politeness; someone else not having it might change how you behave but usually it doesn&#x27;t.And there is a difference between acknowledging it and causing a scene. Rank and file employees engaging in a political attempt to topple the CEO is certainly unprofessional. That level of manoeuvring is purposefully causing damage. reply jrflowers 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is a good point. Since employees are not shareholders they have no standing to criticize a CEO.

It’s not like they talked to the press. This letter was circulated internally using internal employee communications channels. Ironically, we would never have heard of it if they didn’t fire these employees in retaliation resulting in this lawsuit. reply chii 2 hours agorootparent> This letter was circulated internally using internal employee communications channels.if an employee undermined leadership&#x27;s authority, it is likely that they won&#x27;t last long.Good leadership means being able to recognize criticism from your employees, but this can&#x27;t come from grassroots effort within the company - it must come from the top.If the employee disagrees with the direction of the company, and the leadership doesn&#x27;t want to change (e.g., after voicing the opinion thru sanctioned feedback channels), their only option is to quit, or acquire a controlling share and _become_ the leadership.Trying to undermine leadership through collective action via other employees is akin to a threat and an internal coup in a country ruled by a dictator - and you know how that will go. reply cycomanic 4 hours agorootparentprevSince when is an internal letter public?

That is the entire point. For example, the First Amendment protects you from most consequences imposed by the government, such as being sent to jail, or even lesser consequences like being fired from a government job (depending).

Regardless of one&#x27;s views on unions (they have their place), it seems way off for the employer to deduct those payments. Perhaps it&#x27;s a convenience, but as a worker that is my money to pay to the union; if the union and the employer orchestrate the transfer of my membership payment behind closed doors before the money hits my account, it&#x27;s makes it harder to feel the union is truly acting in my interests.This is not just a matter of hygiene; for example, I was once in a (notoriously corrupt and socially reactionary) union here in Australia that represents retail workers. I didn&#x27;t have a choice in the matter and my membership payments were deducted by my employer. About a decade later, a court ruled that a deal made between that employer and the union had left workers worse off (but was in the interests of the union bureaucracy).

And the union leaders became entangled into the business cultures, also known as the \"polder model\". They basically made underhanded deals and cashed out.

There is no burden of proof here. reply imgabe 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not disputing that they were fired for the letter, I&#x27;m disputing that the letter is a protected discussion of workplace conditions. reply maxbond 3 hours agorootparentprevAlso not a lawyer.I think if, for instance, a group of roof tile workers were discussing how they thought their safety straps needed to be replaced, and were fired for doing so - whether or not the straps needed replacing would be immaterial. The discussion is protected.In the same way, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s material whether Twitter is disruptive to their work. NLRB&#x27;s argument, if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, is that they were discussing their conditions, and that such a discussion is protected. reply imgabe 3 hours agorootparentI think the question is whether the boss&#x27;s personal social media account is part of their workplace conditions. A safety strap is definitely a part of the work place. If your job is not social media manager and you don&#x27;t work at Twitter (these are SpaceX employees), then it&#x27;s hard to see how Twitter is a part of their workplace conditions.

His tweets regularly move the share price, so it makes sense to me that they might regularly impact employees (not to say the share price is the mechanism by which that would happen, just that it stands to reason his tweets are relevant to the operations of the business if they&#x27;re relevant to its valuation).Also, if you listen to Musk, he has no regular personal and working hours, they&#x27;re constantly intermingled.I think many people in the thread have a misconception that because Twitter is something kinda silly that it couldn&#x27;t possibly matter. I think it can be helpful to mentally substitute \"Twitter\" with \"public statements.\"As a thought experiment, if the CEO of your company went on a drunken bender (not saying this is what Musk did, just a hypothetical) and they started tweeting a bunch of really offensive stuff, do you think that could impact your job? Say, if you were a startup about to do another round of fundraising - they might alienate investors, and you might end up losing your job. reply imgabe 3 hours agorootparentI kinda think \"workplace conditions\" would mean, you know, the conditions in which you do your work, like the physical environment where you are working. If the safety straps are old and frayed or the air conditioning in the office is broken, this is a condition of the workplace.I don&#x27;t think it means \"every conceivable thing in the world that might affect the share price\". If the Fed changes the interest rates, that could affect the share price. Does that mean that if I want to email my 13,000 co-workers my thoughts about the Fed&#x27;s interest rate policy this is a protected discussion of workplace conditions? I don&#x27;t think so.The test seems to be \"workplace conditions\" not \"things that impact employees\" or \"things that can affect the share price\" which could be literally anything at all. reply maxbond 3 hours agorootparentPlease note I specifically said I wasn&#x27;t discussing share price. Regarding the Fed, that honestly is a misrepresentation of what I said. Please don&#x27;t do that. And please review this part of my previous post:> (not to say the share price is the mechanism by which that would happen, just that it stands to reason his tweets are relevant to the operations of the business if they&#x27;re relevant to its valuation)Public statements can contribute to a hostile work environment. What is being alleged is that joking about sexual harassment and a lack of clarity around workplace policies have created a hostile work environment. That is directly related to working conditions.

You established a chain of logic like so: If something affects the share price, then it is relevant to business operations Musk&#x27;s tweets affect the share price Therefore Musk&#x27;s tweets are relevant to business operations.I provided a counterexample (interest rates) of something that affects the share price but is not relevant to business operations. So the first condition of your argument is false and therefore it is not a sound argument. Simply because Musk&#x27;s tweets affect the share price, this does not necessarily mean they are relevant to business operations (to the extent that they are protected discussion about workplace environment).I&#x27;ve read the letter, nowhere does the phrase \"hostile work environment\" appear. It sounds much more like a small group of employees are demanding that management implement DEI policies, management doesn&#x27;t want to, the employees wouldn&#x27;t shut up about it and so they got fired.Discussing a policy could fall under workplace conditions, I suppose. But they weren&#x27;t fired for discussing it. They discussed it, they got an answer, they wanted to keep on discussing it. At some point I think management is allowed to make a decision about whether they&#x27;re going to implement a policy or not. It&#x27;s not a legal requirement like \"fix the safety straps\" either, so at what point do you tell the employees to either let it go or get out? Are the required to allow employees to endlessly spam communication channels after management has made the decision about a policy? reply maxbond 2 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m not misrepresenting what you said, I&#x27;m refuting it.I think you&#x27;re distorting what I said, actually. What I said was that it is reasonable to believe that the tweets are disruptive, not that everything which impacts the stock price or even the operations of the business is relevant to working conditions.I can understand how that may not have been clear on a first reading, but after I pointed this out and asked you to review what I said, I do think that should have been clear to you.> I&#x27;ve read the letter, nowhere does the phrase \"hostile work environment\" appear.I don&#x27;t know if you maybe didn&#x27;t see this edit because of how HN works, but I did clarify that already:> (To be clear, they never say the words \"hostile work environment,\" that is my interpretation.)They are pretty clearly describing a work environment which is hostile. They&#x27;re saying that they don&#x27;t have clarity about what the policies are, that their work is interrupted, and that the lack of clarity causes rules to be enforced inconsistently. Call that whatever you want and it&#x27;s still relevant to working conditions.> It sounds much more like a small group of employees are demanding that management implement DEI policiesThat&#x27;s a complete misreading. Where did you even get that? The document has 3 calls to action and none of them are about DEI. They mention the workplace, as it exists, is diverse. That&#x27;s all I can see and it&#x27;s completely tangential. (By the way, the phrase \"DEI\" doesn&#x27;t appear in the letter, either.)> But they weren&#x27;t fired for discussing it.They literally were.> \"11.

However, we feel an unequal burden to carry this effort as the company has not applied appropriate urgency and resources to the problem in a manner consistent with our approach to critical path technical projects.In other words, \"nobody asked us to promote DEI throughout the company and it&#x27;s not part of our job but we&#x27;re mad that the company doesn&#x27;t take it as seriously as they do building rockets (the purpose of the company)\".Not every single gripe about your company is protected discussion. I can propose my company implement unlimited PTO. They can say no. I can keep proposing it. I can write open letters demanding it. I can get the media to publish articles about how it&#x27;s such a tragedy that my company doesn&#x27;t take my unlimited PTO proposal as seriously as they do making widgets. They can get fed up that I won&#x27;t shut up about it after they already considered it and said no and fire me. That&#x27;s not illegal. reply maxbond 1 hour agorootparentMy mistake re DEI.

Maybe they just don&#x27;t like Musk so they throw everything they can at him regardless of merit. Given Musk&#x27;s other misadventures in labor relations, it would stand to reason that the people at the NRLB are not fans of his.Maybe the 8 people who were fired are just hoping for a quick settlement and some extra money. They might have a hard time finding new jobs now that they&#x27;ve outed themselves as insufferable woke scolds. Probably no reference from SpaceX forthcoming...You can&#x27;t just assume that since someone filed a lawsuit they&#x27;re automatically right, especially after hearing only one side. Otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t have that whole trial thingy, you know?

Twitter might have a trivial and lighthearted feel, but that doesn&#x27;t detract. Eg, when Musk tweeted he was taking Tesla public, it was probably very disruptive, regardless of the medium.

First and most importantly, Tesla&#x27;s actions were grievously reprehensible. Diaz was subjected to a grossly racist workplace, with racist conduct perpetuated not only by coworkers or subordinates but also-and perhaps especially-by supervisors like Martinez, who called Diaz racist slurs and drew the racist picaninny, and Hurtado, who directed the N-word at Diaz over 30 times and informed Diaz that he wished he could get all “N-words” fired. Cf. Flores, 873 F.3d at 760; Zhang, 339 F.3d at 1043. Reports to authority often went unanswered and when the company responded, it often failed to interview witnesses or review security footage. Worse yet, a supervisor who learned of Diaz&#x27;s complaints subsequently failed to investigate and was in fact told by Tesla to not personally investigate the complaint. Tr. 3-541:22-542:1, 544:21-545:2, 549:13-550:16. Another supervisor was told to stop investigating before he reached a conclusion, and Diaz and his harasser ended up being reprimanded for the conduct directed at Diaz. See Tr. 2387:10-390:18, 395:21-396:7. Martinez, a Tesla supervisor and the main perpetrator of racist conduct, still works at Tesla, nearly a decade after he forced Diaz to endure repeated cruelty and shame. Not only did the company turn a blind eye to the racism, but the jury also could have interpreted the evidence to show that Tesla knew what it was supposed to do and affirmatively chose to not carry out the proper responses.It should be no surprise that a CEO running a organization that supports grievously reprehensible racist conduct and actively retaliates against worker complaints of shocking racial discrimination and harassment like swastikas on the walls would also support retaliation against people highlighting their less mustache-twirling evil.If the swastikas on the walls of your car factory do not get you, firing some people over a letter will not either.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;diaz-v-tesla-inc-7 reply throwsssss 4 hours agoprevPeople from all walks of life support this pathalogical liar reply lessbergstein 6 hours agoprevnext [6 more] [flagged] thebigman433 5 hours agoparentIts also probably because Elon&#x27;s companies do insane shit brazenly, without even trying to hide it.

    "originBody": "The Drive Stats of Backblaze Storage Pods January 3, 2024 by Andy Klein // 1 Comment Since 2009, Backblaze has written extensively about the data storage servers we created and deployed which we call Backblaze Storage Pods. We not only wrote about our Storage Pods, we open sourced the design, published a parts list, and even provided instructions on how to build one. Many people did. Of the six storage pod versions we produced, four of them are still in operation in our data centers today. Over the last few years, we began using storage servers from Dell and, more recently, Supermicro, as they have proven to be economically and operationally viable in our environment. Since 2013, we have also written extensively about our Drive Stats, sharing reports on the failure rates of the HDDs and SSDs in our legion of storage servers. We have examined the drive failure rates by manufacturer, size, age, and so on, but we have never analyzed the drive failure rates of the storage servers—until now. Let’s take a look at the Drive Stats for our fleet of storage servers and see what we can learn. Storage Pods, Storage Servers, and Backblaze Vaults Let’s start with a few definitions: Storage Server: A storage server is our generic name for a server from any manufacturer which we use to store customer data. We use storage servers from Backblaze, Dell, and Supermicro. Storage Pod: A Storage Pod is the name we gave to the storage servers Backblaze designed and had built for our data centers. The first Backblaze Storage Pod version was announced in September 2009. Subsequent versions are 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, and 6.1. All but 6.1 were announced publicly. Backblaze Vault: A Backblaze Vault is 20 storage servers grouped together for the purpose of data storage. Uploaded data arrives at a given storage server within a Backblaze Vault and is encoded into 20 parts with a given part being either a data blob or parity. Each of the 20 parts (shards) is then stored on one of the 20 storage servers. As you review the charts and tables here are a few things to know about Backblaze Vaults. There are currently six cohorts of storage servers in operation today: Supermicro, Dell, Backblaze 3.0, Backblaze 5.0, Backblaze 6.0, and Backblaze 6.1. A given Vault will always be made up from one of the six cohorts of storage servers noted above. For example, Vault 1016 is made up of 20 Backblaze 5.0 Storage Pods and Vault 1176 is made of the 20 Supermicro servers. A given Vault is made up of storage servers that contain the same number of drives as follows: Dell servers: 26 drives. Backblaze 3.0 and Backblaze 5.0 servers: 45 drives. Backblaze 6.0, Backblaze 6.1, and Supermicro servers: 60 drives. All of the hard drives in a Backblaze Vault will be logically the same size; so, 16TB drives for example. Drive Stats by Backblaze Vault Cohort With the background out of the way, let’s get started. As of the end of Q3 2023, there were a total of 241 Backblaze Vaults divided into the six cohorts, as shown in the chart below. The chart includes the server cohort, the number of Vaults in the cohort, and the percentage that cohort is of the total number of Vaults. Vaults consisting of Backblaze servers still comprise 68% of the vaults in use today (shaded from orange to red), although that number is dropping as older Vaults are being replaced with newer server models, typically the Supermicro systems. The table below shows the Drive Stats for the different Vault cohorts identified above for Q3 2023. The Avg Age (months) column is the average age of the drives, not the average age of the Vaults. The two may seem to be related, that’s not entirely the case. It is true the Backblaze 3.0 Vaults were deployed first followed in order by the 5.0 and 6.0 Vaults, but that’s where things get messy. There was some overlap between the Dell and Backblaze 6.1 deployments as the Dell systems were deployed in our central Europe data center, while the 6.1 Vaults continued to be deployed in the U.S. In addition, some migrations from the Backblaze 3.0 Vaults were initially done to 6.1 Vaults while we were also deploying new drives in the Supermicro Vaults. The AFR for each of the server versions does not seem to follow any pattern or correlation to the average age of the drives. This was unexpected because, in general, as drives pass about four years in age, they start to fail more often. This should mean that Vaults with older drives, especially those with drives whose average age is over four years (48 months), should have a higher failure rate. But, as we can see, the Backblaze 5.0 Vaults defy that expectation. To see if we can determine what’s going on, let’s expand on the previous table and dig into the different drive sizes that are in each Vault cohort, as shown in the table below. Observations for Each Vault Cohort Backblaze 3.0: Obviously these Vaults have the oldest drives and, given their AFR is nearly twice the average for all of the drives (1.53%), it would make sense to migrate off of these servers. Of course the 6TB drives seem to be the exception, but at some point they will most likely “hit the wall” and start failing. Backblaze 5.0: There are two Backblaze 5.0 drive sizes (4TB and 8TB) and the AFR for each is well below the average AFR for all of the drives (1.53%). The average age of the two drive sizes is nearly seven years or more. When compared to the Backblaze 6.0 Vaults, it would seem that migrating the 5.0 Vaults could wait, but there is an operational consideration here. The Backblaze 5.0 Vaults each contain 45 drives, and from the perspective of data density per system, they should be migrated to 60 drive servers sooner rather than later to optimize data center rack space. Backblaze 6.0: These Vaults as a group don’t seem to make any of the five different drive sizes happy. Only the AFR of the 4TB drives (1.42%) is just barely below the average AFR for all of the drives. The rest of the drive groups are well above the average. Backblaze 6.1: The 6.1 servers are similar to the 6.0 servers, but with an upgraded CPU and faster NIC cards. Is that why their annualized failure rates are much lower than the 6.0 systems? Maybe, but the drives in the 6.1 systems are also much younger, about half the age of those in the 6.0 systems, so we don’t have the full picture yet. Dell: The 14TB drives in the Dell Vaults seem to be a problem at a 5.46% AFR. Much of that is driven by two particular Dell vaults which have a high AFR, over 8% for Q3. This appears to be related to their location in the data center. All 40 of the Dell servers which make up these two Vaults were relocated to the top of 52U racks, and it appears that initially they did not like their new location. Recent data indicates they are doing much better, and we’ll publish that data soon. We’ll need to see what happens over the next few quarters. That said, if you remove these two Vaults from the Dell tally, the AFR is a respectable 0.99% for the remaining Vaults. Supermicro: This server cohort is mostly 16TB drives which are doing very well with an AFR of 0.62%. The one 14TB Vault is worth our attention with an AFR of 1.95%, and the 22TB Vault is too new to do any analysis. Drive Stats by Drive Size and Vault Cohort Another way to look at the data is to take the previous table and re-sort it by drive size. Before we do that let’s establish the AFR for the different drive sizes aggregated over all Vaults. As we can see in Q3 the 6TB and 22TB Vaults had zero failures (AFR = 0%). Also, the 10TB Vault is indeed only one Vault, so there are no other 10TB Vaults to compare it to. Given this, for readability, we will remove the 6TB, 10TB, and 22TB Vaults from the next table which compares how each drive size has fared in each of the six different Vault cohorts. Currently we are migrating the 4TB drive Vaults to larger Vaults, replacing them with drives of 16TB and above. The migrations are done using an in-house system which we’ll expand upon in a future post. The specific order of migrations is based on failure rates and durability of the existing 4TB Vaults with an eye towards removing the Backblaze 3.0 systems first as they are nearly 10 years old in some cases, and many of the non-drive replacement parts are no longer available. Whether we give away, destroy, or recycle the retired Backblaze 3.0 Storage Pods (sans drives) is still being debated. For the 8TB drive Vaults, the Backblaze 5.0 Vaults are up first for migration when the time comes. Yes, their AFR is lower then the Backblaze 6.0 Vaults, but remember: the 5.0 Vaults are 45 drive units which are not as efficient storage density-wise versus the 60 drive systems. Speaking of systems with less than 60 drives, the Dell servers are 26 drives. Those 26 drives are in a 2U chassis versus a 4U chassis for all of the other servers. The Dell servers are not quite as dense as the 60 drive units, but their 2U form factor gives us some flexibility in filling racks, especially when you add utility servers (1U or 2U) and networking gear to the mix. That’s one of the reasons the two Dell Vaults we noted earlier were moved to the top of the 52U racks. FYI, those two Vaults hold 14TB drives and are two of the four 14TB Dell Vaults making up the 5.46% AFR. The AFR for the Dell Vaults with 12TB and 16TB drives is 0.76% and 0.92% respectively. As noted earlier, we expect the AFR for 14TB Dell Vaults to drop over the coming months. What Have We Learned? Our goal today was to see what we can learn about the drive failure rates of the storage servers we use in our data centers. All of our storage servers are grouped in operational systems we call Backblaze Vaults. There are six different cohorts of storage servers with each vault being composed of the same type of storage server, hence there are six types of vaults. As we dug into data, we found that the different cohorts of Vaults had different annualized failure rates. What we didn’t find was a correlation between the age of the drives used in the servers and the annualized failure rates of the different Vault cohorts. For example, the Backblaze 5.0 Vaults have a much lower AFR of 0.99% versus the Backblaze 6.0 Vault AFR at 2.14%—even though the drives in the 5.0 Vaults are nearly twice as old on average than the drives in the 6.0 Vaults. This suggests that while our initial foray into the annualized failure rates of the different Vault cohorts is a good first step, there is more to do here. Where Do We Go From Here? In general, all of the Vaults in a given cohort were manufactured to the same specifications, used the same parts, and were assembled using the same processes. One obvious difference is that different drive models are used in each Vault cohort. For example, the 16TB vaults are composed of seven different drive models. Do some drive models work better in one Vault cohort versus another? Over the next couple of quarters we’ll dig into the data and let you know what we find. Hopefully it will add to our understanding of the annualized failures rates of the different Vault cohorts. Stay tuned. print Category: Cloud Storage, Featured, Featured-Cloud Storage, Hard Drive Stats, Server BackupTag: B2Cloud",

The solution according to support was to remove my backup including version history. When I complained that was a problem, they suggested a second account, which they would refund the price for, after I made the switch.Rclone give me more control, which I like. I use tmutil to create snapshots of what I backup, too. Very slick. reply tzs 7 hours agorootparentprevFirst make sure you understand how they handle encryption. The features and ease of use come at the cost of some security.They generate a public&#x2F;private key pair for the user. The client gets the public key and the server gets the private key. During backups the data is encrypted on the client with a symmetric key (which I believe is generated on the client). The encrypted data is sent to the server. The symmetric key is encrypted using the public key and also sent to the server.On a restore they use the private key on the server to decrypt the encrypted symmetric key, use that key to decrypt the backup data, and then make the decrypted files available in a zip file that the user can download. The download is over HTTPS so is encrypted in transit.If you don&#x27;t like the idea of them having such access to your private key they do offer an option to add additional protection [1]:> The user’s private key which is stored safely in our data center is protected by a password that is highly guarded. But for some users this is not good enough and we allow the user to secure this file with their own password. When this is done it is impossible to access the data without the user’s password. Unfortunately, this also means we can’t help the user if they ever forget this password so we don’t recommend it for most users.If you do that then when you restore you have to enter that password on their site when requesting the restore, so their server can decrypt the private key.They give some more detail in their \"Security Question Round-up!\" [2]:> The answer shows a weak point in the Backblaze system. As you prepare a restore, you must type in your private passphrase into the restore server. This is not written to disk, but held in RAM and for the period of time of decrypting all your files, and they are then stored in \"clear text\" on our very highly secured servers until they are ZIPPED up and offered to you to be downloaded. At that moment you can download them (by HTTPS only), then you can \"delete the restore zip\" which means you close the window of time that your files are available in plain text.> So to recap: if you never actually prepare a restore, we cannot possibly know what is in your files, but if you prepare a restore (let&#x27;s say of a few files) then for the couple minutes they are being prepared and downloaded they are in \"plain text\" on a HIGHLY SECURE system in the Backblaze datacenter. At that moment, if a Backblaze employee were malicious enough and dedicated enough and was watching (which is actually pretty hard, we get thousands of restores every day so it would fly by quickly) they could see your filenames appear on the Linux servers right before they are ZIPPED up into a new bundle. A few minutes of exposure.> We actually want to improve this to provide a password encrypted ZIP file for download, and then the FINAL improvement is to actually allow you to download the private encryption key, download the encrypted files, and provide the pass phrase in the privacy of your computer.

What can cause confusion is that Backblaze is offering multiple storage products. One is a cloud storage service similar to S3, and one is a computer backup service and accompanying client software.• If you use the backup service, which is called Computer Backup, Backblaze supplies the client backup software. Computer Backup is $9&#x2F;month&#x2F;computer (with discounts if you pay in advance which can lower it to $5.25&#x2F;month&#x2F;computer if you pay 3 years in advance) and has file sharing and mobile apps.It&#x27;s meant to be an all-in-one easy to use backup service that you don&#x27;t have to think much about.• If you are using the S3-like service, which is called B2, Backblaze just provides storage and an API. If you want to use it for backup you have to supply the backup software, such as Restic. It is priced based on storage rather than number of computer, costing $6&#x2F;TB&#x2F;month.There are no data transfer costs for uploads. Downloads are $0.01&#x2F;GB but each month you get free up to 3x the total amount you have stored. You&#x27;d have to be having a really bad month if you had to restore your entire backup more than 3 times!There are also charges for using some API calls. It looks like upload and delete calls are free, download calls are 2500 free per day then $0.0004 per 10000, and calls that manipulate data on the server like copying are 2500 free per day then $0.0004 per 1000 calls.

Storage server margin used to be insane, over 80% after COGS back in the 00s and only slightly less last decade, and there&#x27;s still room to compete. reply hinkley 12 hours agorootparentI hope history will eventually read something like this:In the aftermath of the Dot Com Bust, manufacturers became conservative, and lost their ability to dream big. Into this power vacuum stepped the so called Cloud Providers, who in some cases made their own hardware and tools to solve their problems.Over time manufacturing caught up, missing tools were written, and the Cloud providers went back to solving the main problem nearly none of their customers of suppliers could ever solve: the speed of light (locality). reply mbrameld 14 hours agoparentprev> Over the last few years, we began using storage servers from Dell and, more recently, Supermicro, as they have proven to be economically and operationally viable in our environment.Sounds like it was money. reply zdw 12 hours agoparentprevI would imagine that in the early days there was nothing that met the requirements.

Mine would roughly be a terabyte, and so far my thinking is shaking out as:For incrementally backing up laptop data, the process needs to run on my laptop anyway, so I may as well just use Arq.For NAS data that changes frequently enough to desire incrementals, choose Synology Hyperbackup.For NAS data that doesn&#x27;t change frequently and can just be sync&#x27;d, choose Synology Cloud Sync.For NAS data that you don&#x27;t need locally and only need to archive, choose Synology Cloud Sync with one-way-sync. (Less hassle than AWS Glacier.)As for the cloud provider itself, I&#x27;m think I&#x27;ll probably go with Wasabi, at $6&#x2F;TB. I heard that Backblaze occasionally has weird gotchas that surprise people, like auto-deleting files from your backups that you delete locally, so I just feel cautious.Main things giving me pause: minimum block size on Wasabi (I&#x27;m sure some of my files are smaller; don&#x27;t know what sticker shock I&#x27;ll experience), and unsure why I should consider a command line tool like restic instead of the above. reply MobileVet 10 hours agoparentSo many options… and the data is likely very precious so it is worth the time to review and test what you can.I tried several different configurations and finally landed on the following.I have a Synology that I have been running for a couple years now.- RAID 0 w 2 14TB drives, 400GB is highly criticalThe 400GB of highly critical is further backed up:- external 1 TB SSD that lives at my sisters house and is updated monthly or so using Sync w encrypted EXT4 formatting- B2 sync with 1 way, encrypted backup and nightly updates (using Backblaze’s encryption because Synology requires your device and if that goes… you are sol)I friggin love it.

Just get a cheap thumb flash drive? reply shiroiuma 2 hours agoparentI&#x27;d recommend a USB-connected external hard drive (not SSD). You don&#x27;t have very much data, so a thumb drive could probably hold everything, but SSDs&#x2F;flash aren&#x27;t great for long-term data storage and will lose their data if you don&#x27;t power them up and use them now and then. An actual HD doesn&#x27;t have this problem, plus they&#x27;re typically 1TB+ so you&#x27;d have plenty of space for future needs.Alternatively, you could get a handful of flash thumb drives and back up onto all of them, syncing with a different one each week&#x2F;month&#x2F;whenever so that they&#x27;re all getting continuously refreshed and you&#x27;d have snapshots in case you accidentally delete something and that deletion gets synced to the most-recent drive. reply etrautmann 9 hours agoparentprevYeah I have 3.5TB of photos.

    "originBody": "Linux hits nearly 4% desktop user share on Statcounter By Liam Dawe - 3 January 2024 at 11:33 am UTCViews: 31,294 According to Statcounter, which should be taken with a pinch of salt of course like any sampling, the Linux share on the desktop hit nearly 4% in December 2023. Last month was a record too and a clear trend over time, as going back a couple of years, it was rarely coming close to 2% but now it's repeatedly nearing 4% so it's quite a good sign overall. The latest from Statcounter shows for all of 2023 below: January - 2.91% February - 2.94% March - 2.85% April - 2.83% May - 2.7% June - 3.07% July - 3.12% August - 3.18% September - 3.02% October - 2.92% November - 3.22% December - 3.82% Looking at December it shows Windows rising too, with macOS dropping down. If we actually take ChromeOS directly into the Linux numbers for December 2023 the overall number would actually be 6.24% (ChromeOS is Linux after all). Here's how just Linux looks over time on Statcounter since early 2009 until now: Seems like a pretty clear trend over time don't you think? Nice to see this happening elsewhere, just like we've seen over years with the Steam Survey. You can see their stats over here. Article taken from GamingOnLinux.com.

I know the main point is the web, but since you can install Steam and play Steam games, that's at least one program you can use. But the way you phrased it makes me think native ChromeOS programs don't actually work on Linux If Adobe comes out with its entire suite for ChromeOS (namely After Effects) but it doesn't work on Linux, I would not consider ChromeOS a Linux distribution, because it being \"based on Linux\" would mean nothing for the effective market share of Linux. 1 Likes, Who? mad_mesa about 21 hours ago Link View PC info My hypothesis is that statcounter is seeing Steam Deck, and/or that the new ChromeOS Flex may have a slightly different user agent string that is making it miss their special case exception that would otherwise prevent it from getting grouped in with the other Linux distributions.

Until last year ChromeOS the UI and ChromeOS the browser were exactly the same binary. The change last year to separate them was to make ChromeOS more Linux-like. They dabbled with having web-apps-but-packaged-differently for a while but dropped that (as Google tends to do) a few years ago in favour of just-web-apps. The thing that ChromeOS can do that desktop Linux can't (but which Windows can) is run Android applications. But people generally don't think of Android (or Windows) as a desktop Linux OS. 0 Likes Lachu about 21 hours ago Link So, standalone ChromeOS have had smaller market share than other desktop Linux distributions? 0 Likes CatKiller about 21 hours ago Link View PC info Supporter Plus Quoting: mad_mesaMy hypothesis is that statcounter is seeing Steam Deck, and/or that the new ChromeOS Flex may have a slightly different user agent string that is making it miss their special case exception that would otherwise prevent it from getting grouped in with the other Linux distributions.

I worked at Microsoft for years and continued to run Windows for some time afterwards, sometimes dual booting with Linux. I&#x27;ve tried but always hated MacOS.But Windows 8 completely broke me -- this was just an unusable OS, plastered with ads and shortcuts that didn&#x27;t work and a wildly inconsistent UI; big tiles one second, tiny icons the next, some things you had to double-click that used to be a single click, some things you still had to double-click. Some buttons were just plain text, others were buttons, others were just frames with text. It made you sign in with a Microsoft account for reasons never explained. It was just such a heap of garbage that I couldn&#x27;t do it any more. Trying to help family members who had trouble with their computers became a horrifying slog.So I completely unplugged from Windows; switched to Chromebooks for casual stuff and recommended them to my family members, and a variety of Linux distributions for more serious stuff.But I really know almost nobody who uses Windows; this is the bubble I&#x27;m in. Lots of people use MacOS, many people use Linux, and the others use ChromeOS. When I see a survey like this saying that 72% of users still use Windows I&#x27;m shocked to my core. I guess my next computer I&#x27;ll stick with Windows for a bit to see if things are more sane now. reply giancarlostoro 18 hours agoparentI was able to suck it up from 8 till 10, but 11 is starting to piss me off.I bought a gaming computer a year ago, it was fully pre-built. Somehow a 2 thousand (or whatever) computer comes with Windows Home instead of Pro (wtf Microsoft, you should really make sure OEMs are giving out Pro versions for gaming systems). This is where the fun begins, and I&#x27;ve posted it before on HN. I couldn&#x27;t install Windows 11 offline in order to avoid making a Microsoft account. I don&#x27;t like all my personal shit automagically being uploaded to Microsoft&#x27;s cloud, especially when they default to on, and companies will reset settings on a whim.So what happened next is I had to literally login, and then when I was finally on Windows, I wanted to add a new account because I don&#x27;t like that Windows doesn&#x27;t let me set the *username* local to the OS, if you&#x27;re going to make me login, please let me set the username, I don&#x27;t want my Windows path to be C:&#x2F;Users&#x2F;gianc&#x2F;Documents or whatever. I rather set that myself, re-configuring all of that after the fact feels like it will break something, and it is not worth it.So I go to create a new Windows offline account only to be told by the modern Windows 11 UI that I&#x27;m on Home edition of Windows, and cannot add users from that software, go to software XYZ from Windows. So I go there... guess what error I got? The same exact error telling me to go back to the previous program. I wound up installing Linux in frustration.The only reason I don&#x27;t use Linux is if the drivers stop being supported OOTB by the installer, which has happened to me before. Linux might have its own issues, but at least it&#x27;s not completely FUBARd despite one of the largest companies pouring millions into its development. reply thehappypm 17 hours agorootparentMy MIL got a Windows 11 laptop for Christmas and it is ridiculous.They lock down executables by default, only allowing web sites and their app store.Guess what company doesn’t have an app?

By comparison my Surface Book 2 had Windows Pro, granted that was a Microsoft system yes, but it would have been insane if it only came with Windows Home edition after spending over a thousand dollars on a laptop. I buy gaming systems because it meets my hardware requirements for dev work. Visual Studio consumes all available memory. Windows Home has strange limitations which I just don&#x27;t care for as a literal pro user. reply close04 18 hours agorootparent> its silly paying thousands of dollars for a computer and only getting a basic version of WindowsIt very well may be but this one is not on Microsoft. Using their power to force decisions onto others is one easy way to land in hot(ter) water. This would probably be an abuse of dominant position which everyone wants less of.OEMs have more negotiating power than regular users so it&#x27;s no easy or cheap feat to force them. Arbitrarily defining which licenses can work with what hardware makes everything complicated for everyone, it needs constant updating as the hardware changes, it needs a lot of assumptions on how the user uses the PC, would probably create the garden variety loophole hunt for tricking the system.The sensible choice here is to go for a product that really fits your needs especially since that market is very well served by competition. You have dozens of competitors and even the DYI option. You&#x27;re not buying a black box. It can be a gaming PC with Windows Home just as it can be a gaming PC with a 4060 GPU. Nvidia or MS should have no say in what a vendor can sell. reply giancarlostoro 16 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t need to force anything, they could just negotiate a favorable license cost, and make sure people aren&#x27;t getting mediocre versions of Windows after spending over a thousand dollars on a Windows machine.

You&#x27;re running away from your very basic responsibility of looking at the spec sheet, and you&#x27;re blaming Microsoft or the OEM for this. You chose a Windows Home system probably because it was cheaper than others. This is one way it was cheaper, you probably got the Home license for free\".Many people would go for cheaper or no license in order to get better hardware. MS is already strong arming OEMs to bundle Windows licenses, they should absolutely not use their power to force them even more.> I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying System76 for my next desktopPerfectly valid (and great) choice. But you could pay a whopping $82.000 for a workstation and it doesn&#x27;t come with a Windows Pro&#x2F;Enterprise license or RHEL Workstation Standard (lifetime, not just the one year) subscription.

Nowadays when people complain about Linux&#x27;s usability I know that they are normally overstating or talking from prejudice because from a practical point of view no way the usability of any modern distro is significantly behind Windows&#x27; or Macos&#x27; usability, it&#x27;s even the opposite I would say. reply paol 18 hours agorootparentThere is a huge blindspot, I&#x27;ve noticed, where people mistake familiarity for ease of use (and other qualities too).

This was on clear display when Linus Tech Tips did their Linux challenge a year or two ago.

OK, that is true in a limited sense, that \"x competency\" = \"familiarity with x\", but the point is you can be a very skilled sysadmin or programmer who still makes \"noob\" mistakes trying to configure Windows just because you&#x27;re more familiar with MacOS or LinuxThis also extends beyond UI to platform concepts in general. I&#x27;ll take Unix-or-DOS-like hierarchical filesystems as an example. Even here I&#x27;ve seen people equate knowledge of a hier FS structure with inherent technical ability, when discussing those \"teens can&#x27;t use computers\" articles.

In the case of Linux Mint, which is exactly what I&#x27;d recommend to new users, that&#x27;s either by selecting to install the proprietary Nvidia drivers in the window that opens after you login, of by running a `sudo apt install linux-firmware -y` and rebooting. If the user can install drivers on Windows, then I they can google for 30 seconds and find the one or two commands to run to install their driver on Linux.On easy distros like Mint, I have to deal with maybe a tenth of the amount of bullshit that Windows throws at me, the only difference is that most users are used to handling Windows&#x27; bullshit. My 12 year old brother, who while fairly competent as a user, isn&#x27;t particularly tech-inclined, uses Mint exclusively, and he can handle just about everything, except burning the Mint USB and booting off it for the initial installation.Plus, I often see people arguing against Linux comparing its ease-of-use for users with very low tech literacy, then either acting as though those very same users could solve many problems they might across on Windows, or that they just wouldn&#x27;t come across any problems. If I installed Mint, I&#x27;m sure my grandma could barely use Mint, just like she can barely use Windows, but she would need just as much tech support on Windows, if not more due to Microsoft becoming increasingly user-hostile.And as for rude Linux users: on the rare occasions that the user actually needs help, rather than just google, in my experience people tend to just mentally facepalm a thousand times over, rather than calling them \"afraid of the command line\", despite the reputation the Linux world has. It can be a bit frustrating helping noobs, sure, but not any more than helping total noobs on Windows. At worst, people might make some jokes at your expense, but it&#x27;s pretty rare for me to actually see anything like the stereotypical rude Linux user.P.S.

Confusing and half-baked documentation (because there are dozens different way to accomplish the same thing depending on your distro and config, good luck figuring out which is the right one for you) etc. etc.A lot of these issues are not really \"bugs\" and just a natural outcome of the decentralized nature of Linux (non-kernel part) development.

As long an the users aren’t Windows-Users and believe they know computers they will be happy with a plain Linux. They update itself, they upgrade it self and they’re happy not forced into updates.

But in case of an average user, Fedora.What I mean with Windows-Users? People which believe they need to install “drivers“ themselves. Which argue against Linux anyway because it doesn’t support the weird „Desktop Metapher“ from Windows 95. And usually argue that weird hardware like 3D-Shutterglasses or some kind of HDR-Something (just insert here some hot new stuff) isn’t supported. The broad majority of users don’t want that and don’t need it. What matters is HiDPI-Scaling (good, with exception of the awful thing named Electron) and easy to configure sound-system (Pipewire nailed it). And unification of which we achieved through Linux, LIBC&#x2F;LIBSTDC++, Coretuils and finally Systemd and Flatpak. The point here is the chain of parts building upon each other.Recommendations Stay away from Nvidia. Use old ThinkPads if you have not special requirements. Use printers with AirPrint (IPP-Everywhere).Teaching I would be happy if people start teaching the users to read the interface (like a book or an info grahic), think and then act. Input, Process, Output. TUIs foster that and I think that is why users accustomed to them love them - and dislike most GUIs and nearly all websites.What computer courses do for decades? Not teaching users using the interface. They just drill them to click on a specific icon (once, or twice or with the wrong mouse button).

It&#x27;s almost always kernel updates, but I had the sound suddenly stop working on a Kubuntu install after a kernel update, and I&#x27;ve had a few cases where the new kernel wouldn&#x27;t even boot and I had to drop back to the old one.These types of things are hard to quantify.

Windows and Linux are OSes that are downloadable from the web or buyable from stores and Windows consumer hardware support is simply better. And that’s okay, there are people who will seek devices that support it better, but I am not one of them, I will just virtualize it or run it in WSL.If Linux had 30% desktop market share that would change, but it doesn’t.FWIW, I agree with most criticisms of Windows. It is clear Microsoft no longer treats Windows the OS as a product, they treat every individual piece of it as a product, and that’s resulting in some weird, ugly, user hostile shit, but I can still get rid of it in no time at all and have a better personal OS.

They got rid of a lot of nice things in the UI like ability to move the toolbar (what Microsoft calls taskbar) to the right (hiding it completely would be nice but of course you can&#x27;t have that without unreliable 3rd party scripts), shoved MS account through users&#x27; throat, introduced \"lock screen\" mess which you can&#x27;t disable while breaking on battery behavior. In my case it made my laptop completely unusable on battery as I either need to type my password 30 times an hour and&#x2F;or deal with screen going dark because of \"inactivity\". No matter how many settings I disabled the behavior is still there. It&#x27;s widely reported on the Internet but pleas to Microsoft to just let us use our computer in peace by disabling lock screen and screen dimming are unanswered.So now Windows forces you to use Microsoft account, shoves ads and crapware into your face (even in \"pro\" version), makes significant part of your vertical screen real estate unusable because of popping up toolbar like in good old days of internet browsers, makes using laptops on battery a mess. They removed a lot more options to tweak the UI. It&#x27;s just full on assault on usability. It really does seem like they want to get rid of power users so they can continue shoving more ads and dark patterns on remaining ones. Like those Nigerian Prince scammers who make glaring grammar errors in their emails so people with any kind of critical thinking skills won&#x27;t bother them responding.If you wonder why I upgraded - I really didn&#x27;t want to but at some point they must&#x27;ve sneaked a dialog somewhere where I had a habit of clicking through and to my surprise it was Windows 11 from now on.

I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about with a toolbar though, the only thing of size that pops up on mine is the start menu. Unless that&#x27;s the new search thing I disabled.I dunno. On balance, I LOVED Windows 7, Windows 8 was a mess, Windows 10 was... more or less just 7 with an uglier and more confusing interface, and if anything, 11 is a step back towards 7 in my mind, both in aesthetics and usability. Though I was also never one for the side taskbar, so if that&#x27;s your bag, I can absolutely see you not enjoying it being gone. Other positives:- They&#x27;re finally reunifying settings into a single interface, hopefully they finish this time before starting a new one- New display configuration options are much more sanely organized- I&#x27;ve had just, WAY fewer issues with drivers in generalSome negs:- Audio settings are now in five places, any of which can and can not apply to whatever you&#x27;re doing, seemingly on the fly- They replaced the context menu with a different context menu that&#x27;s only slightly different and instead of just carrying over old options with some sensible defaults, hid them in a sub-context context menu which just... ughMacOS is still bae though. And that&#x27;s probably why I like 11 okay is because it feels distinctly like Microsoft chasing Apple with regard to OS design. But as someone who would definitely consider myself a power user, I have no issues using 11. It&#x27;s an improvement on 10, IMO, which was a distinct downgrade from 7 but itself was a massive upgrade from the train-wreck that was 8, so overall the trajectory is acceptable. reply bluecalm 18 hours agorootparentGood thing you reminded me of context menus when right clicking on files.

It wasn&#x27;t completely there...for example, the Candy Crush ads were still there in the start menu, but the direction relative to 8 was good. However, Windows 11 (and moreso Edge) shows that MS never really had that realization and continues to see their software not as tools for the users to use to simplify and improve their lives but as \"products\" to be used exactly as MS wants us to use it.My disillusionment with macOS also lies with this attitude.For me, Linux is the only desktop OS to be used by choice anymore. reply TheCoelacanth 18 hours agorootparentMS doesn&#x27;t think their software is tools for their users to use; they think their users are tools for their software to use. reply xtracto 11 hours agorootparentprevWindows 7 UI was great.

Between that and Linux getting a lot better at running the (relatively few) games I play, I decided to get rid of Windows and just use that drive as extra storage. reply wharvle 16 hours agorootparentMost of the people I know who run Windows personally (not at&#x2F;for work) either do it only because gaming&#x27;s easiest&#x2F;best there, or because it&#x27;s easy to get free or extremely-cheap used Windows machines that&#x27;ll hold up for a year or so (then get another when they break) [EDIT] And actually that last category&#x27;s a single person I know who&#x27;s a writer, so wants a laptop with a keyboard but only uses an old word processor on it, and email, nothing else.Exceptions are my relatives over age 60, who barely do anything with their computers and should probably just have Chromebooks or iPads + keyboard (god, they could really use the accessibility features...), but are used to computer = walk into Costco or Best Buy and buy a desktop tower.Most non-gamers who also aren&#x27;t computer nerds, whom I know, \"compute\" mainly on their phone anyway.

The settings panel finally makes sense, though not everything has been migrated yet. Windows updates are way more reliable. Windows PowerToys provides almost everything power users may need. The updated windows management is just awesome, simple to use and provides a good amount of options. Notepad is now a real text editor, the screenshot tool supports recording too, Edge competes with other modern browsers and has some unique features such as windows splitting.That’s just a subsets of some things that improved, there is way more.

The company issues MacBooks unless you ask for a Windows laptop. Most of my co-workers in California grew up using Macs and love them. Whereas it seems that, for some reason, the majority of the non-Californian employees grew up using Windows.My current manager came from Microsoft and was the one that pointed this out to me (because, like you, I also have always hated MacOS ... before our company started issuing Windows laptops to those who request them I tried really hard to get used to it and just couldn&#x27;t). My manager&#x27;s claim, though I&#x27;m not sure how accurate it is, is that Apple seems to have a cultural hold within California, with lots of businesses using them as well as consumers ... but outside of the state Microsoft has the hold. Again, it&#x27;s a hypothesis, I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any validity to it ... but I&#x27;m curious if there could be some truth to it. reply freedomben 18 hours agorootparentI think that hypothesis is correct, and has spread to tech startups in general (primarily web-based tech startups). I have never lived in California but have many other places around the country, and with many different companies, and that is definitely in-line with what I&#x27;ve seen as well.The other factor (related somewhat but not completely) I think is that Apple has become a status symbol. People who chose Windows were rare, and got lots of shit for picking Windows. The peer pressure made the majority of people either stick with macOS even if they didn&#x27;t like it, or switch at the refresh cycle (and make sure to announce that was their intention anytime they got shit for having a windows laptop). Usually I was the only one on Linux, and there&#x27;d be one other person on Windows who didn&#x27;t care about the pressue, but 99% of everybody would go with the flow. reply tim333 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m one of the macOS folk.

I downloaded the Windows 7 Beta when I was 12 years old (and still think it&#x27;s the best UI any OS has ever had). When I was in college I used Linux more, but found that the only reason I used it was as glorified desktop customization software. All of my assignments were in Java and my personal projects were in C.I switched to a chromebook halfway through college and did all my assignments by SSHing into a rented VPS running Ubuntu. After college I finally got some money and bought some used thinkpads, which I ran Windows on.My first job out of college we had macbook pros, and I hated those frickin things. The UI was so opinionated and slow with all of its animations. There was no way to disable the paneled desktops and there was no built in package manager or tiling window manager. Their bash version (this was pre-zsh) was an ancient build from 2007 and their coreutils lacked all the neat GNU extensions features (I recommend anybody who uses a macbook immediately install coreutils from homebrew and also upgrade bash). I had a million things I hated about macOS and still do.Other companies let me choose between a mac and a PC, and I went with PC. My current company gave me a Macbook pro and I haven&#x27;t turned the thing on in a year. I use my desktop PC for everything. I like powershell, Windows Terminal, Winget&#x2F;Chocolatey, vcpkg, Visual Studio, and MSVC language features like SAL. DirectX11 blows OpenGL out of the water in terms of syntax without getting as complicated as Vulkan. I prefer the Win32 API Convention of initializing things with structs and getting more descriptive return types to Linux&#x27;s everything-is-an-int.

I can only speak for myself, but I&#x27;ve been a Windows user since 95. All but one of my programming jobs over the last 20 years have also been working on Windows. But I really dislike the direction Microsoft are taking and I find Windows to be terribly slow these days, with each version seemingly worse than the previous one. So I decided to look elsewhere.A couple of months ago I bought a new laptop with the express intention of running Linux on it and giving it a good college try (I didn&#x27;t want to mess around with dual-booting and I still need Windows on my main PC for work... for now). I know very little about Linux, but I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m not going to use Windows past 10 so it&#x27;s time to find something else.I went with Debian running dwm (Debian because I value stability over everything else, and dwm because I like the suckless philosophy) and it&#x27;s honestly surprised me how good it&#x27;s been. It&#x27;s SO snappy. Everything is instant. It&#x27;s really been a breath of fresh air.I was especially dreading programming since I&#x27;ve solely used Visual Studio since Visual C++ 4.0 and don&#x27;t really know anything else. Anyway, I went all-in and started learning Vim, GDB, and Make, and boy do I feel like I&#x27;ve been missing out. I&#x27;m really enjoying programming again, which for me has just become a job over the years.Anyway, my point is, if tech-literate people are willing to give Linux a try, I wonder how many of them would be as surprised as I was and may make the switch permanently. With Windows getting worse, and Linux getting better, maybe more than ever. reply freedomben 17 hours agoparentPeople occassionally ask me what my best advice is for becoming a great programmer, and they are surprised when I say vim, bash (including for and while loops), and core tools like sed, grep, awk&#x2F;cut.When you know enough bash to (without having to look it up every time) write a command that filters (sed) and parses (awk, cut) and then loops (while, for) you will be amazed at what you can do and how quickly you can do it.

In this case it&#x27;s better to leave the real Linux Chrome UA than to risk being detected by discrepancies between the UA and the browser capabilities detected by JS. reply rldjbpin 57 minutes agoparentprevsame thing next year then? reply hakcermani 19 hours agoparentprevHope it is the inflexion point ! moved to Linux (Ubuntu on Framework-13) since Nov 2022, not going back into walled gardens ! reply ParetoOptimal 17 hours agoparentprevSometimes I wonder if SteamOS being seamless and having a handy switch to desktop feature is what will bring about the year of the Linux desktop.Maybe if they defaulted to plasma mobile?I don&#x27;t see most casual users plugging a keyboard and mouse into the steam deck. reply hospitalJail 19 hours agoparentprevI remember some MLM pusher telling me back in 2009 that smartphones were going to take off or something because it hit some magic 2-4% threshold.I genuinely think Windows got worse, and Linux people started recommending Fedora instead of Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian-branch.Microsoft pushes us away, good Linux distros keep us from going back. reply ejb999 19 hours agoparentprev... again. reply AlienRobot 18 hours agoparentprevWhen the year of linux desktop comes,it won&#x27;t be because linux became better than windows,but because windows became worse than linux. reply moffkalast 18 hours agorootparentBoth, it&#x27;s both, and they&#x27;re meeting in the middle. Windows has taken a nosedive with 11, while I can say at least for KDE that it has been improving massively in stability over the past few years, and Proton has made gaming on Linux possible. Adobe being Windows-only is still a big hold for lots of people, but unlike decades ago, today lots of top software like Davinci Resolve is now nativelly compatible.

ChromeOS is a distribution of Linux, unlike say Android even advertising official support for a Debian container to run Linux desktop software, and while it lacks GNU utils, Alpine does too and yet we still include it in this category...Next is the whole way we&#x27;re counting the supposed number of Linux computers: user agents. There&#x27;s zero reason for browsers to provide true and specific user agents, in fact, true user agents often yield broken sites (like YouTube assuming ARM PCs are all a specific Chinese smart TV) or pose a great privacy risk. Certainly a significant percentage of Linux users made the choice against it, either by themselves or as a browser default.Then there&#x27;s the fact specific demographics have their own distribution of platforms. For example, StackOverflow developer survey showed 40.23% of developers prefer Linux for personal use, compared to 31.07% who prefer MacOS. The absolute numbers matter little if your users in particular tend to be on a certain platform. reply itsoktocry 19 hours agoparent>I find this sort of metric rather pointless...As a complete outsider, it might seem odd.But I think tech people recognize this as referring to \"OS&#x27;s that aren&#x27;t Windows or Mac\". reply randomdata 16 hours agorootparent> But I think tech people recognize this as referring to \"OS&#x27;s that aren&#x27;t Windows or Mac\".Do they?

Consumers don&#x27;t care what servers their favorite sites and services are running on: they don&#x27;t have to manage it. reply gitaarik 5 hours agorootparentThere are also people that prefer to use free &#x2F; open-source software because of it giving power & control to the users & community, opposed to proprietary software where a single (typically commercial) company controls the software.The disadvantage of propietary software is that you are at the mercy of how the company decides to maintain and develop their software. And they might do undesirable things towards their users. Like displaying adds, tracking &#x2F; profiling their user&#x27;s personal data. Changing the pricing. This typically happens when they gain enough market share and have enough users vedor-locked into their software.And the vendor lock-in also makes it harder for users to make the software work with other 3rd party software. So generally propietary software isn&#x27;t easy to combine with third party software, unless the company has a commercial incentive to support it. But often one of the reasons for the software to be propietary is because of the vendor lock-in. So that you will use all software from 1 company that all works well together, but doesn&#x27;t work (as well) when trying to combine it with third party software. reply ascagnel_ 19 hours agorootparentprev> Not really.

The body of the article reports 6.24% desktop Linux penetration already.The 4% reported in the headline refers to browsers which report Linux in the user-agent string.

In December, 23andMe admitted that hackers had stolen the genetic and ancestry data of 6.9 million users, nearly half of all its customers. The data breach started with hackers accessing only around 14,000 user accounts. The hackers broke into this first set of victims by brute-forcing accounts with passwords that were known to be associated with the targeted customers, a technique known as credential stuffing. From these 14,000 initial victims, however, the hackers were able to then access the personal data of the other 6.9 million million victims because they had opted-in to 23andMe’s DNA Relatives feature. This optional feature allows customers to automatically share some of their data with people who are considered their relatives on the platform. In other words, by hacking into only 14,000 customers’ accounts, the hackers subsequently scraped personal data of another 6.9 million customers whose accounts were not directly hacked. But in a letter sent to a group of hundreds of 23andMe users who are now suing the company, 23andMe said that “users negligently recycled and failed to update their passwords following these past security incidents, which are unrelated to 23andMe.” “Therefore, the incident was not a result of 23andMe’s alleged failure to maintain reasonable security measures,” the letter reads. Zavareei said that 23andMe is “shamelessly” blaming the victims of the data breach. “This finger pointing is nonsensical. 23andMe knew or should have known that many consumers use recycled passwords and thus that 23andMe should have implemented some of the many safeguards available to protect against credential stuffing — especially considering that 23andMe stores personal identifying information, health information, and genetic information on its platform,” Zavareei said in an email. “The breach impacted millions of consumers whose data was exposed through the DNA Relatives feature on 23andMe’s platform, not because they used recycled passwords. Of those millions, only a few thousand accounts were compromised due to credential stuffing. 23andMe’s attempt to shirk responsibility by blaming its customers does nothing for these millions of consumers whose data was compromised through no fault of their own whatsoever,” said Zavareei.

In response to 23andMe’s letter, Dante Termohs, a 23andMe customer who was impacted by the data breach, told TechCrunch that he found “it appalling that 23andMe is attempting to hide from consequences instead of helping its customers.” 23andMe’s lawyers argued that the stolen data cannot be used to inflict monetary damage against the victims. “The information that was potentially accessed cannot be used for any harm. As explained in the October 6, 2023 blog post, the profile information that may have been accessed related to the DNA Relatives feature, which a customer creates and chooses to share with other users on 23andMe’s platform. Such information would only be available if plaintiffs affirmatively elected to share this information with other users via the DNA Relatives feature. Additionally, the information that the unauthorized actor potentially obtained about plaintiffs could not have been used to cause pecuniary harm (it did not include their social security number, driver’s license number, or any payment or financial information),” the letter read. 23andMe and one of its lawyers did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. After disclosing the breach, 23andMe reset all customer passwords, and then required all customers to use multi-factor authentication, which was only optional before the breach. In an attempt to pre-empt the inevitable class action lawsuits and mass arbitration claims, 23andMe changed its terms of service to make it more difficult for victims to band together when filing a legal claim against the company. Lawyers with experience representing data breach victims told TechCrunch that the changes were “cynical,” “self-serving” and “a desperate attempt” to protect itself and deter customers from going after the company. Clearly, the changes didn’t stop what is now a flurry of class action lawsuits.

They also have a feature that grants those 14k compromised accounts effective access to 6.9 million accounts.23andMe then claims that poor password practices are responsible for this data leak.> “Therefore, the incident was not a result of 23andMe’s alleged failure to maintain reasonable security measures”I&#x27;ve not run security at an org of their size, nor have i touched their service, but i have to imagine there were some patterns to this breach that would have been reasonable to account for ahead of time. Did those 14k accounts also have their email provider accounts compromised? Could a login ip-range check have prevented all of this? 2FA seems like an obvious answer here but clearly that was more than could be expected. reply dpkonofa 16 hours agoparentThere was no brute forcing done. The credentials were from other sites that were leaked via Tor and the users on 23andMe used the same email&#x2F;password combo. That’s why you don’t reuse passwords, when possible.Nothing on 23andme’s end failed unless you consider someone using a correct user&#x2F;pass combo while not being the owner as a fail on the part of 23andMe rather than the end user. reply uses 16 hours agorootparentIn 2023 an org of their size and with such sensitive data needs to give a bit more of a fuck about who is accessing users&#x27; accounts. Mass leakage of potentially reused credentials is an ancient concept at this point and should have been on their radar as an attack to protect their users&#x27; data against. Basically, they shouldn&#x27;t have just been relying on passwords to authenticate users. Many orgs of their size and with much less sensitive information than the literal genetic data of their users do a lot better. reply dpkonofa 15 hours agorootparentAnd how would they know that when the access was done via the correct user&#x2F;pass combo for accounts where the users chose not to enable MFA? reply evan_ 15 hours agorootparentIf the user logs in from a device we haven&#x27;t seen before, or they haven&#x27;t logged in for more than a year (or six months, or two weeks etc), send them an email challenge.Maybe the email address on file is also cracked but it&#x27;ll make it harder, and it&#x27;s more work for the attackers. reply g-b-r 14 hours agorootparentKeep in mind that will force everyone who doesn&#x27;t keep cookies to have to do that at every login.Github is like that right now, and it&#x27;s quite a pita; sure, it&#x27;s not a great idea to continually delete all cookies without exceptions, but in some cases it&#x27;s currently hard to avoid it (low-end smartphones where Firefox is too heavy) reply evan_ 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true. Also, if I cut my keyboard in half, it&#x27;s a lot harder to use Google Docs.I sympathize, but at a certain point if you&#x27;ve gone out of your way to disable the features that the developers have added to make your life easier, you just don&#x27;t get to complain about it. reply g-b-r 10 hours agorootparentAt least don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s \"developers making my life easier\"... reply JeremyNT 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable compromise though if you can&#x27;t force MFA for some reason. There are many sites which do this today.You don&#x27;t even need to rely on the cookie if you&#x27;re worried about the ux for cookie clearers. You could also whitelist an IP address (or even a subnet) when they verify the email, and it would have been \"good enough\" to prevent this particular situation. reply g-b-r 10 hours agorootparentYes true (if you do use cookies though it&#x27;s probably better to let the user disable the check, after explaining the risks) reply octopoc 15 hours agorootparentprevIf they don&#x27;t have MFA enabled, don&#x27;t let them see other people&#x27;s DNA. That way person A choosing bad security only endangers person A. reply dpkonofa 13 hours agorootparentYou can&#x27;t see just anyone&#x27;s DNA. You have to opt-in to the program and share it with specific users, in nearly every case someone who is a distant relative that is tantamount to a stranger. reply MichaelZuo 11 hours agorootparentI think folks are just angry that it turns out some small fraction of their distant cousins are incompetent at password security. reply croutonwagon 15 hours agorootparentprevMany orgs will use location and connection types to filter this.For example if i proxy my connections through a VPS or VPN i will OFTEN either be outright denied access, or at best get sent to a validation step (most often they shoot the email an verification code that i have to plug in).I will often route traffic through a linode for reasons. And sometimes use a VPN here and there (ie: mullvad). In almost all cases this will trigger anti-spam measures on sites, some so intrusive its borderline unusable (ie: Youtube and google with recpatcha). reply tsimionescu 15 hours agorootparentprevWhy is that an option, given how sensitive the data is? Why are they not actively monitoring HIBP for their users? reply dpkonofa 15 hours agorootparentYou don’t know that they weren’t. HIBP is not omniscient. It doesn’t automatically get a list of leaked account info unless that info is published publically. Based on the current evidence I’ve seen so far, that’s not the case. It seems like the breached data was sold privately on the dark web and was tested for months via a botnet. It also seems like the leaked data included either IPs or last known login location info which means someone with a sizable enough botnet could have used that info to login from nearby locations, thereby bypassing any prompts triggered by “new locations”. reply rsanek 15 hours agorootparentprevThey have an email right? Many services automatically detect suspicious logins and asks for additional verification even if the user hasn&#x27;t specifically turned on MFA. reply dpkonofa 15 hours agorootparentThat’s the problem. There wasn’t anything suspicious. From what I’ve read, the “hackers” used a botnet, aided with location&#x2F;IP data from the leak. There would be nothing suspicious about a login with the correct email and password coming from the right location. reply turquoisevar 10 hours agorootparentprevThey had no issue making MFA mandatory after the fact, so they should’ve had no issues making it mandatory before the fact.> After disclosing the breach, 23andMe reset all customer passwords, and then required all customers to use multi-factor authentication, which was only optional before the breach.As others have pointed out, there are also other options. Such as an email challenge when noticing high traffic, or damn, even when noticing a new login from a new device or IP that is unfamiliar. Many services do this all the time.We’re talking about raw DNA data here that is accessible. You’d expect levels of security as implemented by banks if not better, not “Little Timmy’s first blog” levels of carelessness. reply dpkonofa 9 hours agorootparent> We’re talking about raw DNA data here that is accessibleNo, we’re not. Have you ever used 23andMe before? reply turquoisevar 5 hours agorootparentYes we are and yes I have. Have you?They’ve temporary disabled it due to this data breach, but you were able to download your raw data[0] and then use it as you see fit.I, for example, downloaded mine and used OSGenome[1] to crawl through it and parse it as well as Promethease[2].So maybe save your downvote next time until you know what you’re talking about.0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;yQc9xXP1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mentatpsi&#x2F;OSGenome2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promethease.com reply TheCapn 15 hours agorootparentprevWould be interesting to know how they were testing authentication. Were they using a botnet of any sort? Otherwise for every \"valid\" user&#x2F;pass combo from an external leak they tested there&#x27;d be several failures. A single (or multiple) hosts smashing auth attempts should raise flags. They didn&#x27;t \"Brute force\" one user account at a time, but they did brute force the authentication system in general. reply dpkonofa 12 hours agorootparentThe current info that&#x27;s been released seems to indicate that they used a botnet over the course of several months and had access to the \"last known login location\". So there wasn&#x27;t any \"smashing\" happening and no \"you&#x27;re signing in from a different location\" blocks either. reply SAI_Peregrinus 13 hours agorootparentprevNIST SP 800-63B \"Digital Identity Guidelines\" specifically requires preventing users from setting passwords which are known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. reply dpkonofa 13 hours agorootparentHow would you know they&#x27;re compromised before you know they&#x27;re compromised? According to the info I&#x27;ve read about this, the site and database that was breached was not published publicly but was sold privately on the dark web. reply _tom_ 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s fairly common to do traffic analysis, and look for behavior that is not typical. Things like a sudden jump in the data being downloaded, access from other countries, changes in IP addresses, log ins from new sites.There are many security tools that use AI to identify patterns of access and alert on changes.So, yes, something like this could be detectable. reply starttoaster 15 hours agorootparentprev> where the users chose not to enable MFA?Require MFA to be enabled when it&#x27;s an issue of indirect access to personal data of potentially millions of other users on the site. Any retort like \"okay well that might just hurt the platform&#x27;s ability to attract users with that sort of security prescription,\" gets cement shoes in the bay. There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to allow known dated forms of authentication to access user data of other 23andMe subscribers. Of course people are lazy and won&#x27;t enable it if nobody is telling them they have to, most people are completely ignorant to how rampant these kinds of stories are because they don&#x27;t subscribe to tech news. Somebody needs to be the adult and force people into the correct lane. reply Fatnino 13 hours agorootparentprevThey should have worked with haveibeenpwnd to proactively warn their users who are detected to have been using recycled and leaked passwords. reply dpkonofa 13 hours agorootparentThat assumes that haveibeenpwnd knew about this leak which would only be possible if the leaked data was posted publicly. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have been as the hacker was looking to sell the information. reply disgruntledphd2 15 hours agorootparentprevI mean, the right thing would have been to force password changes for the breached accounts. This is doable through have I been owned etal, right? reply dpkonofa 15 hours agorootparentHow would they know which passwords were breached? The data leak was from a different site and not from 23andme. Additionally, current evidence suggests that the breach was not known on haveibeenpwned prior to it being used and the reused credentials were tested over a period of months using a botnet. reply flandish 14 hours agorootparentprevSimple. Require MFA. reply mc32 15 hours agorootparentprevTotally agree.Orgs with this kind of data will at least track geolocation and maybe device information and require proof despite a correct password as well as attempts to access multiple accounts from an address block. Many also incorporate the have I been owned leaked password database .The have to act responsible when handling and caring for this kind of data. It’s irresponsible not to. reply toomuchtodo 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re not providing secure MFA as an option and invalidating breached credential pairs via HIBP, you’re negligent as an idp. 23andme failed hard, and they should own it.FFS, default to magic link login via email if you have to. At least then you&#x27;re relying on Google, Apple, or someone else for auth (in most cases of unsophisticated users). reply dpkonofa 16 hours agorootparentIt is an option. Every user has the option to setup MFA when they set up their account. The fact that people reused their passwords and chose not to setup MFA is not 23andme’s fault. reply toomuchtodo 16 hours agorootparentAs a 23andme user who has filed a complaint with the FTC, purposely opted out of arbitration and intending to join a class action, and is responsible for customer IAM at a fintech, I politely disagree. Poor IAM and AAA decisions are a choice, and there must be consequences for resulting harm. reply brvsft 15 hours agorootparentLol, enjoy your $20 because someone reused their password. reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t care about the money, let the lawyers and regulators extract. That is the incentive mechanism. reply dpkonofa 16 hours agorootparentprevnext [12 more] [flagged] toomuchtodo 16 hours agorootparentI absolutely have an axe to grind against consumer harm incurred by lazy and&#x2F;or negligent technology companies (all companies, really, just scoping for this convo). Guilty as charged. When good behavior is not forthcoming, spin up regulators and the legal framework.EDIT: I do not believe this is an unreasonable position to take. Years ago, I interviewed with the CTO of 23andme and almost took an infra job there (comp too low) ~12 years ago. I am a customer. I have mostly good things to say about them as an org. That is not a free pass when you do harm. Do better, it is not hard. reply dpkonofa 16 hours agorootparentIt’s not lazy or negligent on the part of the website when they offer additional security and users choose not to use it. 23andMe asks multiple times for users to set up 2FA and apps like 1Password and Bitwarden recognize that it’s available and prompt users to set it up. reply function_seven 15 hours agorootparentIt is when those users&#x27; passwords unlock not just their own data, but that of millions of other users as well.Alice could have set up 2FA and adhered to all the best practices, but she still got her data stolen because Bob used \"hunter2\" and was hacked.14,000 accounts compromised, 7 million users&#x27; data taken. There&#x27;s no way 23andMe should be able to offload their responsibilities to Alice&#x27;s cousin Bob. reply dpkonofa 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not what happened. The 7 million users didn&#x27;t have their data stolen. The compromised accounts had access to data that those users opted-in to share with those accounts.Imagine that you have a bank account and you share access to it with a family member. If they use \"Password1\" for their password and someone gets into their account and then, by extension, has access to whatever level of access you&#x27;ve provided them to your account, is that the bank&#x27;s fault? Is it yours? Is it your family member&#x27;s? reply function_seven 9 hours agorootparentYour analogy doesn&#x27;t fit here. There is no scenario where accessing the accounts of 14,000 banking clients would then blow up to several million clients&#x27; accounts. Any bank that even offered this \"feature\" would, yes, be at fault.There seems to be some transitiveness going on here. Let&#x27;s go with the banking scenario: I give my son access to my checking account, and I also give my business partner access. My son is a dumbass, and uses the same password for everything. Now my business partner&#x27;s info is taken. His parents get hacked as well.From 14,000 to 7,000,000 is quite the amplification. That&#x27;s on 23andMe and nobody else. reply robertlagrant 15 hours agorootparentprev> When good behavior is not forthcomingThe only bad behaviour, not that I&#x27;d choose that terminology, I&#x27;m aware of was password reuse.

This won&#x27;t always catch password reuse attacks (now called \"credential stuffing\", I think), and is only a partial mitigation. reply dpkonofa 15 hours agorootparentprevThis assumes the breached password occurrence was known in advance and, from what I have read so far about this, was not the case with the 23andMe accounts. reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agorootparentI will eat crow if it comes to light that this was entirely unavoidable on 23andme&#x27;s part. reply dpkonofa 15 hours agorootparentYou won’t have to. They could have forced MFA and been done with it. That doesn’t make it their fault that they didn’t. It just means they could have done better and assumed that at least some users (read: most) are ignorant about best practices with sensitive data. It’s not something they would be legally culpable for, though. replygodelski 15 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately the majority of people aren&#x27;t very tech literate. We have to remember HN is far from average. The company I work for forces MFA and I think if you have sensitive data like this, yes, you should force MFA. Truth be told, it&#x27;s not going to enter the public lexicon until some big players start forcing adoption. Rule of thumb: if my grandma wouldn&#x27;t know to do it, I shouldn&#x27;t expect my users to do it. If you expect your users to use bad practices, then you&#x27;re not doing your job well. Idk if we should say it&#x27;s somebody&#x27;s fault when that somebody is a non-expert and is making a reasonable choice. reply crazygringo 15 hours agorootparentprevBut they did provide secure MFA as an option, and it seems the credential pairs hadn&#x27;t shown up in HIBP because they had been privately purchased via the hack of a different site. The logins were even using locations that matched previous ones.So how did 23andme fail so hard here? Literally nothing you&#x27;ve suggested would have prevented this. reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agorootparent> But they did provide secure MFA as an option> So how did 23andme fail so hard here? Literally nothing you&#x27;ve suggested would have prevented this.They made MFA mandatory after getting popped, at the same time they changed their Terms of Service to attempt to evade liability. Why did they wait to get popped? Either negligence or an active decision was made to avoid support costs and engineering time for mandatory MFA was made. Also, a magic link I suggested would&#x27;ve solved for this, unless attackers were going to get into everyone&#x27;s inbox with leaked creds to get the link to login and get that session token. Definitely more effort than credential spraying 23andme login endpoints.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;07&#x2F;23andme-ancestry-myheritag...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.23andme.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;enhanced-customer-security... reply crazygringo 14 hours agorootparentA magic link is just a form of 2FA. And the reason not to make 2FA mandatory isn&#x27;t about engineering costs -- they&#x27;d already built it. It&#x27;s because a lot of users don&#x27;t like it. I personally despise sites that require a magic link rather than a password, because it takes me 30s to log in instead of 1s.There are lots of commenters here on HN in this story saying they don&#x27;t think sites should make 2FA mandatory. There are lots of usability problems with 2FA as well -- if you lose a device or when traveling.You&#x27;re basically saying that sites that allow you to log in with just a password, if you choose, shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to exist. That seems unreasonable to me. reply toomuchtodo 13 hours agorootparent> You&#x27;re basically saying that sites that allow you to log in with just a password, if you choose, shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to exist. That seems unreasonable to me.I&#x27;m saying sites that host information of value, such as genetic information, should not be allowed to support login with just a password. That seems reasonable to me, and a regulatory gap to be closed. If you don&#x27;t want to use MFA or other secure auth systems on Reddit or Twitter, by all means, I&#x27;d agree that secure auth for low value systems might be overly burdensome to a user population. There are well worn paths if you lose MFA (remote identity proofing, mailing an OTP to known addresses, dinging a credit card $1, etc) that are all reasonable and affordable to implement.Is your argument that the data 23andme hosts is not of value or sensitive and it should not matter if their security story is lacking (\"just passwords are fine, yolo\")?EDIT: I think we fundamentally disagree on the issue. reply crazygringo 13 hours agorootparent> such as genetic information, should not be allowed to support login with just a password. That seems reasonable to meBut that isn&#x27;t obviously reasonable to me, that we need a law for that.What if I don&#x27;t think a bunch of estimates based on a bunch of my gene readings is all that valuable? Why not let me choose to use just a password?But if I do think it&#x27;s super valuable, then I can use 2FA. (And also obviously choose not to share any of my information with anyone else on the site.)Why should it be the government&#x27;s job to remove that choice from me? reply CrendKing 2 hours agorootparentHow about a middle ground, where if I set up MFA on my account, I automatically disable the access from \"distant relative\" who haven&#x27;t setup MFA, even if I want to share my data with them. Because fundamentally this incident is not serious if such transitive access was not employed in the first place.And since this is a specific access pattern for 23andme, I agree we shouldn&#x27;t involve government here. replyitsdrewmiller 9 hours agorootparentprevDo you think google is deactivating people based on HIBP? If not why do you think everyone else should? reply toomuchtodo 9 hours agorootparentGoogle defaults to Passkeys now [1], and has very aggressive heuristics around logging in [2]. They also maintain their own version of HIBP internally [3], and will force a password change [4] under certain circumstances.They are doing this because when they have high assurance of your identity (and your account hasn&#x27;t been taken over), that is the best time to issue the cryptographic credential (the Passkey) which improves go forward security of the account. Over time, accounts should filter over to Passkeys, and at some point, they will likely deprecate passwords (or require high confidence you are you to login with just username and password, vs a Passkey). I&#x27;ve had a discussion with someone on the project at Google, and they could only say \"stay tuned\" about what comes next.

Generally, we do expect recourse on the bank&#x27;s end. reply dpkonofa 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not unfair. The data that was exfiltrated is data that was accessible to the users.If someone gives their routing number and checking number to a scammer, that is also considered \"using the platform in any way other than intended\". In 99% of cases, you&#x27;d be providing that information to someone you had an actual business relationship with.

Giving that info to a total stranger would be an issue but that wouldn&#x27;t be the bank&#x27;s fault. Neither would it be the bank&#x27;s fault if you chose a poor or reused password.That&#x27;s what happened here.

There are methods to detect botnets accessing your system at scale. There are products like HIBP that can help prevent credential re-use. You can prevent logins from unusual locations with an additional factor (\"it looks like you&#x27;re accessing this website from Croatia when you&#x27;ve only ever logged in from California, check your email for a confirmation code\").

There&#x27;s sophisticated attackers that are aware of each victim&#x27;s location and can get through geolocation anomaly detection, and there&#x27;s such thing as hitting the jackpot through lucky credential stuffing, so any check for failed attempts doesn&#x27;t hit. It&#x27;s not possible to detect everything. There&#x27;s a whole lot things a serious place will do to detect naive attacks though, so a whole lot of volume there fails. It might even be good to let an obvious stuffer keep attacking you, and help us mark the accounts they have working credentials for, so we can instantly lock them and ask for password changes.I have no idea of the actual sophistication of the attackers here though: It&#x27;s way too common to see big companies that have paid no attention to prevention, and therefore will only notice an attack if it becomes an accidental denial of service attack.

It&#x27;s a law that mandates portability of medical data, some details of which overlap with privacy. reply reactordev 15 hours agorootparent\"Emerging technologies such as genealogical databases (i.e. 23andme and Ancestry) as well as wearable devices and mHealth apps have created a new risk for data privacy that is not covered by HIPAA. These digital health tools are not covered entities therefore they are not required to protect the data they collect under HIPAA. The Department of Health and Human Services nor the Office of Civil Rights have purview over this data or any breach of the consumer&#x27;s information. Any complaint regarding a breach of consumer&#x27;s health data is rejected, as there is no controlling law currently for this type of data.

Which would mean that the FTC can examine their security posture and determine if it&#x27;s adequate or what have you. Odds are they will just be slapped with a fine and back to business as usual.

For a normal end-user account on a system where no interaction between users is possible, it pretty much just affects you.For some kind of admin account with privileged access to other users&#x27; data, then it definitely affects others.One might expect increasing mandatory security measures correlating with increased potential damage of a breach.

If someone uses the password \"password1\" for some service, they should not be able to turn around and blame that service when their account is compromised.On the other hand, 23andMe should have definitely done much more to reduce the blast radius of this attack. Mandatory 2FA, disallowing known-compromised passwords, geolocation of login IPs, etc.I guess the question shakes out to: where do we draw the line on personal responsibility vs. service responsibility? Services can&#x27;t be responsible for 100% of user security.

If you opt in to a feature that shares your data with other users, you&#x27;re explicitly opting in to the risk that those users will steal&#x2F;leak&#x2F;share your data with a third party, either intentionally or through their own negligence.If 23andMe had made any claim that they took steps to force users to secure their accounts properly or that they implemented measures to prevent data exfiltration then perhaps you could argue that you should have been able to rely on those claims, but as far as I can tell 23andMe made no such claims. reply JohnMakin 16 hours agorootparentprevNot gonna bother responding to the turfer comments in this thread but they&#x27;re roughly analogous to saying \"because you use facebook it is therefore your fault when facebook leaks your data because you voluntarily shared that data with facebook.\"Legally, logically, and ethically this is an absurd argument on its face. reply dpkonofa 16 hours agorootparentTo borrow your analogy, though, Facebook (23andMe) didn’t leak anyone’s data. That’s the issue with your position.Also, the turfer comment makes you seem like a conspiracy theorist.

It happened on their site, they had the means to control&#x2F;monitor&#x2F;mitigate it. Are you saying then that if someone hacks into facebook, steals data, it is then not facebook&#x27;s responsibility that that happened because they didn&#x27;t publish the data?Even the backwards cybersecurity laws in the US don&#x27;t work that way. reply dpkonofa 15 hours agorootparentI think you’re misunderstanding what happened in this situation. Nothing was stolen from 23andMe and no 23andMe accounts were “hacked into”. The “hack” happened on another site and the hacker got a database leak of usernames and passwords for that site (not 23andMe). Some of the users of that site used the exact same email addresses and passwords for their 23andMe accounts.If you use “Hunter2” as a password for all of your accounts and AOL gets hacked, the hackers know your password is “Hunter2”. If they get into your Facebook or Gmail account because you also used “Hunter2” there, that is neither Facebook’s or Gmail’s fault. It is your own fault. reply JohnMakin 14 hours agorootparentSo now we&#x27;re playing a semantics game about what the word \"hack\" refers to in this context? users gained unauthorized access to 23andMe and used that access to get access to data, and 23andMe had full control of mitigating, monitoring, and preventing this type of attack. Is that better? Doesn&#x27;t really change my salient point at all.In your example the site is fully capable of preventing weak passwords or enforcing things like MFA that make this type of attack a lot less effective. It may surprise you to know that most websites already do this! reply dpkonofa 13 hours agorootparentNo, we&#x27;re not playing a semantics game. The access wasn&#x27;t \"unauthorized\" if the person that \"hacked\" it was using the person&#x27;s right email and password. MFA was also available and the hacked accounts did not have it enabled. It&#x27;s not 23andMe&#x27;s fault that users reused passwords and chose not to enable MFA. This isn&#x27;t about weak passwords or passwords that were known to be leaked on sites like HaveIBeenPwned. Was there more they could have done? Of course. Is it their fault? Absolutely not.

It was on another site.The only way you’d be affected by this is if you used the same password on multiple sites (where one of those sites actually had a breach) or if you shared your DNA profile (since it is opt-in) with someone that reused passwords. In the latter case, only the info you shared with that person would be accessible to someone using a compromised account.In other words, if you shared your info with someone you didn’t know and didn’t trust, your info can be used by bad actors. reply luxuryballs 16 hours agorootparentprevthat’s why I only share my profiles with people who have a strong password reply dpkonofa 16 hours agorootparentDo you share your banking info with complete strangers?

When the recipients are a large collection of random strangers on the internet, you should assume the data is as good as public, because the average random stranger on the internet has terrible security practices (not to mention the non-zero probability that they&#x27;re actively malicious).23andMe could have done a better job communicating the risks of sharing your data with random strangers on the internet, but it&#x27;s also not unreasonable for them to put some level of blame on users.

Seems like the conclusions drawn are not that it doesn&#x27;t improve security, rather it does not improve security enough to justify the added burden to users and support staff.I&#x27;d venture that this 23andMe situation is one of the scenarios where password expiration could have significantly improved the outcome, but I concede that it was a poor example for me to use. replyRebelgecko 15 hours agoparentprevIMO the problem is that even if you have the best most secure alphanumericpunctuated leetspeak 20 character password, your data was still compromised if your third cousin once removed had \"hunter2\" as their password.It&#x27;s like Cambridge Analytica- each compromised account let them dump data for hundreds to thousands of people reply ziddoap 15 hours agorootparent>your data was still compromised if your third cousin once removed had \"hunter2\" as their password.And you opted-in to share your DNA data.But yes, the entire business model of 23andMe makes me uncomfortable.

Your data only appears in another account&#x27;s ancestry data if you opted in to sharing ancestry data and they are a relative of yours. I think most people opt in, because (1) finding out about your ancestry and relatives is one of the main reasons people use services like 23andMe, and (2) even people who started using it just for the health data often get curious and start using the ancestry stuff too.23andMe counts anyone who is a 4th cousin or closer as a relative, which results in some big relative lists. Mine has 1500 other 23andMe users in it, but that might be above average. Based on 23andMe having 14 million customers, 14 000 accounts being compromised, and 6.9 million accounts having data taken via the relatives lists of those 14 000 compromised accounts, and assuming that everything that I don&#x27;t have any data on is is pretty evenly distributed (the statistical equivalent of a spherical cow) I&#x27;d guess that the average is around 700.If that&#x27;s even in the right ballpark then when you opt in to sharing this data you are opting in to share it with several hundred people, mostly complete strangers to you, mostly scattered all over the US and a few foreign countries.At that point I&#x27;m not sure if the different between just sharing it with them and sharing it with the world is meaningful. reply 1B05H1N 16 hours agoprevThey prioritized earning new business and lowering customer friction over enforcing MFA.

While it would&#x27;ve been nice if 23andMe would&#x27;ve used a service like this, can&#x27;t exactly blame them if they didn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s not like this is some well-established industry standard, but more like an extra effort by extra security-conscious companies. reply g-b-r 9 hours agorootparentYes trueWhat I&#x27;d blame 23andMe for, is having encouraged so much all that sharing of sensitive data with other accounts, without providing additional safeguards to access such data. reply kazinator 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to depend on yet another third party domain in this way.The check has low value.HaveIBeenPwned only provides value when it positively informs about a pwned password, otherwise it says nothing useful.If you&#x27;re already rejecting weak passwords using some heuristics, then the remaining passwords are unlikely to show up on that site, because, strong passwords are unlikely to be pwned, even if reused and subject to a breach. reply pompino 15 hours agorootparentprevalso there is no way to know if the usernames from the leaks are the same person as your own users. otherwise, you’re essentially saying that you have to pick a unique password that nobody else in the world is using. reply feoren 12 hours agorootparentIf everyone in the world were using 100 passwords, you&#x27;d need space for 800 billion passwords, which is 39.5 bits of entropy. Assuming an alphabet of 74 characters (lower + upper + digits + a few symbols), you&#x27;d need a little over 6 characters to make 800 billion unique passwords. A random password of 9 characters has a very low chance of overlapping any other password in the world: somewhere around Sqrt(74^9 &#x2F; 74^6.2) ~= 0.2%. That&#x27;s a 0.2% chance of overlapping any other password -- multiply that by the probability of having your password leaked for the chance that it&#x27;s on the blacklist. Make it 10+ and you&#x27;re fine. reply g-b-r 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd what&#x27;s controversial in picking a unique password that nobody else in the world is using? (and hasn&#x27;t been leaked yet, actually) reply pompino 7 hours agorootparentThere is no way to know or verify what is or isn&#x27;t a real leak, and what passwords are or aren&#x27;t leaked. We can&#x27;t settle this in the comments, and I think it&#x27;s just security theater.1. User x signs up for Service A using pwd abcd12342. User y signs up for Service B using pwd abcd12342. User z signs up for Service C using pwd abcd1234Service A is breached. Users x,y,z get emails forcing a reset of their password. Users x,y,z reset their password to abcd1245 and all is good (among many other permutations). Now Service B is breached, rinse and repeat.Depending on the workflow (the more automated it is the worse off we are), there are security vectors to exploit here by doing a carefully planned fake &#x27;leak&#x27; using mostly useless emails but only a few genuine emails to trigger pw resets, etc, etc. reply g-b-r 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re talking about, you definitely seem to have misconceptions about passwords, their math and services like haveibeenpwned.You seem to like simple passwords and think that people should use them so long as they&#x27;re not leaked. Well no, simple passwords are never good; a probably very large number of the possible ones has already been the subject of some leak, and they&#x27;re very risky in any case.Service providers (should) strive to give some protections even",

    "originBody": "[:arrow_down: Download] [:book: Command reference] [:books: Additional Documents] [:arrow_forward: Demo] container2wasm: Container to WASM converter container2wasm is a container-to-wasm image converter that enables to run the container on WASM. Converts a container to WASM with emulation by Bochs (for x86_64 containers) and TinyEMU (for riscv64 containers). Runs on WASI runtimes (e.g. wasmtime, wamr, wasmer, wasmedge, wazero) Runs on browser x86_64 or riscv64 containers are recommended. Other platforms (e.g. arm64) also work (but slow). This is an experimental software. Demo page of containers on browser (debian,python,node,vim): https://ktock.github.io/container2wasm-demo/ Examples Container Image to WASM (WASI) $ c2w ubuntu:22.04 out.wasm The above command converts ubuntu:22.04 container image to WASI image (out.wasm). NOTE1: For selecting the container image's architecture other than amd64, use --target-arch flag of c2w (e.g. c2w --target-arch=riscv64 riscv64/ubuntu:22.04 out.wasm). NOTE2: x86_64 or riscv64 container is recommended. Other platform's containers should work but slow because of additional emulation. The generated image runs on WASI runtimes: $ wasmtime out.wasm uname -a Linux localhost 6.1.0 #1 PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Jun 5 11:57:09 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux $ wasmtime out.wasm ls / bin dev home lib32 libx32 mnt proc runsrv tmp var boot etc liblib64 media opt root sbin sys usr Directory mapped from the host is accessible on the container. $ mkdir -p /tmp/share/ && echo hi > /tmp/share/from-host $ wasmtime --mapdir /mnt/share::/tmp/share out.wasm cat /mnt/share/from-host hi Please refer to ./examples/networking/wasi/ for enabling networking Container on Browser You can run the container on browser as well. There are two methods for running the container on browser. Please also refer to ./examples/wasi-browser (WASI-on-browser example) and ./examples/emscripten (emscripten example). Please refer to ./examples/networking/ for details about enabling networking. WASI on browser This example converts the container to WASI and runs it on browser. The following command generates a WASI image. $ c2w ubuntu:22.04 /tmp/out-js2/htdocs/out.wasm The following is an example of running the image on browser relying on xterm-pty and browser_wasi_shim. This example serves the image on localhost:8080 using apache http server. $ cp -R ./examples/wasi-browser/* /tmp/out-js2/ && chmod 755 /tmp/out-js2/htdocs $ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \\ -v \"/tmp/out-js2/htdocs:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/:ro\" \\ -v \"/tmp/out-js2/xterm-pty.conf:/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf:ro\" \\ --entrypoint=/bin/sh httpd -c 'echo \"Include conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf\" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf && httpd-foreground' You can run the container on browser via localhost:8080. WASI on browser with networking Container can also perform networking. This section is the demo of using curl command in the container. Tested only on Chrome. The example might not work on other browsers. $ cat > /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf && httpd-foreground' You can run the container on browser with several types of configurations: localhost:8080/?net=browser: Container with networking. Network stack c2w-net-proxy implemented based on gvisor-tap-vsock runs on browser and forwards HTTP/HTTPS packets using the browser's Fetch API. The set of accesible sites is restricted by the browser configuration (e.g. CORS restriction). See also ./examples/networking/fetch for detalis. localhost:8080/?net=delegate=ws://localhost:8888: Container with networking. You need to run user-space network stack c2w-net implemented based on gvisor-tap-vsock on the host (outside of browser). It forwards all packets received from the browser over WebSocket. See also ./examples/networking/websocket for detalis and configuration. (tested only on Linux) localhost:8080: Container without networking. emscripten on browser This example uses emscripten for converting the container to WASM. pros: WASM image size can be smaller than WASI. cons: WASI-specific optimization like Wizer pre-initialization isn't available for this mode. So the startup of the container can be slow (For x86_64 containers it might take >= 30s. For riscv64 containers it might take >= 10s). The following command generates a WASM image and a JS file runnable on browser. $ c2w --to-js ubuntu:22.04 /tmp/out-js/htdocs/ The following is an example of running the image on browser relying on xterm-pty. This example serves the image on localhost:8080 using apache http server. $ cp -R ./examples/emscripten/* /tmp/out-js/ && chmod 755 /tmp/out-js/htdocs $ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \\ -v \"/tmp/out-js/htdocs:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/:ro\" \\ -v \"/tmp/out-js/xterm-pty.conf:/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf:ro\" \\ --entrypoint=/bin/sh httpd -c 'echo \"Include conf/extra/xterm-pty.conf\" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf && httpd-foreground' You can run the container on browser via localhost:8080. NOTE: It can take some time to load and start the container. Networking can also be enabled using the user-space network stack c2w-net implemented based on gvisor-tap-vsock serving over WebSocket on the host (outside of browser). See also ./examples/networking/websocket for detalis. Getting Started requirements Docker 18.09+ (w/ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1) Docker Buildx v0.8+ (recommended) or docker build (w/ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1) You can install the converter command c2w using one of the following methods. NOTE: The output binary also contains c2w-net which a command usable for controlling networking feature (please see also ./examples/networking for details). Release binaries Binaries are available from https://github.com/ktock/container2wasm/releases Extract the tarball and put the binary somewhere under $PATH. Building binaries using make Go 1.19+ is needed. make sudo make install Command reference c2w Converts a container image into a WASM image and writes it to the specified path (default: out.wasm at the current directory). Usage: c2w [options] image-name [output file] image-name: container image name (will be pulled from the registry if it doesn't exist in Docker) [output file]: path to the result WASM file. Sub commands help, h: Shows a list of commands or help for one command Options --assets value: Custom location of build assets. --dockerfile value: Custom location of Dockerfile (default: embedded to this command) --builder value: Bulider command to use (default: \"docker\") --target-arch value: target architecture of the source image to use (default: \"amd64\") --build-arg value: Additional build arguments (please see Dockerfile for available build args) --to-js: convert the container to WASM using emscripten --debug-image: Enable debug print in the output image --show-dockerfile: Show default Dockerfile --legacy: Use \"docker build\" instead of buildx (no support for assets flag) (default:false) --help, -h: show help --version, -v: print the version Run-time flags for WASM image You can specify run-time flags to the generated wasm image for configuring the execution (e.g. for changing command to run in the container). Usage: out.wasm [options] [COMMAND] [ARG...] [COMMAND] [ARG...]: command to run in the container. (default: commands specified in the image config) Options -entrypoint: entrypoint command. (default: entrypoint specified in the image config) -no-stdin : disable stdin. (default: false) Example: The following changes the container's entrypoint to echo and pass hello to the arguments. wasmtime -- /app/out.wasm --entrypoint=echo hello Directory mapping Directory mapped from the host is accessible on the container. $ mkdir -p /tmp/share/ && echo hi > /tmp/share/hi $ wasmtime --mapdir /test/dir/share::/tmp/share /app/out.wasm ls /test/dir/share/ hi Motivation Though more and more programming languages start to support WASM, it's not easy to run the existing programs on WASM. This sometimes requires re-implementing and re-compiling them and costs extra time for development. This is a PoC converter tries to solve it by enabling running unmodified containers on WASM. How does it work contaienr2wasm creates a WASM image that runs the container and the Linux kernel on the emulated CPU. The following shows the techniqual details: Builder: BuildKit runs the conversion steps written in Dockerfile. Emulator: Bochs emulates x86_64 CPU on WASM. TinyEMU emulates RISC-V CPU on WASM. They're compiled to WASM using wasi-sdk (for WASI and on-browser) and emscripten (for on-browser). Guest OS: Linux runs on the emulated CPU. runc starts the container. Non-x86 and non-RISC-V containers runs with additional emulation by QEMU installed via tonistiigi/binfmt. Directory Mapping: WASI filesystem API makes host directories visible to the emulator. Emulators mount them to the guest linux via virtio-9p. Packaging: wasi-vfs (for WASI and on-browser) and emscripten (for on-browser) are used for packaging the dependencies. The kernel is pre-booted during the build using wizer to minimize the startup latency (for WASI only as of now). Networking: Browser's Fetch API or WebSocket is used for on-browser image. sock_* API is used for WASI. gvisor-tap-vsock can be used as the networking stack. (docs: ./examples/networking/) Security: The converted container runs in the sandboxed WASM (WASI) VM with the limited access to the host system.

Other people solving this problem have previously used a proxy to a server that does the real socket implementation. This means you can&#x27;t have a \"browser-only\" solution.The author has solved this (for HTTP&#x2F;S only) by proxying HTTP requests and then re-creating them as fetch requests (details here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ktock&#x2F;container2wasm&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples&#x2F;n...).

I suspect apps using native widgets will be great because the OS can change to UX for the app. Flutter apps on the other hand may all have to be re-shipped since they&#x27;re doing it by hand. reply tonygrue 7 hours agoparentprevI’ve used ImGui with success. I specially was also using webgpu so I used the glfw+webgpu backends. I had to fix a few issues in both halfs of the backend and there remain some little interaction bugs (mostly because browsers capture some keychords and mouse actions and you have to work around a number of them).ImGui makes a specific design choice and isn’t amazingly documented. I don’t think it’s a good choice for larger scale apps. But good for tools or UIs in games, etc.Accessibility is a nightmare with pretty much anything skipping browser layout of course. reply kelvie 8 hours agoparentprevegui [1] supports wasm.I wrote a simple chord finder for learning to play guitar with it pretty quickly [2], and would use it again to solve a problem like this, though I&#x27;m told immediate mode UI frameworks aren&#x27;t good for things other than quick prototypes, or in my case, scratching a quick itch.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.egui.rs&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kelvie.github.io&#x2F;chord-finder&#x2F; reply xyzzy_plugh 7 hours agorootparentImmediate mode UI frameworks are not inherently less appropriate than any other framework. Curious what the source of that is. reply nox101 7 hours agorootparentIn my experience Immediate mode UI frameworks are almost always not very internationalization friendly (right to left text like Arabic, problematic IME support) and, they are almost always not very accessibility friendly. Also things like system context menus to offer features like translation, system level spelling correction with the user&#x27;s custom dictionary, system password memorization and recall, word lookup, etcit&#x27;s not impossible. in fact at an API level, React is an immediate mode gui written on top of a retained mode gui. but it&#x27;s that retained mode that&#x27;s providing all the features above.which immediate mode GUIs have you used that cover these features? reply xyzzy_plugh 6 hours agorootparentIf the issue is that implementations are feature lacking, that&#x27;s a different story. The world is littered with half baked frameworks. Hell, I&#x27;ve used plenty of retained mode frameworks that lack all of those things too.My concern was moreso that there is nothing inherent to immediate mode that prevents all of those things. Someone just has to build it.RTL tends to be more of a layout problem and has little to do with UIs. Most of my experience with immediate mode UI frameworks is in proprietary applications. I will say that we had no issues with localization and we integrated well with screen readers though none of this was in a platform independent manner. And that&#x27;s usually the root of all of these issues. reply nox101 5 hours agorootparentI disagree that \"someone just has to build it.\"For example, when iOS shipped it did not have spell checking, word lookup, translation, password insertion, etc built in as context menus on text. When those features were added by the OS, every app using the native widgets got those features for free with no work on their part.Apps that rolled their own though, had to re-release their app. If they don&#x27;t have time or their app is abandoned then their users suffer.This is arguably one of the reasons flash was killed off. It was designed to render to a rectangle of pixels and it assumed a mouse and keyboard. Then smartphones appeared and no one was going to go back and fix millions of flash pages.Current apps doing their own thing will have the same problem with the next UI change (maybe vision Pro for example). replywesturner 9 hours agoparentprevCOSMIC DE (Rust-based) supports rust-windowing&#x2F;winit apps, which compile to atag in WASM.winit: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-windowing&#x2F;winit reply callalex 8 hours agoparentprevThis seems like an absolute nightmare for people with disabilities. reply echelon 10 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know about GTK, QT, and the like, but there&#x27;s a whole budding ecosystem purporting to solve it WASM-native.Dioxus [1] and about a dozen other libraries are attempting to be write-once, deploy web, mobile, desktop with native performance.

Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brandon Bell/Getty Images Austin, Texas, is the country's largest city to toss out its requirements for off-street car parking. The city hopes removing the mandates will encourage other modes of transportation and help housing affordability. Brandon Bell/Getty Images The city council in Austin, Texas recently proposed something that could seem like political Kryptonite: getting rid of parking minimums. Those are the rules that dictate how much off-street parking developers must provide — as in, a certain number of spaces for every apartment and business. Around the country, cities are throwing out their own parking requirements – hoping to end up with less parking, more affordable housing, better transit, and walkable neighborhoods. Some Austinites were against tossing the rules. \"Austin has developed as a low density city without adequate mass transportation system,\" said resident Malcolm Yeatts. \"Austin citizens cannot give up their cars. Eliminating adequate parking for residents will only increase the flight of the middle class and businesses to the suburbs.\" Consider This from NPR How Parking Explains Everything But much more numerous were voices in support of eliminating the minimums and the impact they've had on housing costs, congestion, and walkability. \"I think our country has used its land wastefully, like a drunk lottery winner that's squandered their newfound wealth,\" said resident Tai Hovanky. \"We literally paved paradise and put up a parking lot.\" The amendment sailed through the council — making Austin the biggest city in the country to eliminate its parking mandates citywide. Dozens of cities have ditched parking minimums But it's not just Austin. More than 50 other cities and towns have thrown out their minimums, from Anchorage, Alaska, and San Jose, Calif., to Gainesville, Fla. \"They're all just dead weight,\" says Tony Jordan, the president of the Parking Reform Network, of parking minimums. One issue is just how arbitrary they can be. Take bowling alleys. Jordan says the number of required parking spots per bowling lane could vary anywhere from two to five, in cities right next to each other. \"What's the difference between a bowler in city A and city B? Nothing. It's just these codes were put in ... very arbitrarily back 30 or 40 years ago and they're very hard to change because anytime the city wants to change them, there's a whole big hoopla,\" he says.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images San Francisco is one of many U.S. cities that has thrown out its parking minimums in recent years. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Random as these rules can be, they have major consequences: Parking creates sprawl and makes neighborhoods less walkable. Asphalt traps heat and creates runoff. And parking minimums can add major costs to building new housing: a single space in a parking structure can cost $50,000 or more. One 2017 study found that including garage parking increased the rent of a housing unit by about 17 percent.

So we just lose housing in exchange for having convenient places to store cars.\" A move to let the market decide Austin City Council member Zo Qadri was the lead sponsor on the resolution to remove parking mandates there. He emphasizes that getting rid of parking mandates isn't the same thing as getting rid of parking: \"It simply lets the market and individual property owners decide what levels of parking are appropriate or needed.\" Austin removed parking requirements for its downtown area a decade ago, \"and the market has still provided plenty of parking in the vast majority of the projects since then,\" says Qadri. A new survey from Pew Charitable Trusts found that 62% of Americans support property owners and builders to make decisions about the number of off-street parking spaces, instead of local governments. Angela Greco, a 36-year-old musician and copywriter in Austin, is one of them. She drives, but prefers to walk or take transit. She's not worried that doing away with the old rules will make it too hard to find a place to park. \"I've lived in like cities where it's way more difficult, like New York and L.A.,\" Greco says. \"Parking just isn't that difficult in Austin to me to begin with, even in really dense areas.\" Enlarge this image Many cities hope that ditching their parking requirements will make their neighborhoods more amenable to biking and walking.

People are seen biking and walking along Park Avenue near Grand Central Station during the Summer Streets initiative in New York City in August 2022. Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images She says the question of whether the city invests in transit and walkability, or doubles down on cars, is decisive in whether she'll live in Austin long-term. \"Like if it doesn't seem like the public transit's going to get better, and if it seems like the highway expansion is going to happen, then I'm probably going to start looking for where else I can live. ... It's a major factor in my life and my happiness. Like sometimes I'm driving on the road and I'll be in traffic or something or even just on the highway, and it's such an ugly landscape,\" Greco says. \"And then I'll think: this isn't really how I want to spend my adult life.\" Too much parking can hinder effective transit What about the idea that cities without good transit can't cut back on parking? Jonathan Levine, a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Michigan who studies transportation policy reform, says cities' parking minimums can make good transit nearly impossible to develop. \"An area that has a lot of parking is transit-hostile territory,\" he says. He explains why: When people take transit, they complete their journey by walking to their destination. A sea of parking at the destination makes that walk longer, and it makes the physical environment less appealing to those on foot. Business Street Food: Cities Turn Parking Spaces Into Dining Spots And No One Seems To Mind \"Who wants to walk by a bunch of parking lots to get to your destination?\" Levine notes. And having tons of parking encourages driving. \"If you have parking everywhere that you're going, that parking essentially is calling to the drivers, drive here! Park here! ... So if you keep on designing those areas by governmental mandate, you're creating areas that transit can't serve effectively,\" says Levine. Many more U.S. cities – including New York City, Milwaukee, and Dallas — are exploring getting rid of their parking minimums too. Duluth, Minn., lifted its parking mandates in December. Levine says getting rid of these rules is good news for cities. \"It's a huge drag on housing affordability. And it's a huge impediment for cities fulfilling their destiny, which is enabling human interaction. Because what parking does is it separates land uses, separates people. It makes cities have a much more sprawling physical profile than they otherwise would have.\" land use urban planning parking Austin, Texas Facebook Flipboard Email",

In fact there are almost no vacant parcels anywhere today, with majority latino populations now reflecting the recent waves of immigration. reply carom 14 hours agorootparentLA has extremely dysfunctional housing policy. A wave of immigration does nothing but increase demand for housing and drive up prices on rather limited stock. It has not lead to an increase in housing stock or better commercial districts. Adding more people who don&#x27;t really speak the language laws are written in doesn&#x27;t change the laws that prevent you from building vibrant cities.There is very little mixed use. Majority of the city is zoned single family. The only reason there are no parking minimums is because the California changed that law. It has nothing to do with expanded immigration. LA, despite the immigration, is in massive need of a zoning overhaul to build a vibrant city. Very little is walkable, it is very car-centric, and the zoning is the strong opposition to all of this. reply talldatethrow 5 hours agorootparentprevThere are at least 15 million illegals currently in the US.

Immigrants are more likely to go where there are jobs. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentImmigrants have a lot of motivations. Jobs are one, but unless the immigrant was recruited for a specific job (which is common) it isn&#x27;t primary. There are jobs everywhere, even in blighted cities.Immigrants with no particular job in mind look for places where the cost of living is low: they tend to have much worse job prospects than normal, so a minimum wage job in a low cost of living area is better life than double minimum wage in a high cost of living area.Immigrants often have poor English skills (or whatever the local language is). They often are used to food not common in the country. So if they can find a community of other immigrants that means people they can comfortably talk to, and also makes it more likely that someone can figure out the process of getting food they like into local stores. reply hardcopy 15 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a lot of people commenting in this thread that would benefit from reading this book... reply r00fus 17 hours agoparentprevInteresting.

We&#x27;re talking about this in a thread about parking minimums in the US, which are almost always found in cities that have approximately one car per person, or at least one car per household.In that sense, no number ever shows anything \"by itself\" because meaning is always constructed contextually, but at some point we have to all understand context because it&#x27;s both tedious and Sisyphean to spell everything out every time. reply oh_sigh 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy is 3 parking spaces per car inherently unsustainable? reply stetrain 14 hours agorootparentIf everyone needs to have a car to get around that&#x27;s 3 parking spaces per person. Or 6-12 parking spaces per household.This is nearing the square footage of an apartment to house the same number of people. So for any given unit of housing real estate we need an equivalent or greater amount of parking real estate.When everyone wants to live close together (ie in LA near where they work, socialize, etc. not in middle of Nebraska) that puts a real pressure on space, and drives up the cost for real estate.Even if you want to increase density by building higher buildings, the cost of those condo&#x2F;apartment towers now must factor in a parking garage pedestal taking up 1&#x2F;3 of its height, and so must offices, shopping centers, etc.I don&#x27;t think the ratio of parking spaces per car needs to be reduced. Rather it needs to be recognized, and thus reveal the cost of policies that lead to one car per person. If you can reduce the cars per person ratio, you reduce the number of parking spaces required at a 3x rate. reply michael1999 14 hours agorootparentprev3 parking spaces is ~750sqft. A moving car is another 2000sqft. Once population density passes ~3 stories, the geometry stops working. Once drive time exceeds an hour or two, the math stops working. It&#x27;s the urban rocket equation. reply bombcar 10 hours agorootparentThey’re not additive - a car can’t be parked and moving at the same time. reply michael1999 7 hours agorootparentThis is in response to a thread discussing the fact that LA has three parking spots per car, and they must (by counting) be mostly empty. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentprevIt isn&#x27;t unsustainable. However it is limiting. That is a lot of space that is 2&#x2F;3rds empty yet not really usable for anything else. Worse, cars are heavy and so it isn&#x27;t practical to go vertical with parking spaces (we can&#x2F;do build parking ramps - but they are a lot more expensive and so few want to pay to park there, and even then there seems to be a limit to how tall you can make them)Cities are great because of all the different things you can get to. However cars spread the city out, and in this in turn means you can&#x27;t do as many things. You can still do a lot, but eventually the distance (distances in cities are measured in time not meters!) is unreasonable and so you can&#x27;t get someplace in your city. Dense cities enable more things. If you just want to go to walmart - so do everyone else so no problem. However if you have a niche interest you may discover not enough people live within range to support a place for your interest even though across the entire city there are enough people. reply pandaman 7 hours agorootparent> However if you have a niche interest you may discover not enough people live within range to support a place for your interest even though across the entire city there are enough people.How are the cars limiting here?

Without the car ubiquity you&#x27;d need to get into expensive real estate in the city center to get potential customers and charge them for your rent, which is fine if you are dealing in, say, collectible wines or artisanal Swiss timepieces and no business if you want to sell Gundam models or knitting sullies. reply empyrrhicist 14 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.homeadvisor.com&#x2F;cost&#x2F;outdoor-living&#x2F;pave-a-parki...And that doesn&#x27;t cover opportunity cost or the knock-on effects of market distortion, or the exponentially higher costs of e.g. parking garages. reply kube-system 14 hours agorootparentThe price to pave a lot is by far the least unsustainable part of the situation.

By removing parking minimums, it implies that people will have a harder time driving, which will entice them to use other means to get around. But, the big issue is that cities also need to invest in those other means of getting around. That means making micro-mobility easier with protected infrastructure, more bus service, more light-rail, etc. LA had a light rail service until GM, Standard Oil, and Firestone Tire organized a shell company to buy out the system and eventually tear it out.

I lived near a neighborhood that had older denser development, that originally served just that neighborhood, but later became a hip place for people to go, thus exceeding existing parking. It was very frustrating that residents could never find a place to park because all the parking was taken local businesses patrons, and patrons couldn&#x27;t find parking because that one collage bar was having a busy night and taking all the parking for five blocks around.It didn&#x27;t help that the urbanism activists in our area seem to consider parking garages to be a tool of the devil and protested any plans to build one in the area. To me they are an ideal compromise&#x2F;stop-gap solution. They allow you to build dense walkable neighborhoods today even when most people will be driving. And once public transit has improved to the point where less parking is needed, you just have a few buildings to tear down instead of entire areas to redevelop.Edit: And to be clear I think the \"best practices\" that most of the country used for the past 50 years to set parking minimums were massively inflated, and created many problems.

Although in this case I never heard of a developer wanting to build a parking structure on their own (and don&#x27;t know if existing code would have prevented them). It was always the city wanting to build an adjacent parking structure as part of revitalization efforts to extend the success of that neighborhood further down the street. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentSo part of this is the cart-horse inversion.We have minimum parking requirements that produce an oversupply of parking, therefore parking is cheap, therefore building parking garages is unprofitable. If you don&#x27;t mandate them, the cost of parking will increase until building parking garages is profitable, and then people will build parking garages (or have fewer cars, in places where that&#x27;s practical).This doesn&#x27;t even increase costs. Right now someone is paying $3000&#x2F;month for a $2500 apartment and a $500 parking space. Without the parking requirements you could get a $2500 apartment for $2500 and choose whether you want to pay the extra $500 for the parking space.Not only that, this would make it cheaper to build more apartments, so then the $2500 apartment drops to $2250 from lower scarcity, which reduces the cost of apartment+parking space as well by not force-allocating a parking space to someone who can do without a car and leaving more for the people who can&#x27;t. reply bombcar 9 hours agorootparentprevThe lack of developers building parking garages tells us that the actual value of the parking is not as high as we think it is in most areas - and in fact parking garages are often built more to protect the vehicles than to provide extra parking. reply Modified3019 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the local college planners in our city wanted to “discourage” vehicle use, and deliberately had only a few parking lots put in, mostly reserved for faculty of course.

The housing 3 miles a way is at least half the cost of my town.The public transportation is poor and it took about 25 years to build less than 3 miles of bike path.Should my town ditch off-street parking minimums in an attempt to increase housing supplies? reply busterarm 14 hours agorootparent> Nobody is really space constrained.Clearly the answer is no then.That doesn&#x27;t make space-constrained Austin&#x27;s answer an automatic yes either though. The city is very car-dependent. The starting point isn&#x27;t \"take away peoples&#x27; ability to have a car\". It should be \"make it more attractive not to have a car\".Changing parking minimums comes far down that road. reply detourdog 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not clear to me. I really wish you could take the effort to explain your thinking. If there is no place to park but your neighbor&#x27;s yard how it would work in a civilized society and help housing costs. reply chaostheory 15 hours agorootparentprevThen you’ll end up with the building equivalent of the titanic which had a lot of luxurious amenities and decor, but skimped on the more boring stuff like structural integrity. You can see this in effect in parts of Asia. The closest example we have in the US is the Millennium Tower. There were regulations, (someone could correct me) but they decided to “bribe” their way out of it.Ironically, I still share your opinion about over regulation, but we can’t ignore the other argument. reply vel0city 15 hours agorootparentprevIts expensive to build parking. Loads of shopping centers end up having to build seas of parking spaces due to these parking minimums given their square footage even though the actual car traffic wouldn&#x27;t come close. I imagine a lot of those stores would have preferred paying for far less real estate and paving. reply dave78 15 hours agorootparentPerhaps the problem isn&#x27;t the fact that parking requirements exist but rather that they require way too many parking spots. Most shopping center lots in my area are never close to full, even on the busiest Christmas shopping days. reply detourdog 14 hours agorootparentI here this a lot but in the North East at least those extra spots can be used during the winter for snow management.Snow management can be done in other ways but that is a cost analysis exercise. reply vel0city 13 hours agorootparentCan you elaborate on the snow management aspects? reply dave78 13 hours agorootparentParking lots are a common place to store excess snow when it is plowed. Obviously from the parking lot itself, but also sometimes snow is hauled in dump trucks from other areas where there is no space to store the snow.In snowy areas the piles can grow quite large and take up a sizable amount of parking lot space. These large piles then take considerably longer to melt away than snow in surrounding areas, sometimes lasting well into Spring. reply busterarm 15 hours agorootparentprevShopping Centers are an entire different zone than housing. You typically do not build them in the same places. They&#x27;re built in less desirable places than housing which makes the parking spaces cheaper and an efficient use of the space.Not all square footage is created equal! reply arcticbull 15 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s great. Should increase demand for transit. reply busterarm 15 hours agorootparentEffective public transit isn&#x27;t something you can bolt onto a city after the roads are all built. Cities like Austin that were designed for cars from the outset are hopeless lost causes.Old world cities can have great public transit because they were dense long before cars existed and have hundreds of years worth of civil projects designed to get people from A to B. reply arcticbull 14 hours agorootparent> ... have hundreds of years worth of civil projects designed to get people from A to B.We better get started right away then, huh. reply busterarm 14 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t start by building public transit. You start by bulldozing roads and housing and moving&#x2F;rebuilding communities. reply arcticbull 14 hours agorootparentDo you have a citation for that? Large portions of Paris for instance aren&#x27;t exactly old-world high density development. Luckily they&#x27;re putting in the GPE, which is 120 miles of metro service. [1] Once you have the metro, you can put in higher-density development around the stations, and over time, the neighborhood changes. That&#x27;s just fine.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grand_Paris_Express reply busterarm 14 hours agorootparentMost of Paris as we know it was built in the 1950s and 1960s. Especially in the 1970s French politicians took on ambitious public works projects in Paris.Most of the housing and most of the population was obliterated in the late-1930s through the mid-1940s, as you might recall. Two-thirds of the city&#x27;s population had fled before the German invasion started even. replyBobaFloutist 14 hours agorootparentprevMy apartment charges me to maintain a parking spot in the garage, giving them more money for minimal extra maintenance. This way people that don&#x27;t have cars don&#x27;t have to subsidize my parking spot, but it&#x27;s still super worth it for the landlord.If the cost to provide (guaranteed, protected) parking spots ends up being higher than people are willing to pay for them, maybe they&#x27;re not actually worth what we&#x27;re currently paying for them. reply NoZebra120vClip 15 hours agorootparentprevExcept this sort of code has a very real impact on volume of business, in the case of retail outlets, restaurants, venues or anything that&#x27;s open to the public.Can you see the design conversations going, \"let&#x27;s provide for practically no parking spots, so we can get less foot traffic and nobody will want to come shop here!\"In areas that support public transit and promote multi-modal, the businesses which thrive there are ones which cater to folks who eschew private vehicles. And that&#x27;s a distinctly different crowd! So I think it&#x27;ll work out great. reply saiya-jin 15 hours agorootparentprevHere in Switzerland I&#x27;ve seen the opposite - the amount of parking requested by the developer (true, this was for local bank growth and not condos) was slashed significantly by municipality, as in &#x27;don&#x27;t bring your cars to your work&#x27;, effectively removing 1 underground level of parking and some more, right under the bank.There are very few countries out there that would see such behavior flying, when facing a wealthy developer (it used to be the biggest company in this village&#x2F;small town) who gives a lot of local work, for just parking spots that are anyway completely hidden under the building. reply Throw839 14 hours agorootparentExtra parking would bring in \"poor\" people who live in France, Italy or Germany but commute to work in Switzerland. Just another form of elitism. reply DoneWithAllThat 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not. I’ve lived in neighborhoods that did this and it was a nightmare. All street parking filling up by 4pm. Half hour walks to your car. Neighbors keying each others cars for taking up a space for too long. Guests basically just being SOL - you’d literally be unable to have guests over because if you left to pick them up there’d be no spot when you got back, and if they drove themselves they’d never find a spot.Without readily available and reliable public transportation this is just lining developers pockets (because fewer parking spaces needed means more units they can build). reply ericmay 17 hours agorootparent> Neighbors keying each others cars for taking up a space for too long.People need to stop being shitty to each other.> Without readily available and reliable public transportation this is just lining developers pockets (because fewer parking spaces needed means more units they can build).I don&#x27;t think this is fair. Fewer parking spaces might mean higher profits for developers on a per-unit basis, but I&#x27;d rather them make money and provide more additional housing units that are sorely needed, especially in cities, than build apartment complexes with garages or parking which then necessitate higher taxes and more public spending to support roads, car crashes, and other related externalities.\"But public transit costs money too\" yes, just redirect state highway department budgets to transit 1-1 and then you&#x27;re not spending any more and getting higher ROI. reply arcticbull 15 hours agorootparentFurther, we should move to a model where the highways are paid entirely by usage fees (gas tax, tolls, etc) instead of subsidized. They&#x27;re for the benefit of private operators, so the private operators should pay for them. The investments should be in public transit instead. reply wharvle 15 hours agorootparentA great deal of highway spending is subsidizing truck shipping. Most of the damage done to highways comes from big trucks, and taxes on them don&#x27;t come anywhere near paying for it.[EDIT] Incidentally, maybe we shouldn&#x27;t subsidize truck shipping! But using usage taxes to pay for highways while not shifting the burden such that truck shipping is paying the lion&#x27;s share of the cost and is no longer (so very much, at least) subsidized, would be making non-commercial drivers subsidize truck shipping (even more than they already are) which subsidy (to some degree) benefits everyone, including non-drivers, which seems like a weird and&#x2F;or bad move to me. reply arcticbull 14 hours agorootparentTruck shipping has never made sense to me. It&#x27;s significantly less fuel efficient than rail shipping, and paying people to just sit there and drive for their entire lives feels kinda torturous to me... reply wharvle 14 hours agorootparentLots of communities aren&#x27;t served by rail, ship, or barge (or nowhere near enough capacity of those, or efficiently connected to the wrong places—how much raw iron ore or coal does a small town need?) so truck shipping&#x27;s all they&#x27;ve got. Rail may pass through nearby, but without unloading capability or sufficient capacity at a proper train yard. Trucks drive to them from the nearest hub or notable train yard, which may be way more than your usual \"last mile\" concern that a city or whatever has. Tens of miles, to the warehouses that serve them, then tens of miles more to the nearest major store, that kind of thing.Rural living would be way more expensive and inconvenient without truck shipping subsidies. Which, maybe making rural living artificially cheap is a good idea and maybe it&#x27;s not, but that&#x27;s one big shift that would happen if we made truck shipping pay its way entirely.[EDIT] For true long-haul, I&#x27;m with you, the majority of that&#x27;s surely only viable because of those subsidies, and we&#x27;d be better off pushing that to rail, ship, and barge. replycomte7092 16 hours agorootparentprev> Neighbors keying each others cars for taking up a space for too long.I don’t know how this is the fault of too little parking. Nothing excuses this type of behavior. reply 0xfaded 14 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately people will fight tooth and nail to maintain their existing expectations and will see public transit as a threat to their cars.You have to take away cars (parking) first so that they start demanding public transportation. reply chung8123 13 hours agorootparentThe problem with public transport is it serves too many masters. Is it a system to allow the disabled to get around? Is it a system to enable everyone in town to get around? Is it a commuting system? Should it be subsidized or revenue neutral? Trying to solve all these problems makes the public transport systems not work for any of them well. reply FpUser 14 hours agorootparentprevSo you want to arm twist people to suit your agenda? It does not work this way. Personally I aways support and would vote for more public transport but not by forcing me to abandon my car. If that is the approach the only vote you&#x27;ll get from me is fuck you. And I am a nicer guy who mostly uses EUC, bike and feet. reply LargeWu 13 hours agorootparentNobody is forcing you to abandon your car, you are just going start absorbing the true cost of the externalities (whether in tolls, taxes, inconvenience, etc). You can decide for yourself then whether using or owning a car is worth that. reply FpUser 13 hours agorootparentSure. Foot me a bill since I am affecting other person&#x27;s lives. Just make sure it is correct. Also do not forget to compensate me as I am affected by other people. reply brewdad 14 hours agorootparentprevCarrot vs stick is one of the most basis forms of influence. When the carrot doesn&#x27;t work... reply FpUser 13 hours agorootparentIt works both ways reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparentprev> if they drove themselves they’d never find a spotRideshare. Also, this screams market opportunity for paid parking. (Unless, of course, the problem isn’t as consistently dramatic.) reply tuna74 14 hours agorootparentprevThe easy solution to this is to make (street) parking more expensive. reply chung8123 13 hours agorootparentStreet parking should have a price attached to it in my opinion. It is a public resource that should be charged for use everywhere, including out in front of your suburban home. We push these prices on everyone when it should be the people using them that pay. reply sokoloff 9 hours agorootparentArguably property taxes, being the main way roads are funded in my city, pays for at least part of the access to the parking portion of those roads. reply coldpie 17 hours agorootparentprev> Without readily available and reliable public transportationCool. Let&#x27;s do that, too! reply NoZebra120vClip 15 hours agorootparentprevMy parents live in a residential, SFH neighborhood that&#x27;s basically designated overflow parking for revelers. Especially during Pride Week, motorists will fill every street parking spot, only to stroll into the drunken debauchery, and then stagger back and attempt to locate their vehicles.They&#x27;ve also seen ZipCar type services where short-term rental vehicles are just abandoned. Once, I woke up to find a luxury Alfa Romeo sedan that had taken a joy-ride across the border and was abandoned in front of our place.The main street there dead-ends, and so the highest traffic is from lost motorists vainly attempting to hook up to the freeway.My parents jealously guard their prime parking spots, I mean insanely: they love to walk but if they need to tote cargo more than 1 yard out of the way, we never hear the end of their moaning, and I live hundreds of miles away. They participate in Neighborhood Watch and won&#x27;t hesitate to get cars tagged, inspected and towed if someone tries to mess with their \"public street parking\" spots. (Recently renovated \"garage\" is full of junk.)As a holder of a driver&#x27;s license who hasn&#x27;t owned a car since 1997, I also never hear the end of their moaning about rude cyclists, oblivious pedestrians, City-sponsored transit lanes, or repainted roads to encourage sharing with pedestrians and multi-modal transport.Around here, most of the moaning and screaming is directed at light rail, without considering for a moment how it takes drunks and inept drivers off the road and completely out of their way. reply fzeroracer 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat neighborhoods, exactly? Parking minimums have been the de facto law for cities, it&#x27;s only in the past decade that trend has been starting to be reversed in the US. reply _dain_ 17 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like the parking was underpriced.EDIT I am rate-limited so can&#x27;t reply, but this part:\"If you have 200 cars\"This is only the case if the demand for parking &#x2F; driving is perfectly inelastic, which would be quite extraordinary. Empirically, when you charge for parking or institute toll roads, traffic tends to fall, in some cases sharply (because many journeys are low value). I repeat: if the parking spaces are still congested, the price should be raised until they&#x27;re not.Assuming the number of cars would stay the same is like the lump-of-labour fallacy. Lump of metal fallacy?Then there&#x27;s the supply side: guess what, that&#x27;s not inelastic either! If it&#x27;s profitable to provide parking, someone will build dedicated facilities for it and charge for their use. This may be an alien concept for some of you, but only because parking minimums cause such oversupply that they can&#x27;t be run profitably. In cities where parking is priced sanely, it&#x27;s unremarkable to see this.\"Cars will just overflow into adjacent neighbourhoods\" okay, so charge for parking there too, until they don&#x27;t. Duh.I don&#x27;t see why cars should get to sit somewhere rent-free but a human being can&#x27;t. Urban land is valuable; if you want to occupy it, pay what it costs, ya fuckin welfare queens.my language is harsh but it&#x27;s hard not to be when I see so many americans (it&#x27;s always americans) confidently claiming that life is impossible without free parking. but I live in a city without free parking and things work just fine. I can literally just look out of my window and it disproves all the doomsaying. every commute and trip to the supermarket is uneventful and not ruined in the slightest by a lack of free parking. you pay for parking and it&#x27;s fine. it&#x27;s literally just fine. I went to virginia one time, I saw literal acres and acres and acres of empty parking space, oceans of asphalt; nobody seemed to think anything of it but I thought it was mad, like some kind of braindead economic allocation fuckup from a communist country that we&#x27;d all laugh about. I wanted to shout: you are being terraformed by asphalt-based lifeforms! why do I have to explain to americans how a free market price mechanism works? on a forum for people to shill their california startups? I shouldn&#x27;t need to tell you this! reply foxyv 17 hours agorootparentParking, Roads, Gasoline, Pollution, etc... We so heavily subsidize people&#x27;s cars for no reason. For the cost of all of it we could have free healthcare and amazing public transportation then lower taxes with the left over money. reply njarboe 15 hours agorootparentUm... Just US healthcare spending is 17.3% of GDP. $4.5 Trillion per year. No way this works. reply foxyv 13 hours agorootparentA large part of that is inflated health care costs. US citizens have to pay more than twice as much on average. Some services such as ER visits can cost 10x as much. US spends twice as much per capita than UK but get much less from it. Also keep in mind that the amount spent on roads is only a fraction of the total cost of cars in the USA. reply brewdad 14 hours agorootparentprevCut out the middle man (insurance companies and their profits) and you can get this number dramatically lower. reply BillTheDuck 12 hours agorootparentSimple solutions do NOT exist.There is a litany of \"middlemen\"; Drs, Corporations, Hospitals, Insurance, Pharmacies, Drug Companies, marketing, Lawyers ... ALL have a stake in something. reply autoexec 17 hours agorootparentprevjacking up the prices for parking spaces due to artificially induced scarcity will mean that cars are still every bit as essential to get around, but now only the wealthy will be able to afford to park them, screwing over the population least able to arrange&#x2F;afford alternatives. I guess it&#x27;s somehow better if the increasing number of poors in the US have to park miles away from their jobs (if they&#x27;re lucky enough) and have to walk&#x2F;run the rest of the way.Like it or not, our cities are already built to make cars a necessity and pricing people out of access to the majority of places within a city isn&#x27;t a solution to the design of public transportation or roads. reply ripply 16 hours agorootparentThis is step 1 of reversing car centricity in these areas. Believe it or not some people in Europe in their 30s don’t even know how to drive because it’s just not needed. When you require parking spots for housing you increase the distance between everything. Going places requires transport because you have all these god forsaken parking lots you have to traverse to get to your destination. reply autoexec 16 hours agorootparentStep one should be creating adequate public transportation so that the people with the fewest options are still able to get to work, doctors, and grocery stores even after existing parking spaces go away and no new ones are built.Parking lots aren&#x27;t what&#x27;s keeping people in subdivisions from being miles away from those places. Parking spots aren&#x27;t what&#x27;s keeping people in cities from being able to walk to where they&#x27;re going either. Parking lots are extremely walkable spaces even while being hot and unattractive.You could get rid of every parking lot in your city and you&#x27;d still have highways you can&#x27;t cross or safely walk&#x2F;bike along side of, you&#x27;d still have housing set miles away from city centers, and you&#x27;d still have no access to most places by public transportation. Our cities are built from the ground up with the expectation that people will use cars to get around. That was a mistake, but getting rid of parking spots isn&#x27;t the cure.I&#x27;ve been in places like Tokyo where public transportation met all of my needs. We can do it, but you need the infrastructure in place first or you&#x27;re just hurting people by leaving them with zero alternatives to what you&#x27;re taking from them. reply hughesjj 14 hours agorootparentWhy not replace some on street parking with a dedicated bus lane and stops for such?Two birds, one stone reply autoexec 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;d be a good start!It&#x27;ll take a massive increase in public transportation infrastructure, and a long and slow redesign of our cities and how we live to fix the mess the auto-industry has put us in. It&#x27;s a transition that&#x27;s long overdue, but the reality of the situation now is that people still need their cars.Making sure that people have something to fall back on before we take their cars away from them or remove the places they put them at night&#x2F;charge them should be a priority. What these cities are doing is the opposite of that. reply brewdad 14 hours agorootparentMany households have more than one car per driver. With WFH many of these cars sit largely unused. We went down to being a one car family over a year ago and it has rarely been an issue. It requires a little bit of planning. \"Hey I need the car on Thursday. Does that work for you?\" Otherwise, a second car would mostly only get used because \"Well, it hasn&#x27;t been driven in a while\". reply autoexec 12 hours agorootparentI agree that WFH is a game changer here. Households in that situation are incentivized to get rid of excess vehicles since they cost money to maintain, license, and insure. With downtown office spaces and the nearby businesses that depend on them being abandoned, a lot of parking space can be reclaimed there too. replykilotaras 17 hours agorootparentprev> artificially induced scarcityHow is *not requiring* parking to be provided inducing scarcity artificially? reply autoexec 16 hours agorootparentBecause before developers were required to ensure that when they built something adding parking spaces to handle the demand they were introducing to an area was their responsibility. Now developers can (and will) push that externality onto the public at zero cost to them. The city has a very limited amount of parking spaces it can provide at any cost which means that removing that requirement will suddenly make parking much more expensive and harder to obtain. reply kilotaras 16 hours agorootparentBut that&#x27;s not what artificially inducing means.London for example have buildings which are prohibited of having parking (or getting street permit). Providing an option not pay for parking space when buying an apartment is not that. reply hughesjj 14 hours agorootparentIDK, pure speculation, but maybe &#x27;autoexec&#x27; isn&#x27;t arguing in good faith here and may have a conflict of interest reply autoexec 14 hours agorootparentI really don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not even sure what kind of person would have a conflict of interest while supporting that we keep the requirement until actual alternatives are available to everyone.While I have a car, and enjoy having one, and have a nice parking space in a heated underground garage, I also work remotely and don&#x27;t drive all that much. I&#x27;m in a privileged position and could afford to uber (within the city anyway).This is just a bad&#x2F;non-solution to a very real problem that will do more harm than good. reply brewdad 14 hours agorootparentDo you pay for that spot? Would you keep the car if it was costing you $150&#x2F;mo to park it there? If not, then removing parking minimums accomplishes exactly what it is intended to do. reply autoexec 11 hours agorootparentThe cost of the spot is factored into the cost of the building so it still costs something, but even if it were a separate bill I&#x27;d still be stuck paying for it because I need a car and it has to go somewhere (plus I live in an area where it snows and don&#x27;t want to get up at 5AM to move it every time that happens or scrape the ice off my windows&#x2F;mirrors before I can leave). reply jmye 13 hours agorootparentprevAssuming bad faith is somewhat ironic and kind of a crummy way to interact online. Do you not think it&#x27;s conceivable that someone could possibly think this is a bad idea honestly? reply zdragnar 14 hours agorootparentprevThe externality is already accounted for there. replyclose04 17 hours agorootparentprevRaising the price would just extract more value for the owners from a very limited resource. But the resource stays just as limited.If you have 200 cars and 50 parking spaces there&#x27;s no price point at which the 200 cars can park simultaneously. The overflow ends up clogging the surrounding neighborhoods, on top of the outcome described by OP.Edit. @pc86, both points you make are valid but neither addresses or fixes the problem being discussed. They are an interesting, albeit completely parallel discussion. reply medvezhenok 17 hours agorootparentThis is the approach Singapore (and in some ways, Hong Kong) takes; you can own a car, but you must purchase a 10-year use permit, which costs in some cases much more than a car itself (something like $80,000 over 10 years). So if you&#x27;re buying a Toyota Corolla ($20K car), you&#x27;d still need a $80K operating permit to use it.That&#x27;s why 90%+ of the people in Singapore use public transportation or carpool. Granted, you would need the public infrastructure for that to be possible. But if you make cars unaffordable for the average person, suddenly there would be A LOT more pressure on local government to get public infrastructure done. reply shiroiuma 59 minutes agorootparentHere in Tokyo, you&#x27;re not allowed to buy a car unless you can prove to the police that you have a place to park it (and that it actually fits: they&#x27;ll come measure). reply breezeTrowel 15 hours agorootparentprevSure but public infrastructure doesn&#x27;t magically appear overnight. It takes years, decades even, and costs a ton of money. I think the solutions may come laterally from developments in autonomous construction robots. They&#x27;re being developed in Japan due to negative population growth reducing the available construction workforce. reply pc86 17 hours agorootparentprev> Raising the price would just extract more value for the owners from a very limited resource.Yes. If you own a limited resource it&#x27;s your right to make money from that. I know we like to pretend people making money from things they own is somehow evil but it&#x27;s how all of civilization has been built and is an objectively good thing.> If you have 200 cars and 50 parking spaces there&#x27;s no price point at which the 200 cars can park simultaneously.No, but is a point where 50 can",

Built upon Phi-2, TinyGPT-V couples an effective language backbone with pre-trained vision modules from BLIP-2 or CLIP. TinyGPT-V&#x27;s 2.8B parameters can undergo a unique quantisation process, suitable for local deployment and inference tasks on 8G various devices.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2312.16862 reply infotainment 8 hours agoprevWhile the non-commercial Phi2 license continues to be a letdown, I&#x27;m excited to see additional development in the space of these ultracompact LLMs. On-device AI excites me far more than relying on yet another cloud-based API.On my M1 Macbook Air, current LLMs can run surprisingly quickly locally already. reply rablackburn 5 hours agoparent> On-device AI excites me far more than relying on yet another cloud-based API.Agreed. The huge leap-forward in capability already boggles my mind, the fact that I can run it _on my desktop cpu_ and have an interactive, natural-language oracle of the internet in a mere ~11GB file.Everyone seems to be chasing the network-accessible API approach because lock-in is easy and if you&#x27;re at the bleeding-edge (training) you&#x27;ve got the compute for running it anyway.But now with accessible, local models my bet is on bored young hackers coming up with the best use cases and killer apps, not Microsoft. reply triyambakam 4 hours agorootparentWhich local models and CPU are you using? reply justinl33 11 hours agoprev> You need to execute the above code 17 times to complete the first stage of training.Am I missing something here?

Sadly this project is built on top of phi-2 that has the non-commercial friendly Microsoft research license. reply ashvardanian 3 hours agoparentWe have released an even-smaller model - UForm-Gen a couple of weeks ago. It&#x27;s fully open-source, so it may help, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect results anywhere close to the GPT4V, assuming there is over 1000x difference in model size and consumed resources. reply jn2clark 4 hours agoprevCan anyone comment on an open source multi-modal LLM that can produce structured outputs based on an image? I have not found a good open source one yet (this included), seems to be only closed source that can do this reliably well. Any suggestions are very welcome! reply smpanaro 10 hours agoprevMobileVLM [1] is another recent small multimodal model. They trained their own 1.4B&#x2F;2.7B LLaMa from scratch using RedPajama and Vicuna instead of leveraging Phi-2.The papers only have one common benchmark (GQA, MobileVLM scores better) so hard to say how they compare otherwise.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2312.16886 reply ilaksh 12 hours agoprevTheir results seem comparable to BLIP-2, shifted over in the diagram. reply samstave 11 hours agoprevI really want to understand this post, but I can&#x27;t, may you please direct me, and those noobs like me - to resources to be able to read this? (help anyone to climb the knowledge ladder) ELI3-EDIT - GPT helped me understand better:-->>> \"This model is special because it can do similar tasks as the big models but requires much less computational power1. It’s like having a small but powerful engine that can do the work of a big one. This makes it more accessible for more people to use it\"--->>> \"TinyGPT-V is built on another model called Phi-2 and uses pre-trained vision modules from BLIP-2 or CLIP1. It has 2.8 billion parameters (these are like the model’s brain cells) and can be further compressed to fit on devices with 8GB memory1. This means you could potentially run this model on your personal computer or even some high-end smartphones1\"---->>> \"In summary, TinyGPT-V is a step towards making powerful AI models more accessible and efficient, which could lead to their use in a wide range of real-world applications1. The authors have also shared their code and training weights for others to use and learn from1\"-----This is really interesting if you fan out implications over N time?Here is my thinking:Assume this paper results in a way of \"compression-alyzed vision\" into a model (a tiny compressed view into a model)Then one, in a few years can imagine \"laser views\" - that slice through fractals of models to find the result. Resulting in tiny agents that have a heat-seeking-fractal-laser that can navigate giant data based on a method of knowing instantaneously what to exclude (meaning the path is defined by the walls that you already know you do not want to hit, so your steps are always that which helps you forward)--Or am I stating something obvious to all you brainiacs?(no shame, I like thinking out loud) reply ricopags 10 hours agoparentI am no brainiac, and it isn&#x27;t super clear from your post what you&#x27;re describing, but here is some info that might help you better convey your question:This is a neural net built by conjoining Phi-2 [the best available small LLM, if you&#x27;ll pardon the contradiction in terms] with pre-trained vision models like BLIP or CLIP. Models are piles of weights[&#x2F;parameters] that are generated by training on datasets.Already work has shown that training a multi-model model from the start results in smaller, more effective model.
