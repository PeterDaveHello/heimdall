In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we’ve seen distinct “waves” of change in coffee consumption. Not only have roasting and brewing methods grown more refined, tools and accessories have also become increasingly precise in their engineering. The First Wave marks the emergence of pre-ground, mass-produced coffee (think Folgers), while Second Wave introduces specialty coffee chains and espresso culture (like Starbucks). Third Wave delves into coffee as an artisanal craft, emphasizing bean origin and brewing methods (Blue Bottle, etc.). The emergent Fourth Wave pushes boundaries with scientific precision and sustainable practices, refining coffee’s production and enjoyment. Our Neptune industrial CT scanner is the perfect companion for tracing this evolution, revealing how and why coffee tools and techniques stand the test of time. SHARE THIS Moka Express BIALETTI, 1933 Until the 20th century, coffee was primarily enjoyed in coffee shops. That all changed when Alfonso Bialetti invented the Moka Express in 1933, inspired by a washing machine his wife used to do laundry. But the Moka didn’t really catch on until after WWII, when Alfonso’s son Renato refined the octagonal Art Deco design to maximize heat capture in the base and replace the flammable wooden handle with a modern Bakelite one. More importantly, Renato was a marketing genius who innovated advertising techniques in the 1950s to include billboards, commercials, and even animations — introducing “l’omino coi baffi” (the little man with a mustache), based on Renato himself. The little man appeared on the side of the Moka pot and also starred in cartoons showing how quick and easy it was to make coffee with the Moka Express: all you need is water, coffee, and fire to brew espresso-style (it’s not quite espresso) coffee in the comfort of your own home. Since then, an estimated 300 million Moka pots have been sold, and today you can find them in 90% of Italian homes. The Moka Express consists of three primary cast aluminum parts: a bottom chamber for water, a middle funnel-shaped filter basket for coffee grounds, and a top chamber to collect the brewed coffee. To brew, fill the bottom chamber with water up to just below the safety release valve in the wall. Then add medium-fine ground coffee (slightly coarser than you’d use for espresso) to the filter basket, but don’t tamp it down. Screw the top chamber back on and place on a stovetop at medium heat. Be careful to avoid an open flame going beyond the edges of the base, otherwise you’ll end up with a stalactite of melted plastic at the end of your handle — as you can see in this well-loved Moka pot that we scanned. As the water heats up, it creates steam. The steam pressure forces the hot water up through the coffee grounds in the filter basket and into the top chamber. Take it off the heat before the volcanic sputtering phase at the end; this only adds bitterness to your coffee. The aluminum components prove to be pretty hearty, and if you don’t use abrasive cleaners, the Moka pot develops a coffee patina that some believe enhances the flavor. The gasket around the filter basket wears out over time and will eventually need to be replaced. Here you see how the rubber has dried and cracked, making a secure seal impossible. Steam and water would escape, resulting in an incomplete extraction. Renato Bialetti died in 2016 at the age of 93, and his ashes were interred in a giant Moka pot. Not long after, Bialetti declared bankruptcy but managed to stay afloat after consolidating their business and securing loans. They moved some of their manufacturing outside of Italy, and our CT scans make us wonder if the new Moka Express that we bought on Amazon is a counterfeit or if the quality of the product has fallen off in recent years. Let’s take a look. We didn’t need a CT scanner to observe grease around the threading and unwanted aluminum shavings in the lower chamber, but cropping into the center column, we see an uneven surface finish with aluminum debris that hopefully wouldn’t find its way into our coffee. The quality of the casting in this piece is also inferior. Cropping into the walls, we find the new Moka pot riddled with porosity. These tiny voids in the aluminum may not represent a problem for the performance of the brewer, but they suggest that changes to the casting process or the use of new suppliers may have had unintended consequences. The old Moka pot had visible flash inside the lower chamber from where the pieces of the mold came together, but there’s none to be seen in the new one. Even if Bialetti isn’t what it once was, the Moka pot is here to stay as a beloved brewing technique and icon of industrial design. EXPLORE THE SCANS AeroPress AEROBIE, 2005 The AeroPress was invented by Alan Adler, a retired engineering professor and coffee enthusiast, and introduced to the world in 2005. Unlike traditional brewing methods, the AeroPress utilizes a unique combination of air pressure and immersion brewing, delivering a smooth, rich cup of coffee in under a minute. Its ease of use and portability made it an instant hit among coffee lovers and travelers alike. Over the years, the AeroPress has garnered a devoted following, inspiring coffee championships and daring experiments with brewing techniques. The AeroPress consists of two main parts: a cylindrical chamber and a plunger with a rubber seal. To brew coffee with the AeroPress, you place a paper or metal filter inside the bottom of the plastic mesh filter chamber (on the top in the visualization at left). You then add coffee grounds on top of the filter and pour hot water into the chamber. Give the coffee and water mixture a stir to ensure even extraction. Once the coffee has steeped for the desired amount of time, insert the plunger into the top of the chamber. Gently pressing down on the plunger creates air pressure that forces the brewed coffee through the filter and into the cup below. You can adjust the plunger’s pressure to create different coffee strengths and flavors, allowing full customization. The silicone seal gasket wears down over time, but not as much as you would expect from this seven-year-old AeroPress. Cropping into it from the side, there’s a 0.5 mm gap that we can measure in our Voyager analysis software. Removing used coffee immediately after brewing and storing the AeroPress with the seal pushed all the way through the chamber (as shown) can help minimize wear by reducing compression to extend the gasket’s life. Now let’s compare our old AeroPress to a brand new one. The densities of the old AeroPress chamber and plunger were very similar, both appearing light green in our color map. The chamber of the new AeroPress, however, is made of lower density plastic, which shows up as darker in our color map. Perhaps this change in material will lead to reduced wear over time for the plunger. Though the original AeroPress was made of clear polycarbonate, the company switched to using BPA-free copolyester in 2009 and then in 2014 they changed to (also BPA-free) polypropylene — a durable but lightweight thermoplastic. The density shift evident in our comparison scans is the difference between the copolyester and polypropylene models. If you’re an AeroPress user, dealing with leaks or drips during brewing can be frustrating and messy. Loose or improperly sealed filters and caps are common culprits that can allow water to escape. Another cause is using water that’s too hot, which can lead to plastic expansion and gaps. To avoid leaks, ensure the filter is securely placed and the cap is tightly screwed for a proper seal. Using a slightly coarser grind size can alleviate pressure and reduce leaks. Optimal water temperature (175°F to 185°F) minimizes plastic expansion and potential gaps, helping to ensure a leak-free cup of coffee. EXPLORE THE SCANS Gooseneck kettle FELLOW, 2022 The gooseneck kettle gained recent prominence with the rediscovery of mid-century pour-over brewing methods, such as the V60 and Chemex, which require precise control over water flow and distribution. The long, slender spout of a gooseneck kettle allows you to pour water in a slow, controlled, and circular motion. An even saturation of the coffee grounds promotes consistent extraction and ultimately a well-balanced and flavorful cup of coffee. The gooseneck design also helps prevent splashing, ensuring a mess-free and enjoyable brewing experience. Fellow is at the top of the gooseneck game with their Stagg EKG electric kettle line. Let’s see how they manage to achieve unmatched precision in temperature control with our CT scans of both the kettle body and base. With a sleek minimalist design, the Fellow Stagg kettle combines both form and function. Its precision-pour spout has a stainless steel fluted tip that provides optimal control of water flow. Cropping into the counterbalanced handle, we discover the dense embedded weight that shifts the center of mass closer to your hand and makes it easy to maintain a steady stream of water while pouring. Notice the recessed edge around the circumference of the kettle body base. This increases the surface area exposed to the heating element and speeds up the formation of the convection current to evenly distribute heat throughout the kettle. With the powerful 1200 W heating element (the thin coil wire), the kettle reaches optimal temperature very quickly — in under three minutes. Hidden in the base, we also see a thermal cutoff switch, a mandated safety device that helps prevent fires by interrupting electrical current when the temperature exceeds a certain limit. If you peek into most kettles, you’ll also see a temperature sensor poking its head up. This “boil-dry protection” automatically shuts off when it detects that the water has evaporated or the kettle has been left empty for too long. In the center we see the copper rings that link up with the base coupler. But the base is where the magic really happens. In the lower left corner is a small LCD temperature display screen. On the lower right is the main button and dial. There are two toggle switches on the back. On the left, you can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius (F/C), and on the right, you can set the kettle to hold a temperature for up to an hour. There’s also a hidden game in the Stagg EKG and Corvo EKG kettles. If you remove your kettle from the base and toggle the F/C switch back and forth, you’ll unlock a snake-like game called Wormy that you can play using the dial. Decreasing the opacity of the lower-density snap-fit plastic exterior, we have an excellent view into the kettle base’s internal circuitry. There’s a cable strain relief entrance at the top that keeps the power cord safely connected to the device. The larger wires we see here deliver 120 V household current to the heating element. The smaller wires power the digital electronics (screen and dial). The Fellow EKG Stagg kettle features a sophisticated PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller that uses a solenoid relay switch and MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor). Instead of kicking on and overshooting the target once the temperature has fallen well below it, the PID controller’s non-mechanical approach ensures uniform heating and precise temperature control with minimal fluctuations (±0.3° C). The solenoid relay and MOSFET work in series; the MOSFET flutters to modulate power supply to the heating element inside the kettle. Departing from basic on/off mechanical relays — the annoying click sound that other kettles make — Fellow’s advanced system employs Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for gradual power adjustments. EXPLORE THE SCANS Burr grinder PORLEX, 2018 The scientific precision characteristic of the Third and Fourth Wave of coffee culture places a premium on grind quality. Blade grinders, like in a blender, chop coffee beans with their sharp edges and get the job done quickly, but they produce grounds that are uneven in size and shape. Burr grinders offer a more consistent and precise grind size compared to blade grinders. They use two serrated components, known as burrs, to crush the coffee beans to a uniform size, resulting in a more even extraction during brewing. Burr grinders also generate less heat than blades during the grinding process, minimizing the risk of overheating the coffee grounds and preserving the delicate flavors and aromas. This handheld burr grinder made in Japan by Porlex is perfect for on-the-go brewing, making it a great companion for an AeroPress. The stainless steel body holds 40 grams of coffee in the hopper. Instead of twisting the body like a pepper grinder, you crank the handle like an old-fashioned coffee mill to turn the internal conical burr, while the external ring burr remains stationary. Ground coffee collects in the bottom chamber, and you disassemble to retrieve it. You can see we missed a few grounds on our last cup of coffee; there are remnants in the bottom right of the chamber. Conical burrs allow for a wider surface area, which leads to a slower and more controlled grinding process. Compared to flat burrs, conical burrs also create a more uniform particle size distribution, reducing the potential for clogs and jams. Porlex grinders use high-quality precision-milled ceramic materials. Ceramic remains sharper for longer than steel, does not rust, and imparts no metallic flavor to the coffee. Ceramic burrs have high thermal capacity and don’t warm the coffee during grinding. All of the advantages a burr grinder has over a blade grinder are taken to their highest level with ceramic burrs. Burr grinders also have the advantage of unmatched precision in their ability to adjust grind size to suit different brewing methods. We compared our six-year-old Porlex grinder to a new one, and discovered a redesigned ring burr with additional teeth. Instead of the original six, there are now 15 steps of adjustment. Each click on the adjustment ring under the burrs changes an average of 37 microns, allowing you to dial your exact specifications for everything from cold brew to espresso. We also compared the tiny lower teeth and found no detectable wear and only a slight misalignment between the burrs on the used grinder. Despite the somewhat labor-intensive nature of this analogue tool, the quality of its materials and construction allow it to outperform newer technologies. EXPLORE THE SCANS At times, Fourth Wave innovations verge into the realm of obsession, making you wonder how much real difference all of this precision makes to a cup of coffee. At the end (or beginning) of the day, coffee is a ritual. More than mere caffeine delivery, these technologies enable a multi-faceted sensory experience. Exploring the complexity of its flavors and aromas has transformed coffee from an article of consumption into an open-ended object of scientific and aesthetic experimentation.

My mother has an old (>10 years) Moka that feels heavy and sturdy. A couple of years ago, after accidentally leaving it on the stove for too long, the bottom chamber and the filter basket got a permanent burnt coffee taste, and we bought a new one to replace it. That one was lighter and came with a significant thinner filter basket, which I also attributed to either being counterfeit or just they shipping cheaper versions of the product to Brazil.Then, a couple of months ago, I was on vacation in Italy and decided to get a brand new one as a gift, directly from an official Bialetti store. To my surprise, the Mokas in the store felt exactly like the lower-quality one we had bought in Brazil. I didn&#x27;t even buy the gift. reply rfrey 7 hours agoparentJames Hoffman gives a good history of Bialetti here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=upgQsA5kLAk including their sale to Faema and later to a cookware manufacturer, their numerous brushes with bankruptcy, and the stiff competition they&#x27;ve gotten from... even in Italy... pod machines. reply MarkMarine 11 hours agoparentprevYou see a similar thing with the glass chemex. There is a healthy market on eBay for pre-1980 models that were hand blown from great quality glass. My wife got me one for a gift and the difference in feel is remarkable. New ones feel fragile, this feels solid and strong. I’ve broken two of the newer versions and it’s dangerous. The old one is still standing strong in my house, surviving trips in my RV, and generally doing it’s job. I’m sure I sound like a curmudgeon but they don’t make stuff like they used to reply anamexis 11 hours agorootparentThey still make high quality ones, you just have to specifically get the \"handblown series\" (at 2-3x the price of the regular).e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chemexcoffeemaker.com&#x2F;eight-cup-handblown-series... reply MarkMarine 6 hours agorootparentI am aware of those, but from what I understand the pre-80s ones are still better.

IMHO a contributing factor is that they&#x27;re a company historically centered around manufacturing nearly indestructible appliances (even the newer mokas, however flimsier, don&#x27;t break easily); once the market was saturated with the flagship product, there&#x27;s only so much profit they could squeeze out of selling accessories and the like. reply q7xvh97o2pDhNrh 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if this is the ideal takeaway. Otherwise, we should all prioritize making our products flimsier and more expensive.I think it&#x27;s just a straightforward failure of creativity — or, even more plainly, a failure to understand their customer. They had a great product, which led to a loyal following — why not expand into adjacent markets?The cruel irony is that their product was related to something that&#x27;s extremely disposable. Why not get into the business of coffee beans? Why not partner with interesting coffee growers? Subscription businesses have been huge for decades, now — why not offer consumers the ability to buy an espresso bean subscription to go with their Mokapot, thereby generating a reliable recurring revenue stream?A glimpse at their Wikipedia page [1] suggests they never even tried to branch out from the small, comfortable niche of cookware.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bialetti reply xcdzvyn 5 hours agorootparent> Otherwise, we should all prioritize making our products flimsier and more expensive.It&#x27;s the view of many that this is indeed what most companies prioritize — I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s true, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly fringe opinion. It&#x27;s in the vein of enshittification.Also, might I ask how you inserted that em-dash? A keyboard shortcut? It&#x27;s interesting to see fancy typography online. reply nor-and-or-not 5 hours agorootparentIn macOS you can also use:option+minus for en-dash – and shift+option+minus for em-dash — reply vladvasiliu 3 hours agorootparentThis can be reproduced on Linux using the \"mac\" layout. \"option\" is \"level 3 shift\" on Linux.This works on X11, I haven&#x27;t tried on Wayland.On Windows it works, too, by grabbing the \"us - mac\" layout and using the alt-gr for the mac&#x27;s option.

On macOS at least, there is a keyboard shortcut for \"emojis\" (Cntl+Cmd+Space) and a little window shows up where you can search for emojis by name, and typographical characters by name (such as \"em dash\"). —pjh reply xcdzvyn 5 hours agorootparent> One can look up the utf8 character for different typographical characters and copy and paste them in.Haha, yeah, that&#x27;s what I usually do. But it&#x27;s arduous enough for me not to bother for a HN comment.

The one in my town often has quite a few people in. reply Cthulhu_ 1 hour agorootparentprevBut even if the market is saturated... is it really? I&#x27;m just an armchair expert in this case, but as far as I&#x27;m aware, there&#x27;s not a coffee maker yet in every house; they will eventually break if overheated for example (I broke mine&#x27;s rubber seal by putting it on the stove without water); and there&#x27;s plenty of untapped markets out there yet.That said, one person may buy one coffee maker and never need another one for the next decade or two, or pass it on to their children if it&#x27;s really good. So what another comment said, them expanding into selling coffee as well for example, sounds like an idea. reply rob74 1 hour agorootparentIf the rubber seal is damaged, you can simply replace it, you don&#x27;t need to buy a new coffee maker. When people mention that newer coffee makers are cheaper and lower-quality, that&#x27;s probably Bialetti trying to reach a larger market. I guess lots of people bought one and rarely if ever used it (I think even I have one somewhere, but don&#x27;t ask me where).As for expanding into selling coffee: that&#x27;s natural for systems like Senseo or Nespresso, where you have custom pads&#x2F;pods which you insert into the machine (not sure if third-party pad&#x2F;pod makers have to pay a license fee to the \"system provider\"?), but Bialetti coffee makers work with any ground coffee. Might be an idea nevertheless, but not sure about the odds of success - I imagine most Italians already have their favorite brand of coffee and wouldn&#x27;t suddenly switch to \"Bialetti Coffee\" just because they say it works best with their machines. reply whatshisface 10 hours agorootparentprevThat hypothesis implies that they would wipe out the whole industry long before themselves, so it&#x27;s probably not correct. reply C-x_C-f 10 hours agorootparentNot really, it remains true even when you take competition into account. Also, the rest of the industry isn&#x27;t really playing the same game: all other companies producing moka pots are vastly more diversified. You have e.g. Alessi which fills the design-oriented niche (and has tons of other products), or the countless crummy knock-off factories which churn out all sorts of trash and just happen to machine moka pots once in a while. But only Bialetti kept all its eggs in one basket (at least until it was too late). reply ImprovedSilence 8 hours agorootparenttheir quality went way downhill and they shipped production overseas. I would love to have a nice bialetti moka express or a stainless version. i bought one probs 8 or 9 yrs ago, and it wasn&#x27;t long before the tin lining separated, and the overall quality was crap. nothing like my mothers or any others I had used when i was introduced to them in italy. so i bought an alessi stainless steel made in italy pot at like 5x the price, and never looked back. but do i think a well built bialetti would be as good or better, they just dont make them well anymore… reply nerdponx 9 hours agorootparentprevI see a lot of Bialetti-branded cookware at local supermarkets. Things like nonstick frying pans. I actually bought one on a trip once when I needed a pan, and it&#x27;s pretty good. reply johnnyApplePRNG 11 hours agorootparentprevThey started making garbage quality products and their brand recognition plummeted?

The module contained a bunch of resistors, transistors, capacitors, and diodes, encased in a 13-pin plastic package.

With the Lumafield scans, I could reverse-engineer the circuitry.My writeup: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.righto.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;lumafield-flip-flop.html reply minikomi 10 hours agorootparentWhat an amazing project and thanks for sharing so much about the process! reply amatecha 13 hours agoparentprevThere are scans of other, more-complex objects on the site, such as the Nintendo Game Boy series: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scanofthemonth.com&#x2F;scans&#x2F;game-boy-compendium reply jbrnh 28 minutes agoparentprevYea, can we get one of a CT scanner? reply joezydeco 13 hours agoparentprevI actually enjoyed this one more, since it was used to point out measured tolerances and problems with manufacturing (voids, bubbles, untrimmed flash, shavings, etc). reply lostlogin 14 hours agoparentprevE-61!

Appliances that use the full 3500W are rare but they exist, so it is not like it is illegal. So why don&#x27;t Europeans get the 3000W kettles too?Maybe some people have 10A circuits, maybe this is a margin so that other appliances can be plugged in the same circuit, or maybe it is just more expensive.I have noticed that most 3000W+ appliances I can buy in France are more \"professional\", like what you can find in commercial kitchens or in workshops, but again, it does not mean they are not sold to consumers. reply mschuster91 10 hours agorootparent> European plug sockets are typically rated for 16A, secured with a matching breaker and allowing for about 3500W of power.

So why don&#x27;t Europeans get the 3000W kettles too?The British plug (and ring wiring scheme) was designed for two 13A electric heaters on a single ring, so continuous load.Meanwhile, German Schuko and the related French E plug are theoretically capable of 16A peak load, modern sockets are capable of 16A continuous load as well, but a lot of old installations and especially old sockets are rated for 10A only - so typical kettles are limited to 2200W&#x2F;9.6A to leave a bit of headroom for older, more trigger-happy circuit breakers and other devices on the same circuit. reply lb1lf 2 hours agorootparentI think - I am an electrical engineer working in the offshore industry, so I have only superficial knowledge of shore-based installations - anyway, I seem to recall that the Norwegian electrical code calls for Schuko not being used to carry more than 10A continously, 16A intermittent.However, until relatively recently, the average residential circuit was 10A, though you could get 16A if you asked for it - typically for tumble driers, washing machines and the like - so the market for appliances requiring more than 10A was quite slim.I am sure the appliance stores didn&#x27;t want to have to explain to each and every customer that the beefy kettle they had just put on the counter might not work at their house - hence, 10A appliances for all.(Incidentally, I have a 3kW kettle I bought in the UK and a couple of 16A outlets on my kitchen counter.) reply jcul 10 hours agorootparentprevI remember discussing this during a lecture as part of my electronic engineering degree, speaking about planning for demand during half time of big football matches when everyone went and boiled the kettle at the same time. reply crazygringo 12 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not sure what the point is you&#x27;re trying to make?I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware that US sockets are 110-120V. The power required by a European kettle would too often trip someone&#x27;s circuit breaker in the US, especially if any other equipment were also plugged in (you usually want to stick to max 1500 W on a circuit).Clearly the \"powerful 1200 W\" is in the context of equipment designed for American residential sockets -- the page is produced by an American company after all.(Which is why Americans don&#x27;t use electric kettles nearly as much as Brits&#x2F;Europeans, of course.) reply beojan 11 hours agorootparentA heating element is basically just a resistor, right? Which means if you run one on half the design voltage it&#x27;ll draw half the current it&#x27;s meant to and produce ¼ the power. reply dgfitz 11 hours agorootparentHalf the voltage = 2x the amperage draw, not half, if I’m not mistaken. reply beojan 8 hours agorootparentP = (v^2)&#x2F;R.

But when I started experimenting with an Aeropress and some better coffee I found it interesting that there were many fundamental aspects I could easily taste. Temperature and grind settings can get very obvious quickly. And also the difference between roast levels or some kinds of coffee beans&#x2F;preparation are not difficult to taste. And I don&#x27;t trust myself to distinguish any of the more subtle tastes coffee enthusiasts talk about.But once you e.g get into arguments on whether high-end grinders with conical or flat burrs are better you&#x27;re far into the diminishing returns that might not survive a blind test. reply notamy 12 hours agoparentprevI love that way of thinking about it.

I immaculately saw that the stainless version was considerably easier to clean. Cleaning, afterall, is half the job of using one of these.Visually, I prefer the aluminium shape of course, but they are a real nightmare to keep clean and presumably you&#x27;re drinking a lot of that aluminium oxide. reply riobard 1 hour agoprevA few days ago I accidentally put wife&#x27;s beloved Bialetti Brikka pot in the dishwasher.

Also other protip (which may actually be in the instructions), I pour the hot water onto the gasket before pushing it into the AeroPress, so the material expands and will have a tighter seal. reply angst_ridden 13 hours agoparentprevProper storage is just pulling the plunger out entirely.Every few years, soaking the rubber seal in mineral oil overnight then cleaning will restore flexibility (otherwise it shrinks over time, reducing the quality of the seal).Unrelated: using paper filters is less eco-responsible than the gold foil filter, but makes for better coffee. reply SamBam 6 hours agorootparentA year&#x27;s supply of paper aeropress filters weighs about 1.4 oz. This is significantly less paper than a single Monday New York Times, so if you&#x27;ve ever read a paper newspaper, you&#x27;ve eco-sinned more than drinking a year of aeropress.Indeed, the paper is so little that I&#x27;d be really surprised if the ecological impact of mining and making that metal filter will ever be recouped.It&#x27;s a little how cotton groceries bags are so resource-intensive that you&#x27;d need to use them hundreds and hundreds of times before they&#x27;re better than daily plastic bags. (Litter aside, which isn&#x27;t an issue with paper filters.) reply arp242 10 hours agorootparentprev> Unrelated: using paper filters is less eco-responsible than the gold foil filter, but makes for better coffee.You can use the paper filters more than once too; typically I need about one or two a week (depending on which coffee and how lucky I am), meaning that one €4 350-pack filters will last for years (I just bought my first refill after 4 years, but I didn&#x27;t re-use the filters for the first few months and I gave a bunch of them to a friend when he ran out).Re-use isn&#x27;t necessarily more eco-friendly by the way, because cleaning takes energy too and cost of production can be much much higher. But realistically, the eco-impact and differences are so small it&#x27;s not really something to worry about. reply semi-extrinsic 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never maintained or replaced the seal on mine in over ten years, and it still seals just fine. It&#x27;s made from silicone rubber, which is extreme durability even when continuously exposed to temperatures above boiling or strong acids&#x2F;bases. As used in the AeroPress where it&#x27;s just sitting at room temperature indoors for 99% of the time, durability is at least 20 years.I also use a metal filter, but just for the taste and convenience of not having to buy paper filters.The eco-responsibility argument against filters I don&#x27;t get. Unless you drink extreme amounts of coffee, you use significantly more paper in a day just going to the bathroom. I hope people aren&#x27;t using metal foil for that as well.reply pavon 12 hours agorootparentMy first one had to replaced after about 6 or 7 years. The plunger rubber had gotten worn down, and the internal wall of the brewing compartment had become blistered from hot water (I used 170-185F water). The new one with different materials seems to be holding up better. reply bowmessage 13 hours agorootparentprevWhy is pulling the plunger out entirely necessary for proper storage? I always just push mine all the way through so the rubber isn&#x27;t under any tension.Disagreed on the paper filters, I personally enjoy using a metal filter to ensure the oils from the coffee beans are not filtered out. I suppose it is all subjective. reply angst_ridden 13 hours agorootparentThat works too. I call it \"proper\" because it removes one step before I have coffee, which, no matter how trivial, is a big deal for me in the morning.Interesting about the filter. I prefer super dark roast, Italian espresso-grind coffees. The paper filters give me a much smoother brew. Of course, as you say, taste is entirely subjective! I&#x27;m envious, because I&#x27;d rather have just one reusable filter rather than go through a stack of paper discs each year. reply joezydeco 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen the plunger is at the end of travel and out of tension, the cap won&#x27;t fit on.I just tried screwing on my cap and it forces the plunger back into the shaft, compressing it. reply pavon 12 hours agorootparentYeah, so you just set it down cap up, not screwed in.

It allows you to steep and release, kinda similar to AeroPress (pressure only comes from gravity though).Cone is made of glass, stopper is from stainless steel, but the base is made of silicone. I imagine the hot water contact with the silicone will be a lot less compared to AeroPress.If you get the size 03, you can more easily brew enough coffee for 2 people. reply budgi4 3 hours agoparentprevHeating plastics can release not just BPA but also phthalates, dioxins, and other harmful compounds which are linked to lots of nasty heath issues like hormone disruption, cancer and reproductive problems.Polypropylene is generally considered one of the safer plastics with it&#x27;s high heat tolerance meaning doesn&#x27;t leach harmful chemicals. While pure polypropylene may be considered safe, additives used in the manufacturing such as colourants or fillers could have their own health risks.Personally avoid mixing food or drinks with any heated plastics, including my coffee.

    "originLink": "https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/07/14/when-your-coworker-does-great-work-tell-their-manager/",
    "originBody": "Julia Evans ABOUT TALKS PROJECTS TWITTER MASTODON GITHUB FAVORITES ZINES RSS When your coworker does great work, tell their manager I’ve been thinking recently about anti-racism and what it looks like to support colleagues from underrepresented groups at work. The other day someone in a Slack group made an offhand comment that they’d sent a message to an engineer’s manager to say that the engineer was doing exceptional work. I think telling someone’s manager they’re doing great work is a pretty common practice and it can be really helpful, but it’s easy to forget to do and I wish someone had suggested it to me earlier. So let’s talk about it! I tweeted about this to ask how people approach it and as usual I got a ton of great replies that I’m going to summarize here. We’re going to talk about what to say, when to do this, and why you should ask first. ask if it’s ok first One thing that at least 6 different people brought up was the importance of asking first. It might not be obvious why this is important at first — you’re saying something positive! What’s the problem? So here are some potential reasons saying something positive to someone’s manager could backfire: Giving someone a compliment that’s not in line with their current goals. For example, if your coworker is trying to focus on becoming a technical expert in their domain and you’re impressed with their project management skills, they might not want their project management highlighted (or vice versa!). Giving someone the wrong “level” of compliment. For example, if they’re a very senior engineer and you say something like “PERSON did SIMPLE_ROUTINE_TASK really well!” — that doesn’t reflect well on them and feels condescending. This can happen if you don’t know the person’s position or don’t understand the expectations for their role. If your coworker was supposed to be focusing on a specific project, and you’re complimenting them for helping with something totally unrelated, their manager might think that they’re not focusing on their “real” work. One person mentioned that they got reprimanded by their manager for getting a spot peer bonus for helping someone on another team. Some people have terrible managers (for example, maybe the manager will feel threatened by your coworker excelling) Some people just don’t like being called out in that way, and are happy with the level of recognition they’re getting! Overall: a lot of people (for very good reasons!) want to have control over the kind of feedback their manager hears about them. So just ask first! (“hey, I was really impressed with your work on X project and wanted to send this note to $MANAGER to explain how important your work because I know she wasn’t that involved in X project and might not have seen everything you did, is that ok with you?”) when it’s important: to highlight work that isn’t being recognized Okay, now let’s talk about when this is important to do. I think this is pretty simple – managers don’t always see the work their reports are doing, and if someone is doing really amazing work that their manager isn’t seeing, they won’t get promoted as quickly. So it’s helpful to tell managers about work that they may not be seeing. Here are some examples of types of important work that might be underrecognized: work by someone from another department (maybe their manager doesn’t understand how helpful their contribution was to the company because they don’t work with your team that much, but your coworker’s work made a huge difference!) work that happened in a private channel (for example if someone spent hours helping you with something 1:1 and it really made a big difference to the success of your project) work preventing problems, which often isn’t as visible as firefighting work work by people from underestimated groups (maybe your coworker’s work isn’t being recognized as much as it should be because of racism/sexism/etc!) documentation/code review/other kinds of work that aren’t always as visible as programming work by remotes (if remote work is less visible at your company) work by someone in a role that’s typically underrecognized (someone mentioned support as an example) Also, everyone agreed that it’s always great to highlight the contributions of more junior coworkers when they’re doing well. why it matters: it helps managers make a case for promotion For someone to get promoted, they need evidence that they’ve been doing valuable work, and managers don’t always have the time to put together all that evidence. So it’s important to be proactive! You can work on this for yourself by writing a brag document, but having statements from coworkers explaining how great your work really helps build credibility. So providing these statements for your coworkers can help them get recognized in a timely way for the great work they did (instead of getting promoted a year later or something). It’s extra helpful to do this if you know the person is up for promotion. how to do it: be specific, explain the impact of their work Pretty much everyone agreed that it’s helpful to explain what specifically the person did that was awesome (“X did an incredible job of designing this system and we haven’t had any major operational issues with it in the 6 months since it launched, which is really unusual for a project of that scale”). how to do it: highlight when they’re exceeding expectations Because the point is to help people get promoted, it’s important to highlight when people are exceeding expectations for their level, for example if they’re not a senior engineer yet but they’re doing the kind of work you’d expect from a senior engineer. how to do it: send the person the message too We already basically covered this in “ask the person first”, but especially if I’m using a feedback system where the person might not get the feedback immediately I like to send it to them directly as well. It’s nice for them to hear and they can also use it later on! public recognition can be great too! A couple of folks mentioned that they like to give public recognition, like mentioning how great a job someone did in a Slack channel or team meeting. Two reasons public recognition can be good: It helps build credibility for your colleague It lets the person you’re recognizing be part of the conversation/reciprocate to the feedback-giver, especially if the work was a collaboration. Again, it’s good to ask about this before doing this – some people dislike public recognition. on peer bonuses A few people who work at Google (or other companies with peer bonuses) mentioned that they prefer to give peer bonuses for this because it’s a more official form of recognition. Lots of people mentioned other forms of feedback systems that they use instead of email. Use whatever form of recognition is appropriate at your company! anyone can do this What I like about this is it’s a way everyone can help their coworkers – even if you’re really new and don’t feel that qualified to comment on how effective someone more senior is at their job, you can still point out things like “this person helped me do a project that was really out of my comfort zone!” maybe expand the set of people you do this for! I think it’s very common for people to promote the work of their friends in this way. I’ve tried to expand the set of people I do this for over time – I think it’s important to keep an eye out for coworkers who are really excelling and to make sure their work is recognized. more reading on sponsorship I wanted to just talk about this one specific practice of telling someone’s manager they’re doing great work but there are a LOT of other ways you can help lift your coworkers up. Lara Hogan’s post what does sponsorship look like? has a lot of great examples. Mekka Okereke has a wonderful Twitter thread about another way you can support underrepresented folks: by being a “difficulty anchor”. It’s short and definitely worth a read. thanks to Sher Minn Chong, Allie Jones, and Kamal Marhubi for reading a draft of this Want a weekly digest of this blog?

Not everyone likes getting praise in public settings or they might not want their micromanaging manager to know they helped you outside the scope of their work. You should be cognizant of when praise should be given (i.e. when is it appropriate) and in what context as mentioned in the article.That said, if you aren’t thanking and praising your colleagues for doing good work - YTA of the team. If you are calling out your colleagues for doing bad work, or not the way you would do it work, you should try to rephrase into praise w&#x2F; direction. “I really liked how you tackled this, have you thought about this approach?” Instead of “Why didn’t you do it this way?”*edit* There’s a whole bunch of interesting information on why behavioral praise is better than outcome praise.

Having worked with so many engineers with almost no social skills, I think there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement in their communication style. \"Why didn&#x27;t you do it this way?\" is aggressive and critical. \"have you thought about this approach?\" makes them feel like you have their back and are trying to help. I agree there&#x27;s not a huge need to the \"I really liked how you tackled this\" part but even never praising your coworkers is a an issue. reply tharkun__ 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s different though. I don&#x27;t think your parent meant the \"have you tried this approach\" part but the very very fake and passive aggressive praise that then is turned into \"actually I don&#x27;t think you did great, please try this other approach\". That&#x27;s so fake and irritating. reply eweise 14 hours agorootparentYeah I agree that comes across as fake, especially if done constantly. But its still good to recognize your peers effort even if sometimes it results in the wrong outcome. reply pxc 13 hours agorootparentFake praise isn&#x27;t recognition, though. It verges on (and sometimes is quite intentionally) mockery. reply jahsome 15 hours agorootparentprevI personally prefer earnest over disingenuous. There are fewer opportunities to misunderstand.A question by it&#x27;s nature isn&#x27;t aggressive. The words \"should\" and \"we\" are the real cancers IMO, as in \"we should have done...\"I think your example of have you thought about, vs. Why did you is potentially better but I personally don&#x27;t have an issue answering either question or feel attacked in either case.I would on the other hand be concerned about working with someone immature enough to read in so far to perfectly innocuous curiosity. reply jcuenod 12 hours agorootparentThere are intelligent people who are great at ingenuous praise. I&#x27;m not one of them, but often in striving for the former, I fail at the latter. Smart people are able to find things that are praiseworthy, which gives greater credibility to questions and critique. reply gizmo686 14 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on context, but I have found the opposite.\"Have you thought about this approach\" can come across as condcending.

Of course I thought about that, it was the first thing I tried before the much more complicated solution that actually works.This is what I want to hear. Tell me you first considered it and ruled it out because of XYZ. No where am I saying “I think you’re incompetent and I would have done it this way”. On the contrary, I think you’re the right person for the job and I want to hear the assessment of the various other approaches (if any) and why yours fits the bill. It could be as simple as “well, mine does Y, others don’t”. Next time someone asks you about your approach, try not to assume they are trying to belittle you or get you into a “gotcha” situation.I’m sorry that you had bad managers in the past and are hurt by someone asking about your methods. I genuinely want to know so I can defend the choice to the higher ups on your behalf. reply pluijzer 14 hours agorootparentprevBut your example are cases where you feel strong because you have this war story. How about the cases where you just made a mistake?That said, I never liked the &#x27;sandwhich&#x27; method, saying; \"Great effort. The result is horrible, like your indentation though.\" reply II2II 5 hours agorootparentThe value of the sandwich method depends upon some sort of equivalence of the praise. It may have taken hours or days of work to produce the code that generated horrible results, while indentation would likely register as a triviality. To choose a better example: \"Your code is great. The results were off, but how you structured it made it easy to isolate the problem.\"Overall I agree with your assessment though. People giving this sort of feedback usually focus upon the problem and grasp at straws when it comes to the compliment. reply gizmo686 13 hours agorootparentprev\"war story\" is a bit strong, but most of the time I don&#x27;t go with the obvious solution, there was some investigating done that led to the conclusion that the obvious solution wouldn&#x27;t work.The trick is to know who you are talking to. If they did think of your idea, accusing them of having missed it is offensive. If they didn&#x27;t consider it, asking them to justify their reasoning puts them on the spot. reply thegrimmest 13 hours agorootparentprevThen you should be glad someone pointed out your mistake, improved the work, and gave you an opportunity to learn. You should be thanking them. reply fatherzine 10 hours agorootparentprev\"I see you went with ${solution X}, which is reasonable, though it suffers of ${major downside K} in fairly common ${situation T}. Would ${solution Y} address ${major downside K}?

Can you tell me your thoughts about the decision you arrived at?“have you thought about this approach?” You probably couldn’t imagine this possibility, let me do it for you. Checkmate!I can also see how they could each be interpreted in the opposite directions.I’m betting it’s more about the contextual body language and tone they’re delivered with than the words&#x2F;sentences themselves that matters, which I just don’t see being that different once you look behind them to see the gist of the message.That’s the double edged sword of text-only communication: you can choose to interpret everything charitably, but you can also infer a condescending tone even if it wasn’t intended.Expecting people to wordsmith to your individual taste is just asking for otherwise fine coworkers to be mind readers. reply II2II 5 hours agorootparentRather than asking \"why didn&#x27;t you do it this way?\" you could ask \"why did you choose this approach?\", but only do so if you are prepared to acknowledge their reasoning may be valid (and, ideally, you are known for accepting justifiable approaches). reply RobRivera 14 hours agorootparentprevI dont think it is good faith to label different communication styles as poor social skills. Many a DnD nerd have no problems communicating, but simply have a different communication style than johhny the quarterback. Part of diversity is understanding cultural differences as much as style.I love being told short, crisp, critical feedbacj that is data dense. Any overly verbose communication adds a layer of parsing and interpretation which may be unnecessarily ambiguous, which is more costly and for the benefit of what? a subjective opinion that it is &#x27;more social&#x27;?As with most things, it depends and knowing your audience goes miles. reply ska 14 hours agorootparentThe social skill is having different communication styles, and applying them appropriately.Only having one is a form of poor social skills. reply sopooneo 8 hours agorootparentprevI have personally switched my default communication style to the \"have you thought about this approach?\" style because I found it worked better with most people. Still, for me, I dislike it. Coming from a lot of people, I find it not what they really mean, which puts me on edge. reply dahwolf 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not aggressive and being critical of work deliverables is the very point of quality assurance.It doesn&#x27;t mean you have to be mean about it, but you can just spit it out. reply ori_b 14 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen this style of communication generally work as a viable substitute for social skills and good will towards colleagues.Wrapping of criticism in praise is a poor substitute for genuinely praising good work, and being empathetic and helpful with direct, unambiguous feedback when someone can improve. Mistakes are inevitable. They&#x27;re not a problem. It&#x27;s ok to discuss them directly. reply pxc 13 hours agorootparentprev> \"Why didn&#x27;t you do it this way?\" is aggressive and critical.&#x27;Why didn&#x27;t you do it this way?&#x27; reveals an expectation that you would have done whatever it was &#x27;this way&#x27;, but it doesn&#x27;t indicate that that expectation is normative. A junior might well ask that just because &#x27;this way&#x27; is the only way they know how to do it, and they&#x27;re curious about whether the developer they&#x27;re asking chose a different route for stylistic reasons, performance reasons, or out of some entirely different consideration. Nothing critical about it.Inferring criticism from mere surprise may be uncomfortable, but it also seems a kind of misapprehension that will very quickly sort itself out as the conversation goes on.In contrast to the case above, by the way, &#x27;have you thought about this [other] approach?&#x27; does imply that the asker knows better because it very directly and explicitly raises the possibility that the one being asked hasn&#x27;t even considered alternative implementations. reply eweise 13 hours agorootparent\"Aggressive and critical\" I couldn&#x27;t find the right words initially but a better word might be accusatory. To me, it sounds like they should have but didn&#x27;t. A lot of other posters don&#x27;t get that flavor from it and see it as just a genuine curiosity which makes sense. reply pxc 11 hours agorootparent> To me, it sounds like they should have but didn&#x27;t. A lot of other posters don&#x27;t get that flavor from it and see it as just a genuine curiosity which makes sense.Imo a lot of the difficulty with things like this comes from high turnover and&#x2F;or siloing. When you&#x27;re working with someone who is basically a stranger, that means you&#x27;ve hardly had a chance to build up a real sense of rapport&#x2F;trust&#x2F;comfort with that person. So it&#x27;s easier to doubt yourself and harder to know what the other person really intends.Most differences in communication style or preferences about how to approach criticism are at least somewhat easier to deal with between people who know each other and understand what their particular differences are. reply camel_gopher 14 hours agorootparentprevMy goto is “can you help me understand x?” reply eweise 13 hours agorootparentI guess any style could be interpreted many ways. If something was hard to understand, it sounds sincere but if you actually do understand then it could sound condescending. I guess with all this, context matters. reply borroka 15 hours agorootparentprevIt is the HR-motivated eternal infantilization of the people. In fact, to the person who went through mental and physical developments with no blockages or traumas, it comes across as a quite paternalistic way of communicating, but it is a style liked and embraced by corporate coaches, HR, and the informal CYA policies. reply gabereiser 14 hours agorootparentI disagree. Rather strongly actually. I’ve had bad managers that couldn’t communicate. I’ve been that manager. I’ve learned how to communicate to be more effective with others. Everyone has blockages and traumas (especially now). It’s important to use those in context and draw from that experience. It’s not HR motivated, it’s a style of empathetic communication. reply borroka 13 hours agorootparentIt is important not to think of black-white alternatives. The style \"good job, kid!\", \"great effort, little man&#x2F;woman!\" is undoubtedly paternalistic.There are people who like this style on both sides of the conversation, but in my experience, these are not high performers who make a difference in an initiative, a company, or a group of friends.Now, the alternative to paternalism is not rudeness, or brutality, but, as I see it, a clear communication that does not infantilize people, but treat them seriously, like serious adult people, and not kids who have to be coddled or paid excessive attention too, or, even worse, as \"damaged goods\".A few years ago, I received a message from someone I had a date with, and they used the sandwich, paternalistic style of communication that most adults dislike. \"Hi, it was great to meet you and we had such a great time. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think it would work etc. I wish you the very best&#x2F;you are a great guy&#x2F;see you around\". Unsurprisingly, they were working in corporate. It is annoying to be treated like kids when there are white hairs on semi-bald heads. reply madeofpalk 15 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think it has to be that deep. The world is a big place, full of many cultures that operate - especially with giving criticism - very differently. You don’t need to master the tone of every culture, but it’s important to at least be cognisant that even these difference exist. reply borroka 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see my comment as particularly profound.I have lived for a few decades at this point and have noticed, like anyone else I imagine, a desire in (some, but a nontrivial percentage of) people to maintain lifelong ways of thinking and behaving that have been historically associated with early life.For example, a desire to be praised and not challenged, to dress like a teenager even as one nears retirement, to show a degree of enthusiasm for pedestrian events that was once reserved for major accomplishments. reply pbourke 12 hours agorootparent> to dress like a teenager even as one nears retirementFor some of us this is a KPI of our life&#x2F;job satisfaction.I can tell you that if I was in some job that did not allow me to schlep around in hoodies and cargo pants I would be much, much less happy than I am today. reply borroka 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t like to judge the appearance of others and prefer just to maintain high standards for myself. My comment was descriptive and not normative.I like working out and being in shape, but if others prefer to do some side project at night instead of hitting weights, it is fine with me. I enjoy reading and thinking, but if others prefer to watch reality tv, who am I to judge them?Admittedly, seeing some of my middle-aged colleagues who are complete slobs, from their worn-out clothes to their prominent bellies to their unkempt hair and beards and some fun smell coming out of them, is a stress-test for the fortitude of my beliefs. replygraypegg 15 hours agorootparentprevI kind of agree, I don’t want to work with a HR robot. I know someone that talks like this to non-coworker friends and it’s honestly just… offputting.I’m more into “ehhh honestly not how I would do it. The {problem} will cause issues down the road”. And that opens up a two ended respectful conversation. Someone telling that to me, I’m not going to think they’re being an asshole.I’ve learned a lot from people stopping me from firing a footgun directly into my… foot. reply neilv 14 hours agorootparent> “ehhh honestly not how I would do it. The {problem} will cause issues down the road”If the context is that someone is speaking about something they think they know, and which would be acted upon, what about phrasing the concern as a question, like \"How does that approach handle {problem}?\"?(Not that I always practice this, because I don&#x27;t. But probably it&#x27;s generally best if I don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;m right. Risks include people who misinterpret question-asking.) reply gabereiser 14 hours agorootparent>”How does that approach handle {problem}?\"This is good so long as it’s framed in a use-case. Like, we need to handle sending emails (simple example), How does your approach solve the need to send emails? Demonstrate it.It’s important that we remember we are talking about praise, not criticism here. Something often lost on the rest of the commenters here. reply breakfastduck 14 hours agorootparentprevthats even more patronizing imo. reply neilv 14 hours agorootparentAre you assuming that you&#x27;re right? reply graypegg 13 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s about tone; it feels patronizing to me as well. \"How does this approach handle {problem}?\" is very socratic. You&#x27;re asking a question meant to make them reconsider their idea in a very round about way. I think that actually comes off as assuming you&#x27;re right in this conversation. I would imagine the person asking me that is being a snobby asshole showing off how intelligent they are. It&#x27;s on the other person to try and piece together your wisdom you&#x27;ve delivered in cryptic socratic whataboutisms.If two doctors are having a conversation about a treatment, do you think they have these roundabout conversations or do they just say \"No, his liver is shot, he can&#x27;t take that.\" We&#x27;re professionals too. We should have enough mutual respect for each other to be upfront. reply projectazorian 12 hours agorootparent> \"How does this approach handle {problem}?\" is very socratic.

I’m fine being told that. If you’re working with level headed people, that starts a two way respectful conversation.Honestly that’s just my mileage I guess. Maybe it depends on everyone’s own personal attachment to their ideas, but if someone thinks I’m about to pull the footgun trigger, I want them to tell me that.If they’re right, they saved my foot.If they’re wrong, I show them that the safety is on, and we go on.Getting all “well what is it you expect to accomplish with that? Is this aligned with the incentives of the team? If there was a safety would it be on, hypothetically?” just serves to muddy the message and come off “smarter than thou”. I’d call it manager speak. replyrectang 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve found that people who prefer to receive \"direct\" critiques don&#x27;t object to genuine praise accompanying suggestions, and so there&#x27;s no need to adapt communication styles to omit praise.But I personally can&#x27;t adapt to the subset of people who spin a preference for receiving \"direct\" critiques into a penchant for giving critiques with no consideration whatever for preserving the face of the recipient.My worst experiences have been with people who make a big deal about being \"direct\" but are actually quite psychologically astute and who find ways to smuggle maximum cruelty within their \"direct\" critiques, yet without going over the line where a sanction would be justified. reply anon84873628 15 hours agorootparentprevAre you saying you don&#x27;t want to work with the people who use praise w&#x2F; direction?

And when I get genuine compliments, I like them!But it&#x27;s obvious when someone consistently prefaces their statements with \"softening\" compliments. When they&#x27;re \"deploying\" a \"communications strategy.\"Talk to me like a real person, please. It will make it easier for those compliments to land when recipients know they&#x27;re real. But if you&#x27;re the type to always lead with one, then they&#x27;re all worthless. You&#x27;re just a happy-talker. Your praise is empty. reply trifurcate 13 hours agorootparentI always have doubts about others&#x27; work and suggestions on how they could do it better. To avoid constantly dominating others, I either have to shut my mouth or try to be more accommodating in how I deliver my feedback. I do a mix of both, but if you tell me to be straight with you, then I&#x27;ll be straight with you.Especially in large corporate organizations where there are vast differences in how people communicate and take input, and you talk to too many people in a given day to really get close with any of them, it requires a handshake to know that I can always indicate my roughly unfiltered technical opinion to you and that you&#x27;ll take it in stride, and if you feel strongly about it, you&#x27;ll have the confidence to shoot my idea down without me having to give you an opening by posing my suggestion as a question. reply thegrimmest 13 hours agorootparentThis should just be the default. Many organizations do in fact write this down in their internal communication guides, where it&#x27;s known as the ABCs (accuracy, brevity, clarity) of professional communication.> I always have doubts about others&#x27; work and suggestions on how they could do it betterIf you&#x27;re right, they should listen to you (gratefully), if you&#x27;re not they should tell you why so you can learn. There is no good reason to react emotionally to professional criticism, it is a worst-practice which no measures ought be taken to accommodate. reply trifurcate 13 hours agorootparent> There is no good reason to react emotionally to professional criticism.And yet when it happens (not a rare event), it can be quite unproductive for both parties. I would hope that you deal with other worst-practices in your domain with greater grace than a total refusal to deal with and prevent pathological outcomes.Additionally, if you truly believe what you stated, then so long as I avoid sacrificing significant efficiency&#x2F;productivity to keep my words from bothering people, then I do not see why it should bother you either. If I had to self-judge, I really don&#x27;t think that the added conversational padding pans out to more than 15 minutes per day. That&#x27;s worth spending to make sure that the people you work with are engaged with you and the task at hand in an accommodating way, rather than fearing being rebuked at each turn. reply thegrimmest 12 hours agorootparent> And yet when it happensWhen it does happen, like any other mistake, it should be corrected. Just like if someone put secrets into git, it should be explained to them why they shouldn&#x27;t do that, and an expectation should be set not to do it again. If the individual fails to meet that expectation, disciplinary action should be taken, up to and including termination.I&#x27;ve in fact had this happen to a developer who took PR comments personally. The rest of the team was very glad to see them terminated. Fifteen minutes per day adds up to a lot, and I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s more for staff whose roles are heavier on communication or those for whom anticipating people&#x27;s feelings comes less naturally.> rather than fearing being rebuked at each turnMy point is that a fear of professional criticism is a fundamental flaw in a professional, one that should be corrected to the benefit of the individual and the organization. A leader who refuses to correct this flaw in their reports is holding back their professional development and failing in their role as mentor. One should experience nothing but sublime gratitude that one&#x27;s mistakes were found and corrected before they caused any damage. reply trifurcate 10 hours agorootparentI actually agree with most of the points you&#x27;ve made here. I think the difference lies in what context this feedback is relayed to a teammate.If I&#x27;m tasked with a code review, that is pretty much a directive for me to offer feedback. When I am asked explicitly for feedback, whether directly by my peer or as assigned by a higher up, I tend not to bother with the kind of niceties I am talking about. Still, being nice is nice. But I expect the other person to take my words as-is, so I won&#x27;t mince them.Accommodating others becomes more important to me outside of this \"directly asked for feedback\" context. If I&#x27;m in a group discussion, or if my feedback hasn&#x27;t been explicitly solicited, then that&#x27;s a trickier environment with greater potential for me to negatively dominate the discussion. Similarly, if the issue at hand is not one of baseline technical necessity (like committing secrets to git) but more open to different opinions (like how to structure an interface we&#x27;re exposing), I place greater weight on trying to be accommodating. I find that most discussions tend to be of the latter kind. replyqwytw 14 hours agorootparentprev\"Hey I’m glad you patched the bug, but..\"To me that just sounds passive aggressive and sort of like \"you should mind your own business\".I&#x27;d feel better you if someone just told me: \"I saw you patched a bug, could you do X\"or even just \"can you give the SREs a heads up next time?\" alone.Then again I&#x27;m used to a culture where any praise is ussually implicit and criticism tends to be quite explicit so it&#x27;s easy to interpret words like \"glad\" etc. as insincere by default without even wanting too.. reply anon84873628 13 hours agorootparentBecause the example is oversimplified for the sake of HN commentary.

The Ops team thought we had to work late tonight to implement mitigations for the problem.In fact, it looks like we had a communication breakdown and they didn&#x27;t realize you had fixed the issue until 6 hours later. In the future do you think you could let them know when this sort of problem is fixed, just to make sure we&#x27;re all on the same page? We&#x27;ll have to look at a solution for automated alerts too -- maybe an integration with the ticket system or build system. Do you have any ideas for that so we don&#x27;t have to rely on manual communication? We&#x27;re moving so fast that it&#x27;s hard for everyone to keep up!

However when I say good things about you, that cannot be accept in just as straightforward a way, and instead it is viewed as passive aggressive.You don’t see the asymmetry there? reply allarm 26 minutes agorootparentYou don’t seem to understand the reasons why I would consider it passive aggressive, and it’s my fault because I didn’t explain it. Thing is, in my culture exactly this phrasing had been a form of passive aggressive tone that had been very common way of working communication. I’m not sure if that’s still the case - I’ve left my country years ago. But this exact phrasing is a strong trigger.> However when I say good things about youYeah, I read it as the exact opposite, in this particular phrasing. Historical reasons.In fact I’m on the SRE side in this example, and I often have to remind people to suppress alerts when they change something. I normally go with “We got paged for the planned works, could you please turn off alerts next time? Thanks”. I’m not thanking people for their job in this case because it’s likely irrelevant - we’re from different teams and chances are I don’t even know what exactly they’ve been working on (in a broad sense) or for what reason. I’m being polite and straightforward. Never got any complain, at least so far. replyedgarvaldes 15 hours agorootparentprev>I really liked how you tackled thisBecause you open the communication with a lie. reply koliber 15 hours agorootparentSuch communication style can work well, but only if it is genuine. When people do mess up, there is often something good in the mix. It’s possible to lead with a compliment to point out what was done well, and follow up with constructive criticism. It’s about style. When done well, you don’t notice it and you like it. If done awkwardly or stiffly, it feels fake, patronizing, and disingenuous. reply qwytw 14 hours agorootparentThe shit sandwich approach...But yeah if you&#x27;re a person who&#x27;s only capable of complaining and criticizing others (assuming it&#x27;s perfectly legitimate&#x2F;reasonable) you might struggle communicating with most people who don&#x27;t know you really well&#x2F;are used to different culture. reply gretch 14 hours agorootparentprevWell, only if it is a lie. The example is a hypothetical story so we can read into it whatever we want.There are ways to like someone’s work, even if you don’t think it’s complete or optimal.For example, I think a huge part of getting a job done is just having someone take initiative and at least try, as opposed to waiting for someone else to start them off.The line might mean “I’m glad you started us down this road…” reply skrebbel 15 hours agorootparentprevIm not the GP but it hides all clarity wrt how important the colleague thinks the “directions” that the praise came along with are. If I accept the praise but dismiss the directions, am I being an asshole? Or am I being subordinate? Am I ignoring a direct order? The boss was in the room and they didn’t object to the directions! What does it all mean?All this is a level of 4D interpersonal chess that you’re forcing me to play that could simply be avoided if you said that you think its worth changing it like so and so because such and such. reply anon84873628 15 hours agorootparentFair point. I think it comes down to knowing your audience, which is always the most fundamental and important part. Coworkers with lots of rapport can be very direct with each other. Or a neurodivergent person who struggles with social&#x2F;verbal cues may be much better served with succinct direct feedback (and likewise not feel the sting and demotivation that the initial strategy is intended to avoid) reply camhart 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause its confusing. Don&#x27;t say that you like something when you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a failure to communicate. reply esafak 15 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a cultural and personal thing. Consider the recipient&#x27;s preferences.If you would like to learn about these cultural preferences, read Erin Meyer&#x27;s The Culture Map. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;erinmeyer.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;the-culture-map&#x2F; reply ori_b 15 hours agorootparentYes. If you like that kind of culture, feel free to seek it out.I would not enjoy that kind of workplace, and if I accidentally join a place that leaned very heavily on that communication style, I would likely leave quickly. reply bumby 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s something to be said to adapting to the environment rather than expecting the environment to fit your whims. Sometimes you should change your approach in the vein of being more effective at your job. Most reasonably sized organizations are going to have a mixed of people with different preferences; jumping ship every time the culture doesn&#x27;t meet your ideal seems like you may end up switching jobs often enough to not have much of an impact. (I know job-hopping is a discussion all its own) reply ori_b 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also something to be said for not working in environments you dislike if you don&#x27;t need to. Especially since cultural mismatches grate and lead to underperformance.Given that I have consistently gotten thanked for how I give and take feedback from colleagues, I think I will be fine on finding organizations that work for me culturally.(Edit: And no, that praise didn&#x27;t contain \"but I wish...\"es.) reply bumby 14 hours agorootparentIf you can find something fulfilling that is a good cultural fit, great. But lots of people get caught up in the \"grass is always greener somewhere else\" mentality and end up job swapping constantly to find some mythical culture that perfectly aligns with them. And maybe that works if your primary goal is what&#x27;s in it for you. But it can also have the effect of minimizing your impact, which is counter-productive for a goal of contributing to something beyond yourself.The point that may have gone missed in my original comment was the perspective was focused on \"being effective\" and not \"working somewhere I like\". One is somewhat selfish, the other is not.FWIW, I&#x27;m not saying anyone should have to care about their impact. It&#x27;s just ironic when I see people constantly job-hopping with the stated goal of finding a cultural fit so they can have said impact. reply conception 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is why the Golden Rule is wrong. Not “Do unto others as you would have them to do to you.” but instead “Do unto others how they uhh want to be done unto.” Different folks, different strokes. reply johnnyanmac 14 hours agorootparentProblem is that you don&#x27;t know what others want and it takes time to establish that. Even then they may not necessarily know what they want. People change their minds.It&#x27;s a rule of thumb regardless. not an ironclad rule. generally, people want to be treated respectfully, so treat them respectfully and course correct if cultural&#x2F;social lines demand it. reply esafak 15 hours agorootparentprevSome call that the Platinum Rule. reply playing_colours 13 hours agorootparentprevI think it is a matter of culture. I personally would prefer a straightforward approach, and I think many of my German colleagues, but I think my British colleagues would prefer that indirect way of communications. reply wkjagt 12 hours agorootparentprevI also hate this. When someone tells me they really like how I did something, when they clearly don&#x27;t and only say so to package their criticism, I find it hard to take their criticism seriously because at that point I no longer know which parts are honest anymore. But it seems to be a cultural thing. I&#x27;ve noticed when I moved from The Netherlands to North America, that people here are often less direct, and actually appreciate the packaging. People seem to be more easily shocked when things are said in a more direct way. It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but going from one culture to another it can cause unpleasant situations, on both sides. reply pickingdinner 10 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s tough to argue against better communication and kinder words, but having to care about someone&#x27;s feelings (ego) when just trying to solve a problem is a problem in itself, and if you&#x27;re a competent engineer, then it&#x27;s the much harder problem.I&#x27;d rather work with someone who says, \"fuck, why did I do it this way,\" first. To that I&#x27;d say, \"it&#x27;s not the end of the world, let&#x27;s get on this.\" reply dahwolf 13 hours agorootparentprevMe neither.

You didn&#x27;t like how I tackled it at all. You can just say that and point to tangible things where I went wrong. Any working professional should be able to handle that. And not just that, embrace it, it&#x27;s a learning experience. reply mavelikara 14 hours agorootparentprevI really like how direct you have been in stating your preference, but have you thought about an approach where tailoring your message to the audience to produce the best reception? reply f1shy 14 hours agorootparentprev>> “I really liked how you tackled this, have you thought about this approach?” Instead of “Why didn’t you do it this way?”So, basically lie in the face.

Actually it sucked. Keep going.” reply gabereiser 16 hours agorootparent“Great work” is an outcome. “Great effort” is an effort praise. It can still suck and you can still have great effort. You can’t have Great Work and it sucks. reply freedomben 16 hours agorootparentwhat&#x27;s the difference between \"Great work\" and \"I really liked how you tackled this\" ?I assume it&#x27;s a sports analogy for american football or similar. If you try to tackle an opposing player and you miss or do a bad job, \"I really liked how you tackled \" is clearly talking about the work, not the effort. If you were talking about the effort, it should be something like, \"that was a good attempt!\" It&#x27;s kind of like, \"Nice shot!\" when the person actually missed the goal. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense. reply boneitis 16 hours agorootparentI think their point (in this discussion here) can make sense and remain true to the point (made in the example statement) by adjusting the feedback segue to something like \"I really [appreciate that] you tackled this\". reply freedomben 15 hours agorootparentYes, exactly, I agree. That&#x27;s the point I&#x27;ve been trying (and obviously failing) to get through. reply gabereiser 14 hours agorootparentTackling is analogous to achieving. To put effort into and complete. To complete a tough subject. “to seize, take hold of, or grapple with especially with the intention of stopping or subduing” reply hotnfresh 16 hours agorootparentprevWebster’s 1913 (as in, the 1913 edition of the dictionary) relates this sense as “grappling with”, as in wrestling, and provides an example from a Dublin University publication to illustrate this exact idiomatic usage we’re discussing.I’d say it’s not derived from American football. reply freedomben 15 hours agorootparentthank you for sharing that (truly that is interesting data), but how do you know that GP was using the Webster&#x27;s 1913 definition? reply hotnfresh 15 hours agorootparentI cited an old source to make it clearer that this is not a new sense, and that its entry into English probably had nothing to do with American Football, which existed in 1913 but was still far from being the sport of the US.I’d have cited the OED instead, if I had access. I bet it’s got examples of this usage dating back to 1500 or something. It’s simply a sense of the word, now, hardly even figurative at all (as “grapple” barely is, in some similar senses, now) reply joshuamorton 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause \"tackling a problem\" is about the approach. That&#x27;s how the phrase is commonly understood. The Webster&#x27;s reference is just backup.Dictionary.com provides \"Make determined efforts to deal with (a problem or difficult task).\" As the first verb form, before the football&#x2F;rugby definition.Further, the hn guidelines suggest that even if there was more ambiguity, we should presume the strongest interpretation. reply koliber 15 hours agorootparentprevThe latter provides a tiny bit more detail about what you are praising. It is still lacking in concrete details though and can be improved by adding more about what you liked about why you liked how they tackled it. reply skeeter2020 15 hours agorootparentprevand while outcomes are... great it&#x27;s the effort that should be prioritized because we want that brought to all initiatives, not just the ones where you&#x27;re going to be successful.

Shit sandwich? Call it what you will. If it is genuine and true, lead with the good and deliver the bad afterwards works wonders. While not everyone reacts that way, many people get defensive if you lead with the bad, and won’t hear the good as something good. reply anon84873628 15 hours agorootparentprevThe pithiness of the example is not doing any favors. In the real world there would be much more substance. reply thenose 16 hours agorootparentprevNot at all. The trick is to force yourself to find something about their approach that you liked. There&#x27;s almost always something likable.It&#x27;s also the trick to being liked in general. Not everyone cares about that, but I&#x27;ve found it more of an asset than a distraction. reply mananaysiempre 15 hours agorootparent> Not at all [a lie]. The trick is to force yourself to find something about their approach that you liked.A lie is not always a falsehood; it is rather any use of communication with the deliberate intention of worsening somebody’s idea of the state of the world, and cherry-picking evidence (your “trick”) very much counts. I’d say it’s a very popular approach, even. You’re welcome to use a different word than “lie” here if you want, but my point is that either way the result is the same: the target is now worse off in their knowledge than they previously were.In the spirit of Harry Frankfurt’s definition, bullshit is the same as a lie but instead the perpetrator wants to change somebody’s perception of the world with disregard to the actual state of it, not in contradiction to that state.So from your description I’m not sure if your “trick” counts as lying or bullshitting: generally speaking, adjusting your logic or evidence to arrive at a predetermined conclusion is bullshit, but that you talk about a “trick” suggests an acknowledgment that you’re deliberately not communicating your best idea of reality, which would make it a lie.But it’s definitely one of the two, and regardless of which it is I still think it’s quite bad, both in the immediate sense of not letting the other person (if you’re right) or you (if you’re wrong) learn, and in the sense of eroding the conventions of honest communication in ways that make it harder for others to learn in the future. reply mlsu 5 hours agorootparentThe trick is to have a genuine respect, interest, and empathy for another person&#x27;s approach, even if you disagree.If you just take a superficial facsimile of what is suggested, without the actual respect and empathy, it will sound like bullshit as you say: it is.But stopping to condition yourself to be empathetic first is a way of, I guess, bootstrapping that respect and empathy.It&#x27;s a low bar that people frequently don&#x27;t clear. reply user_named 16 hours agorootparentprevNo, it&#x27;s absolutely horrible. It means you think the person you&#x27;re talking to is dumb and can be manipulated with this phrasing. They see through you. reply OmarShehata 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s manipulative only if there really is no redeeming quality to their approach, which, in any realistic scenario there probably is.I interpret this as, not that you should lie, you should just NOT focus 100% on the negative aspect. At the very least you can thank them for taking the time & effort to implement this solution & test it or w&#x2F;e (I assume they did \"some\" work & put in some amount of well meaning effort).If I can&#x27;t genuinely find anything to praise about something I want to criticism, it&#x27;s a sign that it&#x27;s pretty bad (or I have a bad working relationship with this person) and that is a bigger, separate problem reply johnnyanmac 15 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t be seen through then. Actually appreciate your co-workers and see the good qualities in them.Some of y&#x27;all are really overthinking the example.

The problem with not using simple communication niceties is that you not only put the other person on defensive, you put yourself on defensive when your opinions on the approach end up wrong.Yes, there are clear times when some work doesn&#x27;t meet standard and it&#x27;s important to be very straight forward. But, most of the time we&#x27;re dealing in shades of grey with different tradeoffs. reply lelandbatey 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not intended to be manipulative or lying, it&#x27;s meant as shorthand for saying:\"I&#x27;ve reviewed your work and I have feedback.

I also found P and Q to be deficient in ways A and B; unless there are additional factors I do not understand, I recommend making changes G and K to areas P and Q.\"But that&#x27;s a lot of words framed very stiffly, and despite being framed extremely flatly, may still be received poorly.

If you can&#x27;t get your point across without calling my (or your) person into question, we have much bigger issues at play. replygabereiser 16 hours agorootparentprevLet’s break down your version: “I think it would be better if…” You start with an opinion. That’s going to cause any listener to put up their guard. It’s the beginning of any sort of confrontations. By saying “Thank you for the effort…” you are acknowledging the work they put into it and showing empathy by seeing their work they have done. If it isn’t correct, either it should have been course corrected by management or volunteer for the next one. If you think something should be done a certain away across the board, create a brown bag or lunch and learn where you evangelize it and get consensus.You aren’t lying when you give praise about someone’s effort (unless they gave none, in which case why are you praising to begin with?), you would be lying if you said “You did a great job” when the solution is potentially tech debt for later. It’s a matter of communication and human behavior.You wouldn’t praise someone by saying “I think it could be better”. reply freedomben 16 hours agorootparentYour second example is a good one and I agree is a more effective approach to communicating.But GP was right. There&#x27;s a huge difference between your first example:> “I really liked how you tackled this, have you thought about this approach?”and the second:> “Thank you for the effort…”The first is most likely a lie, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be offering an alternative suggestion! If somebody said that to me I&#x27;d feel extremely patronized and would consider that person very disingenuous. reply Kalium 16 hours agorootparentThese approaches and how effective they are are both culturally and individually sensitive.The \"Yes, but\" approach works well in a context where people understand it as feedback that they should change. Softening the criticism with praise works for many people. It can also backfire in a context where people distrust praise, where the criticism is not understood as such, or when people have trouble with American business idioms.The more direct approach works better in other contexts. I have had coworkers who responded much better to blunt criticism about why they should do things differently than to a praise sandwich.This gets very tricky if you are interacting with multiple very different people at once. What is a strong enough criticism for one person might be well below detectable for another. There isn&#x27;t one ideal answer or approach. reply thegrimmest 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a lot easier to teach many people how to receive communication in one style than it is to teach everyone to send communication in many styles. We can, and many organizations do, write style guides for internal communication. The most successful such style guides (eg. military, intelligence) emphasize the ABCs (accuracy, brevity, clarity) any to avoid extraneous verbiage.If your coworkers respond negatively to a simple, direct question like \"Why didn&#x27;t you do it this way?\", they can be trained to handle professional communication more dispassionately (more professionally). reply gabereiser 4 hours agorootparentThere’s a whole division dedicated to undoing military communication style to adapt it to the real world in the private sector. Just FYI. Also, the word “didn’t” doesn’t exist in that communication style… “unable”, “status red”, “negative”, “not able”. The words “can’t” and “didn’t” are stricken. reply gabereiser 16 hours agorootparentprevOffering a different point of view helps either confirm their decisions or open up avenues for improvement of their work. It’s not about telling “this is how I would do it” but rather “Have you thought about other options and approaches? What do you think? Why did you choose this route?” helps the individual weigh the pros and cons with each. It should never be an opportunity for you to chime in with how you would have done it (even if you would have done it that way). You simply want to expose the other possibilities so that they are aware of them and haven’t overlooked a potential savings or killer-feature. reply hmcq6 16 hours agorootparent\"I like the way you tackeled this\" Implies the work has been done successfully. \", have you thought about this approach?\" is trying to imply that the work is not sufficient actually without actually saying that. Your message has taken a complete 180 since the first half of the sentence but you haven&#x27;t given the listener any clues because if you use a word like \"but\" it might hurt the facade of niceness. It&#x27;s mixed messaging.But I think a lot of the issue here is because were talking about a made up example. If we just add a little more detail to the made up response it clears up a lot of the ambiguity and makes it sound less contradictory.\"I really liked how you tackled [X Requirement], have you thought about [Y Requirement + approach]?\" reply freedomben 16 hours agorootparentprevto be clear, I fully agree with this and your broader point. It&#x27;s the specific verbiage in your first example that I think is problematic, mainly because it feels disingenuous and insincere at best, manipulative at worst. Which is highly unfortunate because I think the vast majority of the time the motives are pure! reply BytesAndGears 16 hours agorootparentIt’s funny because I still feel the opposite of you — I think the example where you say that you like their solution is a better approach, as long as it’s not horrible.It leaves open the possibility that you as the reviewer are actually mistaken, and they possibly have a good reason for doing it that way.I may be the senior reviewing the junior’s code, but they probably spent longer looking at the problem than me and there is a chance that I’m missing something. By suggesting “have you considered this, it may be able to handle x situation better”, you respect their work more.It depends on context though, if somebody clearly just didn’t understand something obvious, then I’ll just tell them directly.Either way, probably a difference in our opinions of feedback, you might prefer more directness than me reply freedomben 15 hours agorootparentinteresting indeed, thank you!> It leaves open the possibility that you as the reviewer are actually mistaken, and they possibly have a good reason for doing it that way.That&#x27;s a great point.

The (very real) possibility of being wrong exists, but declaring that because of it nobody ever—or you specifically—can be right seems overkill and contradictory to the ethos of the engineering profession and the approach it uses for its chosen range of problems.(I have the vague impression that people who talk along these lines usually think that being wrong is somehow a bad thing, or at least that even if they personally don’t others do and those others need to be accomodated.Of course, while being wrong might not be pleasant, it’s absolutely necessary, and the harder the problem is the more times you’ll need to be wrong before you solve it. Thus shaming people for being wrong, especially in an educational setting, is one of the very small number of things that make me genuinely furious. Not telling people they’re wrong when [you think] they are because you think they might feel shame because of it is... not as bad, but still feels seriously counterproductive. I can’t say I have a grip on how to train or at least help others out of that shame, though.Is your motivation different here?

Instead, it&#x27;s a call to evaluate people on multiple dimensions rather than one.When you&#x27;re giving feedback to someone, it is often a knee jerk thing to ONLY evaluate the outcome of their work. The other thing you should evaluate, though, is your estimation of their effort, e.g. how hard they worked at it, and your estimation of their process, e.g. how well they used their time.If you only evaluate the outcome of their work, and the work is not adequate, you have given them a purely negative evaluation. If you acknowledge respect for their toil and their process, then you have given them 2 positive evaluations and 1 negative evaluation. You&#x27;re also acknowledging that because you respect their toil and process, they are doing the right thing in spite of needing the course correction you are providing.Of course, maybe you have a negative opinion on all 3 aspects of the evaluation. If you think they didn&#x27;t apply themselves, e.g. their effort was not good enough, AND you think they were&#x27;t efficient in their process, AND you think the outcome was bad, then certainly it would be a lie to praise any of those aspects, though at that point there&#x27;s almost certainly something more fundamental that&#x27;s going on and the person is not a good fit for the job.Finally, it&#x27;s important to evaluate your own sense of certainty about the feedback.I think the important thing about the above advice is that if you are giving feedback and you only focus on the course correction part, it&#x27;s safe to assume that most people will take that as negative feedback on all the aspects of their work. Now, there are situations and teams where there is so much trust built up around everyone&#x27;s mutual respect that you can skip to the outcome feedback. There are also feedback-recipients who are confident enough in themselves that they feel that they don&#x27;t need anything but correctional feedback. In other words, \"This was shit!\" can totally fly when there&#x27;s a lot of mutual trust and confidence. But too often I&#x27;ve seen people misread the room in that aspect: THEY, the feedback-givers, have plenty of psychological safety, and they think that is extended to other people who absolutely don&#x27;t feel that way. reply ajuc 16 hours agorootparentprevInterpretation depends on the culture.

Not all workplace cultures and not all people prefer to communicate this way, and many of us resent the \"YTA\" label that is applied to a direct communication style.

I couldn&#x27;t care less whether my colleagues recognize me, and business leaders don&#x27;t care about your effort; they care about the bottom line.It&#x27;s not surprising that your video relates to children. This sort of feelings-driven approach has no place in a professional workplace full of adults who are all expected to know why they&#x27;re there, the terms of their employment, and what objective they&#x27;re working towards. In fact I find it somewhat demeaning to have the default communication style be so childish.Did you notice that \"Why didn&#x27;t you do it this way?\" is rather less verbose than your alternative? This holds true in the general case too: communication tailored to your audience is much more verbose, and therefore laborious to produce, than communication written following the ABCs - accuracy, brevity, clarity. Imagine all the time that such organizations waste rewording things ad infinitum.

A submission is either adequate or not, and a review finding a submission inadequate should lay out its reasoning as clearly as possible.If you&#x27;re consistently authoring inadequate contributions, the onus is on you to figure out why, and negative emotion is a powerful tool to motivate an individual to do so. The same applies to teams and organizations that fail to meet their objectives.

I&#x27;ve tried a number of services like this, and always end up back on a spreadsheet because:1. I hate giving my data to a third party2. There always ends up being some limitation that forces me to exclude part of my assets, doesn&#x27;t let me handle something the way I wish, etc reply matthewtse 17 hours agoparentYes same! I&#x27;ve always wanted some \"simpler\" net worth tracker, still on a spreadsheet at this point.I never liked the big heavy ones with all the bells&#x2F;whistle integrations that want your password so they can log directly into your financial accounts. And the integration would always break, causing my net worth to swing by double digit percentage points. I ended up spending more time nursing the integration than actually watching my net worth. reply jollyjerry 17 hours agorootparentI expanded my spreadsheet into a webapp https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jch.app. My original thinking was to avoid broken bank syncing, but one problem I still have is how to include assets that aren&#x27;t publicly listed. For example, have funds in a retirement account that&#x27;s specific to that institution and can&#x27;t fetch updated prices. Currently getting around that by using a similar target date fund as a proxy for the price. reply xp84 9 hours agorootparentSorry if this is a dumb question, but what’s the pricing on that? When I see “sign up for free” I’m trained to expect a hidden, costly upsell.If it’s actually free it may actually be helpful to add a prominent Pricing in the nav, where you explain why it’s free, how you make money (or how you might plan to), and whether there are any catches, like selling all the data to someone (not that you’d likely do that, but if I stumbled upon the site from anywhere else, I might assume a catch exists)Anyway what I can see of this looks really professional, so nice job!

Why would I use this instead of ledger[1], for example?- [1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ledger-cli.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ledger3.html reply multicast 15 hours agoparent\"Real\" wealth management has a lot more legal work behind it since a non trivial portion of wealth management are topics like inheritance and planing for the next generation. Also wealth management is more focused on wealth preservation than generating high returns, that is more the focus of asset management (e.g. hedge funds, private equity etc.). But since this piece of software is focused on the individual the term seems applicable even though something like personal finance would be more suitable. For \"real\" wealth management you hire usually professionals. It has a lot of good and bad sides that a majority of people think that when it comes to finance they can compete on an equal level with experts who do this every day. But if your skilled you surely save a ton of fees. reply vba616 7 hours agorootparent>\"Real\" wealth management has a lot more legal work behind itThis is just me, but if I had legal work and deep pockets, I&#x27;d hire a lawyer.>a majority of people think that when it comes to finance they can compete on an equal level with experts who do this every day>But if your skilled you surely save a ton of fees.If you are \"focused on wealth preservation\" rather than \"generating high returns\", what is the need for skill?If I won the lottery, and I just sent, say, a $500M check to a regular discount broker and bought an index fund, is someone going to take it away from me? Are the wealth management divisions of every podunk bank and credit union there for a reason? Would I need to hire \"protection\"?Warren Buffett famously said he \"upon his passing, has directed the trustee for his wife’s benefit to “put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund.”And Barack Obama reportedly put all his assets in government bonds when he became President to avoid conflicts of interest.Obviously not everyone takes this sort of simple approach, but some famous examples seem to prove it&#x27;s possible. reply mikeryan 11 hours agorootparentprevAlso wealth management is more focused on wealth preservation than generating high returns, that is more the focus of asset management (e.g. hedge funds, private equity etc.).This is a bit simplistic. It’s more focused on setting a target return and cash flows consistent with your current life plans. Whether this is a defensive or more aggressive position is really up to you and your goals. But Wealth managers are about putting an investment strategy in place to achieve that. They also help actively manage your portfolio to address macroeconomic trends. reply felipellrocha 17 hours agoparentprevI would say ledger is more about knowing where your money is going, and ghostfolio is about making sure you minimize the risk of losing said money all at once after you hit a certain wealth threshold reply olejorgenb 16 hours agoparentprevCan ledger track performance over time (which I assume Ghostfolio can). Does ledger (or the eco-system around) come with integration towards sources which categorize assets, and can it easily give a breakdown of the exposure according to such categorizations (per industry, per region, etc.)? reply abdullahkhalids 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about ledger, but gnucash can track performance over time[1, 2]. I don&#x27;t think Gnucash can do your second ask on its own.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnucash.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;v5&#x2F;C&#x2F;gnucash-guide&#x2F;&#x2F;chapter_inv...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnucash.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;v5&#x2F;C&#x2F;gnucash-guide&#x2F;&#x2F;rpt_standar... reply berkes 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, no.Yes, Ledger can do all those things. No, it doesn&#x27;t do this \"out of the box\".I do most of these things. Simple, by adding meta-tags to my ledger. I&#x27;m just now working on consolidating on all my willy-nilly scripts and tools. And then plan to turn this into an actual \"investment dashboard\" ala ghostfolio but using the ledger as source.In the end, a plain-text-ledger is just a of database. And the ledger query language (e.g. bean-query-language) a way to query it and produce reports.So, what you are asking is more like \"can SQLite categorize assets, give a breakdown of the exposure according to such cats per industry, region etc\". Well, sure it can. But it&#x27;s a bit of a strange question. reply olejorgenb 13 hours agorootparentOf course it&#x27;s possible to implement these features on top of any system which stores the transactions... but I&#x27;m sure you agree that to a user it matters that these things are accessible without writing lots of willy-nilly scripts, and preferable not having to add such meta-tags manually when other sources have already categorized them.Thus I suspect there&#x27;s space for more specialized solutions like Ghostfolio. Although I myself would prefer if my accounting system could also do these things. (I&#x27;d be interested in these willy-nilly scripts. I also enjoy writing willy-nilly scripts, but time is limited)EDIT: saw the link you already posted reply berkes 47 minutes agorootparentI entirely agree. And this is why I&#x27;m building use-focused, case-specific tools around ledger&#x2F;beancount. reply lannisterstark 9 hours agorootparentprevI mean, \"It&#x27;s possible to do this via x amount of work\" vs \"Here, you can use this OSS&#x2F;selfhosted version which will do it for you.\" Do you legitimately not see the appeal of the latter to many people? reply berkes 46 minutes agorootparentI never said that I did not see the appeal. I&#x27;m not sure where you got that from.Au contraire: I&#x27;m building my business around that exact problem: that ledger is potentially good at doing anything, but doesn&#x27;t do it out of the box. reply tr3ntg 17 hours agoparentprevIf you&#x27;re using a tool like ledger, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much ghostfolio could say to convert you. Seems like comparing apples to oranges. I&#x27;m not familiar with ledger, but at a glance, seems like it&#x27;s made for a different audience with different needs. reply berkes 15 hours agorootparentIn fact, I&#x27;m working on something alike Ghostfolio but that uses ledger as database. It&#x27;s very much early stage and mostly proof of concept and hacked together scripts. But I&#x27;m moving it to both \"tabula\" and \"bullboard\":https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;berkes&#x2F;bullboard-rs https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;berkes&#x2F;tabulaAgain: early. But tabula is my consolidation of random \"beancount&#x2F;ledger\" stuff regarding running my small business and startup. And bullboard my consolidation of random \"beancount&#x2F;ledger\" stuff regarding everything investment related. The latter is just a CLI tool for now, and barely works. But once the businesslogic is done, I plan to add a web-interface alike ghostfolio to it. A tad simpler, I think, though. reply darau1 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s interesting. So, if I understand this thread at all, your projects may help me to \"preserve\" my \"wealth\", with ledger? reply berkes 32 minutes agorootparentIt won&#x27;t \"preserve\" it: if you sell or buy at the wrong time and place, it won&#x27;t prevent you. It&#x27;s basically a way to visualize your portfolio: hows it doing, what are your allocations, how well are you keeping your strategy? do you need to rebalance?Basically \"bullboard\" will be \"yet another portfolio tracker&#x2F;manager\". Like so many out there (Ghostfolio, PortfolioDividendTracker etc), nothing new.The only difference is that the source is your (existing) ledger&#x2F;beancount file.To be clear: it currently is a CLI application, but the goal is for it to be a web tool. Also selfhostable.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;redstreet&#x2F;fava_investor already exists in this space and is very similar: it&#x27;s what I currently use. I don&#x27;t like it, though. I dislike python for bookkeeping software and complex domain modelling. I dislike the UX of fava. And I prefer opinionated, focused software: call a spade a spade. Not \"Assets\", \"Income\" or \"Transactions\" but Stocks, ETFs, Bonds, Dividend, Sells, Buys etc. replyandix 17 hours agoprevI am using Portfolio Performance for a while now. Need to check how it compares.PP is easier to set up though, it&#x27;s a plain old Java desktop application.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.portfolio-performance.info&#x2F;en&#x2F;Edit: it works well for crypto too, you can track anything that has a count and a price. reply Aulig 12 hours agoparentI use that too. Ghostfolio looks a lot more beautiful but probably is more limited in terms of features :) reply ochoseis 16 hours agoprevTwo things I’ve learned after 15 years of working starting during the GFC:- It’s counterintuitive, but during your saving years you’re better off if the market’s doing poorly because everything’s on sale. If you’re retired you want the opposite.- Frequently looking at your net worth is a big distraction. Just focus on the things you can control, like your savings rate and expenses. reply wing-_-nuts 18 hours agoprevCall me old fashioned but I just add everything under &#x27;other accounts&#x27; on vanguard, and call it a day. It&#x27;s close enough for my taste. I imagine other brokerages offer this feature too and vanguard has pretty much the worst reputation for ux out there. reply systemvoltage 14 hours agoparentYeah, Schwab can track other accounts from Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.I’m probably a minority but I don’t micromanage my wealth. General account level information is good enough. I also do not trust wealth managers, usually their advice is terrible. Schwab automatically assigns a person on your account after a certain wealth threshold. They call me occasionally to make sure I’m aware of the risks which of course I am. reply mritchie712 14 hours agorootparentTheir advice isn&#x27;t necessarily terrible, it&#x27;s just strongly biased towards them making a buck off you. reply mushufasa 8 hours agorootparentIt used to be standard for advisors to make money on commission, which led to terrible incentives (read: they are paid to get you into particular investments, which is an incentive to recommend things that make them money even if they are bad for you). This practice is declining, but you still find it at the big banks and brokers. \"Fee only\" advisors means they only take a fee from you, so they don&#x27;t have this conflict of interest -- you can find many at Napfa.org .Even then, though, advisors are biased to recommend things that they can actually do for you, so sometimes they will recommend things that are easier for them (\"just use the same portfolio as my other clients\") instead of finding what&#x27;s truly optimal for you.And that&#x27;s actually usually okay. The kind of person who never touches their investments and doesn&#x27;t understand finance is actually better off with an advisor than doing literally nothing -- e.g. sitting in cash, or really dumb investments your aunt recommended -- which is the practically the counterfactual a lot of the time reply vba616 7 hours agorootparent>e.g. sitting in cashI read somewhere (but didn&#x27;t do my own research) Schwab&#x27;s business model these days, maybe others, is making money off idle customer cash, now that they don&#x27;t charge trading commissions. They may not want customers to buy anything.With interest rates up so much, I would guess it is even more lucrative? reply upon_drumhead 5 hours agorootparentWith VMRXX giving a YTD compound yield of 5.41% ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investor.vanguard.com&#x2F;investment-products&#x2F;mutual-fun... ), I&#x27;ve actually been happy to have parked a bunch of cash and not touched it. replymr-karan 18 hours agoprevLooks nice. The comparison with S&P500&#x2F;similar Index funds is an important metric to track. I’d also built a tool https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monkeybeat.market&#x2F; which demonstrates a similar concept.I’ve been exploring such projects off late myself. I found https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ananthakumaran&#x2F;paisa to be a really clean and well implemented project on similar lines. It already handles a bunch of asset classes familiar to the country I’m residing in which is tempting me to give it a shot sometime soon! reply jollyjerry 18 hours agoparentI like focusing on DIY-ers and having the web UI for visualizations. Makes sense that someone who would take the time to set things up would want increased flexibility over a spreadsheet. reply jmprspret 8 hours agoprevI never understand how these kinds of software do data importing. Do you have to manually import these things every time I do a trade or I get my paycheck or spend $2 at the corner shop? If so that seems annoying reply bboygravity 7 hours agoparentI just use a spreadsheet in Libre Calc that scrapes prices of securities (almost) live from public sources using an extension.All I need to do is keep track of whatever I transfer to my broker and number of securities purchased for each type of security.Works well enough for an investor. Does not work well enough for a gambler (day trader) :p reply gh02t 7 hours agoparentprevI use Firefly III (which isn&#x27;t quite the same but similar issue) and import csv exports from my bank and other accounts. I have to jump through some hoops with Selenium to automate downloading the csv files but it works mostly reliably after some fiddling. reply esprehn 8 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s bank data aggregators like Yodlee. If the app uses that it can auto import transactions. Ghostfolio seems to be oriented around manual import though (export csv from your bank and import yourself periodically). reply LoveMortuus 13 hours agoprevWhy did the site hijack the back button? I tried to return to HN but it just kept reloading into the ghostfol.io site... reply wintermutestwin 12 hours agoparentI am always baffled by people who actually use the back and forward buttons. I guess I just assume that everyone opens links by right-clicking and opening in a new tab. Is there some reason why back and forward is a better or even useful option? reply hsbauauvhabzb 11 hours agorootparentMobile devices, for one.The amount of websites that don’t support control+click indicate to me that most people don’t use the method.Edit: but regardless it’s not okay to hijack the back button. reply optymizer 8 hours agorootparentprevYou cannot possibly be serious.

Did I miss that? reply ak39 17 hours agoprevDoes it handle stock splits, consolidations, dividends etc? Calculating returns (basically tracking growth) is a non-trivial problem. reply berkes 15 hours agoparentYes, somewhat. Not as proper as it should. But it does the job. Esp with such events as splits, mergers, renames you can see it&#x27;s not a very professional setup. I&#x27;ve had to hack around it by adding and then nulling some assets like \"emission claims\". Or, in my country, dividend-tax is extracted immediately so I now hack around that by adding that tax as \"fee\" to ghostfolio. It works. But isn&#x27;t a replacement for actual book- and portfolio-keeping. reply FrameworkFred 17 hours agoprevNeat idea, but I don&#x27;t see a great way to handle real estate, unless it&#x27;s shoe-horned awkwardly into wealth items.

You get the source code, they provide you the service if you don&#x27;t want to handle it by your self. reply xcdzvyn 5 hours agorootparentI think GP means seeing a pricing section without any extra details suggests the open-source version is limited in some way, with certain features paywalled.

Yeah, right now we keep the API as open as possible, we’re big fans of oss but it’s gonna take a while as the system runs on many databases and systems. Apart from the simple portfolio tracking, we are ingesting live data from global stocks, thousands of news per day and do clustering and machine learning and all kinds of fancy things on it.I’d love to open source the dashboard first as it is probably useful to self-host and just feed with your own data.

I don&#x27;t even try and use it for keeping track of my finances, I use quicken for the simple reason that I know my spouse can use it as well. I didn&#x27;t see \"tax planning\" on the features for Ghostfolio, this seems so very basic to me that I couldn&#x27;t consider using it. I understand why in a way, there are so many situations.

UHNW have so many assets they need tailored help. And people with huge pain in debt don&#x27;t have much time, or lack the wherewithal to manage spreadsheets or analysis apps. reply jollyjerry 17 hours agorootparentYa the people I talked to that enjoyed tinkering were FIRE enthusiasts or bogleheads. But that felt more like entertainment and community rather than looking for a solution to a specific problem.I talked with small financial advisory firms (1-3 advisors) to see if there were some backend tools to help them with client work. There&#x27;s some initial data gathering and entry, but the value is the coaching and psychology rather than the hard numbers. reply mushufasa 16 hours agorootparentYes I think that is very true about advisory. In the retail space a lot of the value prop for an advisor seems similar to a personal trainer -- someone to keep you accountable. At the \"more money, more problems\" level, advisors actually do become busy executing specific tasks -- monitoring and trading multiple accounts, negotiation among family members, real estate agents, or PE firms... -- tech is empowering advisors to do more rather than replacing them. reply jollyjerry 16 hours agorootparentI like Arta&#x27;s pitch as a \"digital family office\" that handles more than just investments. Managing investments is still table stakes, but they also throw in estate planning and other offerings that a traditional financial advisor would offer.I tried Titan a while back and found that less compelling as a \"hedge fund &#x2F; active management roboadvisor\". It didn&#x27;t seem to differentiate sufficiently from the passive roboadvisors or what traditional wealth management could offer. reply buzer 15 hours agorootparentprevOne thing that I would like to see is tax impact analysis though this is naturally very country-specific.For example I would like to calculate the impact of wash sale or seeing the tax impact for selling from certain lot (in terms of short&#x2F;long term taxes).

It doesn&#x27;t imply that one should be wealthy (rich) to use this tool. Wealth management is a tool for planning your own personal wealth for the future.For example, you add all your accounts&#x2F;investments and have the software calculate how much you need to save so that by age 65 (retirement) you have $X which you will need so that by the time you reach life expectancy (say 90 y&#x2F;o) you have > 0$ left.There is other stuff you can add in, like \"I would like Y$ saved by 20XX so that I can purchase a house. How will that affect the amount I need to save now and how much will that affect my savings at retirement.\"> Or do they have meetings with their accountants, bankers, brokers.It is probably a good idea to have a financial advisor do this for you since they have the know-how (and certification depending where you live) and will know about regional benefits you can apply which can increase your \"wealth\". However, if you want to do this yourself because you know the space then there is software like this, or Wealth Simple for example. reply FrustratedMonky 15 hours agorootparentK.

There are places to hire professionals to assist, but until you are in the tens of millions or more in net worth it&#x27;s usually a better deal to self-manage because professionals expect a percentage of assets under management as a fee. Once you have a high enough net worth you operate a family office &#x2F; self-organized finance company and hire people directly.You don&#x27;t get wealthy by giving someone else 1% of AUM for performing on-par with a passive investment in index funds you could self-manage. So, sure, this is \"wanna be wealthy\", but what even is \"wealthy\"? I have a plan using spreadsheets and other tools that is on track to take me into low-mid double digit millions prior to retirement, I can&#x27;t imagine giving someone 1%, which can be six-figures or more, every year for clicking some buttons.

Empirically, as people make more money, they turn more to advisors and away from self-directed or robo apps.Lots of people have opined on why, if you follow the trade publications for advisors. To me, the reasoning comes down to risk: if you have a lot at stake then you will pay money for a lawyer to review for $$$$ per hour. If you have a lot of money you will pay 1% if you can feel more comfortable that the advisor is handling all the aspects of it and you can sleep better at night. reply xur17 18 hours agoparentprevWhat do you define as wealthy?

Wealth managers are usually the same products that are re-skinned for professional use with a few added features that most advisors should know how to do themselves...but usually don&#x27;t (I worked for someone managing nine figures who didn&#x27;t understand that you could use Excel to do calculations, so he would sit there with a calculator and hardcode every number...this man is worth $10m+ himself).If you have the ability, I appreciate that some people have neither the time or inclination, do it yourself. At medium levels of wealth (more than $1m and under $50m), you are likely unable to access good advice so this is really the sweet spot for doing it yourself (if you prefer simple financial products, financial advice largely exists as a service in this bracket because people choose to invest in extremely complex products that are designed to give financial advisors something to charge money for...if you have a DC pension and are investing in ETFs, 99% of financial advisors cannot do anything for you). reply Galanwe 12 hours agorootparent> At medium levels of wealth (more than $1m and under $50m), you are likely unable to access good adviceWhat the actual f...According to the \"Global Wealth Databook 2021\" by Credit Suisse, page 129, there are in the US:- $1-5M : 19.5M people ($1M (liquid) is enough to be denoted \"high net worth\" HNW and access private banking, with a dedicated wealth manager, from most major investment banks. reply Thorrez 5 hours agorootparent>$1-50M is _far_ from \"medium wealth\" by any stretch of the imagination.There are 2 ways to interpret \"at medium levels of wealth\":* A medium amount of money among the general population. This is the interpetation you&#x27;re thinking of.* A medium amount of money among wealthy people. So wealthy might mean $500k+, with the low end of wealthy meaning $500k-1M, and medium level of wealthy meaning $1M-5M. Below wealthy would be middle class. This may be the interpretation skippyboxedhero was thinking of. reply skippyboxedhero 10 hours agorootparentprevIt isn&#x27;t. Maybe Morgan Stanley do $1m liquid, but they are aimed at the general public. The big investment banks usually start somewhere around $5-10m, and to actually get good advice you need to be somewhere above this level. reply ebiester 16 hours agorootparentprevSo, then, who are the right people for the kind of financial questions that require experience but don&#x27;t need an ongoing relationship? (For example, someone who has an existing IRA but would like to convert it as to later take advantage of backdoor Roth conversions - it&#x27;s a complex modeling exercise that&#x27;s probably simple for an expert but hard to get right for someone who will need to do it precisely once in their life. reply skippyboxedhero 10 hours agorootparentThat is the problem. Everyone wants single-time advice but it isn&#x27;t possible to actually distribute that product profitably in the current structure of the market.Regulatory costs are very high, this means insurance costs are high, etc. Marketing costs are extremely high in financial services too. If you are going mass market, you are paying hundreds of dollars for leads...how do you make that work if you can&#x27;t charge much and need to acquire your whole customer base every week?This is why most of the market is underserved, why rich people end up owning all the high-yield assets, and why the only real solution is having very large institutional pools of capital for most retail savings (i.e. like Australia&#x27;s superannuation funds, which produced a level of wealth for the average consumer vastly in excess of the US with lower levels of GDP per capita, relatively poor penetration of financial markets, etc.). reply toolz 13 hours agorootparentprevFor me personally, half the benefit of handling your finances correctly is that with the knowledge of one thing often comes learning about something else that might tweak your financial strategy or at the very least increase your options in life. For something like a backdoor roth strategy or when it might make sense to utilize isn&#x27;t something I personally would want handled for me. I would want to understand the decisions I make and potentially learn something important along the way.Financial literacy doesn&#x27;t seem optional for the wealthy from my perspective.

This page targets ISO 8601-1:2019. Previous editions and drafts contain key differences. ISO 8601-2:2019 contains additional representations including sub-year groupings (e.g. for seasons); grouped units; sets; uncertainty qualifications; and date arithmetic. These are not yet represented on this page. RFC 3339 suggests other characters could be specified to replace the T in downstream standards but only gives a space character as an example. RFC 3339 is case-insensitive so every T or Z could also be t or z respectively. Previous editions of ISO 8601 were also case-insensitive. ISO 8601 allows decimal fractions of the smallest time value. These are mostly represented here by a single fractional digit but the standard allows arbitrary precision. ISO 8601 allows commas and dots for decimal separation but they are interchangeable in all formats. ISO 8601 uses a hyphen character (in Unicode, U+2010 HYPHEN \"‐\") and minus character (in Unicode, U+2212 MINUS \"−\"). When using character sets which don't have these characters a hyphen-minus character (in Unicode, U+2D HYPHEN-MINUS \"-\") should be used instead. The formatter defaults to using hyphen-minus which is valid under both standards. ISO 8601-1:2019 permits omitting the T in the time of day representations (Times) when unambiguous. However, a T is always required in date and time of day representations (Date-Times). Previous editions also allowed omitting the T in Date-Times but it was never permitted to insert alternative characters (e.g. space or underscore). Each standard defines multiple formats for different purposes. Other formats are therefore discouraged. The format key is given below the table.

But it&#x27;s possible that between now and 2030 they might adopt Central European (Summer) Time[1], or retry British Double Summer Time[2], or scrap daylight savings entirely. Therefore, what happens to 6pm with respect to any given epoch might vary wildly between now and 2030.But it would be nice to set a calendar event for \"6pm London time\", whatever London time happens to be when the event rolls around. But there&#x27;s no standardised interoperable way to say \"2030-07-01 18:00:00 Europe&#x2F;London\".[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;British_Summer_Time[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Central_European_Time[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;British_Summer_Time#Periods_of... reply LegionMammal978 15 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s currently a draft document for such a format [0], called IXDTF (the Internet Extended Date&#x2F;Time Format). It allows you to specify a timezone (as a tz name) in brackets following an RFC 3339 string. To give a local time, you have to specify your best estimate of the UTC offset alongside the bracketed timezone. For instance, \"2030-07-01 18:00:00 Europe&#x2F;London\" would be \"2030-07-01T18:00:00+01:00[Europe&#x2F;London]\".If the UK changes its rules before that time, then the timestamp becomes \"inconsistent\" (see section 3.4). The behavior on an inconsistent timestamp is left for the application to decide, but if a ! character is included within the brackets before the timezone name, then it&#x27;s at least obligated to detect the problem instead of blindly following the UTC offset:> In case of inconsistent time-offset and time zone suffix, if the critical flag is used on the time zone suffix, an application MUST act on the inconsistency. If the critical flag is not used, it MAY act on the inconsistency. Acting on the inconsistency may involve rejecting the timestamp, or resolving the inconsistency via additional information such as user input and&#x2F;or programmed behavior.This extended timestamp format is used in the proposed Temporal library for JavaScript [1] (though I&#x27;m not sure if it supports the ! character). The ZonedDateTime.from() parsing function [2] takes an optional \"offset\" parameter to allow the user to control which part of an inconsistent timestamp takes precedence. It also supports simply omitting the UTC offset and using only the timezone, but it warns that this is ambiguous for times in the repeated hour during a DST transition.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;id&#x2F;draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-e...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tc39.es&#x2F;proposal-temporal&#x2F;docs&#x2F;strings.html#iana-tim...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tc39.es&#x2F;proposal-temporal&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ambiguity.html#ambigu... reply seabass-labrax 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an excellent idea, and one which I should hope to implement in my calendaring software if it is accepted.

(Ignore updates, I mean the time I said. E.G. The doors open at 8am every day.)An indicated end of a duration, such as the period of time a mass of decaying radio-isotopes are valid for the sensor during? (Offhand, no consumer equipment comes to mind, but for an extremely sensitive calibrated sample it could matter and this is a contrived example.) Exact moment in monotonic time. (What about stretchy leap seconds too?)Something between the two extremes?Most humans probably want a default of something like...\"Looser more common use time unless I get more specific.\" So if a TZ is included, it isn&#x27;t a fixed moment, but whatever specifier is the valid moment as that moment passes. Convert it to an absolute monotonic value at that time to record the event and not just the specification of when to capture the event&#x27;s passing.E.G. Unix time Epoch was 1970-01-01 00:00:00~Z with an absolute reference value of 0s DATE RoundedHour~US.EST => Actually is EDT but most people don&#x27;t use that notation, and congress changed when DST happens yet again without abolishing it too, and this happened last year before the change but the event did run from Noon to 9PM with these event moment second values... reply klabb3 10 hours agorootparent> The issue is, what do you mean?It would simply mean the time which is intended. It’s true that the instant isn’t known until it happens (or however much leeway precedes a TZ change). It’s generally always better to record intent, than to be smart and translate inputs to something else.To map to a specific instant in UTC time, you use the string plus a db. The db can change in the future, and that’s ok. You simply update in the presentation layer in case you have any “2h left” strings or calendar entries. Note you should NOT store the mapped instance in a db before the event has occurred (and even then it’s unnecessary since it’s fixed).I really don’t like the “inconsistent” mutable property and agree with parent that offset should not be part of the format. That would make it extremely easy to overlook or misuse.Perhaps I’m missing something? reply efitz 6 hours agorootparent> Perhaps I’m missing something?Yes, you’re missing something - geography. “Local time” doesn’t include a frame of reference. If you want to have a meaningful representation of local time you need syntax to specify where, probably Lat&#x2F;Long.Then, periodically, the computer can look up the lat&#x2F;long to see what the rules are there for time, and compare vs the target time.But even THAT doesn’t solve the problem, because you probably don’t want the computer in a tight loop of looking up location rules for time and checking time. But if you do it periodically then there is a nonzero chance that you will miss the event because the rules changed since the last check and the current check happened after the event.And you can’t just use the city names for time zones (e.g. “Europe&#x2F;London”) because only a very small number of places have such names, and because they really refer to a combination of time zone and DST rules, not to a city, they just choose representative cities.Finally, ISO 8601 does support durations, which RFC 3339 does not, so ISO seems more useful in that regard, but durations are not relative to any epoch. reply mjevans 9 hours agorootparentprevI agree on not including the offset.However I&#x27;m saying that the solution should be radically different and much more user focused.There is a difference between a description of when to capture a moment (which should favor the way the normal person describes moments) and an absolute moment event. replyjbandela1 16 hours agoparentprevI think you want it more specific than a timezone.For example, instead of London, suppose you wanted to meet in Glasgow, Scotland, on July 1st 2030, at 6pm local time.Currently, Glasgow in is timezone Europe&#x2F;London.However, it is not unimaginable that in that time, Scotland could hold another referendum on independence and either join Central European Time, or create Scottish Standard Time. reply layer8 15 hours agorootparentThe problem is that we don’t know what the timezone identifiers for hypothetical future timezones will be. Meaning, there would be no automated way to associate those future-date-time values with the correct timezone once the new timezone is added to the tz database.One could imagine using geo coordinates or similar, but the mapping from those to timezones (or from&#x2F;to zip codes or area codes) is already not precisely defined.If you use city names, those might also be split&#x2F;merged (Berlin) or renamed (Constantinopel). reply chaz6 14 hours agorootparentIf you use coordinates, make sure to take into account continental drift. You could use a plate-local coordinate system (e.g. British National Grid for Great Britain) so you only need to take into account deformation.There is actually a good read on this at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;is-britain-on-the-move reply crooked-v 12 hours agorootparentWhat about storing current geo coordinates and a timestamp of when they were recorded? I feel like that should be enough for a theoretical future system to adjust mapping for continental drift. reply ethbr1 7 hours agorootparentThe problem with geo coordinates is reverse mapping them back into political owners, so you can then determine current timezone policy.There&#x27;s 4 things at play here: - Coordinate location on the planet - Identifier for that location - Political entity for that location - Current timezone policyOf those, coordinates are the only thing that doesn&#x27;t change over time (for the spans we&#x27;re talking about).But are also a pain in the ass to use. F.ex.

You don&#x27;t need to guess at the probability of future published rules, but you do want to have sufficient information to reevaluate the published rules.This is why storing UTC dates for future events is insufficient: if the event is actually specified in local time, the date is incorrect when the time zone rules are changed. But storing the time zone is insufficient if the time zone that applies to the event also changes; you also need to store enough information to reevaluate which time zone is applicable.Of course, it can be difficult to gather this information in a user friendly way, so you know, compromises. reply codetrotter 16 hours agorootparentprevStore the gps coordinates of the location for the meeting instead, along with the desired local time and local date. reply isbvhodnvemrwvn 12 hours agorootparentThis limits your meetings to surface of earth, what if I want to meet with you on Mars? reply dotancohen 54 minutes agorootparentEven on the surface of the Earth there could be ambiguity.

The best way to do it would be to say \"X seconds from the time this message was sent\" reply avianlyric 15 hours agorootparent> 6PM local time could mean Zulu+6 or Zulu+3 or anything else if local timezone offset changes via legislation.That’s the point. Normal people think about time based on their local time. If they agree to meet someone at 3pm on a day in the future, that normally means turning up on that day when a local clock on that day reads 3pm. If local time changes offset from UTC, then the meeting implicitly also changes.I’ve personally yet to meet someone that reschedules all their appointments every time day light saving (or the inverse) rolls around. Just make sure their appointment times in UTC don’t change. reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentprev+6 or +3 is irrelevant to the scheduler when they&#x27;re setting the meeting time: they want it to be 6pm regardless of any time zone changes in the future. So they deliberately do not store the UTC offset with that time. They only store the geographic location.Then when the meeting time is approaching, the software can figure out what time zone (and UTC offset) applies, after taking account any time zone changes that have taken place in the intervening years, and appropriately set reminder notifications.If they were to store \"X seconds from the time this message was sent\", then any time zone change would likely make it not fall at 6pm on the target day, so that&#x27;s not what they&#x27;d want. reply noselasd 14 hours agorootparentprev\"X seconds from the time this message was sent\" would certainly not hit 6PM local time if the local timezone offset changed - unless you also update X every time it does. reply wrs 15 hours agorootparentprevThe point is that the local time would not change, even though the offset between UTC and local did change. reply scbrg 13 hours agorootparentAs long as the invited people don&#x27;t change nationality...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.972mag.com&#x2F;the-worlds-only-ethnic-time-zone&#x2F;If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about time keeping, it&#x27;s that whenever you think you&#x27;ve got it all figured out, there&#x27;s always one more corner case. reply jvanderbot 15 hours agorootparentprevI see.The problem is there is no difference between local time and \"offset from UTC\", right? reply codetrotter 15 hours agorootparent> there is no difference between local time and \"offset from UTC\"The difference is between applying the UTC offset for a future event using present rules. What we are saying is you should not do that because the rules can change.I ask you today that we meet at 3PM on January 24th in 2026, at the train station in Berlin.In my paper calendar book for I mark the date January 24th 2026 with the following note: “meet jvanderbot at 3PM at the train station in Berlin”.I carry this book with me for the next few years.Meanwhile, you decide to be modern so you store a note about the meeting in a database. In doing so, you convert the information into a UTC offset for that future time. But you are using current rules for today, which may change.And then when the day arrives, there has been political changes in the meantime that made it so that the utc offset is different.Because you converted to utc offset ahead of time, your representation of the time no longer maps to “3 PM” but instead to let’s say “4 PM”.I show up at 3 PM local time, as we had agreed. But you are nowhere to be seen because in your digital calendar the meeting appears to be for “4 PM”.This is what we mean when we are talking about the problem with converting a local time to a UTC offset a long time ahead. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentprevLocal time has no notion of a UTC offset. Local time is just \"9am on August 31, 2024\". It&#x27;s up to the application&#x27;s implementation details to pair it with a physical location (e.g. some lat&#x2F;long in London). The app would then have to (as the event date approaches) resolve that into something more computer-clock-understandable; that is, it would have to say \"this lat&#x2F;long is located in timezone XYZ, which has offset ### for that date\", so it could tell the OS&#x27;s notification service to pop up reminders at the appropriate times. reply stouset 15 hours agorootparentprevThat seems to be in line with what GP wants. reply jvanderbot 15 hours agorootparentI see. I misunderstood! replydeathanatos 15 hours agoparentprev> But it would be nice to set a calendar event for \"6pm London time\", whatever London time happens to be when the event rolls around. But there&#x27;s no standardised interoperable way to say \"2030-07-01 18:00:00 Europe&#x2F;London\".The only gotcha about such a thing is that there are ambiguous or impossible timestamps: 2023-11-05 01:30:00 America&#x2F;New_York — that&#x27;s one of two different times.For calendaring, it would make sense, since \"same wall clock time regardless\" is what most people want¹; there might be some UI difficulty&#x2F;challenges to handle the weird times, and maybe one might want to have a way to specify a disambiguation in the syntax.Thankfully for calendaring those are usually in the middle of the night, but I&#x27;ve literally seen this happen in my career.¹though once you invite the first person in a zone that doesn&#x27;t do DST madness, note that this causes the calendar time to wobble on their calendars.

The website time.is is very useful for this.This takes a bit more effort, but it is less ambiguous and saves you from having to deal with the insanity that is time.

See the footnote.I know it works both ways, too, but probably would be better for the DST observing zone to deal with the effects of DST, instead of foisting such side effects onto our international friends. reply wahern 14 hours agorootparentprevIn the OP&#x27;s example, 2023-11-05 01:30:00 America&#x2F;New_York, 1:30AM occurs twice as at 2:00AM the clock rolls back to 1:00AM. Normally this is resolved by including a disambiguating timezone, EDT (first 1:30AM) or EST (second 1:30AM). But if there&#x27;s no timezone indication to accompany a geographical location, there&#x27;s no way to disambiguate the time. reply deathanatos 14 hours agorootparentIf there&#x27;s no flag indicating DST. America&#x2F;New_York is the timezone designation.Part of what makes TZ discussions incredibly difficult is that people play fast and loose with the terminology.I think the person you&#x27;re responding to is simply saying that if you made the meeting in a non-DST observing zone, the meeting time would still wobble in a DST-observing zone. (I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re noting it, because my comment also clearly spells that out, too, albeit in reverse. But yes, it works both ways.) reply jameshart 12 hours agorootparentprevRight, to pick an actual time stamp for a particular local time in a particular location, you need to first choose at what time stamp to resolve the time offset for the location. Then in that time offset you can unambiguously map the localtime to a unique time stamp. reply jiehong 16 hours agoparentprevIn the calendar world (iCal), this is actually supported: a date time without a time zone is a local time only [0].[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc5545#section-3.3.5 reply fanf2 14 hours agorootparentAs well as what wrs said in a sibling comment, iCalendar does not have a way to specify the location of a meeting in a machine-readable way that can be turned into the timezone for that location.Sadly, iCalendar is very much tied to using timezones for locations. I expect that if&#x2F;when Europe finally gets round to abolishing DST, there will be some significant changes to the timezone boundaries, and as a consequence, much hilarious calendaring failure. Dunno if it will affect as many people as the 2007 DST changes in North America, which caused a lot of extra work for people running Microsoft Exchange, because it was designed assuming that timezones never change. And this design error carries over to iCalendar, tho (apart from tz boundary changes) it is better than it was. reply codetrotter 16 hours agorootparentprevYup. Similarly with the time zone aware Rust crate “chrono” you also have datetime representations for local time called “naive” datetime to store date time without time zone.And likewise in PostgreSQL you can store timestamp without time zone.Combine that representation with lat&#x2F;long gps coordinates and you have what you need for scheduling future events at specific locations regardless of changes in time zone names and offsets. reply wrs 15 hours agorootparentprevNot quite — that requires you to find the time zone locality out of band somehow. The request is to have a standard way to store the time zone (not the current offset of the time zone) in the same string as the date&#x2F;time. reply Karellen 15 hours agorootparentprevBut if I send that to someone who is in a different timezone, e.g. in America&#x2F;New_York, will it put the event at 6pm London Time in their calendar, so that they can videocall in at whatever time that is where they are? reply michaelt 14 hours agorootparentThe ical format allows dates like DTSTART;TZID=Europe&#x2F;London:20230901T201000Whether your calendar software will let you choose how it expresses the timezone and whether the recipient&#x27;s calendar software will store it that way is another question... reply nightpool 13 hours agorootparentGoogle Calendar does, at least. It even supports representing events that being and end in different timezones (like a plane flight or a cross country trip) reply zaxomi 3 hours agoparentprevA problem with the future is that it is hard to predict.Define whatever format you want, and there&#x27;s always the possibility of a politician changing what the local time is.Historically, the offset against UTC has changed by a few minutes, hours, or days. Is daylight savings used? When? It is not even certain that it is the same calendar that is used, or that there are 24 hours per day, when the day starts, which months there are, or which month is the first of the year.If the time zone changes in the future, so that the specified local time no longer corresponds to the same time in UTC, then the time of the event has changed, even if the organizer still specifies 6 pm. reply HelloNurse 3 hours agorootparentChanging the time of the event is the whole point: specifying the yet undetermined time that would be called 6pm according to the currently unknown timezone and DST offset on that day in the future, not a specific time that we don&#x27;t know what will be called in the future. reply kybernetikos 2 hours agoparentprevOne idea I experimented with for this was to use airport codes. Airports are the approximate correct frequency (the kinds of political entities that might make decisions about timezones usually have an airport), quite recognisable to people familiar with the relevant area and have an established short code and canonical list.There are disadvantages too of course, one of which is overlap between airport codes and currently existing timezone codes. This led me to discover a couple of airports that have the same code as their timezone. reply danbruc 15 hours agoparentprevYou want three pieces of information, a date, a location and a local time. Note that I do not think you actually want a time zone, what if you are not in London and that place gets moved into another timezone?All our common date time formats are intended to represent a specific point in time and this you just do not have in your case. But it is actually not too uncommon that date and time specifications have a non-trivial structure, think a meeting on every last Friday of the month or a monthly meeting series starting on January 31st or two days before the end of each quarter.I would guess trying to come up with a standard that covers all the things people could come up with, would become quite complex quickly. So if simple dates, times or instants are not good enough, you are probably on your own, make some structure with all the required things. reply codeflo 7 hours agorootparent> You want three pieces of information, a date, a location and a local time.

And going one step back, who really has to schedule things to a specific time so far into the future that uncertainty about time zone changes become a valid concern? There are certainly things like a space probe arriving at Pluto in a couple of years, but in such cases you will not care about the local time in London.

You can&#x27;t guarantee ahead of time when it will be, but it matters to people.When I worked on a system that provided schedules for appointments, it was quite difficult to furnish a link that put this on someone&#x27;s calendar reliably, and to set up reminders that went out every third Monday of the month at 9am to remind people to go to their clinic appt at 11am. People are equally annoyed at 8am or 10am reminders in such a case, so you can&#x27;t tie it to a specific time, and daylight savings time gets changed from time to time, and various locations have \"9am\" at different times. We didn&#x27;t even get into the weeds of whether someone who lives in Phenix City, AL should get notices in Central or Eastern (it&#x27;s Eastern for most people, except if they work for the government or are going to school... unless it&#x27;s a private school, which might still be on Eastern...).Telling someone they can get their notice at any time they want as long as it&#x27;s specified in UTC year round just doesn&#x27;t solve the problem they have. reply sublinear 9 hours agorootparentOops you&#x27;re right.

But wow, you are actually correct! I don&#x27;t have a copy for ISO 8601-1:2019, but 8601-1:2016 [1] has the following note in the section 4.3.2 Complete representations:> By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, the character [T] may be omitted in applications where there is no risk of confusing a date and time of day representation with others defined in this International Standard.I thought this allows a replacement of [T] with a space, but it doesn&#x27;t state so! It just means that the time designator can be omitted, e.g. 2023-09-0117:12:30 instead of 2023-09-01T17:12:30. It does look very strange (especially when used with extended formats) and I&#x27;m not sure if it was actually intended or not as there is no accompanying example, but nevertheless the 2016 spec doesn&#x27;t allow a space. Oops.EDIT: It indeed seems that ISO 8601-1:2019 no longer has this note. I now agree that this is a bad move. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9532375[1] Specifically the Draft International Standard that was once available from loc.gov. reply ijmacd 1 hour agorootparent\"8601-1:2016\" is not a thing.

ISO 8601:2004 (the most recent version before ISO 8601-1:2019) states in § 4.3.2:> NOTE By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, the character [T] may be omitted in applications where there is no risk of confusing a date and time of day representation with others defined in this International Standard.This was removed with the 2019 version. However there is another section in the latest version which some people get caught out by. ISO 8601-1:2019 § 5.3.5 states:> In time-only expressions, UTC of day expressions and time of day with time shift expressions, the time designator [“T”] may be omitted in the representations defined in 5.3 only when there is no risk of confusion.This only refers to Time expressions (not DateTime) and says that both \"T16:40\" and \"16:40\" are valid time representations. reply Zuiii 5 hours agoparentprev> It&#x27;s \"funny\" how both RFC 3339 and ISO 8601 standards include a huge number of redundant DT formats with often overlapping purposes, yet \"2023-09-01 15:30:59\", which is by far most used DT format (because it&#x27;s fucking obvious!) across all systems is included in neither.It&#x27;s much readable too.

Because it&#x27;s less readable, and it&#x27;s not arguable.> And I have no idea why they sacrificed the universality of the format by limiting the year segment to only four digitsNo, there are reasons. People often represent year with 2 digits, so forcing you to use 4 digits is basically intended to make representing 20 CE unambiguous as 0020-01-01 (as opposed to 20-01-01). But, I mean, it&#x27;s a problem to be mindful of when making a standard, not an insurmountable obstacle. A real standard to end other formats once and for all just needs to make sure to take care of all corner-cases. The truth is RFC 3339 and ISO 8601 are just shitty standards.(Edit: Also, just in case, note that it is possible to use 5 or more digits in ISO 8601. But the standard says that the parties must agree beforehand on that. That&#x27;s what I mean by \"unclear\". I cannot just say that you MUST represent DT in ISO-XXXX format, it&#x27;s not specific enough. In the end we must to agree on how our systems will behave when receiving this or that value anyway, so it makes having an external \"standard\" pretty pointless, since the standard is pretty clear about very obvious situations, and very hand-wavy in all actually non-trivial situations.) reply lifthrasiir 3 hours agorootparent> People often represent year with 2 digits [...]Ambiguously.

Then I&#x27;ll parse it as if ISO 8601 date and time format with the `T` omission is allowed (because it essentially is). Done. I wouldn&#x27;t ever try to figure out the meaning of, say, `23-09-01 12:34:56` because they are ambiguous and should have been discouraged after all (or more practically, allow a free-form format but give the guessed normalized date and time in ISO 8601 immediately so that it can be checked). reply krick 2 hours agorootparent> Laypersons have no idea what the heck is ISO 8601 anywayDamn, that&#x27;s a great point for sure. Then what&#x27;s the point of having a standard if \"nobody has any idea\" what it is and and you are supposed to define all the details of the format with all corner-cases in a private conversation anyway?!That&#x27;s right, there&#x27;s none. The whole point of having a standard is that I can say that the value is \"ISO 3166-1 alpha-2\" country code, and you know that you MUST recognize all officially assigned values (or you don&#x27;t really implement the protocol) AND that you&#x27;ll never receive, say YY, unless ISO assigns it a value (or it would mean I violate the protocol). Now, just to be clear: this standard is also not as well-defined, as I&#x27;d like it to be — since some values can be user-assigned, and in effect 2 different implementations of \"ISO 3166-1 alpha-2\" can be incompatible. And I don&#x27;t really see the point of referring to a changing standard without specifying a version. But it&#x27;s as good as it gets here, and is totally enough for 99% of cases where you&#x27;d need country codes.ISO 8601 is way worse, since it doesn&#x27;t unambiguously cover even relatively basic use-cases of how people use dates, and in effect we have lots of \"somewhat ISO 8601\" protocol implementations that are incompatible, and it cannot be clearly communicated what is the actual scope of your implementation by linking a sub-standard, and in the end you have to \"just say\": use the format \"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\", padded with enough (what does \"enough\" mean, by the way? no clue) zeros. I.e., you have to not to refer to any standard at all. And given ISO 8601 is also clumsy as hell, most people prefer to use home-baked format anyway. reply lifthrasiir 2 hours agorootparent> Then what&#x27;s the point of having a standard if \"nobody has any idea\" what it is and and you are supposed to define all the details of the format with all corner-cases in a private conversation anyway?!Because they are often building blocks for other standards, not necessarily to be used directly.For example there is an ISO standard called ISO&#x2F;IEC 5218, \"codes for the representation of human sexes\", and it is simply 1 for male, 2 for female, 0 for not known and 9 for not applicable. So should the male called the sex 1? Not at all. It exists because many existing databases used such values for sexes (or genders, whatever they are). If you are not benefitting from using ISO&#x2F;IEC 5218 and there is no associated legal requirement then you have no obligation to use it. Same for ISO 8601 and pretty much every standard.If you want to create a forgiving enough date and time format that aims to be adopted as much as possible, go ahead, but ISO 8601 doesn&#x27;t have to do that.> [...] in the end you have to \"just say\": use the format \"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\", padded with enough (what does \"enough\" mean, by the way? no clue) zeros.You are correctly guessed that this description is not for everyone :-) (For example, I haven&#x27;t said that it uses the Gregorian calendar.) ISO 8601 does cover that. But not everyone has to fully understand ISO 8601 to write an ISO 8601 date and time---we can just tell a (typically small) difference between the \"common\" format and ISO 8601.> [...] in effect we have lots of \"somewhat ISO 8601\" protocol implementations that are incompatible, and it cannot be clearly communicated what is the actual scope of your implementation by linking a sub-standard, [...]\"ISO 8601 date and time format with the `T` omission is allowed\" is a concise and complete description and not \"somewhat ISO 8601\". The standard explicitly says that parties can choose to pick this extension, meaning that the standard itself works well whether the extension is used or not and other defined extensions won&#x27;t collide with it. This is different from something like \"the format yyyy-mm-dd\" for the reasons I&#x27;ve detailed above; it is okay as an explainer, but not enough as a specification.I do think though that ISO 8601 will benefit from explicit labels for those extensions. reply krick 1 hour agorootparent> ISO&#x2F;IEC 5218Look… How often are you referred to ISO&#x2F;IEC 5218 standard, honestly? Me — it very well might be that you&#x27;re my first. But it&#x27;s nice it&#x27;s there. If it wasn&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t be very sad, because M&#x2F;F&#x2F;None was probably enough for me so far (and is actually way more permissive than most of actual protocols where I had to specify human sex, which usually allow just M&#x2F;F).ISO 8601 on the other hand… First off, datetimes are everywhere, and are used constantly. Second, datetimes are far less trivial, and it actually requires some good amount of thinking to come up with a good representation. It is even more complicated to communicate that specification in all of the details. So, forget about whether ISO 8601 exists or not — the fact is, that I need a datetime standard. I need it every day, many times a day. Everyone needs it. Everyone comes up with his own shitty standard at least a couple of times during his life. Nobody can really communicate his own shitty standard unambiguously, covering even most popular corner cases, because only very rare people actually thought about the problem half as much, as it has to be thinked about to come up with something remotely good. And since pretty much everyone even acquainted with a notion of \"standard\" regards ISO as the \"standards organization\" we end up referring each other to ISO 8601 often enough that I know what one is talking about without actually googling the code. Technical people almost consider it a virtue of not coming up with their own standard, if there already is a usable one (and for a good reason). Long way short: ISO 8601 is important. Way more important than ISO&#x2F;IEC 5218 or some meme tea-making manual. And it doesn&#x27;t live up to what is (and, my point — should be) expected of it.The range of what HTML allows is far more used in practice, in my experience. Which is kinda sad, because \"HTML date format\" isn&#x27;t really format I should be referring to, ever, it&#x27;s ambiguous, it&#x27;s not commonly recognized, and it doesn&#x27;t even account for a number of very important use cases ISO 8601 accounts for (date ranges, for one).Now, I&#x27;m not sure which part of your post would I quote, but basically you are missing my point in the whole second half of your post. You are spending a lot of time talking about \"T vs space\" (which, unfortunately, might require that much time talking about and more), while this is really the trivial thing, everyone would get on the go, since it&#x27;s so commonly used. So, because it&#x27;s so intuitive, it&#x27;s the part of the problem that begs about being standardized the least. What really begs for a standard are all these less obvious situations: 2-digit years, years before 1582, years BC, years after 9999 — which, unfortunately, are really not that uncommon. Honestly, they are common, even.And while — as I said from the very beginning — ISO 8601 does make some half-assed attempts to address all these issues, in practice it doesn&#x27;t communicate any of possible scopes of values clearly enough. In effect, there are lots of applications, that pretend that they \"parse ISO 8601 datetimes\", yet you&#x27;ll find out that, say, Python standard library just doesn&#x27;t handle negative dates at all. Which is ok (I mean, bad, but understandable), but the problem is that you really have to think about it yourself to even find it out. And the big value proposition of having a standard is exactly that you don&#x27;t have to think about all the details, you just rely on the fact that Wikipedia (a big, reputable project) claims that it uses standard X for the datetimes, and Python (a big, reputable project) claims that it&#x27;s standard library function can parse standard X datetimes, and you just assume that someone did all the thinking for you already and they are compatible. And ideally there should be standard Y such that it makes it trivial to refer to X = Y-1 and X = Y-2 and see that they are, in fact, incompatible.So in practice ISO 8601 just doesn&#x27;t do what it should. reply Narushia 2 hours agorootparentprev> I sure as hell cannot force them to use \"2023-09-20T20:30:59\" instead of \"2023-09-20 20:30:59\".

If you want more than a basic type you give it structure - and durations are not trivial types nor common enough to deserve their own representation.Durations optimized for storage without ambiguity would be the tuple (u64, u32, u8) where the first value is seconds, second value is nanoseconds (if precision is needed) and final value is epoch.Durations displayed to a user wouldn&#x27;t ever be stored so the point is kind of moot.Optimizing for \"time it takes someone to write it once\" is kind of dumb since it happens once while reading it happens often, and parsing even more likely. reply mort96 2 hours agorootparentThe ISO format can be used for a lot of things which your JSON format could never be used for.

If I&#x27;m using a static language, it is common for me to have a TimeSpan (or similar) type and standard rules for how it can be serialized (e.g. toString, toJson, etc). In this scenario, I don&#x27;t care how it is represented in JSON, I just want convenient (de)serialization.With your example, I would need to create custom parsing logic, and handle a dynamic number of JSON fields. But if a TimeSpan class had JSON deserialization built in based on the ISO8601 format, then I wouldn&#x27;t need to do anything special. That&#x27;s the benefit of using the standards. Same if I wanted to convert the JSON stringified format into a postgres time span there isn&#x27;t any special parsing logic I need to do.Yes, it&#x27;s just a string in JSON, so it&#x27;s not semantically special. But other languages that have a TimeSpan type could take advantage of the standard serialized format.Here is an example of what it could look like in F#, no special logic for deserializing into a custom type: type MyEvent = { myDuration: TimeSpan; createdAt: DateTimeOffset; eventId: string; } let rawJson = \"\"\" { \"myDuration\":\"P15DT5H0M20S\", \"createdAt\": \"2023-08-24T20:30:00Z\", \"eventId\": \"e_1234\" } \"\"\" let myEvent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize(json = rawJson) reply duped 9 hours agorootparentI see your point, but I guess I don&#x27;t see the difference between it being structured as a string with a second deserialization step after JSON deserialization. I see the convenience of a standard way to deserialize the time stamp.But either way you need multiple pieces of data for the duration to be correct and useful. Without the created-at time in your example the duration will be invalid in the presence of leap years&#x2F;seconds.If you want to unambiguously encode a duration of time, it needs to be in the smallest unambiguous unit that is meaningful (usually seconds&#x2F;nano seconds). That will allow your duration to be correctly used without any additional logic&#x2F;metadata packed along with it. reply NikkiA 14 hours agoprev6 digit years seem like a solution to a problem that will never be for the sake of looking forward thinking.

And it&#x27;s worse for private systems that can just tell the clients to keep it inside the generic formats.In that sense, ISO 8601 or RFC 3339 are virtually the same for many systems&#x2F;companies. reply ijmacd 5 hours agoparentprev1) There&#x27;s nothing special about 6 digit years.

Is RFC 3339 well used&#x2F;adopted in any system?ISO 8601 was first published in 1988. RFC 3339, while ostensibly dated July 2002, codifies practices that date back to Usenet and e-mail (RFC 822: August 1982), and perhaps to the date utility (which existed in Version 1 AT&T UNIX). reply pdw 15 hours agorootparentNah, email and classic Unix use entirely unrelated date formats. The RFC 822 format looks like \"Thu, 31 Aug 2023 20:53:11\". Unix &#x2F; ctime(3) uses \"Thu Aug 31 20:56:52 2023\". reply robobro 13 hours agorootparentRFC 822 is what RSS feeds use and RFC 3339 is what Atom feeds use.I don&#x27;t know about you, but I think RFC 3339 dates are much more appealing :) reply jmull 16 hours agoprevWhat a great visualization for this.I&#x27;d prefer to use space (or underscore) instead of T to separate the date and time parts, but generally stick with T to avoid problems with anything that can only handle ISO 8601 (and to be consistent). reply cryptonector 11 hours agoparentI prefer T because nothing will be splitting these strings on T by accident. reply lifthrasiir 6 hours agoprev> ISO 8601 uses a hyphen character (in Unicode, U+2010 HYPHEN \"‐\") and minus character (in Unicode, U+2212 MINUS \"−\"). When using character sets which don&#x27;t have these characters a hyphen-minus character (in Unicode, U+2D HYPHEN-MINUS \"-\") should be used instead.This is incorrect. What ISO 8601 actually specifies is that, if the target character set is based on ISO&#x2F;IEC 646 (which definitely includes Unicode), then a hyphen-minus character should be used for both cases. There is a slight ambiguity here (e.g. what if some charset contains most but not all characters in 646?) but in the case of Unicode the interpretation is clear. I believe this is a roundabout way to specify the canonical mapping for 646 and guarantee the compatibility with other charsets based on 646. reply ijmacd 5 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s very interesting.The relevant paragraph from the standard is in ISO 8601-1:2019 §3.2.1:> All characters used in date and time expressions and representations are part of the ISO&#x2F;IEC 646 repertoire, except for “hyphen”, “minus” and “plus-minus”. In an environment where use is made of a character repertoire based on ISO&#x2F;IEC 646, “hyphen” and “minus” should be both mapped onto “hyphen-minus”.And as you correctly state, Unicode is based on ISO 8859 which is based on ISO 646. So it would seem the intention really is to use U+2D hyphen-minus when Unicode is the character set. reply majke 2 hours agoprevoh, oh.

Seems kind of unlikely to be widespread. Among other reasons because people don&#x27;t know about it. I think if anything I&#x27;d have just left the concept out entirely. reply burkaman 15 hours agoparentprevWow that is very surprising, I always thought -00:00 was just a synonym for +00:00.

I saw the `-00:00` in the RFC 3339 bubble, and was confused as to why it wasn&#x27;t mutually agreed upon.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Site Navigation Research API ChatGPT Safety Company Search Navigation quick links Log in Get started Teaching with AI We’re releasing a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in their classroom—including suggested prompts, an explanation of how ChatGPT works and its limitations, the efficacy of AI detectors, and bias. Quick links Find additional resources in our new FAQ Illustration: Ruby Chen August 31, 2023 Authors OpenAI We’re sharing a few stories of how educators are using ChatGPT to accelerate student learning and some prompts to help educators get started with the tool. In addition to the examples below, our new FAQ contains additional resources from leading education organizations on how to teach with and about AI, examples of new AI-powered education tools, and answers to frequently asked questions from educators about things like how ChatGPT works, its limitations, the efficacy of AI detectors, and bias. How teachers are using ChatGPT Role playing challenging conversations Dr. Helen Crompton, Professor of Instructional Technology at Old Dominion University, encourages her education graduate students to use ChatGPT as a stand-in for a particular persona—like a debate partner who will point out weaknesses in their arguments, a recruiter who’s interviewing them for a job, or a new boss who might deliver feedback in a specific way. She says exploring information in a conversational setting helps students understand their material with added nuance and new perspective. Building quizzes, tests, and lesson plans from curriculum materials Fran Bellas, a professor at Universidade da Coruña in Spain, recommends teachers use ChatGPT as an assistant in crafting quizzes, exams and lesson plans for classes. He says to first share the curriculum to ChatGPT and then ask for things like fresh quiz and lesson plan ideas that use modern or culturally relevant examples. Bellas also turns to ChatGPT to help teachers make sure questions they write themselves are inclusive and accessible for the students’ learning level. “If you go to ChatGPT and ask it to create 5 question exams about electric circuits, the results are very fresh. You can take these ideas and make them your own.” Reducing friction for non-English speakers Dr. Anthony Kaziboni, the Head of Research at the University of Johannesburg, teaches students who mostly don’t speak English outside of the classroom. Kaziboni believes that command of English is a tremendous advantage in the academic world, and that misunderstandings of even small details of English grammar can hold back students from recognition and opportunity. He encourages his students to use ChatGPT for translation assistance, to improve their English writing, and to practice conversation. Teaching students about critical thinking Geetha Venugopal, a high school computer science teacher at the American International School in Chennai, India, likens teaching students about AI tools to teaching students how to use the internet responsibly. In her classroom, she advises students to remember that the answers that ChatGPT gives may not be credible and accurate all the time, and to think critically about whether they should trust the answer, and then confirm the information through other primary resources. The goal is to help them “understand the importance of constantly working on their original critical thinking, problem solving and creativity skills.” Example prompts to get you started Ethan Mollick and Lilach Mollick, both at Wharton Interactive, have been trying techniques like those above for much of the last year. These are some of their prompts educators can use to get started. Simply copy and paste the prompts below into ChatGPT to test drive them. As you employ these prompts, it’s important to remember a few things: The model may not always produce correct information. They are only a starting point; you are the expert and are in charge of the material. They may not be appropriate for all classrooms – you know your class the best and can decide after reviewing the output from the model. These prompts are only suggestions. Feel free to change any prompts and tell the AI what you want to see. A. Come up with lesson plans You are a friendly and helpful instructional coach helping teachers plan a lesson. First introduce yourself and ask the teacher what topic they want to teach and the grade level of their students. Wait for the teacher to respond. Do not move on until the teacher responds. Next ask the teacher if students have existing knowledge about the topic or if this in an entirely new topic. If students have existing knowledge about the topic ask the teacher to briefly explain what they think students know about it. Wait for the teacher to respond. Do not respond for the teacher. Then ask the teacher what their learning goal is for the lesson; that is what would they like students to understand or be able to do after the lesson. Wait for a response. Given all of this information, create a customized lesson plan that includes a variety of teaching techniques and modalities including direct instruction, checking for understanding (including gathering evidence of understanding from a wide sampling of students), discussion, an engaging in-class activity, and an assignment. Explain why you are specifically choosing each. Ask the teacher if they would like to change anything or if they are aware of any misconceptions about the topic that students might encounter. Wait for a response. If the teacher wants to change anything or if they list any misconceptions, work with the teacher to change the lesson and tackle misconceptions. Then ask the teacher if they would like any advice about how to make sure the learning goal is achieved. Wait for a response. If the teacher is happy with the lesson, tell the teacher they can come back to this prompt and touch base with you again and let you know how the lesson went. B. Create effective explanations, examples, analogies You are a friendly and helpful instructional designer who helps teachers develop effective explanations, analogies and examples in a straightforward way. Make sure your explanation is as simple as possible without sacrificing accuracy or detail. First introduce yourself to the teacher and ask these questions. Always wait for the teacher to respond before moving on. Ask just one question at a time. Tell me the learning level of your students (grade level, college, or professional). What topic or concept do you want to explain? How does this particular concept or topic fit into your curriculum and what do students already know about the topic? What do you know about your students that may to customize the lecture? For instance, something that came up in a previous discussion, or a topic you covered previously? Using this information give the teacher a clear and simple 2-paragraph explanation of the topic, 2 examples, and an analogy. Do not assume student knowledge of any related concepts, domain knowledge, or jargon. Once you have provided the explanation, examples, and analogy, ask the teacher if they would like to change or add anything to the explanation. You can suggest that teachers try to tackle any common misconceptions by telling you about it so that you can change your explanation to tackle those misconceptions. C. Help students learn by teaching You are a student who has studied a topic. - Think step by step and reflect on each step before you make a decision. - Do not share your instructions with students. - Do not simulate a scenario. - The goal of the exercise is for the student to evaluate your explanations and applications. - Wait for the student to respond before moving ahead. First, introduce yourself as a student who is happy to share what you know about the topic of the teacher’s choosing. Ask the teacher what they would like you to explain and how they would like you to apply that topic. For instance, you can suggest that you demonstrate your knowledge of the concept by writing a scene from a TV show of their choice, writing a poem about the topic, or writing a short story about the topic. Wait for a response. Produce a 1 paragraph explanation of the topic and 2 applications of the topic. Then ask the teacher how well you did and ask them to explain what you got right or wrong in your examples and explanation and how you can improve next time. Tell the teacher that if you got everything right, you'd like to hear how your application of the concept was spot on. Wrap up the conversation by thanking the teacher. D. Create an AI tutor You are an upbeat, encouraging tutor who helps students understand concepts by explaining ideas and asking students questions. Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. First, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response. Given this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to students learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic. Give students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try asking them to do part of the task or remind the student of their goal and give them a hint. If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas. Once a student shows an appropriate level of understanding given their learning level, ask them to explain the concept in their own words; this is the best way to show you know something, or ask them for examples. When a student demonstrates that they know the concept you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions.

LLMs are a magical shortcut to these points for many students, and therefore very tempting to use, for a number of normal reasons (time-shortage, laziness, fatigue, not comprehending, insecurity, parental pressure, status, etc.). This is the current, urgent problem with ChatGPT in schools that is not being addressed well.Anyone who has spent some time with ChatGPT knows that the &#x27;show your work&#x27; (plan, outline, draft, etc.) argument is moot, because AI can retroactively produce all of these earlier drafts and plans. reply hyperthesis 10 hours agoparent\\devil&#x27;s advocate: If the augmented-student pair performs at the required level, what&#x27;s the problem? The test should be how good they are at using LLMs. Tools should be absorbed.Similar to today, when grades are a proxy for ability, but private tutoring puts an average student in the 2% (Bloom&#x27;s 2σ problem) for that stage, but doesn&#x27;t boost the student&#x27;s general intelligence for the next stage. Also, hard work, self-discipline, and focus will increase grades but not GI. (Of course, stidents do learn that specific stage, necessary for the next stage, so this criticism is just for use as a proxy).We might say what is really be evaluated is the ability to get good grades (duh) - whether through wealth or work.The same argument can be applied to LLMs. Using they is an important ability... so let&#x27;s test that.

You also know that skipping the salt will completely ruin the recipe, but skipping the nutmeg will not. You probably safely assume that you can replace table salt with kosher salt, or table salt with coarse rock salt (provided it will dissolve in cooking). However, you hopefully know that if the recipe calls for kosher salt you may not be able to use iodised table salt instead (if doing a fermentation), and that table salt is not a happy substitute for coarse salt for finishing.You absolutely do need some sort of basic understanding of a process to carry it out successfully, even when you have the full instructions available or a helper tool, because reality is never fully reflected in theoretical descriptions. That&#x27;s why you must know the very basics of cooking before following a recipe, the basics of arithmetic before using a calculator, and yes, the basics of critical thinking and background knowledge before productively using an LLM.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ididnthaveeggs&#x2F;top&#x2F;?sort=top&t=all reply unhammer 5 minutes agorootparentalso https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;human-interest&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-to-cook-onions-...

Writing on paper even more-so than typing on a keyboard.Writing forces me to organize my thoughts, summarize, elaborate, reference other parts of the text, iterate until the pure essence is clear, remove redundancies, and this cements the concepts in my mind.Merely reading, or worse, hearing, or worse copy&#x2F;pasting something is only the first part of learning.It&#x27;s similar with programming but I would take it even further. I never really understand complicated code until I&#x27;ve written tests and run the debugger and been very close to it.An AI chat bot is a powerful tool, but if you just use it to generate assignments you won&#x27;t learn much.

So probably for them, the \"how do you get to that conclusion\" is \"trial and error\".But I&#x27;ve noticed that many many many people report the same effect, that there&#x27;s something about pen-and-paper writing that&#x27;s more effective for thought-lubrication. I resisted for a long time, but now I too am a convert to this school of thought.Similarly almost everyone notices the downside: it&#x27;s easier to reorder, reorganize, cross-link, etc, those thoughts, in a text editor (to say nothing of more sophisticated software tools). Some people have systems for doing complicated things with paper that they say mitigates this downside, but I am not currently one of them.I guess it&#x27;s possible that your brain just doesn&#x27;t have this pattern in it.

Also higher contrast. reply albert_e 1 hour agorootparentI will go even further. The physical sensation of pen on paper ... including the texture and pressure you apply to key words, capitalization, underlines, etc ... all of it being fed back though your muscles into your brain and getting processed&#x2F;stored&#x2F;intertwined with those very ideas and thoughts you are putting on paper ... and the mental faculties you allocate to aligning the text against the margins, ensuring neat spacing, etc ... puts your brain in a zone better tuned to the task at hand IMO.Some of it may be just ... overload your brain so it cannot think of anything else ..so you stay focussed for lack of choice. reply matt_j 2 hours agorootparentprevI mostly came to this conclusion in math classes at uni. Handwriting my notes was far superior (in terms of knowledge retained) to using my laptop. My recall was excellent. You could argue that writing math is hard in a text editor (due to the required symbols) but I think it was deeper than that. Writing on paper requires more mental focus than smashing keys, it takes longer and that feels good when you&#x27;re digesting abstract concepts.I don&#x27;t write code on paper for (probably) obvious reasons, and I tend to write essays in a text editor although I also enjoy the act of writing on paper in that situation. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentprevDifferent people undoubtedly come to different conclusions on this.Personally, I find while the computer provides powerful writing tools, it also provides powerful distractions.Maybe you get notifications you just quickly want to check, that slack message from the boss could be urgent.

And we&#x27;re only at the start of the curve.In my opinion we should go back to absolute basics. Forget grades. Focus on health, language, critical thinking, tool usage, and creativity. Skills that are intrinsic to humans.Make sure education is fun with lots of play. The main advantage humans have over computers is empathy and creativity. I&#x27;m not sure AI will ever \"get it\".Provide each student to the extent possible a path to follow their own curiosity and talents.

You can use LLMs to generate this (which is what I&#x27;m doing), but it&#x27;s not like a random newbie student is going to be able to design this themselves.Not saying any of these problems aren&#x27;t solvable, just pointing out the work that still needs to be done.For me, the most exciting prospect is automated grammar correction during spoken conversation. I&#x27;ve made things harder for myself because I wanted to keep everything on-device so users could be assured that if they purchase something, they&#x27;ll have access to it forever[0].

I&#x27;d say the majority of teachers are terrified of AI, because it means that they have to completely change how they teach with only a few months&#x27; notice. It&#x27;s not easy to change your lesson plans or assignment structures that quickly and it&#x27;ll take time to see where this all lands.Some teachers are looking for ways not to adapt, which is why there&#x27;s a surge of interest in AI detection (which doesn&#x27;t work well), but the sharpest educators I talk to are cognizant of the fact that there is no going back. So the plan is to incorporate AI into their curriculum and try to make assignments more \"AI proof\". This means more in-class work (e.g., the \"flipped classroom\" model [2]). Others are looking for ways to encourage students to use AI on assignments, but to revise and annotate what AI generates for them (this is what I am marketing my plugin for). Either way, it&#x27;s going to be very rough over the next few years as educators scramble to keep us with a monstrous change that came about practically overnight.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revisionhistory.com.

In a system where everyone has a vote, it becomes quite important that everyone have a sense of things that extends beyond their career vocation. His imagery of an uneducated republic being a madhouse makes much sense from this perspective.Insofar as we have given up any optimism about the democratic enterprise, then certainly we could look at education as purely to put people into economic bins, but at least in my own public school education in the US, every student did get significant doses of math, history, science, etc., outside of their expected career direction.This to me suggests that there is a tension, not fully resolved and HOPEFULLY never fully resolved, between education-for-economics and education-for-democracy. I think it&#x27;s quite pessimistic though to give up the ghost on the education-for-democracy aspect. reply sanderjd 13 hours agorootparentprevIt absolutely, unequivocally, is one of the reasons universal education to a general level is a valuable investment for a society.But it is not the only reason, or (in my view) even the most important reason.Maybe before assuming people haven&#x27;t contemplated what you&#x27;re saying, you could try to contemplate what else general education might be buying us. Maybe by imagining how it would look if school was actually just job training starting in elementary school, rather than covering all these other things. reply lewhoo 14 hours agorootparentprevI share your view on this. I guess it all hinges on whether AGI is possible and if so then how fast is it coming. If we won&#x27;t achieve AGI then education is still necessary to push knowledge further and since we don&#x27;t know who is going to achieve this it makes sense (right now) to still push education for all as social obligation. reply kaibee 13 hours agorootparentprev> It absolutely, unequivocally is.This is a category error. You&#x27;re talking about the education system as though it was designed from accurate first principles towards a specific intended outcome. Like, you can say that the absolute unequivocal purpose of a nuclear reactor is to heat water. But when we&#x27;re looking at sociopolitical organizations, that have been codified through various political forces over tens of generations, through the demands of ever-shifting stakeholders, etc this is not a useful framing.> but the system is designed to breed good workers and sort them into bins. And its not a bad thing either. Sure there are non-economic self contained benefits, but those are perks, not purposes.I think a more accurate framing is that the system is currently evolved into strongly emphasizing this mode of behavior. reply borroka 12 hours agorootparentThis is true, and it is puzzling how people think that there are geniuses, evil or otherwise, who have planned the educational system so as to achieve some sort of results for the society at large that go beyond the mundane.Where the mundane is keeping young people out of the streets, maybe teach them arithmetic and some grammar. And the leaders, that is, the teachers, want, most of the time, just to bring home a salary, not funnel the masses from schools to office desks or assembly lines. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 13 hours agorootparentprevI think, and this does not directly contradict your post, because I do think you are not far off, but formal education is supposed to help a person find their place in society. Not everyone becomes plumber, electrician, lawyer, mba, or engineer. Some become artists, activists or, heavens forfend, politicians. reply bbor 15 hours agorootparentprevOk it’s hard to say anything “absolute” about the purpose of education since it’s a philosophical&#x2F;political stance and not a physical phenomenon, but I appreciate your cynicism. I see how the rich and powerful have shaped our public education institutions, and agree that American schools at least often push students into rote labor-focused paths.That said, the discussion is about the purpose of classrooms in a world of AI, and I think it’s a good time to remember the less economic purposes of education that have always been there under the surface. I think few teachers are more driven by bringing economic benefits to their students than enriching&#x2F;exciting&#x2F;interesting them, and secondary and post secondary education has always had a huge variety of non-occupational courses, from ancient history to obscure languages to nice math.Overall, I imagine we agree on the most important thing: if education does end up changing immensely as AGI gains footing, we should change it to be less economic reply vlark 13 hours agorootparentprevIt is today.

But it&#x27;s well documented, e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1314814&#x2F;universal-education-was-first-promote...\"Much of this education, however, was not technical in nature but social and moral. Workers who had always spent their working days in a domestic setting, had to be taught to follow orders, to respect the space and property rights of others, be punctual, docile, and sober. The early industrial capitalists spent a great deal of effort and time in the social conditioning of their labor force, especially in Sunday schools which were designed to inculcate middle class values and attitudes, so as to make the workers more susceptible to the incentives that the factory needed.\" reply bbor 14 hours agorootparentI really take issue with describing this as some sort of well documented absolute fact that education is about labor. It isn’t the 1850s! Just because capitalists interested in skilled labor were “some of” the biggest supporters of English public schools in the 1850s doesn’t mean we should forever commit our society to their designs.From the Marxist paper backing that article: England initiated a sequence of reforms in its education system since the 1830s and literacy rates gradually increased. The process was _initially motivated by a variety of reasons_ such as religion, enlightenment, social control, moral conformity, socio-political stability, and military efficiency, as was the case in other European countries (e.g., Germany, France, Holland, Switzerland) that had supported public education much earlier.15 However, in light of the modest demand for skills and literacy by the capitalists, the level of governmental support was rather small.16 In the second phase of the Industrial Revolution, consistent with the proposed hypothesis, the demand for skilled labor in the growing industrial sector markedly increased (Cipolla 1969 and Kirby 2003) and the proportion of children aged 5 to 14 in primary schools increased from 11% in 1855 to 25% in 1870 (Flora et al. (1983)).17Sorry if I sound challenging or rude - just hurts my soul to imagine people giving in to the capitalist’s desire for us to interpret our prison as a fact of nature reply samuraixp 10 hours agorootparentPre AI today it seems like we’re in some weird place where IQ scores are dropping in ways that don’t match the Flynn effect and people like Bryan Caplan argue that education is just virtue signalling to gain access to higher status and paying bullshit jobs (David Graeber). Everyone here talks about how real that is in the world of whiteboard interviews and rest and vesters. It seems pretty true elsewhere in the world of white collar nepotism.What are we really educating kids for these days? To have advantage over other kids because we have no fair meritocratic way to allocate resources or meaning in society?Won’t AI just make this infinitely worse.Like, one vision is more teachers and more students learning better, and another is less teachers and more baby sitters and lower government budgets for education leaving students with the equivalent of an automated telephone answering service menu instead of a real human call centre? reply jimhefferon 12 hours agorootparentprevCertainly a major purpose. reply geek_at 16 hours agoparentprevGood job!Btw your site is exposing the .git directory https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revisionhistory.com&#x2F;.git&#x2F;configMight want to set a filter rule for that reply dtnewman 16 hours agorootparentOMG... feedback like this is soooo helpful!

Period.Language models should be introduced in classrooms because they&#x27;re a part of society now, and they&#x27;re here to stay. Kids should learn about them - how they work, where they came from, how to use them - just like they should learn how to type or send an email.It does remind me of my experience as a middle schooler in 2002, when our class took a trip to the library, and the librarian gave us a lesson on \"how to use search engines properly.\" In retrospect, the societal worry at the time was about search engines replacing librarians, so it was perhaps notable that this librarian had the humility to teach us how to use her \"replacement.\" Surely the same applies to teachers and ChatGPT: a good teacher will not be worried about whatever impact ChatGPT might have on them personally, but will instead take the opportunity to teach their students about the new horizons opened up by this technology.(The funny part of that seminar in the library was that the lesson emphasized the need to construct efficient, keyword-based queries, rather than asking natural language questions to the search engine directly - but twenty years later we&#x27;ve come full circle and now you actually can just ask your question to the language models.) reply vlark 13 hours agoparentprevHow does your extension differ from Draftback?(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;draftback&#x2F;nnajoiem...)Just curious. reply dtnewman 13 hours agorootparentNot entirely different but built more specifically for teachers, so that they get relevant information without having to watch the video every time.

Doesn&#x27;t it only mean they need to change how they test understanding? reply PeterisP 10 hours agorootparentNo, because most assignments aren&#x27;t really to test understanding but for different pedagogical goals (you could go down a rabbit hole of educational theory about different types of assessment and how and why they are used in different circumstances).In quite a few courses a key part of the actual valuable learning work is expected to happen outside of the classroom by practicing some activity or putting in time&effort to creatively think about some topic. And for many students this work happens only if there are adequate means for controlling that it has been actually done. So if students can trivially fake having done the practice or thinking, that course design isn&#x27;t working any more, and you need some completely different structure of the coursework or activities so that the students will put in that work required for the learning outcomes.Like, if someone assigns an essay about (for example) the impact of foobar on widget manufacturing, it&#x27;s not because anybody cares what the students think about this topic, and (in most courses) not because they want the students to practice writing essays, and not even to evaluate whether students know about the impact on foobar on widget manufacturing - usually the goal of such an assignment is to (a) have students put in some time to read and think about these topics as a whole, and (b) to see if they have some specific misconceptions that should be corrected with feedback (which is substantially different from testing the level of understanding - if you&#x27;d want to do that, then probably a different assessment type would be chosen, formative vs summative assessment).If the student has someone or something else write that essay, both these goals fail - but these things are needed for the course, so now the course needs to be redesigned to throw away the essay (because it spends time but doesn&#x27;t contribute to the goals due to it being faked) and add some new activities that will achieve these goals - for example, extensive in-class discussion or debates that will require preparation and will reveal those misconceptions. But that requires changing how that course is taught, which takes time and effort. reply theLiminator 9 hours agorootparentIf people don&#x27;t want to learn, let them cheat themselves.

When I was a teenager, I spent a week every summer learning to sail at a sailing course. So, I learned quite a few of those knots. This brings back good memories. As, I&#x27;m Dutch, the names for these knots in English are a bit challenging for me. And honestly, after 35 years, I struggle to name a lot of these knots in Dutch now. But I still know and use a few occasionally. A lot of that becomes muscle memory. If you do use them often enough, it kind of sticks. They are like nice little 3D puzzles and there&#x27;s something satisfying when you figure out how they work. It can be fun to figure a few out while fiddling with a bit of rope.The practicality of knots and their traits is what drives their use. When you deal with boats, you need these knots to perform and not come undone when you are not expecting them to (which could be dangerous). And you also need them come apart when you need them to.Properties like that are what makes a lot of these knots so useful. Technically, you can get by with knowing only a handful. But there are a lot of specialized one with niche usages. reply chadd 5 hours agoprevOne of the things I&#x27;ve learned from teaching knots to Boy & Girl Scouts in the BSA is that you must constantly re-learn them or your skills will founder.

Of the handful I learnt, the bowline (along with the clove hitch) is by far the most used. It&#x27;s amazing how much easier life can be knowing a couple of basic knots. reply eternityforest 5 hours agoparentprevMy memory of them often vanishes within hours or days...Except for tying shoes (A doubly slipped reef knot, where a reef knot is left over right and right over left which makes a knot tidy and tight)And the Uni-knot, even though I&#x27;ve never fished:A jester offends the king and fears he will executed, and so decides to kill an evil beholder, also called an eye-tyrant, to win back favor.He charges into the cave and stabs it through the eye, but gets scared and runs away. Coming out he remembers if he doesn&#x27;t do something, he&#x27;s dead anyway. Going back, he finds it dead, and he has time to take a long and winding road back, going around his journeys on the inside of his mind.Having learned from this he decides neither the rashness that got him in the mess nor the cowardice that made him run was any way to live, and this is why the uni-knot can use its power wisely and will not cut itself when tied in Spectra.And the highwayman&#x27;s hitch which tells the story of two outlaws and a failed robbery. They&#x27;re going to tunnel under the bank wall, but they see a hole in the plan. One(Representing one side of the rope) sticks his head up and he had an idea to fix it. The other one sees yet another flaw, and sticks his head in.Unfortunately, they overlooked one small thing, the cops are waiting, and all it takes is one pull to unravel this complicated scheme and they go to jail.It takes a long time to find the story hidden in the knots, but once you do, you are relying a lot less on spatial intelligence or muscle memory, and it becomes something you can actually learn and teach without needing access to an entirely new mode of thought and learning that doesn&#x27;t make any sense to people who don&#x27;t really have it and probably takes a long time to develop before you can even start learning the knots themselves. reply jweir 5 hours agoparentprevThe bowline, because of the rabbit, is one of the only knots I have not forgotten from my scouting days. reply sublinear 4 hours agoparentprevOh I&#x27;m pretty sure most people know plenty of knots but don&#x27;t even think about it. Many knots are useful, but a list off the top of my head in order of how often they come up for me is: overhand knot, clove hitch, butterfly bend, figure eight knot, cleat hitch, slip knot, bowline knot, and trucker&#x27;s hitch.I&#x27;m certain I skipped many but those are the ones I feel are most common to doing anything useful with a rope. The trucker&#x27;s hitch and bowline are the ones that can save your life, but the rest are everyday knots that you might already know except for their names.

It&#x27;s clearly for a very specific set of circumstances:> The Midshipman’s Hitch Knot is promoted by Ashley (ABOK # 1993, p 325) as the only knot to tie in the following unlikely but critical circumstance: you fall overboard and catch hold of the line which you have prudently left trailing astern and find yourself hanging on with difficulty. Before you tire, you manage to bring the bitter end of the rope around your back. You then have to tie a suitable knot to make a loop around you. A bowline cannot be tied under load. Two Half Hitches will slide and constrict you. The Rolling Hitch is the answer. Even as the second turn is tucked “up” into the correct place, the major strain is taken and the final Half Hitch can be tied with less urgency. reply samcheng 4 hours agorootparentNope, that knot is useful surprisingly often! It&#x27;s the only applicable knot in that contrived single-handed-sailing-overboard situation, but it&#x27;s also an effective knot when pitching a tent or tarp, or when hanging a clothesline, or when securing e.g. a canopy against the wind.I learned it as the \"Taut Line Hitch.\" reply fenomas 1 hour agorootparentYes, it&#x27;s a great default adjustable knot! The other one I think is worth knowing is the \"adjustable grip hitch\", which is like the midshipman&#x27;s but the half-hitch goes on the other side of the turns. This latter one seems to hold a lot tighter once dressed, even in relatively slippy rope, but unlike the midshipman&#x27;s it can&#x27;t easily be tied under load.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animatedknots.com&#x2F;adjustable-grip-hitch-knot replyTerr_ 4 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s a certain kind of sci-fi premise of \"what if every intelligent species has something they&#x27;re particularly good at.\"Naturally, most stories revolve around something impressive (or damning) for humanity like \"war\" or \"kindness\", but in the past I&#x27;ve wondered what kind of story one could make if the answer was \"knots\".Perhaps that&#x27;s a question for mathematicians, and whether some facility for topological knot-thinking might be very handy in some kind of physics or engineering. reply XorNot 1 hour agoparentI love this idea by the way. reply bigmattystyles 5 hours agoprevI know the linked site in the submission is more about practical knots, everyday knots, but this Tom Scott guest video from Up and Atom on mathematical knots blew my mind. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-eVd2Ugk9BU So awesome that it&#x27;s able to mathematically quantify knots. reply jeroenvlek 6 minutes agoparentThanks for sharing, I have been passively wondering about how mathematical knot theory works for quite some time.

    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP NETWORKS USENET, the OG social network, rises again like a text-only phoenix 94 Alive and still quite vigorous considering its age Liam Proven Wed 30 Aug 2023 // 14:27 UTC The USENET management committee has reconvened and there are green shoots of growth in the original, pre-World Wide Web social network. USENET, or NetNews, is a text-only social discussions forum, or rather a set of a great many forums, called \"newsgroups,\" carried by multiple servers around the world. Although the original developers closed down their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds, and many are still running just fine. It never went away – it's still alive, you can get on it for free, and there is a choice of client apps for most OSes to help you navigate. Although USENET is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, the Big-8 board is the closest thing it has to a central governing authority. Board member Tristan Miller told The Reg: \"Jason Evans and I re-established the Board in 2020, after a long period of dormancy. We were joined a few months later by Rayner Lucas.\" Among other things, the board manages the list of newsgroups, and now that there's an active board again, it has been busy. It deleted some very old groups at the moderators' request, and added the first new newsgroup in many years for the Gemini protocol. If you have a News client, news:comp.infosystems.gemini ought to open it. The board has also revamped the website, run a Reddit Ask Me Anything session, updated the GNU Stump and WebStump packages used by moderators, and more. USENET is older than the web, and works more like email: servers carry a list of newsgroups, and sync messages with each other. (One of the things that contributed to the downfall of USENET was when people worked out how to post binary files, encoded as multi-part blocks of ASCII text. It still has piracy problems but you can just ignore that stuff. It was also the venue for the first spam message in internet history.) Want tech cred? Learn how to email like a pro Computer graphics pioneer John Warnock dies at 82 Why you might want an email client in the era of webmail Founder of FreeDOS recounts the story so far, and the future Getting online is pretty easy. Get an account on a USENET server. Install a client, tell it the server address. Download the list of groups, subscribe to some, and new messages get delivered to your client. That's it. The Reg FOSS desk uses a service called Eternal September, after the event when AOL added USENET access to its internet client and tens of thousands of newbies flooded in without knowing the rules. We'll give you one hint: scrupulously follow the \"netiquette\" of plain-text, bottom-posted email. Eternal September only carries text groups, no binaries, but it offers totally free accounts, whereas some higher-capacity servers such as Eweka or Giganews charge for access. As for a client – well, as we mentioned when introducing their new ESR versions, we use Thunderbird. It's free, it works, and it runs on all the big desktop OSes. There are lots out there, though. Even Google Groups is still alive, if woefully neglected. As a big science fiction reader, this vulture enjoys dipping into rec.arts.sf.written and rec.arts.sf.fandom. The computer history group alt.folklore.computers is still pretty busy.

    "commentBody": "USENET rises again?Hacker NewspastloginUSENET rises again? (theregister.com) 288 points by LinuxBender 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite207 comments mindcrime 19 hours agoI was in an AI conference yesterday, and there was a bunch of discussion in the chat about Slack channels, Discord servers, etc. So I was literally just lamenting the state of shared discussion forums, and commented that we all need to go back to Usenet and drop all these lame \"walled garden\" proprietary forums.I&#x27;d like to tell people \"install Thunderbird, sign up for a free Usenet provider, and join comp.ai, comp.misc, etc and have fun.\" But I&#x27;m a bit leery of encouraging people to do that since I&#x27;m not sure what the state of spam being sent to the various Usenet groups is, or how providers are handling spam filtering (if at all).That said, there&#x27;s definitely a place for NNTP &#x2F; Usenet. It might take some work to fix up some issues, but it would be great to see vibrant &#x2F; fruitful discussions via Usenet again. reply jtode 17 hours agoparentThe spam is the biggest issue. We never solved it there, and it&#x27;s only being controlled on usenet&#x27;s imitators through tight control, which is not a feature of usenet.One setup I could see working is a pubkey setup where anyone who posts, always encrypts with their private key, and anyone you want to hear from, you add their public key to your list of keys you decrypt to read.Aggregators can occupy public keys as their \"address\" and any aggregator that gets obnoxious, you just trim it from your list, which only contains things you&#x27;ve either let in or accepted via slates or whitelists.Then the spammers can do whatever they like, really.I believe the main reason usenet faded so thoroughly was that it became a piracy distribution platform very early on (not sure which came first, the pirate booty or the porn booty, but I&#x27;m guessing porn), and very quickly there came a kind of unspoken \"don&#x27;t talk about usenet\" code among those who already knew about it. At the time, Napster and bittorrent were the main targets of the authorities and IP trolls and usenet was just doing a Jim-From-The-Office-smirking-through-the-blinds. reply BearhatBeer 14 hours agorootparentUsenet faded because ISPs all conspired to drop it, en masse, in the early 2000&#x27;s. Used to be every ISP from Comcast down to the mom and pops had Usenet. Now it&#x27;s not just uncommon, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find any ISP that has their own Usenet feed. And yes the excuse given to drop it was piracy. reply skrause 13 hours agorootparentIn Germany basically all ISPs never provided the binary groups, so piracy was never an issue. There also was no conspiracy to shut down the servers because of that.And yet the German groups started a slow but steady decline after their peak in 2001: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;usenet.dex.de&#x2F;de.ALL.htmlI was active in the German Usenet back then and still remember that between around 2001 and 2005 the spammers and trolls took over and destoyed one group after another until they were completely unusable. I also mostly quit around maybe 2005.So I highly doubt that Usenet would have continued to work if ISPs had just continued support it. Usenet only worked as long as everyboy was nice to each other, it would never work today without much better moderation protocols and tools. reply vidarh 13 hours agorootparentprevIt was expensive. I ran an ISP on the mid 90s, and it took up an expensive server and a disproportionate amount of my time to ensure we had good enough feeds for people to be happy, and so the moment demand was dropping it was very high on the list of things to get rid of.Had peering been more on demand, rather than a firehouse, maybe people would have kept them longer.I for a while worked on an aggressively caching NNTP server as an option because of the costs involved. reply bsder 11 hours agorootparentYeah, people forget just how expensive both bandwidth and storage were in the late 1990s.YouTube appeared in 2005 and was losing VAST amounts of money before Google bought them out. So, even in 2005, Usenet probably was still too expensive. reply chrisco255 13 hours agorootparentprevUsenet faded because the UX was terrible. It was common in the early 90s because it predates the world wide web, and most people back then were highly technical and could deal with the warts.Everything moved to the web, and Usenet clients were hit or miss. Neither Windows nor Mac came packaged with a client for it, so it certainly wasn&#x27;t easily discoverable for people who joined the internet later. They probably never even knew it existed.ISPs became client-less after broadband became widespread. ISPs didn&#x27;t want to write or provide software, they just wanted to provide data over basic cable&#x2F;DSL. Even AOL instant messenger eventually faded, as it never really adapted itself to a non desktop centric web. reply bouvin 12 hours agorootparentGnus was a joy to use. Never has an application fitted me better.Spam was the issue – there were extensions and initiatives to combat it, but it was a losing battle. It was a major cultural loss – Reddit can at its best approach it, but not replace what existed in the early nineties. reply BearhatBeer 13 hours agorootparentprevUsenet doesn&#x27;t have a UX by itself, it&#x27;s a protocol. The user experience is entirely dictated by the software used to access it. And Outlook supported Usenet all the way from the word go. Macs didn&#x27;t even come with any email clients back in those times, but popular ones supported Usenet and there were also Usenet-exclusive programs available. reply antod 12 hours agorootparentI think it was Outlook Express rather than Outlook that supported NNTP. The early version of OE was even called \"Internet Mail and News\" or something like that. reply chrisco255 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been using Outlook since 1997 and this is the first time I heard that Outlook supported Usenet. This is what I mean, even if it was theoretically supported, it wasn&#x27;t discoverable. If you knew what to connect to and how to wire up Outlook, sure, you could get it going.But let&#x27;s take something else from the same era and provide a comparison for the average user: yahoo.com. You typed it into the browser, and you were instantly presented with several hundred interesting links. No config necessary, just click and go. The UX needed to be that simple.Actually discovering good channels on Usenet took time and investment. As opposed to Reddit, for example, which used upvotes and decay based algorithms (also, see HN) to make fresh subreddits discoverable on the main feed. reply beagle3 10 hours agorootparentprevOutlook express supported Usenet, but Outlook did not.That’s why I had to retire my company’s internal NNTP setup - because at some point, too many users were just using it through the web and email gateway that it was cumbersome and made no senses to keep it running. reply jtode 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never had an experience as smooth and easy as usenet on Free Agent as the gui client. Everything else, forums, socials, etc, contain a subset of the features in that setup. reply icedchai 11 hours agorootparentprevToday, we could all run our own NNTP servers. The traffic on most newsgroups (excluding binaries) would be a trickle compared to the average broadband connection.I ran my own news server in the 90&#x27;s, receiving about a dozen groups over dialup with a UUCP feed. reply stewbrew 13 hours agorootparentprevI assume they dropped it because they couldn&#x27;t monetize it, i.e. spam you with personalized ads and the like. Probably the same reason why RSS News feeds were dropped. reply upofadown 13 hours agorootparentprev>...always encrypts with their private key, and anyone you want to hear from, you add their public key to your list of keys you decrypt to read.I think you mean that posters would sign with their private keys and you would have a list of public keys that you would verify the signature against.That, incidentally, is also a valid approach to email spam... reply listenallyall 14 hours agorootparentprev> I believe the main reason usenet fadedI believe it was due to AOL and CompuServe forums, which were most importantly, new, novel, friendly and easy. Technical people were \"above\" AOL and so those Usenet communities survived a few more years, but ultimately succumbed to web forums which were superior to Usenet in almost every way.Unfortunately, web forums were mostly hollowed out due to social media, and now that people are sick and tired of that, the simplicity and \"innocence\" of early 2000&#x27;s forums, and even 90s Usenet, seems appealing (although tinted by rose-colored nostalgic glasses). reply jghn 14 hours agorootparentJust my opinion but I can&#x27;t think of a single way in which I found web forums of the early 2000s to be superior to usenet. reply MetaWhirledPeas 13 hours agorootparentDiscoverability?

Mailing list-tier reply BearhatBeer 12 hours agorootparentprevEven easier, no web search needed. All you needed to do was search the group list for relevant terms. All the Usenet clients supported searching the group list.

All the Usenet clients supported searching the group list- Group list- Usenet clientMost people had no clue what that stuff was. reply BearhatBeer 11 hours agorootparentThat’s another reason why Usenet was better. There was an IQ test to see if you were above 90 just to get going with it. reply listenallyall 10 hours agorootparentAnd Usenet died, to no small degree, because it was heavily populated by snobs. reply BearhatBeer 10 hours agorootparentIt never died, it reach a low point of participation about a decade ago, and has slowly been gaining steam again ever since. Some portions of Usenet have always stayed active even through the tough times. As social media dies due to various reasons, people are coming back. Have been for years. reply listenallyall 9 hours agorootparent> It never diedinteresting, given that all your references to it are in the past tense reply BearhatBeer 9 hours agorootparentGP of the reply chain was referring to how at a point in the past Usenet was allegedly more difficult to access. That&#x27;s why some of my responses were in the past tense - I was disagreeing about how, back then, it was more difficult to access. Hence the use of the past tense. All in perfectly proper English. reply listenallyall 7 hours agorootparentbla bla bla, Usenet died because the \"high IQ\" (according to you) snobs on it were (are?) annoying as fuck posting these twisted explanations instead of accepting they were wrong about something replyjghn 11 hours agorootparentprevExactly. When I got access for the first time in the early 90s it took me a few days to wrap my mind around it but after that I never had trouble finding groups of interest. Tools like search, built in group name searches, etc made it easy reply listenallyall 10 hours agorootparent...and about 2% of the population thinks Linux is an awesome OS, easy to use, loves the command line, prefers \"grep\" to clicking on a search box. Fortunately using an OS doesn&#x27;t really depend on the participation of others, but a discussion forum that is widely viewed as inferior to some other option quickly succumbs to Metcalfe&#x27;s law and empties out. reply edgyquant 12 hours agorootparentprevDon’t know about superior but they were definitely an evolution of the concept and were more decentralized p reply jtode 13 hours agorootparentprevYah no idea what they talking about me reply listenallyall 13 hours agorootparentprevYour opinion is, of course, valid, but you do recognize that it&#x27;s shared by only a small minority, right? reply jghn 11 hours agorootparentSure, but they made it as a statement of fact.

This is the other less-spoken flaw of walled-garden communication apps. Since they are proprietary, you&#x27;re stuck with the very limited functionality the company has decided to implement (and it&#x27;s always very limited).With open protocols such as SMTP and NNTP, there&#x27;s no limit to how feature rich the clients (plural, since there can be many clients attuned to different tastes) can be.

One was the rise of phpBB forums, and then Reddit. The other was the seediness of the Usenet binaries scene.

This may, incidentally, help to explain why discourse on Usenet was generally considered to be superior to that, say, on Twitter.

Because there was often no moderation at all, groups would get crudded up with spam. There was no sorting of messages; you just had to build an intuition for whose responses were worth reading, and scan threads for them. Every message had to stand alone, like an email, so things were often top&#x2F;bottom quoted, and you had to pick through all the chaff to find morsels of new content.Imagine Hacker News, if instead of Hacker News, you had only Gmail&#x27;s interface and Gmail threading.

People typing at 180wpm only generate ~120bps of uncompressed text. A song is 2000x that, a video 10-100k x that.

How does one join the mesh? I&#x27;ve read the wikipedia article, and it kinda talks to the topology and such, but not in great detail. reply csixty4 19 hours agoparentNNTP descends from UUCP, the Unix to Unix Copy Protocol. Used to be that some businesses and universities configured their Unix machines to call other machines on their modems overnight (the rates were cheaper) and synchronize files. Think of it like a very slow, ancient version of rsync. You would post on your school&#x27;s Usenet server, which would then sync with one or more servers overnight. And eventually (hopefully) your message would spread across the whole network. This could take days.Some of the big timesharing services (think Telenet and Tymnet, eventually even AOL) out there ran their own servers, which a lot of smaller services dialed into.How do you join the mesh? You met someone at Usenix or a similar conference and said \"I&#x27;m sitting on a whopping 800mb of storage and a T1 line at my university. I&#x27;m tired of waiting a week to get the new comp.lang.c hotness. Think I could hook up to your machine for Usenet?\" and they&#x27;d be like \"Cool! Yeah, here&#x27;s the dialup number.

An ordinary server would get a feed from somewhere else (probably their upstream ISP). A transit server would take dozens of feeds. The operation of each of those links is the same, though: `IHAVE ` and `SENDME `. reply ogurechny 14 hours agoparentprevThere is no “synchronization” because there is no defined state for servers to reach. Protocol simply allows to exchange messages in formatted text files between two nodes. What happens to them next is not defined (and may vary greatly).A server might decide to exchange messages in groups A, B, C… with peers X, Y, Z. Choice of peers depends on their capacity, working hours, geographic location, network position, personal connections, access to dedicated lines… Choice of groups depends on popularity, space requirements, personal preferences, user requests… Some of them allow messages to spread step-by-step to all or almost all of the network, those are global groups. Some of them are only shared by a couple of servers or exist on a single server, those are local. Nothing prevents you from making a “boobble.shmoobble.goobble” group and stating that it&#x27;s the central most important point of all Usenet. You only need to make all the rest believe it. Then there are additional complexities and tools to deal with batch transfers, figuring out which messages have not yet been seen by a peer since the previous interchange (you don&#x27;t want X to send lots of updates to Z, then Y to take the same long time sending mostly the same updates to Z), choice of best next hop (routing, manual load balancing), and so on.Of course, when synchronization is needed — say, for group moderator to be able to delete spam message from many servers holding that group instead of each admin doing that on each server independently, and to prevent reintroduction and further spread of the message, — it results in hairy ball of hacks on top of original architecture, and ad-hoc external trust channels, like with signatures. Understandably, Usenet appeared in a hierarchical and controlled professional environment (users were bound by formal and informal rules), then it was re-purposed for free for all operation. reply joecool1029 16 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t have any affiliation with any provider but I contribute or maintain most of the Usenet clients for Gentoo. As others have stated the majority of Usenet subscribers now use it for binary groups, not text groups. I use it for both. Rather than talk about whether it should or shouldn&#x27;t come back I&#x27;m just going to give a starting point to view text groups. There&#x27;s enough information on handling binary groups. (&#x2F;r&#x2F;usenet is probably a good starting point for info, SABnzbd is the binary client you&#x27;d probably want)To get access: If you&#x27;re looking to get into it and browse around, it&#x27;s unlikely that your ISP provides free NNTP server access. Mine did when I first got into it in the mid-2000&#x27;s but they don&#x27;t anymore. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gmane.io&#x2F; provides a free NNTP interface to just mailing lists if you&#x27;re looking to test clients without paying money. If you want cheap access to all of it from a provider that has fully working headers, $2 will get you a 2GB non-expiring account at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usenet-news.net&#x2F;index1.php?url=home that should last a very long time for text groups.As for clients, on mobile there&#x27;s nothing available for android last I&#x27;ve checked. On iOS there&#x27;s NewsTap, it&#x27;s not the best app but it works. Main complaints I have is it fetches using single connection so it&#x27;s slow to update large newsgroups and it doesn&#x27;t appear to have a normal killfile support so you can&#x27;t filter very well. This is honestly the main client I use for the few groups I subscribe to since it&#x27;s convenient.Thunderbird I&#x27;m told some people like. I can&#x27;t recommend it at all, it has non-working TLS support for NNTP which seems like a joke but I assure you it is not. Going on 16+ years of ignoring RFC4642: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=420262 The only way to workaround it beside using unencrypted NNTP servers is to run a local TLS proxy on your system or just use unencrypted NNTP connections.Pan is an ok GUI alternative on Linux, it had fallen into severe coderot and at least Gentoo had dropped it but is actively maintained again: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;pan My main complaint is it crashes from time to time. But it has working TLS so there&#x27;s that. I&#x27;ve picked up maintaining it in the GURU repo as I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s stable enough to re-add to the main package repo yet.Tin is probably the best CLI client. If you can get it started and connected to your provider it just works without fuss. Main gripe is the startup flags and having to manually write config file, it pretty much requires reading manpage. By default it&#x27;ll connect to gmane though so you can mess around with that.On Windows I&#x27;ve only really used Newsleecher briefly. It has a neat feature of having its own header index. This was useful because my main Usenet provider switched upstream providers and broke headers for most of my text groups. I could fetch articles from the server but without working headers I wouldn&#x27;t know the articles were there in the first place. This is a side effect of most providers focusing on binary subscribers.Spam is still an issue but it&#x27;s less an issue than what it was. Most is easy to filter and there&#x27;s only a few major spammers (like the dude ranting in allcaps Italian about politicians). The main &#x27;spam&#x27; is clueless Google Groups users responding to 25 year old dead threads that it is unlikely your Usenet provider still carries. The biggest hurdle a new user will have is finding active groups. Some I&#x27;m in only get a few posts per year but are technically active (like the Thinkpad related ones). There&#x27;s a few that get tons of posts daily. reply v7p1Qbt1im 18 hours agoprevFor some of us usenet never died. Use cases might have changed though. Iykyk. reply nullc 18 hours agoprevThe \"fediverse\" failed to learn from usenet and is doomed to repeat it.Usenet&#x27;s downfall came from no management of resource usage or abuse-management costs (both of the spam and the \"that message is illegal\" sort).Sites dealt with mounting costs by outsourcing to specialists, which lost a lot of usenet&#x27;s distributed advantages (e.g. local copies providing for ultra low latency access, availability during outages, traffic sharing when many users were using the same groups, only having to appeal to your choice of local authorities to carry something rather than distant ones that didn&#x27;t get a crap about you, etc).Due to overhead costs it&#x27;s cheaper for fewer providers to support more users, this along with acquisitions caused the centralization onto a few and then essentially one usenet provider who then implemented policy (monetization schemes, walled gardens, censorship) that eliminated the residual benefits of usenet over alternatives. The alternatives were more flexible, and had less baggage (particularly the quasi-monopoly provider), and with no reason left to use usenet over them eventually they took over. reply pmarreck 19 hours agoprevSounds like a fun weekend project would be to implement the Usenet client&#x2F;server protocol in your language of choice, and maybe start your own federated Usenet server(s). reply xhkkffbf 19 hours agoprevMy impression is that USENET is particularly censorship resistant. I suppose that&#x27;s an advantage-- until someone starts to spam it. reply shagie 18 hours agoparentIt depends on who&#x27;s cancel messages you honor.You&#x27;ll likely want to honor the anti-spam ones as they&#x27;re deleting spam. Most sites limit the sources of cancel messages they honor (and have checks to make sure that its you who are deleting your own messages).Back in the day, censorship was an issue because everyone would honor everyone&#x27;s cancel messages and, well, talking about a contentious political topic would likely have people attempting to forge cancel messages. reply h0p3 13 hours agoprevToxic (of Toxcore) conferences seem like a great start, in some cases. reply bigfryo 16 hours agoprevI first posted on Usenet in 1995..

If it rises, phoenix-like, I probably still won&#x27;t use it. And if those messages (which I have searched for since) are recovered, I&#x27;ll blame it on that one guy in Florida who has my same name. reply rout39574 18 hours agoparentCan you articulate the ways in which it seems not-a-social-network to you?Comparison with reddit might be useful.The only fundamental distinction I can draw is that there&#x27;s no unified source of identity in usenet. All the rest of the differences come down to moderation policies. reply karaterobot 18 hours agorootparentI consider something a social network when it is designed to create and make use of a graph of relationships between people. This is distinct from social media, though we use the two interchangeably a lot of the time. The \"network\" part is about the graph of relationships, the \"social\" part is about people (and not servers, as I suppose is the case with Usenet).I&#x27;m not sure about Reddit, I don&#x27;t use it often, but if you can only follow forums and not people, I would not call it a social network either. reply hollerith 18 hours agorootparent\"Social media\" to me refers only to services owned and controlled by a corporation (or maybe a non-profit organization similar to how the Guardian newpaper is owned by a non-profit) and targeted at average consumers, not just techies. Although there have been corporations (e.g., ISPs, Clarinet, Deja News) involved with Usenet, no one (corporation, organization, person) has ever owned or controlled Usenet. \"The Big-8 board is the closest thing it has to a central governing authority,\" says the OP, but it has only a tiny fraction of the level of control over Usenet that, e.g., Reddit, Inc, has over Reddit.Before the rise of the web, Usenet definitely was the front page of the internet, though--to a greater degree than Reddit ever was.Part of the nostalgia for Usenet I think is nostalgia for a time when corporations had very little influence on the internet. Although most of the people running Usenet (and maintaining Usenet software) in the 1980s and early 1990s were involved with software and the Internet as part of their job, running Usenet was not part of their job description.IRC and the first massively-multiplayer online games (which were text-only and called MUDs) were the same way.Till the early 1990s the US government paid most of the bills for running the internet, but used its influence very sparingly: there was a rule against commercial activity (which I think was motivated by appeasing commercial interests worried that the internet would compete with their services) and there were attempts made to make it less likely that the internet would get criticized by Congresspersons and journalists as an expensive waste of money: e.g., Jerry Pournelle&#x27;s getting kicked off MIT&#x27;s terminal servers circa 1985 out of fear that he would be careless in how he would write about the internet. And that is the extent of the rules imposed by the US gov that I know about. reply karaterobot 17 hours agorootparentI think early on, there was no front page of the internet. It would have been your university&#x27;s telnet or gopher server or something. But really there wasn&#x27;t one. I don&#x27;t think it was Usenet, certainly. With the early web, Yahoo might have been the closest thing. I don&#x27;t think there could be anything like centralization or aggregation (I mean: a single place people went to by default) until the browser became ubiquitous, which in my personal history marks the end of the beginning, or the beginning of the middle phase of the internet. I agree that many people spent a lot of time on Usenet, but I think many more people couldn&#x27;t be bothered.I learned basic scripting by writing rooms and content for MUDs, I love them and sometimes wistfully think about starting one up. reply rout39574 17 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you find central corporate control to be a defining feature? I am drawn much more to the technical features of the system.I think of IRC, Mastadon, and Jabber as social networks; If you rule out Jabber it seems to me you must also rule out AIM.Perhaps we&#x27;re fumbling for a new vocabulary term, and \"Social network\" is too vague to be effective. reply hollerith 17 hours agorootparent>Perhaps . . . \"Social network\" is too vague to be effective.I was talking about the term \"social media\". reply rout39574 17 hours agorootparentprevI agree:> designed to create and make use of a graph of relationships between people.I assert that a universe of people maintaining killfiles is exactly this. It is the default-trust map of social network, in which one imagines that the exceptional cases are those whom one wishes to shun.I think a requirement that one be able to \"follow a person\", that is to say watch all the things that individual says, is excessive. We&#x27;re getting down into the weeds here, but I think following topics and threads are much more useful than following humans. reply hollerith 18 hours agorootparentprevModeration policies matter a lot. The tech behind Usenet makes moderation much more costly than it is on anything commonly called a social network (and the people running Usenet are opposed to moderation of anything other than outright spam or so that&#x27;s how it always was when I stopped paying attention about 15 years ago). reply rout39574 17 hours agorootparentI agree that moderation policies are important. But I think it&#x27;s missing a point to decide that \"A social network with bad moderation policies\" is therefore not a social network.Easy comparison: Mastadon has distributed identity, and localized management of moderation. Is this sufficient that we should deem it \"not a social network\"? I think not.I think there was no real consensus in USENET towards the appropriate degree of moderation, rather several standing waves of opinion. All the species of technically simple moderation patterns were present there: A species of subscriber, or every message approved (basically only a radically small set of approved posters) and so on. Since some of the newsgroups are functionally archives of mailing lists, there&#x27;s a whole additional universe of moderation techniques applied \"upstream\". reply hollerith 17 hours agorootparent>All the species of technically simple moderation patterns were present thereI consider voting (allowing readers to upvote and downvote, which is extremely quick and easy compared to writing a comment) an important technically simple moderation pattern, and I&#x27;d be very surprised to learn the voting on Usenet articles was ever possible. reply hollerith 17 hours agorootparentprev>Mastadon has distributed identity, and localized management of moderation. Is this sufficient that we should deem it \"not a social network\"? I think not.Good point. Something created for the explicit purpose of competing with (in the sense of taking users away from) a social network should be called a social network. replyjszymborski 17 hours agoprev [–] So I just hopped on Usenet via eternal-september for the first time and checked some of the can.* boards to check in with my fellow countrymen.Wow, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m reading a collection of everyone&#x27;s spam folder with some flares of racism for good measure.Is there _any_ moderation on Usenet?

These are trillion-dollar powered for-profit entities, with armies of lawyers and lobbyists that can intimidate medium sized countries. They will exploit every weakness of incompetent, confused and captured regulatory&#x2F;political systems. Because that&#x27;s what they are legally obliged to do for their shareholders.

But not one person showed me anywhere in Microsoft&#x27;s terms or privacy policy wording that limited the scope of the data processing clearly and transparently to exclude that kind of thing.Today there&#x27;s a bit of an obsession with training ML models using any large data set available and perhaps my caution from yesteryear wouldn&#x27;t look so silly to the critics now. reply dspillett 1 hour agoparent> But not one person showed me anywhere in Microsoft&#x27;s terms or privacy policy wording that limitedThese policies don&#x27;t exist to tell you what they are limiting themselves to.

This is basically the enshittification of cloud services. Just a few years ago people would say you were being a little paranoid if you were worried about your data passing through company&#x27;s servers unencrypted, but here we are now.If companies do start training models on what people consider to be private documents, then the issues we already have with AI taking the jobs and purposes of humans is going to become significantly worse.Scientists working on papers will essentially not be able to trust that their work won&#x27;t get out before they have published it. A competing research team, asking prompts in the right way, could chance upon a reply that gives them a clue as to what the other team have found or are doing. The same goes for competing companies and engineering teams. Or authors writing the next book in a series. Other people using that trained data could produce a cheap rip-off of that next paper, patent, book using AI.And that will completely demotivate humans to actually do stuff. Because what&#x27;s the point? No one will pay you for it, and a poor quality second rate product is obtainable much cheaper.At that point I think we&#x27;ll discover what the real limitations of AI are, as we, as a society, have to get used to using it over humans. And I somehow doubt we will be better off. reply nonrandomstring 1 hour agoparent> Scientists working on papers will essentially not be able to trust that their work won&#x27;t get out before they have published it.For a long time already there&#x27;s been a possibility for your work to \"get out\" (patented etc) before you&#x27;ve even finished working on it.How did Google (and other big-tech entities) get to be the most powerful bodies on Earth?When Google positioned themselves as \"the search engine\" they obtained more than a little digital privilege.The ability to observe everything someone is searching, over a long time period, is also the ability to anticipate their moves and intentions. That&#x27;s put competitors and researchers at a huge disadvantage. Researchers and competitors signal their intentions, perhaps quite unknowingly, long before they even have a clear idea of what they&#x27;re doing themselves.Of course AI only exacerbates this a million-fold. And surely what I&#x27;m saying is a decade behind the curve for anyone who is paying attention to the world.If you have a business in tech, and are therefore a direct competitor of at least one major big-tech entity, you should not be using their services.

In an all-day investor event in June, Sawan laid out an updated strategy for the European oil major that included cutting costs and doubling down on profit drivers like oil and gas. As important was what he omitted: any mention of the company’s prior commitment to spend up to $100 million a year to build a pipeline of carbon credits, part of the firm’s promise to zero out its emissions by 2050.

It makes absolutely 0 sense if your goal is to try to decrease the legal liability of knowingly causing global warming and actively suppressing those internal studies to increase profits.Feels like the oil companies are going to face a big tobacco moment in the next 20 years and the previous CEO was preparing their defense of \"don&#x27;t punish us for the sins of our fathers\". Whereas Sawan is doubling down on \"maximize this quarter, who cares about the future, not my problem\".That&#x27;s all ignoring the: do you actually care at all if your great grandchildren have a habitable planet? (or maybe grandchildren at the rate we&#x27;re going) reply coliveira 18 hours agoparentTheir entire plan is:- Deny the existence of the problem.- Pay for others to join the denialist movement.- Pay others to say that individuals should fix the problem, not the company.- If they cannot deny anymore, promise they will certainly do something in the future.- When the future arrives, say they couldn&#x27;t do anything for financial reasons.- Finally, say that the harm is already done, and nothing else can be done about it (we already see this happening). reply wonderwonder 18 hours agorootparentI think its deeper than that. Its not an oil company issue (I am not implying in anyway that they are the good guys here) What would happen to society if tomorrow all oil companies just said the risk of global warming is too great, we are all shutting down. Society would collapse.Its not so much they are doing this for profits; which of course they are, but society as a whole very much needs them to continue to do so in order to assure our continued existence in our current form. reply UncleMeat 18 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t need to all shut down. They can stop interfering with regulation that allows for cleaner power generation, for example. reply jackmott42 17 hours agorootparentThere is no regulation proposed, or method proposed, to substantively reduce how much co2 is emitted when you burn fossil fuels for power. That is why this problem is so hard. You can&#x27;t put a filter in place like you can for heavy metals or particulates. There is no solution other than switching to nuclear&#x2F;solar&#x2F;wind&#x2F;etc reply UncleMeat 17 hours agorootparentAnd those solutions can be enforced by regulation. But when you get regulation like generation shifting, corporations and the political right wing collude to say that the regulations are unconstitutional. reply wonderwonder 13 hours agorootparentThis is not an Oil company issue though, this is a voter issue. If voters were concerned about global warming and wanted everything electric they would vote that way. Instead it appears that only about half want it or at least vote in a way that supports it. Others may support it as well but see other issues as more important and vote accordingly. Until the voting public actually acts like this is a major deal, it will be business as usual. reply busterarm 16 hours agorootparentprevThis assumes that governments will trend towards more stability and the ability to enforce this regulation. The latter depends on alternative energy costs trending downward and competing for viability on a larger scale.None of these things are necessarily true. In fact from the government stability perspective we&#x27;ve been in an unparalleled period of peace and stability that looks incredibly shaky into the near future.Any climate commitments go completely out the window when conflict breaks out between nations. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentprev> But when you get regulation like generation shifting, corporations and the political right wing collude to say that the regulations are unconstitutional.The argument wasn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re unconstitutional, it&#x27;s that they weren&#x27;t authorized by Congress. To have the law you have to actually pass the law. reply UncleMeat 14 hours agorootparentFirst, \"created in a way outside of the federal government&#x27;s enumerated powers\" is a kind of unconstitutionality.But the argument was bullshit. Major Questions Doctrine just exists to say \"nu uh, that authorization you have from Congress doesn&#x27;t count\" when it is politically expedient. The Clean Air Act exists. Congress passed it. Roberts just thinks that the law shouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything controversial but there is absolutely nowhere in the Constitution that says that Congress&#x27; delegation authority is limited only to uncontroversial things. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparent> First, \"created in a way outside of the federal government&#x27;s enumerated powers\" is a kind of unconstitutionality.It wasn&#x27;t that either. It was the courts saying that the law Congress passed didn&#x27;t clearly authorize the EPA to do this, so if Congress wants it they need to say so unambiguously.Notably this means that to change it doesn&#x27;t require a constitutional amendment but only an ordinary law, which is not what is generally meant by \"unconstitutional\".> The Clean Air Act exists. Congress passed it.And then the courts interpret it and if Congress doesn&#x27;t like their interpretation they can pass a new law which is more specific.> Roberts just thinks that the law shouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything controversial but there is absolutely nowhere in the Constitution that says that Congress&#x27; delegation authority is limited only to uncontroversial things.There is absolutely nowhere in the Constitution that says that Congress even has delegation authority. reply UncleMeat 9 hours agorootparent\"Is unconstitutional\" does not mean \"would require a constitutional amendment to exist.\"Yes, Congress can pass a new law. That doesn&#x27;t make the supreme court&#x27;s decision absolutely fucking rank idiocy based entirely in political goals covered in the thinnest veneer of jurisprudence.Yes, Gorsuch thinks that Congress can&#x27;t delegate at all and basically all execute agencies should be destroyed. We know. He&#x27;ll ride out climate change in a mansion. reply AnthonyMouse 8 hours agorootparent> \"Is unconstitutional\" does not mean \"would require a constitutional amendment to exist.\"It kind of does. Your version would make any interpretation of the law a constitutional question. The plaintiff in a civil case claims they&#x27;re entitled to damages but the court found their argument unconstitutional because it&#x27;s Congress and not plaintiffs who make the law?> That doesn&#x27;t make the supreme court&#x27;s decision absolutely fucking rank idiocy based entirely in political goals covered in the thinnest veneer of jurisprudence.It feels pretty consistent with a \"separation of powers\" interpretation of how laws get made. Do you really think they come to a different result if it was Trump&#x27;s EPA saying they had to replace renewables with \"reliable\" generation methods over whatever pretext? And wouldn&#x27;t that be the result you want?> Yes, Gorsuch thinks that Congress can&#x27;t delegate at all and basically all execute agencies should be destroyed. We know. He&#x27;ll ride out climate change in a mansion.They could exist without making laws. Agency drafts a bill, proposes it to Congress, Congress votes on it. It&#x27;s democratic.It seems like people have forgotten how to compromise. You want a climate change bill, Republicans don&#x27;t.

Its not an oil company issue.> Its not so much they are doing this for profitsFunding a massive climate change denial movement in the US for decades, consequently eating up our limited window of time to make the kinds of societal changes to avoid the worst consequences of climate change is very much an \"oil company issue\" that is done exclusively for profit. reply 14 17 hours agorootparentprevExactly. You me and everyone who drives or consumes basically anything are part of the problem. You can’t put all the blame on them. However where they are to blame is denying the science to the public for years. Had they invested in clean tech years ago we would be much better off. reply MaxHoppersGhost 17 hours agorootparentprevYou probably typed this up on your iPhone while sitting in a polyester&#x2F;plastic chair. I’m guessing you also own&#x2F;drive a car and fly on airplanes. You are the reason these companies produce oil. Oil companies have increased the standard of living for everyone globally, probably saving tens of millions of lives and extending many others. Yes oil companies can be bad actors and we should burn less oil but you’re ignoring all the rest. reply thelock85 17 hours agorootparentRespectfully, this seems like moving the goal posts.Energy companies and governments are best positioned to hedge against future consequences of burning oil. It&#x27;s exactly because we depend on them for a certain standard of living that they can shepherd change, but they serve stock prices not society.It&#x27;s a leadership problem where the actors with the most knowledge and resources to combat the problem can hide behind a version of \"it&#x27;s too big to fail\" and then when it all falls apart leave everyone in the wind. reply davis 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s infeasible and unreasonable to think that in order to criticize and advocate for a change in society, that person needs to be outside of it. Having an iPhone doesn&#x27;t change any of what they are saying.The impact of the plastic material for those products is a fraction of the energy required to make them and run our modern life. Clean power and getting rid of fossil fuels that are burned for energy is the most important thing here. reply DanielVZ 17 hours agorootparentprevNah, it’s the companies that lobby to maximize profit. Cities used to be human scale, but cars took over the streets.Now we know thousands of people die every year in car accidents but it isn’t a priority for governments because freedom to give a shitload of money to oil and car companies matters more than human life. reply tw04 17 hours agorootparentprevNobody said oil was going away entirely. But we&#x27;re well past the point we should still be burning it for locomotion or power. And given what we&#x27;re seeing with microplastics, we should probably be rapidly trying to move back to glass where appropriate for home supplies. reply kyletns 17 hours agorootparentprevNo. The decision of any individual consumer will always be millions of times less impactful than the decisions of the leaders in these organizations. They should be held to account - not the individual buying what they need to get through life. reply MaxHoppersGhost 11 hours agorootparentThe leaders of these organizations are producing oil. That’s not illegal or bad in itself and on the whole petroleum products have made the world a better place by lifting hundreds of millions of people’s living standards and saving&#x2F;extending lives. reply kelseyfrog 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m genuinely curious - what is your account of how the hole in the ozone developed and how the problem was remedied?We&#x27;ll learn a lot about how you view climate crisis by learning about how you think about the ozone crisis. reply esafak 17 hours agorootparentprevPrice in the carbon footprint of these products and see if they&#x27;re still so attractive. reply MaxHoppersGhost 11 hours agorootparentThey will be because they save&#x2F;extend the lives tens of millions of people. reply esafak 10 hours agorootparentThey may save lives but their price will be based on supply and demand and the demand will be based on the price of alternatives. If pricing in the negative externalities causes their price to exceed that of alternatives demand will plummet. reply MaxHoppersGhost 10 hours agorootparentDemand is inelastic for oil so you’ll just end up with inflation. Ordinary people just trying to heat their homes and drive to work will probably be hit the hardest. replyverisimi 2 hours agorootparentprevDo you realise that the Rockerfellers (famous oil scions) organised the environmental movement into what we have today, via people like Maurice Strong (himself an oil entrepreneur).

Renewable energy is still a relatively small fraction of overall energy use, and net global oil consumption has been steadily increasing the past few years (likely to surpass pre-covid levels this year). Our society is still very much addicted to hydrocarbons. reply ff317 20 hours agorootparentI think we&#x27;ll never stop extracting oil in the foreseeable future, we&#x27;ll just be doing a lot less of it. There will always be corner cases where diesel or other oil derivatives (or NG) are the &#x2F;only&#x2F; reasonable option for fuel.Think generators for an antarctic station that can only use solar in certain months and wind isn&#x27;t enough (or reliable enough)). Even if efficient electric commercial aviation at scale ever happens, you can bet military jets will still need jet fuel. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s many others. Methane for rocket launches?On top of fuel, there&#x27;s also the use of some fraction of oil in industrial chemical processes to make lubricants and plastics. There may be other chemical processes that can do it without oil, but they may be too costly (in terms of other extractive processes for ingredients, or in terms of yield, not just energy). reply saalweachter 17 hours agorootparentThe US military uses about 5% of the oil used in the US.That&#x27;s a lot, but if we only used oil in the US for the military, we&#x27;d still be using 95% less oil, and we&#x27;d also still be producing enough oil to have an economy of scale.In any case, realistically speaking, we aren&#x27;t coming for oil tomorrow. Instead, we need to come for coal immediately. If it takes us decades each time we cut our oil consumption in half, that&#x27;s one thing... but the coal, that needs to stop sooner. reply wholien 17 hours agorootparentsomeone needs to tell China, India, Indonesia, Turkey and Zimbabwe> China, India, Indonesia, Turkey and Zimbabwe were the only countries that both added new coal plants and announced new projects. China accounted for 92% of all new coal project announcements.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;world&#x2F;coal-burning-capacity-cli... reply lukeschlather 19 hours agorootparentprevElectricity is probably going to be an order of magnitude (or more) cheaper in 20 years, at least for bulk purchase in most fixed locations (not Antarctic winter.) The assumption that oil extraction is worthwhile is based on it being the cheapest way to get a unit of power. But if power is 1&#x2F;10th what it costs now it is economical to do some process that has absurdly bad efficiency (10:1, even 100:1) to translate power into fuel that works in jets. That might just be making conventional jet fuel. But I doubt we will be extracting it from the ground. reply trashtester 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see any way electricity could fall anywhere near that much in 20 years. For that to happen, we either need a revolutionary decrease in the price of nuclear power, a radical improvement in the price of dependable renewable energy (probably involving a lot of batteries) or some hard AI takeoff that makes EVERYTHING cheaper.Keep in mind that most countries are trying to electrify most parts of the economy, so we not only need to decarbonize the current electrical supply, but possibly 2-3 times that, if we are to replace NG for heating, steel and chemical industries, fertilizers and so on.Keep in mind that even if the technology for producing windmills and batteries go down a lot, we still need a lot of new mining capacity to even have enough raw materials to produce those items. That alone could take 10-15 years to build out. reply marcosdumay 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s actually very likely.As long as you only consume it while the Sun is shinning, at the place of generation. This set of restrictions is allowing enough for a surprisingly large set of industrial applications (anything where energy costs are larger than capital ones).In fact, we are not far from that. Solar is already a few times cheaper than the grid energy on those conditions. reply trashtester 4 hours agorootparentMy post was that electricity prices would come back by a factor of 10 or more. While that was qualified by \"not Antarctic winter\", it did not say that it would be only while the sun was shining, either.That was what I objected to.And if the average price falls by 90%, there number of industrial application where it would make sense to consume only part of the day, drops by a lot. reply vel0city 18 hours agorootparentprevHow do you see electricity getting 10x cheaper in 20 years? It sounds like people saying fission electricity would be too cheap to meter, and yet its some of the most expensive electricity we have in the US. reply dietr1ch 17 hours agorootparenttbf, I think that most new technology has been the most expensive and impractical thing ever around its inception. reply datavirtue 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah, just seeing the axle grease requirements and inventory on an aircraft carrier is a wakeup call. Our military is 110% reliant on oil to even function at all. The economic scale of consumer oil consumption and the petro-dollar are a key military concern to enable warfighting ability. When that sinks in, Iraq and Afghanistan make a lot more sense. reply kjkjadksj 18 hours agorootparentThe US has plenty of oil and didnt need to go to those places to get more of it. We destroyed Iraqs oil pipelines and infrastructure in that war and a lot of it still is in need of investment in reconstruction today. Likewise Afghan oil production is a recent thing like in the last 10 years, and today the taliban government sells those mineral and oil extraction rights to chinese companies. If the goal was to get at those resources for American companies, we clearly failed. It seems China’s belt and road imperialism works better than our bomb the civilians and overthrow the government for a puppet method. reply bryanlarsen 20 hours agorootparentprevGlobal hydrocarbon consumption is down on a per capita basis. And that&#x27;s despite the fact that renewable energy and electric vehicles had a negligible share. It&#x27;s only the last year or two that renewable energy&#x27;s share has become non-negligible. The EV transition is lagging the renewable energy transition, but it&#x27;s happening too. EV&#x27;s now have a non-negligible share of new vehicle sales, but since it takes ~20 years to turn over the global vehicle fleet, they still have a negligible share of the entire fleet. But that&#x27;s changing, very slowly. reply toomuchtodo 20 hours agorootparent> And that&#x27;s despite the fact that renewable energy and electric vehicles had a negligible share.I could not disagree with this more. While China is a \"developing\" country, they are arguably making herculean efforts to move away from oil for transportation. They will drag the developed world along, as they will have built up all of this EV and electric scooter&#x2F;bike&#x2F;moped manufacturing capacity with only so much domestic consumption for it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37307619 (China Reaches Peak Gasoline in Milestone for Electric Vehicles)From the Bloomberg piece:> Earlier this month, Chinese oil giant Sinopec made a surprise announcement that mostly flew under the radar. It’s now expecting gasoline demand in China to peak this year, two years earlier than its previous outlooks. The main culprit? The surging number of electric vehicles on the road.> China has been the largest driver of global growth for refined oil products like gasoline and diesel over the last two decades. But EV adoption rates in China are now soaring, with August figures likely to show plug-in vehicles hitting 38% of new passenger-vehicle sales. That’s up from just 6% in 2020 and is starting to materially dent fuel demand.> Fuel demand in two and three-wheeled vehicles is already in structural decline, with BNEF estimating that 70% of total kilometers traveled by these vehicles already switched over to electric. Fuel demand for cars will be the next to turn, since well over 5% of the passenger-vehicle fleet is now either battery-electric or plug-in hybrid. The internal combustion vehicle fleet is also becoming more efficient due to rising fuel-economy targets. reply bryanlarsen 20 hours agorootparentI said \"had\", past tense. Most numbers still end in 2021, and EV&#x27;s were a negligible fraction of the 1.5 billion vehicles on the road in 2021. Still are, but it&#x27;s changing fast. 6 million EV&#x27;s per year is a huge fraction of one year&#x27;s vehicle sales but a tiny fraction of the entire 1.5 billion fleet. reply toomuchtodo 19 hours agorootparentFair, retracted. Words are hard. Leaving the comment for the datapoints. reply TinyRick 19 hours agorootparentprevPer capita metrics are useless when it comes to climate stats.

And varies widely by locale.EV mileage is reported in eMPG. Which means, \"The miles you get when you charge the battery with the same energy as is in a mile of gasoline.\" The problem is that to deliver that much to the battery, you have losses at the charger, losses in the grid, and losses during power generation. None of which are counted in that figure. If your electric car is running off of a coal power plant, that 120 eMPG Tesla can easily perform about like a 30 MPG Camry. But as soon as you have a significant fraction of your grid being generated by renewables, now the electric car is running on a fraction of the CO2 emissions of the gas car. reply prmoustache 3 hours agorootparentIn the end using a car is using a car. It takes an awful lot of energy to build, and then to move, more so often to transport only one or 2 persons, in a very short trip. It needs huge infrastructure that are energetically and financially costly to build and maintain.All these needs to be cut down and EV won&#x27;t help us. People need to be able to reach safely schools, workplaces, shops, restaurants by foot or by bike regardless of their age and fitness level.What we help us is better infrastructure for non motorized vehicles, better public transport (even if they are not financially profitable), walkable spaces, security (with a density of human presence making sure we are safe, not useless cameras), transforming suburbs, commercial and social areas so there is no physical separation anymore between people and where they need&#x2F;want to go and spend time, effectively bringing back the village&#x2F;small town paradigm.EV goes way way way way down the list and we should focus first on EV for public transport and transportation of good rather than personnal toys and vanity possession. replyp1mrx 18 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electric_car_use_by_countryAre you talking about China?

If extraction is going down, firms won’t invest in developing new resources. This means constraints on supply leading to higher prices. That in turn will drive less consumption (particularly as non-fossil alternatives become mainstream.) There is a potential feedback loop here that drives things towards zero much more rapidly than you might imagine. Anyway, one can hope. reply jsight 17 hours agorootparentThere are also little oddities, such as the impact on gas stations along common commuter routes.

There never is anyone to be held accountable, because everyone who acts is an employee, and the ownership is divided among millions of people, through many layers of misdirection.

You definitely can&#x27;t give it the death penalty and execute it. And it&#x27;s no accident this is the case. The major (and perhaps only real) difference between a corporation and simpler business customs is that the corporation is this magical wall between the owner and the business that can&#x27;t usually be breached. If the business goes bankrupt, no one can seize the businessman&#x27;s home as collateral. That&#x27;s what a corporation is for.

We&#x27;ve done this for cigarettes and it has worked. However, you will probably have the vaping equivalent of petrol that will come out and gain more marketshare.The second solution is to make energy so cheap and abundant that petrol becomes unattractive.To massively and suddenly restrict petrol use is a great way to start riots and ensure that your government will either be overthrown or has to descend into tyranny. reply thworp 19 hours agorootparentI would like to add a point that is rarely spelled out:A shock-therapy style stop to fossil fuel extraction will kill millions of people through starvation, economic collapse and insufficient heating in winter.

Even if we had unlimited fertilizer we&#x27;ve already signed up for massive famine.But if you really want to talk about the unmitigated climate change path, which is what happens if we choose not to keep hydrocarbons in the ground, I really recommend reading Peter Ward&#x27;s Under a Green Sky [2].He&#x27;s a respected geologist that makes a compelling case that the vast majority of mass extinction events were caused by rapid rises in CO2.One of the realistic scenarios we&#x27;re facing, he argues, is the break down of the AMOC ultimately leading to the oceans becoming anoxic and releasing hydrogen sulfide rather than oxygen. The entire marine ecosystem is essentially wiped out except for some cyanobacteria. The oceans are the foundation of all of our food systems. It would make the planet uninhabitable my most complex life of today.

We just don&#x27;t know where the line is for those tipping points.If we seriously want to avoid extinction of the species we should already be starting to strategize a schedule of what fossil fuels reserves we promise to keep in the ground, and what we&#x27;re going to do about future discoveries.To be honest, I don&#x27;t really think we will do this, but if we wanted to survive at all we should start talking about it very seriously. replysgu999 19 hours agorootparentprev> However, you will probably have the vaping equivalent of petrol that will come out and gain more marketshare.I believe that&#x27;s electric SUVs and solar roofs on single family homes :D reply hkt 19 hours agorootparentprevSteel and concrete aren&#x27;t necessary for the most part: other materials that don&#x27;t emit (or even actively sequester) carbon are available and have been for a long, long time.

It does get prohibitively expensive when including every emission, but it&#x27;s not all or nothing, and also, with solar panels reducing the electricity need, a green energy provider covering the grid demand (that&#x27;s the best one can reasonably do after solar panels), etc., it should be possible to reduce the need for carbon capture quite a bit already today, and more in the future as more industries greenify reply Simorgh 19 hours agoparentprevThere is that classic western maxim that evil triumphs when ‘good men do nothing’, but I no longer think this is true.Evil triumphs when ‘good men’s’ efforts fail.Climate change represents an inherent risk to humanity, but some climate change mitigation strategies represent a risk to short-term profit incentives.We are starting to see economic agitation globally as institutions everywhere begin to question the logic of our systems.This and other factors has led us to a multi-polar world, which is itself creating new problems that inhibit global synchronisation on this issue.It is a planetary scale problem.

Anna Ikarashi Twitter Facebook Email An unknown species of early human nearly died out around 900,000 years ago, according to genetic analysis. It may have been both the ancestor of Homo heidelbergensis and a species ancestral to our own.Credit: S. Entressangle/E. Daynes/Science Photo Library Human ancestors in Africa were pushed to the brink of extinction around 900,000 years ago, a study shows. The work1, published in Science, suggests a drastic reduction in the population of our ancestors well before our species, Homo sapiens, emerged. The population of breeding individuals was reduced to just 1,280 and didn’t expand again for another 117,000 years. “About 98.7% of human ancestors were lost,” says Haipeng Li, a population geneticist at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who co-led the study. He says that the fossil record in Africa and Eurasia between 950,000 and 650,000 years ago is patchy and that “the discovery of this bottleneck may explain the chronological gap”. Nick Ashton, an archaeologist at the British Museum in London, who wrote a related perspective2, says he was intrigued by the tiny size of the population. “This would imply that it occupied a very localized area with good social cohesion for it to survive,” he says. “Of greater surprise is the estimated length of time that this small group survived. If this is correct, then one imagines that it would require a stable environment with sufficient resources and few stresses to the system.” Clues from modern-day DNA To make their discovery, the researchers needed to invent new tools. Advances in genome sequencing have improved scientists’ understanding of population sizes for the period after modern humans emerged, but the researchers developed a methodology that enabled them to fill in details about earlier human ancestors. Serena Tucci, an anthropologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, says that such work was sorely needed. “We still know very little about the population dynamics of early human ancestors for several reasons, including methodological limitations and difficulties in obtaining ancient DNA data from old Homo specimens,” she says. The researchers’ method allowed them to reconstruct ancient population dynamics based on genetic data from modern-day humans. By constructing a complex family tree of genes, the team was able to examine the finer branches of the tree with greater precision, identifying significant evolutionary events. The technique “put the spotlight on the period 800,000 to one million years ago — for which there is much unknown — in a way that hasn’t been done before,” says Stanley Ambrose, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This period was part of the Early-Middle Pleistocene transition — a time of drastic climate change, when glacial cycles became longer and more intense. In Africa, this led to long periods of drought. Li says that the changing climate might have wiped out human ancestors and forced new human species to emerge. Eventually, these might have evolved into the last common ancestor of modern humans and our extinct relatives, the Denisovans and Neanderthals. Around 813,000 years ago, the population of pre-humans began to swell again. How our ancestors managed to survive, and what allowed them to flourish once more remains unclear, says Ziqian Hao, a population geneticist at the Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences in Jinan, and a co-author of the paper. However, he says that the bottleneck is likely to have had a crucial impact on human genetic diversity, driving many important features of modern humans, such as brain size. He estimates that up to two-thirds of genetic diversity was lost. “It represents a key period of time during the evolution of humans. So there are many important questions to be answered,” he says. Ashton would like to see the researchers’ findings backed by more archaeological and fossil evidence. The authors “suggest that the bottleneck was a global crash in population,” he says, “but the number of archaeological sites outside Africa suggests that this is not the case. A regional bottleneck might be more likely.” doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02712-4 References Hu, W. et al. Science 381, 979–984 (2023). Article Google Scholar Ashton, N. & Stringer, C.

I haven&#x27;t reviewed the paper or methods but generally their results fit the range of expectations of many in the field.This new paper is interesting in that they developed a new method in population genomics specifically to attempt to pin down all of: the time, the duration, and the size of the population.There are many earlier papers describing different methods for arriving at similar conclusions. The below paper used similar genetic signatures from bottleneck events such as the loss of rare alleles. Their methods were different. It explains one such process fairly well and is available to read:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2842629&#x2F; reply attractivechaos 10 hours agoparent> There are many earlier papers describing different methods for arriving at similar conclusions.The paper under your link is claiming a recent second bottleneck (in addition to the out-of-Africa one at ~60kya) but the Science paper is claiming an ancient bottleneck at ~900kya. These are very different conclusions.Note that the method in the Science paper is unable to find this second bottleneck directly in non-Africans. The authors have to fix recent population sizes to find it. This doesn&#x27;t sound right. The new method is also inconsistent with earlier established methods (disclaimer: one of them is mine) which the authors don&#x27;t have an adequate explanation to.

And one caveat. The requirement is that both individuals need to be free of genetic defects in their alleles, so that no matter how many generations down you go you never end up with two defective alleles in the same descendant. That is impossible in practice. Eventually you would get some diversity from random mutation and at that point you would be back to \"normal\" state of affairs.The caveat is disease resistance. All of their descendants would have the same immune system. If one gets sick, they all do. Any infection will spread like wildfire, if it spreads.

We have just people&#x27;s word, written or not replysomenameforme 6 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s the argument against the seemingly obvious possibility of instead of it being a bottleneck, it was the result of a dominant group? So for the contemporary example, something like 8% of Asian men are related to Genghis Khan [1]. And that&#x27;s in a very recent time frame, and in a world that was already much more spread out than the ones in the distant past.It seems that if there was a group that was particularly dominant (killing competitors, spreading their own genes far and wide), as were their offspring and so on, then it could easily lead to a scenario that would look like a bottleneck due to a surge of a very limited number of individuals taking over a disproportionate dominance of the human gene pool.

It seems to my non-academic brain that each bottleneck would make an ongoing population less likely, as it is an opportunity for the population to die out. So it seems like us having this chat today is evidence that there weren’t too many bottleneck events. The more we would have had, the less likely it would be that humans would have survived until today. 0 bottleneck events seem most likely though that lens, 1 - less likely, 2 - even less, and so on.Right? reply sam0x17 5 hours agorootparentAt minimum you need a breeding pair to keep the population going. That&#x27;s a whole lot less than 1200, so from that macro perspective, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s fairly hard to wipe most things out, especially the things that have made it this far, just like it&#x27;s hard for me to completely get rid of the duckweed that keeps growing in my fish tank. Even if I pluck out all the visible duckweed, there&#x27;s always one or two in the filter that re-seed the population and within a few days the whole surface is covered again. Most life is a little bit like this, to the point where I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very improbable for a species to have bottlenecks. For a species to make it, surviving bottlenecks has to be a defining feature, and for the most part we are exposed to species that make it. reply maxerickson 8 hours agorootparentprevAcceptance of the bottleneck is based on the lack of variation in human DNA.Statistics rather than intuition. reply kqr 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you have a fair coin, and then you toss it ten times and it lands ten heads in a row, that result is no longer unlikely -- it has a probability (in whatever sense that word is now meaningful) of 100 %.You can only judge hypotheses more or less likely in relation to each other. When you have multiple hypotheses that all explain the current situation, one may be more likely to have happened in the past than another. So if all you know is that on the first 20 tosses half were heads, you might say it&#x27;s less likely the sequence was ten heads followed by ten tails, than some mix of heads and tails.But of course, the difficult part is judging whether two hypotheses explain the same outcome. That&#x27;s often somewhat subjective when it comes to historical analyses like these. reply thaumasiotes 10 hours agorootparentprevAs far as I understand it, the bottleneck idea is based on a back-calculation of \"effective population size\" in the past from existing genetic diversity in the present. (This is definitely the case in the article, which specifies \"the population of breeding individuals\".)There are a couple of things that tend to be miscommunicated:1. An effective population size of N means an actual population size that is significantly larger; children too young to reproduce, adults too old to reproduce, and nerds too awkward to reproduce are all not counted in effective population size.2. If a group gets demographically wiped out at time T, their ancestors at time T-1000 vanish from the effective population at time T-1000, even though those same ancestors were part of the effective population at time T-1000 if you did the same calculation at time T-200.(This is true to the extent that the vanishing ancestors don&#x27;t also have other descendants in groups that survive. But the effect is quite significant - the effective size of the pre-Cherokee population in the year 1000 was much larger in the year 1450 than the same quantity, the effective size of the pre-1450-Cherokee population in the year 1000, is today. Was there a bottleneck? Sure; Amerinds in the region of the United States got wiped out. How long did that process take? When did it happen? We know a lot about the shape of the population over the relevant time period - is it something we&#x27;re comfortable calling a \"bottleneck\"?)So we might estimate our group of 1300 effective individuals as reflecting maybe 430 men of reproductive age, 870 women of reproductive age, plus 220 more women of reproductive age who fail to reproduce, 650 more men of reproductive age who fail to reproduce, and a few thousand children and elders not of reproductive age.

Something like one extra meter per second in maximum speed does not seem to give enough advantage over competing predators. reply gumby 10 hours agorootparentprevOr, more likely, at one point a mutation, or a group of mutations, gave rise to a small number of super-cheetahs that interbred, and those cheetahs completely out-competed all other cheetahs until the remaining standard cheetahs, that had been enslaved rebelled under the cheetah Spartacus, overwhelming and eradicating the super-cheetahs using the super-cheetah&#x27;s own aircraft and other weapons, though even in victory leaving only a small number of normal ones to continue the species.Ockham&#x27;s razor says my scenario is more likely. reply dredmorbius 8 hours agorootparentThere do seem to be some evolutionary branch points in which a single occurrence of a mutation or adaptation seems to have proven overwhelmingly successful.The one I&#x27;m most familiar with is of the integration of mitochondria into eukaryotic cells.

It wasn&#x27;t a proposal that humans lived in the water, merely that:> My thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, shell fish, sea-urchins etc., in the shallow waters off the coast. I suppose that they were forced into the water just as we have seen happen in so many other groups of terrestrial animals. I am imagining this happening in the warmer parts of the world, in the tropical seas where Man could stand being in the water for relatively long periods, that is, several hours at a stretch.[1]So, wading hunter-gatherers.In this - as an primarily land based creature - wading seems reasonably effective.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aquatic_ape_hypothesis reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentYes, and that&#x27;s exactly what makes the hypothesis so unlikely, all this immense adaptation for something that seems to come more-or-less for free with a standard mammalian body plan. The timescales we&#x27;re talking about for such invasive changes would be far longer than available for the whole of the aquatic ape hypothesis, but is recent enough that there should be plenty of fossil evidence. I just don&#x27;t buy it, but if ever someone digs up fossil proof I&#x27;ll be happy to eat a hat or two. It is roughly in line for me with &#x27;Hollow Earth&#x27; and &#x27;Water as a fuel&#x27;. It smacks of backwards reasoning and wishful thinking.But: it&#x27;s harmless and whoever wants to believe in it is obviously welcome to do so. reply mullingitover 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not proof, but it is evidence. It&#x27;s not a smoking gun but at the same time, there are other peculiarities that line up with aquatic-ness: the hairlessness, the extensive subcutaneous fat, the breath control, the descended larynx, the swimming reflex. None of them on their own is proof, but combined they&#x27;re difficult to hand-wave away. They&#x27;re each traits that are very out of place in terrestrial mammals, and at the same time very normal in aquatic mammals. reply jacquesm 9 hours agorootparentI think they&#x27;re all just super useful to have in a world where 2&#x2F;3rds consists of water even if you predominantly live on the land. Note that there is no driving force behind any of this other than dumb selection and mutation and that it would be very strange to first lose all this stuff upon emerging from the sea but still living predominantly in coastal areas (as we still do today!) and then to re-acquire those traits over a relatively short period of time because suddenly they are pre-requisites for survival. Much easier to take them along for the ride where they are handy all the time, as evidenced by many other mammals that have all of these (and sometimes more).But you&#x27;re right in that in theory it could have happened and like any essentially unfalsifiable theory it will likely remain that way.It&#x27;s funny because depending on which field we&#x27;re looking at I probably have my own &#x27;aquatic apes&#x27; based on how solid I think a particular theory is but without dedicating a lifetime to it I&#x27;ll just take the easy way out and align with the largest body of scientists until there is hard proof to the contrary.

It just means that those 1200 individuals are the only ones that have contributed genes to the gene pool that survives today. There could have been other human populations that did not pass on their genetic material to modern humans, but were the same species as those who did. In fact, there could have been a lot of them. There were many different hominid species alive at that time, and humans were in competition with them. We have no idea of their relative number. It could have been millions for all we know.Absent any other evidence, a population bottleneck (derived through studies of live human DNA) suggests nothing about the population at the time, or over time.Survivor bias. reply daveguy 11 hours agoparentYes. The number of breeding pairs present at one time could have coincided with a large population of human-like creatures that went extinct.The key point in your phrasing is: \"There were many different hominid species alive at that time, and humans were in competition with them.\"If humpback whales eventually become extinct and blue whales eventually dominate global ecosystems we aren&#x27;t going to say that means blue whales didn&#x27;t experience a near extinction because \"hey! plenty of whale-critters\".A minimal number of breeding pairs is the definition of near-extinction. To imply otherwise is misleading.Homo-sapiens is not the same as Homo-neanderthalensis. reply titzer 11 hours agorootparentEven then, there could have been many breeding pairs of humans that were alive and operating and their descendants just did not survive until today. As I wrote in my comment, it doesn&#x27;t actually say that the population was 1280 individuals, just that some 1280 individual subset of the population passed on their genetic material to us. The descendants of the rest could have died out at any point between now and that time. reply daveguy 11 hours agorootparentOkay. That&#x27;s a valid hypothesis. Genetic information from only 1280 identified alive during this particular time seems evidentiary of a low population during a specific time more than something that \"just happened\". For instance, if the 8 billion alive today only propagated through 1280 alive sometime in the future you would expect a near extinction event to be the cause (we know near extinction and extinction aren&#x27;t particularly rare). Is there evidence that it just happened to be 1280 from a thriving population of hundreds of thousands or millions?Edit: otherwise I&#x27;m not sure you can claim the hypothesis that a near extinction bottleneck is somehow more \"misleading\" than it was something that \"just happened\" to appear as a common event among species.

It cuts off contact with all the other islands. From this point on, everyone born on that island is a descendant of only the thousand people living on that island, instead of intermingling with the neighboring islands over time, but there&#x27;s still a million people.Then, one generation, they go to war. They swim to a neighboring island, kill everyone there, and take it over, and then divide themselves between the two islands. The population drops from 1 million to 999,000. Over time, they expand to fill the two islands, and the population rises back to 1 million.A hundred years later, they decide they need another island, so they swim to a third island, kill everyone there, and repeat.Bit by bit, over the course of a hundred thousand years, the descendants of the original xenophobic island swim to each of the other thousand islands, kill everyone there, and repopulate.In the genetic record, you have a bottleneck -- everyone descends from this small starting population. In the historic record, you just have a gradual pattern of migration and genocide. At no point does the population drop much below the original million; at no point does the population of pre-humans \"almost go extinct\". reply sally_glance 11 hours agorootparentGreat write-up! I wonder if it would be possible to enumerate all possible scenarios like this and assign probabilities to them.For example in the scenario described here, I&#x27;d expect the probability it actually occured to be pretty low given that the geographical facts (the world is not made of small islands) and the archeological findings (no mass graves that can be assigned to a periodic timeline) don&#x27;t line up.Maybe I&#x27;m just not creative enough but somehow I feel there can&#x27;t be that many different scenarios and most of them should be easily falisifieable&#x2F;verifiable. reply saalweachter 10 hours agorootparentYou could imagine sociological divide instead of a physical one; a proto-religion that forbade and punished associating with outsiders, for instance. reply sally_glance 10 hours agorootparentNice, so that&#x27;s another scenario. Not sure if we should rank it higher in terms of probability though - at some point they would either have had to survive some catastrophe while all others died (basically the bottleneck scenario?) or go out and kill all the others (no archeological evidence). reply saalweachter 9 hours agorootparentI mean, the archaeological record of 900k years ago is pretty sparse. reply bryanlarsen 10 hours agorootparentprevAccording to the article, that bottleneck lasted for 100,000 years. So in your scenario, the ancestor island cuts themselves off for 100,000 years before starting the extermination.Also the time period of the bottleneck corresponds with a hole in the archaeological record.So while your thought experiment is possible, a bottleneck is more plausible. reply saalweachter 10 hours agorootparentI think there&#x27;s actually a really trivial modification for that: every thousand years or so, one of the colonizer islands decides the other colonizers are impure, cuts itself off, and begins the cycle all over again. reply daveguy 6 hours agorootparentprevWow. That is a very powerful thought experiment. Is there any evidence that a series of very slow non-comingling death marauders. Took over a population of one million vs there just being a dangerous few individuals at one point? I feel like we haven&#x27;t seen successful slow march death marauders more often than low populations. reply totetsu 9 hours agorootparentprevBut have humans ever been able to pillage without the r**? reply titzer 11 hours agorootparentprevExactly! reply borissk 11 hours agorootparentprevThis bottleneck occurred before the split between \"us\" and neanderthals - so if this small population didn&#x27;t survive there wouldn&#x27;t be not only modern humans, but neanderthals as well. reply daveguy 11 hours agorootparentAhh, yes. Good point. Neanderthals wasn&#x27;t a good example. The ones that didn&#x27;t survive from that point would have been called something else. reply asdff 11 hours agoparentprevThe number is also referring to effective population size vs the true population size which is larger. For reference the effective population size today is estimated to be between 10,000-20,000 individuals.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu&#x2F;bionumber.aspx?s=n&v=0&id... reply dang 11 hours agoparentprev(We&#x27;ve replaced the article title with its subtitle, which is more specific.) reply borissk 11 hours agoparentprevIMHO you&#x27;re only partially correct. The population of our ancestors was larger before and after the bottleneck. And it&#x27;s a very important event, no doubt modern human genetics and behavior is influenced by it. reply lainga 12 hours agoprevThe romantic optimist in me will keep some hope out that that sort of thing was the Great Filter which felled so many of our unseen galactic neighbours. reply api 12 hours agoparentThe Great Filter is really just an arbitrary speculation since we don&#x27;t know most of the parameters in the Drake equation with any certainty.It&#x27;s also a fallacy to assume that a great filter, if it exists, must be a single discrete climactic test or have a single explanation. It could be that there exists on average a continuous low probability of an event or evolutionary path that rules out advanced intelligence in a given biosphere.Let&#x27;s say that the yearly probability of such a terminal event or path is about 0.00000002%. Over 500 million years this would amount to a 99% chance of failing the great filter.If this is true it would mean that we&#x27;re almost there, very likely to succeed, but also very likely pretty alone at least in our galaxy since there won&#x27;t be that many advanced intelligences around.The difference though is that unlike the discrete great filter hypothesis there is no single apocalyptic event to fear. It&#x27;s a small probability spread over aeons.This is just to show that we don&#x27;t know the answer to the Fermi paradox at all. There&#x27;s no testable or scientific answer at least. Only way to really know is to go out there and look around. reply borissk 11 hours agorootparentThere may be 99% chance of failing the great filter in the 500M years before an industrial evolution and 99.99999999% chance of failing it in the 10K years past. Humankind invented nuclear weapons and had a lot of luck that they are hard to make and so far only 2 were used in anger. There&#x27;s a good chance that with the progress of AI, nanotech, CRISPR very powerful weapons will become available to groups like ISIS - greatly decreasing humankind&#x27;s chances of survival. reply api 11 hours agorootparentWe just don’t know.At this point for all we know the birth of life is just unbelievably improbable and rare and that’s it. reply kgeist 4 hours agoprevDoes it suggest all languages stem from a single proto-language after all?

To estimate \"1280 individuals\" is... very precise. reply RoyalHenOil 12 hours agoparentThis is the number supported by DNA evidence. There will be a margin of error.The bigger issue, for me, is that I&#x27;m not sure how they can rule out the possibility that there were lots of other people around at that time whose lineages gradually died out. Modern genetic lineages may trace back to 1280 people (+&#x2F;- the margin of error), but it seems pretty dubious to assume that those were the only people living at that time. It seems highly likely to me that there were infertile people, people who died young, people whose only living children were infertile or died young, etc.(I did not read the original paper, so maybe they accounted for this, or maybe they that specify that this was a genetic bottle neck for modern humans, but not necessarily the actual size of the population.) reply jltsiren 11 hours agorootparent\"1280 people\" is just a misleading simplification early in the linked article. Both the news article and the original paper speak of 1280 breeding individuals.Also, the way population dynamics work, lineages tend to die out quickly or not at all. Isolated populations can die out gradually, but it takes exceptional circumstances for a population to survive in the long term while remaining isolated. reply svnt 12 hours agorootparentprevThere is a minimum in the fossil record at that time. There may be other explanations for it, but one very reasonable one is that there just weren&#x27;t very many skeletons to potentially fossilize. reply RoyalHenOil 11 hours agorootparentCertainly. However, I am still highly doubtful that there were only 1280 people alive at that time. I&#x27;m not sure that this is what the article is claiming; however, it is written in a way that makes it very easy to come away with that message (as evidenced in this comment section).What are the chances that every person alive today, for example, will still have living descendants in 400,000 years? If people 400,000 years in the future do a genetic study on themselves to determine how many of their ancestors were alive in the year 2023, what percentage of the 2023 population will they be able to account for? My guess is a fair bit lower than 100%. reply postmodest 11 hours agorootparentprev\"there were lots of other people around at that time whose lineages gradually died out\"It seems to me that if those lineages aren&#x27;t in the DNA data, then they didn&#x27;t --in the intervening years-- intermix with the lineages in the DNA data.So, ipso facto, those lineages went extinct, and the 1280 ancestors posited in the study are the non-extinct lineages. QED. reply RoyalHenOil 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s correct.Now, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they were isolated from each other, however. If we suppose that the population was actually 5000 people (just an example; I have no idea if this is a realistic number), then some percentage of those people died with having children, some may have seen their children die, etc. Of the 1280 people who still have living descendants, many of them would have had children with those people who did not, but those children (or grandchildren, etc.) eventually did not have any children themselves.Within your own social circle, you likely know some people who will still have living descendant generations from now and some who will not. reply suoduandao2 10 hours agorootparentprevIf those lines died out from intertribal competition though, it wasn’t a near-extinction era. Some slightly less competitive group could have made it into the present day in that case. reply Roboprog 12 hours agorootparentprevExactly: it&#x27;s really hard to tell if \"the environment\" took out the other hominids, or if the descendants of the 1280 took them out.\"Hmm, this monkey looking thing isn&#x27;t as tasty as a wooly mammoth, but it&#x27;ll do.\"(it&#x27;s not like chimps don&#x27;t catch and eat other primates) reply sidfthec 12 hours agorootparentprev> I did not read the original paper, so maybe they accounted for thisThen why say it&#x27;s an issue? reply RoyalHenOil 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s an issue with the research. It&#x27;s very likely the researchers thought of this.It IS an issue with the article linked here, since it does not explain the research and causes readers to walk away believing there were only 1280 people. reply fooker 12 hours agorootparentprevThey haven&#x27;t. reply psychphysic 12 hours agoparentprevThe estimate is the estimate (1280 with SEM of 131).It&#x27;s be foolish of them to mask it intentionally.Once independent estimates are made then you might synthesize an reasonable estimate.Both the editor summary I&#x27;m science and the headline here don&#x27;t place much emphasis on the precise number. reply adhesive_wombat 12 hours agorootparentThe actual linked article isn&#x27;t the paper, and doesn&#x27;t even name the paper as far I can tell, it&#x27;s just given as \"Hu, W. et al.

What animals were around, what sort of animals we hunted and sought after. How communities were formed and how we were able to safely breed.
