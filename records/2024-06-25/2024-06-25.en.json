Reilly and Patrick Smith WASHINGTON — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was released from a British prison and on his way to a remote Pacific island on Tuesday where he will plead guilty to a conspiracy charge as part of a plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department, according to court documents. The agreement will free Assange and end the yearslong legal battle over the publication of a trove of classified documents. Assange was charged by criminal information — which typically signifies a plea deal — with conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defense information, the court documents said. Wikileaks posted footage to X of Assange boarding a plane at Stanstead Airport near London at 5 p.m. (12 p.m. ET) on Monday. A letter from Justice Department official Matthew McKenzie said Assange would appear in court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S.-controlled territory north of Guam, at 9 a.m. local time Wednesday (7 p.m. ET Tuesday) to plead guilty. A plane believed to be carrying Assange landed early Tuesday in the Thai capital Bangkok to refuel. He will later arrive for what could be a final court hearing after spending five years in a British jail.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that \"the case has dragged on for too long, there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia.\" Assange's mother, Christine Assange, said in a statement widely reported by Australian media: \"I am grateful that my son’s ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy.\" His wife, Stella Assange, is currently in Australia with the couple's two children, aged 5 and 7, waiting for his arrival, she told BBC Radio 4. \"He will be a free man once it is signed off by a judge,\" she said, adding that she wasn't sure the deal would happen until the last 24 hours. She said she was \"elated.\" Stella Assange, a lawyer, also told the Reuters news agency that she would seek a pardon on her husband's behalf. She said that accepting a guilty plea on an espionage charge created a \"very serious concern\" for journalists across the world. U.S. charges against Assange stem from one of the largest publications of classified information in American history, which took place during President Barack Obama's first term. Starting in late 2009, according to the government, Assange conspired with Chelsea Manning, a military intelligence analyst, to use his WikiLeaks website to disclose tens of thousands of activity reports about the war in Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands of reports about the war in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and assessment briefs of detainees at the U.S. detention camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Court documents revealing Assange's plea deal were filed Monday evening in U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. Assange was expected to appear in that court and to be sentenced to 62 months, with credit for time served in British prison, meaning he would be free to return to Australia, where he was born. “This was an independent decision made by the Department of Justice and there was no White House involvement in the plea deal decision,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement Monday evening. Assange has been held in the high-security Belmarsh Prison in east London for five years, and he previously spent seven years in self-exile at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London — where he reportedly fathered two children — until his asylum was withdrawn and he was forcibly carried out of the embassy and arrested in April 2019. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange walking to board a plane from London Stansted Airport on Monday.Wikileaks via AFP - Getty Images A superseding indictment was returned more than five years ago, in May 2019, and a second superseding indictment was returned in June 2020. Assange has been fighting extradition for more than a decade: first in connection with a sex crimes case in Sweden that was eventually dropped, then in connection with the case against him in the United States. In March, the High Court in London gave him permission for a full hearing on his appeal as he sought assurances that he could rely upon the First Amendment at a trial in the U.S. In May, two judges on the High Court said he could have a full hearing on whether he would be discriminated against in the U.S. because he is a foreign national. A hearing on the issue of Assange's free speech rights had been scheduled for July 9-10. WikiLeaks also published hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee that upended the 2016 presidential race. Russian intelligence officers were subsequently indicted in connection with the hacking in 2018 in a case brought by then-special counsel Robert Mueller. At a joint news conference with then-President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin days later, Trump contradicted the indictment and the intelligence community, saying Putin was \"extremely strong and powerful in his denial\" that Russians interfered in the 2016 election to help him win. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison, but Obama commuted her sentence in the final days of his presidency in 2017. Manning was subsequently held in contempt of court for nearly a year after she refused to answer questions for a grand jury; she was then released after an attempted suicide.

He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1901 days there. He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stanstead airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK. This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations. This created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal that has not yet been formally finalised. We will provide more information as soon as possible. After more than five years in a 2x3 metre cell, isolated 23 hours a day, he will soon reunite with his wife Stella Assange, and their children, who have only known their father from behind bars. WikiLeaks published groundbreaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions. As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles,and for the people's right to know. As he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom. Julian's freedom is our freedom.

I am happy he's finally going to be free but I am still in deep sadness because this is not the world we are supposed to living in. With all of our knowledge and technology we are still doing horrible things as a civilization and we have lost control of our leadership. This scares me a lot because it is a growing problem and every day it seems like humanity is losing more and more of itself to evil and greedy powers that be. Assange did a great thing by exposing corrupt and criminal behavior at the highest levels and got such a inhumane treatment from the most powerful organizations on earth. He should not have been punished, he should have been protected and praised and his case should be a matter of study on every school on earth. reply jfax 1 hour agoparentThis is beautifully articulated. I myself thought for a long time that if the day ever came that Assange walks free, I'd cry, but instead I feel a strange emptiness inside. The world isn't the one I'd imagined for this day. reply tootie 26 minutes agoparentprevRead some Steven Pinker. Your observations about our present state are not wrong, but seriously consider every other point in human history and realize we are not worse off in any measurable way. In fact, much better. reply meroes 48 minutes agoparentprevI’m genuinely not sure if we are in different bubbles or just different. How can you be pure toward him when he is fine getting informants and others killed, and asking for and telling how to go about getting classified info. Are the facts in dispute? I reserve judgment on whether it was ultimately moral to do what he did until all the facts are known, which might be never. You seem to know a different set of facts or have very different judgments. I wonder which and if, with the same facts, how you come to such thoughts. To me purity towards Assange seems like willful ignorance or some kind of “ends justify the means”. But the means are lives and conspiracy to steal+spread classified info, and determining such a moral quandary should be hard, no? Purity of admiration seems impossible with these givens, so what’s going on? reply Draiken 21 minutes agorootparentI'm unsure where the purity claim comes from. Parent said people should praise him for his actions. Nowhere it's stated ALL his actions, or that he is pure in any way, shape or form. Nobody is perfect and he's no different, all that they're expressing is that making the hard moral choice to expose bad behavior should be applauded instead of punished. I know the vast majority of us (including me) would not have the courage to risk personal retaliation to expose bad behavior. We all love to think we would, but we all witness corruption everywhere and never say a word for a plethora of reasons. If they were claiming \"purity\" as you imply, I'd agree. But that's not what was written, and it seems a lot of people have the same flawed interpretation. Yes, he's flawed, but that doesn't make what he has done any less brave. reply segasaturn 24 minutes agorootparentprevI don't understand why Assange should be treated more harshly for putting people's theoretical lives at risk than the people who were actually murdering civilians and committing war crimes? reply hartator 36 minutes agorootparentprevRevealing war crimes easily qualified for declassification of government documents. It’s a straightforward of course the end justified the means situation reply user3939382 41 minutes agorootparentprev> he is fine getting informants and others killed The US testified in court that his disclosures didn't get anyone killed, this is misinformation stemming from early propaganda against him by the political establishment that was humiliated by WikiLeaks' publications reply meroes 38 minutes agorootparent“Well, they're informants,\" Assange replied. \"So, if they get killed, they've got it coming to them. They deserve it.\" The US’s testimony makes it barely better given the quote (I’ll take your word for the testimony) and leaves me equally puzzled regarding his admiration. reply consumer451 59 minutes agoprevHe should not have spent all of this time being persecuted by the US government, but he should have been ostracized by the public long ago. I believe that if not for the prior, the latter would have occurred much more readily. > A reporter worried that Assange would risk killing Afghans who had co-operated with American forces if he put US secrets online without taking the basic precaution of removing their names. \"Well, they're informants,\" Assange replied. \"So, if they get killed, they've got it coming to them. They deserve it.\" A silence fell on the table as the reporters realised that the man the gullible hailed as the pioneer of a new age of transparency was willing to hand death lists to psychopaths. They persuaded Assange to remove names before publishing the State Department Afghanistan cables. But Assange's disillusioned associates suggest that the failure to expose \"informants\" niggled in his mind. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/18/julian... reply TeeMassive 9 minutes agoparentThe sources are out of context quotes coming from hear say sources; those sources being clearly politically motivated think tanks. reply Log_out_ 45 minutes agoparentprevDidn't know that and yes, that is condemning.

The government enforcement usually includes a gag order prohibiting the target from saying that they're under orders, so the intent is that you can infer government gag pressure by the canary having been removed. Wikileaks used to have such a notice and no longer does, so we assume government enforcement is why. reply benreesman 13 hours agoparentI remember when canaries were useful as a deterrent: even with an apathetic public on balance the tech community was pretty vigilant.

Ten years ago it was a scandal that big tech interacted with the surveillance state at all: Zuckerberg drove an initiative around cross-DC encryption at ruinous expense because of the mere accusation that the NSA might have a tap.

Never understood why gag orders don't just say \"You can't say you received this order. Oh and by the way if we find you removed a canary, we'll just write that up as you having said you received this order\". Because the point of a canary is for it to be known beforehand. So the government surely knows about any canary too. There must be some backwards definition of \"speech\" here which doesn't include all conveying of information (such as by removing previously published information), which makes it work, at least in the US (?) reply pcl 10 hours agorootparentThe typical canary contains a signed timestamp. Generally, the US does differentiate between forbidding an action (“do not remove your canary”) and compelling an action (“update your canary with a new timestamp” or “disclose the pass phrase for the signing key”). I’m no expert, and I’m sure there are nuances, but the broad strokes behind the design of these canaries are that it’s harder for the government to compel an action than to forbid one. reply adammarples 3 hours agorootparentprevThe whole point of a canary is that it's passive, and for exactly that reason.

We argue semantics around incidents like this when it comes down to: people doing bad stuff and trying to hide it. If anything, these laws are completely broken. People should never be punished for exposing bad actors, period. Imagine if that ever happened. Maybe governments and companies would think twice before acting illegally/immorally. Governments do not want these incidents to happen because they want to keep doing it in secrecy and they enact laws to make uncovering these schemes illegal. Arguing if that's illegal or not is missing the whole point. It will never be legal in a corrupt society like ours. reply colechristensen 5 hours agorootparentprevHe has agreed to plead guilty to violating the Espionage Act, it's no longer an argument, he's admitting it in court.

This is the same country that just agreed to let him plead guilty in exchange for, essentially, time served (~5 years). It's also the same country whose president commuted Chelsea Manning's sentence down to 7 years. Your basic claim is not an unreasonable one: people plead guilty because they'd rather take the deal than face the possibility of a worse outcome at trial. But what will it take to stop the rhetoric about the U.S. wanting to lock him up and throw away the key? reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentIt's also the same country that agreed to it only after it became clear that there was a real chance they might suffer the embarrassment of not getting an extradition and/or have to deal with a government after the election come the July 4 election that might - despite how I dislike Starmer - be at least somewhat less receptive to US pressure. > It's also the same country whose president commuted Chelsea Manning's sentence down to 7 years. The same country who may have a different president come November with a history of calling the Assange case a priority. Why would anyone feel safe relying on the luck of the draw of the president at any given time to get out of what was an initial utterly extreme sentence? > But what will it take to stop the rhetoric about the U.S. wanting to lock him up and throw away the key? When the US stops sentencing people to 35 years like with Chelsea Manning's initial sentence, and there's been a long period without e.g. illegal rendition flights, when Guantanamo Bay has been closed for a few decades and no new camps have taken it's place etc. Maybe when a couple of generations have passed, in other words. reply tremon 23 minutes agorootparentprevBut what will it take to stop the rhetoric about the U.S. wanting to lock him up and throw away the key?

You'll find yourself looking back wistfully on the days of the Pax Americana, which for nearly 80 years has maintained a flawed but workable rules-based international order.

The US hegemony is flawed but: 1. There is no other country (not even close) that could be trusted with that amount of power (especially considering size) 2. Held up the (illusion of) “neutral” international institutions like the UN. They barely worked in the presence of a “benevolent” power, and will probably completely lose relevance to anarchy and the “right of the stronger” (on local levels), shall the US hegemony subside. Then on the other hand the US has started undermining their own most important principles: 1. 1971: Removing the gold convertability from the $ 2. 9/11: Starting to spy on each and everyone, eastern germany/soviet-style 3. Removing personal freedoms during COVID (not as severe as other countries, though) If it weren’t for silicon valley, the us would already look like a stagnating state where the economy is mainly driven by government spending. The problem is larping EU socialism will only yield even worse results in the US, since the government seems to be even less efficient.

If you look at the totality of the BBC's coverage, it's clear that the general consensus is that he did a good thing for humanity that hurt some powerful people, and he's been unjustly punished for it, but that there is a small cohort of people (including some very vocal, powerful ones who get headlines) who disagree with that opinion and think that he did something negative and was justly punished for it. The trouble is that when you summarise that argument, you lose the \"general consensus\" and \"small cohort\" bits and you just get the two points, which together make a rather different story. reply smsm42 16 minutes agorootparentprev> do not see Assange as a journalist.

You seem to be really badly misunderstanding this specific passage: >\"Shamir was also a longtime friend of Julian Assange, who tasked him with helping to disseminate WikiLeaks documents in his native Russia in early 2010. >“Shamir has a years-long friendship with Assange, and was privy to the contents of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables months before WikiLeaks made public the full cache,” James Ball, a former WikiLeaks staffer, wrote at the Guardian the next year. “Shamir aroused the suspicion of several WikiLeaks staffers — myself included — when he asked for access to all cable material concerning ‘the Jews,’ a request which was refused.” >The first thing Shamir did with the documents was hand some off to Russian Reporter magazine, a Kremlin-friendly newsweekly.\" I.e. Shamir, a Wikileaks employee, had access to some leaked US diplomatic cables. He was refused additional access. No contradiction. This is also the only time that Assange's early relationship with Shamir was ever mentioned (read the article for yourself, find where I'm wrong) and note how it mentions leaking US documents in Russia. There is no mention anywhere in the article of Shamir \"leaking Russian documents in Russia\", or what Assange \"first contacted\" Shamir for.

You could have stated this very differently instead of using sarcasm and we might have agreed on some points, but \"is an odd way of saying\" is so unnecessary. Did you read the article? You may find quite a bit to agree with. I personally have a pretty low opinion of Assange, and the article talks quite a bit about his narcissistic tendencies. Your language also doesn't allow for the fact that although his actions might have helped Russian intelligence, it may well not be that he sat down at some point and explicitly said \"right, how can I help the Russian government?\" There's some fantastic literature about how well-meaning people can get dragged in some terrible directions, like Into That Darkness about Franz Stangl, the commandant at Treblinka.

It's easy to blame one entity or another for these sorts of upset events, but national elections are media circuses largely run by private spending on the terms of private parties and blaming any one party seems like missing the forest for the trees. Again, election \"interference\" is not unfamiliar ground for democracies or republics, liberal or classic, so it confuses me why people blame the electorate rather than the flaws in our implementation of democratic ideals (eg the citizens united ruling) that allowed private capital to run rampant over our election mechanics. To illustrate how inevitable this is, the roman republic had statute stipulating the width of the halls leading up to the ballots to physically restrict voters from being harassed or intimidated. Otherwise the richer candidate would simply pay a mob to physically bully you into voting a certain way regardless of your original intentions—or perhaps they might outright buy your vote out if they knew which way your ballot cast. It was completely understood by all involved that voting (& armies) could be bought with sufficient money and ingenuity by even single people.

Let's see what 4th July brings. At least it'll be the end of the current horrorshow. reply Closi 10 hours agorootparentGoing 'full left' is the exact reason Labour hasn't been in power for 14 years. You are describing the recipe for a one-term government IMO - Elections are won from the center, and moving Left will open a center gap for someone else to claim. The last time a 'full left' Labour government ruled was probably just after the war (i.e. Clement Attlee). reply vidarh 9 hours agorootparentFirstly Labour went mildly social democratic, offering policies to the right of Nordic conservative parties in some areas. Just to contextualise what \"full left\" means in this respect. (A concrete example is parental leave, where the Norwegian conservative party is fine with far higher statutory pay than Labour would even dare suggest even under Corbyn) Secondly, I see this, but at the same time Corbyn was the most vilified politician in the UK in a generation and he still got close to a win with that program. Suppose Corbyn could do that at a point where the Tories were not historically unpopular. In that case, it's clear Starmer could have stuck to his pledges to be \"pragmatic continuity Corbyn\" and walked this election - most of the actual policies in the 2017 manifesto were highly popular when polled, including with conservative voters. reply dmje 7 hours agorootparentAgree. I mean - from my point of view there are two glaring issues in this election that are just being coughed aside in a deeply disingenuous way, by all parties (with maybe the exception of the LibDems, a bit): 1) Brexit. For this not to be on the agenda when it has been the most ruinous decision made in the last 10 years of our political history is just ...well, weird at best, totally surreal at worst. Widely recognised [even by many? most?] of those who voted for it as now being a mistake, it just seems insane to leave any discussion off the table. 2) Tax rises. Everyone knows that for our UK standard of living to continue (or even - lol - rise), the money has got to come from somewhere. And that place can only really be taxes. All of the parties seem to be pulling out a magic hat full of magic money - an honest conversation would have all the parties in a room agreeing that someone, somewhere has got to pay for all this stuff.

I disagree with Starmer on a lot but he's right to totally shut down discussion on this until after an election reply n4r9 6 hours agorootparentprevJust to put this in context, the last time as you say a \"full left\" government ruled, over the span of six years we: - Built the NHS - Decolonised India, Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, and Jordan - Nationalised the coal industry, electricity utilities, railways and long-distance haulage - Established a national childcare service - Paved the way for the creation of National Parks and introduced public rights of way There is a lot of progress that can be made with a genuine left-wing government with a majority, even in a time of economic upheaval.

I'd ask you to consider that the situations in Syria and Ukraine are not nearly as straightforward as the US would have us believe; indeed, the US and Israel are, as usual, the main instigators. Regardless, Corbyn hasn't \"crossed any lines\" - he certainly hasn't publicly stated that it's OK to cut a civilian population's water supply as collective punishment, for example. Corbyn takes a more considered, nuanced, sensible view on world politics, which unfortunately doesn't play well with our right-wing press's simplistic \"good guy, bad guy\" gov-sponsored narrative.

And so I think even with a guilty please, there ought to be a requirement for the prosecution to prove the case. Maybe lower the bar a little bit, but not much.

Few jurisdictions have US-style plea bargains where the prosecutor can negotiate large \"discounts\" to the potential maximum sentencing and get judges to agree. To me, a country that allows that and where they are frequently taken does not have a functioning justice system. There's also a significant difference with respect to the coercion when sentences are long, and when the possible variation in sentence length is huge, and the US stands out as particularly bad with respect to both of those factors as well. reply rand846633 9 hours agorootparentprevDid the US army or its participating individuals ever get charged for killing the “collateral murder” Reuters journalists?

    "originBody": "Local, first, forever So I was at the Local-First Conf the other day, listening to Martin Kleppmann, and this slide caught my attention: Specifically, this part: But first, some context. What is local-first? For the long version, go to Ink & Switch, who coined the term. Or listen for Peter van Hardenberg explaining it on LocalFirst.fm. Here’s my short version: It’s software. That prefers keeping your data local. But it still goes to the internet occasionally to sync with other users, fetch data, back up, etc. If it doesn’t go to the internet at all, it’s just local software. If it doesn’t work offline with data it already has, then it’s just normal cloud software. You all know the type — sorry, Dave, I can’t play the song I just downloaded because your internet disappeared for one second... But somewhere in the middle — local-first. We love it because it’s good for the end user, you and me, not for the corporations that produce it. What’s the problem with local-first? The goal of local-first software is to get control back into the hands of the user, right? You own the data (literally, it’s on your device), yada-yada-yada. That part works great. However, local-first software still has this online component. For example, personal local-first software still needs to sync between your own devices. And syncing doesn’t work without a server... So here we have a problem: somebody writes local-first software. Everybody who bought it can use it until the heat death of the universe. They own it. But if the company goes out of business, syncing will stop working. And companies go out of business all the time. What do we do? Cue Dropbox The solution is to use something widely available that will probably outlive our company. We need something popular, accessible to everyone, has multiple implementations, and can serve as a sync server. And what’s the most common end-user application of cloud sync? Dropbox! Well, not necessarily Dropbox, but any cloud-based file-syncing solution. iCloud Drive, OneDrive, Google Drive, Syncthing, etc. It’s perfect — many people already have it. There are multiple implementations, so if Microsoft or Apple go out of business, people can always switch to alternatives. File syncing is a commodity. But file syncing is a “dumb” protocol. You can’t “hook” into sync events, or update notifications, or conflict resolution. There isn’t much API; you just save files and they get synced. In case of conflict, best case, you get two files. Worst — you get only one :) This simplicity has an upside and a downside. The upside is: if you can work with that, it would work everywhere. That’s the interoperability part from Martin’s talk. The downside is: you can’t do much with it, and it probably won’t be optimal. But will it be enough? Version 1: Super-naive Let’s just save our state in a file and let Dropbox sync it (in my case, I’m using Syncthing, but it’s the same idea. From now on, I’ll use “Dropbox” as a common noun). Simple: But what happens if you change the state on two machines? Well, you get a conflict file: Normally, it would’ve been a problem. But it’s not if you are using CRDT! CRDT is a collection of data types that all share a very nice property: they can always be merged. It’s not always the perfect merge, and not everything can be made into a CRDT, but IF you can put your data into a CRDT, you can be sure: all merges will go without conflicts. With CRDT, we can solve conflicts by opening both files, merging states, and saving back to state.xml. Simple! Even in this form, Dropbox as a common sync layer works! There are some downsides, though: conflicting file names are different between providers, some providers might not handle conflicts at all, it needs state-based CRDT. Version 2: A file per client The only way to avoid conflicts is to always edit locally. So let’s give each client its own file! Now we just watch when files from other clients get changed and merge them with our own. And because each file is only edited on one machine, Dropbox will not report any conflicts. Any conflicts inside the data will be resolved by us via CRDT magic. Version 3: Operations-based What if your CRDT is operation-based? Meaning, it’s easier to send operations around, not the whole state? You can always write operations into a separate append-only file. Again, each client only writes to its own, so no conflicts on the Dropbox level: Now, the operations log can grow quite long, and we can’t count on Dropbox to reliably and efficiently sync only parts of the file that were updated. In that case, we split operations into chunks. Less work for Dropbox to sync and less for us to catch up: You can, of course, save the position in the file to only apply operations you haven’t seen. Basic stuff. Theoretically, you should be able to do operational transformations this way, too. Demo A very simple proof-of-concept demo is at github.com/tonsky/crdt-filesync. Here’s a video of it in action: Under the hood, it uses Automerge for merging text edits. So it’s a proper CRDT, not just two files merging text diffs. Conclusion If you set out to build a local-first application that users have complete control and ownership over, you need something to solve data sync. Dropbox and other file-sync services, while very basic, offer enough to implement it in a simple but working way. Sure, it won’t be as real-time as a custom solution, but it’s still better for casual syncs. Think Apple Photos: only your own photos, not real-time, but you know they will be everywhere by the end of the day. And that’s good enough! Imagine if Obsidian Sync was just “put your files in the folder” and it would give you conflict-free sync? For free? Forever? Just bring your own cloud? I’d say it sounds pretty good.

For example, we're building a local-first multiplayer \"IDE for tasks and notes\" [1] where simply syncing flat files won't work well for certain features we want to offer like real-time collaboration, permission controls and so on. In our case we'll simply allow users to \"eject\" at any time by saving their \"workspace.zip\" (which contains all state serialized into flat files) and downloading a \"server.exe/.bin\" and switch to self-hosting the backend if they want (or vice versa).

More things should do exactly this! reply api 5 hours agoparentprevIf there's an app-specific backend sync server it's not going to be \"forever.\" Why can't syncing data be commodified via a dumb cloud that just syncs blobs? If you want privacy locally encrypt everything. We already have that in the form of S3 and friends, but they aren't consumer-accessible. We also have some platform-specific ones like Apple iCloud but those are platform-specific. In the end the problem is that there's no financial motive to do this. reply vonnieda 2 hours agorootparentI am working on exactly this in a music player I am writing. Specifically, you can use any S3 compatible storage to sync your music and metadata between devices, and it's end-to-end encrypted. I plan to offer single click resale of storage directly in the app for users who don't want to deal with access keys, secret keys, ACLs, and the like. reply jmull 4 hours agorootparentprevThe previous post's point is that they make their app's sync service as available to users as the app itself. \"Forever\" is the wrong word for any of this, but the sync service will live as long as the app does. (BTW, your idea supposes the ongoing existence of storage services with a common, stable API an app can be written against. You can barely say that exists now, much less expect it to into the indefinite future. The previous poster only assumes general servers are available, including BYO if you want.) reply arnorhs 4 hours agorootparentprevIt would be pretty slick if the export also included a versioned text spec defining the schema for the data..

I know that's not everyone's favorite topic, but I've got bills to pay and payroll to make. Our product is about 80% local-first, with live collaboration and image hosting needing a server. I plan to change that eventually, but I worry that jailbreaking the app in this way will lead to financial troubles. Obsidian's model seems nice: base app is free, and then payment for the networked portions like sync+publish. However, there's little data available on how well this works and how big of a TAM you need to make it sustainable. Or if it's even possible without an enterprise revenue channel. For those interested in building robust local-first + collaborative apps, I've been using Yjs for a few years now and have overall really enjoyed it. Multi-master collaboration also poses some stimulating technical and design challenges if you're looking for new frontiers beyond the traditional client-server model. reply gritzko 6 hours agoparentHa. I just realized it is 10 years since me, Alexei and Oleg launched our CRDT demo on HN. Funnily enough, it featured this mouse-cursor trick as well. It was a demo of the lib. It was August 2014 if I remember correctly. The post was submitted by Dan Abramov. Nostalgie. That repo is long abandoned https://github.com/gritzko/swarm Did CRDTs and local-first advance much since 2014? There is a bunch of research, way more CRDT libs on GitHub, but (somewhat) successful businesses you can count on one hand. I guess, that is the actual challenge - figure out the business model. reply jitl 4 hours agorootparentIt seems there’s a lot more availability of collaborative text editing features in SaaS apps I think due to the availability of convergent rich text data structures. Those seem to have democratized that specific feature. But I don’t see “local-first” with user-owned data or true decentralized apps being successful as businesses yet. reply XCSme 4 hours agoparentprevI build a self-hosted application (so I guess that qualifies as local-first), how I monetize it: one-time payment to get the product, then yearly (optional) paid support/updates. I am not too worried about piracy, as that is a battle you'll never win (games have been fighting this game for a long time). Create a good product that solves a real issue, get in front of people, and provide a good service, so that they are happy to support you in the future (either for updates on this product or for building new products). reply braden-lk 2 hours agorootparentAt the $800 - $2500 price range, that sounds awesome, but I'm in a market where $50 is considered outrageous.

Their business model was give away and capture. Give away much of the possible revenue stream in order to lock in students, learning centers, governments, offices, and hobbyists. That method of success has been well documented and replicated world wide. The above method is how Google’s horrible products are currently winning. Google is a serial murderer of its own products and services yet governments, schools, and companies fall over themselves to use Google products. Capture is a valid, and proven, revenue strategy. reply samuelstros 8 hours agoparentprevYep. Local-first is further commoditizing software. Users will refrain from paying a subscription if their app version works and they don't need updates. The good old buy-a-license with 1 year of updates will likely make a big comeback. Local-first software, at least in lix universe [0], does not have fixed recurring maintenance costs like running servers. The elimination of fixed recurring maintenance costs will lead to a proliferation of \"hobby apps\" that are undercut by price/make it free altogether. [0] https://github.com/opral/monorepo/blob/main/lix/README.md reply braden-lk 7 hours agorootparentWhich is wonderful for users that want that and are savvy enough to understand the limitations! However, hobby apps will not be able to afford designers or support or long-lived servers. As long as the social contract is clear, it's a net win. The issue comes when end-users expect the same level of support and continued updates from hobbyists as they got from commercialized apps. Spoiler alert: They absolutely do, at least in B2C. (Or in this case, H2C?) reply samuelstros 7 hours agorootparent> The issue comes when end-users expect the same level of support and continued updates from hobbyists as they got from commercialized apps. Maybe. Doesn't change the fact that software will be more commoditized. If software switching costs get close to 0 [because data is owned and can be opened by any other app], pricing pressure will get intense. Investors love cloud SaaS because they can rent-seek and extract margins of >80%. It's unlikely that apps that do not own and lock-in customer data can rent-seek to such a degree. If they do that, users will switch to the next best solution. reply braden-lk 7 hours agorootparentThe product is not just the program. People don't just care about function, they care about how the app makes them feel, how it affects how they think others perceive them, etc. -- the companies that can afford to market and make their experiences sexy will run laps around purely functional apps that can't, no matter how well they solve the problem (unfortunately). Good marketers and designers do not have the same proclivities towards working for free as developers do. The hope is that the markets are large enough that niche apps can carve out a healthy revenue with a more personal, \"homegrown\" experience. This is where my product lives, and so far it's worked well enough. Also, switching cost is never zero or even close to it. The user still has to click a button. I know it sounds like I'm being facetious, but coming from a large-scale B2C industry, a single button click is an enormous obstacle. reply dghlsakjg 5 hours agorootparentprevBut the reality is that there’s plenty of hobby app businesses that do the one time sale revenue model. The internet is rife with stories of hobbyists who would love to give adobe $500 to just buy their software outright. Many Adobe competitors offer exactly this! reply poisonborz 7 hours agorootparentprevFor most use cases the solution should be evident further down the road. Overwhelming majority of why a server is needed is data sync between clients. Self-hosting should have it's moment where a simple user-maintainable server solution emerges. Then you could just offer a plugin to that platform - a bit like how Synology works already. reply RandomMarius 3 hours agorootparentI've mostly been cloud free this way. I do send (sometimes encrypted) backups/copies elsewhere, but those are exceptions. And it works well across many client devices (and remote via DNS/forwarding). reply bee_rider 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat exactly do you mean by “hobby apps?” I’m slightly confused because it is pretty common to describe open source projects and the like as hobbyist programming, with all the expectations of customer service (specifically, none) that that entails. If somebody is taking money for something, it isn’t really a hobby, it is a job. It might be a poorly paid one, but they still have an ethical obligation to their customers, to meet some standards of merchantability and provide some level of customer service. But if you mean, “apps that hobbyists use” then that makes more sense. There’s nothing wrong with producing a toolkit that a hobbyist can use to write their own apps of course. It is like producing hand tools—you have an ethical obligation to make sure the tools themselves are reasonably free of defects but of course you don’t have to provide customer support for the treehouse! reply samuelstros 6 hours agorootparentI refer to open source projects, indie hackers, and one man shows with \"hobby apps.\" Distribution (specifically maintenance) becoming cheaper will enable those people to compete/provide enough value to customers that larger companies face downward pricing challenges. reply fearthetelomere 5 hours agoparentprevRemember: it's local-first, not offline. When users subscribe they should be purchasing a license that renews periodically. Local-first apps should validate the license (based on its expiry) by connecting to the internet to ensure users are subscribed. If they're not subscribed or they don't have internet access, they cannot use pay-walled features. You should offer a free, fair, and robust export tool for those not subscribed, though unfortunately not many companies do this. What am I missing here? The drawback is of course when customers don't have internet access but are still valid subscribers, so they lose access to pay-walled features. One option would be to only offer annual licenses (infrequent license checking), another would be to offer a complementary 7 day license extension for the short-term until the user reconnects to the internet (grace period). Stop giving away your value proposition for free. Get paid fairly. reply braden-lk 2 hours agorootparentThe way we handle it is: subscribing = full access, non-subscribing = read-only access. Philosophically we'd probably not be viewed as \"true\" local-first software given this constraint, but like you said: we can't give away our value prop for free. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevPart of the ethos of local-first is permanent ownership of software over subscription services. Sure, it's not technically in the name, but it's very much part of the background for TFA. reply fearthetelomere 5 hours agorootparentI see, I didn't know that. Why would one sell permanent ownership of a networked product? I've been seeing the rise of \"lifetime\" subscription levels (pay once) for SaaS products, but I'm curious as to what the actual long-term economics of it are. If your cost of operations is not a one-time cost per user, I don't see how you can avoid a subscription model. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparent> Why would one sell permanent ownership of a networked product? You wouldn't. Maybe TFA has an extreme interpretation of local-first, but the entire point of the article is eliminating the last vendor-controlled server from certain kinds of apps so that the user can own the software forever. Obviously this doesn't work for all apps, and it sounds like OP may have one that needs some form of network component. In that case what you propose would work very well. reply britannio 5 hours agorootparentprevYou can charge the user once upfront, possibly after a free trial. 37 signals are trying it out with once.com. As a developer, you are in control of how local-first your application should be. reply WhyNotHugo 6 hours agoparentprevYou're not the first person that I hear having the exact same issue, and it's a very real one. IMHO, the problem isn't with local-first application themselves. The problem is that our economic system rewards players responsible for vendor-locking (and any sort of similar practices), while providing no support (or even livelihood) for folks focusing on delivering a great product free of artificial restrictions. reply jckahn 8 hours agoparentprevLocal-first isn’t a good model for projects that need to monetize. I’ve given this a lot of thought as well. I think it only makes practical sense for apps that exist to serve a public benefit. reply the_other 7 hours agorootparent> Local-first isn’t a good model for projects that need to monetize.

It brought Adobe, Ableton and many others to their dominant market positions, [...] What’s changed? To clarify the conversation, \"local-first\" vs \"cloud-based\" is inadvertently getting muddied up with revenue models such as single-payment vs ongoing subscriptions. Those are 2 separate concepts. Adobe/Ableton/Quicken desktop software still run locally on the users computer. Adobe Photoshop can save \".psd\" files locally on the computer. But they have ongoing subscription fees and if users don't keep up the payments, they lose functionality or stop working. Instead, what people often mean by local-first is \"local _data_ stored on my computer as a 1st-class concept\". The Single-Source-Of-Truth of data is preferably on my home computer and the cloud is just a convenient replica for backup or sharing. Ideally, the local-first data is also a an open format instead of a proprietary opaque blob. Examples would be local-first Obsidian (markdown files stored locally on computer) -- vs -- Notion (notes stored in the cloud). Or local-first NextCloud instead of cloud-based DropBox. As your examples showed, local-first software can be monetized via subscriptions. reply dghlsakjg 5 hours agorootparentOTOH, if I need a network connection to verify my subscription status for the software to work in the first place it eliminates one of the main benefits. reply skydhash 6 hours agorootparentprevDevelopers shooting themselves in the foot by providing applications for free or 4.99 usd for user growth.

This is the core of why local-first applications can’t be effectively monetized. Users expect the best things for free or very cheap, and that’s mostly incompatible with the local-first concept. reply robertlagrant 6 hours agorootparentprevFor Adobe: they would like your subscription money every month rather than occasional upgrades. reply endisneigh 6 hours agorootparentprevDid it work?

In any case, folks are free to try local apps for their business and post results. reply mike_hearn 4 hours agorootparentprevA bunch of things changed fundamentally in ways that will never go back. As a consequence shrink-wrap software licensing is dead and will never return, sorry :( That happened because: 1. Users expect apps to keep working in the face of platform regressions and policy changes, for \"free\" (no unexpected extra charges). In the 90s Microsoft went through heroics to make buggy apps work on Windows 95 because if someone bought Windows 95 and an app broke, the user returned Windows to the store and got a refund. In 2024 if Microsoft or Apple ship a buggy OS update and it breaks your app (which they do), the user returns your app to the store and gets a refund. They don't see the platforms changing around them, they just know that your thing worked yesterday, today it doesn't, it's your fault, fix it. This lack of 100% solid backwards compatibility means it's not feasible to sell a program once and let users keep it forever. They won't keep up their end of the bargain and, by the way, governments will always take their side and not yours so don't think you can just wash your hands of such problems via a EULA. Open source apps can get away with this because there was no purchase to begin with, commercial apps cannot. 2. App Stores happened. That means users can leave reviews and star ratings. In the 90s if you sold an app that happened to crash regularly if you pressed a certain combination of buttons, well, maybe three months later a magazine reviewer would notice or maybe they wouldn't. At any rate it hardly mattered unless you had some kind of unusually high level of bugginess and that fact spread through word of mouth. In 2024 if you ship a version with even very obscure bugs users affected by it will immediately start leaving negative reviews. You have to fix this or else your app will become unpopular and you'll lose money, but again, this means a continuous stream of updates which everyone gets, which requires ongoing revenue to pay for it. 3. Collaboration happened. In the 90s networks were weak and most computer users worked alone. If Fred bought Office 2000 and you were still using Word 95, then it was expected that Fred would just know this somehow and also know how to use the \"Save as\" dialog box to save in Word 95 format. It was also expected that Fred's employer would provide a synchronous LAN fileshare using SMB where Fred could store a file. This was OK because remote work wasn't really a thing, and people tended to work in the same physical building. Because apps did releases so rarely and file writes were all synchronous/SMB supported file locks, this complexity was just about tractable albeit only as long as users had a high tolerance for computer nonsense. In the modern era collaboration is expected to Just Work without users having to phone up their mates to find out what app version they're using. That means everyone has to be on the same version, which means everyone has to get all the updates all the time, which means they all benefit from ongoing work by the company, which means a subscription. Plus we expect to be able to work from anywhere in the world, and from devices that don't support synchronous networked filesystems like iPads which means a custom per-app server farm. Those costs also matter here, see my other comment for why the Dropbox trick doesn't really work that well. You ask why games don't seem to be affected by this. They are affected by this and they adopt a few strategies: • Primarily target games consoles. Way more stable platforms with way fewer regressions. • Adopt subscription payments too. See: MMORPGs. • Keep costs low and hope they can cover them from the sales revenue as the player base expands. • Just don't support games for more than a few months after they launch. That works because games are short-lived things usually. If the game is broken a year after release a few hard-core fans will care but most people have completed the game or moved on, and won't notice. reply jamesgeck0 38 minutes agorootparentA lot of game developers can afford to \"ship it and forget it\" because game consoles don't break APIs, and Windows has generally best-in-class backwards compatibility.

As an enterprise I'd love to pay for a local application wherever possible. Oracle and MS still make billions on what are effectively local database applications.

For the specific given example of syncing files it might make sense, but I'm starting to see CRDTs used in places they don't need to be. Where is your ground truth? How collaborative is a given resource? How are merge conflicts (or any overlapping interactions) handled? Depending on your answers, CRDTs might be the wrong tool. Please don't forget about straightforward replicated state machines. They can be very easy to reason about and scale, although require bespoke implementations. A centralized server can validate and enforce business logic, solve merge conflicts, etc. Figma uses a centralized server because their ground truth may not be local.[1] If you try a decentralized state machine approach the implementation is undoubtedly going to be more complex and difficult to maintain. However, depending on your data and interaction patterns, they still might be the better choice over CRDTs. It could be argued that even for this example, two local-first clients editing the same file should not be automatically merged with a CRDT. One could make the case that the slower client should rename their file (fork it), merge any conflicts, or overwrite the file altogether. A centralized server could enforce these rules and further propagate state changes after resolution.

There is exciting movement in the space but imo people focus too much on CRDTs, seemingly in the hopes of optimal solutions to narrow problems.

If you don’t have multiple users vanilla Dropbox with old-school file based apps are fine because you don’t need concurrency for one person. So I agree with you: why pay for CRDTs if you aren’t using it? This has been solved for 15 years at least. For local first to be a meaningful term, it has to provide something that can compete with modern apps while providing some meaningful change in terms of portability, data ownership, privacy, hackability, self sovereignty, etc. Otherwise we’re just over-engineering ourselves into spurious idealism. reply mweidner 6 hours agoparentprev> This doesn’t work for collaborative software.

E.g: you edit the intro paragraph, and your buddy adds a conclusion, both while offline (or simultaneously). Dropbox can't/doesn't resolve the conflict in your files, and instead picks a winner.

Sadly, I built it in prototype style and didn't take the time to fix/rebuild things properly. But I have used this app every week since, and one of the lessons is that operations-based files grow pretty quickly. If you want to keep sync times short and bandwidth usage to a minimum, you have to consider how you keep read and write times to a minimum. I use localStorage for the client-side copy, and reaching the 5 MB quota isn't that hard either. These things can be solved, but you have to consider them during the design phase. So yes, it's cool stuff, but the story isn't over with using automerge and op-based files. reply jitl 4 hours agoparentlocalStorage is pretty bad, we saw lost writes under contention from different tabs in all browsers and stopped using it for write-path user data in 2019. IndexedDB is annoying but more trustworthy. With op sync you can compact & GC old ops past some temporal or data size threshold. Say, if the file reaches $LIMIT mb, compact and drop old ops past $OLDEST_OP_DATE when the limit is hit. If you receive edits from before the cutoff, fork the file since you can’t merge them without conflict. reply poisonborz 7 hours agoprevI expect that one mild catastrophe, one that is bound to occur every now and then, one just large enough to disrupt networks for maybe a few weeks or months on a continental scale - would make everyone realize how foolish the whole cloud (first) idea was, and it would be left in the dust along with the perhaps decade of its work and proponents. reply sodality2 6 hours agoparent\"Disrupt networks\" how?

Not saying that's not iPhone's fault, but I doubt any of this works on that platform reply IggleSniggle 5 hours agoparentI've been a happy user of a PWA doing local sync. That said, the data it needs to sync can fit in localStorage. Not affiliated in anyway, but the app is http://projectionlab.com/ and it allows you to choose between json import/export, localStorage sync, and server-based sync as desired. Since it has an easy to use import/export, sync with some other cloud provider on iOS is basically just a matter of \"saving the file,\" since iOS lets you do background sync of authorized Files providers. Even though it's a web app, being able to download the page and then after run it entirely offline in a fresh browser window each time, built a lot of trust with me, to the point where I mostly run it with localStorage enabled and only occasionally check its online/offline behavior anymore. reply joemaller1 5 hours agoprevDropbox, OneDrive and others are dangerous because they default to cloud-first. To \"save disk space\", they upload your files and provide a proxy/placeholder for your actual content. If something happens to the provider, or they decide they don't like you or your files, your data is gone. Worse than gone, because you still have the empty proxies -- the husks of your files. I personally know of more than one instance where seemingly innocuous data triggered some automated system at Dropbox and the user was locked out of their files without recourse. If you're using cloud storage, make *absolutely certain* you have it set to download all files. If your cloud storage exceeds the drive space of a laptop (small businesses, etc), get a cheap dedicated PC and a big drive, then set up at least one dedicated cloud mirror. Local-first cloud storage is great, but the potential for catastrophic data-loss is not even remotely close to zero. reply braza 1 hour agoparentSome years ago I lost my device and I got in first place the experience on how I was dependent of those cloud services for almost everything since email until my photographs. Fast forward I made exactly that: I got another cloud provider and I started to sync to another 2 physical local devices one with by-sync (remote to device and device to remote) and another one only local to remote on top of a local NAS and hard drive. reply milansuk 8 hours agoprev> But file syncing is a “dumb” protocol. You can’t “hook” into sync events, or update notifications, or conflict resolution. There isn’t much API; you just save files and they get synced. In case of conflict, best case, you get two files. Worst — you get only one :) Sync services haven't evolved much. I guess, a service that would provide lower APIs and different data structures (CRDTs, etc.) would be a hacker's dream. Also, E2EE would be nice. And if they closed the shop, I would have all the files on my devices. reply armincerf 5 hours agoprev\"syncing doesn’t work without a server\" I don't think this is true, granted there are some big challenges to transfering data between devices without a central server, but there are several projects like https://dxos.org/ which use p2p, and also there's https://ditto.live/ which uses bluetooth/wifi direct for cases where all users will be in the same room or on the same local network (imagine wanting to play chess with a friend sitting in a different row on a plane without wifi - I was in this situation recently and was pretty surprised that I couldn't find anything on the app store that could do this!) Of course most of the time its better to have a server because p2p still has a lot of difficulties and often having a central 'source of truth' is worth the costs that come with a server based architecture.

What really drives the swing of the pendulum are the business incentives. Is the goal to sell mainframes? Then tell customers than thin clients powered by a mainframe allow for easy collaboration, centralized backups and administration, and lower total cost of ownership. Do you want recurring SaaS revenue? Then tell customers that they don't want the hassle of maintaining a complicated server architecture, that security updates mean servers need constant maintenance, and that integrating with many 3rd party SaaS apps makes cloud hosting the logical choice. We're currently working on an Local First (and E2EE) app that syncs with CRDTs. The server has been reduced to a single go executable that more or less broadcasts the mutation messages to the different clients when they come online. The tech is very cool and it's what we think makes the most sense for the user. But what we've also realized is that by architecting our software like this we have torpedoed our business model. Nobody is going to pay $25 per user per seat per month when it's obvious that the app runs locally and not that much is happening on the server side. Local First, Forever is good for the user. Open data formats are good for the user. Being able to self-host is good for the user. But I suspect it will be very difficult to make software like this profitably.

This Local First trend, if it is here to stay (and I hope it will be) might destroy a lot of SaaS business models. reply mike_hearn 4 hours agoprevI'm pretty sure I'm one of the only people in the world who has actually built an app that works in this exact way, and shipped it, and supported it. It was called Lighthouse and it was for organizing crowdfunds using Bitcoin smart contracts, so it didn't only have the fun of syncing state via DropBox+friends but also via a P2P network. Here's what I learned by doing that: 1. Firstly - and this is kinda obvious but often left unarticulated - this pattern more or less requires a desktop app. Most developers no longer have any experience of making these. In particular, distribution is harder than on the web. That experience is what eventually inspired me to make Conveyor, my current product, which makes deploying desktop apps waaaaay easier (see my bio for a link) and in particular lets you have web style updates (we call them \"aggressive updates\"), where the app updates synchronously on launch if possible. 2. Why do you need aggressive updates? Because otherwise you have to support the entire version matrix of every version you ever released interacting with every other version. That's very hard to test and keep working. If you can keep your users roughly up to date, it gets a lot simpler and tech debt grows less fast. There are no update engines except the one in Conveyor that offers synchronous updates, and Lighthouse predated Conveyor, so I had to roll my own update engine. Really a PITA. 3. Users didn't understand/like the file sharing pattern. Users don't like anything non-standard that they aren't used to, but they especially didn't like this particular pattern. Top feature request: please make a server. All that server was doing was acting as a little DropBox like thing specialized for this app, but users much preferred it even in the cryptocurrency/blockchain world where everyone pretends to want decentralized apps. 4. It splits your userbase (one reason they don't like it). If some users use DropBox and others use Google Drive and others use OneDrive, well, now everyone needs to have three different drive accounts and apps installed. 5. Users expect to be able to make state changes that are reflected immediately on other people's screens e.g. when working together on the phone. Drive apps aren't optimized for this and often buffer writes for many minutes. You don't really need this pattern anyway. If you want to make an app that works well then programmer time is your biggest cost, so you need a business model to fund that and at that point you may as well throw in a server too. Lighthouse was funded by a grant so didn't have that issue. Re: business models. You can't actually just sell people software once and let them use it forever anymore, that's a completely dead business model. It worked OK in a world where people bought software on a CD and upgraded their OS at most every five years. In that world you could sell one version with time-limited support for one year, because the support costs would tend to come right at the start when users were getting set up and learning the app. Plus, the expectation was that if you encountered a bug you just had to suck it up and work around it for a couple of years until you bought the app again. In a world where everything is constantly changing and regressing in weird ways, and where people will get upset if something breaks and you tell them to purchase the product again, you cannot charge once for a program and let people keep it forever. They won't just shrug and say, oh OK, I upgraded my OS and now my $500 app is broken, guess I need to spend another $300 to upgrade to the latest version. They will demand you maintain a stream of free backported bugfixes forever, which you cannot afford to do. So you have to give them always the latest versions of things, which means a subscription. Sorry, I know people don't want to hear that, but it's the nature of a world where people know software can be updated instantly and at will. Expectations changed, business models changed to meet them. reply mwcampbell 2 hours agoparent> In a world where everything is constantly changing and regressing in weird ways Rather than accept that this is just the way it is, we should try to make a more stable software world for our users.

The problem with it though, is that it almost always suck or isn't that important or both. At least for myself, I barely use any local first software. The software that I do use that is local in any important sense of the word is basically local-only software. I realize this every time I lose connection on my phone. It becomes pretty much a pretty bad camera compared to my Sony. I live in a country were I have good 3G speed pretty much everywhere so internet connectivity is never an issue, not even on moving things like trains or boats. The very few times I have been flying or whatever I simply don't do any work because it's usually uncomfortable anyway. This is the main reason I don't really care about local first and have been diving into Phoenix Liveview the last couple of weeks. The productivity boost I get and cool realtime apps it empowers me to build is more important to me than the dream of making local first web apps. A realtime demo of things updating with multiplayer functionality is a far easier sell than \"look, the app works even when I turn on flight mode\". And honestly, in like 99% of the time, it is also more useful. I have done local first web apps before and it is always such a pain because syncing is a near impossible problem to solve. What happens if you and someone else have done changes to the same things like 2 hours or more ago? Who even remembers which value is correct? How do you display the diffs? No matter what you do, you probably need to implement some kind of diffing functionality, you need to implement revisions because the other guy will complain that the changes were overwritten and so on. There is just so many issues that is very hard to solve and require so much work to be done that it isn't worth it unless you are a large team with a lot of resources. You end up with a complicated mess of code that is like git but worse in every way.

So not only a complete loss of control and computing autonomy, but also a financial drain as well when counting the cost of all the apps and services. Mean while, I'll happily chug along, local first, and if the internet doesn't work, at most my web browsing and email suffers, but since I do have my reference libraries, documentation and interpreters available locally, I can still get work done until the internet comes back up. reply braden-lk 7 hours agorootparentConvenience is king. As life piles up (errands, parenting, everything), cognitive capacity goes down and the more the user wants a \"push button do everything\" solution. They'll trade autonomy for ultra-convenience + a dropped internet connection now and then.

I have no idea if it used to be like that or if is a function of modern society where you get accustomed to it due to a lifestyle that is good for the majority of the time. Some people like me cares too much about too much and thinks a lot about stuff like this. I wish more people would care about more things but it just ain't so. reply staticelf 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah I kind of agree with what you're saying, the main issue for me is that I work in web dev and very few people are like you are and would pay for local first software. I have a hard time even convincing people I know hate cloud spyware shit to use local first alternatives that require just a little more setup. I would love to make all my work local first but when the users are requesting other things I have to oblige. The feature list is long and the time is short. I simply can't spend a lot of time on making a sucky git alternative for when conflicts happen. When doing work on my spare time projects I want to make as much as possible in the little time that I do have, so local first is pretty much on the bottom of the list. Personally, I tried to build a music library but it's very hard today since you can't get music legally in a good cheap way. Illegally by torrenting is also hard because no one torrents music anymore. I do keep a library of movies but I rarely visit it and stream new movies with torrent software. Basically everything else, like work, is mostly online based today so there is not really much to do locally anymore except photo editing and watching movies for me. Of course, I do still develop on my machine but as soon as I get stuck on something I need the internet to look up some reference or whatever and if I don't have the internet I can't get emails or chat messages from colleagues or push my code anyway so then I can only work for a short while. I completely hate most cloud software and prefer local first but my issue is that no one except nerds on hackernews really cares about it and it is too much work for little gain. I actually are in a process to rewrite a side project that I hope to one day be a business from a local-first react project to a phoenix liveview. Why? Because I think the realtime aspects of the project will bring in more customers and it's far easier to maintain the state. So again, less work and more features I will actually get paid for. If I ever make it to a stable business, I will probably make a small portion of the app work offline because I know some customers will like it when they use it under ground. reply endisneigh 6 hours agoprevI’ll go against the grain and say that local first isn’t really necessary for most apps and spending time on it is a distraction from presumably more fundamental product problems.

Disappointed not to see a dozen other fingers scrolling the page :) reply dgroshev 6 hours agoprev(this should probably be a post) CRDTs and local first are ideas that is perpetually in the hype cycle for the last decade or so, starting around the time Riak CRDTs became a thing and continuing all the way to today. Niki's post is a perfect illustration: CRDTs offer this \"magical\" experience that seems perfectly good until you try building a product with them. Then it becomes a nightmare of tradeoffs: - state-based or operation-based? do you trim state? how? - is it truly a CRDT (no conflicts possible), a structure with explicit conflict detection, or last-writer-wins/arbitrary choice in a trench coat that will always lose data? Case in point: Automerge uses pseudo-random conflict resolution, so Niki's solution will drop data if it's added without a direct causal link between the edits. To learn this, you have to go to \"under the hood\" section in Automerge docs and read about merge rules very attentively. It might be acceptable for a particular use case, but very few people would even read that far! - what is the worst case complexity? Case in point: yjs offers an interface that looks very much like JSON, but \"arrays\" are actually linked lists underneath, which makes it easy to accidentally become quadratic. - how do you surface conflicts and/or lost data to the user in the interface? What are the user expectations? - how do you add/remove replication nodes? What if they're offline at the time of removal? What if they come online after getting removed? - what's user experience like for nodes with spotty connection and relatively constrained resources, like mobile phones? Do they have to sync everything after coming online before being able to commit changes? - what's the authoritative node for side effects like email or push notifications? - how do you handle data migrations as software gets updated? What about two nodes having wildly different software versions? - how should search work on constrained devices, unless every device has the full copy of the entire state? Those tradeoffs infect the entire system, top to bottom, from basic data structures (a CRDT \"array\" can be many different things with different behaviour) to storage to auth to networking to UI. Because of that, they can't be abstracted away — or more precisely, they can be pretend-abstracted for marketing purposes, until the reality of the problem becomes apparent in production. From Muse [1] to Linear [2], everyone eventually hits the problems above and has to either abandon features (no need to have an authoritative email log if there are no email notifications), subset data and gradually move from local first to very elaborate caching, or introduce federation of some sort that gravitates towards centralisation anyway (very few people want to run their own persistent nodes). I think this complexity, essential for local-first in practice, is important to contextualise both Niki's post and the original talk (which mostly brushed over it).

Let's say a day BeanCount (my preferred personal finance software) disappear, well, so far I can switch to Ledger or HLegder, the switch demand a bit of rg/sed works but it's doable. If let's say Firefly disappear I still have my data, but migrating them to something else it's a nightmare. Of course such events are slow, if the upstream suddenly disappear the local software still work, but after some times it will break due to environmental changes around it. With classic FLOSS tools that's a limited problem, tools are simple without much dependencies and they are normally developed by a large spread community. Modern tools tend to be the opposite: with gazillion of deps often in https://xkcd.com/2347/ mode. My digital life is almost entirely in Emacs, the chances Emacs disappear are objectively low and even if it happen even if it have a very big codebase there are not much easy-to-break deps BUT if I decide to go the modern path, let's say instead of org-attaching most of my files I decide to put them on Paperless and use them instead of via org-mode notes links with Dokuwiki or something else I get much more chances something break and even if I own anything my workflow cease to exists quickly. Recover would be VERY hard. Yes, paperless in the end store files on a file system, I can browse them manually, Zim have essentially the same Dokuwiki markup so I can import the Wiki, but all links will be broken and there is no direct quick-text-tweaking I can apply to reconstruct http links to the filesystem. With org-attach I can, even if it use a cache-like tree not really human readable. Anyway to have personal guarantees of ownership of our digital life local-first and sync are not the only main points. The corollary is that we need the old desktop model \"an OS like a single program, indefinitively extensible\" to be safe, because it's much more fragile at small potatoes level, but it's much more resilient in the long run. reply koliber 8 hours agoprevFirst there were mainframes with thin dumb clients.

I agree with GP: the 80s and 90s were quite the decades. Back then it was normal to have, say, a 3D modelling / rendering software on your computer (like 3DS Max). And something to create music yourself. And a software allowing you to do DTP (with the 'D' even standing for Desktop). We already had IDEs and some of us had Emacs / vi(m). Computers were used both for work and leisure and they were certainly used in creative ways, to produce \"stuff\", to experiment. They were more than simply passive devices made to purely consume AI-generated crap. And we already had BBSes then the Internet. We had Usenet newsgroups. By the mid to late 90s we had Nestcape and \"alltheweb\", then Google. It was local first, but with access to the world's knowledge, basically. And we had games and networked games: I was playing Warcraft II over the Internet in the mid-nineties and Counter-Strike in beta in 1999. At that point it was kinda peak civilization, before the gamification of search engines / enshitification of everything. Lootboxes weren't a thing. Seeing ten zombies mindlessly consuming poor content at a bus stop wasn't a thing yet. And I don't think the move to web-first / browsers-first / ultra-slow mono-threaded JavaScript first (JS was really pathetic at the beginning) empowered users: it was a step back, going years and years back in capabilities compared to what we have locally on our computers. And, today, if you want to create something in 3D, you'll be using Blender. For music, you'll use something local too. For DTP: same thing. Heck, you'll be creating websites / webapps using a mostly local-first solution. I do think this last quarter of a century the Web has destroyed the experience, not enriched it. It has turned users into dumb consumers of content. Sure, I can order stuff on Amazon in two clicks (which I do) and it's more convenient than using eBay to order that video tape of \"Le Mans\" in the mid nineties (which I did too): but Amazon is just more consumerism. And it's not just dumb consumerism: it's accompanied with total surveillance and insecurity. To me in the 80s and 90s computers had, compared to their capabilities, way more richness of experience than most experience today. What did I not have back then? Hmmm. Access to my broker in real-time: that's one I use a lot. Oh, wait, I'm using my broker's desktop app. As a fun sidenote, HN would have worked fine on Netscape in the nineties.

    "originBody": "you're *sure* you don't want to use a Microsoft account?? — Microsoft removes documentation for switching to a local account in Windows 11 But most Microsoft account sign-in workarounds for Windows 11 continue to work. Andrew Cunningham - 6/24/2024, 7:43 PM Enlarge / A PC running Windows 11. Microsoft reader comments 248 One of Windows 11's more contentious changes is that, by default, both the Home and Pro editions of the operating system require users to sign in with a Microsoft account during setup. Signing in with an account does get you some benefits, at least if you're a regular user of other Microsoft products like OneDrive, GamePass, or Microsoft 365 (aka Office). But if you don't use those services, a lot of what a Microsoft account gets you in Windows 11 is repeated ads and reminders about signing up for those services. Using Windows with a traditional local account is still extremely possible, but it does require a small amount of know-how beyond just clicking the right buttons. Further Reading Windows-as-a-nuisance: How I clean up a “clean install” of Windows 11 and Edge On the know-how front, Microsoft has taken one more minor, but nevertheless irritating, step away from allowing users to sign in with local accounts. This official Microsoft support page walks users with local accounts through the process of signing in to a Microsoft account. As recently as June 12, that page also included instructions for converting a Microsoft account into a local account. But according to Tom's Hardware and the Internet Wayback Machine, those instructions disappeared on or around June 17 and haven't been seen since. Despite the documentation change, most of the workarounds for creating a local account still work in both Windows 11 23H2 (the publicly available version of Windows 11 for most PCs) and 24H2 (available now on Copilot+ PCs, later this fall for everyone else). The easiest way to do it on a PC you just took out of the box is to press Shift+F10 during the setup process to bring up a command prompt window, typing OOBE\\BYPASSNRO, rebooting, and then clicking the \"I don't have Internet\" button when asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network. Advertisement Other workarounds include using the Rufus tool to create a USB installer that will automatically bypass the Microsoft account sign-in requirement, or (for Windows 11 Pro users) indicating that you want to join the PC to a corporate domain and then not actually joining it to a domain. Setting the PC up with a Microsoft account and then signing out afterward is also still an option. There is one workaround that has allegedly stopped working—it used to be that trying to \"sign in\" with a nonexistent email account would get you a local sign-in option. But as of earlier this month, according to Windows Central editor Zac Bowden, it looks like the Windows 11 setup screen will just ask you to try another email address instead. To be fair to Microsoft, all the big tech companies want you to sign in with an account before you can use all the features of the software, but neither Apple nor Google goes as far as to mandate account sign-in to access basic functionality. Macs, iPhones, and iPads will all let you complete the setup process without signing in, though you do have to know which buttons to click. Google will allow you to use Chromebooks in guest mode, and Android phones and tablets are still usable without signing in (though this does make it more difficult to find and install apps). Microsoft's pushiness remains unique; there's definitely a difference between a company that would really prefer that you sign in and one that forces you to. reader comments 248 Andrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

It really wasn’t that intrusive and eventually the company folded and I got a free (shitty) ad-free pc out of it. I’m a Mac user now but when I pull up windows 11 on my kid’s or wife’s laptop, it feels like that free-pc dot com again, only it’s in every person’s PC. I’m genuinely shocked at the amount of trash that barrages a common user in windows, and shocked that Microsoft gets away with it. My 14 year old gets barraged with not just co-pilot but a bunch of news and trash clickbait that is straight inappropriate for kids to see. I’ve had to remove it all twice but with every significant update, somehow my settings get reversed and we’re back at square one. I tried even using local accounts but it causes significant issues in the OS. If you’d told me in 1999 that free-pc.com was the dystopian digital future we’d all be living in, I’d have laughed you out of the room - but that’s exactly what we have.

My mother installed Windows 11 on a lab computer and had to call me for tech support for the first time in 20 years because she couldn't figure out how to do the most basic things. This is a PhD physicist who has been programming Fortran and Python since the 1990s and taught her parents how to use Ubuntu as their daily driver, yet she was completely stumped by Windows 11. It's been a daily struggle for her since. Sadly all I could say was \"yeah, that's why I use Linux\" reply CydeWeys 4 hours agorootparentIt seems like it's just a part of aging, sadly. My dad was using computers at MIT back in the 60s before hardly anyone else had ever seen one. I had access to a computer at home my entire life even though the most basic monochrome green PC compatible was $10k in today's money [1], and I remember him using an acoustic coupler modem to connect to some network (a BBS?) at triple digit baud through the actual telephone handset, long before the World Wide Web even existed. And yet now ... he barely does anything with computers besides play freemium mobile games on his phone. Doesn't email too much anymore, doesn't have online logins to just about anything (like his bank accounts), and can't handle basic debugging of tech issues anymore. I think people just give up at some point and stop trying to stay current with this stuff.

Or, they realize that 90% of it adds zero value to their lives. When you get older, you really do start thinking about how fast the years went by and how they are going to be gone before you know it, and do you want to spend any significant fraction of that time sitting at a computer, yet again wasting hours on \"debugging tech issues\" that a 20-something developer in California or Oregon has yet again foisted upon the world. Also as you get older you have figured out that if you don't want to do something, you just pretend you don't know how, and eventually someone else will do it for you. reply ragnese 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm so sorry that your poor mother had to install Windows on a lab computer.

They know that means no one will lock into their software because it sucks. reply Sharlin 5 hours agoparentprevI’m not quite sure why there hasn’t been more regulationary or legislative pushback to MS’s antics this time. One would expect the EU at least to not have a very favorable view on this stuff. reply superultra 4 hours agorootparentI think it's a combination of two things - one is that we are in a monopoly friendly environment gilded age for business that was not there in the 90s, and two is that MS was an easy target in the 90s because they were really the only target. But if you're the US government, if you go after MS you have to go after like 6 other companies for effectively doing the same thing even if it's not OS level. It's just not possible. Digital business has won by deluge. I mean, throwing co-pilot into everything is literally the 2024 version of inlcuding IE on everything in the 90s and MS does it with impunity because they can. reply Delk 5 hours agoparentprev> I tried even using local accounts but it causes significant issues in the OS. Which kinds of issues? Honest question. I don't use Windows 11 a lot on my personal laptop but I set it up with a local account and haven't noticed any major issues in my limited use.

I have managed to say at Windows 10 with strictly local accounts only. reply ca_tech 5 hours agoparentprevYour point is interesting because I see this across the home hardware industry. Cheap electronics were subsidized by data collection and I suppose that market was lucrative until it wasn't. It happened behind the scenes, we knew it was going on, but it was abstracted away enough that we did not think about it. Now what is happening is that the hardware providers are getting into the marketing game directly. Personally in the past year I've given up on two pieces of hardware Alexa and Roku because they have morphed into ad machines. The market is open for privacy, convenience, and quality. Unfortunately, Apple seems to be the only major player in that space right now and we are paying their premium. reply gigel82 2 hours agorootparentApple is already one of the largest ad companies in the world and they are clearly working very hard to get bigger($10.34 billion ad revenue in 2023). Sure, they're great at PR and marketing themselves as \"private\" but they're just as bad as the rest of them. Also fan boys, I'd be willing to bet if Apple launches a \"private personalized ad platform\", the fanboys will be singing its praise instead of being appalled. reply giantg2 5 hours agoparentprevThe clean install seems fine to me, as long as you turn off all the data collection toggles during setup. It seems like the bigger issue are the manufacturers shipping with all sorts of junk on it. It surprises me that Norton and McAfee are still shipping pre-installed. reply consf 5 hours agorootparentMany intrusive features are enabled by default, and casual users may not be aware of how to disable them, leading to widespread acceptance by default. reply giantg2 4 hours agorootparentSuch as?

And their standards are getting disappointing reply criley2 5 hours agoparentprevThe way we use algorithms to pump offensive fake news content to everyone is shocking. It's no secret that Meta (facebook/instagram) pushes sexual content to minors and I think Meta may be the organization pushing the most sexual content to children in human history. And yet, we just ignore it? The news sources that get pumped into Windows are similarly as bad. Celebrity sexual content, openly fake political propaganda, scare mongering nonsense, just truly depraved garbage. I don't understand how these organizations reputations survive this. They're not just polluting our own systems with their depraved content, they're intentionally* targeting children with wildly inappropriate sexual content. This might seem radical but I think there should be severe criminal penalties for corporate executives who allow this kind of thing to happen. Until billionaires are truly brought to justice for the media hellscape they design to pad their billions, we will be completely at their mercy. I harbor few good feelings towards China and their system but they know how to disappear a billionaire who is \"too big to be good\" and magically the same services' algorithms don't push sexual content to children there. Tiktok* has a completely different algorithm and pushes completely different content. Maybe they figured it out. reply jacobwilliamroy 5 hours agoparentprevI just don't have a personal computer.

I'm a professional Microsoft stack developer (.NET, SQL Server, Power Platform, M365). I first tried Linux in the late 90s, never stuck with me. But 2 weeks ago I installed Linux on my home setup to run 24/7. There's some seriously dumb issues with it: Ubuntu snaps are terrible with no local fonts in FF and other snap-based software has surprising bugs and crashes you don't realise are the fault of snaps until you waste hours researching it, everybody pushes AppImages but you can't get launcher shortcuts without doing it all manually in a friggin .desktop file* (you could do this 30 years ago in Win3.1 without having to search around for an icon!!!), you can't consistently pin stuff to a taskbar, etc. But I think I'll be sticking with it all the same. Microsoft could ban my Microsoft account and then what, I can't use my PC anymore?! * Yes I know there's some software you can download to do it but seriously it's not been updated for ages and this should be core OS GUI functionality. I switched to Debian and KDE which at least has more flexibility. reply jjice 5 hours agorootparent> There's some seriously dumb issues with it: Ubuntu snaps are terrible... It's so upsetting that Ubuntu went so hard in on Snaps. I just end up with issues caused by their sandboxing with hardware and config access and you end up having to fight to find a normal .deb install for FF instead of that damn default Snap. I hope the journey isn't too rough for you though - best of luck! reply burning_hamster 5 hours agorootparentI am also not a fan of the pivot to Snap. However, it is worth mentioning, that it has only been two years (I think, at least 22.04 LTS was the first release I had to wrestle with them on my machine), and the experience has become a lot better during this time. reply bee_rider 3 hours agorootparentIt took them 7 years to figure out that nobody needed Unity. Hopefully Snap will get sorted faster. reply G3rn0ti 5 hours agorootparentprevI understand your frustration with snaps, but I consider it a very good distribution channel for commercial applications on Linux systems. Something that Appimage or Flatpak could not easily provide without a commercial entity backing it like Canonical. reply vetinari 4 hours agorootparentSnap is a dead-end; but as usual, it takes some time until Canonical realizes that. If you want to easily distribute commercial applications, use flatpak. You could even have your own flatpak repo for your own products, if you wanted (it is really just static http). reply tracker1 4 hours agorootparentSnap apparently has a few advantages, like supporting non-gui apps (for servers) which isn't a good fit for AppImage or Flatpak. That said, I generally stick to Docker for server apps. I agree that the flatpak/appimage/snap options for apps, and in particular commercial apps is a decent idea. I think integration and permissions should probably move to something similar to the UX for phone apps though... it feels weird having to try to configure permissions that should be in the box. reply necrotic_comp 5 hours agorootparentprevAgreed with the sibling posts. Ubuntu isn't a great experience - it feels seamless until it breaks, and then it's just a world of pain. Debian/Mint/etc. are all good distros, but if you're willing to step up the learning curve just a bit, I'd definitely suggest Gentoo. I've been using it as my daily driver for several years now and it's made me feel like I'm actually in control of my machine (compiling all your code with debug flags so you can attach gdb when it's behaving weird so you can write a patch?! And then submit it to get sucked into upstream!? Yes please!). There's definitely a little work up front, but it's without a doubt the best experience I've had with Linux and I'd recommend it if you're up for it. reply pmlnr 6 hours agorootparentprev> Ubuntu There's your problem ;) Mint has been much more user friendly for a long time.

Looking forward to Cosmos going into release. reply logicprog 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's unfortunate, and I mean this genuinely here, in a sympathetic way, that you felt afoul of the common error that people who checked in with Linux 6 or more years ago make: assuming that Ubuntu is still the best and easiest to use distribution. Unfortunately, it really isn't anymore — the way they are pushing snaps (including forcing you to install snaps instead of regular packages even if you use the regular package manager) is really unfortunate because of how fucked snaps are to use, not to mention the fact that snaps are hardcoded to only be able to install from the proprietary closed source snap repository Canonical runs, and that store is full of crypto scams. Plus, in general, desktop PC Ubuntu has been getting buggier and more unreliable over time as Canonical switches their focus to the server. Honestly, if there was one misconception about Linux that I could erase with a snap of my fingers from all potential users minds, it would be that they should start with Ubuntu. IMO Debian is a pretty good choice if you have hardware that's about 2 to 4 years old or more and don't really care about getting the latest driver updates or advances in the Linux ecosystem, so you should have a better experience there, but if it starts to frustrate you that it takes years for huge fixes and advancements to make their way to you, I really enjoy Fedora. :-) Also, you mentioned two of the major alternative application packaging formats, snap and appimage, but have you heard of our Lord and savior Flatpak? :p It has all of the benefits of snaps (namely sandboxing, consistent environments and packaging dependencies along with applications, updates directly from upstream, distribution agnostic packaging, and automatic integration with your desktop environment) but none of the downsides (namely far better desktop environment integration thanks to portals and much much faster startup times and no perf impact during runtime unlike snaps). A lot of people talk down about them but I think that's mostly FUD. reply mergy 4 hours agorootparentThere used to need to be more of a delay on hardware and drivers with Debian but not so much anymore.

Been great. reply sevensor 4 hours agorootparentprevStrongly agree about Debian. I'm a longtime Arch user, but it causes headaches when you let a machine get too far out of date, and I wanted something I could put on the stack of old laptops in my closet. One by one, I'm migrating those to Debian Stable. It doesn't matter that everything is a major version behind; these laptops are now single-purpose machines that I rarely boot. They will always be behind regardless, and they might as well be behind on Debian Stable. It works flawlessly, and it's quite simple to set up at this point. (Also, having ancient single-purpose laptops is fantastic. I have one for recreational programming, and that's all I use it for. I have another for curating my music collection, and one for games. They don't need to be fast, or up to date, or power efficient, because I don't use them all the time. But when I do use them, it's nice to have them set up just so for the thing I want to use them for.) reply tracker1 4 hours agorootparentYou can also use Docker or Podman for containerized apps under Debian Stable that run libraries and versions ahead of your OS.

Pop with the pre-packaged Nvidia drivers. Other than Warzone and Tarkov (for which I keep a separate drive with Win10), the only things I haven’t quite managed to get sorted yet are (i) a convenient system-wide replacement for the frame limiter in RTSS, and (ii) relatedly, proper frame-pacing when streaming using Sunshine. Also, Steam seems to have a weird and widespread bug where if you use Big Screen, exit to the desktop mode, then launch BS again, you get like 5fps in the BS front-end itself (after launching a game, it’s fine). The workaround is to just kill the client when you exit Big Screen (usually when your gaming is done anyway). Really happy I made the switch and fully expect those niggles to get sorted (or my aptitude to improve) in due course. Windows has been shit for a while but recently it’s really crossed over into unbelievably shit. reply KronisLV 7 hours agorootparent> a convenient system-wide replacement for the frame limiter in RTSS My budget gaming PC is still on Windows and RTSS is a lifesaver: I couldn't stream or record some games with my Intel Arc A580 otherwise, since titles that use DX11 or older rendering technologies typically have worse performance than the more recent ones, ergo I have to stream/record at 30 and cap the framerate anywhere between 30-60 depending on the title, otherwise things get unstable. Of course, it's not ideal, but is at least workable. A bit odd that the card struggles with games like Ghost Recon Wildlands (DX11, 2017), but not Ghost Recon Breakpoint (Vulkan, 2019) or ones that use DX12 etc. Either that, or when there's a title that's badly coded and doesn't lock framerate properly to the screen refresh rate. Aside from that, around 90% of the 500ish Steam games I have would actually run on Linux (various indie titles, mostly), at least according to ProtonDB: https://www.protondb.com which is pretty nice to see, except for the fact that last I checked something like GOG doesn't run on Linux natively, though thankfully something like Lutris exists. reply Gormo 7 hours agorootparent> that last I checked something like GOG doesn't run on Linux natively GOG absolutely does offer native Linux games. reply KronisLV 7 hours agorootparentTheir own launcher doesn’t seem to have a Linux version, only Windows and Mac: https://www.gog.com/galaxy That’s why people seem to recommend Lutris or some other alternatives to access the actual library. reply lupusreal 2 hours agorootparentThey have a launcher??

Occasionally you will have a game that’s rated “platinum” still have bugs like a non-working controller. And both Nvidia and AMD have native control software (GeForce Experience and Adrenalin) that bundles a bunch of nice stuff like underclocking, recording, noise suppression, per-game profiles, frame limiter, etc; On Linux you have GreenWithEnvy and CoreCTRL, but neither are as nice or have even half the features. reply darkteflon 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah it’s so good isn’t it. Just painless and seamless. Some people seem to use the limiter in NVCP as an alternative, but that option isn’t exposed in the Pop Nvidia control panel, which is pretty basic. I’ve had a really mixed experience with GoG on Lutris and Heroic - both on Pop and the Steam Deck. I often struggle to get things running. It requires just that little bit more knowledge of what’s happening under the hood than Steam/Proton does, and I often just give up. My library is mostly in Steam anyway.

It’s not quite as seamless as RTSS, though. MH is a bit fussy about which graphics API you’re using, and can’t be applied system-wide (afaik) without going through that 3rd party (open-source) UI. Plus, even when it’s applied and working, it doesn’t seem to solve my Sunshine frame-pacing issues, which for me is the main use case (the physically attached monitor is VRR so I don’t need limiting locally). Great project though! I think I’m also a bit spoiled by the Steam Deck, where it’s so easy to set and change custom limits. I kind of just want that, for Pop, ha. reply juandemarco 7 hours agorootparentI've applied it system wide by setting `MANGOHUD=1` inside `/etc/environment`, which might be a little bit excessive but it works for me. You can also set hotkeys to toggle the Hud and the frame rate limits within ~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf, but I think there is a GUI tool that does it for you. As for the frame pacing, try with the beta NVidia drivers (v555) and Wayland, though I don't use Sunshine so I'm not sure if it'll help. reply darkteflon 7 hours agorootparentThanks for the tips! I’ve had one eye on Wayland, but with all the reports of trouble with Nvidia, and the upcoming (imminent?) transition to Cosmic for Pop, I figured I’d hold off - especially since I’m streaming less than I used to and playing more 90hz indies on the Steam Deck OLED. reply juandemarco 6 hours agorootparentThe latest driver makes Wayland usable on NVidia, as long as you use an up to date shell and the latest xwayland version, I've been using it since it came out and it's been great, games are much more smooth and the constant microstutter I'd been having with X is gone. Check out if these updates are all available on Pop, if they are give them a try! reply darkteflon 6 hours agorootparentThat’s excellent - thanks! I will check that out this weekend for sure. I might even spend some time getting to the bottom of when and how Cosmic is going to be rolled out, and whether it matters if you’re coming from X or Wayland. If it looks like it’s going to be pretty seamless, I’ll give Wayland a try in the interim too! reply Zambyte 6 hours agorootparentprevHuh, I didn't even realize MangoHUD can do frame limiting.

Fedora updates every 6 months, which is recent enough for me, vs years old major versions of things on Debian / Ubuntu. reply pmlnr 6 hours agorootparentprevManjaro is nice for nearly bleeding edge, imo. reply logicprog 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you want a combination of a base operating system that is rock solid stable and reliable, and a development environment that is bleeding edge, I really highly recommend checking out Fedora Atomic combined with Distrobox[2]. I think it's honestly basically the ideal setup: 1. with Fedora Atomic you get an operating system with the reliability and resistance to entropy and ability to power wash of Chrome OS, but also the ability to be changed via building your own custom image (its easy, check out BlueBuild) or with easily reversable overlays, plus an update cadence that offers an excellent middle ground between rolling release and point release — you get all non major version updates to your image's software basically immediately, but major versions wait for every 6 months so they can be integration tested and stuff. 2. And then with Distrobox you get the ability to trivially create a containerized environment with your Linux distribution of choice inside (can be different from the host), that nevertheless integrates almost seamlessly with the host (including having access to all of your hardware devices and your home directory and being able to trivially export applications, as well as easily open a shell inside the container with a simple terminal command), so you can have your cake and eat it too: a fully bleeding edge rolling release distro like Fedora Rawhide or Arch Linux inside your distro box to get the most up to date developer tools, but a more stable system as your host. And if something goes wrong in the container you can easily just blow it away and regenerate it since Distrobox has a declarative container spec (distrobox assemble). For GUI management of Distroboxes check out Pytaxis and BoxBuddy-rs. There are some things you should know if you go this route though that will save you a lot of pain and frustration: 1. Fedora Atomic is really barebones by default, and since layering is kind of painful it can be really annoying to do the system administration necessary to get it set up; especially if you have an Nvidia card and you have to do all the typical annoying shit you have to do on Linux to set that up. So instead of using vanilla Fedora Atomic, I highly recommend checking out Universal Blue[0], which offers pre-built Fedora Atomic images with all of that annoying setup and system administration done for you already. Their headline images (Bazzite and Bluefin) are really opinionated, but don't worry about that, their base images[1] are perfectly usable too! That's what I use :) 2. Layering packages via rpm-ostree should not be used for just random system utilities or applications. That's not how it is intended to be used, and that way lies only pain. The whole point is that the applications you use as a user, including terminal ones, should be separate from the core system, and not dependent on it, so they can be updated separately and not break each other. Layers, since they are updated by the system package manager, must be versioned in lockstep with the rest of the system, and the system image will fail to build if it can't update the layers you have, so really only use it for things you consider part of your essential OS. People who forget this tend to come away really hating Atomic distros. For your development environment or any build environments you need, create distroboxes and install applications inside them; for GUI applications, just use Flatpak, or install the application inside a distrobox and use distrobox-export to integrate the app into the host. If distrobox feels too heavyweight, or you just want various sundry utilities installed on your host system, then I recommend using something like Homebrew or Nix or Guix or Pkgsrc, that is, any package manager that installs things to your home directory in a way that is cleanly separated from your host system and independently updated. Universal Blue images come with a script to get Homebrew all set up for you. Wouldn't have been my first choice, but its very convenient. For more on the benefits of this, see this pastebin article I made: https://rentry.co/mm2qcwzh If you're wondering what the advantage of this is over Nix, the most important to advantages for me are that: 1. Nix's directory structure is basically completely unreadable and unusable for human beings in a way that is far worse than the default posix directory structure 2. Nix requires absolutely every program and package that runs on it to be custom patched to deal with its alternate directory structure, and while sure yes it's package repository is gigantic so a lot of that work is done for you, it can still cause weird problems and make things much more unreliable and good luck if there's a package that isn't there or hasn't been updated for a while. I'm on an emacs Discord and apparently installing it on Nix is very difficult. It's just another layer of possible incompatibility and failure and annoyance on top of the stack of those layers that compose linux. Meanwhile, you got most of the same benefits on an atomic distro, except: 1. it's all completely human readable 2. uses standardized technology so it's already compatible with everything without having to do any work 3. you can get fully different distros inside distro boxes, unlike with and Nix's equivalent. The other thing is that with nix, you configure your entire system at a layer of abstraction above what's actually happening on the system — it's not like that declarative config is actually directly deciding how the system operates, no, it's just layered on top of all of the existing crap Linux has going on, and you're just hoping that it can automatically, imperatively perform the actions necessary to keep your system in line with the config. That, and to get the same level of resistance to entropy and reversibility and ability to power wash and rebase and cherry-pick changes and stuff that you get with an atomic distro on nix, you would have to Version Control your Nix config and then also be very very careful with manually committing with informative commit names at regular intervals every time you make a change and stuff, instead of it being handled automatically for you and not requiring an extra version control tool slapped on top. Plus, Nix doesn't benefit from the minor, but still meaningful in my opinion, security benefits of an immutable image-based distro.

These two are the reasons this guy chose NixOS[1]: Why does NixOS work for me? I got attracted to Nix because of the possibility of being on the bleeding edge. According to repology Nix related package repositories are far up and to the right, their own cluster. In fact, only Arch is getting close by, but not being as good in terms of freshness, as can be seen from the position of AUR below [2]. 1: https://mihai.page/nixos-and-me/ 2: https://repology.org/graph/map_repo_size_fresh.svg - even nixpkgs 24.05 stable is so far ahead of every other repo it's not funny. reply noisy_boy 5 hours agorootparentMy main questions with NixOS are the following: 1. How friendly is the installer? I can get a second hand machine in which I can afford to nuke the disk and let Nix take it all but what if I need to install it side-by-side with my existing Windows install on my main laptop where I have a custom partitioning scheme? Ubuntu's installer provides sufficient flexibility to able to re-use partitions without overwriting them, allocate whatever mount point I want, resize things etc. I have been using Linux for close to 20 years but fdisk still spooks me. 2. How easy is multi-monitor setup and switching between setups? I have a main monitor that I usually use but occasionally I also use the laptop screen as a second display and sometimes I just use the laptop screen. 3. The 1st link alludes to be able to rollback changes from grub? How? What are my recovery options if I mess up the system? reply Zetaphor 4 hours agorootparent1. It uses Calamares, which is the GUI used by many distros. It was no different from installing any other distro with a GUI, including partitioning. 2. I'm using a laptop with AMD/NVIDIA on Wayland with KDE, this is no problem. This question is in the domain of your display server and compositor, not the base distro. I choose the previous build from grub, and then rollback my config files from git and rebuild. Every build creates an entry on the boot menu so I can go back to any previous iteration of my setup (I do have it set to only keep the last 15 builds) reply rofrol 4 hours agorootparentprevI needed to create bigger efi partition for nix, because nix stores there kernels. reply Aerbil313 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is funny. I am at the very moment side-by-side installing NixOS with Windows. And I am using two monitors. 1. The installer is Calamares. It's fantastic and fully user-friendly, no need to worry about it. 2. I'll speak for KDE6 which I personally find superior to GNOME. You can have either with NixOS. I don't think there's anything specific to NixOS on multi-monitor functionality. There's a menu accessed either through a keyboard shortcut or system tray that allows any of the 5 permutations laptop/monitor. And it pops up as an OSD menu whenever you connect a monitor. I'd say the functionality is 'done'. 3. I suggest you read up on how Nix works, once you understand it you can understand NixOS better. To summarize, all programs in your system are stored in /nix/store and accessed through symlinks. You don't access /bin/bash, you access the bash executable stored in /nix/store through its symlink in your PATH. And all the symlinks are stored in a single directory. This directory is called a profile. There are multiple profiles. With NixOS, not only just executables but the system configuration data (users, passwords, mounted disks, desktop environment settings, traditionally in /etc) is also stored in profiles. This way you can have multiple 'whole system configuration's all containing different system configurations, arbitrary versions of arbitrary programs, and they don't conflict. During the boot, you can choose between different profiles. It's not limited to grub, systemd-boot also works. reply rak 7 hours agoparentprevIt is getting to the point where I am really considering giving up games that require anti-cheats that only support windows.

In contrast, I love Android, even more than any desktop Linux, macos, ios, etc. It just works and the notifications are super customizable and Pixel blocks 90% of my spam and texts and the adblock is system wide (via VPN) and it auto updates overnight and just never gets in my way.

Google may be the spiest of them all, but at least they can deliver a great user experience and operating system.

I would not go so far as GP as to say that this dark pattern is better or worse than what Microsoft is doing, but I think it is a fair point that a Google/Microsoft account is needed on the biggest mobile/desktop platforms respectively and their attitude to privacy and user agency is somewhere between laissez-faire and contemptuous. With Android there does at least feel like with F-Droid, different OEMs, alternative apps, the web and even Other android spins that these aren't quite the lockdown that Windows is, although it's fair to say that in either case you shouldn't really be constantly on your guard for the next way that your operating system is going to try to trick you into giving away more of your stuff to them. reply rubenbe 6 hours agorootparentI agree, the dialogs are getting increasingly frequent and harder to \"click\" away.

One big reason I want a local account is so that my user profile in `C:\\Users` is my full first name with a Capital first character, i.e. `C:\\Users\\Username`. Signing in with an online account in the out-of-box experience means the user profile is truncated to 5 characters and begins with a lowercase character, i.e. `C:\\Users\\usern`[1]. This has been the behaviour since Windows 8. Additionally, Microsoft's decision to plague Windows with advertisements and Copilot was terrible. Windows is otherwise a damn good OS, and I wish the engineers had a say over the marketing and Copilot departments at MS.

And for that traditional gaming market, Apple has thrown up roadblocks rather than assistance - their frequent tech migrations backs the back catalogue sales that help companies a lot, stuff like deprecating OpenGL for Metal means they need to write bespoke code for apple platforms when even the consoles are pretty onboard with standardisation these days. reply adamtaylor_13 4 hours agorootparentJust this year at WWDC they announced a new tool that can port Unreal engine directly to Metal. It will only get better and better for gaming on MacOS. reply cjk2 5 hours agorootparentprevI disagree. I have a bet they will kill the console market dead by 2029. Most of the games run on off the shelf tech now which has Metal back ends. The hardware is rapidly evolving in capability since 2020. The Pro devices now are quite powerful. Enough grunt to do a half decent job of being a console. When that is commoditised in the mid-range, the existing market looks rather attractive to game developers. There's also an existing marketplace (app store) and the end users, from those who I know are fucked off with Sony and Microsoft. Yeah you're not going to run top end games at 4k on them but most people don't do that either. And the market for optimising them towards the large market scope makes sense.

IMO, it’s a terrible OS for a dedicated gaming box or htpc. I constantly have to switch from controller to a keyboard and touchpad because of new settings, random pop-up notifications, etc. after updates I’ll find disabled things that were re-enabled or new “features” that require me to disable because everything is auto opt-in… I had auto login enabled for a long time before it randomly stopped working and somehow the host had switched from local to Microsoft account login. Attempts to switch back resulted in a weird semi-broken state. I just left it as Microsoft login and found a way to re-enable auto-login with the Microsoft account. Windows 10 was pretty easy to convert to a htpc or arcade box.

It's a real piece of trash compared to my mental \"golden years\" being in Windows 7. Despite the meme, I've had a consistently good (and getting better) experience with the Linux desktop since I switched full time about four and a half years ago (with a lot of part time use before hand).

    "originBody": "HomeAbout FolkloreQuotesThe Original Macintosh: 19 of 123 Round Rects Are Everywhere! Author: Andy Hertzfeld Date: May 1981 Characters: Steve Jobs, Bill Atkinson Topics: Software Design, Inspiration, QuickDraw Summary: Steve inspires Bill by pointing out something about the real world Bill Atkinson worked mostly at home, but whenever he made significant progress he rushed in to Apple to show it off to anyone who would appreciate it. This time, he visited the Macintosh offices at Texaco Towers to show off his brand new oval routines, which were implemented using a really clever algorithm. Bill had added new code to QuickDraw (which was still called LisaGraf at this point) to draw circles and ovals very quickly. That was a bit hard to do on the Macintosh, since the math for circles usually involved taking square roots, and the 68000 processor in the Lisa and Macintosh didn't support floating point operations. But Bill had come up with a clever way to do the circle calculation that only used addition and subtraction, not even multiplication or division, which the 68000 could do, but was kind of slow at. Bill's technique used the fact the sum of a sequence of odd numbers is always the next perfect square (For example, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, etc). So he could figure out when to bump the dependent coordinate value by iterating in a loop until a threshold was exceeded. This allowed QuickDraw to draw ovals very quickly. Bill fired up his demo and it quickly filled the Lisa screen with randomly-sized ovals, faster than you thought was possible. But something was bothering Steve Jobs. \"Well, circles and ovals are good, but how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners? Can we do that now, too?\" \"No, there's no way to do that. In fact it would be really hard to do, and I don't think we really need it\". I think Bill was a little miffed that Steve wasn't raving over the fast ovals and still wanted more. Steve suddenly got more intense. \"Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!\". And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables. Then he pointed out the window. \"And look outside, there's even more, practically everywhere you look!\". He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find. When Steve and Bill passed a no-parking sign with rounded corners, it did the trick. \"OK, I give up\", Bill pleaded. \"I'll see if it's as hard as I thought.\" He went back home to work on it. Bill returned to Texaco Towers the following afternoon, with a big smile on his face. His demo was now drawing rectangles with beautifully rounded corners blisteringly fast, almost at the speed of plain rectangles. When he added the code to LisaGraf, he named the new primitive \"RoundRects\". Over the next few months, roundrects worked their way into various parts of the user interface, and soon became indispensable.

I still prefer the sharp corners. reply xnorswap 11 hours agoparentI still think windows 2000 looks the best out of that bunch, if not for the lack of font antialiasing. Windows 10 does a pretty good job too if not for the mess that is finding yourself in a universe of completely different UI paradigms that suddenly lurch from one to another, especially when navigating settings. reply Zelphyr 4 hours agorootparentI agree that Windows 2000 looks the best. I inherited a system that was running Windows Server 2003 that we have since replaced with up-to-date software. We needed to do it, of course but, the Windows 2000 UI was way better than what we have today. It was simpler but also more consistent. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparentprevWindows 2003 Server was the pinnacle - it looked and felt like Windows 2000, but had XP-era improvements, including ClearType (subpixel font antialiasing). reply int_19h 1 hour agorootparentYou could easily switch WinXP to use the classic theme, which made it look the same as Win2003. reply Sohcahtoa82 1 hour agorootparentWin7 with the Classic Theme was the peak of UI/UX, IMO. reply bhauer 1 hour agorootparentprevEven the default out of the box color scheme of WS 2003 was fantastic.

Okay, Microsoft wants to implement sim crappy new UI. At least give me the option to make it right reply seanmcdirmid 12 hours agoparentprevSharp corners are dangerous, I always feel like those windows will draw blood if I touch them with my mouse wrong. Strangely enough, I stayed in an East Asian hotel (I think with Tibetan influences?) and I remember the corners of the room all being rounded. It just felt better, more soothing? It would be hella expensive to get a craftsman to round all the corners in your room here in the west, you could do it with plaster but it wouldn’t last more than a decade and wouldn’t add any resale value. reply cesaref 2 hours agorootparentHere in the UK it was pretty common up to say the 1940s for plasterers to curve the corners on outward pointing walls in hallways. This usually extends from the skirting up to the picture rail. There is a lovely transition from the curve to a point just below the picture rail, which is very elegant, but a total pain if you are hanging wallpaper, well, that's my experience anyway! I've always felt it was one of those details that a plasterer could show off their skill, and you are right, it softens the corner in a very pleasing way. reply bhauer 55 minutes agorootparentprev> I remember the corners of the room all being rounded. It just felt better, more soothing? It's funny. Here in the United States, I find houses with bull-nosed interior walls discomfiting. Something about all the rounded corners causes me mild distress.

E.g. keyboards have a flat or nearly-flat surface so they can be easily cleaned by wiping without leaving any germs behind in a groove, or on an edge. I suppose something similar makes sense in an environment that could produce radioactive dust. reply Y-bar 11 hours agorootparentprevI spent two summers as a cleaner at a pharmaceutical company in my late teens. The \"round corners are easier to clean\" were a thing there as well, reason I was told was that sharp corners will scrape off some residue from the cleaning cloths when you drag them over the corner. reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours agorootparentOh, ya, I can see this being really nice for the kitchen sink or the stand in shower. Right now, oil build up gets trapped in corners that require a brush to work out, which is tricky in the shower where it’s all calked. reply orthoxerox 11 hours agorootparentprevYou know, I remember seeing this on older pictures, but I tried to come up with an example and couldn't, all recent pictures I could find had regular floor moldings. reply stereo 11 hours agorootparentprevYour fridge has no sharp corners inside. reply bombela 10 hours agorootparentMostly because it is injection molded, and that sharp corners on plastics are prone to crack. reply hnlmorg 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s definitely true for some hospitals here in the UK. reply ChoGGi 5 hours agorootparentprevBullnosing drywall isn't much more expensive then square corners? reply philwelch 10 hours agorootparentprevOne of the houses I lived in during college had rounded room corners, and it was a very old house.

I personally prefer the UI that looks like little chunks of titanium and steel rather than the boring flat RGBCMYK-like color palette. It was even in the name, glass, to convey the materiality. I just wonder why developers can have design color palettes like solarized; yet Microsoft imposes its will and subjugates everyone to the same godawful blueness.

I think XP is the best one. Just the fact that it's yellow instead of gray makes all the difference. I hate how modern widgets don't have shading. They're trying to be modern but it just feels very lazy. Note how buttons suddenly became twice as big and there was margin/padding everywhere since Windows Vista/7. It's getting ridiculous how much space UI wastes. reply bsder 12 hours agoparentprevThat image really drives home how much we've lost with flat GUIs are and how important drop shadows are to buttons. And also drives home that I don't give one iota of care about rounded vs square. reply nurbl 11 hours agorootparentIt's also funny how the later examples almost look like they could be terminal UIs.

It was visually quite different from everyone else at the time. reply kmeisthax 1 hour agorootparentNo. iOS switched to squircles because their product designers use squircles[0]. If you extrude a rounded rectangle you get a shape that has harsh breaks in the highlights at the point where the rounded part meets the rectangle part. To smooth this off you need a curve where the tangents are smooth. This is also known as \"C2 continuity\", and you get that level of continuity by ensuring that the second derivative (acceleration) of the curve has no gaps between points. Absolutely none of these properties matter for icons, of course. [0] Or at least some curve with similar tangency properties. reply cat_plus_plus 4 hours agoprevLearning how to design models for 3D printing now, and rounded corners are a matter of necessity as much as aesthetics. Objects with sharp corners are uncomfortable to hold, even risk of injury with some materials. They are also unhygienic and pain to clean dust out of. On the flipside, math to generate rounded corners on arbitrary shapes is messy and printing these out often requires supports and postprocessing to remove those and polish the curves with sandpaper. reply Mikhail_Edoshin 9 hours agoprevOne example of rounded rectangles added purely for aesthetic purposes was the desktop window of the old Mac. When the display turned on during boot, it was naturally square, but then one of the first things the software did was to round its corners. Then they stayed this way until maybe another software switched into full screen. There was nothing like that on Windows and it was obviously a “useless” thing to do.

Except it's only a life-size cardboard cutout of a bear. But behind the cutout is a real bear. Is the philosopher speaking the truth when he points and says there's a bear there? Steve Jobs is appropriately highly praised, but by many people who don't know why he should be praised -- to them he's like a movie sort of figure, Elon Musk in his post-Twitter phase, a larger-than-life jerk who says smart words and allegedly does things. But Jobs actually is that sort of genius that a lot of wannabes pretend to be. So is he highly praised? Is the philosopher telling the truth when he points to the fake bear, having confused it for a real one but not knowing there's a real one behind it? reply lxgr 15 hours agorootparentDoes the philosopher know that there’s a bear behind it?

Of all the narcissists we have running the world, he’s the one I’ll most fondly remember. reply icehawk 16 hours agorootparentMaybe not \"underrated\" but \"Jobs only did marketing, Woz did all the technical work\" is a very persistent comment I see on the internet when he's brought up. reply Turing_Machine 12 hours agorootparentWoz is a technical genius, no doubt about it. But Jobs is who made the boxes something that non-nerds wanted to have in their homes. There were dozens of computer companies at the time, some (not many, but some) of which had Woz-level engineers (e.g. Jay Miner and team at Atari). But only Apple survived. Someone once said there would never have been an Apple if there had been only one Steve, and I agree. Was he a jerk sometimes? Yeah, definitely. But he's not the first genius who's been a jerk. At the extreme, Isaac Newton was a horrible person. reply eru 12 hours agorootparent> But he's not the first genius who's been a jerk. At the extreme, Isaac Newton was a horrible person.

To be there you have to go through a lot of “sure you’ve done well so far, but you’ll never make it to the next level” conversations in your life. By the time you’re Steve Jobs, you’ve been right in the face of doubt thousands of times. Type of thing that makes someone think they can cure easily treatable pancreatic cancer with crystals or whatever. reply cladopa 7 hours agorootparentprevI will not define Jobs as narcissistic (thinking on himself). Quite the opposite, Jobs was focussing on what people needed, and he was right: People needed rounded corners way more than ovals. Jobs was obsessed with the customer experience and that was what made him a great CEO. Did he cared more about the product or the customer than his own people? This is something that you should ask the people that worked with him. reply bityard 2 hours agorootparent> This is something that you should ask the people that worked with him. No need to ask around, lots of people who worked for Jobs have gone on the record as saying he was the worst person they have ever worked for. If you ran into him (or worse, had to present something to him), you never knew if you were going to get Nice Steve or Angry Steve. Nice Steve would thank you for your work and politely inform you of changes or refinements that he wanted you to make. Angry Steve would verbally berate you in front of your manager and peers. He had a set of close associates that he never or rarely treated badly, it is not hyperbole to say that most everyone else got the brunt of his wrath.

In fact it would be really hard to do.\" Why would Bill say this? Why would his ellipse optimization not be trivially applicable to a quarter-circle? reply bhaak 12 hours agoparentI asked the same question years ago. :) The probable answer is that he thought about modeling the rectangle with rounded rects with a single mathematical expression. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15073696 That's probably impossible (as rounded rects are not continuous) but also completely unnecessary as you can handle the quarter circle segments and line segments separately. reply Someone 10 hours agorootparent> as you can handle the quarter circle segments and line segments separately. Possibly, but that is tricky in the presence of blitting modes such as XOR; the movement you accidentally draw a pixel twice, it would get flipped twice (nowadays, with anti-aliasing, it gets really tricky, but they didn’t have that problem yet) You may want to draw the four circle segments in one go, too, as that allows you to share large parts of the computations for what pixels to touch. reply int_19h 1 hour agorootparentThe algorithm used to draw the ellipse should not have any issues with accidentally overdrawing even by a single pixel if your arcs are defined in 90-degree increments. And you can, in fact, draw the four circle segments in one go, since they will all be mirror images of each other. If, instead of the absolute coordinate of the pixel, you compute the offset from the starting point, then you can compute it once, negate it as needed, and draw 4 pixels on each step. reply sircastor 12 hours agoparentprevI think as Andy writes, Bill was showing off a very impressive demo, and was maybe miffed that Steve wasn’t appreciating it. Also, the question had just been sprung, and literally no one had ever done this before. reply int_19h 1 hour agorootparentIs it actually true that \"no-one had ever done this before?\". As far as I know, the midpoint circle algorithm, being a straightforward extension of Bresenham's line algorithm, was already well-known by 1981.

The hack is injecting that code in the Finder. A way to do that is to store the WDEF inside the desktop file on a floppy disk. Then, inserting that floppy would be enough to give new windows that look. The Finder would open the resource fork of that file to get info about files on the floppy and keep it open. When you opened a window, the Finder would ask the Resource Manager for “WDEF #0”, and the Resource Manager would find it (or rather, a WDEF pretending to be ‘it’) in the desktop file.

For example, the newest Framework Laptop 13 has higher resolution screens that come with rounded corners, because whatever supplier had a large stock of them lying around. If it was just software, the concept of having a \"rounded corner screen\" from a supplier wouldn't exist. reply pfg_ 10 hours agorootparentprevI'm pretty sure it's a screen cutout - the corners are still rounded when fullscreen zooming, and on asahi linux. There's also another cutout for the notch at the top of the screen. Also, it's not a great panel and the blacks aren't very good - you can still see light coming from the monitor with a full back image in fullscreen and it changes based on brightness. So if it is software, then it's very low level and with darker blacks than anything else on screen, and has a super tiny bezel right at the corner. I'm pretty sure it's a cutout. reply ralferoo 12 hours agoprevI wasn't even aware that the Mac existed at the time, but I always had a fondness for rounded rectangles because the Amstrad CPC character set had 16 characters that represented all possible combinations of a central dot with N, E, S, W spokes. They were rounded for the 4 cases that represented 90 degrees, and the rounded rectangle look was perfect for using as borders around things. This was 1984, so wouldn't have been long after the original Mac but was maybe influenced by it. As far as I know, no other 8-bit computers have rounded container characters like this. I later used PCs, and the CGA text mode had its nice 1/2 line variants, which were good for variety, but they were square so I never found them as appealing as the rounded ones I knew from the Amstrad. reply waterhouse 19 hours agoprevRelated, fun post: https://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/roundy.html reply WillAdams 19 hours agoprevIt works well for the Mac OS, but for all that it's a core part of the Mac OS identity, I really hate that Microsoft is using round rectangles to the point that device manufacturers are painting the underside of laptop and tablet glass screens so as to cause a physical rounded effect at the corners, and I'd liefer have the crisp square Windows 10 screen appearance than the rounded Windows 11 (though the overall increase in consistency is nice otherwise). reply LoganDark 19 hours agoparentPainting?

You get maybe a few cents based on the physical area that the rounding leaves out. Of course, you can't just pay the few cents for a non-rounded screen if they don't already have masks for non-rounded screens. That's why Framework decided to compromise on the rounded option, as that one had already been commissioned by another customer, but if they wanted the same thing but without rounding they would have had to pay for brand new tooling. reply WillAdams 16 hours agorootparentThat's even worse --- back in the days of the original Mac there were apps which would make use of the dark corners for various status notifications. reply LoganDark 5 hours agorootparentIt's not like you can use the notch for status notifications on phones with a screen cutout.

The round rectangles are still perfectly round. But in the example given, the outline becomes fainter on the rounded sections, because gamma isn't taken into account. In other words, the shape is perfectly correct, but the antialiasing is buggy. (It also has nothing to do with gradient striping -- that's an unavoidable artifact of 24 bit color that has nothing to do with gamma.

Every icon or rectangular element in Apple software and hardware is a squircle. reply roelschroeven 10 hours agoparentHow does that work for rectangular elements? As far as I understand it, squircles are defined by an equation similar to (x/a)^n + (y/b)^n = 1, as in https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yllozptlmt. That works well for squares (a = b), but for rectangles the corners aren't round anymore, they become elliptic, as in https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bzxyu6ygz3. That doesn't like as nice in my eyes, but more importantly I have the impression that the rounded corner of Apple's rectangles are circular, not elliptic. I don't have any Apple devices, but in screenshots like https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*oBI... it seems to me the corners of rectangular elements are very much not elliptic. Or certainly not nearly as obvious as in my second Desmos link. So I don't understand what's really going on. It doesn't seem to me Apple's rectangles really are superellipses. (And actually the squares in that screenshot look like simple rounded squares to me, not squircles/superellipses. The sides look too flat for squircles. I could be wrong though.) reply saagarjha 9 hours agorootparentThey're definitely not superellipses these days, but to answer your question in a more interesting manner: you don't have to stretch the superellipse.

If whatever I am playing with on the system goes haywire, I just restore my system with Timeshift. I've also been giving up on modern gaming, too much enshittification (loot boxes, engagement driven gameplay, messages for modern audiences, etc.) happening lately, but everything I've thrown at Proton ran great. I've been rediscovering the great libraries of retro gaming consoles, especially the DS and 3DS so my computer is actually a workhorse now and my gaming is single player retro bliss. reply mianos 20 hours agoprevAt least a Mac alllows you to have a local account without iCloud.

Assuming you're logging in with a Microsoft account, and assuming you have a OneDrive account, it's a better experience to set up the folder backup feature as early as possible in the set-up process. If you really don't want it, it's easy to undo. I still don't like being forced to log in with a Microsoft account as part of the set-up. I prefer to log in locally, and then incrementally turn on the cloud features. But I've voted with my wallet and have moved to Linux and macOS for day-to-day desktop computing.

Are we really talking about those images as saluatory no matter what comes next? I'm imagining Jesus portraying The Prodigal Son stumbling home with syphilitic, eyes sunken, hair coming out in patches, teeth falling out from malnutrition. Or Sunday School dioramas of the animals exiting the ark walking past bloated, reeking corpses of people and animals left by the receding ocean. Or the children doing a little skit for the whole church during which the ark has been sealed up and children outside act out drowning. Because, you know, that's the cold truth. I still recall the horrible time I had going to sleep as a seven yr old after watching the Wicked Witch of the West. I'm picturing a group of kids to walk to school, past storm drains. The day after watching a murderous clown reaching out to drag a kid into the wet underground. Archetypes aplenty there. I affirm communicating to kids at age appropriate levels...in part dictated by their developing capacities to take the lessons on board...of Truth, Mystery, meaning out of the seeming chaos of the world surrounding us. I do not believe the author makes her case that the original stories gathered and published in 1812 ought to be treated as some sort of quasi-sacred texts. I believe that kids of 2024 get enough to be anxious about. Linda wilson 6 days ago This is wonderful. I agree that fairy tales are important. I designed an online course on fairy tales connecting them to “high culture.” Brunhilde and Siegfried in Wagner’s “Ring” is a Sleeping Beauty story. “Romeo and Juliet is a “Sleeping Beauty” story that goes off the rails. Juliet is kissed by Romeo but doesn’t wake up until after Romeo Kills himself, a lesson in patience perhaps. “The Firebird”, “Swan Lake (“Beauty and the Beast”)” “The Magic Flute” are all fairy tales. Shakespeare’s “A Winter’s Tale” is a “”Sleeping Beauty” story, “The Tempest” a ‘Sorcerer’s apprentice” story. “Cyrano de Bergerac” is a kind of “Beaty and the Beast” story. The course tries to point out how embedded in our culture fairy tales are. But parents won’t enroll their students in the course because they see fairy tales and assume the course is something childish (the course is for high school students). Fairy tales do get a bad rap. Maria Tatar in “The Heroine with a Thousand Faces” takes on Joseph Campbell’s definition of the hero as always a male. Tatar writes in her introduction: JOSEPH CAMPBELL wrote The Hero with a Thousand Faces while teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. His classes on comparative mythology at the then all-women’s school were in such high demand that he was soon obliged to limit enrollment to seniors. During his last year of teaching there, one of those seniors walked into his office, sat down, and said: “Well, Mr. Campbell, you’ve been talking about the hero. But what about the women?” The startled professor raised his eyebrows and replied, “The woman’s the mother of the hero; she’s the goal of the hero’s achieving; she’s the protectress of the hero; she is this, she is that. What more do you want?” “I want to be the hero,” she announced. Thanks for this. John Wilson, Jr. Henry Lewis 6 days ago This is fantastic. I think you are on to something essential and true. Thank you for writing this. During Flannery O’Connor’s childhood, the future author had a creative way of weeding out any unsatisfactory playmates who had been chosen by her mother as respectable society. O’Connor would read Grimms’ Fairy Tales aloud to her guests. Some were too frightened by the stories to ever return to the O’Connor house in Savannah (which suited their hostess just fine). Any girl who loved the fairy tales passed young O’Connor’s test. A kindred spirit had been found. Classic fairy tales aren’t for the faint of heart. It’s not hard to see their influence on O’Connor’s disturbing and shocking southern gothic fiction that includes such horrors as serial killers waiting by the side of rural roads, ready to murder selfish grandmothers. The stories compiled by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm include their fair share of violence and twisted crimes: men who chop young women up into pieces, a father who lusts after his own daughter, and many, many characters who make deals with the devil himself. Today children are often only familiar with sanitized versions of the Grimm Brothers’ stories. Arthur Rackham, Illustration of “Hansel and Gretel,” a well-known German folktale from the Brothers Grimm, 1909. Hans Christian Andersen’s classic fairy tales have also been adjusted over the years for a more sensitive audience. When I found his version of “The Little Mermaid” at the library as a young girl, I was surprised but fascinated by the stark differences from the Disney film. The prince in Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid” marries someone else. And the mermaid’s bargain with the sea-witch results in a desperate choice: die when the sun rises after his wedding night or murder her beloved in his bridal chamber. While there are moments of suspense and danger in Disney’s The Little Mermaid, it’s hard to imagine bubbly Ariel with her bouncing red bangs and a knife in hand, trying to decide whether to fatally stab lovable himbo Prince Eric. Such a dark scene, although not uncommon in the realm of classic fairy tales, would have been considered too distressing for young viewers. In an effort to make the story more palatable, Disney’s Cinderella does not include the details of Cinderella’s stepsisters chopping off their heels and toes to fit their bloody, mutilated feet into the glass slipper in greedy pursuit of the throne or getting their eyes pecked out by birds in a final stroke of justice, as the Grimms’ version describes. But is this Disneyfication of these tales a good or a bad thing? Fairy tales are stories that are told to children and set in a world of magic. As twentieth-century educator Annemarie Wächter put it, “Children and fairy tales are inseparable – one cannot be imagined without the other.” Fairy tales are beloved by children partly because they are tales of action. Rather than revolving around the inner thoughts and motivations of nuanced characters, they are concerned with what happens next, what the characters (often archetypes) do. They are more than mere fables with a snappy moral (think Aesop) because their meaning transcends clearcut lessons. Instead, they are full of mystery. There is room inside these tales for the child to explore fairyland: a strange and dangerous world in which she can practice overcoming her fears by journeying alongside the hero. And at the end of the tale, everything is set right. As Wächter puts it, “Fairy tales can often be brutal and cruel – people and animals die – and yet, despite everything, the positive powers always win. There can be no other ending.” Fairy tales take both evil and goodness quite seriously. In other words, they are truthful. As Madeleine L’Engle claimed, “The world of fairy tale, fantasy, myth, is inimical to the secular world, and in total opposition to it, for it is interested not in limited laboratory proofs, but in truth.” And in their embrace of truth, fairy tales wrestle with darkness and end in triumph. But are we willing to tell children the truth by reading them fairy tales, as Flannery O’Connor did to her playmates? It seems that these days we are more comfortable if we alter them either by softening the darkness in the story or, as we see in much young adult literature, rejecting the possibility of happily ever after. Disney’s Cinderella does not include the details of Cinderella’s stepsisters chopping off their heels and toes to fit their bloody, mutilated feet into the glass slipper in greedy pursuit of the throne or getting their eyes pecked out by birds in a final stroke of justice, as the Grimms’ version describes. But is this Disneyfication of these tales a good or a bad thing? While protecting the innocence of children by sheltering them from overly gruesome material is something all good parents seek to do, have we swung so far in our attempt to protect children that we don’t tell stories that help them process dark things? While we haven’t always been so leery of the violence in fairy tales, in this strange age we subject our children to drills at their schools to prepare them for active shooters in the classroom but consider them too fragile to be told stories that take evil and death seriously. Is this sheltering from the classic grit of fairy tales benefiting them, or are these just the sort of stories they need to be able to endure the violence that hangs like a shadow over our world? The fairy tale acknowledges that parents do not always love and care for their children as they ought, that loved ones die and leave us alone and grieving, that evil is real and often powerful, and that violence and sin are present in our world. All these truths make grownups uncomfortable; we are eager to smooth over a child’s fears with comforting falsehoods. “Don’t worry, nothing is going to happen to me,” a mother might say when her child is distraught at the thought of her mortality. But the child knows that sometimes mothers die and his mother is no different. Children are wise enough to be afraid of death, loss, and danger – after all, these are frightening things. The question is whether we allow them to wrestle well with these fears or not. British writer G. K. Chesterton famously wrote, “The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a Saint George to kill the dragon.” If we spend our efforts trying to convince a child that the dragons of life can’t hurt him, we not only fail to tell the truth, we fail to show him that dragons do not have the last word. And the child longs to be equipped to face the monsters he fears, whether dragons or death. While classic fairy tales are maligned by some for being too realistic and unsettling in acknowledging the reality of evil, they are also criticized for being too unrealistic for their final hopeful resolutions. “I won’t read my daughter fairy tales!” I’ve been told by concerned parents. “She might think Prince Charming is coming to save her and she’ll only be disappointed when she wakes up to the real world.” These critics are willing to leave the dragon in the story but want to remove Saint George. The endings of classic fairy tales are considered too rosy for a child’s consumption. Perhaps robbing young children of the world of fairyland where they can face the monsters they fear results in an inevitable overcorrection, as the explosion of dystopian YA fiction might suggest. Many such books see the world through a lens of despair, defeat, and mistrust, overrun with dragons with no Saint George in sight. A belief that despair is the only realistic response to the nature of the world leads to narratives like Game of Thrones, which presents a universe where there is neither good nor evil, just the unquenchable thirst for power that motivates every soul. Even in stories for younger kids – A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example – we see the fairy tale turned on its head. In this series the orphaned Baudelaire children are never given the happily ever after they deserve. In Grimms’ Fairy Tales the heroes or heroines sometimes encounter helpers along the way, or they might meet manipulators or liars. In this they are realistic. And there is the understanding that the world is not merely dark; both good and evil people inhabit it, but there are some worth trusting. But the Baudelaires can trust no one. The adults they encounter are either too weak to help them or are secretly trying to harm them. Another trend of subverted fairy tale is the apologia for a villain, such as Disney’s Maleficent, in which the evil sorceress becomes the sympathetic victim. In these stories both evil and goodness are removed from the tale. The villain’s evil is explained away, the hero’s goodness revealed to be a farce. And yet, while these kinds of stories are undeniably popular, it is notable that the series that has recently captured the imagination of children (and even adults) most deeply is a modern fairy tale that includes both wrestling with evil and death and a happily ever after: J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter, a story, like Grimms’ Fairy Tales, with an indisputably Christian framework. Every human being understands the world and his place in it through narratives. God wires us to be formed by story; Jesus himself tells parables to teach his disciples. It is of the highest importance that we consider what stories we are telling our young people. What character do they think they are in the story of their lives? And what kind of world is their story set in? Is it a world in which greed and power will be ultimately triumphant? Is it a world in which love and goodness hold any sway? Could the dread that seems to plague our young people be not merely a reaction to the brokenness of our world but our failure to communicate that the universe will ultimately be set right as both fairy tales and the gospel promise? After all, as the theologian Vigen Guroian beautifully puts it in his fantastic book Tending the Heart of Virtue, “Fairy tales lead us toward a belief in something that, if it were not also so veiled in a mystery, common sense alone would affirm: if there is a story, there must surely be a storyteller.” And in this lies our deepest hope. The fairy tale acknowledges that parents do not always love and care for their children as they ought, that loved ones die and leave us alone and grieving, that evil is real and often powerful, and that violence and sin are present in our world. All these truths make grownups uncomfortable; we are eager to smooth over a child’s fears with comforting falsehoods. To combat both the anxiety that comes to children robbed of the space to confront evil and the despair that holds that the last chapter of humanity’s tale is final defeat, we have to offer truer stories. Early in life, children need to be steeped in fairy tales that don’t gloss over the dark and ugly parts of the world. Children are wise; they reject the false advertising of cheap positive thinking for the real prize of hard-won hope. For a message of hope to be received, it must be hope that shines in darkness, hope that breaks the witch’s spell. “It is the mark of a good fairy-story,” J. R. R. Tolkien writes in his essay “On Fairy-Stories,” “that however wild its events, however fantastic or terrible the adventures, it can give to child or man that hears it, when the ‘turn’ comes, a catch of the breath, a beat and lifting of the heart, near to (or indeed accompanied by) tears.” But to tell such stories, we have to believe they are true. If we grown-ups don’t believe there is, as Tolkien calls it, “joy beyond the walls of the world,” then our children will not believe us when we share fairy tales that end with hope. And if we offer narratives of a world without hope, our stories are no better than the sanitized tales that refuse to acknowledge mortality and evil. They are simply a different way of failing to tell the whole truth. But happily ever afters may be difficult to envision without an eternal perspective. At the end of Andersen’s story, the little mermaid loses her life and her body disintegrates into sea foam on the surface of the waves. But her sacrifice for her beloved is rewarded by the chance to gain a human soul and therefore to experience eternal life. This ending is only hopeful accompanied by a belief in an afterlife, just as Flannery O’Connor’s “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” only ends “happily” with a salvific outpouring of grace if we see eternal hope for the murdered grandmother. Perhaps it’s the loss of this eternal perspective that prevents us from seeing beyond darkness to hope. “Deprive children of stories,” warns philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, “and you leave them unscripted, anxious stutterers in their actions as in their words.” Like Hansel and Gretel leaving their little white pebbles along their path into the dark forest, the next generation needs us to provide them with touchstones that can keep them from getting lost on their journey and help them find their way back home. These pathfinders are the stories they’re told, stories that light up the dark, that reveal the existence of dragons hiding in the caves of life, and remind us that Saint George will be ultimately triumphant, even when it seems all hope is lost.

    "commentBody": "The case for not sanitising fairy tales (plough.com)268 points by crapvoter 23 hours agohidepastfavorite300 comments bunderbunder 2 hours agoI hate when people use the word \"sanitize\" in this context. For one, it's a weasel word and needlessly moralistic. But, even more than that, when people write essays complaining about sanitizing classic stories, most of what they succeed in communicating to me is that they don't actually understand how literature works. Adjusting older stories to reflect contemporary cultural values has been happening for as long as there have been stories. The reason for that is simple: one of stories' major functions is to express things about ourselves - lessons, observations, etc. When an element gets dropped from a story, it's because that element is no longer culturally relevant, plain and simple. Stories, too, need to choose between evolution and extinction. Take an oft-bemoaned example: Disney's version of the Little Mermaid. It's a very good adaptation. Adaptation. It differs from Hans Christian Anderson's in part because the lessons we think are important to teach our kids are different. But also, the medium itself affects things: children's movies don't have to be as graphic to achieve the same excitement level and emotional impact as written stories with few or zero pictures. A movie that didn't change anything from the original version of the story wouldn't have had nearly the same cultural impact, because it wouldn't have been nearly as good. reply austin-cheney 3 minutes agoparentSure, like cautiously removing key words from Huckleberry Finn because words matter and its more important that people consume less Xanax than accurately reflect on the contemporary nature of historical setting in its linguistic context. Really though, its sanitizing. Even sanitize is too nice a word. Why not just call it what it is: selective censorship. Its pulling a Tipper Gore so that you can pretend to be a carefully concerned liberal in full hyper conservative hypocrisy[1][2].

Oral stories were naturally updated with each generation, and I think that's wonderful. However, in this case, we're discussing literature being adapted by a global corporation with shareholders aiming to please a broad audience. If Disney were to adapt The Lord of the Rings in 100 years to reflect new \"lessons,\" I would be relieved to no longer be around to see it. reply sirspacey 20 minutes agorootparentThe adaptation was by a group of screenwriters, story tellers, and artists.

It’s a real phenomenon, and it is genuinely motivated by changing cultural precepts. And it is unfortunate, something about ourselves is lost in the process. Is it in the best interests of civilization? It may be. But not always. reply bunderbunder 1 hour agorootparentI think that I couldn't disagree more with this point. Riffing and building on existing cultural artifacts does not erase them. Nobody's telling Hans Christian Andersen to shut up, and nobody's telling publishers to stop publishing him, and readership of The Snow Queen - the original version - is presumably much greater now than it was in 2012. My kids have specifically asked for it, while I wasn't even aware it existed as a child. On the other hand, the implied message of people who complain about modern retellings is that they should not exist. (What else can it be?) And if they have their way, something absolutely would be lost: the ability of these stories to continue to participate in living culture. reply samatman 36 minutes agorootparent> Nobody's telling Hans Christian Andersen to shut up, and nobody's telling publishers to stop publishing him Do Dr. Seuss next. reply bunderbunder 29 minutes agorootparentA commercial decision to bury a set of works, made by the corporation that owns the exclusive rights to Dr. Seuss's creative output, falls into a completely different conceptual category, and bringing it up here is the kind of whataboutism that only serves to muddy the waters. Or, to put it another way, invoking a concrete example of the kind of cultural loss that's an inevitable result of the ongoing erosion of the public domain does not actually function very well as a counterpoint to a defense of one of the primary virtues of having a vigorous public domain. reply babypuncher 14 minutes agorootparentprevI don't think we really lose anything about ourselves unless we are going back and changing the original work. The Hans Christian Anderson version of The Little Mermaid is still readily available. For thousands of years, stories, myths, and legends were handed down through oral tradition and changed radically over time. The key difference today is that anyone with basic literacy and access to a library or the internet can go back and see old \"versions\" of these stories. reply cm11 1 hour agoparentprevGood point. It’s just that some weirdness arises as stories (or adaptations) begin to pass as originals, which I think happens by default. More effort to not take the thing at face value, more effort to asterisk every story you tell. Sanitizing is sorta like politeness in its (usually mild) degree of dishonesty. We tend to accept this level and sometimes praise it. Both also usually add slight bias towards the teller’s needs. Even the idea of telling _the_ story of Cinderella vs _a_ story of Cinderella adds a not necessarily warranted suggestion of what people hundreds of years ago moralized and embellishes it with a kind of “time-tested” truth of humans. reply bunderbunder 38 minutes agorootparentThe thing is, though, that there's no such thing as an \"original\" when we're talking about folkloric fairy tales. People give way too much deference to the first person who happened to get his own version of a story into print, typically imposing their own middle- or upper-class sensibilities onto it in the process. Those versions deserve respect as literary and scholarly works, but they neither require nor merit actual deference. Rich people using public domain stories as a vehicle for for-profit moralizing in the 18th or 19th centuries is not inherently more laudable than rich people using public domain stories as a vehicle for for-profit moralizing in the 20th or 21st centuries. reply sltkr 19 hours agoprevIt's interesting that the article mentions Hans Christian Andersen's “The Little Mermaid” as an example of a story that was “sanitized” by removing the part where Ariel is forced to choose between killing her prince or turning into foam on the waves. But Andersen's story was itself a sanitized version of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's “Undine”, a fairy/morality tale in which a water spirit marries a human knight in order to gain an immortal soul. In that story, her husband ultimately breaks his wedding vows, forcing Undine to kill him, and losing her chance of going to heaven. Andersen explicitly wrote that he found that ending too depressing, which is why he made up his whole bit about Ariel refusing to kill Prince Erik, and instead of dying, she turned into a spirit of the air, where if she does good deeds for 300 years, she's eventually allowed to go to heaven after all. Even as a child, it felt like a cop-out to me. But my point was: “The Little Mermaid” is itself a sanitized version of the original novella, adapted to the author's modern sensibilities. reply dirkt 13 hours agoparent> But Andersen's story was itself a sanitized version of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's “Undine” Now I got curious.

Not one of the stories in this old book resembled anything in any modern telling. E.g. There were several versions of Cinderella-like stories all different, with entirely different endings, some with no ending. Different slippers or no slippers. One or two or three sisters.

The original is more an allegory about how changing everything about yourself is actually bad than the fairy tale romance that Disney pitches, which is not AT ALL what I expected. There's real benefit to exposing kids to darker themes (my eldest loves a book that kills its main character's father on the second page, and after she recovered from being a little weepy about it, it became one of her favorites), but there's also merit to letting the kids choose to hit pause on scary/disturbing/whatever themes until they're in a place to deal with it. Showing your kids The Two Towers might have a really positive impact on them at the right time, but only if they're mature enough that it doesn't lead to e.g. bed-wetting levels of dis-regulation. reply epolanski 8 hours agoparent> \"it's totally ok to change everything about yourself to win the affection of a boy you literally just met\" Meanwhile I always taught that the underlying message of The Lion King to be insane and it seems like I'm the only one: - don't do what you want but what society/religion tells you to do (Simba is happy with Timon and Pumba, but then they send other animals including the monkey shaman to tell him he has to fight his uncle) - your destiny is decided at birth - there are tier all tiers of living creatures (eating a pig => bad, eating insects => okay cause they don't talk) and genetics decide it I'm not against cancelling it by the way, I just find the message of the film...insane. reply hot_gril 2 minutes agorootparentI'm fine with the message of Lion King aside from the destiny thing, also the movie is boring. What I noticed about other Disney prince/princess movies is they don't really have a message. Beauty and the Beast is explicitly that \"true beauty is on the inside,\" and the disagreement with Gaston is about how women don't have to be housewives I guess, but the main character Belle ends up with a good-looking prince in a huge castle with servants in the end anyway. Even Shrek showed the first one better, having both stay as ogres. Hunchback of Notre Dame is also about true beauty being on the inside, but the girl goes off with prince charming in the end anyway, not the hunchback who saved her. However, I give it points for having a complex antagonist who thinks he's upholding the law but is actually hypocritical and destructive. The Little Mermaid, someone else already said how it contradicts itself. Cinderella, I don't even know what the point was supposed to be, it just seems like a girl romance movie. reply joshuahedlund 4 hours agorootparentprev> - don't do what you want but what society/religion tells you to do (Simba is happy with Timon and Pumba, but then they send other animals including the monkey shaman to tell him he has to fight his uncle) Interesting interpretation.

For all the perfectly valid flaws in Disney movies, this one is far off the mark that I don't understand how it's become so popular, or why even Disney themselves leaned into it. Ariel in the Disney movie is obsessed with \"land culture\" long before she ever meets Eric or \"falls in love\". She has a massive collection of trinkets and artifacts, of which she only has as surface level understanding at best, and a flawed mistranslated one at worst. She's missing family functions for her obsession. She is basically a \"weeb\" for human culture. Yes, she gets herself love struck when she goes to the surface, but she already wanted to be up there. Her \"I want\" song comes before she's ever laid eyes on Eric. She's got plans to move, and she's already chafing under her father. Falling \"in love\" with Eric might be the instigating incident, but she already wants to make a change and get up there. Also bear in mind that she doesn't know anything about Eric at all, she's not \"changing herself to win the affections of a boy she just met\", they haven't met at all. She's obsessed and made up a fantasy in her head. Again to continue with the weeb analogy, this is like a hypothetical weeb going to an \"Atarashii Gakko\" concert and deciding they're in love with one of the singers and they're moving to Japan to be with them. It has nothing to do with \"love\" or \"affection\" and it's all about the obsession. Ursula leverages this and the recent fights Ariel has had with Triton to trick her into signing the contract, but again this is about fueling an unrequited (and unknown) obsession, not about trying to do something that she has any reason to believe Eric would be asking of her. And then the ENTIRE rest of the movie drives home the point that she doesn't need to change anything about herself. Remember, Eric is obsessed, with a girl with a pretty voice. He doesn't think Ariel is the girl he's interested in at all. But he falls \"in love\" with her, the person she is, no changes required. Her lack of voice isn't whats appealing to him. Her legs aren't what's appealing to him. It's her personality, her whole self and she's limited to only being able to express herself as herself via her personality because her captivating voice (and the thing Eric supposedly was in love with) she'd given up. In the end the message isn't \"change yourself to win affection\" it's quite literally \"you are good enough as you are for the right person, even when/if your 'love at first sight' attributes (like your singing voice) are lost\" If one's kids come away from Little Mermaid believing it's ok to change themselves for someone else's affections, one needs to make sure those kids are getting more critical media analysis practice, and maybe also a few sit down talks on their feelings of inadequacy. reply sgift 11 hours agorootparentThanks for spelling this out. I always thought the same, even as a child when I first saw the film: Ariel has a deep feeling of not belonging where she is combined with a yearning for human culture. It's obvious from the movie that her falling in with the prince is just the last step in a long line of \"I should be up there, not down here\" and not just some spur of the moment decision. reply petsfed 17 minutes agorootparentI'll concede that its less \"give up your voice and everything about yourself for a boy\" and more \"give up your voice and everything about yourself for this way of life that you are clearly irrationally obsessed over and don't understand at all\". But its also made clear via the voice subplot that her mad dash to separate herself from who she was to begin with is itself a source of conflict. Certainly, don't ignore the voice in your head that says \"this isn't the place for you\", but also accept that the change needs to happen slower than you want, for a variety of good reasons. I suppose there's an interpretation of Disney's The Little Mermaid where its an allegory for LGBTQ (especially trans) kids. But even then, it mixes its metaphors by adding in the romantic subplot. Luca does a much MUCH better job of balancing the two worlds, because the happy ending is \"gets to be human\" and not \"gets to be human, so they can get married to the person they met a 4 days ago\". The Little Mermaid really muddies the water (pardon the pun) by adhering to that aspect of the old story. And while I have considerable misgivings about introducing the happily-ever-after romantic ending to 5 year olds, Disney does manage to get it more correct: Beauty and the Beast shows the (potentially problematic) relationship between Belle and the Beast developing over time, as they get to know each other. Tangled has the love story as ancillary to the main story of getting out from under the thumb of an abusive parental figure. Even Sleeping Beauty expends a lot of screentime to show how the love story specifically contradicts the arranged marriage to be (although its all for naught, since they were arranged to be married to each other anyway). Its just that The Little Mermaid piles up a lot of unsubtle allegory and doesn't even attempt to mitigate it. reply sapling-ginger 14 hours agoparentprev> but there's also merit to letting the kids choose to hit pause Why is there a \"but\" there? Nobody is implying that children should be strapped to a chair with their eyelids propped open with toothpicks so that they have to watch all the gory details of a horror movie. reply petsfed 56 minutes agorootparentLooking at the original article, that was for sure the subtext (especially in light of the fact that its coming from an unapologetically Christian source). Their pushback seems to be \"parents are trying too hard to protect kids from disturbing images/themes\", but also (quoting directly here) \"have we swung so far in our attempt to protect children that we don’t tell stories that help them process dark things?\" I resonate strongly with the idea that children today are sheltered too much from how the world really is. But I definitely disagree with the idea that we should force them to listen to those \"truths\" when they can tell for themselves that they aren't able to deal with them. The article expends a lot of words on the idea that good and evil are atomic unto themselves, and not at least partially determined by both outcome, intent, and method. I guarantee that kids in general, and my kids specifically, won't be helped by hearing about (as expressed in the article) Cinderella's step-sisters hacking off their toes and heels to fit into the glass slipper. There are loads of other tropes in classic fairy tales that I'm also uncomfortable with; physical beauty is a reflection of inner beauty, step-mothers are always cruel to their step children, princesses (or marriages in general) as prizes for the heroic feats of princes/knights errant/other adventurers, etc. Fairy tales often seem needlessly cruel given the current state of our society, and they also pack in a lot of warning messages that just don't apply anymore, and clinging to them is itself harmful to kids. reply thaumasiotes 19 hours agoparentprev> The original is more an allegory about how changing everything about yourself is actually bad than the fairy tale romance that Disney pitche I thought the main message of the original was \"mermaids don't have souls\".

In each story the protagonist should embrace a logic fallacy that justifies the punishment.

The point of the article is that life is like (the authors' conception of) an unsanitized Grimms' fairy tale: it's full of horrors, but has a happy ending, namely an afterlife in paradise and the final defeat of all types of evil. The authors especially love the HCA Little Mermaid, since she manages to acquire a soul and become saved, though I didn't notice any discussion of the homosexuality / transsexuality aspects of that tale (dunno whether they're the type of Christian who object to those things or not). IMHO in America today there is a significant problem of \"fairy-tale thinking\", especially among certain American Christian groups. The issue is not that fairy tales teach that a happy ending is possible, but rather that it often comes almost entirely through external deliverance. The same is true within specifically Evangelical theology, in which salvation is entirely by God's grace through your faith, and not at all through your actions. So while some millenials and zoomers struggle with despair about e.g. climate change because they believe that no happy ending is realistically possible, certain other people believe that it will \"just work out somehow\", e.g. there will be a miracle of technology, or global warming will turn out to be good or whatever, which is IMHO even less helpful.

I see that the emphasis on what to censor lays on violence (ex: hero cutting the head of the dragon, chopping off toes to fit in shoe, stabbing the groom) but that never bothered me as a kid, I barely noticed that to be honest.

I don't want my kids to see such stories as examples. When I read my old childhood books I often need to catch myself, or explain a context to my children I'm pretty sure they are unable to grasp.

He says that stories are like a rollercoaster. You go through the scary stuff because you know that everything turns out fine in the end. When he made a slightly unhappy ending, readers were pissed and would write letters to him, telling him to write a sequel to that story to give it a proper ending. Bad endings cheat the young reader out of the experience they wanted. I'd think most of the sanitized stories are just that -- they're seen as incomplete/wrong endings rather than inappropriate.

[2] In America, Czech cartoons somewhat unfairly have the reputation for being weird, because a dozen Tom & Jerry episodes were made in Prague in the early 1960s in very weird circumstances, on a shoe-string budget by animators unaccustomed to the very idea of violent cartoons. [3] These were received with some confusion by the American audience in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis. From this you then have consequent parodies like The Simpsons' Worker and Parasite, which - though not exactly a fair reflection of Czech animation - is absolutely hilarious.

Sure, all fairy tales have oral origins, and with Grimm you even various translations over the years. Nevertheless, me, my parents, and their parents were all reading basically the same thing, and often the exact same book. That is, the books have been around over 150 years and have become canon in their own right. It is the sanitization of those books that people are objecting to.

They suggested that when you see a problematic representation in your kids media not to hide it, but note it “That doesn’t seem very fair to be judged only by ” and if there’s time engage the kid “what do you think?” It gives a natural way to talk about the problems while also showing good examples of how they might come up in the kids life. You can also do the inverse. Remove the gnarly reference and then introduce a surrogate conversation with possibly easier to understand plots or themes. Later when they are older you can, and should, talk to them about how the differences and ask what they think. Ask them to come up with a different change and think how that might influence the reader.

The article also mentions modern series and YA novels that have in some ways even bleaker themes, and I think there's nothing wrong with a feel good Disney story either. I think there is a tendency for parents to excessively avoid letting their children be afraid, instead of providing a safe place to experience fear, and these older stories didn't shy away from those themes and so can be useful for bringing some of that safe fear back for children. reply slg 19 hours agoparentprevYou don't have to go back that far to fairy tales and oral traditions for this to be true.

Relatedly, recently an image appeared on Facebook of the character Lady Elaine Fairchilde as she appears in Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood; both her ugly face and her irascible attitude are considerably toned down. It only made me miss the original version of Elaine from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood all the more. Fred Rogers was not one to shy away from the ugly feelings we all feel from time to time; and Elaine's original design draws heavily from the Punch and Judy tradition (which itself could have very dark and scary themes whilst still being entertainment for children, and itself has been toned down).

Fairy tales with disturbing themes were a good way to safely introduce the real world to children.

I'm prone to bouts of depression but that's probably got more to do with reading too much news and chronically overextending myself. reply andrewflnr 21 hours agorootparentprevI don't think that's a sound prediction. There are lots of kinds of mental illness, and at least in my view the ones in question are mostly depression, anxiety and the like. Not exactly famous for producing violent outbursts, and a lot of people get treated, which cuts down on suicide. Besides, I don't know if I would trust historical stats for suicide, but whatever. Also the GP comment was arguably more about sanitized childhood in general, which is a more gradual trend than starting at the 1900s exactly. reply tptacek 21 hours agorootparentThe reason you look at suicide and violent crime is that they're clear indicators. Diagnosis of mental illness is not: definitions, diagnostic techniques, and access to diagnoses have changed radically over the last 100 years. It's similar (though less rigorous, for several reasons) to homicide being the gold standard crime statistic. I'm not making a claim that mental health doesn't matter if it doesn't result in suicide or incarceration. I'm saying: those are two sets of numbers you can find going back to the intervention (the sanitization of fairy tales) and trace since then. The story those numbers tells doesn't match the just-so story the comment provides. Maybe there's more going on than those numbers represents! But I think you'll have a tough time supporting that argument with facts. For instance: the claim was made across the thread that suicide levels were artificially suppressed in 1900 because of religious norms, which works against the story; moreover: you can see in the actual charts what suicide tracks with (it's not a smooth line). reply jackpirate 21 hours agorootparentI think you're wrong. Suicide does not have stable reporting rates. It was very stigmatized in the past, and so investigators would notoriously report suicides as \"unknown cause of death\" if they could. Violent crime, on the other hand, is much more correlated with things like poverty than with mental health. I think it's quite obviously the case that there are no clear indicators about what \"mental health\" looked like 100 years ago and there. Any projections into the past will involve a lot of extrapolation and have all sorts of biases. reply lmm 21 hours agorootparentprev> I'm not making a claim that mental health doesn't matter if it doesn't result in suicide or incarceration.

Are you claiming that your statistics mean there is no significant downturn in mental health, or not? reply tptacek 19 hours agorootparentNo, that doesn't hold. I'm not addressing that at all. For the previous commenter to be correct, the trend should start with the intervention, which occurred in/around 1900. reply andrewflnr 18 hours agorootparentI've already hinted at why that's not a very strong prediction either. Sanitizing fairy tales are only one part of a broader trend toward sheltering children in general, which, to my knowledge at least, did not start at exactly the same time. The changes in mental health would track with the intensity of the broader trend, with a time lag of around 20 years. Yes, these are both very difficult to measure.

I think that in the case of the ESP32-S3, its SIMD instructions are designed to accelerate the inference of quantized AI models (see: https://github.com/espressif/esp-dl), and also some signal processing like FFTs. I guess you could call the SIMD instructions TPU-like, in the sense that the chip has specific instructions that facilitates ML inference (EE.VRELU.Sx performs the ReLU operation). Using these instructions will still take away CPU time where TPUs are typically their own processing core, operating asynchronously. I’d say this is closer to ARM NEON. reply implements 9 hours agorootparent> The FAST feature detector is an algorithm for finding regions of an image that are visually distinctive, … Is that related to ‘Energy Function’ in any way? (I ask because a long time ago I was involved in an Automated Numberplate Reading startup that was using an FPGA to quickly find the vehicle numberplate in an image) reply ska 49 minutes agorootparentWhat you are thinking of operates at a different level of abstraction. Energy functions are a general way of structuring a problem, used (sometimes abused) to apply an optimization algorithm to find a reasonable solution for it. FAST is an algorithm for efficiently looking for \"interesting\" parts (basically, corners) of an image, so you can safely (in theory) ignore the rest of it. The output from a feature detector may end up contributing to an energy function later, directly or indirectly. reply kylixz 14 hours agorootparentprevInterested in doing more of this type of work optimizing a SLAM/factorgraph pipeline?

    "originBody": "Earlier quite a few iDOS users and supporters reached out to me to let me know about the recent AppStore policy change (Thanks, EU). In light of this, I decided to resubmit iDOS. However, it looks like Apple has blacklisted iDOS 2, preventing me from even requesting a review under that title, and I had to submit under a brand new title \"iDOS 3\". Here's where things got interesting. Initially they rejected the submission because it was same as iDOS 2, but after I explained to them that I can not continue under iDOS2, then they rejected again as \"Design spam\" on the basis that there has been many submissions lately with the exact same design. I don't actually care much about the copycats, but just can't understand why it's difficult for Apple to check my account history and tell which is the original. It's a little bit insulting that I had to tell the story to them time and time again and yet the issue is unresolved after 1 week. For the people that are waiting, I am hopeful that we will sort it out eventually. And if everything indeed goes well, there will be updates coming to justify this version bump. Update 2024-05-08: \"Your app is in review but is requiring additional time.\" Makes me wonder if the reviewer is trying to play a game through. Update 2024-06-15: Got a call from Apple after 2 months. They have decided that iDOS is not a retro game console, so the new rule is not applicable. They suggested I make changes and resubmit for review, but when I asked what changes I should make to be compliant, they had no idea, nor when I asked what a retro game console is. It's still the same old unreasonable answer along the line of \"we know it when we see it\".",

Notarization is a reasonable implementation, and it can even require some form of developer identification, it just can't be very deep identification, an e-mail address is enough (along with IP and other metadata gathered during the process). That way they can disable all apps signed by one developer, and can more quickly react to malicious actors, without it becoming a problem for normal users. reply Someone 9 hours agorootparent> nothing is stopping a malware vendor from literally never reusing app IDs.

I expect the typical malware writer will easily find a way to have a unique “e-mail address (along with IP and other metadata gathered during the process)”. Because of that, “That way they can disable all apps signed by one developer” will not be possible. reply rekoil 6 hours agorootparentYes, but all attempts at circumventing the system will give Apple more information about their behaviour. If 1000 different users are requesting to sign the same (or only slightly differing) IPA within a short period of time, from different IPs and different emails, it's a good indicator that something fishy is going on. reply cageface 15 hours agorootparentprevThe requirement for a hardened runtime certainly supports this point of view. reply isodev 12 hours agoparentprevIndeed, the entire app store review is just a facade for Apple's market grabbing practices.

The easiest example would be comms indicating that Apple is detecting malicious behaviors (spam, fraud, abuse, etc) in the app. Disclosing information what can (and implicitly what cannot be detected) is self defeating. There are literally hundreds of reasonable variations in these situations. I think what is effective is that all violations where the creator is working in good faith to abide by guidelines should be treated with reasonable transparency about how the conclusion Apple came to was reached. What fraction of Apple devs are working in good faith? Obviously the vast majority. So therefore most rejections should have clear rationale. reply realusername 12 hours agorootparentThey won't provide any rationale the same way a justice court in a dictatorship doesn't need to refer to actual laws to justify their decision.

So what, in a proper court of law all evidence has to be put up for review so that the court can make a proper decision, even if just on technicalities. In Germany, for example, you can get speeding tickets thrown out if you can show that the cops have put their radar in a wrong angle towards the street. Drug dealing trials have to leave out evidence if the accused cannot reasonably challenge them [1]. Now compare that to Apple, which in being the ultimate gatekeeper for access to the App Store for iOS and its iPad/Watch equivalents, currently acts as lawmaker, police, DA, judge and court enforcer at once, and its actions are directly affecting the livelihood of anyone wanting to publish an app on the App Stores - anyone from small indie developers to multibillion international conglomerates, and yes, sometimes spammers, scammers, fraudsters and other kinds of criminals.

But to Apple, it usually doesn't even matter how something is accomplished if they don't like the outcome. If they say that \"DOS is not a retro console\" (what does that even mean!?), they won't allow it in any form.

Reviewers are lazy, random and don’t do any homework. You roll a dice and hope you don’t have any issues. Couple that with a bloated Xcode that still hasn’t learned anything from VS Code, long compile times, long processing times, bullshit compliance checkboxes and the time-consuming filling out of information of what your app is all about. Oh, and you can do the same again for Google’s Play Store! No thanks, I’ll stick with PWAs. reply skissane 17 hours agoparentWhat’s needed is for regulators to step in. Create an independent government-run tribunal to which app store review decisions can be appealed by the developers, and legally mandate Apple/Google/etc to obey its rulings. Maybe the EU will do it. If the EU mandated it other jurisdictions would likely follow. Even if they didn’t, you’d likely just be able to incorporate an EU subsidiary, then resubmit the app in the subsidiary’s name, and then lodge the appeal in its name if the submission still gets rejected. reply pjlegato 17 hours agorootparentAllowing government bureaucrats to oversee the app store review process seems like quite possibly the only single thing that could make it even slower, more frustrating, and more arbitrary than it is now. reply skissane 16 hours agorootparent> Allowing government bureaucrats to oversee the app store review process seems like quite possibly the only single thing that could make it even slower, How could it possibly make the review process slower? Such a tribunal would have zero role to play in reviewing the app. It only steps in if the developer wishes to appeal a review rejection. At which point it is reviewing, not the app itself, but rather the reasonableness of the review process which lead to the rejection of that particular app. Also, I wouldn’t suggest government bureaucrats as appointees. My uncle, who is a lawyer, used to sit on one of these government tribunals in Australia (not reviewing app store rejections, reviewing rejections of applications for refugee status). He was not a bureaucrat and nor were any of the other appointees. The government advertised for lawyers in private practice to apply for appointment to the tribunal, and he applied, and he was appointed. His background was in criminal defence not government bureaucracy. And it was a part-time role, so he was still carrying on his private criminal defence practice while he sat on it. It is considered a quasi-judicial role (not technically a judge and not having the same prestige or qualifications or privileges as a judge, but performing some of the same functions) reply tshaddox 17 hours agorootparentprevA government tribunal is probably one of the very few ways to make the experience worse than it already is. reply AuryGlenz 12 hours agoparentprevHeh, try the process for getting a dev kit from Nintendo.

They have some \"do good\" ideas, but they don't represent the interests of any public body of people, nor is it their main interest. If they did, their products would be designed around repairability, for one. And the way they steer general computing into whatever restrictions make them more money (when they could just make general computers like they used to) is definitely not in the interests of the public. All in all, I don't have a problem with Apple. It's a company, it serves its own investors' needs. It functions very well in the capitalistic system — very successful. But the idea that they, all in all, make decisions for the best of the public is contrived and reaching. reply lxgr 16 hours agoparentprevOften enough, Apple's and consumers' selfish interests overlap. That's ok, they're not a nonprofit organization, and this type of win-win is a great example of capitalism working out well!

    "originBody": "Teardowns From 0/10 to 8/10: Microsoft Puts Repair Front and Center Article by: Shahram Mokhtari @shahramm June 22, 2024 Filed under: Teardowns Add Comment Share Microsoft’s team of hardware wizards have spent the last couple of years practicing their Reparo spell and it’s really starting to show. And we’ve noticed, it’s hard not to. It wasn’t that long ago that the Surface team surprised us with a tablet that went from 1/10 in 2013 to a stunning 7/10 in 2022. Needless to say, the new CoPilot+ devices definitely warranted a check in to see how repair was fairing over at Microsoft. We weren’t disappointed. This time around we decided to take a look at both Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices. The first time we tore down a Surface Laptop it received an abysmal 0/10. Some claimed the score was too harsh, our Teardown Engineers thought it wasn’t harsh enough. You’re asking for a 0/10 if we have to cut our way to the battery Surface Laptop 7 The Surface Laptop 7 is an astonishingly repair friendly device, almost the antithesis of the original Surface Laptop. It’s no Framework 13, but it clearly draws inspiration from it. One of the first things you’ll see when removing the magnetically secured bottom plate is a QR code taking you to the service manuals on Microsoft’s website. The manuals were made available the very day the device was released, something we rarely see in any product category. The next things you’ll notice are tiny symbols (Microsoft calls them Wayfinders) indicating which component is being secured by the type and quantity of screws. You could easily disassemble this device without using the manual thanks to these Wayfinders. The battery is secured by eight 5IP Torx screws. A special mention should be made of how most components are accessible without the need to remove additional layers. Need to replace the battery? No problem, it’s just a few screws and a bracket. What if you need to clean the fan? Easy. Just peel back the Surflink cable and undo three screws. This might seem small to some but it shouldn’t be taken for granted. Take the MSI GS65, a laptop that had its fair share of fan failures. You have to remove the entire motherboard and thermal management system just to replace a wonky fan! Surface Pro 11 Thankfully the Surface Pro 11 also contained many of the same repairability improvements. A tablet PC will inherently be more difficult to repair when compared to a laptop, purely because the screen removal process can feel a bit hairy. But if we consider it as its own distinct category of device—comparing it relative to other tablet-like devices and not laptops, which we do in our scoring process—the Surface Pro holds up well for repairability. As with past generation Surface Pro’s, we have access to the M.2 drive via a small magnetic cover underneath the kickstand. Access to anything else requires some disassembly. With the screen off, we find QR codes and Wayfinder markers to aid in the disassembly process. There are more layers of components, which is to be expected when you have half the space to work with. The Surflink cable and the thermal management system need to be removed before we can remove the battery. But all in all, the process isn’t too onerous, especially with manuals to hand. The battery isn’t too difficult to retrieve and is held in place by screws. Not a drop of glue in sight. A note on that Surflink cable, the two screws holding the port in place are non-magnetic. It’s such a small detail but it will be appreciated by anyone who’s ever had to reassemble a magnetic component while dealing with the frustration of having to hold a screw in place with tweezers to prevent it from flying towards the magnet right next to it. Overall, we were extremely pleased with Microsoft’s continued commitment to repairability. The Surface line of devices have performed such a stunning and swift U-turn from unrepairable to very repairable that we can’t help but be impressed, even if they don’t score a perfect 10/10. Speaking of which, after careful consideration and much lively debating, we decided to award both the Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11 an 8/10 for repairability in their respective device categories. Microsoft’s journey from the unrepairable Surface Laptop to the highly repairable devices on our teardown table should drive home the importance of designing for repair. The ability to create a repairable Surface was always there but the impetus to design for repairable was missing. I’ll take that as a sign that Right to Repair advocacy and legislation has begun to bear fruit. You can find chip ID information for the Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11 on their respective guide pages once they’re available.

The right to collective bargaining and the right to strike are not recognised, and the Ministry of Labour has the power to force workers to go back to work. Migrant workers who participate in a strike can have their work permits cancelled and be deported. Consequently, there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis – and other GCC Arabs – getting preference in public sector jobs despite lesser credentials than competitors and lower motivation. In fact, just over eighty per cent of Emirati workers hold government posts, with many of the rest taking part in state-owned enterprises such as Emirates airlines and Dubai Properties. Western states, including the United Kingdom, were also warned by the Emirati Trade Minister, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi to keep politics separate from trade and the economy, as it dilutes the agreements' main objectives. In 2023, Al Zeyoudi indicated that these countries should \"tone down\" the human and workers' rights provisions in the trade deals, in order to gain greater market access and business opportunities.

If a bank wants to do business in the EU, and all the big banks do, then they have to have entities regulated by the relevant EU regulators. Prior to Brexit, it was ok for a bank to be regulated by the PRA or FCA to trade in the EU. Post Brexit, they need to have entities with banking licenses that are subject to EU regulators. And that's what they did: they set up banking entities in Germany, France, Ireland etc. And they moved/hired staff into those countries to support that activity (if they weren't there already). They didn't wholesale move out of London for 2 reasons: The UK is a big market and there is a large pool of skilled people in London that it wouldn't make sense to ignore. > Real Brexiteers were bankers Right. Bankers famously want their ill gotten gains to go to taxation, duty and red tape rather than into their own pockets. They lobby hard for extra regulation, multiple, diverse, enforcement regimes and multiple, diverse taxation regimes. They also want their customers' money to be going to taxation, duty and red tape so that they can't spend it on banking services. Because bankers are famously altruistic like that.

Plenty of OSes have online accounts that the user is encouraged to use/create, but no other OS forces it. Plenty of other OSes have privacy settings tuned to opt-out, but no other OS has those settings sporadically resetting to the less private defaults. No other major OS runs ads in their app launcher. Even in cases where other OSes do commonly misbehave, Microsoft puts them to shame. I think I had one popup about storing things on iCloud when I set up this MacBook. My Pixel phone rarely sends notifications about features I might have missed, but it's possible to shut those off with a single switch.

No one complains about it and instead they praise this as a great feature. Windows does not force you to use the online account to access all the features of your computer, it tries (more and more forcefully) to get you onboard so you get similar backup protection as what you have on your phone but minimally technically savvy users can still create local-only accounts (which is near impossible on the phone OS). reply vladvasiliu 11 hours agorootparentWhat's missing from iOS and Android if you don't use cloud accounts? > Windows does not force you to use the online account to access all the features of your computer With current Windows (11 23h2) you have to know the correct incantation to be able to create a local-only account.

I tried setting up a windows 11 arm VM recently and I couldn't find a working way to use a local account. Yes there are tutorials, but i think everyone at Microsoft is working overtime to invalidate them all. reply jdiff 5 hours agorootparentprevPatently untrue. Both iOS and Android allow you to skip setting up an Apple ID or Google account. The only way you are not allowed to fully use your device is the app stores which require accounts. It's still a phone, you can still sideload apps on Android, or install them on iOS through some sort of device management schemery. However, on Windows, Microsoft is removing every workaround they can find to create a local-only account. It used to be a skip button. Then it used to be unplugging the network cord. For a while it was a magic email address. I believe that trick no longer works, although it did for me the last time I set up a new Windows install. But now, as far as I know, there is no way to create a local account during setup, you have to create an account, then convert it to a local account later. And that still leaves dark pattern upgrades, OS-level third party ads, privacy nightmares, and unmatched first party ads. MSFT is not the good guy in the ecosystem. Never has been.

    "originBody": "Microsoft/ Tech/ Regulation Microsoft charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling Teams Microsoft charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling Teams / The European Commission is concerned Microsoft is giving Teams an unfair advantage over competitors. By Tom Warren, a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years. Jun 25, 2024, 10:37 AM UTC Share this story Image: The Verge EU regulators have charged Microsoft with illegally bundling its Teams chat app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions. It’s the first time Microsoft has been charged with antitrust violations in the EU for 15 years, following two big cases related to Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer bundling. “The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,” says the European Commission in a statement today. Microsoft has now been handed a statement of objections, a list of the EU’s concerns over its Teams bundling. The software giant unbundled Teams from Office in Europe last year in an attempt to address regulator concerns, and then spun off Teams from Office 365 as its own separate app globally. The unbundling hasn’t been enough to prevent charges, though. “We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,” says Margrethe Vestager, the head of competition policy in Europe. “If confirmed, Microsoft’s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules. Microsoft now has the opportunity to reply to our concerns.” Microsoft says it is working with the EU to find solutions. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission’s remaining concerns,” says Microsoft president Brad Smith in a statement to the Financial Times. EU lawmakers first opened a Microsoft antitrust investigation into Teams bundling last year, following an anti-competitive complaint filed by Slack in July 2020. Slack’s original complaint alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.” If Microsoft is found guilty of antitrust violations, the firm could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the company’s annual worldwide turnover. The European Commission could also impose remedies to force Microsoft to change its software products, much like it has in the past. In 2004 the European Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without Media Player bundled, which resulted in a Windows XP N version available only in EU markets. In 2009 Microsoft was also forced to implement a browser ballot box in its Windows operating system to ensure users were presented with a choice of web browsers, after years of Microsoft bunding Internet Explorer with Windows.

    "originBody": "Home Digital News Jun 24, 2024 2:02pm PT MTV News Website Goes Dark, Archives Pulled Offline Paramount Global also has removed content from CMT’s site By Todd Spangler Plus Icon MTV More than two decades’ worth of content published on MTVNews.com is no longer available after MTV appears to have fully pulled down the site and its related content. Content on its sister site, CMT.com, seems to have met a similiar fate. In 2023, MTV News was shuttered amid the financial woes of parent company Paramount Global. As of Monday, trying to access MTV News articles on mtvnews.com or mtv.com/news resulted in visitors being redirected to the main MTV website. The now-unavailable content includes decades of music journalism comprising thousands of articles and interviews with countless major artists, dating back to the site’s launch in 1996. Perhaps the most significant loss is MTV News’ vast hip-hop-related archives, particularly its weekly “Mixtape Monday” column, which ran for nearly a decade in the 2000s and 2010s and featured interviews, reviews and more with many artists, producers and others early in their careers. Related Stories VIP+ Car Buyers Want More Screens as In-Vehicle Entertainment Rises Tom Hanks and Robin Wright Are De-Aged by Decades in 'Here' First Look Photos; Robert Zemeckis Reveals the Camera Never Moves in 104-Minute Film Former MTV News staffers posted on social media about the website shutdown and the scrubbing of the archives. “So, mtvnews.com no longer exists. Eight years of my life are gone without a trace,” Patrick Hosken, former music editor for MTV News, wrote on X. “All because it didn’t fit some executives’ bottom lines. Infuriating is too small a word.” Popular on Variety “sickening (derogatory) to see the entire @mtvnews archive wiped from the internet,” Crystal Bell, culture editor at Mashable and one-time entertainment director of MTV News, posted on X. “decades of music history gone…including some very early k-pop stories.” “This is disgraceful. They’ve completely wiped the MTV News archive,” longtime Rolling Stone senior writer Brian Hiatt commented. “Decades of pop culture history research material gone, and why?” Last week, Paramount Global’s CMT website similarly pulled its repository of country-music journalism dating back several decades. Reps for MTV did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Some observers noted that MTV News articles may be available through internet archiving services like the Wayback Machine, but according to Hiatt older MTV News articles do not show up via Wayback Machine. In May 2023, Paramount Global shut down MTV News — which had already been severely downsized by layoffs in recent years — coming amid a 25% reduction in workforce across the Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks groups in the U.S. The group is headed by president-CEO Chris McCarthy, who in late April was named one of the three co-CEOs running Paramount Global’s “Office of the CEO.” MTV News began in the late ’80s with “The Week in Rock,” a show hosted by Kurt Loder, who was the first MTV News correspondent.

In the past, you could just buy newspapers or keep copies of your works after they were published. You can still do that now, but it's not as important until it goes down. It would be better to negotiate into contracts something like archival rights to writing, or at least a permanent credit/record. Journalism is unique in that it's almost always public in some form. It should be a reasonable expectation that it stays in its original medium, or is accessible in archives if that medium vanishes. Major newspapers often offer reprints or back issues. NYT offers the \"Times Machine\" [0] with basically everything they've ever run digitally. This should be the standard, not the exception. [0]: https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 7 hours agoparent\"Major newspaper often offer reprints or back issues.\" Perhaps younger readers have never experienced looking at microfiche of old newspapers in a library. Analog machines, not computers, but, if memory serves me correctly, the archives were far more complete than the so-called \"tech\" company-mediated, advertising-based nonsense what we have today on the www. And the analog fidelity was great. Google ultimately failed to \"organise the world's information\" to the extent that it previously was organised by public libraries. Instead they turned finding public information into a game designed to support a massive programmatic advertising racket. The www has more volume perhaps than pre-internet libraries but 1. an enormous amount of it is garbage and 2. it is not organised for systematic browsing (leading to discovery) nor serious, methodical research. It is optimised for \"clicks\" and \"views\", selling ad services, not learning. There is no way to \"browse the stacks\" to see how this information is organised. It's all \"secret\". Imagine a public library that had to hide its operations as a \"trade secret\". Imagine that it tried to intermedite which stacks a patron will browse, for commercial purposes. The point is that public libraries had extensive collections of newpapers and periodicals. The public could do serious research. But the www is dominated by advertisers and most of the information published is influenced by commercial motives. And it's all intermediated by a gatekeeper that sells ad services: Google. If I want to use the internet (cf. www) for library research I still somtimes search library catalogs via z39.50 if the library's website is cludgy. reply bombcar 2 hours agorootparentThose microfiche archives were amazing, and you can still today find things in them that do not exist anywhere else in the world. I'm not even talking articles that had errors when digitized or were edited/removed years later, but things like advertisements and all the other stuff that was in a newspaper that \"wasn't the news\". reply sirspacey 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s wild to think in the information era we may actually have an information black hole of this time in 50 years. Man, I miss the original Google mission. reply toomuchtodo 3 hours agorootparentIt's simply a call to support the Internet Archive more robustly, and ensure data stored is durable globally. Who would you trust more? Big Tech and Silicon Valley? Or a non profit with a quirky benevolent dictator whose mission is universal access to all knowledge? reply phone8675309 2 hours agorootparentThe Internet Archive needs all the support we can give so that when hack writers who have Reddit personality disorder blame them for their books not selling during the pandemic sue that the Internet Archive legal team can vaporize said hack from orbit. reply paulryanrogers 6 hours agorootparentprevVolume of data published historically is pretty small compared to today, especially with the web. reply tetris11 4 hours agorootparentthey mentioned that in their comment reply paulryanrogers 4 hours agorootparentLooks like it has expanded significantly from what I recall replying to reply ajb 10 hours agoparentprevThe UK has something like this: it's called \"legal deposit\". Publishers of books and periodicals are required to send copies to the enumerated deposit libraries (one of which is in Ireland despite no longer being part of the UK). Laws were passed to update this to the digital age, allowing the deposit libraries to archive UK websites. Unfortunately they don't right now archive video. It's also a bit limited given that web publishing is not national, so much UK content is published on US run websites. See https://www.bl.uk/legal-deposit-web-archiving reply soco 10 hours agoparentprevAlso MTV News was archived, until today that is. How long until the new CEO of NYT will decide the costs of archiving are not bringing enough shareholder value? From that moment on there won't be a source for reprints either. Am I too negative? reply dehrmann 3 hours agorootparentIt's hard to claim to be a \"paper of record\" if you don't have those records. reply eclecticfrank 6 hours agorootparentprevI was under the impression that (public or state) libraries keep their own archives of many publications to prepare for this case. reply karaterobot 3 hours agorootparentIf the NYT archives only exist at the whim of the CEO, library archives only exist at the whim of local governments. reply codewench 39 minutes agorootparentThe logical decision then is to entrust the preservation to once of the few organizations capable of surviving thousands of years, and forming a religion based on the preservation of works. reply piva00 11 minutes agorootparentprevBy that logic the only archive you can trust is the one you build yourself. Not really feasible. reply dredmorbius 10 hours agoparentprevGawker and numerous shuttered local newspapers (the former Santa Barbara News Press comes to mind: ) have also seen this occur. The challenge for former reporters and staffers who lose any ready access to their portfolio is profound. reply portaouflop 11 hours agoparentprev> You can still do that now, but it's not as important I think you hit the nail here. Most contemporary journalism is just not worth archiving. There is a small percentage that definitely is worth archiving, but the bulk of it is produced for the moment. reply bayindirh 11 hours agorootparent> Most contemporary journalism is just not worth archiving. I don't agree. There are many interesting tidbits which go unnoticed as bog-standard / disposable news until the dots connect in the future, and one wants to construct the history backwards from that tipping point. When these \"contemporary articles\" go missing, many important details of the history is lost. reply ghaff 7 hours agorootparentThe challenge is that it's hard to know. One of the people who recovered a lot of old Usenet archives once remarked that the reality was that no one cares about the details of some long ago SunOS bug whereas a lot of the cultural discussions about government policies etc. provide a window into the time. reply sirspacey 3 hours agorootparentprevI’d challenge you to find one article where this is the case. Almost all “journalism” today is opinion notifications without substance, source, or first hand accounts. I suppose that’s its own kind of historical artifact, but not the kind I’ve seen be meaningful in my study of history. reply notaustinpowers 2 hours agorootparentWho knows, maybe in the future one of those opinion pieces may be the first digital record about a specific topic found by some future civilization. In the same way that the Complaint Tablet to Ea-Nāṣir doesn't provide much historical value, but is interesting in being the oldest written customer complaint. History isn't just about the big things. The history of the mundane is also important in understanding a culture. reply pavlov 11 hours agorootparentprevStorage is also massively cheaper than in the past. It's worth archiving everything that was published on the Internet because you never know what it might reveal in a future context. Maybe the comment thread on a trivial clickbait article contains a post by a future dictator, and it will be a crucial piece of her biography fifty years from now. reply fellerts 11 hours agorootparentprevWho are we to decide? Many television tapes were wiped or lost last century because people didn't think them important, including a big chunk of early Doctor Who and a lot of the Apollo moon landing coverage. reply bayindirh 11 hours agorootparent> a lot of the Apollo moon landing coverage. Even NASA (accidentally?) recycled the master tapes containing the moon landing AFAIK, and some of them are ultimately recovered. Shortsightedness, I may say. reply largelady97 7 hours agorootparentnext [2 more] [flagged] lores 7 hours agorootparentWhat are you doing posting this on Hacker News? Don't you know it's majority-owned by Jon Danilovsky, the son of the moon landing movie producer? Oh god they have your IP now, you only have hours. reply Dylan16807 9 hours agorootparentprevThe text of every article is easily worth archiving. If we take average article size to be 500-800 words, then 2KB each is plenty. You want to hang on to 10 billion articles? That will cost you 1 (ONE) hard drive. Remember to make backups. If we allocate 200KB per article for pretty strongly compressed images, then it's still 100 million on a single hard drive. Why not archive the whole lot and let God or future historians sort it out? You only need to start getting picky when video is involved, but on the other hand when the alternative is total obliteration you can crush video down to 1MB per minute and have a tolerable VHS-like experience. And even 8MB Shrek gets the point across. reply robertlagrant 4 hours agorootparent> when the alternative is total obliteration you can crush video down to 1MB per minute and have a tolerable VHS-like experience That's still pushing a terabyte a day[0] on YouTube alone. What about TikTok as well? [0] https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-up... reply Dylan16807 2 hours agorootparentI think you undershot that by a factor of 60. But when I said \"get picky\" I meant things like not archiving all of youtube. And for articles specifically, archiving every video article is a lot smaller. https://routenote.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pex-yo... And going by this, restricting to a reasonable view count will cut the space you need by a factor of 10 to 25. If we round that to a petabyte per year, it's not in the range of a typical personal archive, but it's a reasonable thing to picture several big libraries doing. (Though a single person could handle that much if they really wanted to, spending $10 a day on data tapes.) reply estebank 2 hours agorootparentprevSo, a single laptop hard drive a day? 50 tape drives a year? For the biggest repository of video there is? That's literally peanuts. There's some logistics in handling backup tapes, but that's a well understood process. reply bityard 2 hours agorootparentprev> Most contemporary journalism is just not worth archiving. It is impossible to know presently, how valuable something will be to someone in the future. I don't know if any historians have this as their motto, but I like to think they do. reply dspillett 10 hours agorootparentprev> but the bulk of it is produced for the moment. But to a historian it is all a series of moments. To understand how/why one happened, it is useful to know the ones that came before, and things created for the moment might better describe it than those with a wider purview. Of course you don't need it all, but deciding what to keep is a complex (and bias ridden, accidental or otherwise) problem in its own right. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentprevMost contemporary journalism isn't even worth reading, let alone archiving. It's published at virtually no cost compared to what newspapers and magazines used to cost. And with LLMs it's going to get even cheaper as you no longer need people to write the stories. We are spiraling into an era where we will be drowned in content that is all worth next to nothing. reply s_dev 10 hours agorootparentprev>Most contemporary journalism is just not worth archiving Considering how much historians love ancient rubbish bins, one mans junk is another mans treasure. Even the junk produced during and before the Trump/Brexit 2016 election/referendum would be massively valuable to a future historian in explaining how those things happened. reply dalore 9 hours agorootparentprevIn a way it was archived, into the minds and training data of AI models. reply basch 12 hours agoparentprevthere is perma.cc which gets around the archive.today and waybackmachine gray area by only allowing link archival through affiliate libraries. It's as close as you get to the government archiving journalism/culture, besides the loc. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perma.cc https://perma.cc/ reply sambazi 9 hours agorootparentinteresting. the sing-up friction and overall restrictiveness clearly demonstrate why the grey area is necessary reply ghaff 7 hours agoparentprev>You can still do that now, but it's not as important until it goes down. Yes. It's very easy to get into the mode of \"I can always download it\"--until you can't. Or at least it's very hard to find. I've been pretty good over time. I probably have copies of 75%+ (probably more for stuff I actually care about). But I've definitely written for sites that don't exist any longer, at least a couple of which were behind paywalls. reply Dalewyn 12 hours agoparentprevIf you're your own rightsholder, obviously you can do whatever you want. The NYT archive is one such example. In the more common case where you are not, though, the law already provides exceptions to copyright for archiving and redistributing materials that are no longer available. This generally only applies to content that isn't audio/video/graphical, but a wider exception is provided specifically for \"news\" (journalism). If you want to negotiate a contract making such archival exceptions explicit within the contract itself, that's probably not a bad idea. Even if not though, the law provides for archival protections already. Further reading: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108 reply subsubzero 2 hours agoprevThis sets a scary precedent regarding reporting and the capture of history in general. If all of a few decades worth of music history disappears due to a companies financial health(no company is around forever). We basically lose that data forever and history is wiped out. With most news data now being online this could happen to any news going forward and a great loss to society. Internet Archive does a good job(they are a very small outfit) but there should be a organization (non-profit that all news/media sites could pay into) that would archive everything ever created online so as to have this content available for future generations. reply superidiot1932 2 hours agoparentBlockchain solves this, it is possible to fund immutable data archival and ordering using a blockchain cryptocurrency. reply janalsncm 1 hour agorootparentUnless you’re referring to storing all of this information on-chain (and not a reference to it), no it does not. reply superidiot1932 53 minutes agorootparentYes that is the idea, there already are successful blockchains such as arweave that functions like this. reply AnimalMuppet 54 minutes agorootparentprevIt's possible to fund an immutable data archive using a normal trust.

Why not? I'm not disparaging; I'm just asking what the reason is. What causes something to be in the Internet Archive in the first place? reply onion2k 11 hours agoprevThis really only tells us that there's nothing special about digital archives. They can come and go just like physical archives. If you want something to be available for longer than it's commercial lifespan you need to put it in a library or an archive that's designed and funded with the specific goal of preserving things. reply LVB 29 minutes agoparentWhen I’m in a library, or perhaps a Goodwill store, and see some woefully out-of-date volume (that 1991 copy of “Let’s Go: Chicago”), I think about how it survives because it takes work to remove it. Multiply this by the number of physical copies that can be scattered about, and it just seems more intrinsically stable than a purely digital work. Sure, we could be making infinite digital copies, but it seems like so far we’re cool with 2 (the original, and internet archive) reply eclecticfrank 6 hours agoparentprevAgreed, for MTV the (archival) content might have just served to generate search hits, eyeballs and ad-serving space. A library has a different set of goals with the same content. reply neilv 17 hours agoprevI wonder whether that data has more value to the owner if it's not online -- make AI companies pay for it if they want it. And maybe take legal action against those who've already used it, for training and knowledge bases, without licensing it. That'd be different than a company simply not wanting to incur the small costs of keeping it online. (Still sounds crappy, but it's not \"for nothing\".) reply yamazakiwi 2 hours agoparentThis was my reaction; additionally, they believe few people will notice or complain. reply jccalhoun 16 hours agoprevMTV did a ton of documenting mainstream music and youth culture over the decades. It is a shame it is largely inaccessible. reply fidotron 7 hours agoparentI've known people working on archiving at big old media organizations, and one thing that is underestimated is the extent to which now inconvenient things are painted out of the archives. For example, there was a large classic cartoon archive which had a whole team of retouchers painting out all the smoking. reply toyg 3 hours agorootparentStalin's administration would be so proud! reply ethagnawl 13 hours agoparentprevI haven't watched it yet but, apparently, the documentary about Lollapalooza that was just released was largely based on content from their archive. I don't know the details but MTV was somehow involved in the production. So, that's all to say that their archives are undoubtedly a treasure trove of historically, culturally significant media. It's a shame only the select few get access to such a resource. reply portaouflop 11 hours agorootparentThe same is true for so many archives and collections. I think one of the worst crimes of modernity is to lock away knowledge and art for the sake of „protecting and sustaining it“ - copyright is broken and needs reform, the current system does not serve it’s intended purposes and we need to come up with something better. reply sirspacey 3 hours agorootparentI’d love to see copyright as stewardship. If you preserve it, provide access and have the ownership rights, you keep it. If you don’t, you lose it. reply dghughes 2 hours agoparentprevThat's like in Canada we had Much Music which began after MTV but there was The New Music in 1979 three years before MTV existed. JD Roberts (before he became evil) and Jeanne Becker (went on to fashion journalism fame). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_NewMusic reply rchaud 4 hours agoprevI encourage everybody to check out your local magazine rack. Many music publications (Rolling Stone, Uncut, others) are putting out \"book-a-zines\" or \"Ultimate Guide to Band X\" style compilations containing original photos, interviews and reviews from the magazines ' archives. In a world where anything online is link-rotting or pay walled, or copyrighted by Getty images, these are a way to build your own collection of non-404'ing information. I have a few of these: Nirvana, Joy Division, Pink Floyd, Uncut Guide to Shoegaze. For $15 or so each, it's not a bad deal, about the cost of a CD. Full-size colour pictures look way better than the low res images found online too. reply bobbob1921 3 hours agoprevCan someone explain why wayback machine and the other archive services aren’t filling in this gap/working in this case? (I.e., the article seems to say all archives are gone , I understand why mtvnews.com is now in-accessible, but why would the wayback machines archives be gone also ,just because the parent/ source website was shut down?) tks reply entrepy123 3 hours agoparent> why would the wayback machines archives be gone also I don't know for sure, but, as a hypothetical example, in this case, MTV could have requested that IA take down the archives from that time period. (That is, if MTV can prove they owned the domain during the archive period [probably pretty easy]), and if they still hold the copyright to that work [probably], then they could essentially issue a DMCA takedown request [by email], with which IA would most likely comply [there are some HN and IA forum posts about this I think].) > just because the parent/ source website was shut down The \"just because\" part is not a well-founded assumption AFAICT. For all we know, there could have been a request like above. > why wayback machine and the other archive services aren’t filling in this gap/working in this case? I see no evidence that IA isn't working in this case, if working is defined as including having a process for handling valid takedown requests that must be acted on according to the rules they follow. I hope that helps. Again I don't know if this is what happened, it's all hypothetical. reply archagon 8 minutes agorootparentSounds like we need a decentralized equivalent of the IA. reply toyg 3 hours agoparentprev> but according to Hiatt older MTV News articles do not show up via Wayback Machine. So not all, only \"older\" articles are not available. Wayback Machine only works after someone submits the site for archival; the old site might have used something that made it hard to archive content; and I expect MTV pre-dates the Internet Archive.

Also, ending my subscription shouldn't end my access, just access to new content (i.e., content I did not pay for). And maybe the older content gets ads as a supplemental.

I don’t know how any good archivist can think they will know what will be important in the future. I did a search for MTV and only got 3 results, and only 1 is actually from MTV. For the cultural significance MTV had, I find this hard to believe. https://www.loc.gov/web-archives/?q=MTV I can’t figure out how to actually view the archived page, which is also an issue. What good is an archive if it can’t be accessed. Either way, it seems like if the government was going to put more money behind internet archiving, they’d fund their own service to make it better. reply t_mann 17 hours agoparentprevI actually disagree. Archiving is a complex issue that touches on the interests not only of the general public but also those who produced or are covered in the materials to be archived, and the ways in which it might affect their interests might not even have been clear at the time of publication (think about LLM training as just one example), or their interests might not have been heard at the time. I think a public institution would be better placed than a private organization to deal with weighing the - evolving - legitimate interests of all parties concerned by the decisions of whether and how to archive something. reply nox101 14 hours agorootparentIn today's political climate I can imagine one side or the other demanding that all material that espouses position X must be expunged from the archive as \"wrong think\" reply wizardforhire 16 hours agorootparentprevCame to initially disagree but realized I was making the same point. Archiving is in the matter of public interest which defaults to government. Resolving the conflict, the internet archive should be absorbed into the library congress. It would be a win-win, the internet archive would have the backing it needs both financially and legally and the library of congress will be able to modernize and expand it’s already daunting mandate allowing them to gain further public awareness and legitimacy. reply toomuchtodo 16 hours agorootparentThe Internet Archive works with the federal government currently, and while they receive benefits and incentives as a bonafide library, it is better (imho) they are distinct from the government to remain segregated from potential political influence and interference. This doesn’t prevent a federal agency tasked with preservation from kicking off archiving operations and operating a replicated copy of the Internet Archive (or a subset of the corpus). In the current operating environment, it is important to optimize for optionality. (No affiliation with the Internet Archive, just a concerned citizen) reply basch 12 hours agoparentprevI mentioned above in the thread, perma.cc is a service, that collects government, institution, and library money and archives on their behalf.

Off the top of my head, they've preserved flash games and animations and written an interpreter to get them working in modern browsers; they've scanned books and made them borrowable from the browser, which I've personally used for archival research. I'm guessing what you're referring to is their lawsuit with the publishing industry, where they attempted to lend digital copies of books without backing them with hard copies on a shelf. That was probably ill advised, and I suppose you could view it as political activism, but it's pretty obviously in furtherance of their mission as archivists - preserving content means little if it can't be accessed.

The OPs link does not define what an archive is or isn't, it defines constraints on an archive or library such that it doesn't infringe on copyright according to US law. To conclude that the IA is not operating an archive because they might be infringing on some copyrights according to US law is fallacious thinking. reply Dalewyn 13 hours agorootparentYou have it backwards. It is not an infringement of copyright if an archive or library reproduces and redistributes according to the exceptions set forth. The Internet Archive quite clearly does not abide by those exceptions, and as such they are infringing copyright and not an archive protected by these laws. If the Internet Archive (or anyone and anything for that matter) wants to spend my tax dollars, they can start by first abiding by the laws and regulations of the legal jurisdiction they reside in, in this case the USA's. reply hipadev23 16 hours agorootparentprevCiting a law on what copyright permissions are granted to libraries and archives does not define what an archive is nor what archiving entails. reply lightedman 17 hours agorootparentprev\"An archive may not be available directly to the public\" Well, then, most files that call themselves archives can't be legal under that definition.

That is one of the more, if not most, flagrant demonstrations of the Internet Archive not understanding what an archive is. There's more where that came from, including stuff like their one:many digital book lending program. The law stipulates what an archive/library is and how they are protected from certain copyright prosecutions. The Internet Archive does not abide them, and thus I would absolutely not want my tax dollars sent their way. If they want to engage in flagrant piracy and political activism, they can do so on their own dime.

Copyright utterly needs strengthening, not weakening. reply rany_ 15 hours agorootparentReally? It takes a ridiculously long time for anything to enter the public domain.

    "originBody": "June 18, 2024 Editors' notes This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread Researchers invent 100% biodegradable 'barley plastic' by University of Copenhagen Experiments on the degradation of different plastic materials. Top left is a common LDPE plastic film. Top center and right are the researchers' amylose-based bioplastic and a plastic made from corn starch, respectively. At the bottom are three different bags made from conventional bioplastics. A) shows the start of the experiment. B) shows the degradation after 8 days, C) the degradation after 11 days, D) 21 days E 41 days and F) shows the degradation after 54 days. Credit: Andreas Blennow A biofriendly new material made from barley starch blended with fiber from sugarbeet waste—a strong material that turns into compost should it end up in nature—has been created at the University of Copenhagen. In the long term, the researchers hope that their invention can help put the brakes on plastic pollution while reducing the climate footprint of plastic production. Enormous islands of plastic float in our oceans and microscopic particles of it are in our bodies. The durability, malleability and low cost of plastics has made them ubiquitous, from packaging to clothing to aircraft parts. But plastics have a downside. Plastics contaminate nature, are tough to recycle and their production emits more CO2 than all air traffic combined. Now, researchers at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences have invented a new material made from modified starch that can completely decompose in nature—and do so within only two months. The material is made using natural plant material from crops and could be used for food packaging, among many other things. \"We have an enormous problem with our plastic waste that recycling seems incapable of solving. Therefore, we've developed a new type of bioplastic that is stronger and can better withstand water than current bioplastics. At the same time, our material is 100% biodegradable and can be converted into compost by microorganisms if it ends up somewhere other than a bin,\" says Professor Andreas Blennow of the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences. Only about 9% of plastic is recycled globally, with the rest being either incinerated or winding up in nature or dumped into enormous plastic landfills. Bioplastics already exist, but the name is misleading says Blennow. While today's bioplastics are made of bio-derived materials, only a limited part of them is actually degradable, and only under special conditions in industrial composting plants. \"I don't find the name suitable because the most common types of bioplastics don't break down that easily if tossed into nature. The process can take many years and some of it continues to pollute as microplastic. Specialized facilities are needed to break down bioplastics. And even then, a very limited part of them can be recycled, with the rest ending up as waste,\" says the researcher. Starch from barley and sugar industry waste The new material is a so-called biocomposite and composed of several different substances that decompose naturally. Its main ingredients, amylose and cellulose, are common across the plant kingdom. Amylose is extracted from many crops including corn, potatoes, wheat and barley. Together with researchers from Aarhus University, the research team founded a spinoff company in which they developed a barley variety that produces pure amylose in its kernels. This new variety is important because pure amylose is far less likely to turn into a paste when it interacts with water compared to regular starch. Cellulose is a carbohydrate found in all plants and we know it from cotton and linen fibers, as well as from wood and paper products. The cellulose used by the researchers is a so-called nanocellulose made from local sugar industry waste. And these nanocellulose fibers, which are one thousand times smaller than the fibers of linen and cotton, are what contribute to the material's mechanical strength. \"Amylose and cellulose form long, strong molecular chains. Combining them has allowed us to create a durable, flexible material that has the potential to be used for shopping bags and the packaging of goods that we now wrap in plastic,\" says Blennow. The new biomaterial is produced by either dissolving the raw materials in water and mixing them together or by heating them under pressure. By doing so, small \"pellets\" or chips are created that can then be processed and compressed into a desired form. Thus far, the researchers have only produced prototypes in the laboratory. But according to Blennow, getting production started in Denmark and many other places in the world would be relatively easy. \"The entire production chain of amylose-rich starch already exists. Indeed, millions of tons of pure potato and corn starch are produced every year and used by the food industry and elsewhere. Therefore, easy access to the majority of our ingredients is guaranteed for the large-scale production of this material,\" he says. Could reduce plastic problem Blennow and his fellow researchers are now processing a patent application that, once it has been approved, could pave the way for production of the new biocomposite material. Because, despite the huge sums of money being devoted to sorting and recycling our plastic, the researcher does not believe that it will really be a success. Doing so should be seen as a transitional technology until we bid fossil-based plastics a final farewell. \"Recycling plastic efficiently is anything but straightforward. Different things in plastics must be separated from each other and there are major differences between plastic types, meaning that the process must be done in a safe way so that no contaminants end up in the recycled plastic. \"At the same time, countries and consumers must sort their plastic. This is a massive task that I don't see us succeeding at. Instead, we should rethink things in terms of utilizing new materials that perform like plastic, but don't pollute the planet,\" says Blennow. The researcher is already collaborating with two Danish packaging companies to develop prototypes for food packaging, among other things. He envisions many other uses for the material as well, such as for the interior trims of cars by the automotive industry. Though it is difficult to say when this biofriendly barley-based plastic will reach the shelves, the researcher predicts that the new material may become a reality in the foreseeable future. \"It's quite close to the point where we can really start producing prototypes in collaboration with our research team and companies. I think it's realistic that different prototypes in soft and hard packaging, such as trays, bottles and bags, will be developed within one to five years,\" concludes Blennow.

I am not discounting the benefits plastics have brought to medicine such as hygiene, but I am concerned its environmental impact.

But I am curious what sort of test a biodegradable/sustainable plastic would need to stand for it to replace traditional plastics. reply rmason 9 hours agoprevWhen news is announced like this the focus is always on biodegradable. They already make biodegradable plastic from corn. But it has two problems: it is more expensive and has a rough finish which isn't as desirable as a smooth shiny surface. Here in Michigan we have been trying to find a use for sugar beet waste for over forty years. Nothing has ever really caught on. Very little barley is grown however in the state but I guess there could be if this proves to be competitive with regular plastic. In fact Northern Michigan which has too short a growing season for corn would be an ideal candidate. No one ever talks about paper bags. Growing up that's all we ever used and it was easily biodegradable. But stores went with the cheaper solution. reply tw04 34 minutes agoparent> But stores went with the cheaper solution. Right, because a business will almost always take the cheapest option possible unless there is direct customer pushback. It turns out consumers are really bad about thinking about long term (think decades) consequences that don’t immediately provide negative feedback. Which is why we have government, to protect society from risks that may happen over a longer period of time or fall out of their direct control. Think: the EPA. reply dougdimmadome 8 hours agoparentprevIn Ireland a few years ago a plastic bag levy was introduced. If you want a plastic bag at the checkout, you have to pay 5c for each one. Now everyone has reusable shopping bags they bring to the stores. The bags are much more rugged than single use plastic bags or paper, and reuse is better than recycling. However, I think shopping bags are probably not the intended market for this stuff, and the need is more to replace the plastic wrapping that covers food. There have been efforts here and in the UK to reduce the amount of packaging in the first place but there will continue to be places where we still need it for a while reply happyopossum 1 hour agorootparentSimilar thing in California happened about 10 years ago - 10 cents per bag. Unfortunately, it backfired - because the 10 cent bags are thicker (they can't be designed for \"single use\", so they have to be thick enough to be \"reusable\"), the amount of plastic bag waste in landfills has actually risen dramatically in that time.

How many bags did they replace when they reach their end of life? Where do they go at the end of life? How much do they cost? The previous plastic bags may have been reused (ie for small garbage bags). Are consumers now just purchasing equivalent plastic bags for that purpose?

I don't understand why this isn't acknowledged more. Banning plastic bags in the US does absolutely nothing for the plastic bags clogging waterways in Asia. Sometimes people think plastic recycling in the US is shipped to Asia where it ends up in waterways but that's not a thing either. It might get buried in a landfill there rather than recycled, but compressed pallets of plastic recycling aren't getting dumped into rivers. That's not a thing. The bags aren't flying away in the wind or something either.

They biodegrade, they're made from waste and recycled wood and paper pulp, and they can be produced locally. The only thing that makes them not ideal is the handles tear off. Frequently the store staff have to double-bag everything with paper because the bags tear so easily. But when double-bagged I can get 5 or 10 uses out of them, which suggests that the bag just needs to be thicker to be highly reusable. reply ssl-3 2 minutes agorootparentPaper bags are available in a range of thicknesses, just as approximately every other paper product is. reply kjkjadksj 2 hours agorootparentprevBankers boxes would probably last for years of use.

Your comment is a textbook argument of perfect being the enemy of good. Sure, some bags are thrown out. Sure, people use more than one. Sure, people can buy them if they feel they need them. That's perfectly fine, as that's completely besides the point. What you're failing to mention is that thanks to this push to adopt reusable bags the use of single-use plastic bags plummeted. You no longer see over a dozen single-use bags being thrown out at each and every single shopping trip. These bags aren't recyclable and disintegrate very easily, making it extremely hard to pull them out of the environment once they get there. You're also somehow leaving out is the fact that some major supermarkets chains are making available reusable shopping bags made of natural fiber. It's not a given that you're replacing large volumes of single-use plastic with small volumes of reusable plastic, as you're also seeing small volumes of natural fabric being used. You're also leaving out the fact that this push is taking single-use plastic out of the market but nothing forces customers to adopt the store's own offerings. Anyone is able to buy whatever type of shopping bag suits their fancy. So no, you're not seeing plastic being replaced with plastic. You're seeing drastic reductions in plastic use by eliminating perverse incentives to consume single-use plastic containers, and the adoption of substitute goods that have a far preferable environmental footprint. reply rpdillon 1 hour agorootparentI think your response is overly optimistic; what you're saying is _possible_, but actual deployment of the policy leaves quite a bit to be desired.

For example, the Aldi stores I shop at in the US have a couple of cages with empty boxes in them. The boxes on the shelves get emptied and then the employees round them up and drop them in accessible cages/crates. This allows a person to choose to either buy a paper bag, buy a reusable bag, or make due with a couple of free boxes that were going to be disposed of anyways. reply michael_vo 1 hour agorootparentcostco has been doing this since the beginning! reply vlachen 1 hour agorootparentNot something I have in my area, so I have no experience with Costco. reply Workaccount2 4 hours agorootparentprevThe killer is grocery delivery services. They got wrapped up in the legislation, so they must deliver groceries in reusable bags. It's totally impractical to come an collect the bags again (collect, clean, sort), so instead our small office, for instance, goes through about a dozen of them a month. reply namibj 14 minutes agorootparentLook at VDA's KLT system for example to see something that works readily for the reusable crate task. Just hand over your empty crate into the empty hands/van-shelf-space of the delivery driver after taking the crate with your fresh goods out of their hands. Bonus: the KLT system easily offers enough assistance to automated/mechanized handling that the box delivery task doesn't require humans. Could probably easily have a portal crane style 4-wheel robot to drive the new box from the van to your door, drop it, and bring back an empty box you put out for it. Well, something about curbs, but the stair dolly (big wheel made of 3 smaller wheels) style drive can probably cope with most. Originally the KLT boxes were made to elide re-packing and manual box handling in the many-small-supplier-companies car industry of Germany. They differ from the more widely seen euro boxes by having molded features to allow a robot gripper to \"plug\" into any of the 6 sides of the cuboid and get a solid grasp of the box suitable for (re-)stacking them as long as their nominal load rating is adhered to. Also at least one, if space a short and a long side though, have a slot to hold a DIN A-series piece of (tick/heavy) paper describing the box contents, such that the box won't be contaminated with sticky tape residue. When they're eventually broken from old age or abuse, they can be recycled cleanly because they are normed to be a pretty specific plastic and to (for interchange at least) be one of that colors (grey and a dark blue). I have seen a local service, picnic, using a small urban-only electric truck (if not even a tricycle) who's back is just a 120 cm (plus tolerances plus door thing) wide shelf to be used with 40x60 cm euro boxes. If they were KLTs you could just put the box as-is in your pantry instead of doing the \"dump onto kitchen table\" tactic, I guess. reply camtarn 3 hours agorootparentprevOver here in the UK, our grocery delivery service (Sainsburys) just comes to your door with flat crates full of unbagged shopping. You meet them at the door and transfer the shopping into your own bags. It's a lot slower than just grabbing bagged shopping out of the crates, and I have no idea how it works for folks in flats/apartments (do the delivery folks have to walk each crate up four flights of stairs individually?) but it is nice that it doesn't cause as much direct waste. Albeit that it might cause indirect waste due to now needing more vans on the road to service the same number of users, hm. reply jstanley 2 hours agorootparentYou can carry the crate to the kitchen and dump out the contents on your worktop/floor.

I don't think so. This is largely dependant on each grocery delivery service, but of you look at it the worst cases are actually just continuing business as usual,which is hardly a regression. In the meantime, some services managed to completely eliminate the use of plastic bags. As an example, for the past year or so I had a groceries delivery service use their old plastic bags, but they also implemented a charge-back service where they pay you back when/if you return them in the following delivery. This is clearly an improvement. In the meantime I had competing supermarket chains completely switch away from single-use bags to alternatives such as reusable plastic crates and even reusable cardboard crates.

They are great! They are reusable, are breathable so that no moisture builds up but not breathable enough that, lets say bread for example, goes dry in it. And of course completely compostable as they are made of cotton and bees wax. If they get dirty you can just scrub them under warm running water. Of course they are way more expensive than buying a roll of plastic bags, but I bought them one by one and made plastic bags basically obsolete (other than for freezing bread, as that does not fit in my freezer containers) in my house hold over the course of a year or so. And I expect them, based on experience over the last year, to hold for at least another 2 years without needing to reapply the wax layer or buying new ones. reply 4g 6 minutes agorootparentThere are a few problems with beeswax, given the very low supply and high demand the price of real beeswax is an order of magnitude greater than paraffin wax, so there is a very large incentive to at the very least mix in some paraffin. Also much of the beehive foundation sheets are made of adulterated wax. But even if you managed to find some real beeswax, given that bees are collecting pollen from many fields that have been treated with pesticide the harmful substances tend to accumulate in the beeswax and the concentration increases every year if not filtered correctly, and given how hard it is to filter it from fatty substance you might end up with some in the wax. reply TheDudeMan 2 hours agoparentprevIdeally, your government would tax the bad thing.

A lot of plastic products don't need to be durable for very long. If it needs to be durable, there are perfectly good materials other than plastic that you could use that are probably better. In fact, most plastics don't actually do that well over time (some exceptions of course) and aren't that durable. Quite a few types of plastic degrade under UV light for example. Of course not enough to fully degrade but they become brittle, get ugly, etc. If it stayed in one piece and just sat there not changing, plastics would actually be less of an issue. The issue is that they do degrade and gradually turn into micro plastics. Which end up in animal and human tissue causing all sorts of issues. reply solardev 14 hours agoparentprevFood wraps, straws, cup liners, plates, bowls, utensils, anywhere single use plastics are just there to hold something for like 30 min before being discarded. reply jnurmine 11 hours agorootparentStill, why plastic nowadays?

Most just use regular cheap plastic and some still use Styrofoam. I think a bioplastic that actually biodegrades in average municipal landfills at a minimal cost markup vs current plastics, that say 40% of restaurants adopt voluntarily (or by regulation), will be more impactful than the boutique reusables we currently see but only at like one restaurant per thousand. I don't ever see places like Walmart or Costco switching to wooden bowls, for example. But bioplastics that look and feel the same and only cost a few percentage more? Maybe. Especially if encouraged by local regulations, similar to plastic bag bans. reply DFHippie 2 hours agorootparent> Very few restaurants want to pay a premium for the deluxe eco groovy stuff, in my experience (as a customer only, but one who frequents such stores).

Restaurants can be perfectly sincere (and branding isn't incompatible with sincerity), but they have tight margins. It's their customers who really have the choice, and there are very few customers willing to pay extra for the eco stuff. It reminds me of this evergreen Onion article: https://www.theonion.com/report-98-percent-of-u-s-commuters-... reply solardev 1 hour agorootparentI'm not saying restaurants are insincere about it, just that it's a cost of doing business many won't (or can't) absorb. It's usually the more expensive hippie-tastic places with already-high prices (and hopefully higher margins) that can afford them. Culturally, I don't think customers would accept a choice on the matter either, like I've never seen a place offer \"you can have the plastic box for free, or buy the sustainable wooden one for $2\". In lieu of that, I used to bring my own reusable tupperware to the restaurants for takeout, but got a looooooot of strange looks and comments about that. What I'd really love to see is more of a \"borrow a tupperware, bring back a tupperware\" model where they just loan you containers. I'd only ever seen that on college campuses, not in the real world. Anyway, none of that is really the point. There's nothing wrong with fancy sustainable/reusable dishware, but something that's incrementally better and not much more costly than regular plastic is much more likely to see widespread adoption. I think the gradual phase-out of styrofoam to plastics is one such example, and cheap bioplastics of the less-biodegradable kind are more common now (though not everywhere), paperboard boxes with some wax paper/foil lining are popping up, some places are doing away with bottled plastic water in favor of water in milk-like cartons... gradual incrementalism seems to work better than revolutionary approaches in that industry. reply adrianN 10 hours agorootparentprevPlastic is cheap and convenient.

There are these gluten-free burritos in the gluten-free section. The other day, I got one out of my freezer and only after opening the package and seeing the burrito was a bit browner than usual and thinking \"is this spoiled?\", then I thought \"wait, is this not gluten-free?\" and verifyied the package...didn't say gluten-free.

They often do this in the gluten-free bread/etc aisle, too, right next to the gluten-free stuff.

If USA and Europe banned all imports of goods produced in economies with lower regulation than theirs, then China's bad labour and environmental practices will become mostly inconsequential, as their production volume would be mostly inconsequential. Furthermore, if USA and Europe had reasonable domestic regulations, they would not need to buy so many goods from China to begin with. Another way to think about it, the greatest beneficiary of environmental regulation in the west has not been the environment. It has been non-western countries where the regulation does not apply.

And in places like the US, the difference between plant sourced and fossil fuel sourced plastic is that plant based would shift the externality calculation towards net positive externalities, since it would shift the plastic industry towards ideally becoming a net carbon sink and leverage consumerism and america's love of single use plastics and packaging to create a market for carbon capture. reply metaphor 14 hours agoprevWonder how gluten-free Danes feel about this tech. reply radu_floricica 13 hours agoprevI'm incredibly pro-tech as a rule, but my first reaction here was a groan. We'll probably be forced to use plastic replacements that are 100x more expensive and come with a new set of problems. I hate it with a fiery passion when environmentalism is disconnected from numbers. reply feydaykyn 12 hours agoparentWhat about taking the longer view? Most technologies, including plastics, were a lot more expensive than the products they replaced before going mainstream, with society organizing around them and subsidizing many of the costs. For instance, take petrol-powered cars. It took building cemented roads, petrol stations, petrol distribution networks, supertankers, boats, trucks, car companies, refineries, etc. Cities are built for cars, with large roads while space is at a premium and could be used for something else. All that was 100x more expensive than horses and came with a new set of problems. Another topic: plastic \"feels\" cheaper, but it's because some costs are not factored into the price, for instance in environment and health. I am not endorsing the following report, just citing it as an example of this idea: https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?3507866/These-costs-for-plas... reply radu_floricica 4 hours agorootparentAll this counts into the \"I'm usually very pro-tech\". The point I'm contesting here is pure ideological regulation, without numbers behind it. Ban on plastic bags is actually the perfect example. You can calculate the number of times you need to actually use a reusable bag before it breaks even, and it's stratospheric. I'm not googling for a (potentially biased) source, but I'm sure you've seen such numbers. And the downside is twofold. First, there's actually a pretty decent correlation between how expensive something is and how harmful for the environment. If you use a hand-made cloth bag made from cotton that was hand-grown in a garden using only renewable energy, it's expensive because you have a higher number of man-hours spent on it - and those man-hours are actually generating orders of magnitude more negative externalities for the simple fact of keeping those workers alive. The 1 cent plastic bag may be made from oil using energy from burning coal, but it's actually much cleaner because it used only a fraction of the man-hours. Whenever you hear claims that \"it's a lot more expensive but it's green\", the first guess is somebody didn't factor in everything. The second downside is that bans are taking choice away. If you think there are negative externalities, and you have a good enough argument - by all means, tax those plastic bags until you compensate. If there are still objections to people buying the more expensive plastic bags, those objections are most likely ideological, not practical. Which yes, I still continue to hate with a fiery passion. reply samatman 1 hour agorootparent> If you use a hand-made cloth bag made from cotton that was hand-grown in a garden using only renewable energy, it's expensive because you have a higher number of man-hours spent on it - and those man-hours are actually generating orders of magnitude more negative externalities for the simple fact of keeping those workers alive. This style of energy accounting makes no sense to me. Humans are going to use up resources and create pollution, regardless of what their specific source of income happens to be. More artisanal cotton bags means less of something else, in some broad sense, but that says nothing about the environmental accounting of the other side of the margin. The ratio of workers making luxury goods vs. mass producing cheaper substitutes for those goods will have little to no bearing on how many humans happen to exist, birth rates are clearly dominated by other factors. reply nickserv 11 hours agoparentprevYes let's not do anything about a major problem the entire world is facing, lest you be slightly inconvenienced. reply The_Colonel 12 hours agoparentprevI'm all for thinking economically and deciding based on numbers.

    "title": "I built a JavaScript-powered flipdisc display",
    "originLink": "https://flipdisc.io/",
    "originBody": "Flipdiscs (or flip dots) are a display type that utilizes electromagnetic pulses to flip a small disc between two colors. Despite being invented over 80 years ago, the underlying technology is mostly the same today. I chose them because I wanted to design a large interactive wall art for my office, and didn’t like the LED glow of traditional screens. Flip displays are an interesting alternative. They have high readability, a long lifespan, and achieves anywhere between 25-60fps. Also, as a pleasant bonus, they emit a sound like rain hitting a window each time one of the disc flips - I find it very soothing. I’ve always wanted unique ways to visualize code, like this pixel knitting app we designed for electroknit knitting machines or this crafting tool for Atom Editor (RIP). Flipdots seemed like a similar fun challenge. I paired with my partner to help code and design the board. Who doesn’t love quality hacking time with their partner?! I’m not sure how many people will find this useful since flipdisc displays are sort of an obscure technology, but here we go! Contents Build Software Design Next Steps Conclusion Build Panels We used 9 Alfazeta panels in a 3x3 grid or 84x42 discs. Each board has (2) 28x7 panels. You can see the measurments of the toal design in this diagram. The PCB features an older ATMEGA128 microcontroller, a couple hundred MELF diodes (be sure to buy extras, because they can pop off easily!) charlieplexed together, and two DIP switches. One DIP switch sets the address, and the other sets the baud rate. Find more information about the AlfaZeta boards, here is the manual. It’s relatively difficult to source flipdisc boards or components, so your options are limited. If I were to do the project again, I would consider experimenting with designing my own board or one like this design which has a more modular arrangement and custom disc colors. These 7-segment flipdiscs also look really neat. Having access to the firmware would be a nice option when tuning performance. I also really wish I could’ve gone larger, but the expense of the panels really adds up fast. Unfortunately, right now, flipdiscs are more catered towards businesses (mostly the transportation industry) than the general consumer. Hopefully that changes. Alfazeta Shenzhen Xinqidian Opto Technology Factory Hanover Flipo Power To power the board, it needs a total 24V 1A per board, or 9A total to send enough power to flip all the dots. We ended up using a 24V 10A Meanwell power supply. MEAN WELL HLG-240H-24 Frame We built the frame using 80/20 aluminum extrusions, and screwed the PCB standoffs directly onto the frame. Word of caution: the boards and discs are incredibly fragile (My kids love to mess with them!) I read somewhere that flipdiscs are similar to butterfly wings, and I think that’s an appropriate analogy. It’s really easy to lose or break discs in the building process. Make sure to handle by the edges and carefully attach each board one-at-a-time. Here is a list of 80/20 parts that we purchased: (7) 1010 - cut to 25.2in (2) 1010 - cut to 49.65in (12) 33460 Corner Connector (72) M3x16MM screws (72) M3x10MM spacer 80/20 is really easy to assemble. I would also recommend the 10-series jig and bit for drilling mounting holes. We also built a wood frame out of birch. You could easily skip this part and just mount the 80/20 frame. Woodworking is beyond the scope of this article. Here are some photos of the final build. Cabling We connected each column in series, and then chained them all together. The data lines are +/- on the RS485 block terminal. We used 18AWG wire for the power lines and 22 AWG shielded cable for the data. It’s helpful to have some Wago Wire Lever Nuts for splicing and crimping terminals for the wire ends. If you want to achieve high framerates, make sure you’re using an RS485 line for no more than 6 panels. We used a total of 3 USB RS485 devices for the display. RS485 to ethernet servers are also great if you want to serve the content from an external server. Depending on the type of board that you get, here are some tools and parts that I recommend: (18) 5.08mm Pitch Male Female PCB Screw Terminal Block (4) Wago 221 Wire Lever Nuts (72) Wire Ferrules Ferrule Crimping Tool Wire stripper Processing We’re using machine learning for processing voice, video, and images so needed a little bit more processing power than a basic single-board computer or microcontroller. We ended up using a Nvidia Orin Nano. A Raspberry Pi would likely work too, although the framerate may start to suffer. We paired the Nvidia board with an IMX708 camera and a Waveshare audio board for audio input/output. We created a Dockerfile for deploying on Jetson 6.0. Mediapipe has to be compiled from source to enable the GPU. If you’re looking for an easier route, I would recommend a M2 Mac Mini, or if you want to skip the interaction you can go with a much more inexpensive solution, like a Raspberry Pi. Software Board Frame Format 0x800x830x01imageData0x8F Communication is over RS485. Each frame starts with a start byte [0x80], followed by either flush [0x83] or buffer [0x84], then the address of your board, then your image data, finally followed by an end byte [0x8F]. Image data is really easy since we only have two states [0, 1]. It also uses RLE for compressing each frame it sends over the wire. We created a basic library for using flipdisc screens in Node.js. It currently works with AlfaZeta and Hanover boards over USB and ethernet. Github. You can send data directly from a canvas instance using ctx.getImageData(0, 0, width, height), and it’ll cast the pixel data to either 1 or 0 based on luminance. Here is an example of how it works: import { createDisplay } from 'flipdisc' const path = '/dev/tty0' const display = createDisplay([[1], [2]], path) display.send(frameData) Driver Documentation npm install flipdisc We wanted to build something that could run real-time visualations with direct user feedback. This is unlike other low-pixel displays that pre-render assets to display on low-powered devices e.g. Pixlet from tidbyt. We knew we wanted to utilize webgl/canvas. There was no reason to re-invent the wheel with rendering libraries, so we’re leveraging existing web tech that we’ve found to work well - PIXI for general 2D rendering, Three.js for 3D rendering, Matter.js for physics engine, and GSAP for animations. We also utilize node-canvas, and node-gl for server-side rendering. For interactions, we’re using Google’s fantastic MediaPipe libraries and models. For a quick demo, check of their example of Gesture Recognizing. Since many ML libraries use python, we spawn python scripts from node to run most of the ML specific code, and then send the data back via ZeroMQ IPC. Maybe we’ll use Python WASM in the future. Here is an example of using the Gesture Recognizer in this project: const e = new GestureEmitter() scene.add(e) e.on('move', data => { if (data.gesture[0] == 'Open_Palm') { ball.position = data.position; } }) We created many different visualisations that can be toggled and customized on-demand. Each of these visualizations is represented as a scene and can be added to a queue. Playing a scene or managing the queue is accessible by a REST API. The live playing data is sent over websockets. Building a scene is straightforward. You can subscribe to events or add to the rendering queue with the useLoop function. Each scene file has to return both a scene and a schema and, optionally, a background task. A background task will run at a set interval, and if it returns successfully it’ll add a scene to the queue to play. Server DocumentationScene Examples npm install flipdisc-server Here is an example of a basic scene that shows an image. import { createScene, ImageView } from 'flipdisc-server' const schema = { title: 'Image', properties: { url: { type: 'string', default: 'image.png', }, } } const image = function(opts) { const scene = createScene() scene.once('loaded', () => { const img = new ImageView(opts.url) scene.add(img) }) return scene; } export { image as scene, schema } Here is a bit more of what the library helps take care of: A way to import scenes from a directory Live reload on scene files Background tasks that add a scene to the queue Easy UI components for text, images, lists, etc Flex layout based on Yoga. Basic getters and setup for pixi/three/matter as well as ability to add additional modules REST server and websocket for live data Easy way to use rendering loops, or GLSL shaders Interface I’ve built many projects in the past that become unusable because I no longer remember which command to run, or how to operate it. So, we wanted to make sure to build a reliable interface for the display. We settled on an expo app since it was the quickest way to prototype. As much as I love native apps, I cringe whenever I have to open Xcode. You can control all aspects of the display from the app - pause, start, skip, previous. You can configure scene variables to personalize the experience. You can also freehand draw right on the screen. Download it on the App Store. Here are some screenshots from the app: A few of the features are: Pause/play a scene Add or remove from queue Skip or previous in queue Watch live screen of what’s being shown on display Freehand draw on screen Send configuration variables to each scene Design Subspace was one of the first multiplayer games I played as a kid. The game allowed you to have a tiny 12x8 banner that you could design that would appear right next to your ship. I was blown away by what people could create with such limited space. I was soon hooked on designing my own. There was something about the strict limitation of pixels that lent itself to pushing creativity even further - you wanted to see how far you could push the medium. It’s easy to take for granted the sheer number of pixels we have at our disposal when working on the web. Being forced to distill things into the simplest information that you can convey is sometimes a blessing because you have to be very conscious and deliberate with the decisions you make. The 42x84 size of the flipdisc display felt like a similar exercise in constraints. The basic readable font that we use is a tiny 3x5 pixel font. There is also 4x5 and mono variants. If you want to go even smaller, there are 3x3 fonts and 3x4 nano fonts, but I feel like they lose too much legibility to be usable in practice. Anything over 12 pixels you can use most fonts with maintaining some legibility. Bitmap fonts are really great for these types of displays - especially since any anti-aliasing isn’t rendered. There are some really interesting archives of Bitmap designed fonts that could be fun to integrate. For images, we use a mixture of Floyd-Steinberg dithering and Bayer 4x4 ordered dithering. Below is an example that shows the difference in the two techniques. I prefer Floyd-Steinberg on images since it has a more natural pixel distribution, and Bayer on UI elements since it produces a consistent pattern. If you’re curious to learn more, here is a fantastic article on the subject - Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering Finally, below are some of the scenes that we designed for my office. They include a New York Times RSS reader, a Spotify client, a weather app, and many more. We’ll probably expand on this list as I figure out which stuff I want to casually glance at as I work. Next Steps: AI Wall Our goal is to make a transparent agent interface to AI utilizing new multi-modal input/output. Since a lot of these capabilities are right around the corner, we’re waiting on next-gen models to be released before pursusing this functionality. Conclusion I really had a fun time colaborating on this project. I do hope that flipdiscs become more accessible for hobbyists. If anyone wants to collaborate on new affordable flipdisc hardware, let me know! And, if you have any questions about how to build your own feel free to reach out.

Assuming (literally just a guess) that the tiles \"operate\" at a rate of 3 times per second playing back a video or something: (150 million operation) / (3 operations/ second) = 50 million seconds = 578 days It's likely much slower than 3 operations per second too - so probably 6-10x that in reality, which would be on the order of a decade of continuous runtime before they reach expected EOL. reply notatoad 2 hours agoprevi'm sure i'm not the only one who wanted this information: >AlfaZeta makes brand new displays, with a controller board.

Sorry for the confusion. reply simpsoka 3 hours agoparentprevThe disc moves, but there aren't any moving mechanical parts to cause it to move. It's done with electromagnetic pulses. I'll update it to make this more clear. reply crazygringo 1 hour agorootparentI don't really see what the distinction is? You might as well say a motor has no moving parts, because it's done with electromagnetic impulses. But that would be absurd. Obviously the hinge of each disc will wear and tear and eventually fail. Buildups of dust and oil will affect them too and prevent them from flipping. Flipdiscs are as mechanical as mechanical parts get. You writing in the intro: \"...have no moving parts, near limitless lifespan...\" is just not credible. And if I'm being entirely honest, that's where I stopped reading your post, because you simply didn't seem trustworthy. You might want to focus more an accuracy rather than hyperbole if you want to maintain readers. reply lucianbr 44 minutes agorootparentThe entire history of the world stands as proof that focusing on hyperbole maintains readers better :) Though I do wish for more accuracy. These things are totally moving parts, and there is no way they have even a long lifespan, let alone a \"near limitless\" one. Though to be precise, \"near limitless\" is meaningless. reply beatboxrevival 48 minutes agorootparentprevProbably because they are just a hobbyist and not an expert in the field (nor do they assert that they are). Maybe be a little kinder on the internet. It sounds like it was just a minor oversight. reply crazygringo 23 minutes agorootparent> Maybe be a little kinder on the internet. I really did think about whether or not to write that last paragraph. But the thing is, it's the truth. And I think it's going to be more helpful in the long run for authors to know these things. Believe me, I've been on the receiving end many times and it's made me a vastly better writer and communicator. When somebody stops reading your article because of a howler, it's much better for you to hear why so you can learn from it. (And you don't need to be an expert in the field to realize that discs that flip are mechanical, or that they don't have a \"near limitless lifespan\". These aren't exactly subtle mistakes, and it's one of the main justifications presented in the introduction itself.) reply simpsoka 4 minutes agorootparentThanks for the feedback.

    "commentBody": "A journey into Kindle AI slop hell (maxread.substack.com)173 points by didgeoridoo 23 hours agohidepastfavorite122 comments hosh 22 hours agoRoyal Road is one of the platforms for indie authors to publish serialized web novels. Many people use that to jump into a full time writing career -- successful new serials get on a ladder, paetrons get set up, and when enough chapters are written, they get edited and published to Kindle. The publication to Kindle Unlimited ends up with the books getting stubbed. In return though, you have a kind of presale so you know people like reading the work, and a sufficient fan base to appeal for support for a successful launch on KU. One of the things I've been seeing the authors reporting to their subscribers are people stealing that work by scraping the chapters, running it through LLM, and then publishing it on KU. Authors have been adding watermarks into the text, though I don't know how successful that is. (On the other hand, many authors use generative image AI to create covers, which has angered artists whose work has been sucked up by the generative AI machine). reply torginus 21 hours agoparentI really want to like Royalroad, as it's full of well-written stuff, made by clearly passionate and talented authors, but I can't help but notice that everything seems to some sort of Isekai/LitRPG/Progression novel where the protagonist fights anime-style battles and gets progressively more powerful, with sometimes numerical stats increasing, as presented by stat blocks in the story. This genre was completely unknown to me before I discovered RR, and I'm suprised how ubiquitous it is. Is this what young people want nowadays? The genre seems to have crossed over from Asian culture, with many novels being translations of Chinese/Korean ones. reply jtolmar 20 hours agorootparentLitRPG fans aren't all young people, it's also weirdly popular with middle-aged women with fond memories of playing World Of Warcraft. I don't think the phenomenon is young people these days, so much as every online fiction site slowly narrowing in on one subgenre over everything else, and Royal Road's being trashy power fantasies. I'm on a discord where authors discuss these things, and they talk a lot about the RR community and the hoops they need to jump through to match that specific group's specific tastes, because it's one of the niches where the money is right now. reply pragmatick 11 hours agorootparentHey now, I'm 42 and like some LitRPG / progression fantasy (only read Dungeon Crawler Carl, Mother of Learning and Cradle, though). reply idlemach 19 hours agorootparentprevOne factor you may be missing in the prevalence of Isekai/LitRPG/Progression Fantasy novels on RoyalRoad is that the original purpose of the site was to translate Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, a novel about a Virtual Reality MMORPG called Royal Road which was emblematic of the genre. From there, people started publishing fan fiction of the story, then their own similar novels, and more. The audience for the genre never left and is still the largest on the site, even if now there are other genres as well. reply red-iron-pine 5 hours agorootparentyeah important detail. like the site was created for and named after isekai, you're gonna get a lot of it reply TheOtherHobbes 21 hours agorootparentprevThat's genre fiction - a formula, with some reader-insert gratification. A site like RR is specifically aimed at readers who want those kinds of stories. Other fiction markets are the same. Mysteries, fantasy, thrillers, romance, all have their tropes and sub-tropes. Most don't have an RR equivalent because they're marketed through other communities, like TikTok for romance. Original fiction that doesn't follow strict genre rules and expectations is a very hard sell today - but I'm not sure that's ever been untrue. reply torginus 20 hours agorootparentI'm sure you are right but it didn't use to be this bad - I remember a couple of years ago I tried to familiarize myself with the old fantasy classics, most of which certainly weren't considered respectable literature back then. By far the worst offender of the bunch was Lin Carter's Under the Green Star - in which the sickly protagonist has his mind transported into a body of a powerful hero of legend, in a faraway realm, and rescues a beautiful princess who falls madly in love with him - at which point the teenage boy pandering became so unbearable, that I had to put the book down. This is exactly the tier wher most RR books stand at. Other books, such as the Elric books by Moorcock, or Leiber's Fafhrd books would still qualify as genre fiction, but have far more depth and nuance to them and I thoroughly enjoyed reading them. I wonder, what other sites are there for online fiction? I only know of Wattpad, which seems to largerly focus on romance for teenage girls, and AO3, which seems to focus on smut/fanfiction. While all 3 sites have hidden gems, it's too much of a bother for me to wade through the typical faire to bother looking for them. reply m463 10 hours agorootparentprevI read a few of these on kindle, some are ok, but some are just not very good at all. and they seem to seamlessly run into another genre called haremlit where the main character easily collects partners left and right. Now I tend to shy away from kindle unlimited and books with warnings about \"unconventional relationships\" (in my experience both mostly mean poor writing quality) If anyone has their own tips for picking not-a-waste-of-time books, I'd like to know. reply hosh 9 hours agorootparentI had found a few I like on RR. The authors will sometimes do a shoutout for ones they liked, or promote. That gets me a fairly good variety. reply hosh 18 hours agorootparentprevProgressive fantasy is what RR is known for, and many series like that launch from there. There are others that are progressive fantasy adjacent. Progressive fantasy covers litrpg (and its many variants including 4x rpgs), so-called “cultivation” fantasy (wuxia, xianxia, etc). It shouldn’t be surprising since fighting animes have been around for a long time, and now isekai animes are now the rage, and those all overlap into progressive fantasy. There is a subreddit for this. Other platforms will have other types of serials. I just don’t know them off the top of my head. My wife reads a romance serial somewhere else. reply Aerroon 20 hours agorootparentprev>Is this what young people want nowadays? Yes, but it's not just young people. >The genre seems to have crossed over from Asian culture, with many novels being translations of Chinese/Korean ones. You can basically trace a lot of the web novel versions back to anime/manga/light novels. (Maybe the reason is that in Asia these are also web novel, eg Shousetsuka ni Narou.) However, this kind of a genre is and was popular in the west independently of that. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote A Princess of Mars in 1912. It hits onto most of the same ideas these more modern stories do. reply vunderba 20 hours agorootparentprevIsekai (e.g. wish fulfillment + power fantasy) is absurdly popular in the anime/manga industry so I guess I'm rather unsurprised that its leaking over to more traditional novels as well. reply meowface 20 hours agorootparentAs an anime fan, I wish there were more series that strayed from this formula. So many are either isekai, \"protagonist has an ultimate power/entity inside them they can't fully control\", or both. reply hosh 18 hours agorootparentYou mean like Fieran? That is something author Blaise Corvin calls “exploration fantasy” and inspired him into attempting a new serial along that line. There is also Your Lie In April. Not a fantasy or reincarnation. There are few other exceptional ones here and there. reply meowface 3 hours agorootparentFunnily enough I was actually going to write \"Frieren is the only one that comes to mind that doesn't follow this formula\", but I figured it would sound way too myopic since surely that can't be the only one. reply torginus 14 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I was just thinking about this - there have been many manga series (which get turned into anime eventually), that started out with an interesting premise that can be taken into many directions, only to turn into a cookie-cutter shonen battle manga. I think I know the reason for this - shonen is a relentless popularity contest, where magazines only feature the most popular works and will quickly drop your series once it starts losing readers. The way to consistently stay on top is to appeal to the biggest demographic - that is shonen battle/isekai fans by making your stuff to be exactly like the other stuff. But doing so makes you lose the readers who were interested in the thing that made your manga unique in the first place. And after a time, these people will stop reading the publication altogether, skewing fan demographics even more towards genre fiction, making it even more impossible to create something unique. I have seen this happen multiple times. reply Aerroon 19 hours agorootparentprevAnime/manga are pretty strongly intertwined with (web) novels in Japan. Those same novels are fan translated into English (Chinese and Korean too). This has created a kind of fanbase for web novels/self-published novels. Japanese companies starting to send copyright claims against fan translations probably opened the door for Chinese, Korean, and English web novels like that. reply LordDragonfang 20 hours agorootparentprevAs a (perhaps not-so-young) consumer of several RR stories in those exact genres, yes. It's a fun genre that really tickles the same part of my brain that building munchkins in D&D does. Progression fantasy is just very satisfying to read. (In case anyone is looking for recommendations, Mother of Learning is the best all-around, Delve is probably my favorite, and Worth the Candle is incredible if you can stomach how much of a crapsack world the protagonist is dragged through) reply where-group-by 11 hours agorootparentIf we're doing recommendations I would like to add my own, which are: - bog standard isekai - isekai with numbers, but it's more of a horror story, at least for book 1 - hope - which actually isn't isekai, nor litrpg, but still fantasy about a young protag - death by chocolate - a detective cyberpunk story reply WereAllMadHere 20 hours agoparentprevI don't think there's a comparison between the AI book scraping and the generated covers. One is using a tool to create a new artwork, one is using a tool for plagiarism. reply hosh 18 hours agorootparentThat is not how the artists I have talked to see it. Many are very angry about it. When I asked one about the generated cover, she came right back with, why didn’t the author reach out to work with them? And now, DeviantArt is collapsing, as artists flee, and content is being dominated by automated generative AI spamming out content. Now, I understand the frustration of someone able to see something in their head and is unable to put it into drawing. Storywriting is already an all-consuming discipline … but so is anything creative. reply torginus 13 hours agorootparentHonestly I don't get why people use GenAI covers. You can get a surprisingly decent if basic cover for as little as $50 (lots of artists in Latam and SEA willing to work for not very much), and if you're willing to drop a couple hundred on it, great artists will make line up to work with you. Considering the time and effort that goes into writing a book, if you value your own time, and work, this should be a no-brainer. reply disqard 3 hours agorootparentIt's low-effort, and, once enough time has passed, it'll be this decade's equivalent of those trivial-to-add \"blink\" or \"marquee\" tags from the geocities times. Fast-forward 5 years, and our attitude might be: Hmmm, so you added an AI-generated image to your AI-generated slop \"post\", everybody knows \"those\" pages. Not gonna waste my time here. reply pizzalife 20 hours agorootparentprev>One is using a tool to create a new artwork, one is using a tool for plagiarism. Is it \"new artwork\", though? That's the big question. I would say both are tools for plagiarism. reply lelandfe 22 hours agoprev> Is Amazon cutting out the author middle man and using A.I. and user data to generate books on its own?

Lately I've noticed that in self pub pulp land authors are trading shoutouts with each other without curation or discretion, but even those are self selecting to a higher degree of 'gives a shit' than what the algo reccs have been offering. I think it has been over a year since I found something off of the 'if you liked X' carousel and that used to be extremely reliable for me. And like I said, I'm reading pulp.

I've been talking to people outside this bubble, and the unanimous response to all the \"exciting\" AI developments of the last ~3 years has been that their experience of generative AI has been purely negative with no upsides whatsoever. All they see is the content slop, the shitty search results, degraded experiences in e.g. customer service, and so on. And it's starting to alarm me that nobody in tech appears to care about this and is just going \"damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead\". That kind of arrogant dismissal of popular mood and forcing unwanted change on people is how resentment and revolution happen. reply medhir 21 hours agoparentThink it’s worth calling out that many people in tech have significant reservations about the reckless push of generative AI into just about every product — the issue is the executive class that insists on chasing hype and potential short-term stock growth over everything else. reply wkat4242 21 hours agoparentprevI think AI has a place in this world. As does virtual reality, the previous hype. The problem with these hypes is, the overstressed business types that think it is the key to the future for everything. Almost nothing is the next internet. And in a year or so when they don't see their 2000% payoff, they will consider it a flop, which will also harm the genuine efforts that were made and usecases where the tech does add value. It's the overexpectations that hurt it. The problem starts happening when you shoehorn it into a bunch of shit for the sake of it, where it adds no value and often even degrades it. Like what everyone is now doing with AI. Especially Microsoft. It's great for some stuff, like making summaries. It's not GenAI and if we try to use it as such (as Nadella is doing) the bubble will burst sooner rather than later and that's bad for the tech community as a whole. I find the journey super interesting however from a personal tech interest point of view and I love playing with it locally. But I'm not blind to its glaring limitations and I don't care whether it makes money or not, I'm just into it for the tech. It's the money boys that keep blowing good stuff up. reply lanstin 16 hours agorootparentIt's almost like capital has become so big that the investment money sloshing around looking for high returns at the expense of anything else, does not care if excessive capital ruins the early dot.com companies, real estate, crypto, generative AI or anything else. We need an investor class that just wants to get their 50 pounds a year to maintain the country estate, not one that wants to vacuum up 80% of the economy in short term speculative bubbles. reply hattmall 13 hours agorootparentIt's ultimately a lack of \"class\". The scenario you're describing requires that the wealthy maintain a set of social virtues that are more important than money. One of those virtues must then be that greed is seen as very low class. It's the stereotypical depiction of new vs old money. It does exist in the US, but it's mainly in certain industries and the uber wealthy are generally shunned / excluded because to be focused on the pursuit of money is taboo. It's literally the primary differentiator, \"I'm so rich we don't care about money.\" Even though they are nowhere near as rich as billionaires. To be seen as concerned about making money shows a lack of class and even if you have billions of dollars from a social standpoint your no different than any random poor person working paycheck to paycheck. So that investment class certainly is out there, but it's not really in places like California, New York, Florida etc. Those areas and the industries spawned in them are dominated by the profit obsessed social pariahs. Of course money and investments are a major aspect but it's never about how much money you can make, all the pursuits are profitable, but it's about how much importance and control they will generate. Most Tech, Crypto, AI, anything like that, if it gets shut down tomorrow, the impacts are minimal and easily mitigated. People involved lose money, but everyone else carries on, possibly somewhat inconvenienced. If a regional cold storage facility, railroad, pipeline, quarry, or container yard decides to shut down you have real impacts that start to get serious quickly. reply rchaud 21 hours agorootparentprevVR doesn't have anywhere near the same level of fossil fuel emissions as AI though. reply AlexandrB 20 hours agorootparentCrypto certainly does. reply rustcleaner 18 hours agorootparentCrypto mining is where solar system companies will go as states start letting grid operators only net meter instead of paying you for power your system puts in. reply wkat4242 8 hours agorootparentI don't think so.

It is astonishing how well insulated from common concerns tech workers are, which is probably how we got shit like Juicero, an incredibly overbuilt, over-spec, ludicrously designed wifi-connected machine to squeeze a fucking bag. And it explains a bunch of their other incredibly stupid ideas, like e-scooters. This is why, I am sorry, but I simply do not put a lot of stock (literally, and metaphorically) into the opinions of SV's elites. That's like, a bubble in a damn bubble.

Bringing it back to what I was replying to: you are absolutely right about the common folk's experience with AI. It's an annoying thing being shoved into tons of products they use, that seemingly no one asked for, that doesn't work.

SV companies want to disrupt every industry, irrespective of if the inefficiencies present are down to organizational inertia on the part of the market holders, or whether those inefficiencies are down to a myriad of other reasons we might want to do any given thing a little slower and more carefully than we otherwise might. Like, for example, background checks for taxi drivers before we give them the job of transporting strangers, alone, with zero oversight. That's not to say the taxi industry prior to Uber was saintly, far fucking from it.

I wanted to have a cooking show style contest and needed a bunch of dishes to be the competition. Here's one of the results I got: Underdark Goulash: Ingredients: Drow's darkstone potatoes (akin to sweet potatoes but darker, and with a slightly bitter tang), glimmerstool mushrooms (glow in the dark and have a smoky flavor), sahuagin seaweed (a deep-sea plant with a salty taste), and roper spices (ground up, they have a robust, gamy flavor). Description: A hearty dish that pays homage to the unrelenting grit of an Underdark adventure. The darkstone potatoes and glimmerstool mushrooms provide a flavorsome base. The sahuagin seaweed's saltiness is reminiscent of the sea, while the roper spices add an unexpectedly pleasant gamey note. Much like an adventurer finding comfort in the dark caves, sometimes the most uncommon combinations lead to a profound satisfaction. And they're all this good, like what the hell? How is this thing so creative? And it got exactly the snobby pander to the judges tone I asked for. The AIs don't have any clue how to make a compelling narrative or interesting characters but for some reason it understands nouns. It comes up with really cool items, settings, shops, interior details that show-don't-tell details I'm looking for.

Would love to hear any kinds of stories or tips from folks muffinman26 20 hours agoA variation of this question gets asked semi-regularly on HN, but I think the reason the results so often seem unsatisfying is that the people who actually find a meaningful answer and switch careers aren't hanging out on Hacker News anymore. They're living their life and have found community with other people doing what they actually want to do. As a result, the Hacker News responses are often incredulity that anyone could ever leave the software industry (even if it's a miserable soul-draining place), or slight career shifts that aren't really career shifts, with a little bit of Financial Independence Retire Early thrown in. Now, where to find the community of folks who have left Hacker News for something they genuinely enjoy, that would be great to know. reply qqqwerty 19 hours agoparentThere are plenty of good answers here. There just really isn't anything out there that is remotely close to SWE in terms of comfort, pay, and accessibility. For the last decade or so, SWE has been one of the most accessible and lucrative professions that mankind has ever seen. Before that, most folks needed to go the finance/lawyer/doctor route to access similar levels of financial security. And those professions require significantly more trade offs than SWE (more training, worse work life balance, etc...) The fact is, you are not going to make SWE level salary doing hobby level woodworking in your garage. You can get into the trades and with a fair amount of time and effort you might be able to pull in the equivalent of a junior level SWE salary. But the trades are rough on your body and you will pay for that later. Or you can try and transition to other types of white collar work, most of which will never come close to what a SWE gets paid. And of course, these answers are pretty personal. I have a few too many hobbies and would be more than happy to spend a few years making not very much money trying to turn some of those into paying gigs, but I also have a wife who has a well established career and we have kept our expenses in check. If you are the sole bread winner and sitting on an expensive mortgage and sending your kids to pricey private schools, then your options are going to be much more limited. Also, just to keep this conversation a bit more productive. I would recommend looking into jobs that are software related (or software adjacent) in interesting fields. i.e. construction, energy, biotech, government labs, etc... You will almost certainly take a pay cut, and you will still get some of the typical SWE BS, but it is much less pronounced in my experience. reply muffinman26 19 hours agorootparentMaybe it's true that >> There just really isn't anything out there that is remotely close to SWE in terms of comfort, pay, and accessibility. Making the jump from there to keeping a software job being the right choice for everyone makes a lot of values assumptions, though. I personally can't stand working at a desk all day. If I stick to software engineering, there's no way to get away from the desk. Similarly, I value sending my kids to a public school where they aren't limited to a bubble, and I don't need an expensive house. There are people who genuinely love physical labor. I have family who still live on a farm and didn't even own a computer last I heard. Sure, they're not making SWE money, but they're happy with their life. Their son went off to school but chose to come back to the farm. I have family who happily spent their entire working lives as carpenters/woodworkers and are still very able, but there are plenty of Hacker News responses that claim all carpenter/woodworkers end up cripples. reply burutthrow1234 21 hours agoprevNothing is gonna give you good, consistent comp like writing software. I'm sure some sales people do very well but \"eat what you kill\" also means lean months, and sometimes whether or not deals close is outside of your control. My advice is to just get a tech job where you can coast, work from home, and knock out a couple tickets a day. Have lots of flexibility to see your kid and take vacations while they're young. Some places offer 4 day weeks and you still take home 6 figures. Sales Engineering or Customer Success would be an interesting pivot but you usually make less money and have less flexibility than SWEs reply itsoktocry 20 hours agoparent>My advice is to just get a tech job where you can coast, work from home, and knock out a couple tickets a day. Bingo. We in this field are getting accustomed to extreme compensation. But do you know how many SMBs would love to have a capable \"tech person\" for $60-80k per year? If you're remote you can probably work half days. This is my plan, after I finish the grind. reply Vegenoid 20 hours agorootparentI think there are actually not that many SMBs that want a tech person who limits their working hours and won't handle problems that come up on evenings, weekends, and holidays. That is, they don't want an IT person who won't return their after-hours emergency call. And SMB owners are not very good at determining what is an IT emergency. reply willsmith72 19 hours agorootparentYep. In my experience, SMBs can be a nightmare for an SWE. Multi year long estimations, expectations of perfection and 0 bugs/downtime, lack of understanding of complexity, 0 ownership/empowerment, old tech with 0 tests. Of course ymmv, just my 2c. reply Sammi 12 hours agoparentprev> My advice is to just get a tech job where you can coast My soul dies when I try this. I can't look in the mirror and like the person looking back. I feel myself rot. I need challenge. I need to be useful. Most dev shops infantalise their devs and don't allow them to do actual useful hard work. So I'm currently attempting a bootstrapped startup. Because I want to work. reply nickd2001 9 hours agorootparentA compromise exists :) - Public sector (e:g govt or academia). Due to lack of a need to show quarterly profits, its less stressful. But its also challenging. You can work hard, with intelligent people, on stuff that matters, but you won't get asked to work the weekend. Flexible family-friendly working can be a thing. Base pay is usually less than private sector. But pension likely to be better. And, getting burned out and/or laid-off is expensive. As is trying to save tons to get out of a hell-hole. Whereas, chugging along doing interesting fulfilling work for years at the same place with people you get along with, seems a good option for me. I recommend this to everyone :) reply extragood 20 hours agoparentprevTo your last point, that's basically what I did. I get a lot of satisfaction from being the technical consult for customers, working alongside Sales and CS, and still having that link back to engineering. The kicker is that I get paid about the same. The right company will highly value a competent customer-facing engineer. reply talldatethrow 20 hours agoparentprevWhether deals close or not is always technically outside your control. What's not outside your control is how many deals you currently have working, so that you aren't reliant on one particular deal closing so that you have income in the immediate next few months. Obviously the hard part is what happens when things happen to go your way and 3 deals close at the same time. But if you can figure out how to deal with that, most problems with the ups and downs of sales are taken care of. reply ryandrake 18 hours agoparentprevI moved over from SWE to Project Management. Yes, I make far, far less money than similarly-leveled SWEs, but I feel like I have more flexibility and I'm not on the treadmill than I was as a perpetual JIRA ticket puncher. It's not for everyone, but if you want a change of pace and would rather not leave tech entirely, there are options. reply piloto_ciego 20 hours agoparentprevAviation does but the road to it is challenging and you can end up like me where you end up having to do something else if you get sick reply swedonym 19 hours agoparentprevI 100% agree with this. Big tech jobs, or those at medium sized firms, are easy to coast in. I've heard that at some FAANG companies Senior SWE can be viewed as a terminal level and it's totally acceptable to have a flat career trajectory here. Consistent, stable, and reliable salary with an average amount of work sounds good to me, you just need to have a high tolerance for BS. reply level1ten 17 hours agorootparentFAANG does layoffs all the time, even high performers. How is that consistent, stable, or reliable? reply mrbirddev 6 hours agorootparentprev> high tolerance for BS This is really important. You will spend your whole life aligning stake holders. If you can't stand that and started searching for meaning of life then eventually you end up quitting. reply pmarreck 20 hours agoparentprevI was considering sales engineering because I get along with both engineers and salespeople and I hear they actually make more money than either, if they're any good, but someone discouraged me, saying that if you crave the creative portion of the SWE job, sales engineering is not going to cut it for you. I'm still fascinated by the idea for some reason. Closing a big deal (and making that commission on top of a regular base salary) while understanding all the technical sides of a product sounds like a neat way to get that \"dopamine hit\" wave going. (you know, motivation -> work -> success -> enjoyment of success -> motivation) Building out big software features often seems like yet another lesson about ever-receding goalpost lines. I will say that a work situation DID show me that I DO need the creative element though- I worked for Deloitte once, building out some enterprisey software for clients for a time and due to business reasons outside my control, they halted all new development on the product and switched to pure support/bugfix mode. My job satisfaction absolutely PLUMMETED. Another side gig I found fun was... and I don't even know what the name of this job is because I only did it a couple times but it was fun both times... \"objective technical performance evaluator\". Basically, there are situations out there with nontechnical businesspeople who have hired offshore software engineering labor who end up jerking them around a bit to the point where they suspect they're being jerked around (you can't fool people forever) but they cannot point to anything in particular, so they hire YOU to sit in on calls and call out the BS. I can't tell you how shamefully fun it was to call out other SWE teams on their BS while the businesspeople on whose side you're advocating for are grinning next to you. Essentially, businesspeople hiring offshore SWE teams ALWAYS need an advocate on their side who \"talks the talk\". It basically works like this- you get github access, you sit in on some calls, you ask some very pointed questions, and then you write up a report about the code, the time things are taking, the designs being proposed or created, etc. With ChatGPT help, writing up such a report would be cake- you could basically just brain-dump a bunch of observed facts into a text file and ask it to create an organized professional report for you- you can even ask it to make it strongly-worded, etc. Easy money, everybody's happy! reply marcus0x62 20 hours agorootparent> I was considering sales engineering because I get along with both engineers and salespeople and I hear they actually make more money than either, if they're any good Hi, former Sales Engineer/Manager here. SEs do not make more than their sales counterparts in salary/commission, and usually don’t make more in stock (although they often think they do.) In my best years, I would make half what my sales peer made. In bad years, I could make more as a percentage, but only because sales people are usually more leveraged (50/50 base/commission vs 70-80% base for an SE.) reply nunez 16 hours agorootparentDefinitely true, but given that sales folks were always always always on, I'd argue they make less per hour than SEs do. reply marcus0x62 8 hours agorootparentBeing an SE is the definition of an always-on job. The stress is (or, can be,) different than what an account manager faces, but the same underlying dynamic is the same: you're only ever as good as your last quarter and you can never achieve \"enough\". Beyond the mental aspects, SEs are frequently inserted, either officially or unofficially, in all manner of customer support processes like case escalation, managing beta software builds, arbitrating between the customer and professional services engineers, etc. reply ethbr1 16 hours agorootparentprev> saying that if you crave the creative portion of the SWE job, sales engineering is not going to cut it for you. To me, this is what separates customer-facing engineering from product engineering: do you enjoy solving people problems in addition to technical ones? If so, you'll probably enjoy SE & CS. If not, then stick to product engineering. Personally, I get a decent kick out of solving problems. Whether that's because I aligned 3 VPs or wrote a technical solution doesn't change the enjoyment. That said, I definitely wouldn't enjoy solving problems without any technical component. reply roughly 20 hours agoprevSomething worth considering here is that while the software industry is indeed a cesspool of shitty management, wheel reinvention, and peter-pan syndrome, software itself and the ability to write it is one of the biggest providers of leverage in the modern world. Consider finding a role or opportunity to write software for people doing something you find meaningful - you can provide an enormous amount of value, and a good technical person is basically a wizard to people who aren't steeped in this kind of thing. The parts of my current role where I've gotten to work directly with scientists to help them solve complex problems have been by far the most interesting and rewarding things I've done in my career. reply tmpz22 20 hours agoparent> Consider finding a role or opportunity to write software for people doing something you find meaningful - you can provide an enormous amount of value I agree with the premise but I want to play devil's advocate because you can cause harm trying to help in this manner: Consider a non-technical org like a non-profit that does marketing-like activities to further its cause. You can build automation for that using SaaS tools binding together a handful of their manual processes. But what happens if you leave? What happens if some of the vendors you picked disappear? How much of your time is now committed to maintaining that software? Software is brittle. It takes a lot of empathy, time, and long-term thinking to effectively integrate software with an organization steeped in manual processes. So ultimately when you ask \"Can I help here\" also ask \"Should I help here\". A six hour training in spreadsheets can sometimes provide more value then a thousand hours of software development. reply roughly 19 hours agorootparentCompletely agree with this, and I think this is one of the areas where genuinely senior people distinguish themselves: finding the right mix of systems building and capacity building to provide a durable increases in the organization's capabilities, instead of just making a big flashy show and then leaving. I actually really enjoy building systems for less technical folks - it requires you to learn enough about the problem space and how the users think about the world to create the right interfaces and abstraction layers, but when you do it right, it's phenomenal how fast people can move and how much they can get done. The amount of compute power out there is mind boggling, and when you can actually open that up in a way where people who are less tech-focused can leverage it, you can enable some really incredible stuff. reply mrbirddev 6 hours agoparentprev> shitty management, wheel reinvention, and peter-pan syndrome I just can't agree more. Met so many arrogant & immature people in this industry. Including the younger me myself. reply haswell 20 hours agoprevMy recommendation after 20 years or so in tech: if you can, take a sabbatical that’s long enough to completely reset, and then re-assess. Travel, read, try stuff, do personal projects, do nothing for awhile. I started a sabbatical two years ago, and in the beginning I was convinced that I didn’t want to ever work in tech again. In retrospect, that was at least partially the burnout talking. It took me over a year before I started warming to the idea again, and I’m now fairly certain I’ll go back to a tech role, but with a very different perspective both on life and on whatever roles I take going forward. There’s something incredibly valuable about fully replacing your routines and truly taking a break. I sold some stock to make it happen, and it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. reply charlie0 19 hours agoparentThis is the way. I've heard of the idea that you should seek to re-invent/re-evaluate your life every 7-10 years. Things change, you get older and so does everyone else around you. I find that if you don't take time off to do this consciously and willingly, life will force this upon you one way or another. I'd rather do this proactively and I really do believe taking time off is the best way to break \"the mirage\" and re-think your life. reply haswell 17 hours agorootparentLooking back, I wish I had done this a decade sooner. Going forward, I definitely plan to make this a regular thing. Long before burnout can take hold again. reply nickd2001 9 hours agoparentprevThis is good advice :) There's a lot to like in tech but it can indeed burn people out, and some time away from it doesn't hurt. I also took a sabbatical, years ago, and ultimately returned to tech. I worked the ski season, travelled in summer and lived on little. If you're frugal and do bits of work that pays a little, its possible to do this and have barely eroded savings after a year or so.

As an example, I created a modified level so that my wife could set tumblers up for full wrap laser engraving. I’ve been trying to figure out how to sell the tool but maybe there is not much of a market to sell to. I’ve tried my own website, a free DIY version as an email collection tool, becoming active on laser forums, the finished level on Etsy, and now a DIY kit on Etsy. I can’t seem to sell them. I’ve met similar issues with other items I’ve designed. So, “scratch your own itch” doesn’t seem to create a market fit for me or I have trouble finding that market. Halp! reply dangrossman 20 hours agorootparentI know the guy that sells a tumbler level for the xTool P2 to do full wraps. He does some online classes too. He found his customers by being active in the P2's Facebook groups from when the product first launched. I don't see any evidence it's generating more than pizza money for him.

I feel the same. 1. Huge cognitive load to deal with when you started taking responsibility for others code . Even worse if you still need to code. 2. No person skills growth. Managing engineers is not real world management to me. It's way too simple and just chores. 3. No business sense growth. You just implement. You don't face the customers/users. You eventually lose connection to the real world. \"asymmetrical amount of value\" comes from tackling real world problem instead of \"arguing about the structure of software\". Maybe it's just me and OP. reply purple-leafy 16 hours agoprevI didn’t leave, I’m still in it. But I dropped a day of work and took a salary sacrifice. Really bad burnout made me hate work, stopped me from enjoying coding, made me lose my confidence in tech, and made me feel like a slave to working without an external life. Dropping just 1 day has been the largest mental health benefit I have ever had, and I don’t think I will ever work a second over 32 hours a week. Nor will I ever work 5 days a week. But I made major life changes at the same time. I deleted my last remaining bastion of social media - Reddit, due to extreme political new, and toxicity. I switched to hackernews as my only form on “social” media. I also blocked global and local news sites on all my devices. That has been incredibly relieving. I moved out of my expensive house. I got back into gaming, realising that giving it up removed a powerful way for me to relieve stress. Now I’m passionately working on side projects again on weekends, and the extra day is awesome. And I’m generally happy. My phone screen time has dropped from an average 5-6hours on average over the last year, to under 2 hours a day average the past month. Also one other thing about the elephant in the room - “AI”, I’ve changed my views on it quite some. It truly is overhyped, I’ve stopped using GitHub CoPilot completely, and mostly just use LLMs as a shallow surface search engine. Try not to worry about your job, I don’t think it’s going to take it anytime soon, and it’s also not going to make anyone a 10X Engineer. Maybe clever people will become 1.5X developers, and people the rely on LLMs too much will become 0.5X developers, so it balances out reply marcog1 20 hours agoprevThis might not help you, but it might help someone earlier in their career. I was born, raised and studied in South Africa. Living costs and salaries are cheaper. I worked in California. Instead of living a lavish lifestyle, I saved. In hindsight, I should have saved even more. The important thing I did was opting for cheaper housing. I worked hard, which opened doors. I landed up at a startup that's now doing really well. I retired after just six years. Six more years later, I'm doing what I want. I've been cycling around Europe and Africa. Next week I'm flying to Canada to explore North America for the next two years. It's a pretty cheap lifestyle, but I get to experience life around the world in a way few people ever do. I'm working on building a presence on YouTube. I've met others who sustain their travels via YouTube. Even if I don't, I can keep going for quite some time living off of savings. I wouldn't be able to do this so easily if it weren't for stock. I'm not advocating a travel lifestyle. Instead, I'm advocating for saving up while you're earning decent cash. Don't blow it all. Then hopefully you can leave for what you really want to do, and not be tied down due to finances. reply ericyd 20 hours agoparentNot only is this unrelated to the OP, but it's also not actionable advice. Sounds like you got lucky and got a bunch of great stock.

Sure everyone can save more but that likely won't result in massive lifestyle changes in a short time frame. reply Taylor_OD 20 hours agorootparentKind of depends. Plenty of people COULD live like a monk and save a ton over 6 years. But that requires not having a family and likely not enjoying your life very much. I probably COULD live on significantly less than I make right now. Hell, I have in the past. But I sure didnt enjoy it very much. But if you lived on rice and beans in the cheapest place you could find while making a 6 figure salary... Saving a very significant sum every year would be possible. reply yreg 20 hours agorootparentprevSix years is certainly lucky, but it's easy to save working as SWE. There are people living in your city on a tiny fraction of your income. A person without commitments could save the entire diff, if they wanted to. And travelling is cheap as well, I have a friend who is travelling long term for like $300-600 a month, including all the transportation costs, etc. (The opportunity cost of not working is obviously much higher though.) reply wing-_-nuts 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah for real. I think that any dev can retire by 50 if they want to. Maybe by 40 if they really put in effort, but if you're retiring before your mid 30's you're either 'leanFire' meaning you've basically committed yourself to a life of relative poverty or you somehow got hold of a 'lotto ticket', and that, by definition is extremely rare and not something anyone should plan for. reply benzible 20 hours agorootparentprev\"I wouldn't be able to do this so easily if it weren't for stock\" does not. It's misleading to attribute early retirement to a frugal lifestyle and savings when it appears that they hit the lottery. reply necheffa 20 hours agorootparentprev> \"Save while you're earning decent cash\" seems pretty actionable to me.

That hasn't been true for a long time, with inflation & taxes grinding away at any marginal gains. I wish I'd financed and leveraged more, not consumption goods but investments. The other problem with being a saver is it's very hard to be one, then flip and be a consumer of your savings. The thing that makes you able to save is also what holds you back from spending.

I was at a company I thought I loved, but some disagreements over equity, some random marketing manager, and some code quality issues from another lead engineer who was closer with the founder, I was burnt out, and just said fuck it one day, and basically told them fuck you and left. Over the past 3 years, I've done various small projects and started startups, but haven't had the same passion since my last startup, and haven't settled on something since, all I know is I still enjoy coding sometimes... and I know I don't want to work for anyone else ever again. I'm just burnt out in different ways... and feel like I have too many things to keep up with now. So my advice if you do take a sabbatical have a concrete plan to keep yourself busy, relaxed and motivated, something I didn't do.

In South Korea, Samsung workers, students drop out or graduate from elite degrees and opting for simple life. White collar jobs used to be rewarding and highly paid but overtime it became a glorified day care for adults with Animal Farm dynamics. It's especially bad in Asian countries with strict social hierarchy. It's no wonder more and more young men are ditching white collar jobs for blue collar workers. But for some growing # of females (and even smaller number of men), it seems like they are opting to sell images/videos of themselves engaging sexually arousing or sexually explicit content while also engaging in legitimate white collar work. Again in Asia, this trend is even more rampant especially Japan, 40 years ago you couldn't dream of seeing 18 year olds standing on the streets of Tokyo but now they seem to everywhere. I'm frightened by the whole thing. If young graduates are heading to workshop instead of office, it means they aren't going to be consuming like they used to.

You need to find something you can run towards. Do you like what you do and not who you have to work with? Perhaps you want a job in your field that's \"good enough\" where you take a pay cut for better quality of life (defense, govt contracting, big banking, life sciences, non tech companies that still have hard software problems). Do you like building but you want to call the shots on something you want to build for a decade? Perhaps entrepreneurship is for you. But, it's tough -- having made the transition, you trade off one set of people problems (and lack of agency) for another. Net-net it's more stressful and while the highs are higher, the lows are much lower. Do you want a completely different field entirely? I've seen folks purchase blue collar flavored \"lifestyle businesses\" (self-storage, landscaping, etc) and scratch the entrepreneurship itch \"in the small\". I've seen folks shift to building physical things (taking up welding or woodworking), but you run into the physical constraints of your body which can present challenges. But, this is probably the hardest path for me to answer or advise towards, in part because it requires you abandoning or at least closing the chapter you've build your career experience inside of. Best of luck. I'd start with the first question; it sounds like you've worked at companies with \"ambitious\" technologists and found a common thread of misdirected ambition. That doesn't necessarily mean that you can't find a happy home inside technology.

When I left my last SWE job (after 10 years in the industry), I had money saved and was coming off of very challenging changes in my personal life. So for the first year, I gave myself a lot time to rest, take care of health challenges I had been procrastinating on, and getting back into video games and anime for the first time since college. Through video games and VR chat I got into 3D modeling as a hobby, which I would continue to learn doing while also exploring some other things (volunteering for a political campaign, and interpersonal mental health coaching). Eventually I got excited to move to LA to take classes at Gnomon, which was quite expensive but also extremely enjoyable. I honestly never expected to actually work in this field since I did not dedicate myself fully to it, and it's a tough industry. But one of my classmates referred me to a job at a major tech company that wasn't that glamorous, but paid well and suited my very limited skill set. So here I am. All in all, there was about 5 years between my last SWE job and my first 3D modeling job (with some coaching work in between but it was very low paying). Certainly that time gap could be shortened, as I was not fully dedicating myself to it, but it would have also been a much less enjoyable process and transition if there was pressure to support a family behind it. If I'm going to give you any tips, is if you're trying to start a family I highly recommend finding a boring easy tech job that doesn't require your full capacity so that you 1) make enough money to not be stressed about it, and 2) have plenty of time to focus on non-work related things. There are tons of boring roles that are.. well, boring, but not stressful or soul draining.

This is a long post, but I think it is a relevant option to the apathy and disdain you're feeling from the daily grind you're in. The ENTIRE JOB is working with a salesperson and leveraging people, strategy and your tech experience to get the technical win for (usually large) sales. While a big part of doing the job is giving demos and (sometimes) showing slides, because you have to know a lot about the product, you can still flex your software chops without worrying about story points. IOW, if you're at a tech company that sells libraries for $x, you'll still need to write code using those libraries so that you can speak to $x, connect with the people you'll be \"pitching\" to and getting to that technical win. This will scratch the itch of wanting to code without having to play a story to do it. No prospecting, cold-calling, contract negotiating, or other sales-y activities required. You'll make less than a FAANG SWE but more than a non-FAANG SWE. The average is $230k-ish, 70% salary, 30% commission. Unless you have a good commission year. Then you can make WAY MORE than a typical FAANG SWE. Some SEs earn $400k+ on a good year. Still less than a Staff/Sr. Staff+ FAANG SWE (which comes with many more responsibilities that you would consider bullshit). (Something that doesn't get talked about very much here is how much software sales people can make. There are definitely sales folks pulling in multiple millions per year. That $10B JEDI contract that Microsoft won? There were salespeople and SEs assigned to that account...and $10B is a big number. That said, sales is a MEAT GRINDER.) Almost all sales engineers I know have awesome work life balance as well. There are days when we're up to our eyes in work, but there are other days when we have absolutely nothing on our calendar. For days. You also (within reason) set your own schedule. At the last two places I've done SE work for, if I wanted time off, I put it on the calendar and invite my salesperson. Some places will ask you to put into your HR system, but it depends. If I need to take off during the middle of the day for something important, I pop that on the calendar, and we make it work. I could NEVER EVER do that before, and it's super cool. Getting into the field with zero experience is, unfortunately, pretty hard. I'd try to move laterally into it at your current company first or network with SE managers, either IRL or on LinkedIn. However, if you're seriously considering leaving tech (please don't! The world outside of tech IS ROUGH AS SHIT), I'd give this a try. Another avenue that you can pursue is consulting. It's post-sales, so you'll still be grinding, but you get to hop from client to client without getting too attached to how they do things. If you're more on the strategy side, you can, eventually, run accounts and mostly have conversations with stakeholders about where they want to go. It's harder than presales and usually has lots of travel attached, but it's an option. Source: Am in presales now, did consulting for 5-ish years, was a SRE for years and years prior to that. I left FTE eng jobs because I wanted to travel more and traveling as an engineer always comes with huge strings attached. I sometimes imagine going back and going real deep into the stack like I used to but then think about the story points and changing directions and other general Tom-foolery that comes with engineering and stay put. reply mindwok 20 hours agoprevGive sales a try.

It was 2003. I was 20 years old, looking to buy something used in the $3-7000 range. I didn't have my heart set on any specific car, I just knew I wanted a 4-door sedan with air conditioning, and that I cared more about fuel economy and reliability than performance. I mean, I was only making $11/hr, and was probably going to be moving out of my parents' within the next year or two, so needed something that wouldn't cost me a ton of money. I told each dealer that, and most of them took me to cars that met the criteria I was looking for, but one of them started off by showing me a $12,000 Pontiac Sunfire Convertible and started raving about the incredible Alpine stereo heat unit. 2-door, no A/C, and way above my price range. I was like \"Uh...no, not at all what I asked for\" and re-iterated my criteria, and added that while a nice stereo is nice, I'd also not spend the money on that right now. He then tried to sell me a PT Cruiser, which again was way outside my price range. I said \"Thank you for wasting my time\" and left. I have no idea what that guy was thinking. My brother sold cars for a short period of time and said that either he thought \"Psh, this guy is 20 years old, he doesn't know what he wants, I'm gonna sell him something he thinks will be a girl magnet\", or it's possible, though very unlikely, that they didn't actually have something that fit what I wanted. The dealer I eventually bought from, after telling him what I was looking for, asked \"Manual or automatic?\". I said I didn't care, and he showed me two cars that fit my criteria, test drove one of them, and drove it home. Owned that car for 13 years and 120,000 miles. reply nunez 16 hours agorootparentprevCar sales is very different from software sales. Very little margin for what's usually a one-time or few-times purchase, so you've gotta rely on volume. Pressure sales thrive on low margin. Software sales are super high margin, and big money software always requires implementation work. Long-lasting relationships are ultra important. The sales process is much slower and longer, but you get stickier customers at the end of it that keep coming back. Sales people also don't need as many deals to meet their quota...at least at first. Granted, there are still some, umm, characters, that sell software, but many of them are great people who work hard for their keep. My only gripe with the industry is sports. I just can't with all that. That said, sales folks totally expect SEs to know nothing about the sportsball; another reason why this gig is awesome! reply Taylor_OD 20 hours agorootparentprevEh.

Like, I have no problem with someone who is in the ticket flow, is conscientious about their work, tries to understand the business purpose, anticipates and asks some unanswered questions, and takes care to truly finish the work. Then, you know, sure, work your eight (or six), take your breaks, and leave it out of your brain all other times. But the other style is all-too-common: Do only what's listed in the ticket, and the laziest possible interpretation at that. If something is undefined, well, that's their problem, if they realize it, they can schedule another ticket. Don't ask questions, don't collaborate, don't do anything extra and then if pressed, say phrases like, \"Well they didn't say..\" or \"well, they didn't ask...\" Take no ownership. Those people suck. reply bongodongobob 20 hours agorootparentI completely disagree. The more you hand hold the users, the less they'll try. You have to half-ass and close some tickets and make them reopen. If they don't get any pushback or frustration from not following protocol, they'll continue to do it. Any decent manager should understand and have your back on those kind of requests. reply treesknees 20 hours agoparentprevYou're being downvoted but I mean this does work for some people. I definitely have coworkers who treat their work as purely transactional. Their goal isn't to be promoted or get frustrated at their job, it's to receive a paycheck and health insurance and get home to their families or hobbies. That's certainly a valid approach in any job scenario (not just SWE.) I'm not quite at the level you've described, but I certainly have elements of it. I've been in the same role for ~10 years and have pretty much maxed out the expected raises/promotions of the role. It's not as satisfying as something brand new, but my pay to effort ratio is pretty ideal and I can work on side projects and learn new things on my own. reply nunez 16 hours agoparentprevEasier said than done. reply hkt 21 hours agoparentprevThis is a dramatically unpleasant way to live, though. Op is asking out of a desire to have a fulfilling life and clearly isn't finding fulfilment in SWE. reply palata 20 hours agorootparentThe keywords were: \"check out mentally at the end of the day\". You can have a fulfilling life out of work. It doesn't mean that you have to be miserable at work, but it's also important to realize that \"being productive\" is not the only way to live. Those who make a fortune with software generally don't work on improving society; on the contrary they generally are bigger contributors to the problem. Whether they realize it and accept it in exchange for the cash or actually think they deserve that kind of money is a different question. reply einpoklum 20 hours agoparentprevBecause \"they\" are writing the code all wrong and crooked! reply refulgentis 21 hours agoparentprevEM = engineering manager. Re: arguing and why not just avoid it: During my brief (7 year) sojourn at one place that was not-my-company (Google), you end up with a mix of personalities, and it's very hard to convince people who believe there's a Right Way to do things that there is no Right Way, so you just sort of have to muddle through figuring out how to be productive without irritating people, or as an EM, leaving them thinking you're negligent. Conversely, theoretically, it's hard to convince people who are slopping through and rushing code to slow down. (in practice, this wasn't a problem at Google, but it's worth mentioning for completeness.) Case study: 6 person team. 1 EM who ended up doing 20% of the code, 1 me who did 60%, 2 who did 10% each, only do things when directly asked, and they couldn't find an excuse to kick the can down the road due to \"ambiguity\" that was product/design's fault, and then two who, in all seriousness, never contributed code to this year-long project: 1 who wanted OOP-to-the-max InjectedFoobarManagerFactory, another who definitely didn't want anything like that, but didn't really have an alternate proposal, they just loved explaining endlessly and authoritatively why anything else brought up was bad. (what did they do if they weren't contributing? the first would write vaguely productive \"experiments\" for other teams, that obviously wouldn't ship, in the code repo they were used to. took them 18-24 months to make their first code contribution to our actual code repo, the other wandered off to some other random project in the org. EM was new and out 3/4 of the project for new child leave) reply Ethee 21 hours agorootparentTo add to this, it feels to me like SWEs have the biggest egos as well without a related checking mechanism. In other engineering disciplines getting something wrong very often comes back to you as the engineer, in SWE it feels like there are so many abstractions people like to point fingers at instead. \"It's not my code that's the issue, its X implementation's fault\" the amount of times I've heard something similar to this is too often. reply quicklime 20 hours agorootparentYou might be right that SWEs have the biggest egos compared to other engineering disciplines. When I've worked with mechanical and electrical engineers, that was the case. But where I work now, the biggest egos are easily the people around the SWEs - especially architects and product owners. Is that not the case where you work? reply refulgentis 20 hours agorootparentprev100%. I don't know what to call it other than coddling, but there was very, very, very, little true responsibility. Safety in the herd: don't let the people who got the stuff done get too up in their heads about it, via their design had issues at the end of the day, and conversely, if I did deliver something of low quality, it was someone else's design that was the problem. All the firing BS in from mid-2022 in this industry was poorly motivated, and a lot of the initial wave was used for settling political scores, and there's a lot still there. But I hope in the long run it engenders a stronger sense of needing to have some sort of shared reality and responsibility. reply withinboredom 20 hours agorootparentprev> it's very hard to convince people who believe there's a Right Way to do things that there is no Right Way I worked with a guy who claimed they'd worked at Google (probably not you, fwiw). They were SO SURE there WAS ONE TRUE WAY, and I'm 90% sure the actual definition was \"whatever way this guy [me] wants to do it is not the TRUE WAY.\" I almost quit dealing with that guy, but I ended up wandering to some other random project in the org. Dude was whack though. I'll never forget when we hired a guy and he was saying \"if the hiring team thinks he's good enough, he's clearly not because they hired this guy [pointing at me].\" Fuck that guy.

Instead of building eCommerce sites for Fortune-50 companies, doing it for local Mom & Pop Shops... Outcome : Meh, I spent too much time looking for customers, and too few hours billing for work. The projects were just too small. It may work, if you can some how get enough small customers, but I found it really unfulfilling to have to \"cut corners\" to meet the really tiny budgets that small customers have. And working with things like some shitty junk template for Shopify or WordPress Commerce was just torture. EDIT : I also lost about $85k on a $55k project trying to do something for a small business. It was embarrassing. I took on a project that was a bit too big for me to do all alone, so I contracted a team of devs that a friend raved about... and they didn't work for me. Anyway ended up having to pay them, and just lost 6-months of time, totally embarrassed myself to the customer (who I had gotten through a friend), and in the end I ended up doing like 5x more work than I had planned and hiring a (non-cheap) friend to come in and help save the day. I don't know the advice I learned here really... other than it just flat out sucks to have things go sour when doing a side-project that you're personally on the hook for delivering. In my case, it came down to me trusting the wrong people. Really is quite valuable to know the people you are working with. 2) Building stuff outside of tech. I built a few tables and benches and such for friends in my garage. I posted a few pics online and found a buyer for an item, and like I went in thinking I was charging a fair price. Outcome : I like woodworking, so the work was fun. The downside is that these sorts of customers are a pain in the ass. Guy commissioned an \"indoor table\" and then put it outside space... and 3 months later he was mad that the finish wasn't holding up. In the end I burned a lot of time, basically had to refund the entire sale price, lost money and time trying to remedy the situation (not to mention haul the item to and from my garage shop multiple times), and just got really frustrated with humanity. Like it's one thing to do some tech work and have people trash it... it's a whole other thing to have someone take a beautifully finished indoor table and then stick it out in the rain and cold for 3 months and then be upset that the wood warped and want you to burn hours fixing it... Plus this customer was just such a pain in the ass. And you have to \"love your customers\" to get started in this sort of space, and love engaging with Social Media. 3) \"Coaching\" / Project Governance. I found some people who would have hired me to do work, but instead had hired some (cheaper) shops. Then I found a role overseeing the work and coaching them on what to look for and what to expect. Outcome : Made good hourly money, but in the end it was way too similar to my day job... only with a lot more headache. Software teams that were in India, or other places that were just the most god awful teams you could imagine. Bad quality. Bad communication. Dishonest. Shitty shitty off-shore hours. But also clients just kinda sucked. Marketing folks who would sit and listen and give praise for advice, and then disregard it all and then come back with, \"Oh thanks for your good advice last time, let's say I didn't listen to any of it and all the bad things you said would happen happened... now what do I do to save the project?\" But, of the 3 options so far, this was what paid the best. I did this a handful of times and some were OK, but most were really frustrating. 4) Angel Investor. I found some small local businesses... one in tech, the others not so much... and just got involved. Helped with stupid things like marketing sites, or setting up POS systems... whatever I could help with. Gave them a bit of seed money -- either as a loan, or purchased 10% of their business. Outcome : Lost money and time on 3 businesses, but one of the companies did OK, and I could probably live off the returns for a while if I needed to (or sell my share). It's hard to predict which companies will do well, but being an Angel Investor was nice in that you get enough control (people don't just listen to you and ignore you), and you get some hands-on work, and the returns can be pretty solid. The company that did well was just something dumb... a neighbor's friend was building a few warehouses to rent to Amazon. reply charlie0 19 hours agoparent4. would be the dream for me. It requires learning and applying a lot of things across multiple domains. The complexity and problem solving nature is very attractive. The only problem is you need a bag or 2 to actually be able to start this. Part of being an investor is you can't put all the eggs into one basket. So you need enough capital to put it into multiple baskets and be willing to lose it as part of the learning process. reply NSHkr_hn 20 hours agoprevI was working on a failing startup in Hawaii Kai, and left for Haleiwa due to a woman who was stalking and gaslighting me. Landed in a Haleiwa house and was stalked, hacked and and gaslighted by the owner’s family help. Ran into a man who engaged in state sponsored grand theft and lied to investigators, ruined my life. Witness to corruption, perjury, misconduct. Tried investigating the hacking and stalking and was met with a serious coordinated threat of murder. Was blackmailed to stay silent about the murder threat. Couldn’t work on code much more. Went homeless. Media blackout on the trial (would have been a salacious headline in Hawai’i), perhaps due to my reports of receiving the coordinated murder threat and the status of the social circle who issued it. Took the NSA’s college level codebreaker challenge and did pretty well. Bad idea. They call them spooks for a reason. Met a wealthy man here in Haleiwa who gave me side work and pushed various hard drugs on me, so I tried getting away from him. Endured criminal violence, harassment, discrediting and defamation, obstruction of justice from a judge, and more shenanigans. Tried getting back into coding. Even got a donor laptop from a nice ex Amazon employee here on hn to try to rebuild. Took another NSA codebreaker challenge while homeless and while dealing with the ongoing violence, harassment and discrediting campaign from the wealthy party with a lawyer. Couldn’t handle it. Laptop gone. Sorry to the ex Amazon guy who donated it. It was a tiny little i5/8GB, enough to participate in the NSA CTF. Met a guy into data engineering at the coffee shop who gifted me a brand new M2 MBP 24GB. Tried getting back into programming while homeless. Hasn’t worked. Gave it back to him new in box. Was being targeted yet again at the time due to being exposed homeless on a bicycle in public. Couldn’t handle it and can’t deal with the constant lack of dignity due to experiencing long term homelessness and destitution. Still homeless seven years later and in a far worse predicament. Not very optimistic about my future. Scrapping for food money. I live on a bicycle with two backpacks outdoors on public assistance for food, which helps a bit. Bicycle has irreparably broken down today; trying to find a donor replacement locally so I can make it to my gardening job for food money tomorrow. It’s bad enough to be ruined with lies while others enjoy lack of accountability. Far worse is to be discredited and met with skepticism about reports of criminal behavior.

What people like the most in a person that is down is positivity and a willingness to grow. It's hard. I know. But in the end of the day nobody really cares about all the shit that you went through. Talking about it like you do in the post above creates opportunity for people to wave it away as a lie, or something you brought upon yourself. Better leave it vague.
