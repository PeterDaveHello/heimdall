They offer a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what you’re talking about. September 25, 2023 Authors OpenAI Product , Announcements We are beginning to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT. They offer a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what you’re talking about. Voice and image give you more ways to use ChatGPT in your life. Snap a picture of a landmark while traveling and have a live conversation about what’s interesting about it. When you’re home, snap pictures of your fridge and pantry to figure out what’s for dinner (and ask follow up questions for a step by step recipe). After dinner, help your child with a math problem by taking a photo, circling the problem set, and having it share hints with both of you. We’re rolling out voice and images in ChatGPT to Plus and Enterprise users over the next two weeks. Voice is coming on iOS and Android (opt-in in your settings) and images will be available on all platforms. Speak with ChatGPT and have it talk back You can now use voice to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with your assistant. Speak with it on the go, request a bedtime story for your family, or settle a dinner table debate. Speak with ChatGPT and have it talk back 1:42 Use voice to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with your assistant. To get started with voice, head to Settings → New Features on the mobile app and opt into voice conversations. Then, tap the headphone button located in the top-right corner of the home screen and choose your preferred voice out of five different voices. The new voice capability is powered by a new text-to-speech model, capable of generating human-like audio from just text and a few seconds of sample speech. We collaborated with professional voice actors to create each of the voices. We also use Whisper, our open-source speech recognition system, to transcribe your spoken words into text. Listen to voice samples Select text Story Recipe Speech Poem Explanation Once in a tranquil woodland, there was a fluffy mama cat named Lila. One sunny day, she cuddled with her playful kitten, Milo, under the shade of an old oak tree. “Milo,” Lila began, her voice soft and gentle, “you’re going to have a new playmate soon.” Milo’s ears perked up, curious. “A new playmate?” Lila purred, “Yes, a baby sister.” Milo’s eyes widened with excitement. “A sister? Will she chase tails like I do?” Lila chuckled. “Oh, she’ll have her own quirks. You’ll teach her, won’t you?” Milo nodded eagerly, already dreaming of the adventures they’d share. Select voice Juniper Sky Cove Ember Breeze Chat about images You can now show ChatGPT one or more images. Troubleshoot why your grill won’t start, explore the contents of your fridge to plan a meal, or analyze a complex graph for work-related data. To focus on a specific part of the image, you can use the drawing tool in our mobile app. Chat about images 1:29 Show ChatGPT one or more images. To get started, tap the photo button to capture or choose an image. If you’re on iOS or Android, tap the plus button first. You can also discuss multiple images or use our drawing tool to guide your assistant. Image understanding is powered by multimodal GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These models apply their language reasoning skills to a wide range of images, such as photographs, screenshots, and documents containing both text and images. We are deploying image and voice capabilities gradually OpenAI’s goal is to build AGI that is safe and beneficial. We believe in making our tools available gradually, which allows us to make improvements and refine risk mitigations over time while also preparing everyone for more powerful systems in the future. This strategy becomes even more important with advanced models involving voice and vision. Voice The new voice technology—capable of crafting realistic synthetic voices from just a few seconds of real speech—opens doors to many creative and accessibility-focused applications. However, these capabilities also present new risks, such as the potential for malicious actors to impersonate public figures or commit fraud. This is why we are using this technology to power a specific use case—voice chat. Voice chat was created with voice actors we have directly worked with. We’re also collaborating in a similar way with others. For example, Spotify is using the power of this technology for the pilot of their Voice Translation feature, which helps podcasters expand the reach of their storytelling by translating podcasts into additional languages in the podcasters’ own voices. Image input Vision-based models also present new challenges, ranging from hallucinations about people to relying on the model’s interpretation of images in high-stakes domains. Prior to broader deployment, we tested the model with red teamers for risk in domains such as extremism and scientific proficiency, and a diverse set of alpha testers. Our research enabled us to align on a few key details for responsible usage. Making vision both useful and safe Like other ChatGPT features, vision is about assisting you with your daily life. It does that best when it can see what you see. This approach has been informed directly by our work with Be My Eyes, a free mobile app for blind and low-vision people, to understand uses and limitations. Users have told us they find it valuable to have general conversations about images that happen to contain people in the background, like if someone appears on TV while you’re trying to figure out your remote control settings. We’ve also taken technical measures to significantly limit ChatGPT’s ability to analyze and make direct statements about people since ChatGPT is not always accurate and these systems should respect individuals’ privacy. Real world usage and feedback will help us make these safeguards even better while keeping the tool useful. Transparency about model limitations Users might depend on ChatGPT for specialized topics, for example in fields like research. We are transparent about the model's limitations and discourage higher risk use cases without proper verification. Furthermore, the model is proficient at transcribing English text but performs poorly with some other languages, especially those with non-roman script. We advise our non-English users against using ChatGPT for this purpose. You can read more about our approach to safety and our work with Be My Eyes in the system card for image input. We will be expanding access Plus and Enterprise users will get to experience voice and images in the next two weeks. We’re excited to roll out these capabilities to other groups of users, including developers, soon after.

This demo is really underwhelming to me because of the multi-second latency between the query and response, just like every other lame voice assistant. It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way! I have a local demo using Llama 2 that responds in about half a second and it feels like talking to an actual person instead of like Siri or something.I really should package it up so people can try it. The one problem that makes it a little unnatural is that determining when the user is done talking is tough. What&#x27;s needed is a speech conversation turn-taking dataset and model; that&#x27;s missing from off the shelf speech recognition systems. But it should be trivial for a company like OpenAI to build. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d work on right now if I was there, because truly natural voice conversations are going to unlock a whole new set of users and use cases for these models. reply TheEzEzz 15 hours agoparentCompletely agree, latency is key for unlocking great voice experiences. Here&#x27;s a quick demo I&#x27;m working on for voice ordering https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WfvLIEHwiyoTotal end-to-end latency is a few hundred milliseconds: starting from speech to text, to the LLM, then to a POS to validate the SKU (no hallucinations are possible!), and finally back to generated speech. The latency is starting to feel really natural. Building out a general system to achieve this low-latency will I think end up being a big unlock for enabling diverse applications. reply TheEzEzz 12 hours agorootparentSince this is getting a bit of interest, here&#x27;s one more demo of this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cvKUa5JpRp4 This demo shows even lower latency, plus the ability to handle very large menus with lots of complicated sub-options (this restaurant has over a billion option combinations to order a coffee). The latency is negative in some places, meaning the system finishes predicting before I finish speaking. reply arcticfox 12 hours agorootparentHoly cow. That&#x27;s better than the average human drive-through attendant. reply jonplackett 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is cool. But I want to see how it handles you going back one and tweaking it. reply armini 8 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;ve built something similar that allows you to tweak&#x2F;update notes & reminders https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qwerki.com&#x2F; (private beta) here&#x27;s the video demo https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;2hpBTxjplIE we&#x27;ve since moved to training our own LLAMA as it&#x27;s more responsive & we have better reliability. reply cyrux004 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is pretty good. Do you think running models locally will be able to achieve performance (getting task done successfully) compared to cloud based ones.i am assuming for context of a drive through scenario it should be ok but more complex systems might need external infromation reply TheEzEzz 15 hours agorootparentDefinitely depends on the application, agreed. The more open ended the application the more dependent it is on larger LLMs (and other systems) that don&#x27;t easily fit on edge. At the same time, progress is happening that is increasing the size of LLM that can be ran on edge. I imagine we end up in a hybrid world for many applications, where local models take a first pass (and also handle speech transcription) and only small requests are made to big cloud-based models as needed. reply wordpad25 14 hours agorootparentCan you share the source code? What did you do to improve the latency? reply TheEzEzz 13 hours agorootparentLots of work around speculative decoding, optimizing across the ASR->LLM->TTS interfaces, fine-tuning smaller models while maintaining accuracy (lots of investment here), good old fashioned engineering around managing requests to the GPU, etc. We&#x27;re considering commercializing this so I can&#x27;t open source just yet, but if we end up not selling it I&#x27;ll definitely think about opening it up. reply 7_hours_ago 1 hour agorootparentCan you at least share the stack that you&#x27;re using in building this? What kind of business model are you considering in commercializing it? replynelox 14 hours agorootparentprevThe voice does not seem to be able to pronounce the L in “else”. What’s happening there? reply TheEzEzz 13 hours agorootparentGood question. Off the shelf TTS systems tend to enunciate every phoneme more like a radio talk show host rather than a regular person, which I find a bit off putting. I&#x27;ve been playing around with trying to get the voice to be more colloquial&#x2F;casual. But I haven&#x27;t gotten it to really sound natural yet. reply g0atbutt 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is a very slick demo. Nice job! reply TheEzEzz 12 hours agorootparentThanks! It&#x27;s a lot of fun building with these new models and recent AI approaches. reply arktiso 14 hours agorootparentprevWow, the latency on requests feels great!! I’m really curious: is this running entirely with Python? reply TheEzEzz 13 hours agorootparent100% Python but with a good deal of multiprocessing, speculative decoding, etc. As we move to production we can probably shave another 100ms off by moving over to a compiled system, but Python is great for rapid iteration. reply mach1ne 14 hours agorootparentprevManna v0.7 reply kortex 14 hours agorootparentContext for the unaware: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Manna_(novel) reply simian1983 13 hours agorootparentprevThat demo is pretty slick. What happens when you go totally off book? Like, ask it to recite the numbers of pi? Or if you become abusive? Will it call the cops? reply TheEzEzz 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s trained to ignore everything else. That way background conversations are ignored as well (like your kids talking in the back of the car while you order). reply edge17 6 hours agorootparentHow do you train for this? reply yarone 10 hours agorootparentprevNice work, very cool! reply furyofantares 16 hours agoparentprev> This demo is really underwhelming to me because of the multi-second latency between the query and response, just like every other lame voice assistant.Yep - it needs to be ready as soon as I&#x27;m done talking and I need to be able to interrupt it. If those things can be done then it can also start tentatively talking if I pause and immediately stop if I continue.I don&#x27;t want to have to think about how to structure the interaction in terms of explicit call&#x2F;response chain, nor do I want to have to be super careful to always be talking until I&#x27;ve finished my thought to prevent it from doing its thing at the wrong time. reply wkat4242 15 hours agorootparentThe interruption is an important point yeah. It&#x27;s so annoying when Siri misunderstands again and starts rattling off a whole host of options. And keeps getting stuck in a loop if you don&#x27;t respond.In fact I&#x27;m really surprised these assistants are still as crap as they are. Totally scripted, zero AI. It seems low hanging fruit to implement an LLM but none of the big three have done so. Not even sure about the fringe ones like Cortana and Bixby reply og_kalu 12 hours agorootparentI mean Microsoft is planning to. Rolling out as soon as tomorrow.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5rEZGSFgZVY reply wkat4242 5 hours agorootparentWindows 11 copilot is not really the same thing though. They don&#x27;t do something like homepods you can have around your house. reply singularity2001 4 hours agorootparentprevThe CallAnnie demo allows interruption and its such a leap forward compared to Siri reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah when I was developing it, it quickly became apparent that I needed to be able to interrupt it. So I implemented that. Pretty easy to implement actually. Much harder would be to have the model interrupt the human. But I think it is actually desirable for natural conversation, so I do think a turn-taking model should be able to signal the LLM to interrupt the human. reply dotancohen 11 hours agoparentprevnext [–]> determining when the user is done talking is tough.Sometimes that task is tough for the speaker too, not just the listener. Courteous interruptions or the lack thereof might be a shibboleth for determining when we are speaking to an AI. reply kimburgess 10 hours agorootparentFrom prior experience, courteous interruption is a skill that a lot of humans find challenging at times too (myself included). reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentprevYes interruptions are key, both ways. Having the user interrupt the bot is easy, but to have the bot interrupt the human will again require a model to predict when that should happen. But I do believe it is desirable for natural conversation. reply rayuela 17 hours agoparentprevCan you share a github link to this? Where are you reducing the latency? Are you processing the raw audio to text? In my experience ChatGPT generation time is much faster than local Lllama unless you&#x27;re using something potato like a 7B model. reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentUnfortunately it has a really high \"works on my machine\" factor. I&#x27;m using Llama2-chat-13B via mlc-llm + whisper-streaming + coqui TTS. I just have a bunch of hardcoded paths and these projects tend to be a real pain to set up, so figuring out a nice way to package it up with its dependencies in a portable way is the hard part.I&#x27;m mostly using llama2 because I wanted it to work entirely offline, not because it&#x27;s necessarily faster, although it is quite fast with mlc-llm. Calling out to GPT-4 is something I&#x27;d like to add. I think the right thing is actually to have the local model generate the first few words (even filler words sometimes maybe) and then switch to the GPT-4 answer whenever it comes back. reply jonplackett 12 hours agoparentprevI wonder when computers will start taking our intonation into account too. That would really help with understanding the end of a phrase. And there’s SO MUCH information in intonation that doesn’t exist in pure text. Any AI that doesn’t understand that part of language will always still be kinda dumb, however clever they are. reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right. Ultimately the only way this will really work is as an end-to-end model. Text will only get you so far. We could approximate it now with screenplay-like emotion annotations on text, which LLMs should both easily understand and be able to produce themselves (though you&#x27;d have to train a new speech recognition system to produce them). But end-to-end will be required eventually to reach human level fluency. reply hk__2 12 hours agorootparentprevDon’t they do it already? There are a lot of languages where intonation is absolutely necessary to distinguish between some words, so I would be surprised that this not already taken into account by the major voice assistants. reply bobsmooth 10 hours agorootparentIn English, intonation changes the meaning of the word but not the word itself. From what I understand, in tonal languages tone changes the whole word. I don&#x27;t think ML understands that difference yet. reply fragmede 8 hours agorootparentYeah they do. I was able to get ChatGPT-4 to transcribe 我哥哥高過他的哥哥, which says that they can. I did have to set the app to Chinese, and the original didn&#x27;t work so I had to modify what I said slightly.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;ZT86psPxY&#x2F;Roughly translated, my older brother is taller than that other guy&#x27;s older brother. reply modeless 7 hours agorootparentOf course speech recognition works for Chinese. What it doesn&#x27;t do is transcribe intonation and prosody in non-tonal languages. It&#x27;s not even clear how one would transcribe such a thing as I&#x27;m not aware of a standard notation. replydsp_person 15 hours agoparentprevAlso curious to hear about your setup. Using whisper too? When I was experimenting with it there was still a lot of annoyance about hallucinations and I was hard coding some \"if last phrase is &#x27;thanks for watching&#x27;, ignore last phrase\"I was just googling a bit to see what&#x27;s out there now for whisper&#x2F;llama combos and came across this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yacineMTB&#x2F;talkThere&#x27;s a demo linked on the github page that seems relatively fast at responding conversationally, but still maybe 1-2 seconds at times. Impressive it&#x27;s entirely offline. reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentLol yeah the hallucinations are a huge problem. Likely solvable, I think there are probably some bugs in various whisper implementations that are making the problem worse than it should be. I haven&#x27;t really dug in on that yet though. I was hoping I could switch to a different STT model more designed for real time like Meta&#x27;s SeamlessM4T but it&#x27;s still under a non-commercial license and I did have an idea that I might want to try making a product sometime. I did see that yacine made that version but I haven&#x27;t tried it so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to mine. reply QuantumG 7 hours agorootparentprevTurn the volume on your microphone down and watch as Whisper just starts SCREAMING. reply jimmytucson 15 hours agoparentprev> It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way!Is there any extra work OpenAI’s product might be doing contributing to this latency that yours isn’t? Considering the scale they operate at and any reputational risks to their brand? reply modeless 6 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re suggesting that OpenAI&#x27;s morality filters are responsible for a significant part of their voice response latency, then no. I think that&#x27;s unlikely to be a relevant factor. reply og_kalu 14 hours agoparentprevHere&#x27;s something with very little latency. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bland.ai&#x2F; reply pmarreck 10 hours agoparentprevDo you have a rough design outline of what you built? I feel like we&#x27;re on the cusp of something like this and it sounds amazing. reply modeless 6 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m using Llama2-chat-13B via mlc-llm @ 4bit quantization + whisper-streaming + coqui TTS, all running simultaneously on one 4090 in real time.It didn&#x27;t take long to prototype. Polishing and shipping it to non-expert users would take much longer than I&#x27;ve spent on it so far. I&#x27;d have to test for and solve a ton of installation problems, find better workarounds for whisper-streaming&#x27;s hallucination issues, improve the heuristics for controlling when to start and stop talking, tweak the prompts to improve the suitability of the LLM responses for speech, fixup the LLM context when the LLM&#x27;s speech is interrupted, probably port the whole thing to Windows for broader reach in the installed base of 4090s, possibly introduce a low-memory mode that can support 12GB GPUs that are much more common, document the requirements and installation process, and figure out hosting for the ginormous download it would be. I&#x27;d estimate at least 10x the effort I&#x27;ve spent so far on the prototype before I&#x27;d really be satisfied with the result.I&#x27;d honestly love to do all that work. I&#x27;ve been prioritizing other projects because I judged that it was so obvious as a next step that someone else was probably working on the same thing with a lot more resources and would release before I could finish as a solo dev. But maybe I&#x27;m wrong... reply yieldcrv 14 hours agoparentprevall it has to do is add a random selection of \"uhms\" and \"ahhs\" and \"mmm\" reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentActually I do think this is a good idea. For best latency there should be multiple LLMs involved, a fast one to generate the first few words and then GPT-4 or similar for the rest of the response. In the case that the fast model is unsure, it could absolutely generate filler words while it waits for the big model to return the actual answer. I guess that&#x27;s pretty much how humans use filler words too! reply dragonwriter 14 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, Bark is probably way too slow to use for the TTS portion given the latency concerns or that would be covered. reply TOMDM 21 hours agoprevOkay the bike example is cute and impressive, but the human interaction seems to be obfuscating the potentially bigger application.With a few tweaks this is a general purpose solver for robotics planning. There are still a few hard problems between this and a working solution, but it is one of hard problems solved.Will we be seeing general purpose robots performing simple labor powered by chatgpt within the next half decade? reply usaar333 19 hours agoparentThat bike example seemed a mix of underwhelming (for being the demo video) and even confusing.1. It&#x27;s not smart enough to recognize from the initial image this is a bolt style seat lock (which a human can).2. The manual is not shown to the viewer, so I can&#x27;t infer how the model knows this is a 4mm bolt (or if it is just guessing given that&#x27;s the most likely one).3. I don&#x27;t understand how it can know the toolbox is using metric allen wrenches.Additionally is this just the same vision model that exists in bing chat? reply biot 15 hours agorootparentThe bike shown in the first image is Specialized Sirrus X. You can make out from the image of the manual that it says \"spacer&#x2F;axle&#x2F;bolt specifications\". Searching for this yields the following Specialized bike manual which is similar: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manualslib.com&#x2F;manual&#x2F;1974494&#x2F;Specialized-Epic-E... -- there are some notable differences, but the Specialized Sirrus X manuals that are online aren&#x27;t in the same style.The prior page (8) shows \"SEAT COLLAR 4mm HEX\" and, based on looking up seat collar in an image search, the part in question matches.In terms of the toolbox, note that it only identified the location of the Allen wrench set. The advice was just \"Within that set, find the 4 mm Allen (Hex) key\". Had they replied with \"I don&#x27;t see any sizes in mm\", the conversation could&#x27;ve continued with \"Your Allen keys might be using SAE sizing. A compatible size will be 5&#x2F;32, do you see that in your set?\" reply freetime2 9 hours agorootparentIt bugged me that they made no mention of torque. The manual is really clear on that part with a big warning:> WARNING! Correct tightening force on fasteners (nuts, bolts, screws) on your bicycle is important for your safety. If too little force is applied, the fastener may not hold securely. If too much force is applied, the fastener can strip threads, stretch, deform or break. Either way, incorrect tightening force can result in component failure, which can cause you to lose control and fall. Where indicated, ensure that each bolt is torqued to specification. The following is a summary of torque specifications in this manual...The seat collar also probably has the max torque printed on it.When they asked if they had the right tool, I would have preferred to see an answer along the lines of \"ideally you should be using a torque wrench. You can use the wrench you have currently, but be careful not to over tighten.\" reply somecallitblues 6 hours agorootparentThe seat collar also probably has the max torque printed on it.

Neither of these ever work. “Siri&#x2F; ok google add the next gas station on the route” or “take me to the Chinese restaurant in Hoboken” seem like very obvious features for a voice assistant with a map program.The other is why can I tell Siri to bring up the Wikipedia page for George Washington but I can’t have Siri read it to me?

LLMs would be able to trivially solve problems that the best voice assistants today cannot handle.Then again none of the current assistants can handle all that much. \"Send Alex P a meeting invite tomorrow for a playdate at the Zoo, he&#x27;s from out of town so include the Zoo&#x27;s full address in the invite\".\"Find the next mutual free slot on the team&#x27;s calendar and send out an invite for a zoom meeting at that time\".These are all things that voice assistants should have been doing a decade ago, but I presume they&#x27;d have required too much one off investment.Give an LLM proper API access and train it on some example code, and these problems are easy for it to solve. Heck I bet if you do enough specialized training you could get one of the tiny simple LLMs to do it. reply throeaaysn 18 hours agorootparentprevAlexa is supposedly adding \"human-like voice\" soon, which I can only assume \"LLMs with plugins\" reply archon 20 hours agorootparentprevAgreed.

Fact checking gets you only so far. You need critical thinking. It&#x27;s okay to \"learn\" wrong facts from time to time as long as you are willing to be critical and throw the ideas away if they turn out to be wrong. I think this Popperian view is much more useful than living with the idea that you can only accept information that is provably true. Life is too short to verify every fact. Most things outside programming are not even verifiable anyway. By the time that Steve Jobs would have \"verified\" that the iPhone was certainly a good idea to pursue, Apple might have been bankrupt. Or in the old days, by the time you have verified that there is a tiger in the bush, it has already eaten you. reply cmiles74 20 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a lot of truth in this comment and a lot that I wholeheartedly agree with.When I spend time on something that turns out to be incorrect, I would prefer it to be because of choice I made instead of some random choice made by an LLM. Maybe the author is someone I&#x27;m interested in, maybe there&#x27;s value in understanding other sides of the issue, etc. When I learn something erroneous from an LLM, all I know is that the LLM told me. reply DharmaPolice 18 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is far more serious with ChatGPT&#x2F;similar models because things that are laughably untrue are delivered exactly the same as something that&#x27;s solidly true. When doing a normal search I can make some assessment on the quality of the source and the likelihood the source is wrong.People should be able \"throw the ideas away if they turn out to be wrong\" but the problem is these ideas unconsciously or not help build your model of the world. Once you find out something isn&#x27;t true it&#x27;s hard to unpick your mental model of the world. reply huijzer 13 hours agorootparent> Once you find out something isn&#x27;t true it&#x27;s hard to unpick your mental model of the world.Intuitively, I would think the same, but a book about education research that I read and my own experience taught me that new information is surprisingly easy to unlearn. It’s probably because new information sits at the edges of your neural networks and do not yet provide a foundation for other knowledge. This will only happen if the knowledge stands the test of time (which is exactly how it should be according to Popper). If a counterexample is found, then the information can easily be discarded since it’s not foundational anyway and the brain learns the counterexample too (the brain is very good in remembering surprising things). reply steve_adams_86 20 hours agorootparentprevI just verify the information I need. I find it useful as a sort of search engine for solutions. Like, how could I use generators as hierarchical state machines? Are there other approaches that would work? What are some issues with these solutions? Etc. By the end I have enough information to begin searching the web for comparisons, other solutions, and so on.The benefit is that I got a quick look at various solutions and quickly satisfied a curiosity, and decided if I’m interested in the concept or not. Without AI, I might just leave the idea alone or spend too much time figuring it out. Or perhaps never quite figure out the terms of what I’m trying to discover, as it’s good at connecting dots when you have an idea with some missing pieces.I wouldn’t use it for a conversation about things as others are describing. I need a way to verify its output at any time. I find that idea bizarre. Just chatting with a hallucinating machine.

It&#x27;s why the love for driving is so strong in the US. Don&#x27;t walk or ride, drive.Once I was walking back from the grocer in Florida with 4 shopping bags, and people pulled over and asked if my car had broken down and if I needed a ride, people were stunned...I was walking for exercise and for the environment...and I was stunned.More evidence of this trend can be seen in the products and marketing being produced:Do you need to write a wedding speech? Click here.Do you need to go get something from the store? get your fat ass in the car and drive, better yet, get a car that drives for you? Better than this, we&#x27;ll deliver it with a drone...don&#x27;t move a muscle.Don&#x27;t want to do your homework? Here...Want to produce art? Please enter your prompt...Want to lose weight?

We&#x27;ll generate the facts you need. reply gtowey 15 hours agorootparentI agree with this, but I think there is a deeper level which explains this. And that is convenience is a product. The thing that truly defines how corporations in America have shaped our culture is that everything is turned into a way to sell you something. reply uoaei 19 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve also identified convenience as a core factor. Another dynamic at play is this:As convenience in a domain becomes ubiquitous or at least expected among consumers, they quickly readjust their evaluation of \"having time for X\" around the new expectation of the convenient service, treating all alternatives as positive opportunity cost. This would explain a lot of those folks who are upset when it&#x27;s suggested that they don&#x27;t need Amazon, Instacart, etc. in their lives if they are to do something about their contributions to mass labor exploitation.Of course these conveniences quickly become ubiquitous in large economies with a glut of disposable income, which encourages VCs to dump money into these enterprises so they&#x27;re first to market, and also to encourage the public to believe that the future is already here and there&#x27;s no reason to worry about backsliding or sustainability of the business model. Yet in every single case we see prices eventually rise, laborers squeezed, etc. A critical mass of people haven&#x27;t yet acknowledged this inevitability, in no small part due to this fixation on convenience at the expense of more objective, reasoned understandings (read: post-truth mindset). reply NikolaNovak 19 hours agorootparentprevThis is a fairly perpetual discussion, but I&#x27;ll go for another round:I feel like using LLM today is like using search 15 years ago - you get a feel for getting results you want.I&#x27;d never use chatGPT for anything that&#x27;s even remotely obscure, controversial, or niche.But through all my double-checking, I&#x27;ve had phenomenal success rate in getting useful, readable, valid responses to well-covered &#x2F; documented topics such as introductory french, introductory music theory, well-covered & non-controversial history and science.I&#x27;d love to see the example you experienced; if I ask chatGPT \"tell me about Toronto, Canada\", my expectation would be to get high accuracy. If I asked it \"Was Hum, Croatia, part of the Istrian liberation movement in the seventies\", I&#x27;d have far less confidence - it&#x27;s a leading question, on a less covered topic, introducing inaccuracies in the prompt.My point is - for a 3 hour drive to cottage, I&#x27;m OK with something that&#x27;s only 95% accurate on easy topics! I&#x27;d get no better from my spouse or best friend if they made it on the same drive :). My life will not depend on it, I&#x27;ll have an educationally good time and miles will pass faster :).(also, these conversations always seem to end in suffocatingly self-righteous \"I don&#x27;t know how others can live in this post-fact free world of ignorance\", but that has a LOT of assumptions and, ironically, non-factual bias in it as well) reply TerrifiedMouse 13 hours agorootparent> I feel like using LLM today is like using search 15 years ago - you get a feel for getting results you want.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite the same.With search results, aka web sites, you can compare between them and get a \"majority opinion\" if you have doubts - it doesn&#x27;t guarantee correctness but it does improve the odds.Some sites are also more reputable and reliable than others - e.g. if the information is from Reuters, a university&#x27;s courseware, official government agencies, ... etc. it&#x27;s probably correct.With LLMs you get one answer and that&#x27;s it - although some like Bard provide alternate drafts but they are all from the same source and can all be hallucinations ... reply og_kalu 11 hours agorootparent>although some like Bard provide alternate drafts but they are all from the same source and can all be hallucinations ...Yes and no.

This is my experience also. Your point about \"well covered & non-controversial\" is spot on. I know not to expect great results when asking about topics that have very little coverage. To be honest I wouldn&#x27;t expect to go to an arbitrary human and get solid answers on a little covered topic, unless that person just happened to be topic expert. There is so much value in having the basics to intermediate levels of topics covered in a reliable way.

They are about synthesizing new content and insights based on the model and inputs.Rather than asking it about facts, I find it useful to derive new insights.For example: \"Tell me 5 topics about databases that might make it to the front page of hacker news.\" It can generate an interesting list. That is much more like the example they provided in the article, synthesizing a bed time story is not factual.Also, \"write me some python code to do x\" where x is based on libraries that were well documented before 2022 also has similarly creative results in my experience. reply xnorswap 21 hours agorootparentprev> how you can talk to something that doesn&#x27;t provide factual information and just take it at face valueLike talking to most people you mean? reply philipwhiuk 21 hours agorootparentWhen OpenAI buys me a drink at the bar in exchange for the rubbish it produces, I might have a more favourable view. reply ilaksh 20 hours agorootparentAs soon as they release the API, we can build an AI \"bartender\".

I like to ask GPT-4 questions within my area of expertise, because I&#x27;m able to instantly and instinctively - read: effortlessly - judge how much to trust any given reply. It&#x27;s very useful this way, because rating an answer in your own field takes much less work than coming up with it on your own. reply graemep 20 hours agorootparentprevNo individual is \"most people\". Most of the time I spend talking to people in real life is with people whose professional expertise, hobbies, and other sources of knowledge I know at least roughly. I have an idea how good they are at evaluating what they know and how honest they and whether they are prone to wishful thinking. reply bilsbie 20 hours agorootparentprev> I still don&#x27;t understand how you can talk to something that doesn&#x27;t provide factual information and just take it at face value?All human interactions from all of history called and they … reply mmahemoff 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;re using GPT-4 ($)? I find a lot of the criticisms about hallucination come from users who aren&#x27;t, and my experience with GPT-4 is it&#x27;s far less likely to make stuff up. Does it know all the answers, certainly not, but it&#x27;s self-aware enough to say sorry I don&#x27;t know instead of making a wild guess. reply steve_adams_86 20 hours agorootparentYou can also prompt it to hold back if it doesn’t know, which seems to make a difference. It’s part of my default prompt, and since I added it I haven’t had any overt hallucinations. Definitely invalid code, but not due to crazy errors. Just syntax and inconsistent naming mostly.I verify just about everything that I ask it, so it isn’t just a general sense of improvement. reply elicksaur 20 hours agorootparentprevWhy would anyone pay for something if the free trial doesn’t work? “Hey, you know how we gave you a product that doesn’t quit work as you expect and is super frustrating? Just pay us money, and we’ll give you the same product, but it just works. Just trust us!” reply sacred_numbers 19 hours agorootparentGPT-4 is not the same product. I know it seems like it due to the way they position 3.5 and 4 on the same page, but they are really quite separate things. When I signed up for ChatGPT plus I didn&#x27;t even bother using 3.5 because I knew it would be inferior. I still have only used it a handful of times. GPT-4 is just so much farther ahead that using 3.5 is just a waste of time. reply elicksaur 18 hours agorootparentWould you mind sharing some threads where you thought ChatGPT was useful? These discussions always feel like I’m living on a different planet with a different implementation of large language models than others who claim they’re great. The problems I run into seem to stem from the fundamental nature of this class of products. reply LouisSayers 8 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s a convo I had yesterday when thinking about how to print a Binary Search Tree.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;338e7397-0201-44f4-a2c3-75b733...I use ChatGPT for all sorts of things - looking into visas for countries, coding, reverse engineering companies from job descriptions, brainstorming etc etc.It saves a lot of time and gives way more value than what you pay for it. reply michaelt 17 hours agorootparentprevThe usefulness of ChatGPT is a bit situational, in my experience. But in the right situations it can be pretty powerful.Take a look at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;41bdb053-facd-448b-b446-1ba1f1... for example. reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparentA great example. Here&#x27;s a similar one from me: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.typingmind.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d2000ffc-a1bf-4b71-b59d-c....Context: had a bunch of photos and videos I wanted to share with a colleague, without uploading them to any cloud. I asked GPT-4 to write me a trivial single-page gallery that doesn&#x27;t look like crap, feeding it the output of `ls -l` on the media directory, got it on first shot, copy-pasted and uploaded the whole bundle to a personal server - all in few minutes. It took maybe 15 minutes from the idea of doing it first occurring to me, to a private link I could share.I have plenty more of those touching C++, Emacs Lisp, Python, generating vCARD and iCalendar files out of blobs of hastily-retyped or copy-pasted text, etc. The common thread here is: one-off, ad-hoc requests, usually underspecified. GPT-4 is quite good at being a fully generic tool for one-off jobs. This is something that never existed before, except in form of delegating a task to another human. reply astrange 12 hours agorootparentprevI agree that none of the problems people have mentioned above happen with GPT4.It used to be more reliable when web browsing worked, but it&#x27;s still pretty reliable. replyjocaal 20 hours agorootparentprev> ...talk to something that doesn&#x27;t provide factual information and...Ah yes, I dont understand how to talk to people either! reply bamboozled 20 hours agorootparentI always thought a better future would be full of more and more distilled, accurate, useful knowledge and truthful people to promote that.Comments like yours make me think that no one cares about this...and judging by a lot of the other comments, I guess they don&#x27;t.Probably going to be people, wading through a sea of AI generated shit, and the individual is supposed to just forever \"apply critical thinking\" to it all. Even a call from ones spouse could be fake, and you&#x27;ll just have to apply critical thinking or whatever to workout if you were scammed or not. reply astrange 12 hours agorootparentThere aren&#x27;t any real world sources of truth you can avoid applying critical thinking to. Much published research is false, and when it isn&#x27;t, you need to know when it&#x27;s expired or what context it&#x27;s valid in. reply ChatGTP 9 hours agorootparentBut do we need 9999999x the amount of information to critically be thinking about, is this going to be helpful ? reply nh23423fefe 20 hours agorootparentprevBecause it doesn&#x27;t always make up stuff. Because I&#x27;m a human and can ask for more information. I don&#x27;t want an encyclopedia on a podcast. I want to \"talk\" to someone about stuff. Not have an enumerated list of truths firehosed at me. reply londons_explore 20 hours agorootparentprevPay for the Plus version.Then it makes stuff up far less frequently.If the next version has the same step up in performance, I will no longer consider inaccuracy an issue - even the best books have mistakes in them, they just need to be infrequent enough. reply nerdbert 18 hours agorootparent> Pay for the Plus version.> Then it makes stuff up far less frequently.Now there&#x27;s a business model for a ChatGPT-like service.$1&#x2F;month: Almost always wrong$10&#x2F;month: 50&#x2F;50 chance of being right or wrong$100&#x2F;month: right 95% of the time reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparentYou make it sound like business shenanigans, but the truth is, it&#x27;s a natural fit for now, as performance of LLMs improves with their size, but costs of training (up-front investment) and inference (marginal, per-query) also go up. reply FooBarWidget 13 hours agorootparentprevA human driving buddy can make up a lot of stuff too. Have an interesting conversation but don&#x27;t take it too seriously. If you&#x27;re really researching something serious then take a mental note to double check things later, pretend as if you&#x27;re talking to a semi-reliable human who knows a lot but occasionally makes mistakes. reply umanwizard 20 hours agorootparentprevAre you using 3.5 or 4? reply jgalt212 21 hours agorootparentprevI assume you have never heard of podcasts. reply subw00f 21 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sure one can talk to their podcasts, but I would be worried if they ever answered me back. reply catchnear4321 21 hours agorootparentprevyou can ask podcasts questions? and they answer you? reply jgalt212 16 hours agorootparentno, but they don&#x27;t get the answer wrong 20% of the time and give off 100% correctness vibes. reply catchnear4321 16 hours agorootparentneither does a tuba.why be mad at a hammer if you hit your thumb with it? reply olddustytrail 15 hours agorootparentprevNo, generally podcasts are far worse than that... replyidopmstuff 20 hours agoparentprevIt increasingly feels to me like building any kind of general-use AI tool or app is a bad choice. I see two viable AI business models:1. Domain-specific AI - Training an AI model on highly technical and specific topics that general-purpose AI models don&#x27;t excel at.2. Integration - If you&#x27;re going to build on an existing AI model, don&#x27;t focus on adding more capabilities. Instead, focus on integrating it into companies&#x27; and users&#x27; existing workflows. Use it to automate internal processes and connect systems in ways that weren&#x27;t previously possible. This adds a lot of value and isn&#x27;t something that companies developing AI models are liable to do themselves.The two will often go hand-in-hand. reply Renaud 19 hours agorootparent> building any kind of general-use AI tool or app is a bad choiceMaybe not if you rely on models that can be ran locally.OpenAI is big now, and will probably stay big, but with hardware acceleration, AI-anything will become ubiquitous and OpenAI won’t be able to control a domain that’s probably going to be as wide as what computing is already today.The shape of what’s coming is hard to imagine now. I feel like the kid I was when I got my first 8-bit computer in the eighties: I knew it was going to change the world, but I had little idea how far, wide and fast it would be. reply idopmstuff 11 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of OS models being released - there&#x27;s going to be a steadily increasing quantity + quality of models you can run locally.

Companies tend to build their own products and use third party software for internal tools.Just look at Salesforce AppExchange - it&#x27;s a marketplace of software built on top of Salesforce, a large chunk of which serves to integrate other systems with Salesforce. LLMs open up the ability to build new types of integrations and to provide a much friendlier UI to non-developers who need to work on integrating things or dealing with data that exists in different places. reply whimsicalism 15 hours agorootparentprev> 1.

The app already features voice input. That still translates voice into text before sending, but it works so well that you basically never need to check or correct anything. Rather, you might have already been asking yourself why it doesn&#x27;t reply back with a voice already.And the ability ingest images was a highlight and all the hype of the GPT-4 announcement back in March: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;gpt-4 reply mistrial9 19 hours agorootparentone of the original training sets for the BERT series is called &#x27;BookCorpus&#x27;, accumulated by regular grad students for Natural Language Processing science. Part of the content was specifically and exactly purposed to \"align\" movies and video with written text. That is partly why it contains several thousand teen romance novels and ordinary paperback-style story telling content. What else is in there? \"inquiring minds want to know\" reply skissane 13 hours agoparentprev> This announcement seem to have killed so many startups that were trying to do multi-modal on top of ChatGPT.Rather than die, why not just pivot to doing multi-modal on top of Llama 2 or some open source model or whatever? It wouldn’t be a huge changeA lot of businesses&#x2F;governments&#x2F;etc can’t use OpenAI due to their own policies that prohibit sending their data to third party services.

I was pitching something I like better earlier this year (I still think they’re missing a few key things), but with backing from roughly YC, Meta, and God, and a pretty clear understanding that robustness goes up a lot faster than capability goes down?I wouldn’t count out focused, revenue-oriented players with Meta’s shit in their pocket out just yet. reply moneywoes 19 hours agorootparentwow Elto seems to kill many of the incumbents in this nichewhat do you think they’re missing? i was trying to build a diaper but it would be impossible to compete with these guys reply amelius 21 hours agoparentprev\"Don&#x27;t build your castle in someone else&#x27;s kingdom.\" reply nunobrito 21 hours agoparentprevIt already replaced search engines. So much easier to write the question and explore the answers until it is solved. reply mmahemoff 21 hours agorootparentTook me a while to realise I can just type search queries into ChatGPT. e.g. simply \"london bridge history\" or whatever into the chat and not only get a complete answer, but I can ask it follow-up questions. And it&#x27;s also personalised for the kinds of responses I want, thanks to the custom instructions setting.ChatGPT is my primary search engine now. (I just wish it would accept a URL query parameter so it could be launched straight from the browser address bar.) reply elicksaur 20 hours agorootparentTrying that example, I’d much prefer just going to the Wikipedia page on London Bridge than trying to guess what phrases ChatGPT will respond well to in order to elicit more info. It’s initial response for me didn’t even mention one of the most interesting facts that people lived and worked on the bridge. reply nunobrito 20 hours agorootparentprevYMMV. For my case on software development, I don&#x27;t even look on stackoverflow anymore.Just type the tech question, start refining into what is needed and get a snippet of code tailored for what is needed. What previously would take 30 to 60 minutes of research and testing is now less than a couple of minutes. reply reitanqild 20 hours agorootparentAnd I don&#x27;t have to wade through Stack Overflow and see all the times mods and others have tried to or succeeded in closing down very useful questions. reply devjab 19 hours agorootparentprevI know there are a lot of google programmers out there, but was using search engines for programming ever a good idea? Don’t get me wrong, I’ll look up how to do absolutely simple things every day but I basically always look in the official documentation.Which may be why I’ve been very underwhelmed by GPT so far. It’s not terrible at programming, and it’s certainly better than what I can find on Google, but it’s not better than simply looking up how things work. I’m really curious as to why it hasn’t put a more heavy weight on official documentation for its answers, they must’ve scraped that a long with all the other stuff, yet it’ll give you absolutely horrible suggestions when the real answer must be in its dataset. Maybe that would be weird for less common things, but it’s so terrible at JavaScript that it might even be able to write some of those StackOverflow answers if we’re being satirical, and the entire documentation for that would’ve been very easy to flag as important. reply midasz 15 hours agorootparentYes there are and it&#x27;s infuriating. Colleague of mine had problems with integrating some code into an app that was built on a newer version of a framework because \"there aren&#x27;t a lot of examples yet\". One web search and I found the frameworks own migration guide detailing the exact differences that would need to be accounted for. reply aduitsis 20 hours agorootparentprevFortunately it&#x27;s not like StackOverflow has been used as training data for LLMs, right? reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparentWell, yes. Point is, GPT-4 read the entire StackOverflow and then some, comprehended it, and now is a better interface to it, more specific and free of all the bullshit that&#x27;s part of the regular web. reply layer8 21 hours agorootparentprevThis is funny, because I find it much less cumbersome to type a few search terms into a search engine and explore the links it spits out. reply mrits 20 hours agorootparentIt depends on the subject but search engines are on the decline. With so many fake website written by AI I can only see it get worse.The most extreme I can think of is when I want to find when a show comes out and I have to read 10 paragraphs from 5 different sites to realize no one knows. reply layer8 20 hours agorootparent> The most extreme I can think of is when I want to find when a show comes out and I have to read 10 paragraphs from 5 different sites to realize no one knows.I found that you can be pretty sure no one knows if it’s not already right on the results page. And if the displayed quote for a link on the results page is something like “wondering when show X is coming out?”, then it’s also a safe bet that clicking that link will be useless.You learn those patterns fast, and then the search is fast as well. reply mrits 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t disagree but having to have a learning phase for patterns sounds a bit like people clinging to an old way of things. reply jprete 13 hours agorootparentYou mean like prompt engineering?What you’re describing as “clinging to an old way of things” is how every single thing has been, ever, new or old. reply mrits 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know why you come here and say something so obviously untrue. reply layer8 15 hours agorootparentprevIt’s better to have a pattern than having no pattern with ChatGPT to tell when it’s hallucinating or not.I wish MLs were more useful than search engines, but they have still a long way to go to replace them (if they ever do). reply mrits 7 hours agorootparentGoogle still thinks I want to click on the sites I haven&#x27;t clicked on in a decade even though they are first results. Search engines have a long way to go to catch up to GPT reply whimsicalism 15 hours agorootparentprevagreed on that antipattern although fwiw chatgpt is unlikely to know the answer for questions like these either. reply xdennis 20 hours agorootparentprev> The most extreme I can think of is when I want to find when a show comes outYeah, I find that queries which can be answered in a sentence are the worst to find answers from search engines because all the results lengthen the response to an entire article, even when there isn&#x27;t an answer. reply JTon 21 hours agorootparentprevAgreed except ChatGPT (3.5 at least, haven&#x27;t tried 4) is unable to provide primary sources for its results. At least when I tried, it just provided hallucinated urls reply mhb 21 hours agorootparentTry it. There&#x27;s a world of difference. reply JTon 20 hours agorootparentIn general or for this specific application (linking primary sources)? reply mhb 20 hours agorootparentIn general. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s better at providing sources. reply jve 20 hours agorootparentprevBing Chat for me, when mostly searching IT technical or programming stuff sometimes gives junk urls, sometimes gives some real valuable urls. reply whimsicalism 15 hours agorootparentprevi love gpt-4 and i find chatgpt useless. so there is a big difference reply orbital-decay 21 hours agorootparentprevIt rather created new hybrid search engines, like perplexity and phind. reply adr1an 21 hours agorootparentprevTrue. Although the training is on a snapshot of websites, including q&a like stackoverflow. If these were replaced too, where are we heading? We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. One concern would be centralization&#x2F; lack of options and diversity. Stackoverflow started rolling AI on its own, despite the controversial way it did (dismissing long time contributors); it might be correctly following the trend. reply silon42 21 hours agorootparentPersonally I prefer stackoverflow and such, because I can see different answer including wrong or non-applicable ones which don&#x27;t solve my exact problem. reply nunobrito 20 hours agorootparentOne site doesn&#x27;t need to exclude the other.Both have their uses. reply suyash 21 hours agorootparentprevwho would have thought that few years ago, just goes to show that a Giant like Google is also susceptible when they stop innovating. The real battle is going to be fought between these two as Google&#x27;s business is majorly dependent on search ads. reply codingdave 19 hours agoparentprevLast I heard, OpenAI was losing massive amounts of money to run all this. Has that changed?Because past history shows that the first out of the gate is not the definitive winner much of the time. We aren&#x27;t still using gopher. We aren&#x27;t searching with altavista. We don&#x27;t connect to the internet with AOL.AI is going to change many things. That is all the more reason to keep working on how best to make it work, not give up and assume that efforts are \"doomed\" just because someone else built a functional tool first. reply tessierashpool 16 hours agorootparentyou&#x27;re absolutely right.also, I did not know until today&#x27;s thread that OpenAI&#x27;s stated goal is building AGI. which is probably never going to happen, ever, no matter how good technology gets.which means yes, we are absolutely looking at AltaVista here, not Google, because if you subtract a cult from an innovative business, you might be able to produce a profitable business. reply captnObvious 13 hours agorootparentWhy isn’t AGI ever going to happen? Ever? reply sdenton4 8 hours agorootparentBecause the goalposts are currently somewhere near Neptune, and expected to catch up to Voyager sometime in the next couple years. reply Palmik 18 hours agoparentprevTo some extent yes, for generic multi-modal chat-bots this could be a problem, but there are many apps that provide tight integration &#x2F; smooth tooling for whatever problem they are helping to solve, and that might be valuable to some people -- especially if it&#x27;s a real value generating use case, where the difference between 80% solution from ChatGPT and 95% solution from a bespoke tool matters. reply wslh 20 hours agoparentprevNot only \"Alexa&#x2F;Siri&#x2F;Google Home\" but Google Search [ALL] itself. Google was a pioneer in search engines adding a page ranking &#x2F; graph layers as a meaning but technologies such as ChatGPT could add a real layer of meaning, at least improve current Google Search approach. The future of search seems more conversational and contextual.BTW, I expect these technologies to be democratized and the training be in the hands of more people, if not everyone. reply m3kw9 18 hours agoparentprevThose startups noting seeing this coming as a major risk is asking for it reply _pdp_ 20 hours agoparentprevThere is still a lot to do. reply layer8 20 hours agoparentprevI never understood why they thought that this wouldn’t happen. reply moneywoes 19 hours agoparentprevany pertinent examples? i’m curious how they pivot reply yieldcrv 14 hours agoparentprevhobbyists and professionals on &#x2F;r&#x2F;localllama subreddit are having an existential crisismost of them accurately detect it is a sunk cost fallacy to continue but it looks like a form of positive thinking... and that&#x27;s the power of community! reply gumballindie 21 hours agoparentprevThis is good news - those ai companies have been freed to work on something else, along with the ai workers they employ. This is of great benefit to society. reply eshack94 21 hours agoprevI like how they silently removed the web browsing (Bing browsing) chat feature after first having it disabled for several months.A proper notice about them removing the feature would&#x27;ve been nice. Maybe I missed it (someone please correct me if wrong), but the last I heard officially it was temporarily disabled while they fix something. Next thing I know, it&#x27;s completely gone from the platform without another peep. reply cooper_ganglia 12 hours agoparentI currently have Browsing with Bing enabled as a plug-in on my account.

Not as a plugin, either, it is its own “model” to select. reply waskosky 7 hours agorootparentSince so many others including myself don&#x27;t see it, I guess that means it is getting a slow rollout which they are being extra cautious with this time. reply michelb 18 hours agoparentprevAgreed. You’re now dependent on a third party plugin. reply mrtksn 21 hours agoprevSo far the most intuitive, killer app level UX appears to be text chat. This interaction with showing it images also looks interesting as it resembles talking with a friend about a topic but let&#x27;s see if it feels like talking to a very smart person(ChatGPT is like that) or a very dumb person that somewhat recognise objects. Recognising a wrench is nowhere near as impressive as to able to talk with ChatGPT about history or make it write code that actually works.OpenAI is killing it, right? People are coming up with interesting use cases but the main way most people interact with AI, appears to be ChatGPT.However they still don&#x27;t seem to be able to nail image generation, all the cool stuff keep happening on MidJourney and StableDiffusion. reply ilaksh 21 hours agoparentOpenAI is also releasing DALLE-3 in \"early October\" and the images they chose for their demos show it demonstrating unprecedented levels of prompt understanding, including embedding full sentences of text in an output image. reply Der_Einzige 18 hours agorootparentNot unprecedented at all.

    "originBody": "To the BUG community: It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing Wednesday, September 27th as the date of the final Boston Unity Group event. Founded in the summer of 2010 by Elliott Mitchell and Alex Schwartz, BUG was the first official Unity user group in the world. At that time the Unity game engine was still a relatively new technology that empowered creators with an accessible tool for shipping games on a variety of platforms. Over the last 13 years, BUG has hosted regular monthly meetups with networking events, technical lectures, panels, interviews, parties, demo nights, workshops and more. It's been a place for us to network, share our struggles, find and give help, and learn and grow together. The consistent growth of the BUG community spawned a new era of game development in Boston and beyond. BUG's membership has grown from a few dozen to a few thousand, bringing together everyone from Boston's indies, hobbyists, AAA developers, AI researchers, museum exhibit designers, med-tech innovators, archeologists, automotive designers, software engineers, volumetric filmmakers, VR/XR game makers, educators and countless others. With growing membership our leadership team also grew. Jono Forbes, Graham Pentheny, and Chris Hart joined Elliott in organizing BUG's events and online presence. Unity lived up to its name, bringing together people with widely diverse backgrounds under a shared love for creating interactive technology. From day one, BUG was enthusiastically sanctioned and supported by Unity and former CEO David Helgason. Unity provided logistical support, Pro license giveaways, workshops, presentations, sponsorships, speaking opportunities at Unite, and so much more. In those early days, David and Unity understood that fostering grassroots groups of independent developers was essential to planting the seeds of Unity's long-term growth and building toward their goal of democratizing game development for people from all walks of life. We are immensely grateful to David and all the Unity employees who have given their time and effort to support BUG and the broader Unity community. Over the past few years, Unity has unfortunately shifted its focus away from the games industry and away from supporting developer communities. Following the IPO, the company has seemingly put profit over all else, with several acquisitions and layoffs of core personnel. Many key systems that developers need are still left in a confusing and often incomplete state, with the messaging that advertising and revenue matter more to Unity than the functionality game developers care about. Recently, Unity unveiled a set of unthinkably hostile terms of service and pricing changes for its users. The resounding, unequivocal condemnation from the games industry was unprecedented and Unity had no choice but to rescind some of the most egregious changes. Even with these new concessions, the revised pricing model disproportionately affects the success of indie studios in our community. More importantly, we've seen how easily and flippantly an executive-led business decision can risk bankrupting the studios we've worked so hard to build, threaten our livelihoods as professionals, and challenge the longevity of our industry. The Unity of today isn't the same company that it was when the group was founded, and the trust we used to have in the company has been completely eroded. Since our launch in 2010, the focus of BUG has been first and foremost about supporting developers, not the Unity company. As members of the broader Boston game developer community, we feel our efforts as organizers would be better spent creating opportunities for everyone, not just Unity users. Please join us as we all work together in the larger local development community to continue to host events and presentations for all to enjoy. We encourage our members to join the Boston Game Dev meetup group where they can continue to connect with local developers using Unity, Unreal, Godot and everything in between. The Boston Unity Group Youtube channel will continue to host recordings of past events. The final BUG meeting will be a social event next Wednesday, September 27th, held on Zoom. We'd like to take the opportunity to thank our community members for their contributions and active support, celebrate the last 13 years, and discuss Boston Game Dev and other groups our members can join to support their endeavors. At the end of the day, it was the thousands of people - participants, speakers, and organizers - who made BUG what it was. As our communities and industry evolve, let's continue to support each other and find new ways to unite. Much love, Elliott, Chris, and Graham Boston Unity Group Organizers",

It&#x27;s sad to lose a great dev community but it sounds like BUG is making the right call here. reply makeitdouble 6 hours agoparentI remember a game developer on a podcast saying that business relations in the field where not just about the money, and commitment and proof of perseverance was the strongest currency.Basically each game developer is gambling their time and livelyhood, and no one would start a game studio just to make money (that would be crazy given the odds). In this respect, a platform has to also show they&#x27;re commited and will fight in the trenches with everyone else when winter comes (basically the exact opposite of Stadia...).Unity playing with developers&#x27; trust feels like showing your pregnant wife divorce papers. You can retract it and apologize, but it will never be the same from there after. reply PostOnce 5 minutes agorootparentWhat podcast was this? Sounds interesting. reply jgilias 1 hour agorootparentprevMan, your last paragraph cracked me up! Great comparison reply MattRix 7 hours agoparentprevThere is no way this was intentional. First you’d have to argue that only the top execs were aware of this, because a bunch of Unity employees quit due to this. Secondly, if it was a form of anchoring, they did it in the worst possible way. The problem wasn’t really the numbers, it was the base idea of using installs and having it apply retroactively. If they had just wanted to anchor they could have come out with a plan at 5% revshare or something. reply LoganDark 4 hours agorootparentThey can&#x27;t ever introduce any revenue sharing because they promised not to do that and would be immensely vulnerable to lawsuits if they ever went back on that promise. This was their attempt to do something that doesn&#x27;t technically count as revenue sharing. reply olodus 3 hours agorootparentYeah I agree with you on this. This might have been the CEO too proud to not go back on his strong words against revenue share. That said the alternative they presented is a really stupid alternative. I don&#x27;t think anyone has argued that Unity shouldn&#x27;t be able to make money or increase their fees if necessary, but they should have followed their word on \"stay on the terms you signed up to\" and not do such a crazy version of fee increase as they did (install fee is a really stupid metric and that the install fee didn&#x27;t have a roof was really bad). reply rendall 4 hours agorootparentprevThey had already promised to abide by the terms of the license in force at the moment it was agreed to, so the fact that they promised not to do something does not stop them, apparently. reply LoganDark 3 hours agorootparentSomeone who agreed to a prior version of the license will always be able to abide by that version of the license. The fact that they removed the provision going forward is just them trying to lock-in future customers. reply ffgjgf1 2 hours agorootparentprevNow they kind of did though. Since you can pick between 2.5% and paying the install fee.Also I’m not sure how are “promises” legally binding unless they are part of a contract? reply LoganDark 1 hour agorootparent> Also I’m not sure how are “promises” legally binding unless they are part of a contract?You&#x27;d be surprised. Claims that are made as part of any marketing material or promotion can absolutely result in lawsuits if someone built their business on that claim and then Unity screwed them over. In that way at least, Unity is liable for the things that they say in a public capacity. reply szundi 1 hour agorootparentprevIf they are stupid, it is even worse.

Unstructured querying that I could not Google-Fu reply atoav 1 hour agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think the potential gains from the rolled back stunt will even remotely outweigh the damage done to their reputation. Maybe if they are lucky they manage to extract some short time win out of the game developers they fucked over, but in the long term they will have a hard time finding paying customers.For me the whole thing reeks of a decision by the classical manegerial narcissist, that thinks they (and by extension their company) are important because it is them and not because of a value they deliver to those using their product.Never make that mistake. Unless you sell commodity goods like toilet paper your relationship with your customer is to be treated as a valuable asset. You totally are allowed to increase prices, but if the existence of your customer depends on it, maybe consider doing so in a predictable manner (e.g. \"in one year the price will increase to X amount\"). This way customers don&#x27;t feel betrayed and can decide whether they will stay with you on a rational basis. reply uxcolumbo 40 minutes agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think this was planned.This is purely down to C-suite&#x27;s arrogance and moving into extraction mode. And not understanding their core audience. As Cory Doctorow said - enshittification.Otherwise they would have released the 2nd update faster, since they would have prepped it beforehand to reduce the pressure and bad PR building up over multiple days. reply spl757 8 hours agoparentprevIf that was the plan, it was pretty stupid. I prefer the simpler theory that this was just plain old greed and hubris. reply mcv 3 hours agorootparentIt could be both: a stupid anchoring idea driven by greed and hubris.But the fact that they tried to hide the original terms suggests to me they thought they could get away with the original plan, despite its obvious illegality. reply 3seashells 3 hours agorootparentprevBankruptcy knocking, causing panic. reply raxxorraxor 3 hours agoparentprevGiven that we deal with advertisers now, I would agree that this is very likely. This theory might increase appeal and make the first proposal more palatable, but developers aren&#x27;t stupid and many know, that the engine got far less dependable to a point where alternatives are more attractive. reply wredue 14 hours agoparentprevI was also considering this, but while this strategy works wonders on the consumer, I don’t know how well it works in more B2B offerings.Video games specifically get away with this because, as we saw with Diablo 4, people are going to give game companies money regardless how bad and unpalatable the game is.Man. My Reddit account became limited in the Diablo subreddit for saying that I cancelled my preorder after the beta. reply tacticalmook 13 hours agorootparentHistorically, subreddits were run by community volunteers because people were tired of being censored on official forums. Now subreddits are the official channel more often than not, and we&#x27;re back to square one. reply fuzzzerd 9 hours agorootparentI think this really succinctly describes why reddit sucks now. reply betamist 10 hours agorootparentprevDiscussions online have had this nature ever since they went mainstream I think. Especially Reddit I mean, some of those more popular subreddits are run mostly by kids is what I make out of it. Maybe not kids in terms of age but people who never grew up. Censorship seems to be the natural order of things in online communities where people don’t see or know each other, and when a lot of the context gets lost in the text only format. Here on HN too. Too many people with flagging abilities just flagging anything they disagree with, and good luck getting any mod’s attention after that. Unless you dance around the topic and never spell out certain types of takes, your posts will get fagged if the official narrative doesn’t match, and you will be accused of flaming.Unfortunately people have convinced themselves that some opinions -those they disagree with- are dangerous for others to read. From cancelling your preorder for a game after a beta to “let’s think twice about pharmaceutical companies’ motives”, there will be someone who thinks your motives are unclean, you’re an agitator, or full on evil, and therefor deserve to be silenced. reply DangitBobby 9 hours agorootparent> Unfortunately people have convinced themselves that some opinions -those they disagree with- are dangerous for others to read.Or more likely than seeing them as \"dangerous\" they recognize that if you allow opinions to be expressed, others may gain a new perspective by reading it or even adopt that opinion themselves.Or in the case of HN, certain topics of conversation are censored or discouraged because they tend to lead to boring&#x2F;repetitive&#x2F;annoying&#x2F;aggressive comment threads. reply ilc 12 hours agorootparentprevSome of us saw what was going to happen with D4. It was pretty obvious.After DI, and D3, to expect D4 to launch in any decent state would have been naive at best.I&#x27;ve said as much in the Diablo subreddit. D3 is now a good game, if it is what you are looking for. It&#x27;s a fun romp, but... It isn&#x27;t a truly heavy ARPG. If you want that POE is calling you. reply MattRix 7 hours agorootparentDiablo 4 was great. I put probably 50+ hours into it and enjoyed it a lot.I also completely ignored the opionion of whatever communities existed for it, because they ALWAYS complain and turn toxic, especially for Blizzard games. It’s inevitable and says very little about the actual game. Same thing happened with Overwatch 2 as well. It’s a great game yet somehow has only 10% positive reviews on Steam. reply irksomehails 6 hours agorootparentIt is okay to like and enjoy a game that the majority of the playerbase does not, I&#x27;ve had similar experience in multiple games, mostly MMORPGs and ARPGs with expansions but that does not take away from the experience of other players.It comes down to personal preference. If you find yourself liking a game&#x2F;expansion when most of the playerbase does not, it is best to avoid online forums&#x2F;subreddits where the game is put on full blast (sometimes unfairly) becuase people are extrememly emotional, when the best thing for the to do is to walk away and play games they enjoy, it is just a game the stakes couldn&#x27;t be any lower. reply bmacho 3 hours agorootparentprev> It’s a great game yet somehow has only 10% positive reviews on Steam.Or it&#x27;s an objectively very bad game that you just happen to enjoy. reply solardev 10 hours agorootparentprevLast Epoch is really good too. reply nurettin 4 hours agorootparentprevStrange, I heard from fans of 1&2 (and disliked 3) that Diablo 4 is excellent. How did you conclude that it is so bad and everyone who plays it is just a slave to blizzard? reply josephg 42 minutes agorootparentI don’t think we can see the player numbers, but the number of people following D4 twitch streams has decreased by over 99% since launch. A lot of people played it - but almost everyone who played it has stopped playing it.Personally I get it. I found D4 to be a fun, but bland and uninspired arpg. It has terrible class balance and skill balance. Despite a lot of promises, there’s almost no endgame to speak of. And there are basically no new ideas in D4 that weren’t already pioneered in D3 or path of exile. The art and music is beautiful, and the first few hours are definitely fun. But it’s not excellent by any means. It’s a bland, uninspired game lacking the depth, creativity and longevity that used to make blizzard games great. reply revlolz 13 hours agoparentprevYes, thank you, it was bothering me I could not remember the label for this.

Something along the lines of, \"Our brand is trust. It took 90 years to build it, but it would take just one day to destroy it.\"The point he was making was that this old, established company&#x27;s biggest asset was its brand, and its brand identity was just \"trust\" (they made professional products, and others could undercut them, but pros would always return to buy from them because they knew they would get what they paid for).It&#x27;s the kind of attitude I think every toolmaker (software or otherwise) should keep in mind. Professionals value trust more than they do dollars in their pocket, and the companies with the best reputation and longevity understand that.But also that company was privately owned by a family, and their name is still over the front door. I think that when the execs answer to people whose name is synonymous with the products and culture of the organization, avoiding short term profit motivated garbage strategy is part of your MO. reply gameman144 14 hours agorootparentAs an example here, my father and grandfather used to swear by Craftsman tools. No matter the context, if there was a Craftsman version, they&#x27;d go for it because they implicitly trusted the quality.Then the Craftsman brand downshifted its production quality to compete in price and their reliability fell through the floor.

It was almost entirely tool-free click&#x2F;snap fittings for full disassembly and reassembly. The parts were good quality molded, stamped or machined. It was clearly a master class in balancing competing trade-offs (price, assembly labor, reliability, noise, power, efficiency, etc). The simplicity of the thing was really remarkable.Water falls into the side at whatever rate your tap delivers, and when a pressure sensor in the reservoir indicates enough volume to start, the thing begins. It does this a few times, pumping, re-pumping, heating and replacing that reservoir depending on the selected cycle, but overall, the thing is just incredibly simple and (hopefully, somewhat?) reliable. reply berniedurfee 6 hours agorootparentYou actually bought a Haier dishwasher with a GE sticker on it.It’s hard to tell these days whether you’re buying a product from a brand you trust or from a company that bought the brand you trust.Though, having said that, I recently bought a Bosch refrigerator because Bosch is still Bosch and I trusted Bosch.But the refrigerator is crap, broken on arrival and it took 5 phone calls and 3 weeks to get service. reply Moto7451 11 hours agorootparentprevOn the bright side, due to how the Power Tool industry works, that Craftsman is in many cases the previous gen Dewalt for 1&#x2F;3 the price.

Maybe on that particular day, somebody with cholera had just taken a shit upstream, and the bacteria are totally gone now. But it&#x27;s still a useful prior, and that&#x27;s the case here with whom you choose to conduct business.I think it&#x27;s a question of burden of proof. You&#x27;d ordinarily not worry too much about cholera, but after an incident you&#x27;d want the water thoroughly and repeatedly tested. You probably would not say \"eh, it&#x27;s been 5 or 10 years, it&#x27;s most likely fine.\"Similarly you&#x27;d want some concrete evidence that a company has actually changed, in a degree sufficient to offset your negative prior, before you&#x27;d consider engaging in any further business with them.But actually doing that research is a pain in the ass, so I think it&#x27;s a reasonable strategy to simply prefer companies that haven&#x27;t screwed you over wherever good options exist. reply JohnFen 14 hours agorootparent> If you drink from a river and get cholera, would you drink from that river again in the future?No. Further, I&#x27;d stop drinking untreated water from all rivers. (Just answering your hypothetical. I spend a lot of time in the wilderness and wouldn&#x27;t drink untreated water from a river or lake to begin with.)This effect, though, has happened with software for me years ago. Enough bad actors exist that I&#x27;ve reached the place where I trust very few software houses (and I trust exactly zero SV-style companies). Not that all of those rivers are polluted, of course, but that it&#x27;s impossible to tell which ones are and which ones aren&#x27;t by looking at them.I would never dare to start a business that depended on any of them. The risk is simply too great. reply nwiswell 14 hours agorootparentI was going to observe that another totally-understandable reaction to getting fucked in a business transaction (or getting cholera from untreated water) is to begin researching everyone you do business with (or testing&#x2F;treating all the water you drink).I may be stretching the limits of the analogy here, but either way that \"verify, then trust\" approach is more work than \"adaptive blissful ignorance\", and a lot of people aren&#x27;t going to do it, or will at least slack off as the pain of the original incident becomes a more distant memory. reply JohnFen 13 hours agorootparent\"verify, then trust\" is problematic in a world where companies get bought and sold, management changes, business goals shift, etc.The only protection against this is contracts, but when a company -- like Unity has done twice now -- decides to retroactively change the terms of existing contracts, that means that you cannot trust them at all going into the future even if they&#x27;re solidly \"good\" right now. reply prerok 14 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is, I think no amount of research would have pointed to this possibility.

People assuming unity was going to add additional telemetry to track installs. (Reality: Unity seemed to always be planning on using App store numbers and the numbers from any opt-in unity services as the basis of their model). This one was a complete communication failure by unity.2. Announcing a new payment model never before used by the industry. This alone (without looking at the details) is not a huge deal, but it makes people nervous.3. This metric is hard to measure, and unity&#x27;s initial announcement was basically that they would be estimating it in their sole discretion, which makes people uncomfortable. Their fix was to allow self reporting the data, which must be based on something that reliably approximates the revised install count definition.4. Unclear definition of install was used. What they eventually settled on: once per unique end user per distribution platform (e.g. app store), was pretty much what Unity was going for anyway, but the initial announcement royally messed up here.5. The metric was abusable, and there was apparently no cap to it. This was honestly one of the biggest issues. This got fixed by adding the 2.5% revenue share cap.6. Trying to make this apply retroactively to previously published applications. This was the other biggest issue. This was especially bad because only a few years ago the company had another smaller scandal, and promised to allow people to keep using the terms of service of each version as it was when people downloaded it. Indeed, for a while this was explicitly part of the terms, and people who used those versions probably could get a court to side with them.If they had listened to their engineers, I think they could have fixed&#x2F;avoided 1, 4, and 6. Numbers 3 and 5 may have remained, still causing huge outcry, and eventually getting fixed, but at least if number 6 were addressed before initial announcement, it would not have been a loss-of-trust issue so much as a: you are a moron for proposing this without the needed backstop, and requiring companies to blindly trust your estimations. reply lolinder 10 hours agorootparent#1 would have been much less of a problem if it weren&#x27;t for the IronSource merger [0].

Products like Word&#x2F;Excel&#x2F;PowerPoint&#x2F;etc, Visual Studio, Photoshop, Figma, Windows and Mac all have many open source alternatives, but the fact that these products and companies have been hugely successfully and continue to do so says something -- commercial companies can organize and reward work in a way hardly found in open source projects, and their products often provide added value (more features&#x2F;specific support for certain workflows&#x2F;professionally designed UX&#x2F;product support etc) that can be rare or nonexistent in open source projects.

Just more profits?It seemed to be specifically aimed at free to play mobile games - and if studios really had to pay per install, it would basically kill this entire genre on Unity (because it would count every install of f2p games, even though people aren&#x27;t buying them - so the economics don&#x27;t work out, and the more popular the game, the harder is to pay the install fees).Except that.. they later announced that they would waive the install fees if mobile devs migrated to their ad solution. So they didn&#x27;t want anyone to actually pay the install fee; the idea is that game devs would need to choose between shutting down their game, or using Unity&#x27;s ad tech.So in the end this was all a ploy to get ad revenue, which is analogous to revenue share, but for f2p games.Here are some sources for this (I just found at Google, but I saw this discussed in many places)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Unity3D&#x2F;comments&#x2F;16j6cip&#x2F;ironsource...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobilegamer.biz&#x2F;unity-is-offering-a-runtime-fee-waiv... reply Already__Taken 3 hours agorootparentburning a real game engine business that enhances an industry (a lot of new talent is coming in through learning unity) to pivot into the advertising scam as the big players desperately try to diversify... that&#x27;s some weapons grade MBA short sightedness.advertising in mobile games too, that&#x27;s like barely under the table gambling.

It seems unnaturally likely to me that single decision by Mattrick&#x27;s Xbox leadership is the largest component to Xbox One&#x27;s relatively lower success (58M sales, versus 102M PS4 and 84M XB360), and has cascaded to, possibly permanently, suppress Xbox&#x27;s potential (Series is at 21M to PS5&#x27;s 41M).I tend to think that decision was worse, because it was Just Bad. There was no reason they had to do it. It had very little prior art (digital games, naturally, always did this, so non-zero). It was a pure, absolute failure to read the room, and the XB1 era had so many decisions like this that it seriously paints the picture that Xbox is alive today literally only because of Spencer and despite Microsoft&#x27;s leadership at the time (pre-release, Xbox One also required Kinect to be plugged in. This was walked back, but it still shipped in the box, lowering margins and depressing sales volume for no reason.)In comparison: Unity has been in trouble for a long time. They&#x27;ve never posted a profit, at least since going public, and have instead accumulated an aggregate of over $2B in losses. Their main competitor (Epic) is a technological savant of a company, which has a literal money-printing machine in their closet to finance engine development. They never really broke into AAA game production, partly because Unreal is just better at hyper-scale development, and partly because AAA game shops are surprisingly welcoming to in-house engine development.In that framing, this outcome seems inevitable. There&#x27;s a reason they made this decision; a very real, dollars and cents, reason, and backing away from it (especially after the outcry, but even without it) isn&#x27;t going to save them. The best, but unlikely, outcome for Unity and their customers is deep layoffs, focusing hard on ease of use instead of technological prowess, spending years rebuilding the trust they lost, and depressing their stock price enough that they can find a path to going private without losing control. The much more realistic outcome is: deep layoffs, coasting the product, monetizing every addon they can outside of the toxic \"core pricing structure\", and private equity acquisition. reply SecretDracula 9 hours agorootparentThe dumbest thing about Microsoft&#x27;s \"no game sharing\" thing is that they could have just waited.

If the reason is \"everyone stopped using Unity, we don&#x27;t have any members\" then I understand, but the press release didn&#x27;t say that. In fact it implied there might be thousands of members.The closest thing to a reason they gave was that Unity has become hostile to indie devs. But Unity doesn&#x27;t run BUG, so if some people are still using Unity, which I assume is the case, wouldn&#x27;t they still benefit from having a users group? If it&#x27;s an act of protest by the group organizers, that seems annoying for the people who still use Unity and got value out of having access to that community.Without sufficient context to understand the decision, I find I&#x27;m not sure what this act accomplishes, or what it intended to accomplish. reply deely3 14 hours agoparentI think one of the reason of the group existing is because members trusted Unity.

They could stop spending that money, their income would remain the same, and then they would be profitable. reply generalizations 15 hours agorootparentprevWell, that kinda makes sense then. If they weren&#x27;t profitable, then this could be seen as a last-ditch survival strategy. reply gs17 15 hours agorootparentThis strategy is still pretty awful. If 2.5% revenue share after $1,000,000 would be enough to survive on, they probably could have opened with matching Unreal&#x27;s 5% instead of all the bullshit and won people over. reply kevingadd 14 hours agorootparentYeah their new pricing model is quite literally more expensive than Unreal for many of their customers (mostly the ones who make less money - for massive studios it&#x27;s cheaper) and it&#x27;s ALSO more complex to comply with. A simple \"we&#x27;re doing revshare now, and the per-seat fee is going away\" would have been viewed more favorably I think. reply tetha 12 hours agorootparentI mean in my naive world, you&#x27;d slap some minimum revenue onto the rev-share and you&#x27;d have a clear separation between hobbyists, unsuccessful indies, indies, and huge successes. It&#x27;d be muddled in the middle, sure, but if some companies hits jackpot with a unity project, you&#x27;ll know and could act on it. reply TylerE 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s what they did though. It was several hundred thousand dollars in revenue before any of it kicked in. replyandrewclunn 14 hours agorootparentprevBuild product &#x2F; service at a loss.

Completely voluntary and works even within a capitalist system.Now all we have to do is hope Unity goes under really quickly, then gets bought up for cheap by a business either willing to make far less as their investment was well below the cost of development for the tools... or that another sucker comes along to buy them at a higher price to either enter the market or expand their own dominance in it as they are still on their \"chase growth\" curve. reply dylan604 15 hours agoparentprevi remember back when Avid decided they were no longer going to offer a Mac version of their NLEs because Apple&#x27;s new machines were only going to have 3 expansion slots. while admittedly, there were probably a much smaller number of affected users than the Unity decision, it did cause a huge amount of turmoil. urban legend has people dumping their Avid stations on the doorstep of the Avid offices.Avid survived.

We need more engineer solidarity not more divisiveness. Give me a list of your past employers and I can guarantee I can find some sketchball business practice you indirectly contributed to and make some tenuous argument for you to be blackballed.95% of shitty tech industry practices can be root caused to people identify more strongly with their employer than with their profession. We desperately need a professional organization &#x2F; union with teeth and the main thing that should be shunned is rhetoric that divides rather than unites it .Engineers can hang together or hang separately. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentYou must subscribe to the idea that the employees can change the culture of a company from bottom up. I strongly disagree. Company culture is dictated from top down, and only rarely does the bottom get to make substantive changes.

I hope this meager donation helps keep this resource online. – Gideon M., Sep-2023 I've enjoyed your site throughout the years and learned today about the donation page to support the operations. Hoping my small bit can help bring joy to others as well. – Dom N., Sep-2023 Long live Ian’s Shoelace Site. – Magnus R., Sep-2023 I just wanted to thank you for your knot (not something I'd ever thought I'd write in an email). Many years back, I was referred to your site from some distant corner of the internet and discovered your “Ian Knot”. For the fun of it, I challenged myself to learn this and several other knots, which has been extremely useful more often than I'd have guessed. I greatly appreciate the effort you put into not only providing a nice collection of resources, but in making them easy to absorb through diagrams and descriptions. I learned a collection of knots through scouting long ago, but as an avid hiker, the Ian Knot especially has saved time and shoelaces. I realized yesterday while teaching knots (including yours) to a group of kids that you may not always see your impact. I'm glad to see that your site it still up, In short, thank you. – Jeremy S., Aug-2023 I hadn't been on the site for quite awhile but just picked up a new “used” pair of sneakers at our local thrift store; so I wanted to give them some groovy lacing method (as I do with every lace up shoes I have, since I found you) and I see the new flip option!! Oh how this will help me. I'm one of those who doesn't know right from left and up from down. So yeah 🎉😁 and Thanks. P.S. because of you, I learned I had been trying my shoes wrong for over 50 years and never wore lace up athletic shoes because they constantly come untied and made the tops of my feet go numb...but now I've learned so much from your site! Thank you thank you thank you – Krista E., Colorado, USA, Aug-2023 First, a big thank you for the nice and useful website.

I never mastered the asymmetrical single-loop method, so all my life I&#x27;d been doing the bunny ears. Maybe the asymmetrical method doesn&#x27;t make sense to me for a symmetrical knot.

He just says his is a different way of tying it.And I second that it&#x27;s the best knot for tying laces. Especially if you have synthetic laces (common on some trekking shoes) that come undone easily. reply m463 4 hours agorootparentprevI use this knot all. the. time.Wonder if there is a way to get the loops to stay sideways. With thick&#x2F;stiff laces, they seem to end up orienting themselves up-and-down. reply mcv 2 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re making a granny knot. If you want the loops to stay sideways, you have to reverse directions between the first and second half of the knot.

Loafers are amazing.US adults (and, to a lesser extent, those in Europe—I gather the loafer caps out a bit lower there as far as how “high up” you can dress it) can get away with wearing slip-on shoes a whole lot of the time, while also looking smarter-dressed than sneakers or what have you.Doesn’t get you away from laces entirely, but can seriously cut down on how often you have to fiddle with them.(Or you can come at it the other way and become a Crocs Guy, of course) reply wffurr 15 hours agoprevI didn&#x27;t learn how to tie my shoes correctly until I read this website in my 20s.

It’s just a regular knot but it’s faster to tie than anything else.The key detail is to not end up with a granny knot. The way you tie your initial overhand knot needs to match so that it sits correctly and doesn’t come untied.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fieggen.com&#x2F;shoelace&#x2F;ianknot.htmhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fieggen.com&#x2F;shoelace&#x2F;grannyknot.htm reply jjice 16 hours agoparentAgreed.

My dad showed me this because it&#x27;s the way he tied his shoes and he was born in 1912. reply GuB-42 14 hours agoparentIan probably re-invented it, like many people before him, but unlike your dad, and I guess, many other dads, he made a website, and the website became successful.There are only so many ways to twist a string, and practical knots tend to be simple, knots get reinvented all the time before ending in a book. This is also why there there is no approximation in knox tying. If your knot is slightly different than what&#x27;s on the book, it is probably another knot (see: square knot, granny knot, thief knot, grief knot), or just a mistake no one bothered to give it a name. reply toasteros 16 hours agoprevDespite years in the Scouts, both as a participant and a Leader, I am embarrassingly bad at knots. I&#x27;ve always had a terrible time following visual directions given to me by someone trying to teach me a knot, and even worse at following picture guides, videos, gifs etc.I can reliably teach an 8 year old Cub Scout how to do a reef knot and a clovehitch and that&#x27;s about it.For my shoelaces, I was making two buddy ears and just tying them together. I&#x27;d seen the Ian knot in a TED video as well as on this site and just couldn&#x27;t get it. I tried over and over again only for the laces to flaccidly flop out of my hands, or for me to end up with a simple overhand knot.It struck me one day, like a bolt of lightning, all of a sudden I was able to tie it. And boy am I glad I did. I think I was able to piece together how I needed to avoid a granny knot, but otherwise the inspiration was completely inexplicable.Tying my laces with the Ian knot is such a small thing, but if you piece together enough of those little things your life will change drastically - for the better. If you can only do one thing for yourself this week, learn the Ian knot. reply turtledragonfly 15 hours agoprevHere&#x27;s a nice short TED talk on tying your shoes right: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;terry_moore_how_to_tie_your_shoesIt doesn&#x27;t use the \"Ian&#x27;s Secure Shoelace Knot\", but it shows that for the typical way of tying your shoes, there is a \"strong form\" and a \"weak form\", and shows you how to tell the difference.I got lucky and have been tying the strong form my whole life, but it&#x27;s sorta 50&#x2F;50 depending on how you learn. reply bjackman 3 hours agoprevI love that the Ian know exists. But after I learned it I tried it for a while and it didn&#x27;t stick, I went back to the classic knot I learned as a kid after a week or so.IIRC the reason was \"yield\" - I found my Ian knots were often wonky. So you save 2-3 seconds but the tradeoff is mental energy for doing \"QA\" on your shoelace knot!But that was many years ago, I should try again.

It&#x27;s especially excellent for using on little kids shoes, which will come untied all the time.

You know you got it right when the loops fall perfectly to each side. It rarely if ever comes undone because it has better physics. And it&#x27;s only one step to learn differently.

Note that even though this contraption has checker board pattern, there is and attemtpt to cover \"hole\" in the center. Each layer of fans is stacked on each other, so overall thickness is three fans. Size - 9 fans. 2018-08-01Improved design where rows greatly overlap eachother so overall thickness is just a little bit over single fan. First power supply (200-300w) is added. First running model, however does not have a name yet. Size - 8 fans. 2018-08-01The design proves to be scalable and grows fast. Size - 10 fans. 2018-08-16More fans are added. In addition, candidates for the Fan Base are considered including the case (white) that is currently used. Size - 17 fans. 2018-08-17Fan matrix. Size - 17 fans. 2018-08-25Bigger fan matrix. Power supply fan is removed and power supply is cooled by fan. Note a piece of paper on power supply with \"Fantilator\" on it. Fantilator is tied to a table using a cable so it would not tip over. Size - 37 fans. 2018-09-11Fans connected using proper 4 pin splitters. Size - 37 fans. 2018-09-28Even bigger fan matrix. One power supply was not enough to power all fans, so second one was added. Size - 46 fans. 2018-12-10A very interesting and rare photo that shows how old fantilator is being disassembled while new one is assembled. Old design was perpendicular to table, new one is diagonal. Old fantilator remains also have white Christmas lights on. 2018-12-11Phase I of new Fantilator design. First design that was first thought about and only then executed. Four fans attached together in a plus shape form a \"cross\" and are connected via 1-to-4 4 pin splitter. 8 crosses (2x4, 32 fans total) form a \"cluster\" and other ends of \"crosses\" splitters are connected to 1-to-10 \"cluster\" splitter. New design has better cable management, proper cable splitters, better base known as Fanbase, threshold for fan power (>=0.4 amps). Size - 32 fans (one \"cluster\"). 2019-05-10Finished Phase II upgrade.

These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, a gun, and a bullet.[2][3] There were no separate stages. Abramović and the visitors stood in the same space, making it clear that the latter were part of the work.[4] The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: \"What is the public about and what are they going to do in this kind of situation?\"[5] Performance[edit] Her instructions were Instructions: There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired. Performance. I am the object. During this period I take full responsibility. Duration: 6 hours (8 pm – 2 am).[6] Abramović said the work \"pushed her body to the limits\".[5] Visitors were gentle to begin with, offering her a rose or a kiss.[2] Art critic Thomas McEvilley, who was present, wrote: It began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust her arms into the air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately. The Neapolitan night began to heat up. In the third hour all her clothes were cut from her with razor blades. In the fourth hour the same blades began to explore her skin. Her throat was slashed so someone could suck her blood. Various minor sexual assaults were carried out on her body. She was so committed to the piece that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Faced with her abdication of will, with its implied collapse of human psychology, a protective group began to define itself in the audience. When a loaded gun was thrust to Marina's head and her own finger was being worked around the trigger, a fight broke out between the audience factions.\"[7] As Abramović described it later: \"What I learned was that ... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you ... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"[8] When the gallery announced the work was over, and Abramović began to move again, she said the audience left, unable to face her as a person.[9] Reception[edit] Rhythm 0 ranked ninth on a Complex list of the greatest works of performance art ever done.[10] See also[edit] Endurance art The Death of The Artist Empathy and Prostitution Stanford prison experiment Milgram experiment References[edit] ^ Abramović, Marina; Thompson, Chris; Weslien, Katarina (2006). \"Pure Raw: Performance, Pedagogy, and (Re)presentation\".

Reading about it again, I’m intrigued by how much of the surrounding discourse (including the artist’s own comments) talks about “audience” and “public” and “humanity” in the abstract.It seems to me that the outcome would have been heavily dependent on _who specifically_ was in the room. In that way, the piece speaks more to the psyche of _an_ audience and _a_ public, rather than _the_.I’m also curious what people think of the name? reply Joeboy 17 hours agoparentI&#x27;m afraid this is very much an \"a man in a pub told me\" anecdote, but a while ago I chatted with somebody who apparently interviewed people who attended the original Rhythm 0. She said that initially people were reluctant to behave in the violent ways expected, and Abromović&#x27;s assistants were telling people they were spoiling the art by being too timid. None of the online write-ups mention this so idk, but it would make a lot of sense. The piece would&#x27;ve been a damp squib if (a few of) the audience hadn&#x27;t behaved as they did.Either way, perhaps it makes sense to think of the audience reaction as artistic collaboration, rather than innate human visciousness. reply rendall 17 hours agorootparentThis is really an important piece of information to understand the original art! The interpretation is vastly different because of this!It reminds me of a story I heard about John Cage&#x27;s Music of Changes, which was famously composed randomly. John Cage purportedly threw coins and consulted the I Ching to determine each subsequent note. However, during a memorial at John Cage&#x27;s death, David Tudor told a story about how he saw John Cage just writing down the notes and not throwing coins. When he asked for an explanation, John Cage said the he did not have to throw coins \"because my mind is random.\" reply red_admiral 1 hour agorootparent> because my mind is randomI can&#x27;t find the source, but I think it&#x27;s Scott Aaronson who told a story of a device with two buttons, which students were invited to press as rendomly as possible, but training a simple Markov model allowed them to predict what button an individual would press next most of the time. Student after student tried to trick the predictor, and failed. Then this one guy comes along and mashes the buttons and the prediction accuracy never goes above 50%. When they asked how he was doing it, he said he \"just used my free will\". reply jancsika 14 hours agorootparentprev> When he asked for an explanation, John Cage said the he did not have to throw coins \"because my mind is random.\"Was Cage claiming some kind of spiritual musical connection from choosing pitches based on the I Ching? If not, then it was just a practical compositional consideration. He didn&#x27;t need cryptographically secure sequences, and-- at least in terms of music cognition-- at worst he ended up repeating consecutive pitches fewer times than he should have. (And if he started with I Ching-derived patterns he may have noticed the repetitions and successfully emulated them with his mind!)After all, his general need for random processes was to avoid accidentally falling back into patterns from the common practice period of tonal music (esp. patterns from the Romantic era). In other words, his mind was basically good enough for the avant garde. :) reply WhitneyLand 16 hours agorootparentprevYes!

Certainly, I don&#x27;t assume the stories told in standup are precisely true. But it&#x27;s poor form to make up a story about being a victim of bigotry.I do question if it&#x27;s unfair that a non-minority comic can make up stories about whatever and I don&#x27;t necessarily feel that&#x27;s a problem. But I think it&#x27;s the fact that people will assume you&#x27;ve been victimized as a thing to know about you outside of your performance that feels wrong. reply cameldrv 13 hours agorootparentprevSimilar story, I used to know an artist who knew her casually. He said that she was intensely aware of the commercial aspect of her work and is basically the art equivalent of a shock jock. She gets a lot of attention and makes a lot of money from doing the most outrageous things she can think of. reply lolinder 18 hours agoparentprevGiven the date, I suspect it was influenced by the Stanford Prison Experiment, which was just three years prior. We now know that Stanford Prison was not an experiment at all [0], but at the time I imagine it was fresh on everyone&#x27;s minds and believed uncritically.The proximity to Stanford Prison, coupled with the time (8pm-2am) and her wording (\"There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired. Performance. I am the object.\") go a long way towards explaining what happened here. Not that the behavior is acceptable or justified, but that it certainly should not be used to come to any bleak conclusions about humans in general.EDIT: Also, it&#x27;s important to note that she had in the prior year performed four different pieces that left her wounded or unconscious. We don&#x27;t know what they were told in advance, but the audience was almost certainly aware of her MO when they showed up and expecting something intense. That would both have an impact on the kind of person who chose to be there and on their behavior once present.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;6&#x2F;13&#x2F;17449118&#x2F;stanford-prison-exper... reply Joeboy 17 hours agorootparentThere was a vogue for stuff about man&#x27;s innate inhumanity around this time.

It&#x27;s not just \"an audience\" but a very divided audience.When you watch it back it&#x27;s predominantly men who grope her body, harass her and laugh despite her visible tears.I&#x27;ve seen this piece discussed in various places. Sometimes the gendered and sexual element of the violence against the artist is the main thing that is touched upon.

Why assume without any other indication that this would have been different had the artist been a man? Or if the audience would have been only women? reply AlecSchueler 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a few reasons. First: the very visible recorded gender disparity in the audience reaction within the performance itself. Further: the statistical facts of gender based violence. The reaction in the case of this performance mirrors the reality outside the performance hall, where women almost inevitably face various level of gender based violence throughout their lives.Lastly I&#x27;d also say because I believe (although I could be wrong) the gender divide of HN is unbalanced towards men like myself, so it can be helpful to raise these issues at times where our blindspots might lead us to miss interesting or important elements of the stories shared. In cases where that blindness helps real world violence to thrive I feel it&#x27;s doubly important that we can discuss it without getting defensive.> Why assume without any other indication that this would have been different had the artist been a man?Without any other indicator? Like I say, we have huge indicators in the statistical makeup of violence outside of the performance hall. Women are far more likely to experience sexual violence. Indeed, the likelihood of Marina experiencing sexual assault at work would have already been non-negligible even if she wasn&#x27;t inviting interaction.> Or if the audience would have been only women?Please note: the audience in reality wasn&#x27;t \"only men.\" it was a basically even mix, but the violence of the reactions was far from balanced. reply EatingWithForks 17 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;re missing the point of an art, especially art where the audience participates.

Sure, there are always individuals that never conform to any groups, and they&#x27;ll stick out, but most of the common human will start acting as a \"person\" rather than \"John\" when joining a group in a public setting. reply lolinder 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s still valid to argue that this was an audience, rather than something generalizable to humankind. Conformity looks very different depending on context: if this piece were being performed in an Amish community it would look very different than it did, not because of less group conformity (there would likely be stronger conformity) but because of conformity to different norms. reply AlecSchueler 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a piece though.

That suggests that the audience is self-selected away from people who have jobs or families, and that the audience was primed to expect that she wanted a violent performance.

You are \"hidden\" in a crowd. The crowd starts off with harmless actions but the get more intense over time, the boundary is pushed continuously. As long as you can hide in the crowd, you cheer. But as soon as you have to answer as an individual, you turn into a coward.Of course you might think of specific contexts, in which the outcome would be different. But in a general setting? Why should this be the case?The performance took place in 1974, barely 30 years after the fall of the Nazi regime. Under this regime, a whole people was put in a similar situation, where the treatment and dehumanization (i.e. objectification) of specific groups (in particular, Jews) got worse over time, publicly and continuously. I think in this historical context, the performance clearly referred to that time. I don&#x27;t remember the 1970&#x27;s, but in the 80&#x27;s and still in the 90&#x27;s, WW2 and the Third Reich were very much present in the public mind and often referred to in conversation. One example is Todd Strasser&#x27;s novel The Wave from 1981, which shows how an \"innocent\" audience is transformed into an aggressive mob. I remember that this novel, and the movies based upon it, led to discussions where some people claimed \"this certainly wouldn&#x27;t happen here&#x2F;to us&#x2F;to me&#x2F;now\".I think it needs a good explanation why today, or a different crowd, would be any different. reply SAI_Peregrinus 17 hours agorootparentNot a random audience.

Sin and the need for Jesus&#x27;s salvation are universal through the branches of Christianity I&#x27;ve experienced.

I know nothing about Orthodox Christianity, but I would expect them to fit in there somewhere. Catholics and Protestants argue about salvation through faith or salvation through works, but they both see it as something desirable.There are lots of branches of Christianity, and so I don&#x27;t have a full picture, but I&#x27;ve never heard of one that didn&#x27;t share this belief, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d understand what their faith is all about at that point.

I&#x27;ve never heard of this study before but I have studied some Buddhist teachings.

Everything on that table is an object that anyone can easily acquire and walk around with (and use). I have no idea, but \"please attack me\" would be my absolute last thought.I understand there were suggestive instructions, but it&#x27;s a piece of art produced by a human being.

The sign explicitly encourages people to use the items on the artist. It’s really not far off from literally spelling out “please attack me”.Of course that doesn&#x27;t excuse people who do so in any way, they’re still the perpetrator. But I think your hunting rifle comparison isn’t very good. reply EatingWithForks 16 hours agorootparentI would still disagree.

I think the fact that people had a choice _not to_ use an implement is just as important as the fact that they had a choice _to_ use an implement. Also important: _how_ the implement was used. When I read about this performance, it&#x27;s pretty immediately evident that the choice was a large part of this performance. reply burkaman 16 hours agorootparentprevOk, what about songs titled \"Rape Me\" or \"Kill Me\". When you heard \"Try That in a Small Town\", did that inspire you to go to a small town and actually try it? Does it confuse you when people attending a live Papa Roach show don&#x27;t actually try to cut his life into pieces? I mean he literally just told them to, how could it be any more spelled out?Maybe music doesn&#x27;t count for some reason. How about something more interactive, like those \"living history\" reenactment villages (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colonialwilliamsburg.org&#x2F;). An actor comes up and challenges you to a duel. Do you accept and actually fight them? Someone on a soapbox in the town square is exhorting listeners to take up arms against the redcoats. As a matter of fact, you just toured an armory, and you see a patrol of British soldiers a few hundred feet away. Do you go arm yourself and attack the soldiers? Can you point to something concrete that differentiates these live interactive performers from Abramovic?Is there any other piece of art where you&#x27;d take the content literally and attack the performer? Actually it&#x27;s more than that, because if I took these instructions literally I still wouldn&#x27;t attack her, since I don&#x27;t desire to. You are making a leap that I still don&#x27;t understand from \"use as desired\" to \"well obviously anyone would desire to hurt her\". reply Joeboy 16 hours agorootparentYou are either pretending, or refusing, or failing, to understand subtext and intent. reply burkaman 16 hours agorootparentYes I am failing to understand the subtext other people are reading into this piece, and haven&#x27;t seen a single comment attempt to explain it. What is the chain of logic that leads from \"it says to do whatever I want\" to \"I will attack\"? reply Joeboy 16 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t there and didn&#x27;t attack anybody, but the chain of logic suggested is that Abramović was known for works involving bodily discomfort, injury and risk, and that it was reasonable to assume she intended this piece to be in a similar vein. In that context, placing dangerous objects on a table and saying \"one can use [them] on me as desired\" is not just saying the objects exist, in the same way that saying \"do you have any ketchup?\" is not just asking whether your host possesses ketchup.I can see why somebody might be uncomfortable with the general shape of argument from a \"victim blaming\" point of view. If you genuinely don&#x27;t understand it then again, not trying to be a dick here but perhaps you don&#x27;t understand subtext and intent in the way most people do. reply burkaman 15 hours agorootparentThank you, this is a good explanation, but it isn&#x27;t addressing my core point. I understand that Abramovic intentionally put herself in a vulnerable position, and that the instructions and weapons are intended to say something like \"you could hurt me with these\". What I am still not understanding is the transition from \"could\" to \"should\". The context, that this is an art piece and the artist has performatively hurt herself in the past, to me reinforces the idea that I shouldn&#x27;t actually hurt her. To me the message is \"I could, but we&#x27;re both human beings so obviously I won&#x27;t\". To me, someone who takes it so literally that they actually attack is missing the subtext and context that this is art, this is a performance, this is a person and not a statue. They are failing to understand the difference between could and should.The question I responded to is: \"At least two thirds of the table is covered in various instruments of harm. What does that say to the viewer?\" I maintain that \"it says I&#x27;m supposed to hurt her\" is not a rational answer. With the additional context that she usually hurts herself in these performances, it is understandable to have that thought, but not understandable or rational to act on it. I can think of lots of art that is intended to make you think about your capacity to hurt innocent people, but none that is intended to make you actually act on that.Let me put it one other way: the commenter I initially replied to said that the presence of weapons on the table is useful context that should explain the actions of the audience members. I disagree, I don&#x27;t think the presence of weapons is relevant at all or provides any amount of justification. I think the context you provided, that she usually hurts herself, is useful and does change my interpretation of her intent, but it still doesn&#x27;t justify what anybody did. I still don&#x27;t understand why somebody would choose to attack her. I also am a little bit skeptical that the audience would have been familiar with her other work. I&#x27;m not sure how the audience was chosen, but I don&#x27;t believe the average person would have any idea who she was. reply rcoveson 14 hours agorootparentThis is art. Think about writing a book, directing a TV show, or putting on a play. What should happen? There should probably be intrigue, emotion, and excitement. Very likely violence and evil. We should explore a broad spectrum of emotion. It&#x27;s perfectly likely that most of what we explore is negative emotion, because originality is hard and positive emotion is arguably over-explored if you look at art as a whole through all of human history.But this isn&#x27;t just some mass-produced movie or family-friendly Broadway production. This is the cutting edge of art. It&#x27;s supposed to challenge us. So perhaps we&#x27;ll go beyond merely pretending at violence and do a tiny bit of actual violence. It&#x27;s plausible, from a participant&#x27;s perspective, that the creator of the piece intended that.That&#x27;s what I imagine the participants are thinking, anyways. They aren&#x27;t just average folks of the street, after all, they&#x27;re attendees at a crazy art exhibit. They&#x27;ve got to compete with people who hang themselves up by hooks driven through their skin, people who bite the heads of bats during rock concerts, and people who whip each other bloody in sadist orgies. reply Joeboy 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not really clear what \"supposed to\" or \"should\" mean here. I&#x27;m pretty certain the audience would&#x27;ve understood it was expected that Abramović would sustain some sort of injury or discomfort, in line with her other pieces. I very much doubt anybody would subject themselves to a six hour performance without any idea what to expect. If nobody had obliged, I think it&#x27;s fair to assume Abramović would&#x27;ve left disappointed, and would probably not be the conceptual art superstar she is today.There&#x27;s a whole world of consensual injury that to be honest I&#x27;m fairly personally prudish about, but nobody is making either of us participate in it. If people want to do it, if I&#x27;m honest I&#x27;m slightly judgmental but I feel like I should be less so. reply kortex 10 hours agorootparentprevAs a performance artist myself, I think there is definitely an aspect of \"the audience should hurt me a little bit, or at the very least threaten harm\". Why are people fascinated with fire breathers, motorcycle jumpers, escape artists, etc? It&#x27;s the thrill of risk.Even without knowledge of her or her works, there&#x27;s a lot of context that says \"the risk is the point\".By putting harmful items out on the table, she made a deliberate choice for risk to be involved. The audience knows this. They know if she wanted a \"safe\" performance, she would have limited her selection. If the worst items were glue and feathers, the implied worse outcome is making her look like a chicken. Embarrassing, but not a huge harm. She put out a gun and a bullet. That implies (but does not outright verbatim say) that the sky is the limit - shooting me is an acceptable outcome.That establishes the conceptual limit, but there are still societal shackles on behavior. Which is where \"it&#x27;s all about the risk\" comes in. More risk = more sensational news, more notoriety for the artist. Clearly she wants something crazy to happen, else she would not put herself in a crazy position. So the audience starts pushing the limits of what is acceptable. I don&#x27;t think they are harming her out of a direct desire to cause her harm, per se (might be some sadists in the audience), but there is an expectation that the risk level should ratchet up. But that ratchet doesn&#x27;t occur without audience participation.I think this perspective actually tempers the \"this piece shows all humans are terrible sadists deep down\" interpretation. Just like the Milgram experiments, it boils down to the general principle of humans tending to do the thing they think is expected of them. replycivilized 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat it says to me is not necessarily \"please attack me\" but \"I want to see what happens if you are offered these temptations, and this is most of what I am interested in during this performance\".It&#x27;s quite dark. She could have offered many other more benign, creative, playful options. reply burkaman 15 hours agorootparentShe did, there&#x27;s a full list here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tate.org.uk&#x2F;art&#x2F;artworks&#x2F;abramovic-rhythm-0-t148...Only ~6 of them are things that I would classify as \"weapons\", and maybe ~10 others are not weapons but things that you could obviously use to hurt her (scissors, needle, etc.) There was food, paint, clothes, makeup for anyone that wanted to do something benign and creative.I disagree that the weapons were \"temptations\". It is not normal to be tempted to hurt someone merely because you have a weapon and opportunity. reply civilized 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re quite sure you don&#x27;t see the difference between (1) a decorative hunting rifle and (2) laying out a large array of weapons and other dangerous objects for an audience and saying the following to that audience?> Instructions:> There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.> Performance.> I am the object.> During this period I take full responsibility.I agree it&#x27;s not normal to want to hurt someone just because you have an opportunity, but you really don&#x27;t see the artist doing anything to shift the possibilities of \"normal\", by phrasing the instructions in this way? reply burkaman 13 hours agorootparentI do see a difference, I just don&#x27;t agree that the intended message is \"please literally hurt me\". Even if you believe that is the intended message, it still isn&#x27;t rational or acceptable to act on it. reply civilized 13 hours agorootparentWe agreed on that two posts ago, so maybe there&#x27;s nothing further to discuss. replychankstein38 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;d go bad either but when I go to my friend&#x27;s house and they&#x27;ve got decorative hunting rifles they usually lack a sign instructing to \"Use this on me however you wish\" reply burkaman 14 hours agorootparentBut if there were such a sign, you still wouldn&#x27;t shoot them. So in what context would you actually shoot? Maybe if it was a stranger instead of your friend? Maybe if they said \"don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s art, it&#x27;s ok\"? I&#x27;m trying to understand what about the context here is making the audience members&#x27; actions seem normal and expected to some commenters here. reply chankstein38 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s fair. Honestly I think the difference I&#x27;m thinking about is deindividuation stemming from being in a crowd that is in this situation. I&#x27;m still pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t shoot but if everyone else was poking with a pen I might also.I guess my point is that there are a lot of factors in this situation that aren&#x27;t just individuals making decisions.Even thinking about the Milgram experiment, though of course that was authority figures telling them what to do, in a crowd I feel like the people who take charge and start some action typically end up being a defacto authority figure.I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re wrong though that there are DEFINITELY some outliers in this. The blood drinking is weird. The person holding the gun to her head is probably cause for a mental evaluation.But, overall, I feel like I can&#x27;t blame some of the more mild cases presented here for their actions. reply bondarchuk 19 hours agorootparentprevOh well it quite changes my view of events that she herself provided the loaded gun. I did not read the wiki article that way. reply garciasn 19 hours agoparentprevI mean, I know nothing more about the piece than what I&#x27;ve just read, but wow, that&#x27;s a take and a half. I just cannot fathom viewing what she attempted the way you did.If anything, it offered the opportunity for humanity to reveal something beautiful, but instead, the audience took the opposite opportunity--something I honestly feel you have done here, but in words, which I almost felt as thorns in my bellybutton. reply shwaj 16 hours agorootparentThere’s another anecdotal comment where someone heard that the audience was too tame, and some time into the performance they were prompted&#x2F;goaded into interacting in more controversial ways, otherwise the performance would have been a dud.If this is true, then it tends to support the GP post’s take: there was an intention to bring out the worst, not a neutral attempt to see what would happen. reply burkaman 16 hours agorootparentWere you able to find anything backing that up? I wasn&#x27;t, and this is a very famous and thoroughly analyzed piece of art. Given the lack of evidence I&#x27;m leaning towards not believing that anonymous third-hand account. reply rcoveson 16 hours agorootparentprevEven if we disregard the anecdote, we can at least infer that the intention was to make an original, evocative piece of performance art. How does that implied goal cause people to act? Like a bunch of avant-garde nutjobs, maybe? reply burkaman 17 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, that is one of the worst comments I&#x27;ve ever seen on HN. I am usually able to understand and empathize with opinions I disagree with, but that comment is just incomprehensible. I guess that&#x27;s the point of the piece? I don&#x27;t know if I would have been exposed to a worldview so opposite to mine if we didn&#x27;t have this artwork to discuss. reply rcoveson 16 hours agorootparentprevIf she wanted to see people acting beautifully, she would have performed it at a soup kitchen, or a temple. Or even just in a little cul-de-sac in an average neighborhood where people know each other and kids are present. Everyday places full of totally average people who aren&#x27;t used to twisting their minds into scenarios on the ninth meta-level above reality.All she succeeded in showing is that her audience is full of people obsessed with the ugliness of humanity. reply jakelazaroff 19 hours agoparentprevHonestly flabbergasted by your reply. How did she bait anyone? How did she set herself up to be victimized? People could have just… not been violent. That would have been an entirely plausible outcome, yet here we are. reply stouset 19 hours agorootparent“She shouldn’t have been wearing those kinds of clothes if she didn’t want that to happen.” reply ADcorpo 18 hours agorootparentThank you for this comment, I had a hard time pinpointing exactly what made me feel uneasy about all those answers justifying the audience behavior or explaining that they were setup for violence because various harmful objects were present.It is indeed the same way of thinking.If you murder someone, I don&#x27;t see how you could blame them for being too close to a knife or gun. Having the opportunity to do something does not systematically justify doing it.edit: this logic does not apply even if the person brought the harmful object with them, the decision to do the harm is ultimately not made by the victim. reply peoplefromibiza 19 hours agorootparentprev> People could have just… not been violentIn Naples...?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-ilmattino-it.translate.goog&#x2F;napoli&#x2F;cronaca&#x2F;spara...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-napolivillage-com.translate.goog&#x2F;cronaca&#x2F;allaren... reply bergen 19 hours agorootparentAh yes, the infamous city of Naples, where people have been intrinsically violent and bad people for decades, because ..

If you walked into the centre of London, Sydney or NYC, setup a table which included these objects and invited the public to do whatever they wanted to you, the general outcome is fairly predictable. And the protagonists can present the profundity of their scene as insight and call it art. So, bravo them. reply skipants 17 hours agorootparentI agree. And something overlooked is that Rythym 0 isn&#x27;t an incitement for good people to do something bad; it&#x27;s inciting good people to leave.If good people pick up the roses and bad people pick up the guns, why would the good people want to stay in that environment? reply bergen 19 hours agoparentprevWhat a take. How is she exactly to blame for the way this turned out? She set the stage for SOMETHING to happen, wether good or bad things happened was completely up to the audience. To see this and say \"this is sickness\" and \"she invited people to harm here\" is baffling. You seem extremely judgemental. reply GuB-42 19 hours agorootparentShe has already performed acts of violence on herself. Acts a good part of her audience most likely has seen and appreciated, why would they go see her otherwise? And among the items were weapons and other instruments of pain. The name \"rhythm 0\" follows the same pattern as her other performances that involved self-harm.So yes, I consider it an invitation to harm her. reply GuB-42 19 hours agoparentprev> Demonstrations of human capacity for ugliness are a lot easier than revealing something beautiful.Not always. See that Acali experiement ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Acali ).To make it short: An experimenter took a bunch of people, put them a raft expecting sex and violence, instead, they became best friends. reply airstrike 18 hours agoparentprev> Demonstrations of human capacity for ugliness are a lot easier than revealing something beautiful.This almost seems like an obvious truth but most people seem oblivious to it.In the general case, I like to say that \"destroying is much easier than creating\". Sadly, for decades now, most of art (and society) has been more about the former than the latter.If anyone reading this has sources, essays, articles, books to suggest to me that touch on this issue, I am all ears reply itishappy 19 hours agoparentprevMaybe it was about more than just her? reply girament 17 hours agoprevnext [4 more] [flagged] rendall 17 hours agoparent> \"It may be your right (or not, I don&#x27;t even know).\"No. This is stealing.

Pull the trigger?The fact of the performance is that Marina Abramović presented herself and 72 objects to an audience, and did nothing more.

IMO. reply Kiro 19 hours agoparentprevI downvoted because I disagree. Simple as that, and a totally just reason to downvote.

Bullies don&#x27;t have impunity, but they carry on anyway. I think it&#x27;s much more to do with the suggestion of violence. Leaving the blank space for violence makes it huge in people&#x27;s mind. They act it out against their best interests, because it&#x27;s so tempting. If you remove the suggestion towards it at all or suggest to it and then fill the urge another way, the problem disappears. reply ajuc 19 hours agorootparentIf she didn&#x27;t say she takes responsibility - nothing would have happened.After you punish the bully the first time - usually he leaves you alone.Impunity is the important factor, not \"suggestion of violence\". reply redder23 17 hours agoprevI would love to see a video of this and know what kind of people there were in the audience.

They were being asked, implicitly, to break norms, to treat her as non-human, to get all weird in the name of Art.The idea that this says something profound about how people will &#x27;naturally gravitate&#x27; towards violent or dehumanising behaviour is ridiculous. reply capableweb 19 hours agorootparent> where the audience is requested to participate by doing &#x27;anything&#x27; to her and she won&#x27;t reactJust to be 100% clear, she never asked people to \"do anything\" nor \"I won&#x27;t react\", this is what was said to the audience&#x2F;participants: Instructions: There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.

As for \"I won&#x27;t react\", that&#x27;s obvious from the first moment someone does something to her (like moving her arms) and she just goes along with it. From then on, it becomes obbvious that it&#x27;s a game, a kind of endurance test for the artist, with the audience trying increasingly extreme things to see if she really will keep going along with it.(And of course, at any moment she could just say \"OK that&#x27;s enough, I&#x27;m stopping this early, please stop\" and it would be over - it&#x27;s not like everyone would say \"Nah, we are going to keep abusing you until 2am as originally agreed\".) reply cats_ 19 hours agorootparentprevHow are you so sure humans aren&#x27;t evil by nature? reply flkenosad 18 hours agorootparentBecause children are pure.

    "originLink": "https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom",
    "originBody": "dismiss Welcome to the new Minecraft Wiki! Migrate your accountWiki DiscordTwitterMastodon Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom Jump to navigation Jump to search After several discussions, we are excited to announce that the Minecraft Wiki has now moved from Fandom to minecraft.wiki – all of the information about the game can now be found at the new location! By moving to a new place, we are able to bring lots of improvements to the wiki. For example, here are some changes you’ll find when visiting the new wiki! A new skin! No more ugly yellow sidebar! We’ve designed a familiar yet fresh look to the wiki to make it really pop. There’s also a dark mode option (located in the top-right corner of the webpage) and a fixed width option (currently just for logged-in users under “gadgets” in your user settings). We also have a new logo to celebrate! Faster load times! Our new host has better built out infrastructure that makes the site load significantly faster than Fandom, especially in different parts of the world and with slower internet connections. This is also thanks to a cleaner website interface that doesn’t require as many resources as the Fandom website does with all its additional non-wiki features. Fewer ads! The new site won’t have popups, quizzes, unrelated articles or videos ads; only one ad at most will show up per page. Note that for the moment, there will not be any ads at all as we still work on getting the ad infrastructure fully set up. We will make sure to notify the wiki community and be as transparent as possible about the placement and selection of the ad. Improved search functionality! You might have noticed that the search results on Fandom are often less than ideal. With our move away from Fandom we’re now able to use a much more powerful and user-friendly search engine again. For example, try to find out which Java snapshot armor trims were added in by searching for “armor trim snapshot”. No more age popup! Unlike Fandom, we won’t be forcing you to tell us if you’re a child or an adult. Anonymous editing is back! You will no longer need to create an account to help improve the wiki. We need your help! Unfortunately, because Fandom does not close wikis that have moved away, the old Fandom wiki will remain in place and continue to appear in search results. The old domains “minecraft.gamepedia.com” and “minecraftwiki.net” will still redirect to the Fandom wiki as well. As such, for the new wiki to be successful, we need your help! Here are a few ways you can help out: Spread the word! Tell your friends that we’ve moved to a new place! Don’t click on Fandom links. In search results, always pick minecraft.wiki links instead of Fandom ones. This tells Google and other search engines which site is better for users. Don't use the old domains. Change any existing “minecraftwiki.net”, “minecraft.gamepedia.com”, or “minecraft.fandom.com” links to minecraft.wiki – this helps us become more established and show up higher in search results. Help improve the wiki! At the new wiki, you don’t even have to create an account to make edits! Need help with editing? Come join our Discord server and ask some questions, or check out this help page. You can also try out the Indie Wiki Buddy browser extension, which will redirect you there automatically, as well as hide the Fandom wiki on Google and other search engines. Migrating Gamepedia/Fandom accounts to the new wiki If you’d like to migrate your account to the new wiki, go to this page and follow the steps there. You’ll be prompted to input your name and verify your identity on the Fandom wiki. It should only take a few minutes. All of your previous contributions will be kept when you migrate your account. However, your user preferences (including watchlist, email, and talk page signature) unfortunately cannot be transferred and you will need to set them again. In case you have issues with this, please use this contact form or let us know on our Discord server. Who is hosting the new wiki? The new Minecraft Wiki will be hosted by Weird Gloop, the company that hosts the RuneScape wikis. There are a number of reasons why it was chosen as a host, which you can read about on the discussion page here. The long and short of it is that our new host has a minimal amount of ads, a strong set of technical infrastructure, lots of transparency, and a strong track record regarding the SEO competition with Fandom for page ranking. Weird Gloop offers us the autonomy we would get from hosting the wiki ourselves, but they also have the experience and expertise needed to set up and maintain the infrastructure behind the wiki, which we do not have ourselves. What about the non-English wikis? For the moment, only the English Minecraft Wiki has moved away from Fandom. While we are fortunate enough to be able to move, we also understand that not all language wikis are able to or wish to move as well. Some non-English wikis are also planning to move to the new location in the future. However, others have decided to stay at Fandom for now, or are still discussing whether they want to move or not. You can find out what the current position of each wiki is by checking out their respective community portals and/or Discord servers. To all the community, please respect the decisions of those who choose to stay, as we are all still a part of the Minecraft community!

    "commentBody": "DJI Mini 4 ProHacker NewspastloginDJI Mini 4 Pro (dji.com) 322 points by Foivos 14 hours ago| hidepastfavorite351 comments ben7799 13 hours agoI&#x27;ve had the original Mini since it came out.Other than damaging a prop from it hitting a blade of grass on landing it is in perfect shape. Yes, they are so fragile I landed very smoothly in the grass and soft grass is enough to damage the props!I don&#x27;t fly it as much as I used to. These new ones are certainly an engineering marvel with how much they have added and still kept it under 249g.The big one to me though is the wind resistance. 10.7m&#x2F;s is 23mph. The original specs 17mph. It is hard to say at which point it starts having trouble, but 23mph is a non-trivial improvement, it probably means 2x as many days you can actually fly.Now the things that suck about DJI, and I wonder if they are actually at all improved with a new drone:- Geofencing sometimes locks you out of legal flights, no way around that unless you can jailbreak- Some legal flights require you going through an unlock process, and if the DJI web infrastructure is having a bad day you also get locked out of flying in a legal placeI would probably buy from another competitor, especially a US one, just over the unlock experience with DJI. reply dreamcompiler 10 hours agoparentI&#x27;d like to find a good competitor too, and not just because of the geofencing. DJI has been identified as a national security threat by the US DOD, essentially because there&#x27;s no way to be sure that every second of GPS-tagged video shot by a DJI drone isn&#x27;t going into a giant server farm owned by the Chinese intelligence service.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defense.gov&#x2F;News&#x2F;Releases&#x2F;Release&#x2F;Article&#x2F;270608... reply MichaelApproved 10 hours agorootparent> there&#x27;s no way to be sure that every second of GPS-tagged video shot by a DJI drone isn&#x27;t going into a giant server farm owned by the Chinese intelligence service.I checked your source and it didn’t back up this claim.I’m not a networking specialist but isn’t it possible to detect if something is transmitting a massive amount of data (such as video) to an undetermined destination?seems like this type of blatant data export would be easy to detect and subsequently ban the device doing it.I’m just a simple software developer, so the network stuff can go over my head sometimes (heh), but the claim that such a large amount of data is being transmitted in a way that couldn’t be confirmed enough to ban the product seems dubious. reply ngcc_hk 9 hours agorootparentYou do not need to transmit the video first. But coordinate or interested person. Even a sport watch can be a security threat as demo by some exercise army personnel. They just know who and when and where these places are.For the transfer part it is much harder as said and easier to detect in peace time.But then what happen in war or proxy-war time. You have to know how many senior Russians are killed by using a phone … reply 1024core 9 hours agorootparent> Even a sport watch can be a security threat as demo by some exercise army personnel.In the early days of the Afghan (or was it Iraq?) war, people used Strava to figure out the locations of American bases. They&#x27;d see a bunch of smart watches suddenly wake up in the morning and start exercising at the same time, a dead giveaway. reply Bimos 8 hours agorootparentRecently a Russian commander got killed because he shared his daily running route on Strava which was seen by the killer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;11&#x2F;europe&#x2F;russian-submarine-... reply cjbgkagh 6 hours agorootparentI wonder if killing their dumber commanders might inadvertently be helping them… reply hackernewds 5 hours agorootparentwhat a strange argument to make reply ethbr1 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s fair, but they&#x27;ve been working on improving the quality of their officers since 1904. reply eps 2 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t know if you were attempting to make a joke, but Stalin purged the army of older, most qualified officers in the late 1930s, because they came from the pre-revolution times and were viewed as a loyalty risk. One of his biggest blunders that severely disadvantaged the country when the WW2 started. reply vetinari 55 minutes agorootparentMany white-era officers did serve in the Red Army; including Zhukov and his ex-boss Rokossovskij. Being a cadre in pre-revolution times wasn&#x27;t the issue itself; willingness to sabotage their own country was.Incidentally, the blunder in the 1941 in the Red Army was an issue of loyalty indeed. Navy didn&#x27;t experience the same problem. replyballs187 4 hours agorootparentprevNeither. The US’ wars in both places predate general availability “smart” devices by quite some time.There were devices like black berries and tmobile sidekick, and gps trackers from garmin (etc) but I think the incidents you were referring to happened much later (2018 vs 2001&#x2F;2002). reply cookieswumchorr 1 hour agorootparentbut the us only left Afganistan two years ago reply ezconnect 3 hours agorootparentprevThe issue with the watch is the data is publicly available (social aspect) and requires no effort on the other side to figure out. reply spacebanana7 1 hour agorootparentprevI believe the incident you’re referring to happened in 2018 [1].Also happened across a few American bases across Syria, Yemen, Niger, Afghanistan, Djibouti and more. Some British and Russian bases were highlighted too.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-42853072 reply aynyc 10 hours agorootparentprevGiven the volume of data, they can just box up the hard drives and ship via container ships or planes. reply noknownsender 9 hours agorootparentI assume he means at the device level. reply MichaelApproved 9 hours agorootparentI did. Thanks! reply RhodesianHunter 2 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know how DJI works, but presumably it ships the video out to a service that you then log in to to view?If so, it&#x27;s on their servers and there&#x27;s no \"networking\" you can do to know whether they forwarded it on from there. reply MichaelApproved 5 minutes agorootparentIf that’s true then you’re right but I don’t know if that’s true.abacadaba 8 hours agorootparentprevAlso a national security threat because they&#x27;re game changing weapons and they make the most and best of them. reply ramraj07 4 hours agorootparentBest because of the price not the performance. Though the outrageousness of the black hornet drone costing 200K is too much. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flymotionus.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;flirs-black-hornet-is-the... reply baybal2 6 hours agorootparentprev> identified as a national security threat by the US DOD, essentially because there&#x27;s no way to be sure that every second of GPS-tagged video shot by a DJI drone isn&#x27;t going into a giant server farm owned by the Chinese intelligence service.There are far more obvious reasons for that. These drones are of enormous military value. By buying them, US consumers are funding an obvious foreign military hardware production. US money may well be funding production of drones which may once be used to correct artillery strikes on Los Angeles.DJI are particular seem to work in concert with \"military civilian fusion,\" and have hardware, and software to defeat both very serious jamming, and attempts to fry its radio with pulsed microwaves. Military jammers for 2.4g band seemingly have near 0 effect. reply sorokod 4 hours agorootparent>US money may well be funding production ...This statement would be correct for any product of Chinese origin - no? reply bonestamp2 4 hours agorootparentYes, and these drones would be a drop in the bucket compared to everything else bought from China. reply ezconnect 3 hours agorootparentprevJammers don&#x27;t have much effect because of the frequency hopping technology of 2.4ghz band used by hobbyist has been improved upon for years. We used to have flags and announce use frequency during the FM days, now we just go out and race without worrying about interference with other users. reply onethought 9 hours agorootparentprevThat release is about using DJI drones in government and military installations. There is not a suggestion that DJI is being used to do wide spread civilian spying.Meanwhile in the US... reply kaptainscarlet 4 hours agoparentprevI think it&#x27;s a good thing the props are fragile as the motor would be damaged if the props hit an object without absorbing the force of impact. reply qup 1 hour agorootparenthaha, check out freestyle fpv. you won&#x27;t believe what the motors can survive. reply theshrike79 1 hour agoparentprevI think I paid 300€ for a Mini Fly More Combo slightly used (under 10 hours or flight time according to the drone).It&#x27;s a fun toy, but can&#x27;t stand the wind at all, so it&#x27;s a bit nerve wracking to fly it over open water if it&#x27;s not completely calm :DI really do want the Mini 4 Pro, but can&#x27;t justify the 1000€+ price tag with the proper controller. reply pedrovhb 8 hours agoparentprevI had the original mini too. Really fun, but mine is RIP in the water under a waterfall ravine. It&#x27;s hard to say whether it was a GPS bug, a gust of wind, or just my own fault, but as I was shooting a video next to some rock walls, it went towards the rocks and I couldn&#x27;t get it back. After the first hit it tumbled and hit some vegetation, and then it went all the way down, no way to recover.It&#x27;s a good thing the new ones have collision avoidance, it could likely have saved mine back then. I&#x27;ll someday get one of the newer ones, it was pretty fun and an impressive piece of engineering. Sometimes I think to myself \"this would be a really great shot with the drone\", or wish I had it to scout some terrain ahead when hiking or exploring. It&#x27;s a pretty cool gadget! reply ChatGTP 6 hours agorootparentMy friend was flying his, lost it and asked it to fly back to him and it went absolutely full speed into a waterfall about 10 meters in front of us.It was hard not to chuckle.RIP. reply bennyelv 3 hours agoparentprev> The big one to me though is the wind resistance. 10.7m&#x2F;s is 23mph. The original specs 17mph. It is hard to say at which point it starts having trouble, but 23mph is a non-trivial improvement, it probably means 2x as many days you can actually fly.That’s a huge one for me as well (also own a mini). I live near the sea and the number of days you can actually fly is surprisingly low. 23mph is still pretty low, but I understand the weight vs windspeed tradeoff. reply roshin 10 hours agoparentprevDo you have a recommendation of a drone with similar features that doesn&#x27;t require jailbreaking? reply bri3d 10 hours agorootparentAutel drones tend to fall around a generation behind DJI&#x27;s in terms of capability, and they don&#x27;t have geofencing. Unfortunately, they are much more expensive like-for-like and if you are also concerned about China, they share the same China-problems.There are no US or European drones that really come close, unfortunately. Parrot are 2-3+ generations behind DJI in terms of capability: wireless link, camera, and even basic flight stability are all quite a distance behind. Skydio had unique autonomy capabilities which were really cool but were a long way behind in controller capability, camera, and wireless tech and exited the consumer market.Honestly, DJI no-fly zones in the US are not too onerous in my opinion - most of the places that are banned probably should be banned. I would recommend a DJI drone with a standalone remote (to avoid needing to install DJI apps on your phone). However, generally speaking in Europe their no fly zones are more restrictive and can be quite frustrating. reply qchris 9 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s also worth pointing out that DJI&#x27;s first-party app isn&#x27;t required to operate many of their drones. Most of their drones, apart from all but the most recent (i.e. the one this announcement is about probably won&#x27;t have support for a while, but the previous gen will) has support through apps like Litchi and Dronelink via the developer API, which have additional features and don&#x27;t have the exact same permissions&#x2F;data requirements as DJI&#x27;s first-party apps.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flylitchi.com&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dronelink.com&#x2F; reply JoBrad 8 hours agorootparentTIL. Thanks! reply mlindner 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve heard good things about Skydio. reply pinkorchid 8 hours agorootparentThey have discontinued their consumer products sadly: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skydio.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;skydio-to-sunset-consumer-drone-... reply FpUser 7 hours agorootparentYup.

We just don&#x27;t have any viable way to replace fossil fuels entirely, so we will have to use less energy (and hence degrow, hopefully in a controlled and smart way).Space travel is a joke. We need fundamentally new physics if the hope is to go live in another solar system, and I don&#x27;t understand why people are excited about the idea of surviving in a spaceship.

How is the biodiversity in Los Angeles? How big are the areas affected by SpaceX launch facilities compared to the area affected by Los Angeles?Furthermore, SpaceX&#x27;s newest rocket burns methane. That means that it is creating a market for a potent greenhouse gas, that is often otherwise just vented to atmosphere as a byproduct of oil extraction.

You can&#x27;t get the full bandwidth at the maximum distance, but you might see enough to navigate.Communicating with a drone up in the sky is easier than something like your WiFi or your cell phone because you have a nice, clear line of sight to the drone. Fly behind a hill, building, or some trees at distance and the drone will lose connection and go into safety mode.The free space path loss at 20kM is 126dB at 2.4GHz in perfect conditions, or 134dB at 5.8GHz. If you start with the 1 Watt nominally allowed by regulations, that&#x27;s +30dBm. Subtract 126dB and you&#x27;re left with -96dBm. That&#x27;s a weak signal, but it&#x27;s actually close to the receive sensitivity of the WiFi card in your laptop, believe it or not. I would guess the DJI gear uses narrower channels than WiFi to achieve a better noise floor than the 20MHz (or wider) channels you get with WiFi.The 20km figure is really an extreme upper limit.

On the one end you have MOAR PWER and on the other end you have signals analysis and robust codecs (? I&#x27;m not sure \"codec\" is right. Maybe encoding? Can someone answer this?) that allow for lost information. The signals analysis will clean the incoming signal and the codec&#x2F;encoding will allow for robust recreation of the captured data.Most wireless transmission technology lives somewhere in-between the extremes of the above spectrum.

More importantly, one should fly responsibly regardless of the details of the law. Which is a bit like driving a car, or doing anything really.In London, you need to have a drone license and be registered as a drone operator. I have both of those. You&#x27;re meant to ask permission from the port authority to fly over the Thames, but I think more importantly, you&#x27;re not allowed to fly drones west of Tower Bridge, which is why that video is shot from the east.I don&#x27;t think the rules of sensible drone operation are yet (if they ever can be) neatly codified as law, and I have also observed a significant mismatch between what&#x27;s written and how those rules are enforced.

It&#x27;s still very much a \"hobby\" hobby. You can get some ready to fly kits, but even then it can wind up more technical than you expect.2. They&#x27;re spec&#x27;d for the niche market, meaning quite powerful and very short fly times, which is a shame. One of my favorite drones is the Potensic A 20.

    "originLink": "https://rocket9labs.com/post/its-time-to-let-go-apache-software-foundation/",
    "originBody": "ROCKET 9 LABS HOME POSTS PROJECTS DONATE It's time to let go, Apache Software Foundation 2023-09-25opinion The Apache Software Foundation offers a suite of office productivity software named Apache Open Office. Based on the download page, you would never guess the last major release of the software was made available in 2014. With that bit of release history in mind, would it be fair to consider Apache Open Office as an un-maintained project? In this blog post, I share a quick recap of the history behind Apache Open Office, and my opinion on why The Apache Software Foundation’s actions may be masking the answer to this question. In the beginning, StarOffice was created A proprietary office suite was developed in 1985 by a company named Star Division, aptly named StarOffice. The SUN shined, and OpenOffice.org was released In the year 2000, Sun Microsystems released the source code of StarOffice for free. This resulted in the first release of OpenOffice.org the following year. LibreOffice joins the party LibreOffice was first released in 2010 based on the OpenOffice.org source code. LibreOffice is actively maintained by The Document Foundation, a non-profit created by members of the OpenOffice.org community for the express purpose of managing and developing LibreOffice. Oracle gives OpenOffice.org to The Apache Software Foundation Oracle, having acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, now owned the OpenOffice.org trademarks. The year following the acquisition, Oracle provided the OpenOffice.org trademarks and any related Oracle-owned code to The Apache Software Foundation. This resulted in the creation of Apache Open Office. Apache Open Office dies, and refuses to leave Between its first release with version 3.4 in 2012, and its last major release with version 4.1 in 2014, Apache Open Office integrated IBM Lotus Symphony, after it was donated to The Apache Software Foundation, added a reworked sidebar and some other new features, as documented in the 4.1 release notes. Since 2014… Bug fixes, dictionary updates, bug fixes, dictionary updates, whitespace “fixes”, dictionary updates, dictionary updates and did I mention dictionary updates!? Things start to get weird You might want to sit down before opening the next link. Take a look at the apache/openoffice commits made over the last several years. What do we find? A lot of commits that don’t actually amount to much at all. In many cases, the commits don’t even make any change to the program, because they are only changing the blank space that surrounds the source code. Why would someone do this? Two possible reasons: There are legitimate whitespace issues that need to be addressed. There is an incentive to make a project appear as though it were active, when it is actually inactive. While the first is fair to assume in most cases, when we look at the list of commits made to the repository, we find that whitespace changes are not just part of the commits that Apache Open Office has been receiving, whitespace changes make up a substantial amount of the commits added to the repository. Projects become unmaintained every day. This is a fact of life, and is not the issue I am taking with The Apache Software Foundation. It is the way the foundation, and its contributors, do not disclose information relating to the lack of substantial updates or changes for nearly a decade, and seems to intentionally mask the lack of development. What we can do about it We can tell The Apache Software Foundation that we, as a community of users, do not support the foundation’s actions in regard to their management of Apache Open Office. If this blog post motivated you, send an email to apache@apache.org saying something along the lines of: To whom it may concern, Apache Open Office has not received substantial updates nor changes in nearly a decade, yet there is no mention of this anywhere on the download page. In the best interest of the community, please consider mentioning this information, as well as providing a link for users to download other actively maintained office software. The Apache Open Office GitHub repository receives regular commits, but these changes seem to largely be whitespace-only. This gives the impression that the repository is more active than it really is, as non-substantial changes seem to make up a large number of the commits added. Please archive the repository if active development has ceased.

It is heartbreaking in some ways, they became the stewards for a lot of interesting projects [1]. And the venerable web server was so important to the early web. I am still running Apache vhosts on a few personal websites.It is also a totally unfair characterization. I mean, they still house relevant projects including Kafka, Lucene, Zookeeper, Spark, Arrow and many others.But it does feel Apache lives in a kind of stasis, a relic of the \"old\" web, like geocities sites or MySpace. If a project ends up in Apache it feels to me like it has gone out to pasture.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.apache.org&#x2F;projects.html reply brand 18 hours agoparentIt seems that “younger generation” programmers underestimate the value of governance in OSS. The recent Terraform kerluffle couldn’t have happened if Terraform was in the ASF, etc. reply softwaredoug 17 hours agorootparentAgreed... We are seeing dozens of database companies turn their OSS into basically proprietary shared code licenses. And we seem to still pretend its \"open source\"Collaboration, across companies, not ownership by one company is the root of open source. To do that you need some kind of governance model. Essentially \"ownership\" by one company is conducive to quick progress on specific problems, but not collaboration. reply AceJohnny2 16 hours agorootparentTo put it another way: many startups today have adopted the \"Open Core\" business model, and it&#x27;s really more about marketing than actual open-source.\"Open Core\" means they open-source the core of their product portfolio, core which some enterprising people may use to develop applications on, but for others will really need the buy into the rest of the portfolio to get the best use out of. reply AceJohnny2 16 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t really fault companies for using this model. Development is expensive, and business models around open-source are hard. I mean, just look at what Red Hat ends up doing to fend off copycats. Getting people to try your product and also rely on it is a tricky proposition. reply softwaredoug 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t fault them either. In fact I&#x27;m a big fan of many of those companies.I think the fault is with the consumers. Many companies consume but do not participate in open source. All the incentives are there for companies to become vendors rather than participants (stewards?) of an open source project. reply soenkeliebau 14 hours agorootparentI think we are heading towards a bit of a shift in this regard. With the CRA in Europe and similar legislation in the States it will become more important to have \"enterprise\" services surrounding open source software. This is for example support, but also vulnerability assessment and similar things.I may be mistaken here, but I think we will see pure functionality become less important to enterprise customers, which might (maybe not, but one can hope) proper open source business models more viable again. reply falalalala 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat does Debian do? reply AceJohnny2 11 hours agorootparentDebian is not a commercial entity. It&#x27;s a volunteer organization.In fact there&#x27;s been quite a bit of vitriol about Canonical (company behind Ubuntu) profiting (for what that&#x27;s worth) from all the hard work from Debian volunteers and not sharing as much of that value back to Debian as was felt was deserved. reply worthless-trash 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve always wondered about that, I feel like ubuntu sometimes doesn&#x27;t contribute fixes upstream. When I hear &#x27;it works on ubuntu but not on distro X&#x27;, it makes me wonder why ubuntu devs didnt post the fixes upstream.* I do realise that different release timings can fudge with the timing, but when fedora is building upstream versions and I hear it, its a bit.. disheartening. replypclmulqdq 17 hours agorootparentprevThe flipside is that companies don&#x27;t seem all that interested in this sort of collaboration, though, nor should they be. It doesn&#x27;t really make sense for a company that believes its edge is its technology to both give up the secret sauce and accept the dillution of that edge that comes from taking code from outside contributors. The modern version of \"open source\" is a natural evolution of the concept when this is how companies think. reply znpy 16 hours agorootparentprev> We are seeing dozens of database companies turn their OSS into basically proprietary shared code licenses. And we seem to still pretend its \"open source\"\"open source\" here is working as intended. the thing is, \"open source\" is misunderstood by many (most?) individuals.\"open source\" was explicitly created by Eric Raymond and others in the late 90ies because the Free Software movement was seen as too extremistic by companies still deeply rooted into the proprietary model.\"open source\" is a nice way out, in order to be able to look cool, while not actually playing it cool.I said it in many posts and i&#x27;ll say it again: if you&#x27;re require to give up copyright on your contributions and the license isn&#x27;t free-software... then it&#x27;s just a matter of time before a company turns your code into proprietary intellectual property.people that do not agree are simply delusional (or okay with that). reply ptx 16 hours agorootparentWell, sort of. Open source was just a different name to describe free software, with the purpose of emphasizing the collaboration benefits this gives the business rather than the freedom it gives users. But this \"business source\" stuff is a different thing which is not open source at all. reply mixmastamyk 16 hours agorootparentNot just different names but different licenses. reply ptx 15 hours agorootparentNo, not really. The first three criteria of the Open Source Definition [0] are essentially freedoms 1–3 of the Free Software Definition [1] and freedom 0 more or less maps to criteria 5 and 6.The mainstream FOSS licenses (GPL, BSD, Apache2, etc.) are all included both in the official list of open source licenses [2] and the official list of free software licenses [3], so these licenses are both open source licenses and free software licenses. These lists might have some minor differences, but they share a substantial subset and the definitions broadly speaking define the same thing.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;osd&#x2F;[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;free-sw.html[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;license-list.en.html reply toyg 14 hours agorootparentYou can&#x27;t interpret things like these out of context.OSS as a term was created at a time when free software, as defined by GNU, was effectively becoming the de-facto standard for collaborative efforts on the internet. Yes, MIT and BSD were around (barely, in the BSD case), but the rising star was Linux and Linux (and the software built on it - GTK, gimp, etc) was GPL.The industry needed a way to get on the action without touching the \"communist\" GPL, and that&#x27;s why ESR&#x27;s definition of \"Open Source\" was endorsed. Obviously they coopted all the existing bits they were ok with (i.e. all the ones that did not impose any extra burden on companies), that&#x27;s why the definitions overlap substantially; but they are not the same thing. If they were, there would not have been any need to create a new definition for it. reply ptx 11 hours agorootparentOut of context? I provided plenty of context if you care to follow the links I posted.The distinction between copyleft and non-copyleft licenses, e.g. GPL and BSD, is different from the distinction between open source and free software, which is mainly ideological. The GPL is a copyleft license but also an open source license, as you can see on the OSI website.For maximum context, here is a quote from the board meeting minutes [0] where the OSI approved the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s copyleft GPL license as an open source license in accordance with the Open Source Definition: \"The Open Source Initiative is pleased to announce that, based on broad review and acceptance by both the Board and the community, it has confirmed that GPLv3 and LGPLv3 both conform to the Open Source Definition.\"[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;meeting-minutes&#x2F;minutes20070905&#x2F; reply toyg 3 hours agorootparentYes, because OSS was meant to be a superset of projects including Free Software, so that stuff that did not fit the Free Software definition could still be considered ideologically acceptable. Do I really have to draw a diagram...? reply znpy 12 hours agorootparentprev> The industry needed a way to get on the action without touching the \"communist\" GPL, and that&#x27;s why ESR&#x27;s definition of \"Open Source\" was endorsed.which against, doesn&#x27;t really makes sense.Stallman has repeated over and over that the Free Software movement is not about communism (despite what communist people like to say).Most likely, the industry needed a way to get people to submit improvements and patches (essentially doing Development, QA and support) for free without having to give a way the right to sell proprietary services. reply znpy 15 hours agorootparentprevIn this contexts license is everything, I can’t understand why people won’t get this in their head. reply znpy 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat you’re saying doesn’t make sense at all.If that was true that would have been just some marketing campaign.There would have been no need to divert the attention from the free software foundation. reply ptx 14 hours agorootparentYes, basically a marketing campaign. Wikipedia [0] says (in part): \"Netscape&#x27;s act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring free software principles and benefits to the commercial-software industry. They concluded that FSF&#x27;s social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the free software movement to emphasize the business potential of the sharing of source code.\"In other words, we had a thing that would benefit everyone in many ways, but some people didn&#x27;t like the marketing message of \"users deserve these rights!\" so a complementary marketing message of \"cheaper and higher-quality software through collaboration!\" was needed to reach that group.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_free_and_open-sourc... replylondons_explore 15 hours agorootparentprev> value of governance in OSSYou are assuming that a strict and stable governance model is good for OSS.But often it is the least stable projects with lots of hostile forks and huge mailing list arguments which turn out to be the most successful projects.Strict and stable governance model is perhaps dull and turns away contributors who feel they will never get to the top of such a stable project with long timelines and complex procedures for everything. reply softwaredoug 15 hours agorootparent\"Strict and stable\" isn&#x27;t quite the important feature, its being community-managed. Chaotic projects with lots of forks, and disorganized governance may be a sign that there is a strong community. If the chaos goes on forever, then you&#x27;re going to probably lose people to the drama (or the forks themselves will eventually stabilize). If the chaos is short, spasmatic, and leads to a better outcome, then it was overall a good thing in the project&#x27;s governance. reply londons_explore 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s the difference between:> \"Ask bob on discord and he&#x27;ll give you commit access to the repo\"and:> \"First you need to fill out the CLA and send 3 pull requests before you can then apply for committer access at the bi-monthly steering group committee. Present your case in an email to them at least 28 days beforehand, and make sure an existing committer seconds it\" reply TylerE 14 hours agorootparentprevThere are things people argue over, and things no one cares about. reply hodgesrm 7 hours agorootparentprevCan you give a couple examples of such projects? reply pjmlp 15 hours agorootparentprevGovernance alone doesn&#x27;t help, if there isn&#x27;t a way to pay the bills.It was cool to be a UNIX&#x2F;FOSS zealot during the late 90&#x27;s while still getting monetary support.Writing M$ on the email signature and such.Eventually I had to find a way to pay my bills. reply raxxorraxor 36 minutes agorootparentIn the current market you reliably can do both. Nobody in software can deny the importance of open source software, if only for learning or training. Without FOSS, there would only be stagnation.You can even develop commercial software and still support FOSS. This isn&#x27;t some think the kids of the 90s do. Most new open source projects are created by younger developers. reply zoogeny 17 hours agorootparentprevThere is a quote: \"When you stop growing you start dying\" (William S. Burroughs). I am not sure I believe that the kind of governance that Apache is providing is helping to grow the projects under its supervision.Your comparison to Terraform is also interesting. Apache Kafka, for example, has been absorbed by Amazon (MSK). Apache Spark is Amazon EMR. Just looking through Amazon&#x27;s paid service offering I find several Apache projects rebranded and for sale. A cynical take could be that Apache is an org that helps companies like Amazon profit off of the work of open source developers. reply JohnFen 17 hours agorootparentBut with software, sometimes there comes a time when it really should stop growing. When any further \"enhancements\" make the software worse.It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve seen countless times in my life. A piece of software achieves something pretty close to perfection for its task, but the self-imposed \"need\" to continue development on it ruins it. reply rzzzt 17 hours agorootparentDoes it read mail and&#x2F;or contain a subset of Common Lisp? reply worthless-trash 5 hours agorootparentAll software will eventually grow to send email. And lets be honest, if its not written in lisp, are you really trying ? reply systems_glitch 17 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely. Some things go into bugfix-only mode because their code has reached perfection for the 99% use case. reply broeng 16 hours agorootparentAnd then we fear it&#x27;s a dead project, and move on in search for something else with active contributors. reply JohnFen 16 hours agorootparentCertainly not everyone. Personally, I pay little attention to that sort of thing at all. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a \"dead\" project or not -- as long as the software is meeting my needs, that&#x27;s the only thing that matters. If&#x2F;when it stops doing that, then I&#x27;ll look for alternatives. reply AlbertCory 15 hours agorootparentprevHot take: Python 3.Totally unnecessary. reply Master_Odin 14 hours agorootparentThe move to python 3 helped shake loose a number of text processing bugs with library I work on, that was never caught in python 2 with its loose goosy text type handling. reply JohnFen 13 hours agorootparentBut as an end user, it&#x27;s made using applications based on (or even tangentially using, as I learned first-hand a couple of months ago) Python highly problematic due to extreme version incompatibility.I now try my best to avoid anything that involves Python. reply janoc 13 hours agorootparentSorry but that&#x27;s nonsense. Python 3 has been released in 2008 - 15 years ago. And the last Python 2 version has been EOLed 1.1.2020, three years ago, after a decade of deprecation!With your argument about compatibility no programming language would ever be able to evolve or deprecate&#x2F;remove some features. Look at how many things changed e.g. between recent C++, Rust or C# major releases. Python had only one major revision in 15 years in comparison!If you are using software that still requires Python 2 that&#x27;s very much a problem of that application and not Python. Complain to the vendor responsible, not about Python. They had ample time to update their code.End users had no business touching Python 2 for at least a decade now. And upward compatibility between the point releases of Python is (and has been) generally pretty good. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparent> Sorry but that&#x27;s nonsense.I&#x27;m not lying. This problem cost me a full weekend earlier this year. I may have misremembered the exact version numbers, though. Perhaps it wasn&#x27;t between 2 and 3. Is there a Python 4?The problem is that you can&#x27;t have one Python interpreter that covers all versions of Python, and Python is very unforgiving about using the wrong interpreter version.In any case, it was a serious problem that cost me a lot of time and really soured me on Python as an end user. I&#x27;ve not encountered a similar issue with any other language before, so this appears to be uniquely a Python thing.But I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m happy enough to just avoid Python-based anything whenever possible now. reply janoc 12 hours agorootparentThere is no Python 4 - and may not ever be.If you have downloaded Python 2, you must have done it intentionally, it isn&#x27;t even available from the Python.org website download anymore - and had not been for a long time.>The problem is that you can&#x27;t have one Python interpreter that covers all versions of Python, and Python is very unforgiving about using the wrong interpreter version.Because it doesn&#x27;t make sense. The language evolves. Nobody is going to stop working on it only because it could break some old code somewhere. The changes from 2 to 3 happened *15 years ago*.There is no reason to try to compile&#x2F;run old Python 2 code today - and if you still do need it for some reason, then you need to download the Python 2 version (which are still available, if you need them but one has to look for them). But then you better know what you are doing.If some old code requires Python 2, any somewhat experienced Python developer will spot that right away (e.g. the use of print statement in Python 2 vs. print() function in Python 3 is a dead giveaway).>In any case, it was a serious problem that cost me a lot of time and really soured me on Python as an end user. I&#x27;ve not encountered a similar issue with any other language before, so this appears to be uniquely a Python thing.I don&#x27;t doubt it has costed you a lot of time but this was a problem entirely of your own doing by not doing your homework.You would have exactly the same problems if you tried to compile old K&R C code or C++ code from 20 years ago using modern compilers. Or tried to feed modern C# code to a compiler from 10 years ago. Or, God forbid, tried to run some modern Javascript code using old browser - or that old HTML with Flash and what not in a modern browser ...Python is actually much more lenient in this regard because a major language change has happened only once, 15 years ago, with Python 2 being deprecated for well over a decade. The point releases are all upward compatible with no issues. reply jen20 8 hours agorootparentI’m with you on Python 2 to 3 being a fine idea and an improvement but…> You would have exactly the same problems if you tried to compile old K&R C code or C++ code from 20 years ago using modern compilers. Or tried to feed modern C# code to a compiler from 10 years ago.If you feed 10 year old C# to a modern compiler it will compile it fine. I’d imagine most C and C++ of even 20-year vintage will still compile. The issue is of forward compatibility, not backwards. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentNo it won&#x27;t, as it might be using the breaking for change introduced in C# 5, or .NET Framework features not made available on .NET Core.Likewise C and C++ have had enough breaking changes since 2010. reply AlbertCory 12 hours agorootparentprevall arguably true, but it has no bearing on whether 3 was necessary in the first place.> With your argument about compatibility no programming language would ever be able to evolve\"evolve\" and \"change\" are not ends in themselves. If it was usable as it was, then there was no need to evolve or change in an incompatible way.15 years ago: also irrelevant. World War One was unnecessary, and that was 109 years ago. Whatever issues existed are sorted out by now, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it had to happen. reply janoc 12 hours agorootparentThere have been some very good reasons why Python 3 made those changes.That you find them unnecessary because the original code was \"usable as is\" for you is irrelevant.The reasons why these changes have been done (for a developer they have been fairly minor) has been hashed and rehashed for the past 15 years, Guido van Rossum wrote on it extensively too.Most has been performance-related (Python 3 is significantly faster than 2) and probably the biggest user-visible change is the clean up of string handling with everything being Unicode now.Frankly, anyone complaining about this stuff today is just beating the old dead horse for the sake of having something to complain about. The same like some people constantly bringing up the Linux systemd discussions after more than a decade, even though they are completely irrelevant today. reply AlbertCory 10 hours agorootparentthe age of an unnecessary change is irrelevant. Here&#x27;s your sequence:1. It&#x27;s not true2. It&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s not important3. It&#x27;s true, and it&#x27;s important, but we&#x27;re tired of talking about it. replyrbowen 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m fascinated at your characterization of both Kafka and Spark as being absorbed by Amazon.AWS offers hosted versions of each. They are not, as you say \"rebranded and for sale\", but rather are hosted services, running whatever upstream releases.But to say that the project as been absorbed by AWS (in either case) is simply false. Spark is developed by a community of numerous companies, of which Databricks is usually most prominent. Kafka is likewise a community of several organizations, of which Confluent tends to be the most influential.Yes, Apache is (and always has been) business-friendly. The license enables companies to profit on those projects. But, for the most part, companies that benefit from those project also contribute back to them, as a way to ensure sustainability.

Or at the very least brand them differently. reply rbowen 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s important to note that the ASF did say no to Wave. It never made it out of the Incubator, because it was unable to build an active user community. reply mindcrime 15 hours agorootparentAnd in addition, simply by virtue of going through the Incubator at all, these projects ensure that the source code is available under a well known, well understood, popular, ALv2 license - and the code, email archives, and other artifacts that were created are preserved by the ASF even when the project is sent to the Attic. This is still a net good for the world in general, IMO.And while it&#x27;s not exactly common there have been forks of Attic&#x27;d projects outside of the ASF that went on to be useful to people. reply jacoblambda 17 hours agorootparentprevBut are they web scale?

Apache should have a marker for zombie projects so people don&#x27;t start using them. reply rbowen 16 hours agorootparentThe ASF does have a marker for retired projects. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;attic.apache.org&#x2F;Software projects have a natural lifecycle, and since we&#x27;ve been around for almost 30 years, there&#x27;s going to be a number of projects in that state.However, the ASF doesn&#x27;t force projects into the attic while they still have a community around them. OpenOffice is an edge case - there&#x27;s still a project community, primarily around templates and other end-user-centric activities. They&#x27;re just not doing much with the actual software any more.Granted, there&#x27;s room to disagree as to whether 1) the ASF should force projects into the attic and 2) whether OO actually has an active community. But the Foundation&#x27;s position is that this is the decision of the project, not one to be forced top-down by the Board. reply pavon 16 hours agorootparentprevThey do have the Apache Attic for that purpose, but they typically defer to the project maintainers to make the decision to retire a project, unless there are no longer any maintainers. reply giamma 17 hours agorootparentprevWell, the same would hold for github or any other open source container.When I find something interesting on github, before deciding to use it, I check the number of committers and the commit history&#x2F;frequency.Anyone can do the same for Apache projects. reply renegade-otter 17 hours agorootparentGitHub is an unfiltered firehose.

The original OO community largely went with LibreOffice. They did not like the interference of Oracle and later IBM in their project&#x27;s governance. So, Apache got the trademarks from Oracle and a community of people who were largely not maintainers. This put Apache, almost from day one, in position to be competing with the community of one of their own projects. reply geertj 16 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;ve felt for a long time (maybe even a decade) that Apache is the place OSS goes to retire&#x2F;die.It&#x27;s a bit too strong as others have pointed out that there are very active projects under the Apache umbrella. But I do feel that there&#x27;s a core of truth in this. Specifically, Apache does appear to provide a \"way out\" for large enterprise customers that want to dump non-strategic (to them) code somewhere and not necessarily invest in it. Seems something that could be solvable on the ASF side by having additional criteria before accepting projects, and maybe require a certain level of activity for continued membership. reply JoshuaRogers 13 hours agoparentprevAt work I&#x27;ve lovingly but sadly referred to Apache as the \"Crazy Cat Lady of Software.\" From the outside it looks like they&#x27;re willing to take on any project that someone wants to give away regardless of whether they have the capacity to provide maintenance &#x2F; governance of it themselves.While I do love the preservation aspect of it, seeing that a project is maintained by Apache rings the same \"Sure, but is the project already dead\" bells in my head that I hear when I see a project from Google.

The name is better than LibreOffice, and the fact that a grossly outdated version of OpenOffice is what people will be finding is detrimental to the project. Most the developers and the code have moved on, but the name and a bunch of old code lives on with ASF for no good reason. Seriously there is NO reason for it except the completely selfish (and harmful to others) excuse that ASF can claim to be the stewards of OpenOffice. In my dystopian imaginary world they are even paid to maintain this situation to prevent more widespread adoption of LibreOffice. reply taylorbuley 16 hours agorootparentprevThankfully, yes.

It provides a process and a place, and gives projects autonomy. The project, not the foundation, decides to keep running the project. So to characterize the ASF as \"kicking this can down the road\" for some kind of inscrutable motivation is just not how things work.The members of the OO project want to keep running their project. They have a group of people who keep showing up to do user support, documentation, and produce a huge community around their templates. They just haven&#x27;t pushed any new features for a while. But they still are there, keeping the lights on.The ASF is not a top-down organization. It&#x27;s driven entirely by those projects. And if you look at the dev list - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.apache.org&#x2F;list.html?dev@openoffice.apache.org - you&#x27;ll note that this issue gets raised on a VERY regular basis, and the project participants always say \"no thanks.\"As to \"making a deal with LibreOffice\", I would encourage you to read the mailing list, where that, too, gets raised with great regularity.

It&#x27;s just a fake 501(c)(3) which actually runs like a 501(c)(6) -- which serves corporate interests, and it should be shutdown. All their projects are just about serving corporations instead of the public good, as legally required under the tax code for this organization. reply TRiG_Ireland 17 hours agoparent> It&#x27;s just a fake 501(c)(3) which actually runs like a 501(c)(6).Not everyone is familiar with the nuances of your country&#x27;s tax codes. Would you care to interpret that? reply Kon-Peki 17 hours agorootparentA 501(c)(3) is a non-profit organization that exists to serve the public good. A 501(c)(6) is a non-profit organization that exists to serve its membership. So like a bunch of businesses in a city get together to form an organization that works for their common good. The business organization doesn&#x27;t make a profit, each individual business makes a profit and pays their taxes.A 501(c)(3) has a lot more restrictions than a 501(c)(6), so you might wonder why a 501(c)(6) would want to be organized as a 501(c)(3). Well, that&#x27;s because donations to a 501(c)(3) are tax deductible and donations to a 501(c)(6) are not. So basically, tax avoidance by the people contributing to the organization. If those same people are the ones that created&#x2F;run the organization, you might even claim that it is criminal tax fraud (I am not making that claim - I don&#x27;t know enough about the ASF to have an opinion). But keep in mind that the amount of money that ASF brings in and&#x2F;or spends each year is basically nothing compared to what WikiMedia or Mozilla deals with. I&#x27;m not sure that these corporations would go to the effort for such a tiny amount of money.Maybe it started out with good intentions, and has slowly evolved to be worthless from a public good standpoint. reply TRiG_Ireland 10 hours agorootparentThanks.

Meanwhile, Apache has also collected a huge percentage of the big data infrastructure world (Kafka, Avro, Druid, Flume, Flink, Hive, Hadoop, HBase, Mesos, Spark, Solr, Pig, you get the idea) and those are watered and made to flourish.

CLICK HERE to see The Aviation Geek Club contributor Linda Sheffield’s T-shirt designs! Linda has a personal relationship with the SR-71 because her father Butch Sheffield flew the Blackbird from test flight in 1965 until 1973. Butch’s Granddaughter’s Lisa Burroughs and Susan Miller are graphic designers. They designed most of the merchandise that is for sale on Threadless. A percentage of the profits go to Flight Test Museum at Edwards Air Force Base. This nonprofit charity is personal to the Sheffield family because they are raising money to house SR-71, #955. This was the first Blackbird that Butch Sheffield flew on Oct. 4, 1965. The SR-71, unofficially known as the “Blackbird,” was a long-range, Mach 3+, strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed from the Lockheed A-12 and YF-12A aircraft. The first flight of an SR-71 took place on Dec. 22, 1964, and the first SR-71 to enter service was delivered to the 4200th (later 9th) Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base, Calif., in January 1966. The Blackbird was in a different category from anything that had come before. “Everything had to be invented. Everything,” Skunk Works legendary aircraft designer Kelly Johnson recalled in an interesting article appeared on Lockheed Martin website. Experience gained from the A-12 program convinced the US Air Force that flying the SR-71 safely required two crew members, a pilot and a Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO). The RSO operated with the wide array of monitoring and defensive systems installed on the airplane. This equipment included a sophisticated Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) system that could jam most acquisition and targeting radar and the Nortronics NAS-14V2 Astroinertial Navigation System (ANS). SR-71 Astroinertial Navigation System According to the Smithsonian Institution website, the ANS provided rapid celestial navigation fixes for the SR-71. Mounted behind the SR-71 RSO’s cockpit, this unit (that was affectionately dubbed “R2-D2” after the Star Wars movie came out in 1977), computed navigational fixes using stars sighted through the lens in the top of the unit. These fixes were used to update the inertial navigation system and provided course guidance with an accuracy of at least 90 meters (300 feet). Some current aircraft and missile systems use improved versions as a backup to GPS. About the ANS RSOs were known to say, “no one can jam or shoot down the sun, the moon, the planets or the stars.” Piloting the Blackbird was an unforgiving endeavor, demanding total concentration. But pilots were giddy with their complex, adrenaline-fueled responsibilities. “At 85,000 feet and Mach 3, it was almost a religious experience,” said Air Force Colonel Jim Watkins. “Nothing had prepared me to fly that fast… My God, even now, I get goose bumps remembering.” But once the SR-71 reached cruising speed and altitude, it was time to focus on the mission, which was to collect information about hostile and potentially hostile nations using cameras and sensors. The pilot’s job was to handle the aircraft and watch over the automatic systems to make sure they were doing their jobs properly. Meanwhile, the RSO handled the cameras, sensors, and the all-important ANS. The ANS was the 1960’s version of GPS, but instead of using satellites to locate itself, the ANS used the stars. This is because before the invention of the modern satnav networks there wasn’t a way to navigate the SR-71 in the areas where it operated. The SR-71 needed to be able to fix its position within 1,885 feet (575 m) and within 300 ft (91 m) of the center of its flight path while traveling at high speeds for up to ten hours in the air. The ANS provided specific pinpoint targets located in hostile territory. It was a Gyro compass that was able to sense the rotation of the earth, while still on the runway before the SR-71 would take off. The RSO could use his coordinates of the spot ….of one place …on the runway …then read of the ANS. They were almost always exactly the same. Not always were the same stars were used on every mission, as they used the stars depending on what part of the world they were going to fly to. If flying in the southern hemisphere* they used only the stars that were seen there. This print is available in multiple sizes from AircraftProfilePrints.com – CLICK HERE TO GET YOURS. SR-71A Blackbird 61-7972 “Skunkworks” On Jul. 2, 1967 Blackbird crew Jim Watkins and Dave Dempster flew the first international sortie in SR-71A #17972 when the ANS failed on a training mission and they accidentally flew in to Mexican airspace. The ANS works by tracking at least two stars at a time listed in an onboard catalog, and with the aid of a chronometer, calculates a fix of the SR-71 over the ground. It was programmed before each flight and the aircraft’s primary alignment and the flight plan was recorded on a punched tape that told the aircraft where to go, when to turn, and when to turn the sensors on and off. The stars were sighted through a special quartz window (located behind the RSO cockpit) and there was a special star tracker that could see the stars even in daylight. *It is not confirmed if the SR-71 ever flew in the southern hemisphere.

Absolutely and unreservedly a complete fantasy. ZERO have ever been tested, and there’s literally a better use for a nuclear warhead.

Why would anyone trade an EMP for all their cities? Literally doesn’t make sense. No one in the nuclear arms control world takes it seriously. It’s a boogeyman for defense contractors and grifters, but I repeat myself.All that said, GPS denial is a very real thing, and has been repeatedly demonstrated in an operational context. It’s relatively trivial to do. You just need a regular ground based antenna, and not a particular strong transmitter because satellite signals are weak.

Kill all electronics w&#x2F;o all the fallout. reply jonathankoren 1 hour agorootparentNo. That’s not what I mean. I’m talking about big boogeyman of an EMP attack that destroys the either the North American electrical grid and assorted electronics or merely all electronics in a city.There is no nonnuclear EMP weapon. Every proposed EMP attack is literally a hydrogen bomb delivered via an ICBM and detonated at extremely high altitude. That is the only way to deliver one to the proper place and the only way to deliver the required energy. That’s just the physics. Even then, the actual effect at ground level, is unpredictable because of simple shielding and atmospheric turbulence. But the undetermined effects aren’t what makes an EMP fantastical. It’s fact that it’s delivered by an ICBM!The premise of an EMP attack is that somehow the attacker could surprise their enemy and land a catastrophic knockout blow near instantaneously (where “instantaneous” is defined as “between 10 and 30 minutes” (i.e. the flight time of either an SLBM or ICBM)) with little to no retaliation. A Launch on Warning policy (i.e. launch a retaliatory strike when an incoming missile is detected in the air) along with ground and space based surveillance systems makes attempting to execute an EMP attack suicidal.Missile launch detection systems have been operationally deployed and maintained since the 1960s. They work. Launch on Warning has been the policy of the United States since the 1960s. Implicit in a LOW policy is that the retaliatory strike order is given in minutes from a detected launch. This means the retaliatory nuclear weapons are already sent on their irreversible course before any incoming detonation occurs. This is the defense posture a hypothetical EMP attacker is lobbing an ICBM into. This isn&#x27;t fantasy. This isn&#x27;t just math. It’s the explicit nuclear posture of the United States for the past 60 years. It’s what makes Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) work, and arguably has maintained peace between nuclear states for 70 years.If an attacker has decided to launch a nuclear laden ICBM they just started a full on nuclear exchange, because that’s the response. No one is waiting to see where it goes. It’s “The missiles are flying. Hallelujah, Hallelujah.” Now. Given that you’re in an inevitable nuclear exchange, is it reasonable to waste a nuke on a roll of the dice on whether it actually do anything when you could actually blow something up? Nay! Knowing that you are being blown up?On a related note, this is the exact situation why the proposed Prompt Global Strike weapon is suicidal. An ICBM armed with high explosives, looks exactly like an ICBM armed with nuke. Similarly, a kinetic energy hypersonic glide vehicle is not suicidal specifically because it doesn’t travel on a ballistic arc. reply TTorler 1 hour agorootparent> literally zero nuclear weapons have been detonated at high altitude https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Starfish_Prime reply helpfulContrib 1 hour agorootparentprev>There is no “fallout free” EMP.False.

He claimed to be the guy who invented the 2-part tuna can, and was known for handing out end chunks of titanium castings left over from some business he ran. At any rate, he had a couple of probably 8x4 inch (wide by high) cylinders of ground quartz crystal, so flat that you could put a drop of alcohol between them and they would be inseparable if you tried to pull them apart vertically. He claimed these were from the navigation system of Polaris nuclear missiles and their navigation worked by what you&#x27;d expect: Looking at the stars and comparing them to a super accurate timestamp, plus some core memory logarithmic tables or whatever. I apologize of I&#x27;ve gotten any of this wrong, but he seemed legit, and again I have switched off Google for this one. reply missedthecue 9 hours agoparentMy father worked on the guidance system for the Trident nuclear missile at Singer-Kearfott for many years and this is mostly accurate. There was a lot of geometry involved.They used to test launch the missiles back during the cold war from submarines off of California. The missile would cross the continental US and land in the water off Florida. The Soviets would invariably send \"fishing\" boats to measure the tests but the coast guard would never shoo them away -- they wanted the Soviets to know just how accurate these missiles were.

The silo doesn’t move, but the subs do. Their location is tracked with another inertial guidance system but that adds error, so they use the star tracking.Overall, the inertial navigation systems in modern icbms are not the limited in accuracy.My favorite…there was a lot of pushback inside the us military on investing in increasing the accuracy of naval ICBMs. Doing so was seen as communicating&#x2F;implying a shift in strategic goal from targeting cities (lower required accuracy) to targeting hardened facilities (higher required accuracy). That was seen as confrontational because sun based nuclear weapons had been generally treated as a second strike capability, but the primary reason to have the ability to target hardened facilities was for a first strike reply kijiki 7 hours agorootparent> there was a lot of pushback inside the us military on investing in increasing the accuracy of naval ICBMs.The book \"Inventing Accuracy\" covers this in detail.

One of the guys was telling me at lunch about his work that day. He had to run some simulations to tell the Navy if their Trident guidance system needed to be sent back for re-manufacturing after a forklift operator dropped it. My understanding is that the handling crate had some kind of integral rough handling detector. (I presume calibrated weights on thin wires, in 3 axes, so you can bracket the peak accelerations by looking at which wires broke and which didn&#x27;t.)I was told that once above most of the atmosphere, the MIRV bus guidance unit pops the lens off and takes a snapshot of the stars. The MIRV bus is rotating at that point, so the telescope scans a good section of the sky, but it takes a snapshot at a very specific time and is only interested in a rather small patch of sky. It compares what it sees with a stored copy of what it should see, and uses that to re-calibrate the inertial measurement unit.The way it was described to me was that one rotation checked the star field, the IMU was re-calibrated, the very next rotation was used to double-check the IMU calibration, and right after that, the MIRV bus started popping off the individual warheads. It seems strange to me that they would use such a short observation window to re-calibrate the IMU, rather than having a long period of continuous re-calibration. It&#x27;s also highly possible that the guy explaining it to me was giving intentional misinformation to avoid accidentally disclosing TS&#x2F;SCI to a non-cleared intern.The nitty-gritty of guidance is fascinating. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the main use cases for ultra-accurate guidance are in weapons.There was a pendulous integrating gyroscopic accelerometer from the Apollo IMU sitting in a glass case in the lab... a shame given how few people were allowed into the lab. reply hoseja 0 minutes agorootparentAn enthusiastic guy on youtube was trying to drop an egg from the edge of space and got shutdown for developing a terminal guidance system. So it&#x27;s not so much about the only use being weapons, it&#x27;s that weapons have state monopoly on precision guidance. reply KennyBlanken 1 hour agorootparentprevRough handling indicators are either glass vial based or contain a weight that slides into a window if sufficient force is exerted.

There is not enough Rayleigh scattering at that height to get in the way of a camera looking for stars to map to a star chart.

Northrop’s patents are more interesting than Lockheed’s, IMHO. In all cases the patents mention using an IR-pass filter to improve contrast.The sensor is essentially an analog lock-in&#x2F;synchronous detector with a rotating shutter and a wedge prism that nutates the star field about the boresight. the patented component in most cases is the shutter (there are different patterns, and Northrop came up with some clever designs).You end up with a frequency modulated signal from the photomultiplier tube (carrier is from the shutter, modulation frequency the difference between the prism and shutter).By measuring the phase and magnitude of the modulated signal, you can steer the telescope onto the star, and the “coding gain” from the lock-in is substantial.Edit, previous comments:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27084261https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23238437 reply pyinstallwoes 8 hours agorootparentI have recently been bitten by the modular synthesis bug, and it is wild to me how these terms seem to have correspondence even though I am learning it from the audio domain.

The following sentence, which says that \"If star tracking has not commenced before takeoff, it should start at an altitude where cloud cover and sky brightness conditions have improved.\", leads one to believe that it was possible for the sky to be too bright to track stars from the ground sometimes (since it basically says exactly that), but it now seems clear ground tracking during the day was possible. Maybe it depended on the latitude, time of day, and position of the Sun relative to the stars (low latitude in the middle of the day without sufficiently bright stars far enough away from the Sun = sky too bright, higher latitude early or late in the day with sufficiently bright stars far enough away from the Sun = track from the ground, any other combination = results may vary).

Doing so moved the bow shockwave of the cone so that it reflected inside the engine intake, which had the effect of slowing the Mach 3 air down to subsonic speeds so it could be used for engine combustion.

Right now, the Earth&#x27;s rotation axis happens to be pointing almost exactly at Polaris. But in the year 3000 B.C., the North Star was a star called Thuban (also known as Alpha Draconis), and in about 13,000 years from now the precession of the rotation axis will mean that the bright star Vega will be the North Star. reply hutzlibu 10 hours agorootparentWell, good point, but every moment in history had its fixed south and north stars, you could find easily, if you were familiar with the sky.

All the stars are changing - but this point is not. So even when there is no bright star at that spot - there will be star constellations around pointing towards it. A fixed point or area of reference ( and with no artificial lights, there definitely would be some star to see).But of course if you really know the dark sky well, there are a lot more points of references, you will remember what constellations will be where at what time of the night at what season.

Before each flight, someone had to generate a flight plan and punch it onto a physical tape, then load it into the plan. TNo mid-flight \"re-calculating route\" if stuff goes wrong.One of the most interesting and under-appreciated aspects of early aviation that is routinely forgotten by history is the fact that navigation was extremely difficult in a world before GPS. For example in WWII, pilots getting lost was a huge problem, especially for the Navy pilots. Imagine taking off of an aircraft carrier and flying hundreds of miles away from it, completing a mission and then trying to retrace your steps and find the 100 yard long dot in the wide open ocean again while flying at 10,000+ feet altitude. Pilots navigated with simple directions of, \"heading 310 for 50 knots, heading 120 for 80 knots\" and they would follow a handwritten piece of scrap paper and then try to come back. There were no landmarks to follow. To make things even more complicated, we didn&#x27;t exactly know distances very well. In a world like the ocean with no landmarks, you rely purely on compass and distances and time for directions. But if there is a tailwind vs a headwind then you could travel 80 knots in 30 mins instead of 45 minutes. This could put you wildly off course when you go to turn. It was incredibly scary to get into a cockpit and sail off into the ocean with no landmarks and hope to find a target and return back to the carrier (which itself is also moving). This is also why bombers and even long-range fighters actually had dedicated \"Navigators\" on board who&#x27;s sole job was navigation during flight.As an example, The Battle of Midway was almost a complete failure for the USA because the main bomber squadron actually got lost trying to find the ships that they were meant to bomb. Iirc they had meandered around the destination area for almost an hour and were bingo on fuel. The squad commander had actually given the order to turn around and as the planes were turning around, one of the pilots spotted the Japanese carriers in the distance. The battle of midway up to this point was a complete failure and had overexposed the Navy. The first dive bomb attack had lost all but 3 dive bombers (one of which only survived because he got separated and lost). The Japanese were getting ready to counter strike on the remaining US Navy which were congregated (against the will of most admirals and generals) just a hundred miles away. The fighter wing had shown up before the second primary bomber wing (which had gotten lost) and had alerted the Japanese to the surprise attack, in addition to devestating losses (about 2&#x2F;3) for the fighters. If these lost bombers had returned back without completing their successful bombing raid, it is safe to say that history would be re-written. Japan would have destroyed the US Navy and eventually consumed the USA. This would have distracted the US from aiding Europe and Europe would have likely been lost to Germany. All because of how difficult it was to navigate before GPS.I just find early aviation so fascinating with how they accomplished so much with so little. We often look back and forget so many simple things about aviation like navigation because we take it for granted today. Hell, my watch can pinpoint my location anywhere on earth to within a few feet. Yet location in the 40s and 50s was usually determined by drawing circles on a map that cover 50 mile diameters and saying \"we think we are somewhere in here\".A prime example is the original story. In a world before GPS, where we need precise long-range navigation, what are you going to do? You have to work with what you have. We didnt have satellites yet (well at least not ones like we needed), you are too high for anything visual on the ground, too fast to reliably navigate manually, so what&#x27;s left? The stars. I&#x27;m sure someone in that brainstorming meeting said it was impossible, but there were no other choices, so they figured it out. And it&#x27;s incredible! reply sobellian 9 hours agoparentThis vastly, vastly oversells the stakes of Midway. Japan lost before the war ever began[1]. By the end of the war the US produced 17 fleet carriers, 9 light carriers, and 76 escort carriers. US strength at Midway was 3 fleet carriers. By the end of 1945 the US would still have built several new Navies as well as the atomic bomb. Japan was struggling to finish China on their side of the Pacific, their armed forces would be totally incapable of securing the sea lanes to the US let alone land such a massive invasion force as to sweep across the whole continent.The Japanese war plan was strategically inept from the outset - hit the US really hard, then sue for peace from a position of strength. But even if they got the carriers at Pearl Harbor, it was only a matter of time before US industrial output buried them and they failed to account for an enemy committed to total war. The turning point happened at Midway but the specific time and place don&#x27;t really matter - it was inevitable. For Japan to win the war they would have had to walk an improbable golden path from victory to decisive victory while suffering no irreplaceable losses.By the way, Germany displayed similar strategic ineptitude. Even if Germany won the Battle of Britain, they would not have been able to supply any invasion force they managed to land on Britain. They had no surface fleet, and they were staring down the largest navy in the world! All the Royal Navy needs to do is contest the Channel for a critical week or two and you&#x27;ve just lost your entire invasion force. As it happens they lost the BoB. Unable to finish the war against a globe-spanning empire, they proceeded to send their entire army into the USSR......and while US lend-lease certainly helped, the Soviet counteroffensive at the end of 1941 already inflicted such damage on the Wehrmacht that they started suffering shortages of men and equipment. The unsuccessful German offensive in 1942, Case Blue, was more limited in scope than Barbarossa because of these shortages - attacking in the southern USSR rather than the entire front as in 1941. Case Blue started the same month as the Battle of Midway - the outcome of the two could hardly be linked. With or without lend-lease, by end of &#x27;42 they are knee-deep in Russia with no prospect of further advance, while Britain blockades them on the other side.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=l9ag2x3CS9M reply failuser 10 hours agoparentprevNo way Japan would have been able to consume the USA even if Midway was lost.

Without a Russian front, the UK and the USA might not have been able to dislodge Germany from Europe, and the UK may have fallen [4]. Without Britain in allied hands, it would have been vastly more difficult for the USA to stage D-Day, and they certainly would not have been able to provide the fuel for their logistical needs via the Pluto pipeline [5].1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lend-Lease2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Europe_first3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Malta_Conference_(1945)4. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Sea_Lion5. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Pluto reply cameldrv 10 hours agorootparentprevIf the U.S. Navy had been tied up in the Pacific, I think it’s tough to say what would have happened on the eastern front.

That&#x27;s not as hard as it sounds, even with 1940s technology. You just need to navigate to within radio range, which is a couple hundred miles if you&#x27;re in the air.At the same time, they did get lost at times. reply ftxbro 10 hours agoparentprevWhen I saw this wall I thought it was the SR-71 copypasta. reply comandillos 12 hours agoprevSimply amazed by the fact that something similar to \"star trackers\" as we know them today goes back to the 60s... reply dylan604 12 hours agoparentum, doesn&#x27;t the sextant go back much much further than the 60s? reply BHSPitMonkey 12 hours agorootparentI think GP finds it impressive that the technology enabling a device to _automatically_ resolve its position (simply by looking up at the sky) goes back this far.

Been there, done that. reply cameldrv 11 hours agorootparentprevCompared to the rest of the engineering, I don’t think the computation is all that hard. It doesn’t need to be that fast since you only need to do a correction maybe every 10-20 minutes or so. The math was innovative in that they invented the Kalman filter for these types of computations. You pick your star such that it’s by far the brightest one in its neighborhood. So the image processing is just finding the brightest pixel.From what I’ve read (mostly the excellent book “Inventing Accuracy” the main challenge is very precisely aligning the telescope with the “stable member” in the gyroscope. reply supportengineer 10 hours agorootparentDid the units in question even have pixels? reply cameldrv 3 hours agorootparentNot exactly. The SR-71 system had an expected position of the star, and then it would mechanically scan the telescope in a rectangular spiral scan pattern with a single pixel photodetector until it found a star with the expected brightness. This could take up to 22 minutes from a semi-cold start (roughly, you know your heading within 3 degrees, and your position within 1 degree lat&#x2F;lon). [1] Once the system had shot a couple of stars and the IMU was dialed in, it could do an update in about 30 sec.The Trident I used a Vidicon tube (what they used to use for TV cameras before CCDs were invented) [2] The Trident approach was to shoot a single star once in the flight.The Trident II uses a CCD. The first version of the guidance system for that missile (The Draper Mark 6) used a 90x90 CCD [3].

JULIA NIKHINSON (AP) AP SEP 17, 2023 - 19:14 CEST Help-wanted advertisements in New York will have to disclose proposed pay rates after a statewide salary transparency law goes into effect on Sunday, part of growing state and city efforts to give women and people of color a tool to advocate for equal pay for equal work. Employers with at least four workers will be required to disclose salary ranges for any job advertised externally to the public or internally to workers interested in a promotion or transfer. Pay transparency, supporters say, will prevent employers from offering some job candidates less or more money based on age, gender, race or other factors not related to their skills. Advocates believe the change also could help underpaid workers realize they make less than people doing the same job. A similar pay transparency ordinance has been in effect in New York City since 2022. Now, the rest of the state joins a handful of others with similar laws, including California and Colorado. “There is a trend, not just in legislatures but among workers, to know how much they can expect going into a job. There’s a demand from workers to know of the pay range,” said Da Hae Kim, a state policy senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center. The law, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2022, also will apply to remote employees who work outside of New York but report to a supervisor, office or worksite based in the state. The law would not apply to government agencies or temporary help firms. Compliance will be a challenge, said Frank Kerbein, director of human resources at the New York Business Council, which has criticized the law for putting an additional administrative burden on employers. “We have small employers who don’t even know about the law,” said Kerbein, who predicted there would be “a lot of unintentional noncompliance.” To avoid trouble when setting a salary range, an employer should examine pay for current employees, said Allen Shoikhetbrod, who practices employment law at Tully Rinckley, a private law firm. State Senator Jessica Ramos, a Democrat representing parts of Queens, said the law is a win for labor rights groups. “This is something that, organically, workers are asking for,” she said. “Particularly with young people entering the workforce, they’ll have a greater understanding about how their work is valued.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition Comments Rules More information UAW justifies wage demands by pointing to CEO pay raises.

[0]But the ranges are $20-40k for each grade and it’s hard to tell what you will end up being offered and accepted.I think it helps prevent some mismatches of people confusing $20k and $200k positions but I frequently see people with work history in the $30&#x2F;hour range applying for very high pay jobs. I find it hard to accurately peg my market value.When I worked in smaller orgs I would frequently see variability of 100-300% for the same job title. And even in really large orgs with big HR there might be a $100k pay band before bonuses.So what do I do with a job posting that says $110-250k? If Im senior, do I apply and expect $250k not knowing if there’s a single person who is amazing making they amount? Or if Im junior do I ask for $110, knowing I could get more.What I do is network to find what the actual pay is and negotiate around there. Or discuss with multiple offers.Id like to see something like the IRS releasing more anonymized data from w2 for employers that will let you look up quartiles by employer, broken out by employee filing address.This also has severe limitations but at least you can see how many employees they actually have and actually pay based on taxid. But self-reported pay data is so bad I don’t think it’s actually useful for stuff like “does this company I found on the internet actually hire people?” Unfortunately titles are so useless that I don’t think anything more than number of employees and distribution of their pay is better than what we have now.The privacy implications are serious and need to be accounted for. But I think only releasing for orgs over 100 or something. Or only for publicly traded. Or only that receive public funds, etc etc[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opm.gov&#x2F;policy-data-oversight&#x2F;pay-leave&#x2F;salaries... reply altdataseller 21 hours agoparentI have asked some HR people this question about ranges, and most of them tell me they expect to pay the midpoint of the range. That is, if you meet the qualifications, they’ll offer you the midpoint. However if you blow them away or got some competing offers, they will offer you the high end. And if you got very little experience, the low end. That’s the rule of thumb. It doesn’t matter if the range is as wide as 80k-400k, just assume the midpoint is the starting offerI’ve also done some research where I took offers people disclosed in TeamBlind and compared them to the job posting, and in most cases the offer was very close to the midpoint https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1SfaV1p_jbgoTOyCsD5wd... reply carlob 21 hours agorootparentIf the range spans an order of magnitude, should I consider the logarithmic or linear midpoint?

But I worked for a firm where senior manager band was $120-350k. Most senior managers came in at $120-150 and would climb through years with the firm. If a new hire at the senior manager rate asked for $225-250 as a midpoint it would kill their negotiation and likely cost them their offer. reply desert_rue 12 hours agorootparentThe band should be what the company is willing to pay the new hire, not what everyone with that title is making. reply bandrami 20 hours agorootparentprevIf a range spans that many digits I think you haven&#x27;t really done the work to figure out how much the labor is actually worth. reply artursapek 21 hours agorootparentprevYep, the range is also used for internal promotions.

People are not commodities, and only in the most trivial of work can you a priori know what an individual brings to it. It&#x27;s typical government thinking that makes no sense in the real world. So employers are stuck publishing an absurdly wide band that reflects the difference in what different people might bring to the position.This is effectively populism, a simple and wrong solution to a much more complex problem. reply sarchertech 21 hours agorootparentIn the vast majority of cases, you’re not going to know what an individual brings to the job for 6 months to a year at the minimum. The majority of the pay difference between 2 people with the same job title (assuming standard bigco leveling) comes down to negotiating ability.Published pay ranges aren’t going to solve anything, but they do reduce the information asymmetry a little bit. They give you and idea of what is possible for they title in that company at that location. Companies have an incentive to post a relatively accurate range, and in most of the jobs I’ve applied for it was. reply pc86 21 hours agorootparent> The majority of the pay difference between 2 people with the same job title (assuming standard bigco leveling) comes down to negotiating ability.No, it comes down to about 1&#x2F;3 negotiating ability and about 2&#x2F;3 prior experience, impressions you give at the interview, and leverage (e.g. other offers real or perceived). The first one you can get from the resume and the other two happen over the course of the interview(s).If your resume shows you as a perfect fit for a position with a ton of relevant hyper-specific experience, you will naturally get an offer higher in the pay band than someone with half the amount of pseudo-relevant experience. Pay bands even $40-50k will help because most people actually do have a decent idea how qualified they are for a given job. I&#x27;ve applied for things where I&#x27;d be happy getting an offer toward the bottom of the pay band due to no relevant experience, and applied for things where I knew I should be at the very top. reply sarchertech 21 hours agorootparentWhen I say negotiating ability I also mean to include multiple offers. Which in my experience is the single biggest factor in determining pay for most software engineers.I agree more specialized and very senior rolls are different, but most people are going into much more generic roles. Even then bad negotiating skills can swamp out everything you else if you throw out a low number to someone willing to take advantage of it.All said we agree that realistic pay bands will help here. reply rat9988 21 hours agorootparentprevI have yet to see a position where the company has no idea about the budget allocated for it. reply NovemberWhiskey 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not uncommon to have budget be expressed in headcount rather than dollars, though. So you can hire one \"senior software engineer\" and your HR department has a model that tells them at what percentile of \"senior software engineer\" pay any given amount is - then you need to go into an exception process if you (as hiring manager) want to pay over 90th or 100th percentile or whatever. reply Spooky23 21 hours agorootparentprevSays who?Labor is absolutely a commodity, and companies price labor both for buying and selling based on skills and demand.You may inhabit some obscure corner of the world where you’re some sort of free agent priced individually. But most likely, you’re working for a company in a title assigned by some HR person into a salary band. The salary band is chosen by the business unit based on their budget.The wide bands are published to minimally comply with the law. In the long run, they advertise to applicants that the company will happily bone them given the choice. reply bandrami 20 hours agorootparentprevOr they could just figure out how much the labor they are shopping for is worth to them and advertise for that. reply lotsofpulp 20 hours agoparentprev> So what do I do with a job posting that says $110-250k?

Or if Im junior do I ask for $110, knowing I could get more.You apply with the knowledge that you will earn at least $110k, and if you want more, you should apply to more employers so that you have the negotiating position to ask for more. reply blfr 23 hours agoprevI have never worked in a job where you can give a reasonable pay band and routinely made 1.5-3x what other people with the same title did, before bonuses. This really only works for well-defined jobs in production, retail, and seems to bring little utility for the HN crowd. reply viraptor 22 hours agoparentThat may be also a sign of poorly defined levels.

It&#x27;s not like in the army where everyone knows the difference between a colonel and a general.You could run an organisation where everyone from a new graduate right up to Linus Torvalds has the same title, just a different level of pay. reply viraptor 13 hours agorootparent> I mean, titles don&#x27;t really mean anything to developers.To the developers themselves? Yeah, it does to many. To the company in general - there&#x27;s a reason level descriptions exist. They define expectations for a given person. Let&#x27;s say you create a new team for project X: you want someone who can plan the project out. Are you going to give that to any \"developer\" who all exist at the same level? If no, then you have different levels, you&#x27;re just pretending they don&#x27;t exist.It also makes things more clear for the pay. Let&#x27;s say you get some good mid level dev who gets bumped many times for being really good. If they&#x27;re just doing well at that level but not advancing, are you going to pay them more than senior devs with more responsibility at some point? Is that a wise decision? reply jabradoodle 20 hours agorootparentprevYou could, but you would implicitly give them titles and have different expectations.No one is expecting a junior to define the technical roadmap for the next 6 months and coordinate it&#x27;s implementation across 5 teams* and be the final judge on disagreements.Edit: typo reply abigail95 12 hours agorootparentprevI think having the same requirements you should expect more than 3x deviance for a lot of roles.We aren&#x27;t talking about an observation between the random difference between two average people. We&#x27;re talking about the most performant and least performant people who could potentially share the same job description.The entry level is full of this. If you hire a bunch of engineers with no experience, how often will you see a difference of 3x or larger between the top and bottom.I would say often, and it doesn&#x27;t show anything bad about the organisation. reply bpodgursky 20 hours agorootparentprev> poorly defined levelsObsession over crisply-defined levels is a sign of an organization that is too far up its own a*** to actually get work done. reply sarchertech 16 hours agorootparentThere’s a difference between obsession over clearly defined levels and someone making 3x what everyone else at their level is making.When you’ve got a team of midlevel engineers making $150k and one guy making $450k maybe it’s time to bump that person up. reply mschuster91 22 hours agoparentprevThe same work should bring the same payment, period. Everything else just ends up rewarding those with the best \"negotiation\" skill which is completely unrelated to one&#x27;s actually work-relevant skills. reply blfr 22 hours agorootparentThere is no such thing as \"same work\" outside of a production line and the like. You learn this in the initial weeks of your career.In every tech company there are programmers, project managers, and sales people who have the same titles but deliver vastly different quality of outcomes. And everyone knows this because they instantly pick the good ones whenever they have the slightest optionality.You have a new project, difficult client, some fuckup to straighten out, and everyone&#x27;s eyes turn to the same person. It&#x27;s such a common occurrence, you must have seen this. You must have seen people being fired without a single tear or with a sigh of relief and others quitting to widespread worry over who will manage to step in for them. People with the same roles on paper. reply mschuster91 21 hours agorootparentSo what, you can use a well defined bonus structure. At least that is transparent and related to one&#x27;s own work skill. reply sokoloff 21 hours agorootparentLet’s imagine that msc91 is the person we always turn to when the chips are down and they always deliver great results in the clutch situations while maintaining all of their regular duties as well.How long until we rationally decide to pay msc91 a monthly “in case the chips are down” bonus&#x2F;retainer? Msc91 is made better off; the company and its customers are made better off and thereby, msc91’s colleagues are made better off.If we decide on principle that we won’t do that, how long until a better-funded or better product-market fit company comes along and hears through the grapevine of ex-msc91 colleagues that they should pay their overall higher wages to msc91 and get them to join? Now, all of the good things that could have happened in the prior paragraph are lost. reply blfr 21 hours agorootparentprevInterestingly, you can&#x27;t. Although to be fair, plenty of managers still believe they can.Imagine a job where results seem fairly easily quantifiable: sales. You want to hire a great salesguy you know. His current salary is 168k and he collects another 85k in bonuses. How do you get him?You offer him 260 base and some unspecified bonus you will work out later. Why? Because he already knows what kind of bonuses he can collect where he is but only has a vague idea of your company&#x27;s product potential.This uncertainty and unattainability of full information forces companies into either wide bands or made up titles. That&#x27;s even before he goes to his current boss for a competing offer. reply sokoloff 22 hours agorootparentprevNow define “same”, particularly for creative work where value created can be a factor of 10 or more off.There are qualified, employed SWEs that I’m 3x as good as.

That includes production and retail workers. reply sarchertech 21 hours agoparentprevIf you’re making 3x what other people at your level are making, you’re at the wrong level. Unless you’re already at the highest level. If you’re worth that much more, I’m surprised that you don’t push for a higher level.The point of levels is to provide an external signal of competence. And perhaps this law will push companies towards doing a better job of that.In nearly 20 years of experience pay doesn’t generally correlate with performance. The people who I’ve seen with massive pay differences were the people who could negotiate well and knew how to play the game to come in with multiple offers. Those people aren&#x27;t usually the most long term productive employees. Some of them are, but many of them are just better tangentially related skills.The biggest single difference in starting pay by far is having multiple offers. If you make it through selective company A’s hiring process, you likely could have made it through a few similar processes. Whether you bothered to do that or not, says nothing much to me other than how much you care about compensation. But most hiring managers have a serious case of FOMO and this works in the majority of cases. reply coffeebeqn 19 hours agorootparentWhy would you push for more responsibility? If I could get paid like a technical leader but without the extra stress then what’s wrong with that? reply sarchertech 16 hours agorootparentWho is going to pay you 3x what the rest of the people at your level make without a corresponding increase in expectations.The reason you’d push for a higher level is because it makes it clearer to the next company that you’re capable of higher level work. If you’re not doing higher level work then how are you justifying a 3x salary? reply cmrdporcupine 20 hours agorootparentprevOr \"levels\" are a low-granularity schema that can&#x27;t box in how people actually work in their jobs.The reality is that every person working in a position brings different things to the table. While larger businesses create defined level boxes and paths, they&#x27;re really very rough and imprecise ways to describe people and often do a disservice to people who work hard but not in the way that the boxes \"expect.\"So there are definitely cases when we see people&#x27;s compensation out of sync with their level (in either direction) and it&#x27;s sometimes a product of the company recognizing the value of an employee but having levels and tiers that don&#x27;t match the employee exactly.Some companies, for example, tie higher pay to a management&#x2F;leadership ladder. But you can be a solid-contributing or 10x or whatever software developer without going down the leadership road. reply sarchertech 16 hours agorootparentSure they are low granularity. But one person making 3x what another of the same level does goes way behind a rough and imprecise description. That’s a complete breakdown of a level system. reply elromulous 23 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve previously commented [0] on how broken this implementation is.

In companies with no market for stock options (privately owned, startups, companies that are just absolutely worthless), equity is hypothetical money which may never be worth anything. I worked for a company which gave me 250,000 options but the company lost 18mil a year and they ended up cancelling all stock options. Some people worked there for 15 years hoping the options would be worth something and eventually saw them cancelled outright. Unless I&#x27;m working for a publicly traded company, I don&#x27;t put much value in stock options. With a startup, you&#x27;re basically asking to be paid in poker chips.2. Health insurance is something I expect to be there, regardless of the monetary value.3. I&#x27;ve worked for plenty of companies that include a 10% performance-based bonus as part of the compensation only to never get that bonus (or get nowhere near 10%) regardless of my own performance because the company itself didn&#x27;t profit last quarter, or they did profit and just chose not to pay out bonuses.4.

I&#x27;m thinking that it would be pretty decent for dishwashers, cashiers, gas station attendants, etc to know if a job is offering say $15-18 per hour or $20-25 per hour. But this seems horrendous for salaried remote knowledge workers, particularly those that have the ability to negotiate a better deal. And additionally, there will be unintended consequences of this legislation, such as some employers not wanting to deal with New York employees.2) If the goal of this legislation is to prevent exploitation, it seems that requiring a salary floor would be important, but requiring a salary ceiling would be a negative part of this legislation as it makes it a lot tougher to allow employees to have the room to negotiate. reply donohoe 19 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t agree with your second point, but lets say you are right: the benefits of having a \"salary ceiling\" to me still outweigh any down-sides. I would argue that in many roles it gives a betters sense of what is on the table and allows folks to aim for higher than they might have.No legislation is perfect, but this a vast improvement over the current situation. reply logicalmonster 19 hours agorootparent> a vast improvement over the current situation.Personally speaking, this only seems to be a very marginal improvement over the current situation if you consider the impact of legislation in a vacuum and magically wish away any possible unintended consequences.Does your analysis consider that at least some employers will not want to deal with employees affected by this? You might wish that this wasn&#x27;t a thing, but it is.Maybe this legislation isn&#x27;t as questionable in good economic times where companies are rapidly hiring as many people as they can wherever they can, but it seems particularly self-destructive in a market where employers have the leverage to look anywhere.What are you going to tell those increasingly desperate New Yorkers who start getting sad feedback like the following? \"Thank you for your application to our company.

California and now NY all require salary transparency. What&#x27;s going to happen is the opposite. More and more states that don&#x27;t have these laws, especially neighboring ones (like NJ, Connecticut) are going to disclose their salaries because they&#x27;re competing with companies from those states that are being transparent, and attracting more candidates because of that transparency.They&#x27;re all going to surrender to what the market is asking of them. Salary transparency is quickly becoming table stakes reply logicalmonster 17 hours agorootparent1) You&#x27;re guessing about what&#x27;s going to happen in the future like it&#x27;s a complete given that only good things would result from this and enough other states would join in. I would point out that (this doesn&#x27;t involve speculation) we already know that some companies don&#x27;t want to compete in locations that have these policies, which isn&#x27;t ideal for New Yorkers.2) Your positive speculation might be a little more reasonable were we entering great economic times where companies were rushing to hire anywhere they can. In troubled economic times, companies have a lot more leverage to seek the best deals they can and can exclude locations that are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth. reply altdataseller 16 hours agorootparent1) That was true when it was just pitiful Colorado (no offense to Colorado residents)2) That might be true for some companies that need mediocre talent, but if you’re looking to hire the best, and don’t got a salary disclosed, those elite workers have plenty of other options replytest6554 19 hours agoparentprevThe employer is much more likely to post a higher, unrealistic, salary ceiling that they have no intention of actually paying in order to attract more&#x2F;better candidates. reply convolvatron 19 hours agorootparentthat tends to self-correct. talking to candidates burns alot of time. sure, you can lie and try to get a better outcome. but you also spent precious time buttering them up only to have them walk away in a huff.

So if someone applies for one and there&#x27;s a more junior position that&#x27;s a match you just tell them that.That happens all the time by the way and it&#x27;s fine. People often come to one job via keywords and don&#x27;t see the various options.I just think the whole premise is that we need this like ninja ability to react on the fly, and optimize the process to perfectly get the comp into this exact number that&#x27;s the best possible deal for the company or something.But it&#x27;s not. It just makes the experience disorienting and confusing for applicants, the same way it does when they have to deal with some insane process to buy cars and mattresses and enterprise SaaS contracts, which they also hate.Explain the job and then say what it pays.

If you&#x27;ve been very underpaid, it&#x27;ll be a lot harder for your next employer to offer you a 10% raise if you know the bottom end of their advertised range would be a 60% raise.I think the commenters here focus too much on themselves and people like them. This law was not written for SWEs with a market value of $120k&#x2F;year who are being paid $80k&#x2F;year. 0-60th percentile income workers are getting absolutely hosed and need every bit of negotiating power that they can get.Our working and hiring culture is very weird and favors employers. Anyone can be fired at any time for (almost) any reason, so your ability to pay rent and put food in your mouth depends upon your ability to find another job. When that process involves several dozen or hundred job applications, long hiring timelines, multiple interviews across days, weeks, and months, >60% rates of ghosting at every step, and exploding offers, lower income workers are often forced to accept the first offer they get regardless of how much lower it is than their true market rate. This wage transparency policy helps low-wage workers avoid entering the long hiring pipeline for jobs that pay abysmal wages.It is a strong net-positive for these workers who need it most. reply Eumenes 23 hours agoprevCompanies generally use third party compensation benchmark tools like Radford, which are total garbage. They base comp off title, and these tools are stuck in the stone age (think &#x27;programmer analyst&#x27; as a SWE). When recruiting and&#x2F;or engineering decide to post a job, they need to consult HR, who don&#x27;t know anything about tech hiring, so they&#x27;ll just guess. This will result in a broad, inaccurate, or crappy range. This seems like a decent law for retail and lower skilled jobs, but I think it just creates confusion for tech&#x2F;startups. Engineers&#x2F;tech employees talk, and its evident in online forums, slack&#x2F;discord groups, linkedin, etc. When I see people say they won&#x27;t apply to a job w&#x2F;o the band or will pass on the job if its low, I&#x27;d suggest you do your own research. See who the company employs. If they are hiring talent from companies known to pay big $$, the posted band is just a bureaucratic formality because nobody knows how to properly navigate it. Also, talk to recruiters - they know what people are getting paid. reply sokoloff 22 hours agoparentNo one in 2020: “I won’t apply to AWS because of the global salary cap of only $160K (or whatever the figure was back then).”When (substantially) all of your comp is cash salary, posting cash salary ranges is illuminating.

The rationale for such laws is to ensure an efficient allocation of labor. An expected side-effect of efficient allocation is higher wages as employees take the best paying job they&#x27;re suited for but it&#x27;s not like the point of the law is to make McDonalds pay 25$&#x2F;h for a fryer.> [1] The legislation underscores New York&#x27;s commitment to addressing wage disparities and promoting transparency in compensation practices across the state. It ensures that employees have access to vital compensation information, and empowering them to make informed decisions about their careers.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dol.ny.gov&#x2F;pay-transparency reply sdfghswe 17 hours agorootparentOk thanks for this. reply ZoomerCretin 19 hours agoparentprevOur labor market is completely different. There is no loyalty between employee and employer anymore, so job switching is far more frequent here. The hiring culture is similarly bonkers: you have to apply to dozens or hundreds of jobs to get a callback, even when unemployment is low and employers are whining to anyone who will listen that it&#x27;s hard to find workers, even for low-wage restaurant and retail positions. Employers take a long time (days, weeks, months) to get back to you, they interview you multiple times, and they ghost you entirely at every stage of the process.Imagine going through this, just to be told \"You&#x27;re hired, and the wage is $x&#x2F;hour\", where x is far less than you make now or would need to pay rent.Salary transparency laws are necessary because workers, especially lower-wage workers, have finite time and cannot go through this process and receive multiple offers. Employers can hold out for desperate workers, but workers need to eat and pay rent, and are thus forced to take what they can get. In this hiring culture, lower-wages workers are often forced to work for far less than they could otherwise get because of the high time and effort cost of finding better paying work. reply sdfghswe 18 hours agorootparentOk thank you for this. reply chiefalchemist 21 hours agoprevWhile I favor transparency, I don&#x27;t think this is something that should be legislated &#x2F; regulated.

Yes OS: Windows 10CPU: i9 9900KGPU: 3070tiRAM: 32GB Main Issue: KSP2 will throw a PlayerPrefsException error when the game's registry Key/Entries is filled up with too much information, At that point KSP2 will never again complete the initial load into the main menu. Whats Happening: KSP2 is adding information every time a SOI change happens or if a save file has been loaded. It all appears to be similar information repeated again and again. Screenshot of Spam: Reveal hidden contents Timeline: 24 February 2023: 0.1.0.0 to 0.1.2.0 KSP2 started fine. 22 July 2023: 0.1.3.0 the PlayerPrefsException started happening but I wasn't sure what the cause was. I fixed it by creating a new local account on my computer. 23 September 2023: It happened again with the new local account. Important Information: It only took two months to get to this point this last time. Once others start playing KSP2 more regularly it will only be a matter of time until others have the same problem. Workaround: Delete using regedit: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Intercept Games\\ Be warned though, deleting the wrong thing can stop applications from working, or even break the entire operating system. Files: The following is the registry entries for 0.1.0.0 until when 0.1.3.0 stopped the game from loading into the main menu (322mb): (Changed from reg file to text file) KSP2RegistryEntries.txt Log file created yesterday: Ksp2.log Unity Links: PlayerPrefs Information: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html PlayerPrefsException error: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefsException.html Edited Sunday at 10:17 AM by Anth12 Quote 1 2 3 NEXT Page 1 of 3 7 Dakota Community Manager 1,954 329 14 Community Manager Posted 17 hours ago Hi all, The team is aware of this issue and we have a fix. It's currently being tested and we're aiming for a hotfix since we see this as critical. I'll share more details on a timeline when I have one. Dakota Quote 21 Kerbart Members 5,935 4.2k 4 About me: Mun Marketeer Posted Sunday at 07:34 PM (edited) ARE THEY INSANE??!! I know professional developers who recommend .ini files over the registry “so you can never get blamed for messing up the registry” and [snip] use it as if it where a Temp file?! And that is on top of gargantuan game save files? “Save files were getting too big so we're using the registry instead.” Wow. You couldn't come up with this when asked for a list of “stupid things no developer ever should do” and yet here we are. I'm liquided they're wrecking the KSP legacy but now I'm PO'd they're trying to wreck my PC as well. I have the habit of briefly playing KSP2 after each update until I get disgusted with it (that doesn't take long, as you can imagine). Now I even don't want to do that and I'm seriously considering uninstalling the game until this is fixed. In my (and assuming everyone's) book this is not something that can wait two months until the next patch; fixing this warrants its own hot patch rolled out as fast as humanly possible. I didn't think anything could surpass the current state of the game as a bad reflection on the dev team, but here it is. They truly outdid themselves. @Anth12 thank you for uncovering this. Edited 13 hours ago by Vanamonde Quote 12 cheese3660 Members 61 42 Posted Sunday at 01:28 PM (edited) Alright, doing some investigating it seems that they are saving the Pqs preferences based off of the instance ID of the pqs object, which, according to unity's own documentation, changes between runs of the game, hence why its saving 10 trillion different copies of the same data Update: On doing even more investigating, I have come to the conclusion that it is vestigial side effects of part of an editor tool that wasn't supposed to be in the game, and could easily just be removed Edited yesterday at 01:13 AM by cheese3660 Concluded what it was Quote 12 schlosrat Members 344 509 1 About me: Spam in a Can Posted Sunday at 01:52 PM Upvoted. I agree with others. This should be moved to the very top of the priority list immediately. @Dakota, perhaps we need a new category for bugs that cause chaos outside the game? This is a whole other level of Not OK, transcending the impact of any other class of bug. It's universal in its horrible badness. Other bugs, even really persistent and nasty ones like wobbly rockets, orbital decay, etc., can constrain the kind of craft you build or mission plans, but this is a class of bug that can make the game simply not start at all, and worse it does so by creating an issue for the OS. I hope the fix for this one is simple! Quote 9 MechBFP Members 2,611 2k 1 Posted Sunday at 04:05 PM (edited) Okay, I don't think this should have to be said, but adding anything to the registry should be limited to NECESSARY DATA ONLY.

Your sleuthing suggets an instance ID which sounds to me as something very volatile and changing — how could they use that? Was this simply a typo? And what else did they get wrong?

That uses the registry to store some session values instead of storing the in a dictionary. And somehow that code made it into production. “The notion that we did this knowingly is preposterous.

These persisted after uninstalling the game as well. Quote 3 RalphKerman Members 49 33 Posted Sunday at 03:43 PM Wow, this is crazy. It took my system (installed on a pretty fast M.2 SSD) about 5 seconds to load and display the registry node (and I hardly play KSP 2 ever). I had so many entries that I was wondering how my system still works.... Please fix this. The registry is a crucial part of the operating system and seeing it being (ab)used to store masses of not needed data is \"concerning\" (the only word I can think of that does not get me banned here instantly....). I will not touch this game anymore until this is confirmed to be fixed. Thank you so much, @Anth12 for finding and reporting this bug! Quote 3 Kerb_ New Members 6 3 Posted Sunday at 07:41 PM 100% agree that this is deserving of a hotfix.

Who in their right mind is so fond of KSP2 right now, they will risk running a game that is spamming the registry and then on top of it, run some random person's code to delete blocks of reg data? Unreal. To be fair, the \"random person's code\" is completely open source and you can read it to figure out exactly what it does. In a sense, it's safer to run than the game Quote 2 Kabinet New Members 1 3 Posted Sunday at 11:54 PM Storing anything at all in the windows registry is somewhat bad practice, but using it for large amounts of runtime data, AND not even deleting it afterwards or managing it correctly. Wow. That is some grade A+ premium bad practice spaghetti I would get second hand embarrassment from seeing in a 24 hour gamejam codebase. My only hope is that whichever developer wrote this was either extremely sleep deprived or didn't read the documentation for the PlayerPrefs API and just guessed what it did from function names alone. Even then something called \"PlayerPrefs\" should be a red flag if you're aiming to store anything other than player preferences. I am both confused and utterly shocked someone wrote this in a production videogame. Quote 1 2 3 NEXT Page 1 of 3 Reply to this report...

Create or update is a good pattern for robustness (eg so a troubleshooting user won&#x27;t brick the app by deleting or renaming the key), if you can guarantee the uniqueness of the primary key.

All I ever read about it seem to be horror stories.Can&#x27;t you store stuff alongside the install? Or in some user data location? reply dataflow 17 hours agorootparent> what is the windows registry and why do things need to write to it?It&#x27;s a centralized, high-performance small key value store that&#x27;s the alternative to writing a million config files in random places.It&#x27;s arguably much better in my experience. E.g. one of the never-ending headaches I always have on Linux is updating config files when a package updates. There&#x27;s no automatic file merge in general (hence .pacnew and such) so you gotta do it by hand (and not everything is available with the foo.d&#x2F; hack). The registry already operates at the value granularity so it bypasses this kind of issue.And as a developer you don&#x27;t have to worry about some things you might not think about, like the trade-off between corrupting your config files with in-place updates vs. having to create a new file and replace the old one after every config change. reply rapind 17 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s always annoyed me with many operating systems is this need to organize based on function instead of domain. If I install an application named \"Bob\" then I want ALL of Bob&#x27;s configuration to live within Bob. I don&#x27;t want it split between different registry keys or &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local, &#x2F;etc&#x2F;, &#x2F;var, &#x2F;lib, etc.I&#x27;m fine with there being conventions and categorizations, but I&#x27;d like to root node to be the application itself. Yes, I even want this for multiple users.I know there are design arguments to &#x2F; for the various different ways of organizing configurations, but IMO they are just inferior from at least this user&#x27;s perspective. reply tremon 16 hours agorootparentYou are correct, from a user&#x27;s perspective this seems like unnecessary complexity. But here on the system administration side of Chesterton&#x27;s fence, these splits enable more secure, more robust and more reliable systems. Among others, this allows for improved backup and recovery, better storage efficiency, easier application of security patches and providing centralized configuration. reply Someone1234 17 hours agorootparentprevI think for all future development, the industry agrees with you.

If those are not complete enough examples of this shining vision, go ahead and show us how it&#x27;s done. reply spoiler 16 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re constructing an argument the person never made.The binary for my app could live in a hypothetical &#x2F;apps&#x2F;bob.Its config could be in there too.There&#x27;s no need to duplicate dynamically linked system libraries in there.If the app need a different version of a library than the one provided by the distro&#x2F;os, it could vendor it (or link statically). Optionally it can vendor and still try to use OS version if they version is satisfied, but this is just a memory optimisation (disk isn&#x27;t that expensive).There&#x27;s also no need to place firewall rules in there. I&#x27;m not sure where you got that from. Firewalls are beyond the scope of a single application?As for making thing system-wide available, there&#x27;s already a few solutions for this (symlinks being a very backwards compatible way of doing this on nixes).For all its faults and poor UX execution (albeit, maybe things improved since I last used them) flat pack and snap have some good ideas! reply a-dub 5 hours agorootparentprev> There&#x27;s no automatic file merge in general (hence .pacnew and such) so you gotta do it by hand (and not everything is available with the foo.d&#x2F; hack). The registry already operates at the value granularity so it bypasses this kind of issue.it gets around this issue by creating a gigantic systemwide or per user bucket of crap that inevitably ends up inconsistent.since it is custom there is no good tooling for doing diffs and many developers treat it as quasi private so the config values are often not human readable.there are management utilities that work ok, until they don&#x27;t. then you have to start over because who knows, it&#x27;s all just crap.it&#x27;s literally like a jerry seinfeld joke. you think configuration should be sensible, then everybody just sees this bucket and goes wooopty woopty woo and then it&#x27;s just filled with crap.bill gates probably sent emails about it. \"i tried to look at the registry, but then it was just trashed.\"that is the registry. a little shadow filesystem with a bizarre layout with weird and incomplete tools that is filled with crap. reply somat 2 hours agorootparentprevIt is one of those ideas that sounds good. \"Hey we will put all the configs into a database under one tree\", Oh wow, that sounds great, sign me up. The main fundamental problem is now you have two trees, with completely different access patterns.It is also all in the spin. What if I told you over on this side of the OS table we too keep all our configs in this great single tree database, not only that, we keep our data in the same database, everything is accessed using the same simple unified interface, the api has about five calls, it is pretty great. It also has the amazing feature that physically separate devices can be merged into the same tree.Preposterous! some would say. All in the same tree! Why you would get everything muddled up. you must have a separate tree for each device. and a special tree with it&#x27;s own special access patterns just for configs.But for real, people keep trying to reinvent the registry over in linux land.

(I&#x27;ve got experience for example in Windows kernel mode drivers and service development.) reply dataflow 12 hours agorootparentWhat are you comparing against here that&#x27;s leading you to a different opinion? Are you claiming file I&#x2F;O would be faster or that you could write the equivalent functionality faster?Also note that performance isn&#x27;t just speed either. reply vardump 12 hours agorootparentFor example SQLite is superior. That said, on Windows you kinda have to use registry, especially on the kernel driver level. reply dataflow 10 hours agorootparent> For example SQLite is superior.First... where are you getting this from? I just spent half an hour writing a an incredibly simple benchmark and all I see is SQLite being something like 20x slower than a registry query, seemingly caused by repeated locking & I&#x2F;O system calls. This is on a trivial database with just 1 table with just 1 row, vs. a registry that&#x27;s on a machine that&#x27;s been running for years. If you have a benchmark that can disable the locking and get comparable performance, I&#x27;d love to see it. Not that it would mean anything though, given the next point.Second, even if it were somehow faster... you&#x27;d be comparing apples to oranges. The registry has a bunch of things SQLite isn&#x27;t designed for: security integration with the rest of the OS, a hierarchical structure, OS hooks for monitoring & interception, multithreaded access, etc. Have you tried doing these with SQLite before praising how fast it is?> That said, on Windows you kinda have to use registry, especially on the kernel driver level.Is it common for drivers to use SQLite to store configuration information in any OS?

And given the registry is basically a massive hierarchical structure, how is it different from files re: \"random places\"? The same dev that dumps files in \"Random places\" would dump values in random places in the registry.The registry is almost never a good choice for storing...anything outside of the operating system itself, unless the data is somehow tightly coupled with a specific Windows install (e.g. an activation key). The idea of storing instance data in the registry is madness. reply pshc 4 hours agorootparentprevExcept the part where whenever you install anything on Windows the whole OS grinds to a halt... I assume writing to the registry takes an exclusive lock. Or has to contend with decades of backwards compatibility layers and triggers, or both... reply msla 17 hours agorootparentprevThe performance part is questionable, as is the discoverability: Programs write binary blobs to impossible-to-find keys and, as we see here, there&#x27;s nothing preventing a severe loss of performance if the program writes too much to the registry. It can only be examined with specialized tools, and, due to the binary values written to it, it might not be meaningfully editable at all. reply akira2501 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also really a pain once you realize that many strings are stored in raw UTF16 form.

User preferences are stored there (\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\").System-wide preferences are stored in a \"hive\" for system apps (\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\").It allows applications to mix and match system-wide stuff with user-specific stuff, which only differs by which \"hive\" it wants to query against. It has several data types for different types of records. There&#x27;s conventions for how to store things (although apps can do whatever they want), so apps usually store their state and config data under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\MyCompany\\MyApp for system-wide stuff, and user specific stuff will live under HKCR\\SOFTWARE\\MyCompany\\MyApp.All in all, my experience has been that on average its usage is a bit more standardized than config files. Of course on windows, apps (particularly C# apps) ship both with config files and a boatload of registry entries.Lastly - by design, HKCR (the user profile hive) is assumed to sometimes have orphaned data. If a program is installed per-user, and you uninstall it as a different admin user than who installed it, the other user profiles cannot be loaded and modified by the installers thereby orphaning any other user data. reply doctor_radium 14 hours agorootparentprevI believe there is a Registry of sorts in Windows 3.1, but is largely empty. It was only in the Windows 95 era that it ballooned into what we have today. Coming (at the time) from an Amiga perspective I was bemused to realize that if 3.1&#x27;s progman.ini file was damaged, that the program groups in Program Manager (think of each group as a node in Start -> Programs, basically the user-oriented files and executables from a software install) could just disappear! While there&#x27;s a slight performance hit, one would think it would be more robust to scan the disk for .grp files every boot and build this data dynamically in memory. I have always assumed this was done because 3.1&#x27;s memory management was complete crap, necessitating that Microsoft \"write everything down\". Ditto for 95, and being a much more ambitious OS, there was that much more to write down. Then the third party vendors jumped on board. Fast forward to 2023 and this legacy still persists when it doesn&#x27;t have to.I could be blowing smoke, but this has always been my thinking. An old joke: Registry was derived from the Latin word registratum, which means \"put all your eggs in one basket\". reply gruez 17 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Windows_Registry#Rationale reply emodendroket 17 hours agorootparentprevBased on the follow-up questions, it sounds like you already know what it is and just wanted to advertise your allegiance to the Unix way of doing things. reply WorldMaker 16 hours agorootparentprev> Coming from a Linux background, what is the windows registry and why do things need to write to it? All I ever read about it seem to be horror stories.The Windows Registry is the NT Kernel&#x27;s system config&#x2F;preference store. The closest Linux equivalent is dconf. Like dconf it is built to be a read-mostly&#x2F;read-optimized database. It&#x27;s not as strongly focused on a service-bus architecture as dconf. It tries to heavily optimize for an MRU on-disk order (somewhat like redis) and optimize for strong write consistency (unlike redis which is happy to do more in memory between flushes to disk). Any writes at all generally thrash the Registry \"hive\" database files some. Heavy amounts of writes will murder it. It was optimized for reading not writing.The Registry was side-ported to Windows 95 from the NT Kernel, in part because COM (it became the central spot for registering COM components), and a lot of mistakes were made in the messaging about it. It was intended to be Kernel-focused and mostly never used by user-space applications. That unfortunately wasn&#x27;t made clear enough, and needing to register COM components in it certainly muddied the message. So Windows apps have a long history of storing a lot of things to the registry, much of which they should probably use user config files for.> Can&#x27;t you store stuff alongside the install? Or in some user data location?In Windows due to a complicated dance with anti-malware efforts and secure binary memory mapping it is generally frowned upon to store stuff alongside installs (in the %ProgramFiles% or %ProgramFiles(x86)% directories). Many programs (especially well written ones) don&#x27;t even have write permissions at all to their install folder (similar to how many distros lock down &#x2F;bin and sometimes &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin and&#x2F;or &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin to superuser accounts only). For backwards compatibility reasons with applications dating all the way back to Windows 95 some app installer are allowed to still re-ACL their install directory to give back write permissions to the application. Also, in modern Windows (since Vista), depending on a number of factors Windows will actually lightly sandbox the app when that occurs and redirect ACL changes and writes to an \"overlay\" directory, allowing the app to believe that it still is writing to its own install directory but it is actually writing to a machine or user directory outside of %ProgramFiles%.On the other hand there are plenty of user folders available for config storage: Generally the suggestion is %AppData% for most such files. (This is the \"Roaming\" app data that may be automatically copied to other machines for some users on some networks, mostly enterprise&#x2F;corporate accounts&#x2F;users.) Some apps may prefer %LocalAppData% which doesn&#x27;t roam for larger config files or more machine-specific transient things (like window positions or caches). It&#x27;s also common enough to see cross-platform apps use Unix-style dotfiles under %Home% and even sometimes XDG-style dotfiles under %Home%&#x2F;.config&#x2F;. That&#x27;s not generally recommend and especially because of roaming behaviors the general preference is to use the appropriate %AppData% or %LocalAppData% and avoid cluttering %Home%. Though many Windows users don&#x27;t even really use or see %Home% for a variety of interesting reasons, so its not entirely frowned upon as wrong. (Unlike storing config files under %Documents%, an ancient mistake of many Windows apps not as terrible as storing things in the Registry they shouldn&#x27;t, but more visibly obnoxious to Windows users that want tidy Documents folders and feel that folder should be entirely user-controlled.)Also, there is a machine-wide config location, somewhat akin to &#x2F;etc, named %ProgramData%. reply tored 14 hours agorootparentA bit weird that cross platform apps use dot files or dot directories directly in %Home% on Windows. If they already are cross platform, thus taken the time and resources to do that, why not add a compile flag to move them into %AppData%? reply WorldMaker 13 hours agorootparentThat is a very good question, made all the weirder by even Microsoft&#x27;s own cross-platform apps using %Home% instead of %AppData%. VS Code uses %Home%&#x2F;.vscode&#x2F; and dotnet (.Net 5+) uses %Home%&#x2F;.dotnet&#x2F;.One of the things that made a work computer more complicated than it needed to be was that part of the network setup redirected %Home% some of the time to a network drive (Z:) (a \"Home\" drive) and other times %Home% was still on the default drive in the default user folder location. I&#x27;d constantly have to copy files like npm&#x27;s .npmrc from one folder to the other to make sure that every use of npm found a right copy of .npmrc.That \"home drive\" setup is a relatively common in my experience ancient Windows corporate hack for hand roaming some user files (sometimes including %Documents% which was likely the real intent but %Home% used to be easier to redirect than just %Documents%), so there is a sense of irony in some tools using %Home% as a non-roaming storage only to have it haphazardly roam due to some ancient corporate policy. It&#x27;s also funny that it is possible for there to be two %Home% folders on Windows in competing locations with different contents, because the %Home% redirect seems buggy.I think part of it is that there is a growing sense on Windows that %Home% is for \"non-roaming, developers might to text edit this\" configuration and %AppData% is for more UI-driven config that is less expected to be edited. A lot of developers learn %AppData% just fine, but there is some cross-platform convenience for developer life if you can always in PowerShell (or bash) just vim `~\\.somercfile` and expect that to always work. But I still think using %AppData% more consistently is possibly a better thing for Windows apps to do. reply mjburgess 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s just &#x2F;etc reply hulitu 13 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s just &#x2F;etcSome files in &#x2F;etc have manpages. reply adastra22 17 hours agorootparentprevIt is some combination of &#x2F;etc and &#x2F;var. a hierarchical key-value data store shared by the whole system used for configuration management mostly. reply SSLy 11 hours agorootparentprevlike dconf, but strictly worse (eg, doesn&#x27;t have schema) reply tlhunter 17 hours agorootparentprevThe windows registry is a hierarchal data storage system.

Unreal is open source* but you pay to license the engine, so you can make core changes I.e. memory management or tweak underlying net code. Unity is closed source and so you can only really extend very core parts of the engine.FWIW my experience in gaming has been that Unity is exceptionally powerful and allows game developers to create games that would otherwise require an entirely separate dev team to support the engine. When I first learned game dev, the code sections were almost entirely devoted to interacting with the underlying graphics libraries (OpenGL or DirectX) and hardly any to creating powerful features in a game.

In httpd.conf we have a sort of SGML that’s mostly line oriented CDATA. aliases and many other mail files are all members of the Berkeley DB lineage of key value stores. default&#x2F; feels like it’s also a key value store but one suspects that one could probably put a command in there and something would execute it. rc.d is 99% code but with semantics in the symlinks too (see also Debian’s alternatives.) A very large number of files look like braced C code; named.conf even requires terminal semicolons!There’s no value in either consistency or diversity of the underlying implementation be it a registry — the registry, or a gconf thing — or a filesystem smorgasbord of config languages. Without the discipline (authoritarianism?) of a social structure — for example a “company” with a hierarchical leadership that can promote&#x2F;fire you — you will get diversity in any system.I just reminded myself of the time I used ansible YAML Jinja templates to control EdgeRouter config files that programmatically built config in &#x2F;etc. Time for a leisurely stroll in a real garden I think, far away from a computer. reply kortex 14 hours agorootparentprevNo, because the filesystem is one layer of abstraction lower than the registry. There&#x27;s nothing with less bottleneck to the filesystem besides raw device access. The registry runs on top of the filesystem. If you wish to use the registry for filesystem-like purposes (eg storing startup config specific to the app or user state), just use filesystem. If you wish to use it like a database for system-wide information, that&#x27;s a better use-case, but the registry isn&#x27;t quite a proper database.Windows programs proliferate $HOME junk, too. And that&#x27;s an issue in its own right, which should be addressed by platform-specific application dirs (e.g. the platformdirs library for python). reply Joker_vD 14 hours agorootparent> No, because the filesystem is one layer of abstraction lower than the registry.That doesn&#x27;t prevent it from becoming a KV dumping ground for every process and their dog to litter with whatever, at all.

Just go look at what configuration files are located between applications on Linux for example, it is not consistent at all. reply kaylynb 10 hours agorootparentLinux is about as consistent as Windows these days. &#x2F;etc isn’t really a “dumping ground” for everything and is quite static now. Just diffed a snapshot of &#x2F;etc on my workstation from a month ago and there aren’t really any changes I didn’t put there myself. It’s reasonable to make &#x2F;etc immutable on a lot of systems; something impossible with the registry.Home is a bit more chaotic but most applications follow the XDG specs. Mostly. Less so with cache and state files (vscode, for example, dumps tons of cache&#x2F;state files in .config instead of .cache and .local&#x2F;state). And weird things like Flatpak shoving everything in .var.I’d say things generally behave about as well as windows apps which often treat documents as a dumping ground for all kinds of files. I always have to go to pcgamingwiki to find game data locations without having to check half a dozen places.For administration I really like the &#x2F;usr and &#x2F;etc divide. Vendor files go on &#x2F;usr, and overrides for the running system in &#x2F;etc. It’s useful to be able to peek in &#x2F;usr to see defaults.You don’t really get that ability with the registry. With some more modern setups &#x2F;etc is bootstrapped from &#x2F;usr (for example, with systemd-tmpfiles) and you can “factory reset” a system by clearing out &#x2F;etc (with some asterisks around restoring state for a few of the legacy state files still kept in &#x2F;etc if the system is has manually created users&#x2F;groups). reply philistine 16 hours agorootparentprevmacOS has a folder called Library where this stuff is supposed to go.

I&#x27;d provide an API for a prefix-tree based KV store with specific data types (eg bytes, utf-8 string, bool, int, float, datetime...) with some mechanism for namespaces and path access controls or the like. Processes would always have their own space to use ad-lib, and would have controlled access to system-wide or cross-process spaces.This sort of implementation lets you optimize access patterns so that basically each process gets its own KV&#x2F;db (if it wishes) which should be roughly as performant as rolling its own kv running on the filesystem. Vs all processes all competing for the same data structure, all the time. reply duped 11 hours agorootparentI agree with this.

The registry already supports a rich, granular permission system, and enforced sandboxing for access. In a greenfield design, yeah, I could see your design being quite useful, but adapting and enforcing a usage pattern on current day Windows isn&#x27;t that far off. replypathartl 17 hours agoparentprevMost games that _do_ use the registry use it as a data store that may or may not be accessed by external applications. It provides a very reliable pathing (at least at the time of the game&#x27;s release) to access typed data.For instance, most EA games from the early 2000&#x27;s standardized the store of the CD key in ~HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\\\ergc. This would let one install the game to any drive and still have access to the CD key.Games also use the registry as a way to point to where the game is installed. In the worst case scenario, it&#x27;s used as a dumping ground for the game&#x27;s preferences&#x2F;settings and save states. With the shift to 64 bit and the introduction of WoW64 and most recently the shift to VirtualStores, I would rather nobody ever stores anything in the registry.I&#x27;m currently working on a compatibility shim geared towards games that will redirect winapi filesystem and registry calls to a custom location. Hopefully it&#x27;ll result in being able to make more portable installs of games that may require access to the registry. reply kortex 15 hours agorootparentThose sound like exactly the use cases the registry should be used for.

I can imagine some services where transactions across everything are unavoidable, but I&#x27;ve also worked on lots of things where there&#x27;s different databases and transactions aren&#x27;t needed between them.Some times it is a relaxation of requirements though. Some people might want&#x2F;need account deletion to also remove all the content related to the account transactionally, etc, and if that&#x27;s a requirement, everything account related must be in a transactionable system.If you can be more flexible on that, separating account management from other data is pretty common in my experience. reply Dylan16807 17 hours agorootparentprevYou still need to store variables somewhere.The equivalent of \"separate microservices\" is making sure multiple programs don&#x27;t share registry keys, and that&#x27;s already the case 99% of the time for this kind of key. reply Joker_vD 17 hours agorootparentprevWell, the file system, too, is a global variable.

It&#x27;s literally just bad project management.I&#x27;ll list their sins from my armchair:- remaking a beloved, established game that has a prodigious base of features and extremely extensive modding support. you have a HUGE hill to climb just to get to your \"MVP\" - you have to supplant the existing game plus its modding community, and this is already a niche audience of [\"people who find orbital mechanics as a primary gameplay loop to be fun\"]. They were always going to need to really fucking knock it out of the park on their first at-bat to make this work.- doing so on a short time-frame- trying to be all artsy about it too. not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, but it does position you to take your time rather than going fast. and like I said, they already had a steep hill to climb.- standard-issue development hell. it happens.- special-issue development hell where TTWO did some fucky-wucky stuff where they hired away a ton of the staff from the studio they were contracting with, cancelled the contract, and brought it all in-house with the poached team. Hardly an encouraging sign.- with all the delays adding up, I suspect they were given the ultimatum to either ship their current state into EA and start recouping money, or get scuttled. People have allegedly looked into the code and found extensive additional systems that were basically hastily commented or hacked out so they could ship some vaguely-functional core.I was really, really looking forward to KSP2. KSP1 but with good graphics, a non-unity engine (it was always a miracle that squad had gotten such good large-scale physics out of unity), and promises of official support for non-kerbin bases and interstellar travel? Yes please, sign me up!But honestly, my mental model for how this would be successful was \"they&#x27;ll reimplement the existing base game in a new engine. big task but doable for TTWO&#x27;s money, it&#x27;s not indie anymore, and they obviously already understand the product. Then, with the base game ported, people will be willing to buy in EA because they see the promise of &#x27;KSP but more!!!&#x27;\". And that last bit was going to be critical, they&#x27;d need people bought-in if they wanted TTWO to keep funding them &#x2F; them keep funding themselves.So when they launched this scrap heap into EA, I knew it was doomed. And look at the, what 8ish months between then and now? They&#x27;ve released a few quaint patches that ignored all the huge issues and done basically nothing else.I fully expect them to now slowly wind the EA down with a skeleton crew and people will just forget it to an ignoble death. I mean, TTWO can hardly be keen on continuing to pour development funding into this EA, right? reply powercf 17 hours agorootparentFrom my armchair I&#x27;ll add that throwing away the KSP1 engine and replacing it with, based upon the number of bugs, a new implementation of the same basic idea seems like a terrible idea. My understanding is that most of the original Squad team (i.e. the only people in the world with experience building a successful orbital mechanics game) weren&#x27;t kept on for KSP2. Take Two should have done everything possible to keep them as core KSP2 developers.All that said, I don&#x27;t think the game will be left unfinished. All costs are sunk and Take Two has a (reportedly) somewhat functional, nicer looking copy of KSP1 with, presumably, at least base elements of interstellar travel and colony systems in place.

They just needed a really solid core of unjanky physics for an MVP, which was why a sequel was needed in the first place - KSP 1 engine limitations. Couldn&#x27;t even deliver that. reply philwelch 15 hours agorootparentprevThe root problem with KSP2 is that they needed to make the core of the game perform much better than KSP1 in order to pull off the scale of what they intended to achieve. And then the they shipped into EA with significantly worse performance than KSP1. reply Noughmad 18 hours agoparentprevWell, I still believe it&#x27;s going to be good eventually. Like KSP1, for example, or No Man&#x27;s Sky. There certainly have both the resources and a guaranteed player base to make that happen.That said, I cannot be sure of that, so I will not buy it until it is actually good. reply digging 18 hours agorootparent> KSP1, for example, or No Man&#x27;s SkyThose are two very different examples, though. NMS was improved heavily but in many ways never approached the features and qualities that people were expecting. KSP2 feels more like NMS than KSP1 in that regard - people have expectations. They&#x27;ve been sold a specific vision which doesn&#x27;t look like the game. Further, unless it&#x27;s great... why not just keep playing KSP1 with extensive modding? reply Dylan16807 17 hours agorootparent> NMS was improved heavily but in many ways never approached the features and qualities that people were expecting.Asking who? From what I&#x27;ve seen, the typical sentiment is that they&#x27;ve gone far past the expectations they set.For KSP2 I think the main expectations were eventual new content (starting with a good chunk less than KSP1 and adding more later) and better performance. And they sure haven&#x27;t delivered performance. reply rimunroe 17 hours agorootparent> Asking who? From what I&#x27;ve seen, the typical sentiment is that they&#x27;ve gone far past the expectations they set.I enjoy the game a lot more now, but the original E3 \"gameplay\" trailer still feels like it overpromises. Comparing the current state to that trailer there are quite a few things that have fallen short:I&#x27;ve never encountered a planet which was as lush as the one shown initially. You don&#x27;t find animals packed that closely together. I don&#x27;t think semi-aquatic animals like the sauropod-looking things in the trailer are supported in the game either. You don&#x27;t see animals running around in packs like they showed either. The closest thing you see is about five identical animals spawned into the same small area.The video also shows you being able to fly swiftly above the surface of a planet. I may be misremembering, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been able to fly quite that quickly, but the biggest difference is that the game suffers from very noticeable object pop-in (it can even be noticed when moving at low speed).I think you can fly with wingmen now, but I&#x27;ve not tried it.This might not sound like much, but the existing game just looks far less interesting than the original trailer even if many rough boxes have been checked since then. Also, I&#x27;m not even looking at any other pre-release announcements or videos for reference. reply digging 17 hours agorootparentprevWell I really hope neither of us spends too much time worrying about this today but I will respond with some points in addition to the other reply you got.> Asking who? From what I&#x27;ve seen, the typical sentiment is that they&#x27;ve gone far past the expectations they set.I&#x27;ll note that anybody still playing the game probably likes it, and anybody who doesn&#x27;t like it probably stopped playing years ago (except to perhaps check out new updates and continue to feel disappointed).Some specific things:- planets feel lifeless and very samey: there&#x27;s nothing to really explore because the depth of geology, biology, ecology is not there. I suspect that&#x27;s why they added so much base building, which was never a significant part of the early hype&#x2F;marketing.- even features they implemented feel incomplete and shallow, such as player customization and base building, compared to many other games which do those things better.- the game was described as allowing the player to navigate an actual star system, and instead it&#x27;s just a skybox densely littered with pirates and asteroids. If I want that, X4 is a hundred times better. For exploring stellar systems, Elite Dangerous or just SpaceEngine show that it&#x27;s possible to do well. replyxinayder 1 hour agoprevThis is amazing. It shows that a developer team from a triple-A publisher with billions of dollars at their disposal is just incompetent. The single-man team headed by HarvesteR and later some other devs that joined him were much more competent and it was an indie game.Take2 killed the KSP franchise and they continue to do so. From less and less frequent updates (KSP2 has received only 3 \"major\" patches since it was released in February, taking 2 months between updates), to useless hotfixes that take a week to be deployed to fix just a single bug, to them taking 6 months to try to find out the reason the rockets are wobbly, to them releasing a game in Early Access which wasn&#x27;t even ready for EA, it was an alpha prototype, completely broken down, and just trying to milk the franchise lovers for their $40 for an INCOMPLETE PROTOTYPE (which will be raised to $70 once the game leaves EA), I wish they just abandoned KSP2.KSP1 with its modding community has produced so much and it&#x27;s a much better game than its sequel. The charts don&#x27;t lie, right now 1k players on KSP1, 67 on KSP2.Now someone&#x27;s going to tell me \"this is not how game dev works\". Well. They have billions at their disposal and a predatory publisher on their back. And their dev team consists of a lot of modders from the KSP community which I particularly don&#x27;t blame them for not delivering, but Nate and the team that was poached from Star Theory by Take2 because the former didn&#x27;t agree with the time frame Take2 gave them to release a working prototype, they are really incompetent.They are \"building the game from ground up\" using the same engine as its predecessor and amazingly they came across the exact same bugs that KSP1 had fixed like 8 years ago. This is not even newbie game dev, it feels like they&#x27;re just a bunch of people that just started to learn how to write software.I have an opinionated website tracking their lies and deceptions (based on Web3 is Going Great), if anyone is interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nokerbal.space reply elzbardico 19 hours agoprevI haven&#x27;t done Windows native development for over 20 years, but at my time during the 90&#x27;s we already used the registry rather sparingly.

But it’s still a shadow of ksp1, while ksp2 was sold with breathless discussions of interstellar ships with colonization and a bunch of stuff that would really have made it a next generation on ksp. But instead it’s still a year or more from parity with a laughable cadence of improvements, minor patches coming out every two months. This is after they slipped their deadline repeatedly on early access.I think the community and reviews would be different if the parent company hadn’t outright screwed the original developer of KSP, which was a beloved game. The drama around that poisoned a lot of community good will, because the original developers clearly had a love for the game and the community and made something unique, then were unceremoniously dumped and cut out of what was supposed to be a well funded effort to build KSP “right.” Then they release this as “right” and it’s a huge disappointment. reply pluc 11 hours agoprevIs it common to use the registry essentially as a database? 300mb is way more than I expected that thing to support in a single key, but I admittedly know nothing about Windows.

No science, shitty graphics, excessively wobbly rockets, inconsistent orbits, (other than graphics) seems familiar?It took a looooong time for KSP1 to get where it is now, it will also take awhile for KSP2 to be as polished.Chill out. reply ye-olde-sysrq 18 hours agoparentKSP1 was made by a bunch of scrappy lovable indie devs making their first game (iirc Squad&#x27;s team was a marketing company prior to this?) in a LCOL area funded by dreams and whatever $10 early access sales they made on steam, with no-one to tell them what to do.KSP2 is made by TTWO, who is a publicly traded AAA studio of notable fame and decades of legacy and domain expertise.If Squad sold KSP1&#x27;s IP to TTWO and then went and made \"KSP2\" under a new name with their squad-sale money, that would be a different story. But even with that goodwill, I would still not be believing in the current KSP2 ever being a success story. reply ilyt 17 hours agorootparent> KSP2 is made by TTWO, who is a publicly traded AAA studio of notable fame and decades of legacy and domain expertise.KSP2 was made by indie devs (Star Theory) hired by T2They just... failed.. they negotiated budget, failed to deliver, negotiated another bigger one, failed to deliver again, and T2 said \"fuck it\", took IP from them and created studio to develop it.ST actually wanted to sell out to KSP2 after that disaster but they basically chose to poach ST developers instead, because why you&#x27;d buy a company where management now failed to deliver on promised goals twice.My guess is ST either bite more than they could chew or purposefuly lowballed T2. reply eterm 16 hours agorootparentBut the people they poached included the management which was perhaps the worst decision that T2 made when they created Intercept Games.Furthermore, looking at the demos presented in 2019, it&#x27;s not clear that much progress was made between then and now.The complete stall since early access release (7 months with just a handful of hotfixes) and lack of feature delivery suggests that IG don&#x27;t have the competency to deliver.That, or they moved all their staff to their other \"unnamed title\" they&#x27;re hiring for and have KSP2 on the most minimum of developers to pretend they&#x27;re making progress toward their roadmap. reply zamadatix 18 hours agoparentprevBeing an original Alpha owner, prior to Steam even, I think many people forget it was ~$10 and that came without any overpromising by the development studio.The two releases are nothing alike and if KSP 2 intended to use the same release model it should have either been dirt cheap or not released for many years. As it stands now it comes off as a massive grift and deserves the hate. reply dotnet00 18 hours agoparentprevKSP2 was sold as a way to fix the mistakes and limitations of KSP1. It&#x27;s a given that people would expect KSP2 to be on a better trajectory rather than repeating the same mistakes, overpromising and overcharging.We could even just look at reentry heating, which was supposedly almost done, over 6 months later and even just that is nowhere to be seen. If that&#x27;s taking them so long, how are they ever going to deliver the rest of their promises? Many of which there are serious technical questions about the feasibility of (eg multiplayer). reply jylam 18 hours agoparentprevExcept KSP was cheap (I got it for $9 IIRC, which was good value) when still in beta. KSP2 is $50 for the same level of beta, after years of development and drama. Don&#x27;t chill, don&#x27;t buy this crap until it gets better. reply Uehreka 18 hours agoparentprevWhen KSP 1 shipped its alpha, there wasn’t a perfectly functional KSP 0 it was competing against. From what I’ve heard, they’re using the KSP 1 engine (restricting how much better they can make things) but are somehow shipping with many of the KSP 1 features missing. So it’s kind of a Worst Of Both Worlds situation.Until KSP 2 achieves feature parity with KSP 1, I don’t see any reason why I should buy it. reply sco1 18 hours agoparentprevSeems like the developers forgot too, since we have 10+ years of lessons learned and here we are starting from the same place making the same mistakes all over again. reply brucethemoose2 18 hours agoparentprevKSP2 can&#x27;t be developed forever.KSP1 had (AFAIK) a cheaper dev team with no demanding publisher and a good reputation that brought a steady stream of money during alpha.

I only care about the concept of Kerbal Space Program, the mere fact it is getting attention at all is shocking, let alone from a AAA game studio (for better or for worse there).

Details Second hand Kindles are waiting in drawers for someone to repurpose them into something great. Boasting large e-ink screens, wifi connectivity and ARM processors they are an amazing hacking platform. (This is the second version of this project, see the post about the original here) V2 Rewrite and Compromises Ideally this dashboard would generate and display its image on its own. The issue with doing this originally was that the Kindles ability to display images (via eips) requires they be in a strange format. A few yars back when I started this it was hard to get GoLang to generate this format but it was easy to cross compile GoLang to the target ARM-7 softfloat arch. On the other hand Rust could generate the image but it was a pain to setup the cross compiler toolchain (also connecting to Google API's wasn't well supported). In the 5 years that followed the dashboard was a great tool but as API services would die (Magicseaweed, Forecast.io, DarkSky, etc) it would break. Sometimes that would require changes to the Rust front end and I would have to setup the cross compiling toolchain on each new machine I was using and eventually this got annoying. I found out about FBInk which has Go bindings and decided that using that I could use it to do text layout and print the resulting PNG's to the screen. Unfortunately I found that GoLangs OpenFont lib crashes when run on the kindle and that these old arm archetectures aren't well supported. This seemed like an unstable footing to build on. This led me to my current compromise. I use FBInk on the kindle to display the images after curling them from a API Gateway/Lambda backend. This gives me a low friction way to update the API logic without needing to touch the kindle or cross compile anything. I also was able to use GoLangs tdewolff/canvas which provides nice text setting and image generation tooling. I think is the right balance to keep this device productive for another 5+ years.

Particularly because the device has a USB port and, by design, exposes a user partition that you can read&#x2F;write to (so you can upload files and documents and ebooks to the device).There&#x27;s definitely been an effort by Amazon to lock them down, but just taking your reverse-engineering tool of choice and decompiling their firmware binary will give you tons of readable code to dig through. They use a mix of java, native c, and javascript.Fun fact, at startup the Kindle looks for certain files in the user partition, with certain naming patterns. You can, for example, disable the screensaver by dropping a file with a special name there. They patched this once, but after doing a grep for the user-partition mount location (to see all the places in their code where they read from user partition files) I was pretty quickly able to find another way to do this. It&#x27;s fun stuff. reply miohtama 12 hours agoparentAre new Kindles still hackable or are they fully closed like consoles? reply theoreticalmal 10 hours agorootparentI looked into it precisely once, and found a bunch of results that the newer firmware versions didn’t have jailbreaks available, and that downgrading wasn’t feasible.

Can you explain how communication with the device works? reply konschubert 19 hours agorootparentYes, it needs a backend service. It is just a dumb screen that pools from a backend URL.The upside of this is that you can easily configure it remotely, because all settings after the initial setup are stored server-side...... and it makes the whole development flow easier when you can build, iterate and deploy on a server. reply EvanAnderson 19 hours agorootparentIs there any option to self-host that backend service?

You can adjust how many of the upcoming days are shown, and you can adjust the first and the last hour of the day.

I wasn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s touch-screen (like e.g. Kindle) or an entirely passive unit; so for example if it&#x27;s showing this week, can a user scroll on the unit to see what&#x27;s coming next week? :) reply konschubert 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a touch screen, it&#x27;s fully passive.A touch screen might be cool, maybe for a future version... but it would drive up the price.From a product perspective, I wonder if people wouldn&#x27;t rather pick up their smart phone if they want to look at their calendar more deeply.

It&#x27;s great to have these around the house, quietly doing their thing.One thing I will point out from observation, the radios on ereader devices aren&#x27;t great for heavy use; they were originally created for occasional syncing. Projects like these will require an HTTP request to somewhere to fetch data, on a regular basis, and the radio eventually stops working.

It brought the Mac’s first commercial success in desktop publishing, in PostScript fonts, and early PostScript printers including Apple’s game-changing LaserWriter. Although Mac OS X never inherited NeXTStep’s Display PostScript, its descendant Quartz and Core Graphics are still based on PostScript’s relative PDF. Following a short illness that started in macOS Monterey 12.3, PostScript has died suddenly in Sonoma. The first sign passed almost unnoticed in Apple’s release notes to macOS 12.3, where it recorded the “deprecation” of PostScript in WebKit: “Support for inline viewing of PostScript files is no longer available.” Then in macOS 13.0, Preview lost the ability to convert PostScript and EPS: “The Preview app included with your Mac supports PostScript (.ps) and Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) files in macOS Monterey or earlier. Starting with macOS Ventura, Preview no longer supports these files. Other apps that can view or convert .ps and .eps files are available from the App Store and elsewhere.” Finally, the complete removal of support for PostScript and EPS was recorded as another “deprecation” in the release notes for Sonoma: “macOS has removed the functionality for converting PostScript and EPS files to PDF format. As a result, CoreGraphics’ CGPSConverter returns an error when invoked, ImageIO no longer converts EPS files, NSEPSImageRep does not display EPS files, and PMPrinterPrintWithFile does not accept a PostScript file for non-PostScript print queues.” Search of Apple’s previous release notes doesn’t reveal any prior warnings of this removal of support or deprecation (in the general meaning of the term), in contrast to other removals from Sonoma such as ATS/ATSUI. Although conversion from PostScript and EPS must now be in relatively little demand, its demise has been rapid, as if Apple can’t wait for macOS to be rid of it. The most likely reason is security. PostScript is an old stack-based interpreted language designed at a time when code security had barely been conceived, and malicious software hardly existed. Among its attractive features is the fact that any PostScript object can be treated as data, or executed as part of a program, and can itself generate new objects that can in turn be executed. More recently, security researchers have drawn attention to the fact that it’s a gift for anyone wishing to write and distribute malicious code. As it’s effectively an image format, embedding malware inside a PostScript file could enable that to be run without user interaction, as with some other graphics formats. There are three major PostScript interpreters in common use: Adobe’s Distiller engine, built into its Acrobat products, Apple’s PSNormalizer engine, built into macOS, Artifex’s open source engine, built into Ghostscript, and widely used in Linux and other platforms. Research into those engines has so far been relatively limited, but has revealed some serious vulnerabilities. Most recently, Kai Lu and Brett Stone-Gross of Zscaler’s ThreatLabz published an account of three vulnerabilities they found in Distiller, and one in PSNormalizer, in 2022. Those were fixed by Adobe and Apple last year, in the latter case in macOS Monterey 12.5 released on 20 July 2022, and its equivalent security updates for Big Sur and Catalina. From the dates, I suspect that the removal of support for inline viewing of PostScript files in WebKit in Monterey 12.3 may also have been part of Apple’s mitigations. Apple was most probably prompted into conducting a security audit of PSNormalizer as a result of the vulnerability reported, and would have been faced with the choice of re-engineering it or removing it from macOS completely. Unlike the PDF engine in Quartz, PSNormalizer is now little used, and has no significant role in macOS. The first step was to make it inaccessible from the GUI by disabling that feature in Ventura’s Preview, then following that in Sonoma by removing PSNormalizer altogether, so removing its command tool pstopdf and Core Graphics’ CGPSConverter. This leaves those still wishing to convert PostScript files with a choice between Adobe’s Distiller in its paid-for Acrobat products, and Artifex’s Ghostscript, which has had its own share of vulnerabilities. There is also a third option, of running a late version of macOS Monterey in a lightweight VM and continuing to use PSNormalizer through Preview there. For most, that will be the cheapest and simplest option. John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe and driving force behind PostScript, died on 19 August this year. His page description language had brought success to the Mac for almost 39 years, but at least PDF lives on. I’m very grateful to Ben for drawing my attention to the changes in Sonoma. Postscript (it’s only appropriate) I’m now starting to see warnings from third-party app developers that, in Sonoma, their apps will be unable to open or import EPS files, for example, as they can no longer convert them using Quartz in macOS 14. Although the impact on most of us should be very small or negligible, if you do still use EPS or PostScript at any scale, you will need to prepare a solution for continuing to do so after upgrading to Sonoma. I wish you success. Share this: TwitterFacebookRedditPinterestEmailPrint Loading...

Liked by 1 person 2 Andrew Reilly on September 25, 2023 at 7:37 am Reply They should: that doesn’t require running the language interpreter on macOS: the Printer can take the fall. So that’s a way that some macs will still have: print their postscript, and then scan them back in (as image PDFs, naturally). Or ghostscript from MacPorts or Brew should do the job. It’s a pity, IMO: my historical PostScript documents aren’t going anywhere. Now it’ll be harder should I ever want to look at them again. (I’ve got 111 postscript files on my macOS system, mostly print support for various versions of vim, which clearly don’t matter, and 469 on my file server, mostly academic papers and software manuals (there was a time before PDF when gzipped postscript was the rule for such things). Liked by 1 person 3 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 7:45 am Reply “print their postscript, and then scan them back in” That’s nuts. All you need is a little VM running a late version of Monterey, and you can convert PostScript documents to PDF to your heart’s content in just a few seconds. With existing PS files, there’s no problem as you know their origin and provenance, so you know they’re not malicious. Howard. Liked by 1 person 4 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 7:51 am Reply “Or ghostscript from MacPorts or Brew should do the job.” I would counsel folk to be extremely cautious before installing Ghostscript. It has had some horrendous vulnerabilities recently. If it’s only used on historic PostScript files, then of course it’s perfectly safe. But should it be invited to render anything obtained from the Internet more recently, then you should be very wary of its potential abuse. I also think Adobe has a demanding task on their hands with the Distiller engine, but then we pay them for that privilege. Howard. Liked by 1 person 5 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 7:42 am Reply No. That’s going in the opposite direction. PSNormalizer takes PostScript and renders it into Quartz graphics for display, and that’s where the problems with malicious code can occur. Taking Quartz graphics and rendering those into PostScript output for a printer runs no risk at all. As far as I’m aware, you’ll still be able to print a PostScript file direct to the print queue of a PostScript printer too, but not to the print queue of a non-PS printer, which would require the PostScript to be rendered in the Mac.

Like 8 Andrew Reilly on September 25, 2023 at 7:42 am Reply Irrespective of any actual or possible security flaws in PSNormalizer (less likely than PDF, IMO, as the latter now has to support JavaScript functions), Apple’s security model does abhor interpreters: they’re a way to execute programs that haven’t been scanned, notarized or vetted in any way. (Especially in iOS, but the logic, if not the convenience, must surely extend…) Liked by 1 person 9 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 7:47 am Reply Any security model abhors interpreters that can treat data as code, and in turn use that code to generate more code. It’s a classic invitation to exploitation. Howard.

Howard Like 12 Sven on September 25, 2023 at 8:51 am Reply BTW, an easy way to get Ghostscript is with MacTeX 2023: https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html “[…] MacTeX installs Ghostscript, an open source version of Postscript. An optional package installs libgs, the dynamical library for Ghostscript. That library is used by only one program in TeX Live, dvisvgm. So it is not installed by default, but can be obtained using the “custom install” option in MacTeX. […]” Liked by 2 people 13 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 8:54 am Reply Thank you. Yes, but that’s best for those who want to install TeX, and you must ensure that you keep Ghostscript up to date, in view of its history of vulnerabilities. Howard Liked by 1 person 14 hhanche on September 25, 2023 at 9:03 am Reply That brings back memories. I have written quite a bit of PostScript by hand in my day, in order to create mathematically correct figures for anythhing from journal articles to geometry problems. Once learned, it was surprisingly easy to work with. But then I am also a fan of the old HP calculators using reverse Polish notation, also stack based. Though I admit that computing with several items on the stack can be a challenge at times. My most weird experience: We had a printer that would print a subscript in the wrong place in certain documents. I added some code to the PostScript file to gather data and print it out, which enabled me to diagnose the problem and make a change to the printer software fixing the problem. Those were the days! Looking back at them makes me feel old. By the way, if I felt the need to convert PostScript files today, my preferred solution would be to use ghostscript in a lightweight VM running linux. No GUI, just in a text console. And throw the VM away after use, in case it got compromised.

I thought this was coming when Preview and Quicklook stopped supporting EPS files in Monterey. Do you have any advice on batch converting hundreds of EPS graphics to PDF? And the best PDF version to save in, given a choice? GraphicConverter can do batches. It took a 246 KB EPS and made a 174 KB PDF version 1.5, produced with DynaPDF. Preview seems to throw away data and made a 31 KB PDF version 1.3 produced with its Quartz. As you say, Apple’s Preview will load an EPS, with only Export available – Export to PDF is grayed out. Export has undescribed options of changing the PDF to PDF/A and Linearized, which I assume should remain unchecked. Apple’s Help is of no help. It exports as PDF 1.3. I’m not sure about supporting batches. Illustrator can save an EPS as either AI or an Illustrator PDF. I wonder if an Illustrator PDF is different from a normal PDF, and if AI should be chosen instead of Illustrator PDF for layered designs. Liked by 1 person 22 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 2:45 pm Reply It all depends what you want to do with those EPS files. This doesn’t mean that all apps that accept and use EPS will lose that ability. I suspect that Adobe products use their own engines, and will continue to work as advertised. But any apps relying on PSNormalizer or Quartz (Core Graphics) to render EPS will lose that ability in Sonoma. I think the first step is to assess the impact on your use of EPS in Sonoma, then to consider whether to convert your existing files to a different format, and PDF may well not be the best choice, depending on the apps you’re intending to use. Howard. Like 23 Brian on September 25, 2023 at 5:32 pm Reply Thanks, good points. In most cases, these are old clip art EPS files that would be nice to see previews of in the Finder, so PDF seems like a logical choice. For those and for me, it’s just a question of the conversion method and if it makes any difference – Preview Quartz PDF 1.3 vs. GraphicConverter DynaPDF 1.5. I’ll do some experiments and see if I can find any differences. Liked by 1 person 24 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 8:40 pm I wish you success. Howard. Like 25 Kevin Crosado on September 26, 2023 at 5:29 am Reply “I wonder if an Illustrator PDF is different from a normal PDF, and if AI should be chosen instead of Illustrator PDF for layered designs.” My understanding is that an Illustrator PDF is a standard PDF with a native Illustrator version of the file embedded in it. The standard PDF part is used to display and work with a simplified version of the file in other apps (even in Adobe apps like Photoshop), while the Illustrator part allows Illustrator to fully access and work with the Illustrator-native parts of the file. Liked by 1 person 26 Volker on September 25, 2023 at 1:54 pm Reply Hi, that feels kind of sad for me, I’m using macs since the early 90’s, I’m into print-publishing. What does that mean for .eps files, with these I still work every day. I’m using adobe’s creative cloud, so I think they will continue to support .eps, but is it safe to do so? Liked by 1 person 27 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 2:50 pm Reply Yes, It’s a sad time, but I well understand Apple’s decision. If you’re using EPS with Adobe products, I expect that they rely on their own engine(s) to handle them. I still use Acrobat Pro, and won’t be abandoning that (much as I’d like to for reasons of cost). If you’re using EPS files created by others that could potentially be malicious, then I think you should be cautious with those. That said, I’m not aware of any malware yet that exploits any vulnerabilities in them or their rendering engines. So I don’t see any real need for change. Howard. Like 28 Volker on September 25, 2023 at 4:20 pm Reply Thanks for the heads up! Malicious eps files would be a real problem, because EPS used to be the gold-standard in file exchange across the whole prepress industry, at least in germany. And though many new fileformats are common now, there are lots of guys my age using .eps just by habit… Plus, the illustrator format itself (.ai) is as far as I know an .eps file wich has some proprietary extension… Liked by 1 person 29 conrad on September 25, 2023 at 9:02 pm I actually think it’s the opposite: Illustrator is a more modern and compatible format than EPS. Some years ago, the Adobe Illustrator file format was changed so that it is now based on PDF. An application that recognizes PDF should be able to display an Illustrator file that was saved with the “Create PDF Compatible File” option enabled, which I think is enabled by default. In contrast, EPS has numerous significant limitations involving fonts, transparency, color management, and more, most or all of which are solved in PDF. And because it was barely encapsulated PostScript code, most applications could not render it as is. That’s why many EPS files came with a rendered bitmap preview, but the low-res non-color-managed preview often looked terrible while also adding to the file size (lose/lose). So the industry deprecation of EPS in favor of Illustrator/PDF has done everyone a great service. Liked by 1 person 30 RalphB on September 25, 2023 at 9:14 pm Reply Because no one has (yet) mentioned this, I’ll just note that the Affinity suite (Photo, Publisher and Designer) currently still support both import and export of EPS files. Perhaps that will be removed following Apple’s lead, I suppose. I have found the Affinity suite to be a wonderful, capable, and less costly substitute for Adobe’s high-priced and frequently-updated-for-security-reasons software. (I have no affiliation with Affinity, other than as a paying customer.) Liked by 1 person 31 hoakley on September 25, 2023 at 9:33 pm Reply Thank you. A very good question, and I can’t find any information about their compatibility with Sonoma. The situation is fairly straightforward. If an app relies on Quartz (Core Graphics) to perform rendering or conversion of PostScript or EPS, that will cease working in Sonoma. If the app uses a different engine, such as Ghostscript or Adobe’s Distiller, then it won’t be affected. There aren’t many other engines around, although I have heard of some claimed to have been developed in China and elsewhere, but I don’t know whether other well-known products might use them. I don’t think this affects generation of PostScript or EPS output, which doesn’t use PSNormalizer, nor PostScript or EPS that’s sent direct to a PostScript printer. Howard. Like 32 Brian Reiter on September 25, 2023 at 11:07 pm Reply Postscript is not just a complex vector image format to parse. It is a Turing-complete programming language vaguely similar to Forth and Lisp. Every PS and EPS file is not just an image, it’s a program that executes.

Also, the PDFs created by Quartz PDFContext is often needlessly large and tools like pdftk have been able to losslessly compress them, whereas Quartz&#x27; own compression filter seems like the equivalent of JPEG compression at quality 0.The only practical advantage of PDF to me is the presence of an alpha channel, but that is basically it.

Images decoders have a long history of being exploit vectors that are very hard to close. At a certain point simply not shipping them is the best course of action, doesn’t prevent people from adding them later, but at least only those who need the functionality are in the firing line (which reduces the incentive for exploiting those formats, and indirectly ends up providing further protection to those that need to work with the formats).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;messages-blastdoor-ios-... reply Tobu 18 minutes agoparentprevI was thinking of that around the \"stack-based interpreted language\" paragraph.

The goal of this is explicitly to use their monopsony power to transfer wealth from the workers to the investors at the expense of product quality (since they will lose some people that they need to keep the lights on).These firms also happen to hold monopolies in many areas, so the amount of product enshitification the market will bear is practically unlimited.The wage fixing and enshitification halves of this scheme are probably both in violation of anti-trust law, though enforcement of the law in either way would probably be novel.

The disconnect is that \"Conservatives\" think it is completely unfounded because they are incapable of self reflection. \"Conservatives\" feel that their entire ideology is being unfairly attacked by global Jewish power brokers while ignoring the blatant racist white nationalist venom spitting maggots infesting their ranks.I say \"Conservatives\" because they aren&#x27;t true conservatives and haven&#x27;t held or are sacrificing most of those ideals for decades to \"own the libs\". Politics in America are no longer a divide between about progressive vs conservative ideals, but rather between a divide between those that would embrace people who are different and those that would rather hurt them.Modern \"Conservatives\" are so blinded by hate that they are willing to forgo Individual Freedom, Limited Government, Fiscal Responsibility, and Human Dignity to hurt others.

Much of the tech industry is unprofitable, so where does the money come from? It comes from the investments into the company. That money comes from venture capitalists, but not out of their actual pockets. Their money comes from their limited partners -- pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, insurance companies, etc. Even when it comes to profitable companies, like Microsoft, folks should understand that the people who pull the strings in the industry are the investors. AKA the owners of the company. Yesterday&#x27;s investors generally get paid by tomorrow&#x27;s. When there&#x27;s uncertainty of future investment, things change real quick.For a long period of time, we were in a zero-interest rate regime, and the investor class was obsessed with growth, over all else. Capital is easy to come by when interest rates are low, so the game they are playing is to try to pick sectoral winners, and worry about profitability in the long run. You can&#x27;t win in the market without the best talent, and so there was an arms race to acquire that talent. Investors will endure dilution from employee stock grants as long as the growth makes up for it.When interest rates started increasing, to combat inflation, everything changed. Capital was no longer cheap and businesses needed to be able to become self-sustaining, or risk going bankrupt. It&#x27;s hard to overstate how sharp a change this was from years of declining interest rates.Some leaders of companies are sociopaths, and others are great humans. In the end, both types of leaders need to be responsive to three forces: capital markets, supply chain markets, and customer markets. The latter two are peculiar to each business, but the macro capital market dynamics are pretty much shared. And that&#x27;s why it seems like we&#x27;ve seen herd behavior among investors and executives.But I think it&#x27;s important to be able to parse between what behaviors is vicious&#x2F;selfish&#x2F;exploitative vs. that which responding to changing market forces. I do think that when it&#x27;s all said and done, we&#x27;ll see which CEOs are actually able to guide their companies to produce value, and which CEOs just know how to do well with a tailwind. reply kridsdale3 15 hours agoparentBuffet&#x27;s \"When the tide goes out\" line is something I thought of often during our Bull Decade.

It&#x27;s my own insurance policy.I started my career in 2008, and I talked to a lot of guys who started theirs in 2000. I have played defensively since then.

Good Engineers(in the US, EU etc) who command this will leave. You can be a dollar printing tech company and have good engineers but you can&#x27;t be small. A lot of the economy and US tech dominance is alive because of such jobs and the larger ecosystem of evaluations(linked to GDP) that support this.At the macro level the size of big tech is supported by evaluations: \"How much it would cost to make the same thing?\". This evaluation includes payroll costs. Those payroll costs are kept artificially high so that evaluations(in dollars) are high. the obscene salaries also keep the $ cost that companies charge for products, goods and services((daycare, medicine, labor, homes)) high which keep the evaluation high. You need the high evaluation to award Engineers wanting all those 400K+ salaries.Also at this macro level the dollarized based evaluation is critical because with US&#x27;s dollar dominance it can just spend to eliminate any and all competition. The government can borrow endlessly by selling debt(or so it seems).So the key support thesis behind big tech is that if you can keep enough people, rich enough they will continue to buy and spend to support dollar evaluation of companies.

You&#x27;re putting someone who has 30+ years of career growth against someone out of high school and then screaming about wealth disparity.The article itself even points this out - they say most of the loss of money in middle income was made up for in the 45-65 year old bracket. After 65 (surprise) when folks are retired, this drops off.The issue isn&#x27;t some sort of \"class warfare\" boogeyman. The issue is that we&#x27;ve made it damn near impossible to have a large family these days, and our population demographics are reflecting that, along with income.Also note: the article doesn&#x27;t talk about absolute numbers or wealth.

Labor loses their livelihood.You might be able to make a compelling argument that, as the people pushing that automation forward, high-paid software developers are class traitors, like cops.

    "originBody": "Matt's Dumb Musings BLOG CONTACT The Casino in Your Pocket 15-09-23 A very rough statistical analysis of a casino trick used by games on your phone (n=28). tl;dr: It's all rigged! [Clutches pearls, faints] Introduction to the Game Wordscapes is a well-known simple, addictive, and fun word-based game on mobile devices. The core gameplay is very simple: Use a set of available letters to compose proper words to solve a crossword-like puzzle. It has a thriving community of players which can congregate in teams and compete in tournaments. The Setup Like any modern mobile game worth its monetization, the game offers awards, hints, and other decorations to enhance the game experience. They're occasionally gifted for free (and ostensibly at random), but of course are also available for purchase with their in-game currency, coins. Coins are slowly earned by playng the main game. Also unsurprisingly, coins are available for purchase with real money from your phone. The game frequently pushes ads in your face to buy coins, lest you accidentally forget they're available. In-app game microtransactions are an absolutely gigantic industry, so a mobile game with real-money purchases truly has only one mission -- to convince you to spend your money on in-game currency. Wordscapes regularly rolls out new bells and whistles to engage the player and unlock new in-game decorations. Mt. Fortune - Welcome to the Gaming Floor The newest iteration in this monetization/reward system is called \"Mt. Fortune\", an mini-game of chance* where the player ascends a \"mountain\" of 25 steps. At each step, four cards are presented to the player. The layout of the Mt. Fortune interface. After you choose a card, all four are revealed. Three of the cards contain a reward, and one of them contains a \"rock\", halting your progress. The player is free to exit with their rewards after any step, unless they reveal a rock. They are then presented with an ultimatum: Abandon all your collected rewards, or pay coins to continue on. Each time this happens, the number of coins required to continue increases, to an upper threshold of 1200. The decision. Pay and continue, or lose it all? It's a very effective means of investing the player into the process, extracting their in-game currency in order to continue enhancing their experience. Something's Not Right Given that one is presented with four cards, one being a hazard, the assumption would be that on any non-\"basecamp\" step (steps divisible by 5 have no rock hazard) would confer a 25% chance of getting a rock and forcing you to pay to continue. As you will see below, this is very much not the case. After noticing some general patterns of rock appearance, my curiosity was piqued. The Scam, Visualized To test this, I created a spreadsheet. For 28 consecutive days, I played the game in full; paying to continue when a rock appeared, until I reached the end. (This cost me a lot of coins!) To control for selection bias, I randomized (RANDBETWEEN(1,4)) the card to choose and recorded the result of my choice for each step: rock or no rock. Much credit to my big-brained data analyst wife for the fancy charts. The result of which card I chose didn't really affect whether it was a rock: Which card you choose does not seem to affect whether a rock appears or not. Also, when looking at each day's play, the number of rocks wasn't constant but was pretty consistent. It's interesting to know that in every case, the percentage of cards which exposed a rock was at least 25%, sometimes as high as 45%! (Remember, \"basecamp\" cards at positions 5,10,15,20, and 25 can't have rocks): Some days, the game likes giving you more rocks than others. But never fewer! But the truly telling chart is the position in which rocks tend to appear: Rocks sure do love to appear right before and after those basecamp stations! Whoa. Nothing creates a sense of urgency like snatching away your rewards right before or after a basecamp, and the stakes sure do get high near the end. It should also be noted that the farther you ascend up the steps, the \"better\" the rewards get. As you get up the mountain, you're virtually guaranteed to have your haul held hostage. Nobody said this would be easy! According to me, it would seem that the \"safest\" strategy to reap rewards with the lowest risk of spending coins would be to play through step 8 and then cash out. Or, you can plow on, flinging worthless in-game currency to the tune of 70,000 coins. It's for science, right? What's Really Happening? The answer is obvious to programmers, but maybe not anybody else: When the cards are shown to you on the screen, their contents are not yet determined. When you tap one of the cards, the content to be revealed is calculated at that moment by an algorithm. The game chooses what to show you, based on its instructions. If the programmer said \"show them a rock at step 19 today\", that's what you're going to get. Your choice of card has no bearing on the outcome. Just like a magician uses sleight-of-hand to dupe you, these games use visual deception to accomplish their goal. Conclusion I'm sure this doesn't come as much of a surprise to anybody that the game is rigged in the house's favor. The choice presented to the player is entirely an illusion, masked as a game of chance. In a casino, any rational adult expects this. For games which allow real-money purchases in the hands of players of any age? Well, we can discuss the morality of that another day. In the meantime, I'll be killing my time with mindless word puzzles.",

To crave the instant gratification, the high of risk taking etc.I think the time has come when android and ios should make a special versions of their online shops for children and teenagers and simply ban those types of games from those shops. This will at least prevent children from having their brains rewired. Of course this will remove the vast majority of games from the online shops, but so be it.I remember my experience with these types of games. I wasted a lot of time and got a lot of needless frustration but I never once paid those bastards a single cent. There was a game called Candy Crush Saga. It was very popular in its day. Their in game super power currency was something called \"lollipop hammers.\" They made one candy disappear. It seemed a pretty simple game, assuming the game boards (i.e., the candys) were randomly generated, but of course they weren&#x27;t. They were carefully created so that they present problems that are very difficult to solve under the game&#x27;s usual rules but were easy and downright delightful to solve using a lollipop hammer.I would look at the gameboard for a long time and imagine all the great combos I would achieve, if I could only get rid of a single pesky candy, but alas, one had to use a lollipop hammer for that. I actually ended up having a lot of respect for the designers, it was not easy to design a board that would be incredibly difficult unless one candy was removed but if that candy was removed, it would all solve itself in an explosion of combos and extra points.I was very proud that I solved so many of these boards without using a single lollipop hammer. But my reward would always be a board that is even harder and where the temptation to use the hammer was even greater. Eventually I decided that this is simply torture. I did not mind hard puzzles, I liked solving hard puzzles, but the temptation of the lollipop hammer being always there and me having to constantly use willpower to avoid clicking on those hammers made the whole experience miserable.So quit and deleted the game, but I can proudly say that I never paid for a single lollipop hammer and I left 8 of the 10 hammers you get for free unused. I hope some random King employee looked at my cancelled account with so many puzzles solved and yet so few lollipop hammers used and felt a little pang of defeat. But I doubt it. reply chucky_z 4 hours agoparentApple Arcade allows these types of games and removes all monetization like this.

If it looks like a die in a game of chance then it is a fair die. If it looks like a deck of cards, it is a fair deck of cards.

There&#x27;s simply no way. There is no one responsible for that. There is no customs office checking goods (apps) imported to the EU. And the same is true for casino apps.So, the solution might be to force Apple&#x2F;Google to comply with all local laws for all apps in the stores. Sounds like a lot of work, but that&#x27;s the only way. After all, if you buy in-app-items, Apple&#x2F;Google are the sellers, not the app developers.

You could spin the wheel for free once per day and get some sort of in-game resource, but you had unlimited spins if you paid coins, which, you guessed it, costed real moneyz.There was a huge uproar from the community stating that the game was now pay-to-win and virtually unplayable otherwise and they had to reverse the change.

Few things are as simple as they appear, but from the mobile games I have seen, they look like they could be put together by tiny development teams: simplistic (+recyclable) art and rules. Once the foundational app is created, feels like the further development could happen on a shoe string budget: artist to make new cosmetics and&#x2F;or someone to develop additional puzzles.

Basically everything a fleecing game needs. They even offer templates inspired in famous games to get you started and tune as you go.They charge quite a bit, but the \"foundational app\" upfront cost is much lower: it&#x27;s limited to UI and a relatively thin business logic that targets their API endpoint (mostly mapping API ids to in-game assets and use or server-side logic). reply kioleanu 1 hour agorootparentprevI am assuming they had pretty high costs, more than 120 employees working on more than 10 different games, none of which was profitable.

The author surmises that this game has something more like a loss rate at pre-determined points.Would such a machine be legal in the regulated real-world? Or only in the wild-west of online casinos? reply TylerE 6 hours agoparentAbsolutely not. Nevada requires two things that are very important:1. Anything that appears to be a representation of a physical object or device must behave exactly as the thing it represents. So, like in this case of the article if you have 4 cards, one of which has a rock behind them, each must have exactly a 1&#x2F;4 chance of containing the rock. Wether this is pre-determined or after the choice is made is irrelevant if the odds are fair.2. Any manufacturer selling games to Nevada must abide by the Nevada rules for any machine they sell anywhere in the world, so no switching a machine out for something that looks the same but operates differently.It should also be noted that there is a seperate class of machines called \"pull tabs\" that are legal in some jurisdictions (often found in places like gas stations and bars) that often present as a slot machine or video poker, but actually work more like a lottery scratch off - the result is 100% pre-determined, and any agency the player appears to be given is an illusion. So, like, if you hit the jackpot on a video poker (like) machine, and get given a royal flush on the initial deal, even if you discard all 5 cards you&#x27;ll get another royal flush on the draw. reply Eji1700 6 hours agorootparentVegas really is very well regulated. There are some extremely ugly sides to gambling, but if you&#x27;re going to have it, vegas is a pretty good starting point for how to try and keep things under control.There&#x27;s no casino in town that will \"look the other way\" for a few 20 year olds who want to gamble, because doing it once could lose that operation it&#x27;s gaming license.There&#x27;s no casino that&#x27;s going to on purpose risk going above the 25% max hold, because again, you could lose the ENTIRE OPERATION.The rules are rock solid (sorta....simplifying) and heavily enforced, and while at the end of the day all the machines give worse odds than the ATM, there&#x27;s caps on what you can and can&#x27;t do.Somewhat ironically, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s changed, but if a slot machine shows you a \"pick 1 of 3\" choice, it&#x27;s never a real choice. The decision was made before you picked. Every \"pull\" of the lever determines your payout basically instantly, ALL the shenanigans after that (including free auto play games i believe) are just placebo&#x2F;different ways of doing a jackpot. reply leghifla 4 hours agorootparentThese shenanigans before displaying the final result can have quite a lot of psychologic effects.Back when I started programming, I did simulate a jackpot machine in software (no money involved). The final probabilities were fair, but I added a twist while rolling the images: before stopping, the probability of having 2 or 3 of the same image was quite significant... My younger brother was instantly hooked to it. The trick made him overestimate the probability of having 3 images the same, as he was seeing this pattern quite often just before stopping.

If Vegas&#x27;s reputation is ruined, overall traffic to casinos in general would decline.If Vegas were to allow casino cheating (i.e. by refusing to regulate), if Casino A is revealed to have been cheating, then a player who plays and loses at (actually) honest casino B might have doubt (unreasonable as it may be) that their losses are legitimate. They may decide to make a fuss, complain, broadcast to their social networks that their losses were due to casino cheating. Even if casino B was actually honest, casino B now needs to constantly defends its reputation for fair play. At best, this represents an ongoing cost; at worst, casino B will lose all its traffic due to rumors that spin out of control. An honest reputation is indefensible in such an environment.The most profitable arrangement for all casinos involved is to prioritize long-term profits and cooperate with strong policing, such that Vegas as a whole (and thereby their casino individually as well) is publically perceived as offering fair odds. reply jstanley 1 hour agorootparentprevAnd yet people still go to casinos instead of standing alone in the street, so it can&#x27;t be as simple as that. reply gpxyz 4 hours agorootparentprevUnless the same company[0] owns both Casino A and Casino B[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vici_Properties reply somerandomqaguy 3 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t they?Let&#x27;s say I rig the slot machines so that they can win on command, and then I hire a couple of actors to come in once every two or three days to &#x27;win&#x27; a jackpot.

Note: I&#x27;ve been out of this industry for at least 15 years, so some of my knowledge might have aged, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that it&#x27;s still true in the general sense.First, under federal regulations, there are three classes of gambling. First, class I, which is basically, \"I make a wager with you over the outcome of a sporting event\". So if I&#x27;m playing golf with you and I bet you $10 a hole on outcome, that&#x27;s class I. It&#x27;s not regulated at federal level, and not generally regulated at state level.The next class is Class II. This covers things like raffles, and mid-week church bingo. There are some limits, but it&#x27;s not regulated by the states generally, and not by the feds at all.Class III is what we think of as traditional gambling. Table games, traditional slot machines, etc. This is absolutely regulated by the states, and only allowed if the states allow it. This is what your Vegas and Atlantic City casinos operate under.But there are Indian casinos outside of this in these markets operating. How do they operate, you ask? The simple answer is, if the games are operating as Class I or (more likely) class II games, the states have no say in them. And it&#x27;s very easy to make a lotto drawing, or a bingo card, appear as a slot machine play. All random wins are basically equivalent to each other. If you go to an Indian casino, and you want to play a slot machine, but it&#x27;s requiring you to wait on another player, you&#x27;re dealing with a class II machine.What about class III? Well, states are allowed to negotiate compacts with the various Native American tribes where they allow them to conduct class III games. A number of states have done this. This allows them to run, say, blackjack and poker, as well as slot machines that don&#x27;t fall under class II. Interestingly, in a lot of jurisdictions, you&#x27;re still basically following the ideas of class II, but just not requiring competition. So if you go to a casino in Oklahoma, you&#x27;ll see that you are (most often) playing a game of instant bingo on each spin, or possibly a game of instant lotto on each spin. Because that&#x27;s what the compact between the state of Oklahoma and the tribes there allows.But there are still loopholes that allow you, in some jurisdictions, to run slot machines outside of these provisions. Let&#x27;s say, you&#x27;re allowed to run raffles that allow up to a $1000 prize on a $1 entry. These are just numbers to use to illustrate the concept, and they vary state to state. So I set up a slot machine that you pay $1 a spin, which is an entry in a lotto that pays maximum $1000, and after the total number of tickets allocated is depleted, will pay the house 10%. Perfectly legal, though local law enforcement in the bible belt in the south may disagree. I&#x27;ve coded a number of systems that implemented exactly this.Other jurisdictions may allow you to have prizes up to, say, 25x the entry on machines, to allow the legality of the claw machines. This can also be (ab)used to make slot machines. reply spondylosaurus 3 hours agorootparent> If you go to an Indian casino, and you want to play a slot machine, but it&#x27;s requiring you to wait on another player, you&#x27;re dealing with a class II machine.This is all really interesting, but I don&#x27;t think I follow on this point (and I&#x27;d like to understand!)—are you saying that two players are playing on different machines, but the second machine can&#x27;t operate until the first is done? Are they relying on each other&#x27;s outcomes to calculate odds or something like that? reply skipkey 2 hours agorootparentExactly. There is a server which is drawing bingo balls, against a card. Someone is going to eventually win. So if there is only one player, you will eventually win.You can actually set up a situation where one player is guaranteed a win, which is why the systems will require at least two players. reply canjobear 4 hours agorootparentprevI gambled in Vegas at age 20. reply narag 4 hours agoparentprevWould such a machine be legal in the regulated real-world?I live in Spain.

Now we can find console and PC games with random \"gift boxes\", daily XP limits to force you to keep playing and others.Not that it should be blamed fully on mobile, it was already getting worse on itself, with cosmetic paid \"DLC\" that could be (and sometimes is) present on the base game files at release but exists purely for monetization purposes (Oblivion&#x27;s horse armor) or exclusives limited to a certain retailer.There are several concerns with dark patterns that we have to pay attention nowadays, specially when children are exposed to these games, which did not exist in the past. reply ilrwbwrkhv 5 hours agorootparentI will just drop this very old Jonathan Blow video https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RsT-5VSqk8I which was talking about unethical games. reply kmeisthax 5 hours agorootparentprevConsole and (non-MMO) PC gaming up until the 360 and PS3 was an unusual time of transparent and straightforward monetization.

I played Animal Crossing: New Horizons regularly for about two years of the pandemic, and there were only two possible places to buy anything: the original game purchase for $60, and one optional expansion pack released 18 months later for $25.

So there probably are some great mobile games out there, just buried in the charts under what the masses preferred. What&#x27;s most popular on mobile is going to be a reflection of a very different demographic&#x27;s interests. Kind of like trying to find the \"best\" movie from box office charts, you will get a list of the most popular movied, not the best. reply squeaky-clean 3 hours agorootparentprevMobile is really tough to monetize the way console&#x2F;desktop can monetize. If you were to make an app which is identical across desktop and mobile, you would neged to charge less for the mobile version because people don&#x27;t value a mobile app as much. This is even true in cases where a mobile version is superior to desktop, such as star tracking apps.The mobile market figured out[0] a way to monetize a customer base where the median will not pay, but the mean will. Unfortunately, the method they figured out is really harmful and really profitable. Profitable enough that other platforms are copying it.[0] Technically many Asian MMOs were already doing this for a while before mobile apps existed.

Easy way to part them from their real earnings that way.There&#x27;s easy money here if you are ruthless. If you print your own crypto for their habits, you can effectively act like the US Fed.

See our page Postage Stamps to learn more about these and also the island’s early postal history. You may also be interested in our collection of St Helena postcards. We can send and receive post, both letters and small packages (larger packages require sea freight). The correct postal address for sending things to St Helena is: Recipient’s Name House Name or ‘Near …’ (few St Helena houses have numbers - see our page Houses and Housing) Area (e.g. Jamestown / Half Tree Hollow) Island of St Helena STHL 1ZZ South Atlantic Ocean Note that the postcode (‘zip code’) ‘STHL 1ZZ’ applies to the entire island, and also that the ‘South Atlantic Ocean’, while strictly unnecessary, does seem to help prevent letters being routed to California, South Carolina or Australia! Some people have Post Office Boxes, as we do. There is no letter delivery to your home or office - you have to collect your letter from the main Post Office in Jamestown or from a shop near your home - so a Post Office Box is easier and more reliable. Our address is: P.O. Box 37, Jamestown, Island of St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean, STHL 1ZZ Note that, although 5,000 miles from the UK, St Helena has a UK postcode - STHL 1ZZ. This was introduced because mail for St Helena was regularly being routed to St Helens in Merseyside, UK. If sending mail to St Helena it is best to complete a customs declaration at the sending post office. By declaring that the contents are of ‘no commercial value’{4} you may save the recipient from having to open the packet at the Post Office here so that its contents can be examined and assessed for import duty. For our contact details please see our page Contact Us. DELIVERY TO/FROM ST HELENA Your letter or parcel is first routed to the UK. From there it is routed to Johannesburg, South Africa, and thence to St Helena. After mail arrives on a flight it can take several working days to make it into post boxes. For bulkier items see below. POSTING FROM ST HELENA When sending post from St Helena you need to take your letter or parcel to the Post Office in Jamestown, open normal office hours - there are no letter boxes around the island. At the Post Office they will provide you with a customs form and sell you the appropriate stamp. You can then drop your letter into the posting box in the Post Office building. ST HELENA INTERNAL POST You will see from the above that there is no point whatsoever in posting a letter in St Helena to a St Helena destination{27}. Government departments and larger local businesses employ messengers. Smaller businesses and individuals deliver their post by hand (though these days a lot goes by email). Read about Our first Air-Mail, which preceded the Airport by around 50 years… NO LONGER ‘ROYAL’ Since the final departure on 10th February 2018 of the RMS St Helena (1990-2018), mail for St Helena is no longer designated ‘Royal’. It’s now just ‘Mail’. It’s still handled by the Post Office (part of the Government of St Helena), but it no longer has the stamp of royalty. 2: FREIGHT IN THIS SECTION: Sea Freight Air Freight SEA FREIGHT MV Maria da Paz{b} With effect from January 2023 the Sea Freight service is operated by Meihuizen International, using the ship MV Maria da Paz{6}. The service operates to a roundabout route: The MV Maria da Paz is based in Luanda, Angola. She sails from there to Walvis Bay (port) where she picks up the cargo for St Helena. After being unloaded here, empty containers (and any with goods from St Helena, which is rare) are then transported back to Luanda in Angola. The reason for this circuitous route is that Walvis Bay (port) cannot handle the return of the empty containers into the international shipping routes; Luanda can. This service will operate until January 2024 while a more permanent service is established. The MV Maria da Paz is expected to call at St Helena approximately every six weeks. The incoming ship docks at the new jetty in Ruperts (but at the time of writing is not unloaded there - see below). The ship also serves Ascension Island, and has a small number of passenger cabins available for those who prefer not to or cannot travel by air. To send packages to St Helena contact Richard James International Ltd., Chittening Ind. Est., Bristol BS11 0YB, United Kingdom; +44 117 982 8575. Inauguration The first Sea Freight service was operated by AW Ship Management Ltd.. The MV Helena{7} sailed from Cape Town to St Helena and back, with a capacity of approx. 250 TEU on a four-weekly cycle. Commencement of the service was officially supposed to await the retirement of the RMS St Helena (1990-2018), but actually the RMS St Helena (1990-2018) suffered engine problems in March/April 2017 and missed an entire voyage so the MV Helena made a single trip, arriving on 3rd April with 698.36 tonnes of cargo. The MV Helena made her first official voyage for St Helena in March 2018, leaving Cape Town on 1st and arriving at St Helena on the 7th, docking at the new jetty in Ruperts. Because the infrastructure wasn’t yet ready she could not be unloaded onto the jetty - the cargo had to be lifted by the ship’s cranes onto waiting Lighters and carried round to the Jamestown wharf! Unloading At the time of writing the Ruperts Jetty has still not commenced operations, so cargo continues to be lifted by the ship’s cranes onto waiting Lighters and carried round to the Jamestown wharf for landing. History Previously all freight was carried to and from St Helena by the RMS St Helena (1990-2018). Prior to that it was carried by ships of the Union Castle Line, and before that by the many ships that called at St Helena, military and civilian. AIR FREIGHT The international courier service DHL has an operation here - DHL St Helena Express Limited. This can ship packages to or from St Helena on every flight, which makes it possible for an item to travel from anywhere in the world to St Helena (or vice-versa) in days rather than months. In October 2017 Solomons announced that from 4th November it would be operating an Air Freight service between St Helena and South Africa. Few details were announced but a contact was provided: freightagent@solomons.co.sh. 3: TELEPHONES For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk and we learned to listen.{c} Fixed-line and mobile (‘cell’) telephone services on St Helena are currently provided by Sure under an exclusive monopoly contract with the Government of St Helena. IN THIS SECTION: Calling to St Helena Calling from and within St Helena Telephone History Radio Telephones Mobile Telephones Text Messaging CALLING TO ST HELENA The international dialling code for calls to St Helena is 290{8}. In most countries, St Helena is treated as a ‘high-cost destination’ and you may need to contact your telephone service provider to get calls to St Helena un-barred. If you don’t know the number of the person you want to call, and your local international directory enquiries can’t help, call (+290) 22222 (08:30 - 16:00h GMT Monday to Friday) and the Sure Operator will help (but only from 08:30 - 16:00h GMT Monday to Friday). The telephone directory is available online. In 2021 90% of St Helena households had a fixed-line telephone{d}. St Helena is on GMT with no daylight saving time: St Helena Local Time (GMT) is 10:35:46 on Tuesday 26th September 2023{9} Your timezone is 7 hours behind St Helena time For our contact details please see our page Contact Us. CALLING FROM AND WITHIN ST HELENA St Helena has its own automated telephone exchange which can route calls locally or overseas. For local calls dial the five-digit number{10} (there are no area codes). For international calls dial ‘00’ followed by the country code and telephone number - on some telephones international calls may be barred because of the expense{11}. You can reach the operator and local directory enquiries on (+290) 22222 (08:30 - 16:00h GMT Monday to Friday). In an emergency: Dial (+290) 999 for fire, police, ambulance or other emergency. There are payphones and telephone kiosks around the island; these take cash or telephone cards (which can be purchased at the offices of Sure in Jamestown - open normal office hours - and some other shops, also mostly in Jamestown). A few payphones accept credit cards. TELEPHONE HISTORY Old switchboard, in use until 1983, now in the Museum of St Helena GPO telegraph insulator{1}{e} Prior to the installation of the first telephone system the island had an internal telegraph service, primarily for military purposes but with use extended to the civilian population. The system was set up in 1866 with the maximum length of a single message set at 25 words. In 1880 a message of 10 words sent from lower Jamestown to Maldivia Gardens would have cost 1s (£0.05). Only individuals paid for Telegrams - Government and Military messages were sent free. Telephones were introduced to St Helena by the War Office in 1898, to improve communications with the island’s many lookout posts and signal stations. Control was transferred to the Government of St Helena in 1906 but in 1907 due to financial difficulties the system almost closed and was taken over privately. In 1914 there were 17 telephones, and The ‘Blue Book’ for 1928 records that the telephone system had 33 instruments and 41 miles of wire. The profit for the year was £39. The system was taken over by the Government of St Helena in 1953. In the 1960s there was one telephone exchange, at Ladder Hill Fort, with a single operator who connected all calls. Dr. Ian Baker, writing in ‘One Man’s Island’ and recalling a visit in the 1960s reports: The Consulate had a telephone, but you didn’t just dial a number. You picked up the telephone and waited. After a brief chat with the operator she asked you who you wanted. Not a number or even a house; the name of the person. The response might be So-and-so? I just saw him go by so I’ll call him for you in twenty minutes when he gets to his office. Or maybe So-and-so? No, not today, lovie. He’s gone fishing. In 1973 a Business Line cost per month was £0.83 and a residential line per month was £0.67. In The ‘Blue Book’ for 1970/3 it is reported that: The telephone system now comprises some five route miles of multi-core cable supported on the electricity supply poles and some thirteen and a half route miles of open bare-wire lines on telephone poles. These figures exclude individual service lines. Service in Jamestown and in the adjacent country areas is given from the cable system and it is planned to replace, eventually, all open trunk lines by supported multi-core cables. The present Manual Exchange at Ladder Hill Fort has a capacity of 120 lines. This Exchange at present controls 65 subscribers on direct lines and 131 subscribers on party lines. There are 52 party lines. The Manual Exchange is very fully loaded and as a result development of the telephone service is restricted. There are at present 11 public telephones available, two in Jamestown and the remainder in the rural areas, from which some 1,400 calls are handled annually. The system remained manual until 1983. Due to the shortage of exchange lines, many people used a shared line (‘Party Line’) and there was an ingenious system for the parties to know for whom was an incoming call: one ring for party 1; two rings for party 2; etc., sometimes with as many as five parties sharing a line. The potential for error was immense! This ended when the island’s first automated telephone exchange was commissioned on 16th April 1983 at an installation cost of £100,000. At commissioning the system had 488 active telephones (and a capacity for 600) with three-digit telephone numbers. Governor Massingham made the first automatically-handled telephone call to George Stevens, Manager of the Government Telephone System. The first public telephone, at White Gate, was introduced in November the following year. The Government Telephone System was taken over by Cable & Wireless on 21st August 1989. The current PABX-based system went live over the weekend of 27-29th July 1990 and introduced International Direct Dialling and (unfortunately) local call charges. At this time the three-digit numbers were changed to four digits by adding a 2 for Jamestown numbers, a 3 for Half Tree Hollow and 4 for everywhere else. The new exchange initially gave capacity for 1,200 lines, but it was modular and was continually extended - by 2009 there were 2,900 lines in use. The four-digit numbers continued until 1st October 2013. From that date they all became five-digit by adding a 2 to the front (thus losing the regionalisation created in 1990). The new system designated 2xxxx numbers as landlines, 5xxxx numbers as mobile users on a contract and 6xxxx as mobile users with pay-as-you-go, though mobile telephones were not actually introduced until September 2015. Only these groupings were defined. RADIO TELEPHONES The first radio telephone link, between St Helena and Ascension Island, opened on 7th May 1957. This was followed by a link through to the UK (via Ascension Island) in October of the same year. A link to South Africa was launched ten years later in December 1967. This system remained in use until it was replaced by the (current) satellite-based system. MOBILE (‘CELL’) TELEPHONES A mobile telephone service came into operation on St Helena in September 2015 (the first call made was from Sure to the SAMS Radio 1 studio). The network is designed with a 2G GSM layer and a 4G LTE layer to support data services. Mobile numbers use the ranges 5XXXX and 6XXXX. Due to the topology of St Helena with deep valleys and guts, there will be some small areas with no coverage.{f} Sea coverage is not part of the planned coverage area. For pricing information please contact Sure. Roaming{12} was introduced shortly after service launch. Roaming handsets need to be 900MHz GSM and Band 3 1,800MHz LTE. Please Note users on Social Media in 2018 reported that roaming often does not work here, or is very expensive, but that most mobile telephones will accept a Sure SIM Card, which can be purchased at the airport or at their offices in Jamestown. In 2021 73.7% of St Helena households had access to a mobile phone{d}. Some satellite telephone systems also work here, with limited coverage. TEXT MESSAGING (SMS) Local SMS service was available at launch with international SMS available from November 2015. Hoever at the time of writing there is an unresolved incompatibility which means that SMS messages sent to St Helena mobile Devices from overseas are rarely received. 4: INTERNET AND EMAIL In the summer of 2016, the United Nations declared access to internet is a human right. While we are just beginning to realize the internet’s potential for our island and with the prospects of a high speed cable arriving on our shores, perhaps now is the time to re-evaluate the importance of information technology for EVERYONE. Can we truly reach our fullest potential if access to the World Wide Web is available only to those who can afford it?{g} IN THIS SECTION: Online Accessing the Internet in St Helena ‘Wi-Fi Hotspots’ ‘State of the Island’ report, 2015 Submarine Fibre Optic Cables Direct Satellite Link Services Internet History Internet Day Internet services on St Helena are currently provided by Sure under an exclusive monopoly contract with the Government of St Helena. ST HELENA ONLINE Many St Helena organisations have websites but this is far less common than in the UK or America. Local people will not use the Internet to find out local information - a telephone call is cheaper, or just ask a friend! Organisations tend to have websites only if they wish to communicate with Saints or Non-Saints overseas. A search on Google™ for ‘Saint Helena’ will bring up many sites that are in California, which has a town called ‘Saint Helena’, or South Carolina, which has an area known as ‘Saint Helena Island’. For this reason it is best when using Google™ to append to your search ‘-napa -carolina -california’, which will remove many of these irrelevant results. Sure’s 7.6m C-band dish for Intelsat 23 (Inst. 1989) You may find that websites hosted on St Helena are slower to respond than those hosted elsewhere. Our Internet link currently goes via satellite (Intelsat 23) and this is due to limited satellite capacity{13}. For our contact details please see our page Contact Us. ACCESSING THE INTERNET IN ST HELENA Inhabitants of the tiny tropical island of St Helena pay through the nose for an internet service that mainlanders would have considered painfully slow even during the pre-Netflix era.{h} However you connect, the Internet on St Helena is slow and expensive! For technical details and pricing information please contact Sure. Assuming you are a visitor you are best to access the Internet via your mobile (cell) Device. Otherwise you will not have a telephone account so will need to use one of the few Internet Kiosks, mostly in Jamestown, which are very expensive. If you are staying longer you can sign up for an Internet access package, billed on your telephone account (this should be available even if you are renting accommodation but check with your landlord). Broadband Internet was introduced in 2007, but be aware that data transfer speeds on St Helena are considerably slower than in most other countries and monthly data transfer limits are very low (for details see www.sure.co.sh/broadband/broadband-packages). In 2021 66% of St Helena households had Internet access{d}. An interesting feature of Internet connections on St Helena is that your location does not have a fixed IP Address. Each time you connect (and with the Internet so expensive and data allowances so restricted, being permanently connected is unthinkable) you are assigned the next available IP Address from the pool, so you are very unlikely to get the same one twice. This can cause problems with some web security systems, though it can also make it harder to track you online{14}. The Internet is slow and costly enough that only the most dedicated teenager keeps up on celebrity gossip{i} ‘WI-FI HOTSPOTS’ Because Internet access is so expensive on St Helena, and bandwidth so limited, the convention often found in the US and Europe whereby larger corporations{15} provide free Wi-Fi access to all comers just does not happen. Wi-Fi access is provided in a few locations (all of them at the time of writing in Jamestown) by Sure, but at a cost, usually charged to your Internet Account. See www.sure.co.sh/wifihotspots.html to learn more. ‘STATE OF THE ISLAND’ REPORT, 2015 St Helena’s isolation and reliance on satellite technology, means that internet services are limited and expensive compared to many countries, and are a major barrier to development. The top residential package offered in St Helena provides 13.3 megabytes of data at a speed of 1.5 megabits per second, and costs £180.50 per month. In comparison, unlimited broadband, at speeds 10 times faster than those available in St Helena, can cost less than £20 per month in the UK. However, starting from a low base, improvements have been made over the last three years in both price and quality. This is supporting the aim of a greater proportion of households and businesses having internet access. For each of the various broadband packages available, data allowances have more than doubled, download speeds have quadrupled and prices have fallen by 23%. Figure 11 illustrates the changes seen in two popular packages - Gold (£92 per month) and Bronze (£23 per month).{j} 66% of households have Internet access via a wired connection (62.4%) or via a Mobile Phone (24.0%) or both{d}. There’s a statistical theory that if you gave a million monkeys typewriters and set them to work, they’d eventually come up with the complete works of Shakespeare. Thanks to the Internet, we now know this isn’t true.{k} SUBMARINE FIBRE OPTIC CABLES Although two submarine fibre optic cable projects began in the South Eastern Atlantic in the 2010s, both coming close to St Helena, only one actually progressed. The island is being connected to this one - the Equiano Cable. Such a connection could dramatically improve Internet services on St Helena at a fraction of the cost, and also services based on the Internet including telephones, by removing the inevitable constrains imposed by a satellite connection. Equiano Equiano™ is a subsea cable from Portugal to South Africa, owned and operated by Google™, according to whom: Named for Olaudah Equiano, a Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist who was enslaved as a boy, the Equiano cable is state-of-the-art infrastructure based on space-division multiplexing (SDM) technology, with approximately 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve this region. In July 2019 the Government of St Helena announced that it has issued a letter of intent to connect the island to Equiano. The 1,140Km branch to Saint Helena was completed in 2021 so this cable will provide the first fibre optic connectivity from St Helena to the outside world through both Europe and South Africa. Compared to the current satellite link the cable will bring almost incredible amounts of capacity. The Government of St Helena estimates that it will deliver several hundred gigabits per second - far more than the island’s population of around 4,400 people{16} could possibly use. The plan is therefore to turn the island into a communications hub, with satellites in space linking via groundstations on the island to the world via the cable. The Government of St Helena believes St Helena’s position in the South Atlantic and its political and physical stability make it an ideal and almost unique location for this use. A route survey was conducted in August 2019 and at the end of the year the Government of St Helena announced that it had signed an agreement with Google™ to land the cable at St Helena, aiming to commence service in 2022. On 6th February 2020 Sure announced that it had no plans to upgrade domestic and small-business Internet connections to Fibre-Optic when the Equiano Cable arrives in 2022, meaning ordinary users would not see the full benefits of the new system. It was announced on 2nd November 2020 that the island’s link to the cable would be via Telecom Egypt. The St Helena Government was granted funding by the 11th European Development Fund in February 2018 for a sub-marine fibre optic cable to the island and is responsible for managing the project. It signed a contract with Google™ in December 2019 for the construction of the cable that will branch off the main Equiano cable running between Portugal and South Africa. The St Helena Government owns the branch and is responsible for developing the cable landing station. Its key objective is to ensure all residents on St Helena have access to reliable, high capacity bandwidth at affordable prices{17} and plans to introduce a regulator to enforce Key Performance Indicators which will be provided for in the new telecoms licence that will come into force on 1st January 2023. It is also working towards earth stations, digital businesses and digital nomads being located on the island, and for this additional demand for services to assist in the lowering of prices for residents. The cable, along with the associated high speed internet, is scheduled to be operational in 2022.{l} The ‘Modular Cable Landing Station’ arrived by Sea Freight on 16th March 2021. Engineers to fit it had arrived on a previous flight. The cable itself arrived on 29th August 2021 - see images below{b}: More about Equiano at cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/introducing-equiano-a-subsea-cable-from-portugal-to-south-africa. DIRECT SATELLITE LINK SERVICES IN THIS SECTION: ‘Starlink’ ‘OneWeb’ ‘Cease & Desist’ ‘Starlink’ People on St Helena are now able to connect to the Internet via the Starlink service. The system offers a direct-to-consumer Internet service delivered from a vast network of low-earth-orbit satellites. Speeds and data quantities would reach those that could be achieved by direct connection to The Cable, but without the need to wait for Maestro to be rolled out across the entire island. Currently Sure has a monoply contract with the Government of St Helena for the provision of Internet services and under this it is not clear whether it would be legal for a consumer to use Starlink. Examination of the SURE exclusive licence suggests that, if an offence is committed by somebody using Starlink, it is Starlink that commits it (by providing the service), not the consumer who receives it, but this has not been tested. It is also possible that the Government of St Helena, to protect its investment in Maestro, might outright ban the use of Starlink systems, though exactly how this might be enforced is not clear. At the time of writing it is believed that some individuals and businesses are already successfully using StarLink on St Helena{18}. ‘OneWeb’ It has been noted that people on St Helena should be able to connect to the Internet via the OneWeb service, once this is fully operational. The system offers a direct-to-consumer Internet service delivered from a vast network of low-earth-orbit satellites. Speeds and data quantities would reach those that could be achieved by direct connection to The Cable, but without the need to wait for Maestro to be rolled out across the entire island. Currently Sure has a monoply contract with the Government of St Helena for the provision of Internet services and under this it is not clear whether it would be legal for a consumer to use OneWeb. Examination of the SURE exclusive licence suggests that, if an offence is committed by somebody using OneWeb, it is OneWeb that commits it (by providing the service), not the consumer who receives it, but this has not been tested. It is also possible that the Government of St Helena, to protect its investment in Maestro, might outright ban the use of OneWeb systems, though exactly how this might be enforced is not clear. At the time of writing it is not known if anyone is using OneWeb on St Helena, or indeed if the system is currently available here (if you know please contact us). On 22nd December 2021 Executive Council approved plans for OneWeb to establish a base station facility at Bottom Woods, which would link via The Cable. A lease was signed on 28th June 2023. OneWeb will buy capacity on The Cable, which revenue will offset some of the Cable’s operating costs. Whether this deal affects the legality of using OneWeb on St Helena is not clear. ‘Cease & Desist’ On 27th July 2023 the Government of St Helena issued a press release as follows: It has come to the attention of the St Helena Government that members of the public may have acquired, imported and be currently using terminals, such as Starlink, for the purposes of internet connectivity. Using such terminals is in contravention of the exclusivity of current telecommunications licencing arrangements made under section 3(4) of the Telecommunications Ordinance 1989. From 1 November 2023 anyone using such a terminal will be liable to be subject to a ‘ceaseand desist’ order issued on behalf of the Government. A cease and desist order is an instruction to stop using terminals, and continue to refrain from using terminals, whilst the exclusivity of the current telecommunications licencing arrangements remain in force. Any breach of such a cease and desist order may result in the confiscation of the equipment. Even assuming a Judge would give permission for premises to be entered for the purposes of confiscating equipment, exactly how the Government of St Helena proposed to prove in law that a Starlink (etc.) system was actually being used was not made clear. It was not thought likely that Starlink would open its customer records to the Government of St Helena. It was therefore widely assumed that this was simply bluster on the part of the Government of St Helena, on behalf of Sure which would have been losing revenue to Starlink. INTERNET HISTORY Dial-up Internet connection was first introduced to St Helena in 1996, but this required a call to Ascension Island and out onto the Internet from there. The first local dial-up service was introduced in 1999. Permanently-on (‘broadband’) Internet connections were launched in November 2007 with island-wide availability completed by the end of 2008. The dial-up service ended in 2010. Wi-Fi Internet was first offered in February 2008 (the first ‘hotspot’ being at Ann’s Place). INTERNET DAY 29th October is, apparently, ‘Internet Day’ where, on St Helena, we might celebrate having one of the slowest and most expensive Internet connections on the planet… 5: RADIO IN THIS SECTION: ZHH Military Radio Other Radio ZHH St Helena Radio{19} (callsign ‘ZHH’) can be found on VHF Channel 16. It is the primary communications channel for all visiting ships, including yachts. Formerly operated by Sure South Atlantic (and its predecessors) from 29th November 2018 responsibility passed to the Police. St Helena Radio keeps a continuous watch on International Distress Frequencies MF 2,182KHz and VHF Channel 16. It also monitors HF channels ITU channel 1217, ITU channel 807 and ITU channel 414, providing radio assistance to visiting ships or yachts as well as local boats. It also acknowledges, relays and assists with distress calls for St Helena, Ascension Island, or for any vessels at sea within the reception range of St Helena. MILITARY RADIO Before World War 1 Marconi was contracted by the British War Office to set up a chain of military wireless stations throughout the Empire, including one on St Helena, to communicate with naval ships, although the network was not actually completed until after the war had ended. The only station actually operating on St Helena during World War 1 was a small Morse Code station run by the Royal Marines from Ladder Hill Fort. There was much concern that other radios operating in the harbour might interfere with the RM Morse Code station, so restrictions were imposed in May 1917. These were extreme to the point of being neurotic. They required ships in harbour to unplug aerial wires from their radios and to hang the plug-ends onto the main rigging where they could be clearly seen from the shore, to ensure compliance. Additionally, physical access to the equipment was denied to the crew, the harbour master being given the authority to seal the doors of radio rooms of all ships in harbour. The RM Morse Code station was dismantled in 1920, rather than (as might have been more helpful) it being re-deployed for civilian use. 1941 photo ‘Deadwood Station’ Other radio station pages: Active stations: ⋅ SAMS Radio 1 ⋅ SAMS Radio 2 ⋅ SaintFM Community Radio Closed stations: ⋅ Radio St Helena ⋅ SaintFM ⋅ SAMS Pure Gold Related: ⋅ Amateur (‘Ham’) Radio ⋅ Diplomatic Wireless Station ⋅ Radio on St Helena R N Wireless Station, St Helena We know the Royal Navy operated a military radio station on St Helena during World War 2. Sadly we know almost nothing about it (its operations were shrouded in war-secrecy), so the following is rather sketchy, but we think reasonably accurate. The badge (left), on a Christmas Greeting from 1943, is part of the little firm evidence we can find of its existence. The station was in what is now Half Tree Hollow, along what is currently named Wireless Station Drive. It was a concrete block built structure and we do not know if it was demolished or is now one of the houses along there. It is understood from local stories circulating at the time that the St Helena station worked in conjunction with one on Ascension Island in Direction Finding - using radio to locate German ships and U-Boats operating in the South Atlantic. The principle is simple. If St Helena and Ascension both receive a signal transmitted by an enemy ship, and if both note the direction from which the signal originates, then where the lines cross on the map is the location of the vessel. The diagram (right) illustrates. For a more detailed explanation see the Wikipedia. We also think it may have had a role in coordinating naval operations in the South Atlantic, using the sub-Atlantic cable to relay messages to and from London. Finally we know they monitored the frequency 500KHz, which was by way of being an international distress frequency at the time. Watch was kept carefully because earlier the distress call sent by the SS City of Cairo had been missed on the island. Apparently although Cable & Wireless also monitored the same frequency the RN Station was in a better position and often received signals that Cable & Wireless could not. Apparently the Admiralty station in the UK (‘GZZ’) often called St Helena in the early hours of the morning, perhaps to check that the operator was awake! They were also responsible for receiving and decoding ‘Admiralty General Messages’ send to the island’s military commanders, transmitted from Rugby in the UK every day at 3am and 3pm. This function was later replaced by the Diplomatic Wireless Station. If you can provide any further information, please contact us. Note that it had the callsign ‘ZHH’ - as is employed today by St Helena Radio{19}. OTHER RADIO There was a weather radio station located on St Helena in the 1960s, on the air under the British callsign GHH. This station operated with a 1 kW Racal transmitter and an inverted V antenna system. Jamestown Meteo was in use for the teletype transmission of weather information to England on two Shortwave channels, 6824KHz and 9044KHz. The reception of station GHH was reported occasionally in Europe and in North America, and a few QSLs have been received. There is one prepared QSL card from station GHH in the Indianapolis QSL Card Collection.

Broadcast Radio is covered on our page Radio on St Helena and its associated pages and newspapers are on our page Our Newspapers. That just leaves television… A limited subscription-only television service is available on St Helena, supplied by Sure. Some households in the east of the island can also pick up television direct from a satellite serving Africa. To learn more see our page Television. In 2021 58% of St Helena households had a subscription for the Sure TV service{d}. This is expected to fall when streaming becomes available (via cable or direct satellite link). 7: COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES IN THIS SECTION: Eastern Telegraph Company Cable & Wireless Sure South Atlantic Ltd. Maestro Technologies THE EASTERN TELEGRAPH COMPANY The Eastern Telegraph Company was formed from the coalescence of four communications companies, which took place on 6th June 1872. Late in 1899 St Helena was connected to Cape Town, and shortly afterwards to London (via Ascension Island), by an undersea telegraph cable (CS Anglia laid the Cape Town to St Helena cable in November 1899 and CS Seine laid the St Helena to Ascension section in December 1899), allowing telegrams to be sent almost instantaneously to the UK and, via other connections, anywhere in the British Empire. The article below discusses this further. From The ‘Blue Book’ for 1899: The Eastern Telegraph Company have now got a station here. The line was first laid from the Cape to St Helena and connection established on November 24th last. On the 15th December of the year under report, the line was extended to Ascension, and then through communication with England, via St Vincent, was established. The charge per word is 4s{20}. It was hoped that the ability to exchange messages immediately with London might result in an increase in the number of ships calling, thus benefiting the island’s economy, but sadly this was not the case. In The ‘Blue Book’ for 1904 it was reported that only five vessels had availed themselves of this facility in the year. On 18th September 1901 the ETC purchased (from the Moss family) land in The Briars to build its base of operations. The site today remains the base of their successor, Sure.

ETC Staff Accommodation under construction (by Boer PoWs{3}) CABLE & WIRELESS ⓘ Cable & Wireless sponsored the SaintFM News broadcasts Click here to hear this audio file, or hover on the icon (right)Ⓘ Over the following years the Eastern and Western Telegraph Companies merged along with others such as The China Submarine Telegraph Company and The British-Indian Submarine Telegraph Company to form the, wonderfully named, Imperial and International Communications Ltd, which in 1934 became Cable & Wireless. The company took over the island’s telephone system in August 1989 and was responsible for various upgrades to the network including the current automated PABX (1990). They also introduced Television in 1995, the Internet in 1996 and Broadband in November 2007 with Wi-Fi Internet from February 2008. Cable & Wireless provided communications services on St Helena until their South Atlantic operations were sold to Batelco (a Bahraini Telecommunications Company) in 2013 and became Sure. (More at atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/CandW/index.htm.) Cable & Wireless Operations Centre, 1970s SURE SOUTH ATLANTIC LTD. Sure at The Briars{m} Antennas on Putty Hill Electronic communications (telephones; Internet/email; Mobile Telephones; Television) are currently provided on St Helena by Sure South Atlantic Ltd., owned by Bahraini company Batelco, under monopoly licence from the Government of St Helena. Sure has its offices in the Bishop’s Rooms in Jamestown (at the bottom of Napoleon Street), its operations base at The Briars, an antenna array on Putty Hill and various transmitter sites for Television and Radio{21} around the island. For more see the Sure South Atlantic website. Prior to 2013 services were provided by Cable & Wireless, and prior to that by the Eastern Telegraph Company{22}. Sure’s exclusive monopoly licence originally expired at the end of 2022 but due to delays in determining a replacement it was extended in 2022 to 31st December 2023 and again in July 2023 to an unnanounced date in 2024. MAESTRO TECHNOLOGIES On 9th September 2022 the Government of St Helena announced that the preferred bidder to build the island’s new data and voice networks was Maestro Technologies (Maestro). Maestro Technologies (Maestro) is a UK-based group of companies specialised in managing and investing in telecoms and IT projects. Maestro has experience in deploying fibre networks for the past fifteen years and has delivered fibre to the premises to more than 150,000 homes in UK including building a wider network at a high rate utilising new build, BT Ducts and Poles. Maestro, directly and through its subsidiaries is also deploying fibre and providing business services on Tenerife and Menorca, and in Spain and the United Kingdom. Maestro operates, through its subsidiaries, as an ISP delivering services directly to customers. Also, the Company has a software company that develops GIS, network operating systems and customer facing systems, (billing and support) and its portfolio also includes a mobile telephone service. Maestro provides the same service as St Helena requires on the Spanish Island of Menorca and there is the second largest operator there with more 5,000 homes subscribed. The full Press Release can be read hereⒾ. Maestro’s bid offered the most viable route to realising this Government’s ambitions, as set out in St Helena’s Digital Strategy and our published Strategy and Vision 2023-2025, of utilising the cable to deliver fast, affordable, reliable and accessible connectivity for the Island. With this contract, a network which SHG owns will be built across the Island.{n} Following signing of contracts on 17th November 2022, Maestro will build the network, based on both fibre-to-the-premises and 5G distribution from a Fibre backbone, and hand it over by 1st January 2024. Initially only Jamestown would have fibre-to-the-premises (because the infrastructure was already largely in place) with other areas being connected by 5G. Fibre-to-the-premises would be rolled out to the rest of the island as soon as possible, leaving the 5G network in place for the more remote premises. Live Date Delayed It was initially planned that rollout would be complete by 31st December 2023, when the Sure contract was set to expire, but in July 2023 the Government of St Helena admitted that Due to delays in finalising designs for the new network, it is now accepted that it will not be completed by January 2024 and the Sure contract was extended for an undisclosed period. 8: ISSUES All of these are directly related to using a satellite link for our telehone and Internet communications, and it is hoped that ‘The Cable’ will remove all of them. IN THIS SECTION: ‘Sun Outages’ ‘Satellite Lag’ Cost ‘SUN OUTAGES’ At the time of writing all of our Internet and telephone traffic is carried to and from the island by satellite. On St Helena the signals are sent and received by a large dish antenna, located in The Briars. Similarly our Television service comes from a satellite serving South Africa, received by a dish at Putty Hill. Because of the location of the satellites, at some times of the year (usually in September), when the Sun is at a particular point in its travel across the sky{23}, it shines directly onto the dish. This has the effect of disrupting the transmission and receipt of signals, although usually only for a few minutes. There is nothing (affordable) anyone can do about this. Notices like the one (right) appear in the local newspapers to warn of the outages. If you try to contact St Helena by telephone during these times you will get an error tone - try again ten minutes later. Websites hosted on the island may also be inaccessible{24}. TV disruptions affect few as they occur quite early in the morning. ‘SATELLITE LAG’ At present you may notice a strange phenomenon when calling St Helena from overseas (or vice versa). You speak, and then there is a delay before the other person responds. This is ‘Satellite Lag’ - it takes a while for the signal to go up to the satellite and back down to earth. There is no solution for this, but when we get The Cable it will no longer be a problem. COST As can be seen throughout the above, by developed-world standards communications to and from St Helena are slow, limited and very expensive. This disadvantages businesses that operate here, hinders education and discourages international businesses from establishing here. 9: READ MORE More stories on our page Read articles about St Helena. WARNING: You participate in any activities described herein entirely at your own risk. ARTICLE: St Helena’s part in the ‘Victorian Internet’. By J C Grimshaw, published 11th April 2011 with some additional detail from atlantic-cable.com/Cables/1899StHelena/index.htm{25}{26} At the time of the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 (Isandlwana, Rorke’s Drift et al) it took twenty days for a message to travel from Southern Africa via steamer to the Cape Verde islands and on by telegraph to London. As this remained the situation at the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899 a quicker and more direct route was urgently required. The Eastern Telegraph Company contracted the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company to manufacture and lay the necessary cables which were to link Cape Town - St Helena - Ascension Island and St Vincent in the Cape Verde Islands. Messages could then be routed over the Western Telegraph Companies’ existing cables from St Vincent via Madeira to Carcavelos, Portugal. From there to Porthcurno in Cornwall they again travelled over the Eastern network. The Cable Ship Anglia laid the 3,825Km first stage from Cape Town to St Helena, completing it by 24th November 1899, and while CS Anglia returned to the UK for more cable CS Seine laid the section from St Helena to Ascension Island, a distance of 1,560Km, completing it by 15th December 1899. CS Anglia then laid 3,660Km of cable from Ascension Island to St Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, completing the task by 21st February 1900 only four months after the start of the war. Cable warning at St Helena{2}{o} In 1901 the Eastern Telegraph Company contracted the same company to manufacture and lay another set of cables from St Vincent to Madeira, 2,090Km, and from there a 2,550 cable to Porthcurno. CS Anglia and CS Britannia carried out this work. To provide an alternative route in case of cable failure another cable laid by CS Anglia in the same year was that from Ascension to Freetown, Sierra Leone, a distance of 2,085Km. In 1902 the final link in the global network of cables owned and operated by British companies was made with the laying of the Pacific cable from Canada to Australia. The Pacific Cable, jointly owned by the British Government and the Governments of Canada, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, New Zealand, Tasmania and Western Australia in a unique partnership arrangement was, effected in obedience to the strong desire of the people of the wide-spread British Empire to utilize electricity for the accomplishment of Imperial consolidation, and to ensure that ‘The All Red Line’ touched only the territories of the British Empire. Some parts of the line had been completed considerably earlier. In 1866, the Great Eastern connected Ireland to Newfoundland, by 1870 Suez was linked to Bombay and from there to Madras, Penang and Singapore. Australia was linked to British telegraph cables directly in 1870, by extending a line from Singapore to Port Darwin and by 1872, messages could be sent direct from London to Sydney. To complete the network, the final major cable laying project was the trans-Pacific section. The route selected was Bamfield, Vancouver Island - Fanning Island - Fiji - Norfolk Island. From Norfolk Island, two cables would be laid, one to Southport, Queensland, with a landline to Sydney, while the other would land at Doubtless Bay, Auckland and in total 14,500Km of cable would be required. It was decided to lay the Bamfield-Fanning Island section in one continuous length. At the time no cable ship existed that could carry the cable to do this, so the Telegraph Construction & Maintenance Company had CS Colonia built. Laying of the 6,400Km long cable began at Bamfield on 18th September 1902, reaching Fanning Island on 6th October. Fanning Island had been formally annexed to Great Britain in 1888. The CS Anglia which had been used to connect Cape Town and St Helena then laid all the sections from Fanning Island to Australia and New Zealand during 1902. The ‘All Red Line’ was inaugurated on 31st October 1902 and the Imperial Defence Committee was able to report to the British Government, The dependence of the United Kingdom on cable stations situated upon foreign territory has been generally eliminated. Britain dominated the international cable networks and no other country possessed such an extensive network. In 1896 there were 30 cable-laying ships in the world, 24 of them owned by British companies. The Eastern Telegraph Company controlled almost 50 per cent of the world’s submarine cables while other British companies owned another 30 per cent of the cable routes. These figures underestimate the extent of British domination of worldwide telegraphic traffic because, apart from a number of transatlantic cables, most of the submarine cables owned by non-British companies were local links connecting to British long-distance routes.

For this reason it is best when using Google™ to append to your search ‘-napa -carolina -california’, which will remove many of these irrelevant results.Not any more! Since google \"enhanced\" their search to remove such operators. I just tried searching in this way for eg some restaurants and there was indeed a bunch of irrelevant results even with the exclusions. I wonder what they do now. reply warkdarrior 15 hours agoparentThe operators work for me.

The 1,140Km branch to Saint Helena was completed in 2021 so this cable will provide the first fibre optic connectivity from St Helena to the outside world through both Europe and South Africa.> Compared to the current satellite link the cable will bring almost incredible amounts of capacity. The Government of St Helena estimates that it will deliver several hundred gigabits per second - far more than the island’s population of around 4,400 people{16} could possibly use. The plan is therefore to turn the island into a communications hub> [...]> A route survey was conducted in August 2019 and at the end of the year the Government of St Helena announced that it had signed an agreement with Google™ to land the cable at St Helena, aiming to commence service in 2022.> On 6th February 2020 Sure announced that it had no plans to upgrade domestic and small-business Internet connections to Fibre-Optic when the Equiano Cable arrives in 2022, meaning ordinary users would not see the full benefits of the new system.Screw this ISP, man. reply skrause 12 hours agoparentHowever it seems that they are now building an island wide fiber network owned by the government and not by an ISP, and will end the current monopoly as soon as this network is ready: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openfalklands.com&#x2F;st-helena-plans-for-an-island-wide... reply thefz 2 hours agorootparentGood for them.

From what I understand, the Saints are an incredibly kind and chill group of people, just living life without much worry. I can&#x27;t imagine the government giving a shit reply gambiting 14 hours agoparent>>The fact there is an internet monopoly barring residents to use other internet providers is sadI guess the deal was that if this company brings internet connectivity then they get exclusivity on the island for X number of years. I wish the article would get into more details about this deal.Edit: on second read, the article does actually. It mentions the exclusivity deal was meant to expire in 2022, but because of lack of suitable replacement or alternative solutions it was extended to 2023 and it was just extended again to 2024. reply toomuchtodo 12 hours agorootparentu&#x2F;skrause mentions in another subthread that the government has commissioned a fiber optic network going live at the end of the year.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37651113https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230925221524&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indepe... (page 3) reply kickofline 18 hours agoprev> It has come to the attention of the St Helena Government that members of the public may have acquired, imported and be currently using terminals, such as Starlink, for the purposes of internet connectivity. Using such terminals is in contravention of the exclusivity of current telecommunications licencing arrangements made under section 3(4) of the Telecommunications Ordinance 1989. From 1 November 2023 anyone using such a terminal will be liable to be subject to a ‘ceaseand desist’ order issued on behalf of the Government. A cease and desist order is an instruction to stop using terminals, and continue to refrain from using terminals, whilst the exclusivity of the current telecommunications licencing arrangements remain in force. Any breach of such a cease and desist order may result in the confiscation of the equipment.Starlink seems to be illegal to protect the government’s investment in a monopoly on the main satellite. reply yencabulator 11 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s extra delicious when read in context of these quotes:> In the summer of 2016, the United Nations declared access to internet is a human right. While we are just beginning to realize the internet’s potential for our island and with the prospects of a high speed cable arriving on our shores, perhaps now is the time to re-evaluate the importance of information technology for EVERYONE. Can we truly reach our fullest potential if access to the World Wide Web is available only to those who can afford it?> Inhabitants of the tiny tropical island of St Helena pay through the nose for an internet service that mainlanders would have considered painfully slow even during the pre-Netflix era.> St Helena’s isolation and reliance on satellite technology, means that internet services are limited and expensive compared to many countries, and are a major barrier to development. The top residential package offered in St Helena provides 13.3 megabytes of data at a speed of 1.5 megabits per second, and costs £180.50 per month. reply hinkley 16 hours agoparentprevA number of years ago NYC decriminalized ownership of beehives, and a journalist interviewed a bunch of people who had them anyway. They all had schemes to hide their hives. One guy made it look like an AC condenser, and went so far as buying himself work clothes to make him look like a repairman.If you make it out of the right materials, it shouldn’t be too hard to conceal a starlink antenna without destroying the gain. reply quercusa 15 hours agorootparentThe Mystery of Red Brooklyn Honey:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.latinhoneyshop.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-mystery-of-red-... reply jimkleiber 17 hours agoparentprevI wonder if other countries will (or have) ban Starlink for censorship reasons. Or frankly, lack of censorship control.So much of our governance, if not all, is based on geographic sovereignty, and satellites can supersede that.I hope we finally get more global governance to deal with more and more global issues. reply Tijdreiziger 17 hours agorootparentI remember reading that Starlink routes traffic via base stations in the subscriber’s own country, in order not to anger regulators.If you think about it it makes sense; otherwise governments could just ban the sale of Starlink equipment for violating the law. reply pcl 16 hours agorootparentTelcos do pretty much the same -- US SIMs in China receive different Great Firewall treatment than Chinese SIMs, and I&#x27;ve seen some Chinese SIMs &#x2F; phones on some cell networks in the US get routed back through the Great Firewall. Which is IMO pretty disgusting on the part of the US telcos, but sorta functionally the same as what you say Starlink does. reply mcv 1 hour agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t have to be \"disgusting on the part of the US telcos\" to route Chinese SIMs through the Chinese Firewall if the other side of that agreement is that non-Chinese SIMs in China get to bypass that firewall.Because ultimately, that means more ways to bypass that firewall. Chinese people in the US could but a US SIM to avoid the firewall. They could even take it home.But routing Chinese SIMs through the firewall is only acceptable if the reverse is also true: letting non-Chinese SIMs in China bypass it. Otherwise it&#x27;s just more censorship. reply Scoundreller 15 hours agorootparentprevCan be seen as a positive or a negative:You can still access your home country’s Netflix&#x2F;streaming content. Log into websites that might geo-block (Homedepot.com blocks Europe…), log into work without security admins losing their mind about a “suspicious foreign access”.Downside is that ads won’t localize into a language you don’t understand. I love it when that happens when travelling. reply Tijdreiziger 11 hours agorootparentprevActually with mobile roaming, I believe the implementation is that everything just gets tunneled back to your home carrier; so I think it is not so much the case that US carriers are deliberately discriminating Chinese traffic. reply capableweb 16 hours agorootparentprevSeems unlikely that Starlink would put a base station on Saint Helena just to be able to serve some percentage of ~4000 population. Most likely the base station is somewhere else. reply Symbiote 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve no idea of the numbers, but it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;d one one somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic — either St Helena or Ascension — for traffic from aircraft and ships. reply kortilla 7 hours agorootparentprevThey don’t need a base station now with their sat to sat lasers.

The British Empire built the first global telegraph network using their island colonies, and some of these routes are still used for Internet cables. Ascension Island for example. reply fnordpiglet 17 hours agorootparentprevFrankly it would be easier to enforce at the payments layer.

This is happening with AI, where regulation is hopelessly lost in its current state. We have seen this (unsuccessfully so far) with finance and the blockchain. And arguably this is a legacy which traces its way through industrial revolution (which saw the breakup of monarchy&#x27;s monopoly on labor and land) or even the stirrup or the sword.Breaking existing rules and being unregulatable is probably an intentional point of Starlink. reply GolfPopper 17 hours agorootparent\"This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man&#x27;s laws, not God&#x27;s!

Examination of the SURE exclusive licence suggests that, if an offence is committed by somebody using Starlink, it is Starlink that commits it (by providing the service), not the consumer who receives it, but this has not been tested. It is also possible that the Government of St Helena, to protect its investment in Maestro, might outright ban the use of Starlink systems, though exactly how this might be enforced is not clear. At the time of writing it is believed that some individuals and businesses are already successfully using StarLink on St Helena{18}.It&#x27;s illegal to use the only alternative, so they can charge whatever they want. reply coryrc 15 hours agoparentprevWait until you hear about what it costs in regular parts of the US... reply aquaticsunset 15 hours agorootparentUmm... significantly less than that?

AMA reply bibstha 15 hours agoparentWhat made you choose St Helena for your travel? Did you feel like you got to see most of the island in 10 days? reply scroot 8 hours agorootparentWay back in 2006&#x2F;2007 I worked a severely boring, soul draining desk job. I cruised Wikipedia deeply and often. On one of these online excursions, I came across the article for St Helena -- by some measure the most remote inhabited island at the time -- and read more. I learned about the RMS St Helena and how it was the only regular way to get to and from the island. I knew at some point in my life I had to make the journey by sea and check it out for myself.In grad school I also became acutely obsessed with the (poorly documented) voyage of Edmond Halley to the island in order to observe a transit of Venus. I spent hours in the British Library&#x2F;Kew looking for anything that might mention what he got up to during that time (apparently the British Governor was replaced for sketchy reasons, etc etc).A decade later, I got the news that the long-awaited airport was complete and would open in 2016, and that the RMS would be decommissioned. I was in a weird position between jobs and fortunate enough to have the means to book the travel for what was supposed to be the penultimate voyage of the RMS. I had grand visions of interviewing people about what they thought of the airport opening and such (some of which I conducted and wrote about [1]).The passage I took was 5 days by sea from Cape Town to St Helena, with 10 days on the island. After that, the voyage continued north (which was unusual) to the UK, stopping at Ascension Island en route. That leg of the trip was 14 days at sea.So really, it was kind of a daydream that turned into a real dream that turned into a lived experience.

Online marketplace Sesame is partnering with the retail \"members only\" giant to offer Costco members virtual primary care for $29 in all 50 states, the New York-based startup said Monday in a blog post. The health care services listed via a link on the Costco Pharmacy's homepage include virtual checkups involving a standard lab panel and virtual follow-up with a doctor for $72, and virtual mental health visits. Sesame said it targets the uninsured and those with high deductibles who need to pay cash. It doesn't accept health insurance to help keep prices low. \"Quality, great value and low price are what the Costco brand is known for,\" David Goldhill, Sesame's co-founder and CEO, stated. \"When it comes to health care, Sesame also delivers high quality and great value — and a low price that will be appreciated by Costco Members when it comes to their own care.\" The move has Costco following other major retailers in offering health care services. Amazon provides around-the-clock remote access to third-party health care providers and Walmart Inc. runs in-store medical clinics.

Got prescribed the same antibiotics.> I had \"good\" health insurance, she had none. My bill AFTER insurance was higher than her bill without insurance.> I&#x27;m really not sure the moral but it was frustrating as heck.The moral is that any system which introduces price opacity will gradually increase the price of the product until the price is above what the market will bear.Look at it this way - at the point of purchase, you are buying a product with absolutely no price information, because \"the insurance will take care of it\". With no price information to the consumer, there is no price discovery, and without price discovery the supplier will increase prices beyond what the consumer is willing to pay.If all medical insurances were banned, the cost of medical will not exceed what the market will bear: it can&#x27;t.But that&#x27;s extreme - how about a practical and workable solution: no private dealings between medical insurance suppliers and medical service suppliers.You have medical insurance? Lovely - you will be forced to submit the claim yourself. When you visit the medical services supplier (doc, hospital, pharmacy, etc) for non-emergency services[1], you will be liable for the bill, and so you will have to lookup what that&#x2F;those particular code&#x2F;codes cost&#x2F;s.In this way the cost of medical services will actually come down, to what the market will bear.We&#x27;ve seen the same thing with US tertiary education - free money introduced into the system by the government caused tuition fees to skyrocket, with all the profit captured by the providers. IOW, the price rose to what the market will bear, and since the government was the market in this case, the price rose to what the government was able to pay, which is perhaps 3x to 10x what an unemployed 18 yo is able to pay.[1] For emergency care, obviously the claim will be submitted to you by the hospital, and you can then forward that claim to the insurance. Even better would be if all emergency procedures have state-backed insurance. reply troupo 50 minutes agorootparent> You have medical insurance?

What do you care what the \"actual cost\" of $CODE is for $MEDICALPROVIDER?> Strange how this didn&#x27;t play out in (most of) Europe.Because what the government was able to pay was a lot less than what the US government was able to pay, because the US government provided the money (with basically no controls on cost) and then made the student liable for paying it back. This way the state didn&#x27;t actually care what the purchase price was, they were always going to get it back anyway.My understanding is that in Europe (e.g. Germany), the tuition was paid for by the state! It&#x27;s not a loan, the state is not getting that money back, and so there&#x27;s pressure on the state to limit what it will pay for tuition. reply username332211 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is the consequence of the maximum profit margin provisions of the Affordable Care Act[1]. Because of it, insurance companies are now happy to pay more for the same procedures, because it actually increases their profits.In your case, they managed to negotiate such high prices that your co-pay is higher than the normal cost of the medical procedure. If you are on a Gold plan with a 20% co-pay, you can be sure that the money you paid is what went to the insurance company, while 4 times as much money went to funding healthcare!You should be really happy about this, because this is a rule created to make sure your insurance funds hospitals, not Wall Street greed![1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;wonk&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-o... reply cavisne 5 hours agorootparentprevThere is a book on this “never pay the first bill”It’s all a big scam. reply meitham 2 hours agorootparentprevThe pricing of Medicare in the uk is a bit more transparent. If you visit private health care provider they will give upfront the price for self-paying vs insurance. The insurance price is often more than double, e.g. MRI scan via insurance is around £950 vs £450 for self paying. It’s often cheaper to cover your medical bills personally than to pay a for-profit corporation and beg them to authorise every treatment when you need. reply poirot2 2 hours agorootparentSorry what? The NHS is free. There is no Medicare. Private health insurance is a luxury, it’s basically a queue jump to see the same doctors often in the same hospital as the NHS offers. Pricing is transparent because they just send you to the NHS for non profitable stuff. And if the test were necessary + urgent you’d get it free in the NHS anyway. In fact the awful incentives it creates mainly just lead to lots of unnecessary tests. That’s why insurance often won’t pay. reply meitham 40 minutes agorootparentThe NHS is indeed free, but I was not referring to treatment by the NHS. If you are adult with slipped disc, torn muscle or hernia or other no serious issues then good luck trying to be treated on the NHS. The waiting list is usually two or three years.

He knew exactly what it was the whole time.“Medical billing” is an industry probably larger than medical care.I fully support Costco here, insurance is a scam. reply kromem 5 hours agorootparentIt would have been better had the provider constraints not been struck down by the supreme court.The entire idea was using the threat of losing access to Medicare $$$ to force acceptance of all ACA plans by providers in order to drive down cost negotiations for individual payers.Large companies get to leverage large group sizes, and the idea of the ACA was to effectively turn all government aligned plans including Medicare into a single giant \"all or nothing\" group.But when the courts struck that down, instead it became the exact opposite, allowing for even more division and sub-grouping across ACA plans, which drives up the end payee costs because there&#x27;s little to no consequences for providers telling ACA plans to get bent.The ACA as designed was effectively a compromise, and then the courts reversing the key compromise meant the overall result was a hot pile of crap outside of finally ditching preexisting condition lock-in (which was still a win overall, but a much more minor one). reply valleyer 4 hours agorootparentCould you clarify which part of the ACA you are saying was struck down by the Supreme Court?The only such parts I know of are the mandatory Medicaid expansion and some stuff related to covering contraception. (And the individual mandate penalty was reduced to zero by Congress in 2017.)I was not aware of any part of the ACA that required insurers to carry certain plans, apart from the general regulations it introduced on health insurance plans in general. reply david2ndaccount 5 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps the president&#x2F;congress shouldn’t try to make unconstitutional compromises. reply afavour 5 hours agorootparentIt’s all interpretation though, isn’t it? Unsurprisingly, the Constitution has very little say on the topic of health insurance. How the content of the document gets applied to modern contexts is a matter of enormous debate, in a lot of contexts “unconstitutional” is a moving target. reply smsm42 4 hours agorootparentIt used to be the case that anything that the Constitution didn&#x27;t allow the government to do was considered not allowed. Too bad now it&#x27;s the opposite - anything the Constitution doesn&#x27;t explicitly prohibit it to do, it feels free to. And anything it does prohibit - like regulating speech - it does anyway, in a roundabout way.

Homeowners insurance, for instance: you insure against your house burning down, but you&#x27;re probably better off not making a claim for non-catastrophic events, because you&#x27;ll probably pay more than you would out of pocket, in the long run, when your rates go up.Obviously, what makes health insurance especially annoying is that there isn&#x27;t a transparent market for services the way there is for home repairs.

She then spent ten minutes asking filler questions about my medical history which had nothing to the drugs which I was requesting. Then she sends the prescription to my pharmacy. So far so good. OneMedical then bills me bloody $220 for this visit.Later on I found out that this nurse practitioner was employed by OneMedical.

Therefor the government funds the healthcare insurance companies to take care of the citizens. They do profit from other aspects so that always clashes with the non-profit side. As usual, everything in Israel is a mishmash of interests but it works for the most part. For example, they provide additional insurance (like the premiums I mentioned in the previous post) and pseudo care like acupuncture, horse riding etc... That is also subsidized if a doctor prescribe it. For example, horse riding for autisim or ADHD etc...Not to mention the they document everything digitally and I mean everything. That gave Israel the advantage to be the first to get the immunization in COVID since Israel made a deal to provide that health digital histories for the pharmaceutical companies for further research.

Also, are they any good? reply tzahifadida 5 hours agorootparentTimes are depending on priority and payments. I.e. If you don&#x27;t pay anything then you are seen in either FIFO or depending how serious it is. Your family doctor also has a say on priorities. If you pay about 15$ a month then you can have 3 appointments a year with every private doctor you want. Also, you have priorities in private surgeries. If you don&#x27;t have premium insurance and you want a private doctor then it can cost about 150$ for 1 appointment. So everyone practically pays the 15$.Plus, children up to 18 don&#x27;t have to pay the premium they automatically insured in premium. Children have full dental free care up to 18 years. No problems with appointments if you have priority (like immediate pain or something).The specialized doctors (heart brain etc...) are all encouraged to do a post doctoral for a year in Canada or US so they are pretty good. reply solatic 4 hours agorootparentprevYou can typically get an appointment with your GP within a day or two; their role is basically triage for the rest of the health system. Access to specialists is tiered; a referral from a GP gets you access to earlier appointments, without a referral you could wait for months. So people with chronic conditions who know that they need to set up appointments on a regular basis set up those appointments months ahead of time (instead of setting a personal reminder on their phones then trying to get an appointment in the next day or two), while slots are kept open for people who get referrals for more acute cases. An appointment for a specialist after securing a referral can be anywhere from same-day to a couple weeks or so. Some people pay for private insurance because the thought of waiting a couple weeks to see a specialist is unthinkable for them.I have a parent who needed cancer treatment in the US (in a major urban center), even with insurance, trying to get an appointment with oncologists, radiologists, etc. could take more than a month, trying to get surgery scheduled was a multi-month affair. Especially for cancer treatment, where time is of the essence (who knows when the tumor will continue to metastisize?), the process was frustratingly slow. The Israeli process is far faster.As far as quality... look, most doctors in the system aren&#x27;t going to be Dr. Gregory House. But no complaints. By and large, the ones I have encountered will listen, are attentive, are not immediately dismissive of attempts to self-diagnose, and do a good job.

I see the US at one extreme of saying: you are responsible for your health in all ways. In Israel it is like, we give you the option to be more healthy but we&#x27;ll catch you if you fall. There are many many progressive taxation rules. Basically if you earn a lot you pay more. It is one of the most (if not the most) heavily taxed country in the world. Mostly because of arms budgets. In Israel we view the survival of every person as important because we are relatively few. I am guessing when you have 100s of millions of people this is less important for survival as a whole. Good or bad, you decide what works for you. reply Someone1234 6 hours agoprevFor context Telehealth via my workplace, with insurance \"discount,\" costs $50 OOP.I&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll keep saying it: If the US insists on capitalist healthcare, they need to make two very specific changes to really have close to a free market system -- Insurance discounts are banned including to Medicare and Medicaid. Everyone pays the same \"cash price\" (i.e. one price) and then insurance reimburse it to the patient rather than talking with medical providers at all. You get the bill, pay cash, or get insurance reimbursement, but the price is the price. There is nothing limiting your insurance company for providing tools, advice, and technology to find the most cost-effective and beneficial healthcare. But you&#x27;re both working together on the same \"side.\" The patient is the king-maker, you decide utlimately.- Employer provided insurance is banned. Everyone, from congress through Walmart cashier buys it on an open exchange creating larger fairer pools that allows people to pick bespoke insurance based on their personal needs and finances. It also forces real competition, not for employer contracts on behalf of their employees, but for individuals and what they want&#x2F;need&#x2F;prioritize. It increases social mobility because you can leave one job and go to another without losing your insurance. Making insurance premiums tax-free is an easy problem to solve (we almost have the tools today).The US either needs to lean out of capitalist healthcare completely (e.g. socialist healthcare, like Canada or multi-EU countries) or they need to lean into it. You cannot do this silly and destructive middle ground wherein people cannot pick their services, providers, or insurance then expect the \"market\" to be rational. reply bandrami 6 hours agoparentHaving a single charge master (your first bullet point) largely removes the need for non-catastrophic insurance. The whole problem here is price discovery. As people point out, your car insurance doesn&#x27;t cover day to day maintenance (generally), but it doesn&#x27;t need to because AAMCO charges a single price for an oil change and that price is public. The reason you need insurance for normal day-to-day medicine is because you have no idea going into a doctor&#x27;s office how much anything is going to cost, and for that matter the provider doesn&#x27;t really have any idea either. reply lotsofpulp 5 hours agorootparentThe provider could choose to charge by time, but they usually benefit from insurance companies being able to pay them more than their patients, hence them choosing to accept insurance rather than charge by time or something simpler.Even planned surgery can have an upfront cost:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;surgerycenterok.com reply strken 5 hours agoparentprevReason had an article on the origins of the US system in AMA lobbying: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-doctors-broke-health-care&#x2F;I always wondered why medical insurance was so tightly integrated into the US.

So what are you waiting for? Installation is available via Homebrew. Mac and macOS are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries and regions.

Thanks for spotting the typo, fixed.WRT security implications of disabling SIP - I don&#x27;t think OS becomes any less vulnerable than usual Linux&#x2F;Windows installation. reply highwaylights 8 minutes agorootparentThis is not necessarily the case.On Linux, more or less the entire permissions system makes no assumption about SIP existing (as it doesn&#x27;t there), so other protections are relied upon to secure the system (such as SELinux, granular directory permissions, etc.).On both Linux and Windows, TPM and secure boot provide similar protections to SIP on macOS, but are optional (it&#x27;s encouraged more forcefully on Windows 11).Removing SIP from a system that relies on it as a basis for platform security is different than using a system that wasn&#x27;t relying on it in the first place. reply kafrofrite 19 minutes agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t think OS becomes any less vulnerable than usual Linux&#x2F;Windows installation.is not a good enough argument.For the story, SIP is Apple&#x27;s \"rootless\". Effectively the OS runs with less privileges than root. Disabling SIP significantly increases the attack surface.That being said, I&#x27;m grateful that someone decided to do something more native for containers in macOS. reply mbreese 1 hour agorootparentprevAnd that’s a good thing? I’m not sure the benefits of containers would be worth disabling SIP.Maybe for an automated test CI&#x2F;CD running system (which is probably the main use-case), but not on anything that users would interact with. reply ayewo 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you really want good adoption, you’ll have to figure out a way for devs to try it out without first having to disable SIP.Is this related to the code you tried to have merged here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containerd&#x2F;containerd&#x2F;pull&#x2F;8789 ? reply slonopotamus 59 minutes agorootparentNope, that PR was an attempt to upstream my changes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;macOScontainers&#x2F;containerd&#x2F;commits&#x2F;macosVanilla containerd cannot mount anything on macos.> If you really want good adoption, you’ll have to figure out a way for devs to try it out without first having to disable SIP.I can&#x27;t stress enough how I also would like it to work with SIP enabled! reply capableweb 9 minutes agorootparentprevSounds like if Apple wants developers who wants to use containers natively, they need to address the problem of not being able to offer this feature without disabling SIP.No matter what you or I think about what&#x27;s needed for adoption, technical problems get in the way of the tool working with SIP, so seems it&#x27;s in Apple&#x27;s ball court really. reply hhh 1 hour agorootparentprevDocker Desktop doesn’t require me to disable SIP. Why would I use this if it requires that? reply lloeki 1 hour agorootparentTo containerize darwin binaries?This is not an alternative to remotely connecting to a VM to control Linux containers (which DfM is) reply throwaway894345 58 minutes agorootparentprevDocker For Max marshals filesystem events over a VM host&#x2F;guest boundary which can grind the most powerful computers to a halt if you’re sharing directories between the host and guest. For example, at my last company we developed Python apps and ran them in Docker for Mac containers by mounting the source code directory into the containers (so we wouldn’t need a build step) but as our project grew the filesystem event marshaling became exponentially slower until we eschewed Docker from our dev iteration loop entirely (the fidelity benefits weren’t worth the performance hit). Note: there are lots of projects and hacks that claim to solve this problem but none made an ounce of difference. reply lloeki 48 minutes agorootparentThe alternative is to use a performant file sharing system through the VM isolation. Some people use NFS, I personally use VMware Fusion + vmhgfs.Sure it does not attempt to map fseventsinotify 1:1 but honestly I can live with that limitation given that it&#x27;s a 10x performance increase compared to the DfM kitchensink.I do go native darwin when I can &#x2F; it makes sense. reply Sharlin 33 minutes agorootparentprevDocker Desktop for macOS does full-blown hardware virtualization, which is just silly. reply solatic 2 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m more interested in this as part of a CI&#x2F;CD process for releasing macOS software.

Linux can get tedious with upgrades breaking or dependency mismatches. Homebrew is probably the largest homogenous community - if you&#x27;re doing something relatively popular there will be a lot of noise when stuff breaks.

Any tips? reply devsda 2 hours agorootparentprev> Maybe they want a unixy desktop with working sound ?In my experience, this has not been an issue for the past 10-15 years atleast. Before that there were some problems with few (external) soundcards or random cpu spikes with the mixers.However, the UX can still improve. Switching audio outputs with multiple outputs like external displays etc is not very smooth or intuitive.Some bluetooth headsets have issues but I&#x27;ve had those with a mac as well. reply rebolek 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m running Linux everyday and I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for any serious audio stuff.There is great audio software coming to Linux (Bitwig, Reaper, etc) which is great but the underlying infrastructure is a mess.There are like 3-4 audio subsystems running, I never know which one is it, setting latency is wizardry and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t run at all. It&#x27;s usually fine when I run stuff like Spotify, VLC, or Youtube in Firefox, so for user-level audio, Linux is fine IMO. But when I run something where I care about latency and multichannel output, it&#x27;s hit or miss. It runs fine one day and then I get no sound on another or distorted sound or sound playing at wrong speed and wrong pitch (yay, 44,1 vs 48).Maybe it&#x27;s the distros I&#x27;m using, maybe there are some that work better, but the UX isn&#x27;t as great as with macOS. On Manjaro, update sometimes get audio notification removed from tray and I can&#x27;t change volume using mouse or dedicated keys. Then I have to look for few hours for a solution only to have the same thing happen again three months later (same with brightness keys on laptop). On Ubuntu Studio with an external soundcard, I get randomly distorted sound or no sound at all. So it&#x27;s easier to use some shitty onboard sound, great.I like Linux, I use Linux daily, but sound on Linux is terrible. It&#x27;s much better than it was, yes, but still terrible. For anything more than \"play a song here\", macOS is much better. reply urxvtcd 1 hour agorootparentprevAnecdotal evidence, but here it goes.I moved from Linux to M1 MacBook recently. I know my greps and vims, but I was tired of audio glitches during high CPU usage, system not waking up from sleep, total OS freezes, super loud fans, and so on.Now I get none of that. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard the fans. Audio just works, everything is super snappy. It always wakes up. I&#x27;m no longer afraid of bluetooth.And on top of that, setting my $DAYJOB VPN took three minutes and it just works, where on Linux I had constant problems with DNS breaking, and setting it up was always an hour of work, praying I got the config files right this time.It really seems to be \"unixy desktop with working sound\", the best of both worlds. reply stonewhite 1 hour agorootparentExactly my experience.

[1]. Does macOS provide that? I expect not.The way Docker Desktop (and podman.io) implement \"containers on macOS\" is a bit of a cop-out: they actually run a Linux virtual machine (using Hypervisor.framework&#x2F;hvf), and have that just provide the container environment.Is that what this project is doing? But then, how could it run a macOS container?[1] based on the foundation that Linux, unlike BSDs, has a stable syscall interface! reply highwaylights 2 hours agoparentThis introduces a long-standing problem that is really the main issue I have with Docker&#x2F;Podman&#x2F;containers on anything other than Linux - you have a dedicated VM that needs memory to be set aside for it exclusively.This is fine if you have a 32&#x2F;64GB machine, but less so on an 8GB non-upgradeable laptop.I get it - memory is relatively cheap these days - and manufacturers that are building memory-limited devices are really only doing it to fleece you on obscene upgrade fees at the time of purchase - but it would be nice if there was a more elegant solution to this on Windows and macOS.WSL 1 had a solution to this that clearly took a lot of work to put together, wherein they&#x27;d have a Linux kernel running side-by-side as a Windows sub-process so that the memory pool was shared. Unfortunately it might have been too much work as they scrapped it entirely for WSL 2 and just used essentially the same VM route.If anyone knows of any projects trying to work around that problem I&#x27;d love to hear about it. If Apple really wanted to bring the development community back on board, focusing on these kind of use cases would be great, sadly it seems someone over there has taken the view that scrapping butterfly keys and the touchbar is \"enough\".Say what you will about Microsoft, but they&#x27;ve focused really hard on developer use cases for decades, and it shows. reply kdrag0n 24 minutes agorootparentThis is supposed to be possible on macOS, but it&#x27;s basically completely broken (just doesn&#x27;t work) due to a bug.

In this chain, Terminal has \"Developer Tools\" privilege, which allows you to run software, that does not meet the system&#x27;s security policy.You can disable this privilege in System settings, Privacy and Security panel. reply highwaylights 15 minutes agorootparentEDIT: Having looked at this again, I&#x27;m not sure the Developer Tools privilege is even required to run essentially arbitrary software in Terminal. Homebrew still works without Developer Tools installed, as do interpreted runtimes. If I can even run an arbitrary shell script then the privilege is pointless, which makes the case for a dedicated sandbox for Terminal even more important.This is my point, Terminal with Developer Tools privilege is essentially granting carte blanche privilege to every sub-process running there, which is not really necessary.If I could pop a Terminal with a restrictive scope, allowing read and write access only within that directory tree it would be a much better situation than we have now. macOS&#x27; permission system isn&#x27;t really that far away anyway - I can already disable Terminal&#x27;s permissions to access anything else same as other apps.Essentially a basic and very limited not-even-a-chroot would be a vast improvement and would still offer an adequate sandbox. reply slonopotamus 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, but we need to analyze picture as a whole.

Indie teams do not spend enough time making smaller (and less profitable) games first before transitioning to multi-year projects. I know it seems like the modern games-industry ecosystem is unique and there is no one who can understand our plight, but indie game studios have faced similar problems for decades and they have been able to ship creative, profitable games under those conditions. It’s critical that we learn the history of our business so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes they did. While reading John Romero’s new book Doom Guy: Life in First Person it occurred to me that at the start, he and the founders of id Software were facing many of the same issues modern indies are. It seemed so relevant that I reached out to John Romero for an interview to see what it was like releasing indie games back in the early 1990s. The following is a transcription of the interview I did with John. When appropriate, I added a bit of historical context which you can see prefaced as HISTORY. In fact, let me set the scene right now: HISTORY: In the early 1990s, John Romero worked full time at Softdisk which was a monthly subscription service where every month they would ship you a floppy disk full of PC games called Gamer’s Edge (think of it as an ancient Xbox Games Pass). While making games for Softdisk, his team innovated a technique that could make games on PC side scroll smoothly like the NES and formed id Software to release games that exploited this new technology. Their games they made under id Software were published by Apogee. When John quit Softdisk, the Softdisk CEO realized how much talent he was losing so he negotiated a deal with id Software where id Software would make 6-more games for Softdisk to be delivered in 1991. The confluence of working full time at Softdisk, then quitting and publishing games under Apogee, and then closing out on a contract for Softdisk meant that John and his team released 27 games in 1990 and 1991. For the full list of games see the table in Appendix. My meeting John Romero at GDC 2022 Chris Zukowski (CZ): Why did you make so many games in 1990 and 1991? John Romero (JR): When we were working at Gamer’s Edge, every two months we had to ship a game. That’s only six games in a year. But we also wanted to make more Commander Keen games. And we also made games outside of work. So the first half of 1991, John Carmack and I made about three games outside of the normal work hours. And then during the second half of 1991, all of our hours, once again, were spent on two games at a time. It resulted in 13 games that we made in 1991 alone. From July of 1991, it took us three months to do the first Commander Keen 4 episode that was shareware. We felt like that was kind of a disaster. Like it took too long, it’s a game that everybody remembers from the Keen series, but to us it was like that was a bad, bad, bad, that it took three months, that’s nuts! We knew we had to go faster if we’re going to ship by Christmas. So what we did was make Keen 5 right after 4, but then we got a deal to make a Keen for Christmas. And it had to be done before Christmas, way before Christmas, to get in boxes and in stores. So we had to do Keen 4 and then Keen 6 and then Keen 5. For Keen 5 to even make it for shareware to make it out into the market. At the same time we’re trying to ship these games, we were making the first texture map 3d shooter game. Called Catacomb 3D. And that took two months as well to get that done. It was so busy. CZ: How did you manage to do it that fast? JR: There were just four of us. We’d been making games every day for 10 years. So we had so much experience making games, especially small games. We knew how to scope. We knew what felt like a good size, so when we scoped it out, it was 16 levels made with a level editor, which I already had made. CZ: How did you scope it? (Screenshot of the Gamer’s Edge platformer Shadow Knights) JR: The scoping on our very first game, Slordax: The Unknown Enemy, was really us deciding how many levels we can make and how long it take us to make these levels. At the time, we didn’t know how long it take Adrian to do varieties of textures, tiles (with scrolling), characters, the ship, shooting, sound effects. You’ve got to create levels, you’ve got to write an editor for that. We saw how many levels we could make, and that kind of showed us what our velocity was. The second game was a totally different game. It was a side scrolling ninja game called Shadow Knights. We could see how many levels we could make before we hit our two month goal. And so we could tell that we’re getting faster. The art was going at a good speed so we could determine how much data we can create for these games. The same time that we’re doing that, we’re actually scoping out Commander Keen and we scoped out 48 levels to get done in these three months that we were trying to fit in. CZ: How were you disciplined to keep your ideas small enough to produce so fastt? Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World. John had worked on this project with a larger team JR: I had made big games before, and it was really fun making big games [Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World and Journey: The Quest Begins]. But they were too big for one person to make. So as a team, we knew not to scope beyond the time that we knew that we had. We knew that we were under constraints and that those constraints are finite. So we didn’t whine or complain that we weren’t making big games because we said let’s just get done with our current games and then we’ll think about what’s next. So when we got to the point where we were done with obligations to Softdisk Publishing and we can actually just be 100 percent id Software. CZ: Weren’t all games small at that time? Screenshot of Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny. A huge game at the time. JR: Back in the 80s, there were massive games. So if you talk about, say, Ultima V, you’re looking at several years of a team of people, maybe 10 people working on it. Programming in an assembly language, making a lot of data as compressed as possible to fit on probably 10 disk sides. These projects were really big. I think they had a producer on board to handle all the tasks. And this is in the 80s. So when we started making our games, especially with Keen, it was September. You have to ship for Christmas and we had to ship three games. We knew, “Okay, these are going to be fast, these won’t be really huge games, but we’ll do the best that we can.” We mapped out an initial 16 levels per game. So that’s like 48 levels. So we decided, we can do 48 levels and two and a half months plus all the code and all the art and animations. CZ: There were a lot of Keen sequels in a short period of time. Were you worried they would cannibalize each other? JR: No, because people just wanted more, more and more and more. History Lesson: In 1991, John Carmack began research on a 3D-real-time game engine that was the predecessor of every First Person Shooter (FPS) we have today. Carmack was doing things that had never before thought possible with a consumer-grade home computer. It was revolutionary. But, instead of just holding the tech until it was perfect, id Software published 2 smaller, more experimental games under their contract with Softdisk. Those prototype games were Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3D. You can actually play these foundational FPS games in your browser by clicking the following links Play Hovertank 3D Play Catacombs 3D If you love FPS games, are making one, or just interested in games history, it is required that you try out the games just so you understand how industry-redefining games actually involve many many evolutionary baby steps that are largely forgotten. Know your gaming history. CZ: You all released the first smooth scrolling 3D game with the game Hovertank, but you published it under Gamer’s Edge, not under your studio id Software. Why reveal your hand with such revolutionary technology? Screenshot of Catacombs 3D, an early version of id Software’s revolutionary 3D engine. The first prototypes were actually shipped as Gamer’s Edge games. JR: We were basically getting paid to experiment and do R&D (Research and Development) and create a 3D engine. We made it and sold it to them. And then later we could take another chance six months later with Catacomb 3D doing texture mapping for the first time. And so it was another experiment that they’re paying us for. And then with Wolfenstein 3D, we were on our own at that point. We had done 3D twice, we knew how to do it, and we’re going to do our own game this time. We didn’t need advances or anything like that kind of stuff. We already had money coming in every month (from the Keen series). CZ: When did you know you were ready to move from Keen games to make Wolfenstein and Doom? Castle Wolfenstein 3D was the first game that id Software released after completing the Gamer’s Edge contract for 6 games. There was no time constraint in making it, so they got it out in a very long 5.5 months. JR: I knew that we’re wasting our time with Keen because 3D was really where it’s going to be. It’s not going to be with this 2D stuff. We need to get out of the 2D stuff. We’d spent two weeks already making a really cool demo of Keen 7. It had VGA parallax scrolling, all this stuff that was going to be a big jump in 2D. And… at one in the morning, I said “Guys, we should not be doing this game. We have this cool technology that we’re not using, that we’re not taking advantage of to make a better version of that game going forward.” And so everyone immediately went, ‘Yep, you’re right.’ That’s where Castle Wolfenstein was kind of born, was right then. We knew this is the first game that we’re going to make that does not have a time constraint on it. And, uh, and so this is, this is let’s make a really good game and put everything that we feel belongs in it and just do it right. And that’s what we did. And it took us four months to get the shareware version out, which for us four months is crazy. We spent a month and a half getting the five episodes of maps and bosses done. And so it was a total of five and a half months with the hint book and like everything. So it felt like that was great. We weren’t time-constrained. We could make a really great game and we did and really liked it. CZ: In the early days of id Software, you guys were making decent money but not Ferrari money yet. Were you upset by that? Did you know how much money the big studios were making in the 1990s? JR: When I was working at Origin Systems, they would have a company meeting and they would talk about sales and everything. And they were making amazing money, like $3,000,000 profit in 1987 (side note that is $7,605,928.98 in 2023 money.) We wanted to be LucasArts and Origin in quality but make the kind of games at the size that we felt was appropriate. We don’t want to make these epic sagas. We just wanted to make really fun experiences. CZ: But At the time, Softdisk paid you just $5000 ($11,405 in 2023 dollars) for every game you developed for them. Did that seem small compared to what you saw Origin was earning? Softdisk, publisher of Gamer’s Edge: What Software company offices looked like in the late 80s. Courtesy of John’s Photo Archive JR: No, we were blown away that it was that much. Back then rent was really cheap. It was in the hundreds of dollars per month. Our goal was to survive as a company and a team. So when we got the first check and the idea was to start the company, work full time, and there was four of us. The first thing that we thought was “we need to hold on to as much money as we can in the company.” Each person at that point had a different situation with how much money they needed to spend to live every month because of their rent cost and their bills that they had. There might be a car payment or something. Later, we were making $50,000 a month and, and we gave ourselves little raises, but we kept as much as we could in the bank because if, if the game didn’t sell well or we had a dry spell or took too long to make a game or whatever, we needed to be able to keep on going to finish the game and to be able to get it out. So we had to be as conservative as we could possibly be. Yeah. We weren’t out buying anything. We were just working. CZ: Today your first month of sales are a large proportion of how much your game will make. What was the revenue curve like for newly launched games in the 1990s? JR: It was a very long tail. The spike wasn’t even at the beginning because BBSs (Bulletin board systems) were really limited in the amount of people that would be exposed to stuff. So, our initial spike actually went on for a long time. At minimum, it was half a year before it peaked, and then it went down. Income stacking was critical. We needed to be getting income from multiple games at the same time. We made $10,500 ($23,846 in 2023 dollars) that first month of id Software. By the same time the next year, we were making $50,000 ($113,555.35) per month. And it’s because of income stacking. At that point, we had the original Keen (which was still going really strong), we had the second set of Keens, and what that meant was we had a shareware version of Keen that had two pieces, which was a really bad idea, because it didn’t do as well as the first one because of that. But we also had a retail Keen that was out as well, so we had three products that were out and we also had money coming in because we’re making these Gamer’s Edge games. So we were just being real conservative and saving as much as we could. And then when Wolfenstein 3D hit, that changed the world basically. It was huge. CZ: How did you make money even after Wolfenstein and Doom hit it big? Workstation of Wolfenstein 3D development From John’s photo archive JR: After Doom (during Quake’s development) was when I got Final Doom going. But I also had Heretic and Hexen. We did Master Levels for Doom 2. We were upgrading Doom to Ultimate Doom to go retail. It was just a lot of games. I think within the six years that I was there at id Software, we had published 35 Games or something like that. CZ: If we were to transport 20-year-old John Romero to 2023, with today’s tools, and game environment, do you think you could replicate that productivity of the 1990s? JR: I think so. When you look at the breadth of indie games and what they look like, if you go to itch. io and places where indies live, there’s such a wide range of art styles and games. Horror games are massive with indies and there’s a 1995, a PlayStation aesthetic of graphics. That’s really big. It takes less time to make that graphic quality than it does for a realistic or semi realistic full Unreal Engine. So, you could do that if you were spending the most time that you can on the gameplay part because the engine’s done. Don’t think about the engine, you think about making. Figure out what you’re making, your experience. Let’s say if it’s Unreal, are you making blueprints that are really modular for the different rooms you’re going to go in if you’re making a horror game. You want it to feel like it’s a roller coaster ride to get through. So how are you pacing it? How big is it? What’s the scope? I do game jams every once in a while. In 2017 I did a 10 hour game jam with a programmer that works at our company. In 10 hours we put together a horror adventure game, with about 13 different screens, creepy music, creepy dialogue, and it had a very weird vibe and published it. If you want to check it out, it’s called July 4th, 1976. So it’s on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows done in, in 10 hours published on four platforms. There’s a really great company in Portugal that’s putting this game together with a bunch of other indie games and they’re going to be taking the Switch version of it and it’s going to actually appear on an indie compilation on Switch. But you can see, it’s a 10 hour game. If you’re asking, what games can you get in a month, this is 10 hours. To see more of John Romero’s side projects, check out his site Play Barf CZ: But what if my dream game is in the style of a Final Fantasy game? JR: You need to scope way down. A scoping exercise is like the most important thing you can do at the very beginning. Like, just think about this: since we’re talking about the horror genre and I did this 10 hour thing, one of the most memorable horror demos that people have seen in recent years? It’s P. T. It’s a hallway, and people won’t forget it, right? It’s a hallway. And that tells you everything about the amount of content you need to make to stick in people’s minds. It’s the design that matters. It’s not the size. It’s not a gigantic adventure. It’s doing something brand new no one has seen in the genre that you’ve chosen that’s really unique. And if you’re talking about spending a lot of time on a game, spend it on design. Think about what you’re doing and think about something that’s new and pushing the boundaries of the genre that you’re in. CZ: What if you are stuck in a 2,3, or even 4-year-long development hell? JR: If you don’t see the end, if you don’t see a good end, if you don’t know where it’s going to end up, but you have an idea for something else that you’re more excited about, it’s really hard advice, but I would like do the thing that you’re most interested in doing, even if you’ve spent that much time. It’s going to show that it’s not this big inspired amazing thing because you wouldn’t be in that position if it was. So move on to the next thing as soon as you can. You’ve learned a lot. You’ve learned what happens when you have big ideas and they don’t turn out to be what you were hoping for. Try to make something maybe more doable in a shorter span of time. Even if it’s mildly successful, you’ve learned something. Do another thing that’s a little bit bigger. And it could be a sequel. It could be an offshoot. If it’s the kind of game that you like, but start small always and release something that’s interesting and then go up from there. Don’t ever start with something gigantic if you haven’t done it before, because you don’t know what’s going to happen if you’ve never done it before. The bigger it is, the more off course you’re going to get. Just think about an angle where you’re trying to hit a mark years down the road. If it’s off by one degree, what’s it going to look like years later? Those errors will magnify over time. So you need to make sure that you make really good decisions at the very beginning and try to correct them as soon as you can. As soon as you see something’s wrong, cut your losses as soon as you can. You have a certain amount of time. You only have so many games. CZ: Final question, what do you think about the term Boomer Shooter? The funny thing about boomers, it doesn’t even matter because for people who made up the term boomer shooter, anyone who’s old as a boomer, boomers are actually the kids of World War Two vets. That’s my mom. My mom is 20 years older than I am. She’s actually a boomer. So, boomers are not typically developing games. It’s funny. It’s a funny name. And I usually say it is a boomer shooter. It’s got a shotgun in it. It makes a big boom sound and you’re shooting. it doesn’t bug me. It’s really like you’re trying to nail the aesthetics of the style and that’s like that’s a phrase that kind of says what you need to know Additional reading and watching Watch John Romero’s talk about the making of Wolfenstein Watch John Romero’s GDC talk about the making of Doom Buy John’s Book.

Doom was released 30 years ago. In a much, much smaller market and in a lot less competition. He is saying people are not making smaller games before moving to bigger projects but people, collectively, are doing that. For every \"13 games that we made in 1991 alone\" back then, now there are probably 130 games that gets released everyday. Not one of them will probably make any real money let alone be popular.It is a bigger market. Sure you are increasing your chances if you release more, if you get better but still it is mostly about luck at this point for indie devs. Even with the name John Romero and some big publishers behind he is not able to replicate his success today reply kanwisher 13 minutes agoparentCheck out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itch.io&#x2F; there is whole communities of people that are constantly making small games. Better to get your feet wet then to jump into a giant game reply gabereiser 12 hours agoprevI still prefer smaller games or games by smaller dev teams. Don’t get me wrong, AAA titles are fun but it’s like going to the movies, it’s predictable - it’s consistent - and it’s mindless.My biggest gripe is that these smaller, “starter” games usually don’t get much play. Everyone wants to immerse in a loading screen space sim but can’t stand well-painted pixel sprites? Crazy.There’s still hope. Hit games are hits not because of just their art but because of their play. Fez, for example, had pretty mediocre art. What it did have is an awesome 2.5D world. Doom, at the time, had great art. It hasn’t aged well. However, the level design, textures, and concepts, and play are still fantastic.My only advice is if you want to make games, start making games. Who cares what your avatar looks like. Make it fun. @ works just fine.Also, Commander Keen art splashes were top notch. The only thing missing was pro dithering. reply mjr00 10 hours agoparent> Doom, at the time, had great art. It hasn’t aged well.It&#x27;s in the eye of the beholder, but I strongly disagree with this. The art is absolutely timeless; cacodemons, cyberdemons, the super shotgun and the BFG9000 are some of the most recognizable video game designs of all time. Most importantly, the art direction feels very consistent and cohesive. You can contrast it to something like Heretic, which came out at the same time and runs on the same engine, yet looks noticeably worse.I wouldn&#x27;t play it at 320x200 on a modern PC, but take your pick of source port to run at 1080p+, and Doom still looks great. reply corysama 10 hours agorootparentIf you are looking for an upgrade to make playing Doom today look like it did in your memory, there&#x27;s https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moddb.com&#x2F;mods&#x2F;doom-voxel-projectReview by Digital Foundry https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=M-aVt77epQ4 reply usefulcat 6 hours agorootparentThat actually looks great.

It&#x27;s amazing and just so much fun. Play today. You can lower the graphics to look like Doom or adjust them to look like fairly decent, but obviously retro inspired. It&#x27;s set in the Warhammer universe.Regarding the datedness of games like Doom & Duke Nukem 3D, I&#x27;ve noticed a peculiar principle where they start off looking horribly dated to me, but my brain quickly adapts and I don&#x27;t even notice the drop in realism after a few hours. It just becomes fun. reply mjr00 7 hours agorootparentBoltgun&#x27;s alright. My favorite of the neo-retro shooters is Amid Evil. (Weird to call a game with RTX raytracing support retro, but that&#x27;s 2023 for you.)But honestly, IMO, if you want to play Doom or Quake... I recommend just playing Doom or Quake. The modding scene for both games has been active for nearly 30 years, and there&#x27;s still excellent content coming out for both games regularly. If anything, modding popularity has accelerated in recent years thanks to \"Doomtubers\" like decino giving additional exposure to custom maps. Dwell[0] came out this year and is one of the best Quake map sets&#x2F;mods ever, and the Cacowards[1] always has great stuff, with the 2023 edition coming soon.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quaddicted.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;dwellv2p2.html[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doomworld.com&#x2F;cacowards&#x2F;2022&#x2F; reply swivelmaster 6 hours agorootparentAmid Evil is awesome but I enjoyed DUSK (also published by New Blood) a bit more! reply taneq 9 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;ve come full circle on low-rez graphics, at the time it was the best definition they could generate but now it&#x27;s an aesthetic.The original Doom graphics work surprisingly well in VR, too.

I find it has aged just fine, aesthetics wise.Or do you mean the lower res of the original? reply acomjean 6 hours agoparentprevI played doom recently on Linux. I have almost all the original wads from Doom box set. One thing that struck me is how fast you can move in that game. But the not being able to look up can make it a little wierd.I like simplier story games sometimes. The uncharted series I thought was fun, you get 2 weapons and maybe some grenades. Lots of cut scenes.Compared to some of the inventory and level up trees I have seen it was refreshing. Watching my partner play fallout 4 I was amazed at the inventory management required.On iOS when I need a quick game, I’ll play plasma sky which is a modern galaxan style shooter. reply keyle 1 hour agorootparentyeah that&#x27;s why many modern FPS are considered walking simulators.Back in the day, e.g. quake 3 arena, flying, jumping, always running was exhilarating.Nowadays... cut scene, NPC hand holding, fake action to tutor... I get it, they lose less people from research groups, at the cost of the real gamers that know the basics.Also the art team literally spent a month on a room that you can just jump through? What a waste, no, the player has to be stuck here for a solid minute, walking slowly, bobbing the camera side to side etc.I&#x27;m convinced that to have games that people fly through quickly, you need either procedurally generated content or PS1 and older type graphics. With realistic graphics, it&#x27;s impossible, unless it&#x27;s a closed-room situation. reply FirmwareBurner 3 hours agorootparentprev>But the not being able to look up can make it a little wierd.Install GZDoom over it.

More abstract, also short, no pressure: Proteus. reply Baeocystin 10 hours agorootparentprevI recently came across Shadow Complex, which is a 2.5D Metroidvania type experience. It was fun, scratched the right gaming itch, and was the right size, if that makes sense. It didn&#x27;t try to be anything it wasn&#x27;t, but it did what it was well. Worth checking out if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet. reply adamrezich 9 hours agorootparentShadow Complex is a classic at this point—I played through it at release while sick in bed with H1N1 in 2009. it&#x27;s like the perfect medium-sized game—it goes above and beyond to do cool stuff, without ever overstaying its welcome in any regard. just enough neat cool things you haven&#x27;t seen before—like pushing the right stick up contextually aiming your gun into the Z-plane to shoot guys in the background. I wish people set out to make more medium-sized games like that, though I&#x27;m sure the budget was much higher than we think it is. reply NikolaNovak 9 hours agorootparentprevYou should play a short hike, especially if you have a steam deck.Other great or lovely short games :FirewatchSteamworld dig 2 isn&#x27;t as short but you can play it in 10 min chunks and it&#x27;s cheerful and funBackbone (now called tails noir I think) is weird but worthwhile.

It&#x27;s basically a modernization of the Doom&#x2F;Quake formula, but with satisfying pseudo-retro graphics and really thoughtful level design. It&#x27;s also made by two people (I think three technically, but the site lists two) who have worked on AAA titles like Doom 2016, the new Wolfenstein, and Bioshock: InfiniteProdeus also has a shotgun that can snipe enemies at far distances with a long range incendiary modehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prodeusgame.com&#x2F; reply dale_glass 10 hours agorootparentI kinda wish the \"retro graphics\" could be turned off at least in 3D games.I don&#x27;t really get the appeal to start with. DOOM wasn&#x27;t retro, it had amazing graphics and required good hardware to run acceptably. Monkey Island wasn&#x27;t \"pixel art\", it was state of the art on the hardware of the time.Many games of the era had high resolution modes, and got them as soon as it was remotely practical. Duke Nukem 3D could be played at 800x600. reply Minor49er 10 hours agorootparentIn the case of Prodeus, the devs aimed to solve the problem of sprites, but in a true 3D space. With a lot of Doom ports, when mouselook was enabled, it showed just how flat everything actually was since looking up and down in true 3D would make them look like cardboard. But with Prodeus, everything is 3D but models render as if they were sprites at fixed angles. I really like this aesthetic and haven&#x27;t seen any other games do something quite like it. I stopped consciously noticing it partway through the campaign reply bernawil 3 hours agorootparentI love fixed angle sprites in 3d environments like the original Total War games. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spicyburn.weebly.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;1&#x2F;2&#x2F;6&#x2F;7&#x2F;126751672&#x2F;35724...One of my favorite aesthetics next to isometric RTS with smooth animations like the old Stronghold games. reply dale_glass 23 minutes agorootparentThat looks like the same engine Warhammer: Dark Omen used. I played that quite a lot.But I guess I never developed the nostalgia for the technical limitations of the time. Even back in those days I clearly saw them as a limitation to be tolerated. The sprites meant that I couldn&#x27;t correctly perceive the rotation of the units, since there were so few angles available. This meant sometimes I couldn&#x27;t tell if the game was buggy and my units were looking the wrong way, or the sprite system just wasn&#x27;t able to display their true state. The sprites were a means to the end of rendering units with more detail than 3D tech of the time allowed, not something that in itself was appealing.I think what would be more interesting is not to imitate the exact state of technology in the 90s, but try leaning into the same approach with modern tech. Render the hell out of those sprites at ultra high res and levels of detail, and try to make a sprite game that uses sprites because even a GTX 4090 couldn&#x27;t render that in real time.Though at this point in time it might already be too late for this to make sense, since the amount of detail a modern video card can produce is insane. reply BXlnt2EachOther 8 hours agorootparentprevProdeus also seems to have an option to use those 3D models rather than the derived&#x2F;simulated sprites. Saw it in an article a while back and thought it sounded cool... might have even stumbled on the article here at hckrnews?A&#x2F;B video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Vb-hPYOIwMw (warning, digital blood)Looks like it is on XBox&#x2F;PC Gamepass for those who have an active subscription, but it is cycling out at the end of the month. reply RileyJames 10 hours agorootparentprevDoes it have anything in the way of multiplayer?Never loved doom, but quake 1&#x2F;2 consumed a lot of hours in multiplayer.Always keen to see modern twists on the original, fast paced, movement focused, fps style.I like the prodeus aesthetic, but I’m not sure it’s that style. But I’ll buy and see. Thanks for the tip.P.s if you visited their site and couldn’t find the game, it’s on steam.

Pixel art (like so many graphic adventure games) might not be your thing but different styles for different folks.I know you were trying to say \"it didn&#x27;t offer graphic card pushing 3d like AAA games but it did X uniquely\" but by no means can you call that mediocre, specially if you&#x27;ve ever seen old games.Gameplay over one specific style of graphics, is probably the concept you&#x27;re looking for. reply gabereiser 6 hours agorootparentI mean mediocre. There was nothing special about it. It wasn’t even that good. There have been much better looking pixel art games made. The style of Fez came from Phil redoing the art 3 times, outsourcing the character design, and still managed to release it.And never seen old games? I grew up on Atari. I’ve been playing games since. Even made a few. Fez was amazing but not for its art. It was flat. I still enjoyed it. I think gamers shouldn’t get so hung up on pushing their systems to the limits and instead should focus on pushing their play to the limit. reply brezelgoring 12 hours agoparentprev>Fez, for example, had pretty mediocre art.Are you in the camp that says the creator was an insufferable man that did a lot of damage to the credibility and likeability of indie developers for years to come?I remember reading about that a while ago and it wasn&#x27;t until the last 5 or so years that indies got back into magazine covers and such. reply giobox 11 hours agorootparent> Are you in the camp that says the creator was an insufferable man that did a lot of damage to the credibility and likeability of indie developers for years to come?I can&#x27;t agree with this assessment at all - the idea Phil Fish, \"insufferable\" or otherwise, somehow caused a lot of damage to \"the credibility and likeability of indie developers for years to come\" seems a bit absurd to me. reply gabereiser 9 hours agorootparentprevNot at all. I think Indie Game The Movie took a lot of liberties to show him a certain way. I think the stress of it all got to him and now he does other things. I’m more aquatinted with the programmer Renaud from back in the days. I think the media loves a juicy meltdown story and tried to make him a scapegoat for the indie game industry going mainstream.Indie games not on magazines says more about the indie games at the time, nothing more. How many times you going to feature Jonathan Blow?Was Phil Fish insufferable? I don’t know, never met him. Did he say some things that were not in alignment with my worldview? Yeah, sure.I do think Fez, the game, the wonderful spectacularly clever game, was the indie equivalent of a Mario brothers hit.The void I think you speak of was when XNA died, MonoGame wasn’t quite there yet, people jumped to Unity and it took them awhile to get up to speed in it. Others like me went off and wrote their own engines and stuff, others joined the ranks of the studios.I think Phil made the best game he could. That’s all that matters. Everything else is superfluous. reply fbdab103 10 hours agorootparentprevArtist is weird (and probably a real jerk).

Because there are a lot of things that he conveniently did not discuss in the book but which fans know happened! So what kind of super-power reply whatever_dude 8 hours agoparentThis has been mentioned extensively before, and corroborated by other people. I think it&#x27;s true. He had an old podcast he&#x27;d ask old time Apple II&#x2F;PC developers about stuff they developed, and they&#x27;d be struggling to remember stuff that Romero knew every detail of. It&#x27;s remarkable, and even a bit frustrating to listen.Also, about some stuff not mentioned in the book... I do think it gets light in details the further it goes, but you also need to read the disclaimer: there are people who asked not to be covered in the book and he respected that. There&#x27;s one particular storyline that is never mentioned at all... to me it&#x27;s very clear the person involved likely asked not to be mentioned because they&#x27;ve moved on.When one&#x27;s writing from the first person, about friends and acquaintances, they have to be more polite than someone who&#x27;s acting like a neutral observer, like in \"Masters of Doom\". reply test1235 3 hours agorootparent>There&#x27;s one particular storyline that is never mentioned at all... to me it&#x27;s very clear the person involved likely asked not to be mentioned because they&#x27;ve moved on.who&#x27;s that then, and what&#x27;s the storyline? reply MegaDeKay 10 hours agoparentprevI just finished Doom Guy a few days ago and really enjoyed it. The start of the book is definitely not what I (or probably anybody else) expected but it was a hell of a story. I also appreciated his honest conclusion near the end where he comes to the conclusion for his post-Id failures.I did think he should have gone into more of a deep dive into why Daikatana was a bad game. Yeah, turnover. Yeah, delays from chasing the new shiny engine. But for a company he started where \"Design Is Law\", why did his game suck when Deus Ex being developed at the same time at the same company turn out so great? And how was id able to pump out Quake II and Quake III in the time he was buggering on Daikatana?Somewhere in the book (start or end, can&#x27;t remember) there is a quote from Carmack that references Romero&#x27;s amazing recall ability, so I&#x27;ll give hime the benefit of the doubt here. reply zach 9 hours agorootparentIf you’re interested, I worked for a short time on Daikanana and have some thoughts on this topic, some of which match up to themes in John’s book: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cracked.com&#x2F;personal-experiences-1596-5-things-w...To make this more HN-relevant, I will say that the whole point of Ion Storm was supposed to be unleashing Romero’s game direction, but the business partners who were supposed to give him that space instead provided another level of distraction.John worked insanely hard and doesn’t blame others for what he’s responsible for, but with all the business chaos at Ion which he dealt with personally, he just could not be on top of everything and that’s the major reason why DK was not the epic game it could have been. That’s the part that he doesn’t want to say, but to me it’s clear.It’s a good example of why a startup needs its product visionary highly focused at the most critical times. As a rough approximation, every night John went to bed thinking about Ion’s latest issues instead of thinking about Daikatana was a lost chance to make the game 2% better. That adds up. reply lloeki 3 hours agorootparentFor what it&#x27;s worth I have fond memories of Daikatana.Sure it was buggy as hell (at lest the build I had and how it behaved on my specific machine) and had a ton of flaws, and I could not complete the game due to a particular bug, but I could not help but feel something happening deep down inside this game. Frustratingly I can&#x27;t exactly put my finger on it, but if I tried it&#x27;d be like I was reading between the lines^Wissues and in a way experienced that instead of the thing you directly interacted with.And that wasn&#x27;t because of the hype as it was handed over to me among a pile of other discs before I even heard of it (which is what happens when you live in some random remote area). reply MegaDeKay 8 hours agorootparentprevCool to hear from someone that lived it, if just for a short time!I read the article and it certainly touches on the high points, but to John&#x27;s credit, he goes into much deeper detail in the book. Eight people left because of high level infighting, but John knew of the problem and didn&#x27;t do anything about it until it was too late. John was for buying the Anachronox crew thinking it was an easy way to knock off one of their game commitments to Eidos. Turned out it wasn&#x27;t so easy. Eidos was all in on the fancy office tower and happy to pay because it would be their corporate HQ as well.I was a bit surprised that the article said Dallas was a difficult place to staff. My impression from the book was that good people were so keen to work with a big name game developer that they&#x27;d go anywhere to do so. My memory from the book was that John got pretty much anyone he made an offer to. reply zach 3 hours agorootparentI was not as aware of all the drama that happened before I got there (August 1999) except for reading Stormy Weather* and hearing the weird twice-daily all-office pages for Todd Porter that made me wonder if he was holed up somewhere.From what I learned about it since that time, the details John shares in the book are definitely much more significant factors in why things happened why they did. And if anyone needed to learn what the words “vertical slice” meant, it was the DK production team. Programming the sidekicks, a definitional feature, was left until close to the end of the project, with disappointing results.So the complaints about how hard staffing was and how people didn’t want to come to Dallas were straight from John’s mouth, but I think it had a lot to do with the state of the project and Ion. Steve Ash (RIP), our fourth lead programmer, was just about ready to return to California where he would end up helping to start Double Fine, so that situation was on his mind (speaking to me as a California fly-in AI programmer).But as the 1300x960 arrow story typified, experienced developers were hard to find as team sizes were doubling from 20 to 40 throughout the industry. At the same time, Daikatana was being roasted constantly on Old Man Murray, Something Awful and various messageboards, and Half-Life made Daikatana’s story and cinematic ambitions seem less impressive. So by 1999, it’s fair to say Ion Storm was a hard sell as a place to work for a lot more reasons than the Dallas area...* - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dallasobserver.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;stormy-weather-6427649 reply nfRfqX5n 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not quite finished with it but I thought Masters of Doom had more drama.

I really enjoyed the first part of the book, where he describes how he encountered the tools of the \"stone age\" of computing and learned to build games on his own. He starts from fairly nothing and gets to the point where his games are regularly the feature game in the computer games magazines of the time. All of this is juxtaposed against and with the constant background of his frequently gasoline fume volatile home life.I found the second part of the book which begins after Doom is launched and Doom II goes into development to be more of a slog to get through. He also goes at length into his post-Id Games games and how he made some mistakes and some successes. For example. Deus Ex came out of his game company because he gave Warren Spector the independence to build it and many influential personalities in the game industry nowadays got their start at his game company.My recommendation? Read the first part of the book if you want to get a real FPV of the Wild West in which pioneers like Id Games built the first complex, performant 2D and 3D games and game engines in a world where performance was mostly determined by assembly language wizardry and mastery, not a GPU.I don&#x27;t doubt that John Romero has that superpower ability. reply Subdivide8452 1 hour agoparentprevI loved the part where he was still with id; how he grew up, and how id came to be. The magic of that founding id games makes you wish you were a part of that group. After that, the Ion Storm stuff gives some context to the failure, which was interesting to read. But it becomes a bit more incoherent. Towards the end, post Ion Storm, it just feels like he&#x27;s going through notes he wrote down, and you&#x27;re reading them in a chronological order. All in all one of my favorite books, but the end was a bit of a drag. reply hnthrowaway0315 10 hours agoparentprevI like how his childhood gets covered extensively.

Shame: Romero is an interesting man and this was an interesting time in the industry. reply hresvelgr 8 hours agoprevThe biggest thing that kills indie developers is taking a waterfall approach to game design. \"I want to make an XYZ genre game with mechanic ABC and a story about 123.\" There is absolutely no way to know if that combination of designs will be fun at all, and it won&#x27;t be until they&#x27;re too far in development before they realise it&#x27;s irredeemable.Best advice I ever got on this subject: identify what you want the most impactful element of the game to be. Is it a unique combat mechanic? Is it a compelling story? Make that first and only that. If it&#x27;s impactful, take it further and build more around it. Show it to people as early and regularly as possible. If people tell you it&#x27;s boring, they&#x27;re probably right, but don&#x27;t listen to them if they tell you how to fix it. If you can&#x27;t fix it, toss it and move on. You cannot afford to find out if your game is fun 2 years into development. Also, most of your ideas are probably terrible and you won&#x27;t start having better ideas until you make and finish a number of projects. reply aikinai 7 hours agoparentThis is the secret to Nintendo’s success. Despite being a very traditional Japanese company, iterative, agile development is in their DNA.They experiment with a lot of different game mechanics that might be fun, test them early on other people in the office, and then when they find a core mechanic that seems like a game can be built around it, they start fleshing that out, add other mechanics that work as sweeteners, and build up iteratively.Only when they have a good picture of the game do they start piecing together some sort of story or setting that makes the mechanic make sense. Even the IP might be swapped entirely to something that better jives with the mechanic, or just to stick on a brand that will help it sell. That’s why their games stay fresh and fun and they can maintain their innovative edge. reply kqr 2 hours agorootparent> Despite being a very traditional Japanese companyHuh, isn&#x27;t the idea of agile development to lift lean from manufacturing to development? And lean is very Japanese, at least in some sense! reply aikinai 6 minutes agorootparentNo, the philosophies are completely orthogonal. “Lean” might be a shared buzzword, but the meaning is completely different in manufacturing vs software.Toyota Production System, just-in-time manufacturing, and such are about making a running process more efficient and lean over time, but agile software is about being flexible as you develop something brand new, and Japanese companies are still terrible at it. They love waterfall, huge spreadsheets, and explicitly defining absolutely everything up front, often years in advance. None of this is incompatible with the other version of “lean” in manufacturing.* Many (most?) say they do “agile” software now, but that just means breaking the massive waterfall spreadsheet into predefined two week “sprints.” reply doctorpangloss 6 hours agoparentprev> There is absolutely no way to know if that combination of designs will be fun at allAnother perspective is, you shouldn&#x27;t be doing this if you can&#x27;t tell if something is fun without \"testing\" it.> Also, most of your ideas are probably terribleWithout fail, all the people I know who are the best at this keep having one good idea after another.

They can do focused experiences, but their practices cannot scale up, and certainly not to enable the sort of level of variety players want in big titles today.Simply practicing making lots of small games is not enough. It&#x27;s like that saying about going to space: you don&#x27;t get there by climbing progressively taller trees. reply syntheweave 7 hours agorootparentThe full story of id really has a lot to do with the group being built around some extremely motivated people who converged on the same prospects in the same place.Like, the fact that Romero was doing work for Origin and New World, two of the biggest names in that era, working on some of the biggest projects, and then decided that he would drop that to do Softdisk&#x27;s diskmag stuff, is only sensible in the eyes of someone who is extremely focused on being in the room for \"next big things\". And that&#x27;s been a hallmark of Romero&#x27;s career over the long run, really. When shareware games were new, he did shareware games. When mobile gaming was new, he did mobile games. When Facebook games were new, he did Facebook games. I have not checked to see if he did VR(maybe he was already satiated with that by the id experience, which did have some dabblings in that early VR tech) but it would not surprise me at all.So in certain ways, his advice can&#x27;t help, because it&#x27;s advice that&#x27;s about blue ocean markets where all you have to do is be there first and put in a good, serious effort. It&#x27;s not about cultivating long-term fans, even though that did happen to him by chance. reply squeaky-clean 11 hours agorootparentprevAll the more reason to spend time making small games without a goal of profiting from them in order to refine your skills.

But making the vision itself should come from studying games and what made them successful or not. Not grinding out business failures.

I was watching the \"Wha Happun?\" episode about the System Shock remake, and I realized... back in the day we made fun of Romero for his mismanagement of the Daikatana kerfuffle: schedule slip after schedule slip, changing engines twice, the staff quitting and needing to almost be completely replaced, it&#x27;s no wonder the game turned out crap. But so many of today&#x27;s games have most or all of these problems. System Shock (2023) changed engines, had massive staff churn, and considerable schedule slips (taking seven years to Daikatana&#x27;s four), especially when COVID-19 hit. But by paring back the ambition and focusing on delivering an experience faithful to the original, they got it out the door despite doubts from the fan base and it was a hit. So today, some games do turn out good despite mouldering in development hell for the better part of a decade. Of course you still get your fair share of buggy messes (which may be rehabilitated with a post-release patch) and complete misses like Mighty No. 9.So it seems like maybe we&#x27;ve hit a complexity threshold beyond which it stretches human feasibility to turn out a good to great AAA game within a reasonable time frame. And maybe Romero was just one of the first people to \"go big\" with Daikatana, and he hit that threshold before everyone else. His ambition (and ego) exceeded his actual reach, but... few if any had attempted such a large scale project before, aspiring to reinvent the FPS and add RPG and story elements to it. Granted, Half-Life made everybody else look like chumps when it came to embedding story into an FPS -- but Daikatana was announced long before Half-Life congealed.The man deserves full credit for learning from his most famous boondoggle, and focusing on smaller games rather than epic genre-busters that he doesn&#x27;t quite have the ability to manage the development of. reply xnorswap 3 hours agoparentIf you slip 4 or 5 years around now the tech barely changes. You can&#x27;t really tell much the difference between a game delivered in 2018 and 2023, especially if some polish is later added.Whereas back in 1998, there is absolute night and day between 1994 tech (DOOM) and 1998 tech (Quake 2), to the point where the latter makes the former look ancient and almost unplayable in comparison.Keeping in mind also that tech moved so fast that \"serious\" PC gamers would look to upgrade their PC on a much quicker cycle, every couple of years was a game-changing upgrade such as Pentium chips or DDR RAM, or some other new tech that just blew away the previous PC generation.Games companies didn&#x27;t have the luxury to slip years and still deliver on what they started, and any \"engine change\" would have been far more impactful against that background, and also keep in mind that \"changing engine\" back then meant from scratch engines not swapping, say, between Unity and Unreal or some other off the shelf stuff. reply robertlagrant 2 hours agorootparentI hadn&#x27;t thought about it like this, but you&#x27;re right.

Visual: Anthony Delanoix/Unsplash BY TAYLOR MAJEWSKI 09.22.2023 0 COMMENTS R ACHEL NUWER’S “I Feel Love: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World,” is clearly aimed at a broad audience. It will resonate with readers who have experienced MDMA recreationally, probably at a rave, or therapeutically, probably to heal the emotional aftereffects of deep-seated trauma. Or both. But it’s also intended for readers who have never touched the drug, colloquially known as ecstasy or molly. Perhaps it’s especially for them. “I Feel Love” belongs to a growing family of nonfiction accounts of the fraught history of psychedelics and why, through compelling anecdotes and the latest science, we should reconsider them. Nuwer, a science journalist, chronicles the hopeful story of something both small and large — MDMA, the compound, and MDMA, the drug that’s repeatedly brought humans together across decades, continents, politics, and moral panics. The book is a natural successor to Michael Pollan’s 2018 bestseller “How to Change Your Mind,” which covered the mystical and medical benefits of LSD and psilocybin, and paved the way for a psychedelic renaissance of sorts, Nuwer writes in the introduction, “no such modern telling exists for MDMA.” BOOK REVIEW — “I Feel Love: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World,” by Rachel Nuwer (Bloomsbury Publishing, 384 pages). Now, it does. “I Feel Love” is, above all, a time capsule. Nuwer begins with a crucial asterisk: “MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or Molly, is currently an illegal drug.” Today, most journalism around psychedelics is stipulated with this simple fact. Despite their potential to heal, drugs like psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA are still classified as Schedule I, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s highest category for controlled substances with no medical use, with a high potential for abuse. For MDMA specifically, that might be about to change. A team of researchers that included MAPS Public Benefit Corporation — a company developing prescription psychedelics that arose from the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which has been advocating for the legalization of MDMA-assisted therapy since 1986 — published a study on MDMA earlier this month. In it, the researchers suggest that MDMA-assisted therapy is an effective approach for reducing post-traumatic stress disorder. The company plans to submit the results to the Food and Drug Administration, meaning that MDMA, when paired with talk therapy, could potentially be FDA-approved as a treatment for PTSD as early as next year. In many ways, these recent developments feel like the appropriate ending to “I Feel Love.” “Seemingly overnight, MDMA-assisted therapy has emerged in the popular imagination as a miracle cure for otherwise intractable cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans, survivors of sexual violence and childhood abuse, and others haunted by past pain,” Nuwer writes. I’ve found that to be the case in my own reporting — former cult members and sexual assault survivors have told me, with fervor, that MDMA was the thing that healed their trauma. But through meticulous research, Nuwer demonstrates that the therapeutic potential of MDMA wasn’t, in fact, an overnight sensation. Her sharp retelling of MDMA’s history takes readers from Germany in 1912, where Merck first synthesized the drug, to the United States, when the Army briefly considered it for controversial research into a truth serum. In one fascinating tangent, Nuwer quotes one of her many sources, Nicholas Denomme, now a postdoctoral scholar in psychiatry at Stanford University, who notes that “it would be mind-blowing to know” that a drug that’s poised to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD in vets was originally used unethically by the military over 70 years ago. “Seemingly overnight, MDMA-assisted therapy has emerged in the popular imagination as a miracle cure for otherwise intractable cases of post-traumatic stress disorder.” From there, Nuwer chronicles MDMA’s unfurling as a party drug, with ecstasy displacing cocaine as the drug of choice on the dance floor. In the early 1980s, MDMA meccas unfurled in Dallas, Texas, where the drug brought together a “level of diversity seen nowhere else in the Bible Belt.” By the late 1980s, it was in use throughout the U.K., where it allegedly reduced violence at football matches; it also exploded onto the Dutch party scene, and quickly after, made its way to in Berlin. Today, of course, molly — MDMA’s modern moniker and a nickname for “molecule” — powers music festivals around the world. While most of the recent science around MDMA focuses on its therapeutic benefits — for PTSD, addiction, depression, anorexia, social anxiety in autistic adults, and traumatic brain injuries, for example — Nuwer shrewdly points out that relatively little research has been directed toward MDMA’s recreational use. “The largest single population of Ecstasy users is probably still young people in music-focused environments, and for many of them, these are among their most treasured and beautiful life experiences,” says Kevin Balktick, the founder of Horizons, an organization that runs a large annual psychedelic conference. Those treasured and beautiful life experiences are recorded across a spectrum of characters throughout the book. A DJ describes the feeling MDMA invokes as “almost like a religious experience,” one where ecstasy tablets become sacrament. A Vietnam veteran remembers it as an “electric shock to the system.” A couple in their 70s, who have done MDMA dozens of times, say it’s the “antidote to feeling old: we become ageless for a day.” My favorite descriptor is one Nuwer offers from a friend: “What the rush of joy, elation, and love would feel like if you were suddenly reunited with a good friend you hadn’t seen in years, and you stayed up all night talking because you were so happy to see each other.” (It’s funny; The first time I personally took molly, with a close girlfriend, we were locked in conversation for hours, giggling until the sun came up.) At several points throughout the book, it starts to feel as if MDMA can do it all. Through Nuwer’s interviews with scientists and activists, we learn that MDMA can solve marital problems, help cancer patients cope with their realities, save years of therapy, and all but eradicate negative emotions. But Nuwer is careful to cut through those shaky claims with breakneck precision, providing an important bulwark against casual hype.

GIVE NOW Nuwer argues throughout the book that the most common effect of MDMA is imparting a feeling of connection. Perhaps MDMA is simply a lens through which to look at human behavior, as it mirrors our innate desire to tinker with consciousness. “Because our tendency to seek out consciousness-altering experiences has withstood the selective pressures of evolution, scientists surmise that there must be benefits,” she writes. “Some of these benefits probably relate to survival: caffeine to keep us alert and enhance our abilities, opium to relieve pain, alcohol to bring us together.” “But,” she continues, “evidence also indicates that our use of psychoactive substances has shaped us in subtler but perhaps equally powerful ways, by helping mold the customs, beliefs, and traditions that have made our species what it is today.” Will MDMA save the world? Nuwer denounces that idea in her introduction and repeats the sentiment in many corners of the book. Instead, “I Feel Love” offers a foundation of knowledge that’s perhaps needed to push MDMA to the forefront of mental health through a nonalarmist, honest perspective. From there, Nuwer lightly suggests that MDMA might potentially be a solvent for the drivers of loneliness and disconnection — caused by the pandemic, our ever-widening political divide, and the isolation of social media — on the individual level. Either way, you may well be tempted to take MDMA immediately after reading this book.

I was absolutely _broken_ when I came out of high school -- bullied at home and at school just relentlessly for 12 years. Completely unable to relate to other human beings, afraid of being touched, never had a girl friend or any kind of real friendship.Going to rave and having people -- strangers! -- just hug me, and listen to me, and I&#x27;d listen to them and we could just talk to each other like normal people without this undercurrent of constant anxiety and fear of rejection. It was a miracle to me. And I mean that in both the banal sense and the religious sense. It wasn&#x27;t just the interpersonal aspects of it, but like -- having these feelings of joy and happiness and seeing the beauty of the world wash over me in almost an overwhelming way despite the fact that absolutely _nothing_ had really changed about the world made me understand how much of my own unhappiness was internal, that i could _choose_ to see the world in a better light all the time -- not just when I was on drugs, but at any time, it was just a matter of perspective, and something that you have some level of control over.I went from being someone who was almost completely isolated and withdrawn to learning how to DJ, to DJing at the _very same club_ that opened the world to me. I had a girlfriend within a few months, I had dozens of friends, I had a better paying job within a year, largely through connections I made at the club. I honestly think I&#x27;d have just turned into a homeless alcoholic or something without that experience. I have a hard time even imagining where I&#x27;d have ended up. I barely recognize the person that walked into that club the first night.It&#x27;s a tragedy that this drug isn&#x27;t available to more people. I overdid it. A lot of people over did it, but 20 years later I don&#x27;t regret any of it for a moment, even the bad nights. reply SeanAnderson 17 hours agoparentMy experiences echo this nearly to a T.I skipped a few grades in school and became a social outcast. I was hazed out of one school entirely and sort of gave up on understanding people for a while. My first experience on MDMA was like a physical light switch was flicked on inside of my body. I went from only wearing black&#x2F;white&#x2F;gray clothes to being the one known to wear loud colors and really putting myself out there visually and socially. I ended up feeling the need to move away from my home town because I felt \"too popular.\" I couldn&#x27;t go for a run without someone stopping on the side of the street to offer me a ride to wherever. This sort of behavior continued into music festivals where I learned to manage and lead large scale groups of ~strangers in tough environments&#x2F;confusing mindsets.I thought these skills wouldn&#x27;t prove valuable in the work world, but, to my elation and surprise, it was the opposite. A lot of engineers are really smart but a bit weaker on the political and social side of things. I undoubtedly nuked a few brain cells acquiring all these experiences, but hey I can still code just fine and now I love getting in there, talking to people about their feelings and communicating about how I am feeling, and do so with a belief that others are interested in hearing&#x2F;seeing me.10&#x2F;10 would do it all over again. reply davidguetta 18 hours agoparentprevReally good experience myself here.The key overall is always to not abuse and that should be adressed by education, not just mindlessly prohibit everything (even tho it&#x27;s not too bad to forbid stuff somethimes). reply empath-nirvana 18 hours agorootparent> The key overall is always to not abuse and that should be adressed by educationWho is to say what&#x27;s \"abuse\" really.Why would taking MDMA in a therapist chair be \"medicine\" and taking it and dancing all night long be \"abuse\"? Because that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re going to try and control it. I&#x27;m not even sure which would be healthier for you or more effective. Like, obviously there&#x27;s a point where it&#x27;s too much, but if you let the \"medical establishment\" define it, it&#x27;ll definitely be defined as any point in which people might actually be having fun. reply elmomle 18 hours agorootparentNobody in this thread said that taking it to dance all night is abuse; dance can be amazingly cathartic.I&#x27;ve known people who did it nearly daily for long stretches, and others who would only take it once a month and take Prozac after to mitigate and potential damage. I&#x27;m not saying that the latter is the only non-abusive way of taking it, but clearly the former would constitute abuse. reply xp84 17 hours agorootparentThis is one of the most tragic things to me about psychoactive substances in general. I&#x27;ve had and heard of very significant positive experiences from substances, and yet also, obviously, many people become alcoholics all the time, or become barely-functioning stoners who \"wake and bake\" every single day and are incapable of really anything anymore.I think it&#x27;s critical that all of us (however we feel about the &#x27;morality&#x27; of doing drugs) have the humility to acknowledge that there isn&#x27;t any policy \"solution\" to these problems. These are humanity problems (really, animal problems, since any animal can experience addiction and chemical dependence).It is arguably deeply unfair to prohibit people from experiencing the best that these substances have to offer (and I don&#x27;t just mean in a therapy setting). But it&#x27;s also dangerous to \"let\" them get in over their heads. Unfortunately though, the verb \"let\" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. Even well-meaning and trusted parents aren&#x27;t able to effectively guarantee their children&#x27;s safety (either with prohibition or with a more lenient, discussion-based strategy). How much less effective then, is a government which isn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t ever be completely trusted by its citizens? No matter what, we won&#x27;t &#x27;solve&#x27; this with some perfect policy. reply empath-nirvana 17 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;ve had and heard of very significant positive experiences from substances, and yet also, obviously, many people become alcoholics all the time, or become barely-functioning stoners who \"wake and bake\" every single day and are incapable of really anything anymore._Almost everyone_ who uses recreational drugs or drinks stops drinking or doing drugs _on their own_ without any intervention. There&#x27;s this idea that&#x27;s been propagated that drugs are this evil demon that you can never shake once you get addicted, because for people who deal with drug addicts professionally, _all they ever see_ are people who haven&#x27;t quit drugs almost by definition. However, those drug addicts are a _small_ percentage of all the people who have used drugs.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugfoundation.org.nz&#x2F;matters-of-substance&#x2F;archi...Drug policy is basically based on the survivorship bias fallacy. reply kortex 14 hours agorootparentEnlightening article. Indeed, the high comorbidity of substance abuse disorders with other developmental, behavioral, and&#x2F;or executive function disorders, suggests that a lot of it stems directly from untreated congenital conditions. Often the lack of treatment and exacerbation of the condition stem directly from socioeconomic conditions.In other worlds, well-adjusted people with support networks rarely \"get addicted\" to drugs (as if they are some sort of cursed potion that anyone who consumes is afflicted). reply fragmede 17 hours agorootparentprevThe \"medical establishment\" is full of people who like to get high off molly and dance the night away on their weekends. If the medical establishment can say, with science, \"this is, chemically speaking, how much you can do, and how often, and here are the supplements to take, so you don&#x27;t lose the magic\", that would be amazing! reply ivarv 11 hours agorootparentWhile not 100% exactly what you&#x27;re looking for, Huberman Labs episode on MDMA is pretty close. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=slUCmZJDXrk The \"don&#x27;t lose the magic\" supplementation is addressed but it is speculation based on anecdotal evidence and conjecture. reply tempsy 18 hours agorootparentprevBecause MDMA is highly neurotoxic if you&#x27;re not careful with supplementation and do it too often?General rule of thumb is to not even do it more than 1x-2x a year. Even then most people say that it doesn&#x27;t feel as good over time. reply naasking 18 hours agorootparentThe claimed neurotoxicity was based on flawed study that has since been retracted [1]. They mistakenly used methamphetamine instead of MDMA.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;science.1074501 reply tempsy 18 hours agorootparentThat is one study from 2002. There&#x27;s dozens of more recent studies on this subject. By neurotoxicity the question is does frequent use of MDMA make it more difficult for your brain to produce serotonin? Research and anecdotal evidence from recreational users point to this being the case.When your brain becomes dependent on a drug that fries your brain temporarily with serotonin you will not feel as good without the drug if your brain and body becomes dependent on it to trigger normal serotonin production. Doesn&#x27;t sound like a fun time to me.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dancesafe.org&#x2F;drug-information&#x2F;is-mdma-neurotoxic&#x2F;#1 reply empath-nirvana 17 hours agorootparentFrom personal experience of having done it almost weekly for a long stretch (multiple years), and then quitting cold turkey, it took me a few months to fully land back in reality, but I&#x27;ve since had a successful career as a software developer, with a happy and healthy family life, and that&#x27;s typical of the people who I knew back them that I&#x27;ve kept in touch with.Whatever the serotonin generation issues are (and I definitely had them, and that&#x27;s why I stopped taking it), they seem to recover over time. reply naasking 17 hours agorootparentprevYour own link says that the axons fairly quickly regrow from any damage, if it occurs at all which is not at all a settled matter, and it further says that large scale studies show no differences between former users and non-users. Again, these claims of neurotoxicity are exaggerated. reply tempsy 17 hours agorootparent...in your mind frequent long term use of MDMA has no negative long term side effects? reply naasking 17 hours agorootparentNeither of us have any idea of the side-effects of undefined \"frequent\", \"long-term\" use, that&#x27;s my point, and contrary to what you claimed. No serious harm is apparent from the sparse evidence we do have though. reply tempsy 17 hours agorootparentBizarre logical reasoning. So because no one has completed a 100 year study on a powerful drug the default should be to feel safe using it long term instead of not using it?And no there&#x27;s plenty of anecdotal evidence from long term users who never feel the same after frequent use, even after stopping. But again by your logical reasoning because there&#x27;s no peer reviewed study on humans that sufficiently backs this up people should ignore that. reply naasking 17 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s bizarre is how you repeatedly misconstrue someone pointing out that your claims of harm from MDMA are not supported by evidence, into claims that it&#x27;s perfectly safe to use with no qualifications.> And no there&#x27;s plenty of anecdotal evidence from long term users who never feel the same after frequent use, even after stopping.People who use one drug often use others, and often concurrently. People with a history of mental health are also drawn to drugs. We use science to disentangle confounders like this.I have no problem with people advising caution in using powerful drugs, and advising against them fully if they have a family history of mental health issues. I do have a problem when people try to use flawed science to give this caution a false sense of authority, or that elevate anecdotes to the level of general scientific advice. reply projectazorian 13 hours agorootparentprev> And no there&#x27;s plenty of anecdotal evidence from long term users who never feel the same after frequent use, even after stopping.Aging is a thing. Most adults don’t “feel the same” after the passage of a “long term” span of time, regardless of their level of substance use. reply tick_tock_tick 15 hours agorootparentprevDo you have any evidence that it does? Sounds like you&#x27;re trying to straw-man people because you have zero evidence that isn&#x27;t just straight up fraud. reply fragmede 17 hours agorootparentprevOn the spectrum from never doing it, to every weekend until your brain stops being able to produce serotonin, how often would you recommend as reasonable? reply tempsy 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not claiming I know the long term negative side effects on MDMA use, but like any powerful drug why would I not suspect something that floods your brain with serotonin would not end up in a situation where your brain anticipates the drug and creates an dependency situation where your brain does not produce serotonin in normal levels without it? Anecdotal evidence from long term users in MDMA forums suggest lots of frequent users don&#x27;t ever feel the same without it.Bizarre we have gotten to the point where the default is \"take powerful drug because no scientist has proven not to in a century long twin study!!\" reply kortex 13 hours agorootparent> but like any powerful drug why would I not suspect something that floods your brain with serotonin would not end up in a situation where your brain anticipates the drug and creates an dependency situation where your brain does not produce serotonin in normal levels without it?Because this is such an incredible oversimplification of what goes on in the brain. SSRIs also dramatically increase the overall serotonin flux, to the point where if you quit suddenly, the brain is left in a deficit, the effects of which can be quite unpleasant. And contrary to the \"serotonin is happy chemical, more serotonin = more better\" myth, the net result of all this serotonin is that 5-HT receptors actually downregulate. Ultimately, the result of all these changes is an increase in neuroplasticity.Blasting 5-HT receptors (eg by LSD, psilocin, etc, and to an extent MDMA) is also shown to increase neuroplasticity.Neurotoxicity and psychopharmacology are extremely complicated. It&#x27;s beyond reductionist to say \"drug floods brain ergo bad\". reply fragmede 16 hours agorootparentprevLong term abuse to the point that \"users don&#x27;t ever feel the same without it\" is quite concerning and very problematic, but once or twice over the course of a lifetime seems fine.In absence of a century long twin study, I&#x27;d weigh the opinions of millions of people who&#x27;ve taken it a few times, over the secondary source of someone who read something off some random Internet forum (reddit?) from people who are seriously abusing it (like Thursday, Friday, Saturday every weekend). reply _a_a_a_ 17 hours agorootparentprevYou are wrong. Your own link gets a claim to neurotoxicity which is &#x27;backed up&#x27; by this very same flawed study:[1] Hatzidimitriou, McCann, and Ricaurte, “Altered serotonin innervation patterns in the forebrain of monkeys treated with MDMA seven years previously: Factors influencing abnormal recovery”, The Journal of Neuroscience, June 15, 1999, 19(12):5096-5107. Abstract.The same Ricaurte that &#x27;accidentally&#x27; gave excessive methamphetamine to monkeys intsead of MDMA. The same study. reply tempsy 17 hours agorootparentso you&#x27;d have no problem recommending indefinite weekly use of MDMA because in your mind no one has proven there&#x27;s long term negative side effects? reply _a_a_a_ 17 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t strawman me. I just pointed out your link relies on a totally flawed study.I recommended nothing, and I didn&#x27;t say there were no negative side effects.

It was the first time I truly felt free of anxiety, like it just vanished and I could feel somewhat normal. This was many many years ago, and since then I use these experiences as a sort of guiding star. It&#x27;s good to take some every now and then to realign and recalibrate with this feeling. reply MattPalmer1086 12 hours agorootparentSimilarly for me, MDMA opened me out to the possibility of feeling good without the drug.Despite the intense good feeling while you are on it, the understanding that I am basically OK persists afterwards. reply rafaelmn 18 hours agoparentprev> I overdid it.

This is a poor analogy IMO. reply theobromananda 17 hours agorootparentAs someone who has used a larger number of psychedelics, MDMA, ayahuasca and so on - yes, alcohol at 16 for a few years was absolutely life changing for many of the same reasons: increased sociability and being able to talk to people uninhibitely about many things. I didn&#x27;t overdo it and haven&#x27;t drunken alcohol in years. reply naasking 17 hours agorootparentAlcohol can be life changing, but I said \"not life changing like MDMA\". All of the sociability benefits you received from alcohol are achievable via other means that don&#x27;t require the use of drugs, like CBT and plain old practice&#x2F;experience. That is simply NOT the case for MDMA and depression and PTSD. If you think so, then show me examples of alcohol making someone relieved, normal and happy in 30 mins after literally years of depression and suicide attempts. They just aren&#x27;t in the same league. reply jobs_throwaway 17 hours agorootparentprev> Has alcohol ever received any kind of therapeutic recognition, or emergency use authorization to treat PTSD like MDMA?The regulatory status is irrelevant IMO.

Social lubrication&#x2F;chemical courage and delaying pain... both of which can help immensely with the bottom-most tiers in Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy (physiological and safety).

I&#x27;m of the opinion that if a root cause of your issues, and mine, could be established an optimized treatment could be determined that maximizes the beneficial outcome and minimizes the detrimental. My root cause is ADHD &#x2F; dopamine dysregulation and I respond well to medication like Low Dose Naltrexone and Low Dose Modafinil. I think for people with my kind of issues we&#x27;d benefit much more from those than from MDMA even if they are much less fun medications to take. It&#x27;s unfortunate that doctors do a terrible job here so the libertarian part of me is very thankful for the black&#x2F;grey markets and I benefit from the self experimentation of others, at the same time I think it&#x27;s incumbent on me to let others know about alternatives to MDMA that I think are worth exploring. reply kinakomochidayo 7 hours agorootparentThere are some pretty prominent voices like Dr Gabor Mate who think that ADHD stems from stressful family life&#x2F;structure and&#x2F;or traumas growing up.I myself was diagnosed with ADHD, and psychedelics healed me and my past to the point where I no longer needed prescribed stimulants, so it’s possible that MDMA could help. reply klysm 6 hours agorootparentI don’t think I had a remotely stressful family life growing up and I am a near prototypical case of ADHD.

I have experienced the, technically, happiest moments of my life while on MDMA, but ultimately it changed nothing. Like pretty much any drug, it&#x27;s temporary, fake, extreme happiness at the cost of your brain permanently melting from using it too much.I took nothing away from it but increased insight into how unnaturally happy one can be (on drugs) and how incredibly dull, depressing and soul crushing the average work day is.Would I recommend others trying it?

For me, it was not just that I was having the best night of my life, but that I was surrounded by people who were also having the best night of their lives. You could just look around and make eye contact with a random person and you both _knew_.And that community didn&#x27;t just _happen_.

From experience, I can say a night out on MDMA can be almost as lonely&#x2F;alienating as one on ethanol. Still super interesting and fun, but nothing as enlightening as the positive anecdotes above.Example: if you&#x27;re physically attractive, but socially stunted, an MDMA night will give you a taste of The Other Side. If your situation is the other way around, guess what - physically unattractive people are still very much unwelcome on a dance floor, and people will still make that clear to you.This shit is tricky, which is why we need more experienced users in society who can guide newcomers through it. reply bradlys 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve never done MDMA but I have had similar experiences to what is described.

It&#x27;s still available on maps.org (Although they kind of muntzed the formatting) [1] but the takeaway is that besides MDMA there&#x27;s a whole range of other substances with a variety of therapeutic merits to explore. MDMA may hit a sort of sweet-spot quality for more people to tolerate it without adverse reaction kind of sweet spot, however I think the substance Stolaroff was most interested in for enhancement of insight was actually very small doses of 2c-e (you can ctrl+f for it in the link), which I think is something we might end up seeing in more scientific investigations as interest grows.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;thanatos-to-eros-35-years-of-psy... reply fer 18 hours agoparentHaving done both MDMA and 2C-E (mid 00s were pretty good in that sense), in various amounts, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d agree (or disagree, really).Threshold dosages had noticeable impacts in vision or mindset, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything particularly introspective&#x2F;exploratory. That wasn&#x27;t until higher dosages, and only then I felt like it was a rollercoaster, in the sense of intense but very well psychologically attached to the rails. But then again, in those dosages I could hear the echo of my own voice with 15s delay, and just going to the toilet was an adventure full of unexpected events, so I&#x27;m not sure how a therapist can guide that either.MDMA on the other hand softens everything from the smaller doses to the heavy ones, at least until the amphetamine edge starts to take hold. reply jamal-kumar 18 hours agorootparentWhat I remember reading about small doses of 2c-e (Maybe in this book, maybe somewhere else - My interests have shifted a ton over the years to other things) is that the insight enhancement is something that actually ends up happening in the aftermath of the primary effects of the drug.

Why bother chasing that sort of experience? But now having tried most of the commonly used psychedelics, I&#x27;ve come to believe that MDMA is the most profound of them all.MDMA does feel good, of course, but it&#x27;s not escapist. It’s a deep, wholesome, fundamentally healing sort of goodness. It is unconditional, redeeming love and forgiveness — the core of Christian spirituality. It is the revelation that you really are lovable, even your darkest, hidden parts, and that you are capable of love. Debatably, there is no more profound lesson to be learned about the human condition. It really is magical.Even so, the experience is surprisingly subtle. It doesn&#x27;t particularly force positive feelings (\"ecstasy\" is a total misnomer, IMHO). At first you don&#x27;t necessarily even notice any effect at all, maybe just a mildly better-than-average mood. But gradually it becomes clear that this subtle sense of well-being is infinitely deep: nothing you might experience can possibly disturb it. All sense of shame and self-judgement, fear of rejection, hang-ups that get in the way of connecting with people --- all dissolve immediately on contact. And from that sense of absolute safety, the capacity to love emerges naturally. The drug doesn&#x27;t generate it. It just helps you get out of your own way.I&#x27;ve taken MDMA a few times now just on my own at home (lacking a rave community, although I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a fantastic experience also), where it&#x27;s relatively easy to implement harm reduction measures: stay hydrated, take protective supplements, get a full night&#x27;s sleep before and after, and wait multiple months between doses (doing all these, I&#x27;ve never experienced a ‘hangover’, just a positive afterglow). I&#x27;ve found the most rewarding results from trying to keep my attention grounded in bodily sensation, gently returning to the body whenever I notice I&#x27;ve become lost in thought. Often, difficult memories or associations will surface of their own accord, sensing that it&#x27;s safe to do so, and seeing them from a loving perspective can be immensely healing.I really hope we can eventually find our way to making this experience legally and safely available to everyone who wants it. Yes, MDMA has sharp edges; it&#x27;s not as physiologically benign as the classic psychedelics, but it&#x27;s not addictive and it can be used safely. Not everyone has good experiences every time, but compared to the classical psychedelics, it&#x27;s much more reliably positive. It apparently has some effectiveness as a medicine for specific illnesses like PTSD, but IMHO the real condition it treats is much broader: the universal human condition of feeling more walled off than we&#x27;d like to be.One last galaxy-brain thought: if we ever figure out a way to replicate MDMA&#x27;s pro-social effects that people could safely use on a day-to-day basis, it might be the most valuable thing we ever invent.

E.g. for anxiety, try silexan and L-theanine as a first-line thing — they&#x27;re both cheap and have no significant negative side-effects. And other chemicals are really powerful and transformative, and while they need to be considered and&#x2F;or used with extreme care, they may be really good options. I&#x27;d absolutely take the risk of MDMA with proper testing, dosing, and supplementation over the risk to my body from a triathlon, for example.And you should definitely test MDMA, or have someone test it.

There are also labs that can verify via mass spectrometer, free in europe, paid in usa.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dancesafe.org&#x2F;product&#x2F;mdma-testing-kit&#x2F;Purity tests are pretty subjective. People have also been testing their drugs for the presence of fentenayl but it&#x27;s somewhat unlikely due to the drug profile and can throw false positives given the sensitivity of the test sample setup. reply broscillator 11 hours agorootparentprevsome of these drugs are very easy to grow yourself, or know a friend who does reply stephenitis 17 hours agorootparentprevHow much 2nd hand experience have you gathered? Can you describe some scenarios, circumstance, drug of people you observed?I&#x27;m genuinely curious what shaped your view on this. reply wutwutwat 14 hours agoprev [–] It&#x27;s interesting seeing all of the support in this post about MDMA, while methamphetamine has such an ugly stigma associated with it.Yet folks often don&#x27;t even realize the \"MA\" in \"MDMA\" is in fact, methamphetamine. Meth is just a stimulant, while MDMA is a psychedelic, making you trip. It&#x27;s weird that the stimulant has such a bad reputation, but not the one that literally will cause you to see and experience things that do not exist, which has that big ole junkie drug meth in it even!Not defending meth, or any drug for that matter. I&#x27;m just pointing out the weird bias we have with things. For some reason meth is an outcask, yet many \"acceptable\" drugs include meth and people don&#x27;t even really know that. Take meth to a party and get kicked out or be looked at like a junkie. Take MDMA to a party and you&#x27;re a hero. Even with drugs, we find a way to create a pecking order reply tredre3 14 hours agoparent> It&#x27;s interesting seeing all of the support in this post about MDMA, while methamphetamine has such an ugly stigma associated with it.That&#x27;s because having similar names does not make them similar in any way. \"M D M A\" isn&#x27;t a list of ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t contain methamphetamine. They have some chemical similarity, but their effects are very different. Once you understand this, you can see that people chastising meth but liking mdma aren&#x27;t being hypocrites. reply kortex 13 hours agorootparent> That&#x27;s because having similar names does not make them similar in any way.Well yes, but actually no. Right answer, but the work to get there is a little off.MDMA is MethyleneDioxy MethAmphetamine. And MethAMPhetAmine is n-methyl alpha-methyl phenethylamine (chemists love portmanteaus). So it&#x27;s literally a methamphetamine core with a methylenedioxy bridge. That structural similarity gives MDMA some similarity in activity to MA, which itself works due to its similarly to dopamine and epinephrine.Structural similarities give you a good guess but you really have to test the binding affinities on their own. There are substituted phenethylamines which have barely any activity.MA itself has found therapeutic uses in treating ADHD and narcolepsy. Side note: this is why NO drug should ever be \"Schedule I - no medical uses\". How can you ever predict a lack of future medical uses? Cannabis, psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, ibogaine, these have all found therapeutic uses, yet are sched I. reply ipnon 14 hours agoparentprevThis is a dangerous analogy because single atom differences in a molecule can change it from a medicine to a poison. While all drugs are not problems in themselves, only in how they are used in individuals and society, it would not be wise to extrapolate from a positive MDMA experience that consuming methamphetamine is a sound course of action.Do your research folks! reply mtreis86 12 hours agorootparentJust to pile on, change in chirality can also result in wholly different chemicals. reply callalex 13 hours agoparentprevThis is the same old busted argument that people use to describe methylphenidate (Ritalin) as meth and pretend everyone with the mental illness ADHD is just a junkie. reply rgmerk 14 hours agoparentprevThat’s a very strange argument.When was the last time you heard of MDMA-fuelled crime sprees? reply barbs 12 hours agoparentprevWhilst your point about lateral violence is valid, your reasoning is ignorant. MDMA might be molecularly similar to meth, they are different drugs with different effects. Also, the term \"junkie\" is stigmatizing. reply renewiltord 14 hours agoparentprev [–] It’s weird but Fritz Haber pioneered the use of a chemical weapon that people just casually flavor their food with.
