You can get the update directly from beeper.com/update on your phone. We are still doing some final testing before submitting the update to the Google Play Store for distribution to all users. If you encounter any issues, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Update: The update is now live on Google Play. We even added in a few new feature improvements: chats now open at the last unread message, and we polished the video player a bit! Four other things to note: The security and privacy of Beeper Mini is unchanged. It is still local, end-to-end encrypted on your device, as we described in our post. Phone number registration is not working yet. All users must now sign in with an AppleID. Messages will be sent and received via your email address rather than phone number. We’re currently working on a fix for this. We’ve made Beeper free to use. Things have been a bit chaotic, and we’re not comfortable subjecting paying users to this. As soon as things stabilize (we hope they will), we’ll look at turning on subscriptions again. If you want to keep supporting us, feel free to leave the subscription on 🙂. Our Play Store ranking dropped precipitously on Friday. Leaving us a nice review there would help tremendously. It’s been an extremely busy, tiring, exciting, and eventful week. Props to the entire Beeper team for working basically 24/7 to get Beeper Mini working again. Huge thanks to you, the Beeper and broader community, for supporting us. What happened Beeper Mini launched on Tuesday and rocketed to top 20 of Play Store charts. It was an instant hit. From what we can tell, Beeper Mini was the fastest growing paid Android application launch in history. In the first 48 hours, it was downloaded by more than 100,000 people. The reason for its success is clear: Android and iPhone customers desperately want to be able to chat together with high quality images/video, encryption, emojis, typing status, read receipts, and all modern chat features. We all want a fun, easy and secure way to chat. For a glorious 3 days last week, Beeper Mini made this possible. On Friday, we started getting reports that Beeper Cloud and Beeper Mini users could not send or receive messages. We investigated the issue and started working on a fix. Within 24 hours, we fixed the issue for Beeper Cloud and published an update. Beeper Cloud users can now send and receive messages. It’s working exactly as it did before Friday. Note: Beeper Cloud’s new Oct 2023 iMessage bridge never used Mac relay servers and still does not today. It uses a similar method to Beeper Mini, but runs on a cloud server. At the same time, we took steps to deregister all phone numbers associated with Beeper Mini, and we sent push notifications to all users updating them on the situation. In hindsight, our timing was a mistake: we should have communicated to our users sooner. We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused by the outage. Today, less than 3 days later, we are publishing an update to fix Beeper Mini. Users can now sign in, send and receive messages. Beeper Mini is back. Despite reaching out, we still have not heard anything directly from Apple. Apple’s statement I got a call from David Pierce over at The Verge on Saturday. Apple had sent them a statement: At Apple, we build our products and services with industry-leading privacy and security technologies designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information safe. We took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage. These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks. We will continue to make updates in the future to protect our users. We—of course—expected a response. What we didn’t expect was 1984-esque doublespeak. The statement is complete FUD. Beeper Mini made communication between Android and iPhone users more secure. That is a fact. Make no mistake, the changes Apple made on Friday were designed to protect the lock-in effect of iMessage. The end result is that iPhone customers have less security and privacy than before. Before Beeper Mini, Messages app (the default chat app on iPhone) forced all iPhone customers to send unencrypted, unsecure green bubble SMS messages to Android friends, family and colleagues. Even worse, when iPhone customers added an Android phone number to an existing iMessage secure encrypted group chat, the Messages app would by default switch the entire group chat to using unencrypted, unsecure SMS. This immediately made communication between iPhone customers in the group chat less secure. Beeper Mini fixed this problem (and many others), and made it possible for Android and iPhone customers to enjoy a secure, easy and high quality chat experience. We are working to make chat more secure, and enable consumer choice. Many people have asked, ‘why don’t people just use Signal or WhatsApp?’. The answer is that Messages App is the default chat app for all iPhone customers. Not only is it the default, iOS makes it impossible to change the default chat app. In the US, where the majority of people have iPhones, this means that the easiest way to chat is by tapping on your friend’s name in your contact list and hitting the ‘message’ button. We deeply object to the allegation that Beeper Mini ‘poses significant risks to user security and privacy’. This is completely untrue. As we explained above, the opposite is actually true. Beeper Mini increases the security and privacy of both Android and iPhone customers. To prove this, we published a detailed blog post about how the app keeps data secure and private. Beeper Mini is end-to-end encrypted. The underlying connection method is open source, for anyone to review. Today, we’re taking that dedication to security and privacy even further. If Apple doubts the security and privacy of our app, we’re willing to share the entire Beeper Mini codebase with a mutually agreed upon 3rd party security research firm. If Apple insists, we would consider adding a pager emoji 📟 to metadata on all messages sent via Beeper Mini. This would make it easy for Messages App to filter out any messages from Beeper Mini users. At the end of the day, we are committed to building the best chat app on earth. We will continue working on that.

Google: everything we’re learning live in Fortnite court By Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011. Share this story The future of Google’s app store is at stake in a lawsuit by Fortnite publisher Epic Games. Epic sued Google in 2020 after a fight over in-app purchase fees, claiming the Android operating system’s Google Play store constituted an unlawful monopoly. It wanted Google to make using third-party app stores, sideloaded apps, and non-Google payment processors easier — while Google said its demands would damage Android’s ability to offer a secure user experience and compete with Apple’s iOS. On December 11th, the jury ruled in Epic’s favor, finding that Google has turned its Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly, answering yes to every question in front of them about Google’s monopoly power, anticompetitive behavior, and the illegal ties between the different parts of its business. Follow along with all of our updates below. Highlights Epic win: Jury decides Google has illegal monopoly in app store fight A fortnight in Fortnite court Federal judge vows to investigate Google for intentionally destroying chats How will the jury decide Epic v. Google? An antitrust lawyer weighs in. Activision Blizzard had a plan — or ploy — to launch its own Android game store TODAY, 1:31 AM UTC Sean Hollister And here is Epic's celebratory blog post after the Epic v. Google ruling. In case you're wondering why Tim Sweeney was thanking jurors on behalf of one million developers... it's part of this blog post too. Epic v Google Trial Verdict, a Win for All Developers [Epic Games] TODAY, 1:25 AM UTC Sean Hollister Epic win: Jury decides Google has illegal monopoly in app store fight Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge Three years after Fortnite-maker Epic Games sued Apple and Google for allegedly running illegal app store monopolies, Epic has a win. The jury in Epic v. Google has just delivered its verdict — and it found that Google turned its Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly. After just a few hours of deliberation, the jury unanimously answered yes to every question put before them — that Google has monopoly power in the Android app distribution markets and in-app billing services markets, that Google did anticompetitive things in those markets, and that Epic was injured by that behavior. They decided Google has an illegal tie between its Google Play app store and its Google Play Billing payment services, too, and that its distribution agreement, Project Hug deals with game developers and deals with OEMs were all anticompetitive. Read Article > TODAY, 1:17 AM UTC Sean Hollister Google will appeal the Epic v. Google verdict. We plan to challenge the verdict. Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform. The trial made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles. We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem. - Wilson White, VP, Government Affairs & Public Policy That's not surprising: a jury gave Epic a total victory today. Epic win: Jury decides Google has illegal monopoly in app store fight Sean Hollister 1:25 AM UTC TODAY, 12:38 AM UTC Sean Hollister Here is Tim Sweeney’s victory tweet following the Epic v. Google verdict: “Victory over Google! After 4 weeks of detailed court testimony, the California jury found against the Google Play monopoly on all counts. The Court’s work on remedies will start in January. Thanks for everyone’s support and faith! Free Fortnite!” TODAY, 12:25 AM UTC Sean Hollister In the hallway, Epic's attorneys are taking photos with the jurors. The jury is all smiles. \"The one million game developers who couldn't be here thank you,\" says Sweeney, as they head into the elevator and down out of the courthouse. TODAY, 12:19 AM UTC Sean Hollister Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has a huge smile on his face, and is shaking hands. He thanked Google’s lead attorney Glenn Pomerantz “for being very professional,” and clapped Epic’s lead attorney Gary Bornstein on the back. Attorneys for both sides will meet with the judge in the second week of January to discuss next steps. TODAY, 12:07 AM UTC Sean Hollister The jury is returning to the courtroom now. The judge says he will read it out. TODAY, 12:06 AM UTC Sean Hollister We have a verdict in Epic v. Google. Stand by... attorneys and journalists have filed back into the courtroom. We’re waiting for the judge and jury now. Epic v. Google: everything we’re learning live in Fortnite court Adi Robertson 1:31 AM UTC Dec 11 Sean Hollister We’re done with closing arguments in Epic v. Google. Bornstein asked the jury to carefully read the jury instructions because Google apparently cherry-picked a sentence to point out to them earlier. He also asked them to consider whether Google tried to nip competition in the bud before it could ever emerge. The jury filed out, the judge thanked both parties for preparing the case well and arguing it efficiently... and now, we’re done until there’s a verdict! It sounds like the jury will eat lunch before beginning deliberations, so I should have time to grab some food as well. Dec 11 Sean Hollister Epic: “I agree with Google, we need to look at the real world.” Epic is getting eight minutes of rebuttal to Google’s closing argument, and lead attorney Gary Bornstein is using part of it to argue this: we should look at the internal documents in this case to see what’s actually going on. “What did they say in their documents? That tells you what they believed in the real world.” He begins by showing one of the emails Google showed us about reacting to an Apple change in price — and that Google chose not to follow that price change at the time. “They chose not to change their price despite believing that Apple was changing theirs,” he says, and “during that time not a single developer pulled out of the Play Store to focus on iOS.” Dec 11 Sean Hollister Google points out Epic has never shown a less restrictive way to collect its fee. Kravis says it’s a “reliable and efficient way to collect the fee” to tie it to its own billing system — which is why every other app and game platform does it the same way, he claims. Dec 11 Sean Hollister Hah, yes, Google is also visually showing the jury which box it believes they should check on the verdict form. But unlike Epic, it’s using red X’s instead of check marks on its visual aids. Dec 11 Sean Hollister “We would all love to get something amazing for free.” Google has come around to Tim Sweeney’s “billions” quote once again, painting Epic as a self-serving company. The antitrust laws do not require Google to give up its services for free, says Kravis. He also took us back to the testimony of an Epic employee who was more than uncomfortable with Epic’s Project Liberty trap for Google, asking, “Are we just pawns in Tim’s game?” Dec 11 Sean Hollister Google addresses the chat elephant in the room — briefly. “I’m sorry, your honor, but I believe this is contrary to the court’s order,” interrupts Epic lead attorney Gary Bornstein, The judge lets Google’s attorney proceed but tells him to “walk carefully.” “Consider this: the facts remain unchanged. The data remains unchanged,” begins Kravis. “Time and again during this trial, you saw Epic overreach,” he adds, explaining how Epic wasn’t able to prove things like Project Hug were direct bribes or that Samsung was in collusion with Google. Perhaps thinking about the judge’s warning, Epic moves on — Kravis is now pointing out that Epic is just trying to get a free ride on Google Play now. Here’s one quote from that: “Epic can’t pocket the money in its own store and then stand up here and tell you it’s trying to protect the consumer.” Dec 11 Sean Hollister “A monopolist shouldn’t be worried about its customers trying to choose other options, because they don’t have other options.” Just a good quote about Google’s testimony, which I don’t think quite lands because Google’s internal emails show the company was actively worried about “other options” arising on Android if Google didn’t take action. Dec 11 Sean Hollister Google tries to shoot down its Hug. “At the beginning of this trial, Epic told you it would prove three of the 21 Project Hug agreements were payoffs... the evidence has shown nothing like that. The written agreements don’t say anything like this,” Kravis tells the jury. “You can review them during your deliberations, and when you do, you will see they say nothing — nothing — about developers not being able to open their competing app stores.” He points out even Epic CEO Tim Sweeney didn’t believe Activision Blizzard truly wanted to open its own app store. Dec 11 Sean Hollister “They didn’t provide any testimony from an Android phone manufacturer — we did.” That’s Google, referring us to a Motorola exec’s testimony that Motorola found it was a competitive advantage to ship with Google apps. “This is an android phone manufacturer telling you this helps us build better phones at a lower cost — this is pro competitive,” says Kravis. Mind you, the Motorola testimony is also when we saw that Google does directly pay some OEMs not to preload rival app stores. Dec 11 Sean Hollister Google is bashing Epic’s sideloading argument hard. “Epic’s own expert admitted this is all the Android operating system itself requires for sideloading: three steps. And remember, you only have to go through this process once,” says Kravis. “He just thinks the steps should be compressed.” “What evidence did you see during this trial that compressing three steps into two steps or one step would fix this alleged harm?” Kravis rhetorically asks the jury. I’ve thought for a while that Epic mostly lost the sideloading argument, and Google’s really driving it home. Dec 11 Sean Hollister “Right next to each other on the homescreen.” We’re back to Google suggesting the Galaxy Store side by side on the homescreen with the Google Play Store (as it is on modern Samsung phones) is evidence of competition. “Those consumers choose the Play Store 83 percent of the time — this is Google winning the competition because it has a better store,” says Kravis. Dec 11 Sean Hollister Google says Epic was not forced to use Google’s billing system — because players clearly bought V-Bucks elsewhere. Now we know why Google made this point earlier in the trial. Dec 11 Sean Hollister Google turns Fortnite against Epic again. Kravis just showed the jury a slide showing all the ways to play Fortnite, including the PC, Nintendo Switch, cloud gaming and more. “Professor Tucker’s market definition is the only one that accounts for all these other choices,” he says. “What’s missing from [Epic’s economist’s] charts is all the other choices that consumers and developers have.” Dec 11 Sean Hollister “Our competitors are charging a lower price: how can we respond?” Google says the evidence shows that Google competes with Apple on price, that we’ve repeatedly seen the two lower their service fees to compete with one another. “This is not the behavior of a monopolist,” Kravis tells the jury. “We don’t dispute that Google competes with other stores on Android,” he says, only that he wants to show that competition extends to Apple. (Epic had repeatedly shown Apple wasn’t listed in Google’s internal documents about app store competitors.) Dec 11 Sean Hollister “These numbers are really concerning to Google — Google doesn’t want to lose 60 million users to the iPhone every year.” Kravis spent a decent chunk of Google’s closing argument fighting against the idea that users won’t switch between iOS and Android and ended that section once again suggesting that even if the percentage of switchers is small, the absolute number is large. He also had a memorable line about the lag we’ve seen between apps appearing on iOS and Android: “What Purnima told you, and the evidence shows, is that app developers are like the rest of us. They have to prioritize, they have to decide which apps to build first.” Dec 11 Sean Hollister “Because Apple and Google are in the same market, Google cannot have monopoly power.” That seems straightforward enough — if jurors decide that Apple vs. Google is the relevant market. Google’s attorney suggests that because Apple has 64 percent of app store revenues, period, Google is too small to have monopoly power. Now, he’s attempting to say that app stores are critical to phone buyers to the point that Apple competes with Google on that level: “They take it home, they turn it on, it’s got a lousy app store on it... you don’t need a PhD in economics to know what’s going to happen next... they’re going to buy another phone.” Dec 11 Sean Hollister “PayPal and Stripe do not deliver apps to billion of consumers around the world.” Kravis is going fast and fierce. “Epic wants you to give them a deal they have not been able to get anywhere else... a deal that would effectively allow them to use the Play Store for free.” Pagination Page 1 of 26Next Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Search Menu Blog Contact What We Do Practices Clients Billing Philosophy Our Team Attorneys Fellows Staff About Us Our Firm Our Culture Diversity News & Insights Firm News Publications Blog Careers Open Positions Fellowship Program Offices Law Enforcement House Intelligence Committee FISA “Reform” Bill Would Greatly Expand the Class of Businesses and Other Entities Required to Assist in FISA 702 Surveillance Published: Dec. 08, 2023 Marc Zwillinger Steve Lane Yesterday the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously approved the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 (FRRA), which would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA 702). The full House is expected to vote on this bill next Tuesday. Like other competing reauthorization bills that have been introduced (see here and here), the FRRA would impose new restrictions on the government’s access to and use of information about U.S. persons that has been incidentally acquired pursuant to FISA 702, a provision that permits the government to conduct warrantless surveillance of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. Although the FRRA is ostensibly a reform bill, it contains one notable provision that would significantly expand the government’s authority under FISA 702 by broadening the definition of “electronic communication service providers” (ECSPs) whom the government may compel to assist in FISA 702 surveillance. The statutory definition of ECSP currently covers: (1) a telecommunications carrier; (2) a provider of an electronic communication service or a remote computing service, as defined in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act; (3) “any other communication service provider who has access to wire or electronic communications either as such communications are transmitted or as such communications are stored”; and (4) an officer, employee, or agent of any such entity. Section 504 of the FRRA would broaden the “catch all” definition in (3) above to cover: “any service provider who has access to wire or electronic communications either as such communications are transmitted or as such communications are stored or equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store such communications.” Section 504 would also expand the definition in (4) above to include not only an officer, employee, or agent of an ECSP, but also any “custodian” of such an entity. These changes would vastly widen the scope of businesses, entities, and their affiliates who are eligible to be compelled to assist 702 surveillance. By including any “service provider”—rather than any “other communication service provider”—that has access not just to communications, but also to the “equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store . . . communications,” the expanded definition would appear to cover data centers, colocation providers, business landlords, shared workspaces, or even hotels where guests connect to the Internet. And the addition of the term “custodian” in (4) above could be understood to sweep in any third party involved in providing equipment, storage, or even cleaning services to such entities. The FRRA’s new definition of ECSP would effectively overrule recent decisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) that interpreted the current “catch all” definition much more narrowly, seemingly to exclude those communication service providers who merely have access to equipment on which communications are transmitted or stored. The expanded definition would also effectively restore the broad assistance provision of Section 702’s predecessor, the Protect America Act, which Congress specifically rejected when it originally enacted Section 702 as part of the FISA Amendments Act. The new definition, when combined with NSA’s ability to conduct “upstream collection,” could give the government warrantless access to any communication system in America through which any one-side-foreign communication could be found. If the FRRA is enacted in its current form, the broadened definition of ECSP could put U.S. companies that offer co-location computer storage and commercial landlords at a competitive disadvantage to foreign service providers and property owners given the possibility that customer or tenant communications could be obtained from them.

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT To Revive Portland, Officials Seek to Ban Public Drug Use State and local leaders are proposing to roll back part of the nation’s pioneering drug decriminalization law and step up police enforcement. Share full article Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon said officials hoped to restore a sense of safety for both visitors and workers in Portland’s urban core. Credit... Amanda Lucier for The New York Times By Mike Baker Reporting from Portland, Ore. Dec. 11, 2023 After years of rising overdoses and an exodus of business from central Portland, Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon said on Monday that state and city officials are proposing to roll back a portion of the nation’s most wide-ranging drug decriminalization law in a bid to revive the troubled city. Under the plan brokered by Gov. Kotek, a Democrat, state lawmakers would be asked to consider a ban on public drug use and police would be given greater resources to deter the distribution of drugs. Ms. Kotek said officials hoped to restore a sense of safety for both visitors and workers in the city’s beleaguered urban core, which has seen an exodus of key retail outlets, including REI, an institution in the Pacific Northwest. “When it comes to open-air drug use, nobody wants to see that,” Ms. Kotek said in an interview. “We need different tools to send the message that that is not acceptable behavior.” Along with new drug use prohibitions and an expanded police presence, a task force led by the governor also proposed a moratorium on new taxes and other tax relief targeted at encouraging businesses to remain in the city. The group also called for increased services for homeless residents, including more shelter capacity, and emergency declarations at multiple levels of government to help open more services to people struggling with drug addiction. Oregon voters in 2020 approved the nation’s first law decriminalizing possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including fentanyl, heroin and methamphetamines. The ballot measure sought to end the use of jail as a punishment for drug users and instead treat addiction as a health issue. The effort was to be joined with major new investments in drug treatment, but those new systems have been slow to develop. In the meantime, cities around the country have been struggling to manage both widespread homelessness and an overdose crisis spurred by the rapid spread of fentanyl, a particularly addictive drug that is both cheap and deadly. In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed has pressed to arrest drug users, saying “tough love” is sometimes needed. Last month, Seattle implemented a new law that prohibits possession of drugs and public use. Image Police respond to a man who died of a suspected overdose in downtown Portland in July. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Image Empty cartridges of Kloxxado, a naloxone nasal spray that is twice as concentrated as Narcan, lay on the street after a security guard used four of them to revive a man in Portland. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times “Portland is changing,” Ms. Kotek said, adding that the new approach could be a model for other cities. Multnomah County, which includes Portland, has been approaching 500 overdose deaths a year, up from about 200 in 2019, and statewide deaths were up 28 percent over the past year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the second highest jump in the nation, behind Washington State. In September, the Portland City Council approved a ban on public drug use that comes with a potential punishment of six months in jail, but the measure will only go into effect if lawmakers change state law. Advocates for drug-policy reform expressed alarm about the prospect of bringing back criminal penalties for drug use. Tera Hurst, the executive director of the nonprofit Health Justice Recovery Alliance, said the focus should be on providing people access to services. She noted that many people struggling with addiction have challenges accessing services. Putting the emphasis on prosecution and policing effectively criminalizes poverty, Ms. Hurst said, as many of the people using drugs publicly are homeless. And she expressed fear that people will instead seek to use drugs in private, where they have a higher chance of overdosing. “When we push it back into the criminal system, it pushes people back into the shadows,” Ms. Hurst said. “People will die because of this.” The arrival of fentanyl and a potent new methamphetamine has brought new challenges with Oregon’s more open drug policies, including people dealing with deeper addiction and mental health struggles than before, said Dr. Andy Mendenhall, the president and C.E.O. of Central City Concern, a nonprofit focused on helping the homeless. His nonprofit supported the passage of Measure 110, the drug decriminalization initiative. He said he continued to support the overall decriminalization effort, though he recognized the need for modifications. “We are in a very strong position of, ‘Revise, do not repeal,’” he said. He said there was value in offering people treatment as a diversion option during a criminal process. Dr. Mendenhall works in the Old Town neighborhood of downtown. Tents cover the sidewalks in some places, with some people lying motionless near the street and others exhibiting clear signs of mental illness, a scene that Dr. Mendenhall said can leave visitors feeling unsafe. Three weeks ago, he said, he was walking between meetings in the neighborhood when someone flagged him down to call attention to a young man who was not breathing. Dr. Mendenhall reached into his bag to pull out a dose of naloxone, which helps treat overdoses. He said it took four doses and rescue breathing to revive the man.

Amanda Lucier for The New York Times After paramedics arrived, he said, the man chose not to go to the hospital or to be immediately connected with addiction treatment services. Ms. Kotek’s task force does not have the power to immediately ban public drug use, but the panel called for the Legislature to take up the issue in the coming session along with changes that could reduce barriers to prosecuting those who deliver drugs. Lawmakers have already been discussing potential changes to the decriminalization law, and some key legislators were part of Ms. Kotek’s task force. Marcy Landolfo, a Portland business owner, said that the effort was overdue. One of her retail businesses, Rains, a wet weather gear and clothing store, endured 15 break-ins over the span of about two years before she decided to shutter the store, she said. Her other store outside of the central city had a break-in last week. Ms. Landolfo said she supported the decriminalization plan when it was on the ballot in 2020. But after learning more about the effects of drugs like methamphetamine and seeing the challenges throughout the city, she said, she welcomed an effort to ban public drug use and try to reclaim the city. The future of Portland looks promising, Ms. Landolfo said, adding that she hopes she can one day reopen the store she closed, as the city recovers. “I truly believe we hit rock bottom,” Ms. Landolfo said. “I’m sticking around for when it gets good again.” Mike Baker is a national reporter for The Times, based in Seattle.

    "commentBody": "To revive Portland, officials seek to ban public drug use (nytimes.com)253 points by mikhael 14 hours agohidepastfavorite656 comments legitster 12 hours agoDrug legalization is something I have come 180 on (or at least, 90 degrees). Portland did everything! They invested huge sums in shelters, treatment programs, counsellors, etc. ODs have more than doubled, and the shelters are half empty! They are not one more social program away from cleaning out the streets. I think the experiment has radically failed and I'm ready to say I was wrong. While I don't want to go back to locking people in jail just for being addicts, cities still need to be a place that people actually want to live in. Revenue prospects for the city are becoming horrid and there is not a lot of runway to continue throwing money at the problem. reply CydeWeys 11 hours agoparentThe first priority should be cleaning up the cities for the benefit of the actual taxpayers. Absolutely do not let drug addicts overwhelm your downtown cores and make them terrible. You don't need to lock them up indefinitely, but you do need to move them somewhere else where they won't have hugely negative effects on the city and its populace. It may not make life for the addicts better, but it won't make life for them much worse either, while it will make life for everyone else substantially better -- and we should be prioritizing the welfare of the productive members of society who actually pay to make all of it possible. Right now way too many cities have lost the plot by being too permissive of violations of the social contract, and everyone suffers as a result. reply vineyardmike 5 hours agorootparentI hate the messaging of “for the actual taxpayers” phrase even if I agree mostly with the sentiment. There is more to life than paying taxes, and people contribute to society in many ways that aren’t financial. I think “productive members” has the same phrasing problems. We need to make life better for members of society that contribute and benefit from it, for people that want to be a part of society, regardless of their ability to contribute back. reply freetanga 5 hours agorootparentWell, I agree halfway… at the core of any social contract are rights and obligations. I think part of those obligations are to contribute to society (I think we agree up to this point) However, I believe a part of that contribution has to be in an objective, quantifiable way - which translates to taxes. The rights we consume from society are tangible and expensive. A city populated only by of poets would collapse of starvation after 12 hours… That said, if a Society feels they need to foster a specific part of it (culture,social work, etc) they can enact tax breaks to reduce the financial load of those making that contribution. But taxation comes first (as an obligation). reply smallnix 3 hours agorootparentWhat about raising children? reply taskforcegemini 2 hours agorootparentis not a contribution by default? reply flir 4 hours agorootparentprevSo which do you prefer to tack on the end of that: \"...except for the disabled\" or \"...and to hell with the disabled\"? Both are widely used. reply freetanga 4 hours agorootparentI have people with disabilities in my family so I know their realities up close - unlike most leftist politicians who only seek them for photo ops. My wife volunteers pro-bono in a foundation that employs solely people with disabilities. They do work (according to their capacities), they get paid a wage, and they pay (little) taxes off it. And they are super proud that they can “pull their weight” and be equals in a society that tends to look down on them either as limited (usually from the right) or as “must-be-kept-cotton-balled” (usually from the left). They want to be seen as people, which is what they are. reply thwarted 2 hours agorootparentprevThere is more to life than paying taxes Exactly. You don't pay taxes to pay taxes, you pay taxes for the collective benefits you get out of it. Paying taxes and not getting the benefits of safe cities, clean roads, parks, and all the other things that government does, then you are living life only to pay taxes. reply tw04 5 hours agorootparentprevBut our society rewards your societal contributions via monetary rewards which results in you paying taxes. Sure, the money you get does not necessarily reflect the value of you contributions fairly in most cases, but I think I can count on one hand the number of people I have met in my life that pay no taxes and are still a net benefit to society. And not paying taxed can be because they have no job and make no money, or are so rich as to be able to write off all their income because they think they don’t owe anyone anything. reply roenxi 2 hours agorootparentprev> There is more to life than paying taxes, and people contribute to society in many ways that aren’t financial. What are they, and can I do them instead of paying taxes? Because paying taxes soaks up double digit percentages of my productive time and I reckon I could add a lot more value to society if I had alternatives. reply prawn 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you can provide services (shelters, etc) AND crackdown with a view to cleaning the city for regular people (rather than just specifying taxpayers). reply fragmede 3 hours agorootparentMore than a service, bring back the projects. Yes there were problems with them the last time around, but the problem we have now seems worse on all fronts. reply dtx1 4 hours agorootparentprevThe sad reality is that current forms of law enforcement aren't working when it comes to hard drugs and addiction. Putting people in prison for getting addicted to crack is not exactly going to make anyones lifes better. But it has also become quite obvious that you can't have free-range junkies shooting up in what is supposed to be the economic center of a city. I suspect in a few decades forced rehab will become the norm, once you start smoking crack or shooting up in the street. It's pretty obvious for anyone with eyes that at a certain point, homelessness, mental health issues and most importantly drug addiction cannot be covered by \"individual freedom\" anymore if you want to have a working society. Of course, having police beat up and arrest or otherwise forcefully move addicts from one place to another or into the prison industrial complex is not likely to work. reply bbor 5 hours agorootparentprevIt may not make life for the addicts better, but it won't make life for them much worse either Seems like a hard claim to back up. What would “moving” the homeless from, say, Portland look like? Setting up a giant slum on Mount Tabor? Building a network of trailer parks? I can’t imagine any answer to “let’s concentrate all these undesirables somewhere where we don’t have to look at them and they can’t interrupt us” that ends up being a nice trip for said undesirables Think about why homeless people go to downtown centers of big cities: community, institutional support nearby, income, tradition, and (relative) safety from police. How would you turn that back? What do you do if someone walks from your camp back to downtown? I totally understand your frustration, but our failure so far should lead us to examine the obvious structural issues at fault here, and not abandon our fellow man and give in to the more basic instincts to push them away reply gigatexal 4 hours agoparentprevFormer Portland native here: it hasn’t worked. I was back just a year or two ago and 5th ave near the waterfront was overrun with homeless openly shooting up and accosting folks. All the food carts across from the building where I used to work left, the Indian buffet restaurant closed, walking up around 10th near the Target to check out other restaurants I loved many I saw many barricaded former businesses. The city used to be beautiful. It used to be vibrant and bustling with people and tourists and working professionals but when I was there last retracing my steps as if I was working and living there again it was not the Portland I remember. It’s disheartening. That’s not to say I’m blaming the homeless or those addicted to substances or dealing with mental Health problems. I’m not. I believe in helping people when they can’t help themselves. But allowing open drug use, camping in front of businesses, etc., doesn’t do much for said businesses and people to invest in your city leaving you with less tax revenue to help these very same folks with. reply stillwithit 4 hours agorootparentWFH means biz isn’t coming back there any time soon even with the homeless gone. It’s why homeless are downtown now rather on the fringe; fringe used to be emptier more frequently as downtown filled. Now folks are home on the fringe all the time. I was just downtown for lunch on weekday and it was a ghost town. I worked for PSU for years, am aware of what it should look like and it’s just dead. That’s been the case since 2020. If you want services, good luck. Feds extracted that money and feed it to cloud app companies to keep you all happy and you still aren’t. Let’s keep giving Elon forever to fail to reach Mars and complain government experiments are failures right away. Americans have a credibility problem. Work less and less but expect more and more because we have a lot of hallucinated wealth. Where do the real workers come from if everyone is doing office work? Now that other nations have matured after WW2 rebuild, how do we justify taking more for less output? 1945-2000s was a statistical anomaly. America needs to sober up. reply twelve40 2 hours agorootparentI don't buy this \"WFH makes downtowns drug-ridden war zones\" dichotomy. I've been to downtown Portland before Covid, and it was pretty repulsive, just like SF. Sure, it has deteriorated in both places since, but that was not pre-determined. WFH != war zone in downtown. reply GoblinSlayer 4 hours agorootparentprevBucks are free, just print them. Wait, no, money are digital now, press a button and make money numbers. reply swalling 10 hours agoparentprev\"Portland did everything!

Everyone in the city, from the mayor [1] to the head of the largest services non-profit [2] has been yelling from the rooftops about the glacial slowness to effectively spend the allocated funding for drug treatment. Until just months ago, Multnomah County has been sitting on tens of millions of unspent funds,[3] and has been perpetually criticized for spending on harm reduction instead of treatment.[4] We actually closed the only local sobering center in 2020! 1. https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2023/03/20/wheeler-slams-mea... 2. https://www.wweek.com/news/2023/11/15/the-ceo-of-portlands-l... 3. https://katu.com/news/local/multnomah-county-chair-fast-trac... 4. https://www.kptv.com/2023/07/08/multnomah-county-implementin... reply Spinnaker_ 9 hours agorootparentRight, but the plan has still failed. If all the key players are on board and you can't even begin to implement the plan, then it was a bad plan, and the people who developed it had little comprehension of reality. We should not attempt this elsewhere. reply swalling 9 hours agorootparentNo, actually we should be trying to fix the stupid mistakes that were made in implementation of the plan, not roll it back and keep on fighting an equally moronic, ineffective, and racist War on Drugs elsewhere. The best available evidence is that decriminalization essentially had no effect on overdose deaths (https://www.opb.org/article/2023/10/03/ballot-measure-110-di...). It was going to go up no matter what because of the nature of fentanyl. The only thing the failure of Measure 110 has demonstrably done is waste taxpayer funds and give businesses in downtown an excuse for why they are failing (when in reality it has more to do with the death of downtown for purely economic reasons post-COVID, just like other major West Coast cities). reply uoaei 4 hours agorootparentThis is the classic approach of conservatives: throw wrenches in every part of a welfare system, then point to its failures to justify its dissolution. See: Medicare, public education, etc. reply oooyay 2 hours agorootparentI live in Portland. Conservatives do not have anything to do with our city or the county of Multnomah. We haven't elected a conservative since the 80s: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_McCready. We're the second highest taxed city in the nation. If you ask me most of our problems come down to fraud/waste/abuse, mismanagement, and dysfunction. reply achierius 4 hours agorootparentprevThe conservatives who run Portland and Oregon? reply uoaei 4 hours agorootparentYou will note of course that the rules and regulations around how to implement these things are always 'bipartisan' and meant to stir up as little backlash as possible. There's many opportunities to install bottlenecks and roadblocks in systems that end up shaping the entire way they function. To some extent it is progressives anticipating conservative backlash but there's plenty of lines in plenty of laws written into and insisted on by conservatives that have wide-ranging consequences. Reductionist perspectives on how politics works always end up at this \"one side is dominating the other\" kind of narrative but it's never actually that way, both sides still have a lot of influence on the various specifics of the outcome. reply yanderekko 4 hours agorootparentAre you seriously attributing public sector bureaucratic dysfunction to some sort of subversive public sector conservative operatives, or vague regulatory poison pills that you cannot actually point to here? It seems a lot more intuitive to believe that you cannot just legislate that all government employees act selflessly towards the Greater Good, and the Homeless Industrial complex is a real thing that is not necessarily working in the interests of the public. Observing waste, fraud, and abuse and reflexively saying \"this must be the fault of conservatives somehow\" is just sorta sad. reply halestock 5 hours agorootparentprevThere are a million reasons a plan like could fail that have nothing to do with with it being a good or bad plan, though. And there are a lot of people invested in making sure a plan like this fails, so that the people who supported it in the first place come to the same conclusion as you. reply lazyasciiart 5 hours agorootparentprev“They did everything except what would work!

And again, literally written into M110 is the idea that treatment is supposed to be cheaper than incarceration. Perhaps it's due to really bad red tape, but the treatment programs are not looking terribly cheap or effective. reply jdminhbg 11 hours agorootparent> Perhaps it's due to really bad red tape I don't think it's red tape as such, but rather that Portland suffers from a problem SF also has, which is that government social services are mostly run via the NGO-Industrial Complex.

If you have evidence that is not based on hearsay, please feel free to share, and we may respond accordingly.” That was really depressing to read.

Hard not to see it as a shadowy system of back-scratches and kickbacks between mayors' offices and the folks who run the NGOs.

The treatment programs implemented so far have been incredibly cheap, in the sense that we simply haven't spent any money on them. M110 has been more expensive than expected, because by not spending money on treatment programs, we caused an assortment of other issues. M110's effect on society is confounded by its coexistence with a statewide housing crisis that is pushing people into homelessness, and from there it's easy to fall into drug use. reply jrflowers 5 hours agorootparentprev> While this is true, there were a lot of programs that existed before M110 You make a good point. When we look at a program that hasn’t been implemented we must judge all other unrelated programs that were implemented to some degree or another at the same time. People might want to “see how it works out after implementation” while ignoring the necessity of “going back to the status quo that led to coming up the ideas on the first place” reply Consultant32452 11 hours agorootparentprevThere's two problems with these programs. The first problem is that the people we're really talking about, the ones living/defecating/etc on the street do not want help. The second problem is that in order to want to get better, an addict has to hit their personal rock bottom. Programs that keep people floating above their personal rock bottom are like family members enabling addicts. It ultimately doesn't help them. It's VERY difficult to create social programs that help people want to not be ill, while simultaneously not letting them fall to their own rock bottom. And then consider the position from the legislature of creating incentives for government programs/NGOs which align with the desired outcomes and it becomes expoentially harder. reply lazyasciiart 5 hours agorootparentThe 0th problem is that you’re actually completely wrong. reply uoaei 4 hours agorootparentprevDid you learn all these fantastic insights watching reality shows on TLC? reply InSteady 5 hours agorootparentprevPlenty of people on the streets want all kinds of help. They don't want shit programs with a million hoops and strings attached, nor do they want gross dilapidated shelters also with hoops and strings plus predators prowling around looking to steal their shit (or worse) while they sleep. Also, while the whole rock bottom trope probably holds some truth for many people, when you make every story all about it you kind of lose the plot. If you try hard enough, you can look at just about anyone's life who has recovered from addiction and create a narrative based on an upward trend after the \"worst\" moment or period of their addiction. If they had two periods that were basically exactly as bad, you dig around until you find some trivial reason to label the second period as worse, and thus the \"real bottom.\" If someone had their worst period of addiction many years before they actually got to a place where they could maintain sobriety long term it was just a long journey for them. Etc. reply hifreq 5 hours agorootparentYou are absolutely right. Plenty of people on the street want money and drugs for free with no strings attached. It's inhumane to deprive them of that. reply hifreq 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are many other examples of failed policies that increased financial pressure on taxpayers but did not result in an overall improvement in the homeless situation.

But I think the suffering of the individual is largely unchanged whether it happens out in public or on the periphery. In contrast, I think we as a larger society are suffering from lack of safe and clean public spaces. So we may as well maintain some sort of enforcement. reply CydeWeys 11 hours agorootparentThis is exactly the right call, and closer to the way we used to run things -- people acting a nuisance in the city weren't tolerated.

The rich and/or influential (that is, middle-/upper-class, but Americans aren't used to thinking that way) people who set policy for a city no longer live or even spend any time downtown. They push for the policies they think are right, but there's no feedback mechanism to tell them what effect they're actually having. reply bryan_w 4 hours agorootparentprevWell if an adult was found to be a nuisance and was unable to care for themselves, they would be put into the mental hospital. Unfortunately, due to some issues, those did not work out too well. reply ninth_ant 11 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that shelters have \"drama\" and \"rules\" is not a compelling reason for someone to make a home in an area that is intended for public use, and render it unusable and unsafe for others. Is this really a hard problem to solve? I can certainly buy the argument that criminalizing homelessness doesn't make sense when the \"criminal\" has no other options. But if someone has a viable option for not living on the street, I'm considerably less sympathetic given the downsides to everyone else involved. reply cortesoft 11 hours agorootparent> someone has a viable option for not living on the street I guess it depends on how we define viable. In my experience working with the homeless, there are a lot of valid reasons shelters are avoided; they can be more dangerous, don't allow pets (who are sometimes the only companions they have), and don't allow families or couples. Whether that is viable or not depends on how you use the word. reply plandis 10 hours agorootparentI really doubt homeless people are good pet owners.

In Portland \"housing first\" has been all the rage, but having lived with pretty severe addiction for some years, and spent lots of time around fellow addicts in considerably worse circumstances, it's pretty hard to imagine that a house on its own is some kind of solution. Especially when compared to a support network and high quality addiction treatment, medical care, and mental health services. In terms of sustainable recovery, the former is a luxury, while some combo of the latter are essential requirements. Of course, having all of them is by far the best.. man, addiction is a bitch. reply etchalon 4 hours agorootparent\"Housing first\" isn't the belief that providing a house \"on its own is some kind of solution\". It's the belief and practice of not refusing to provide housing support until people meet certain criteria – which is often how governments approach the problem. \"We only help those who help themselves\", etc. You get people a safe place to sleep and then provide them with resources to become re-integrated into society, not the other way around. reply notfed 9 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] recursive 7 hours agorootparentHow?

Free housing paid for by people like me, and ideally others, who are more than happy to take what I make and give it to people who need it more than I do. And you don’t need to be rich to do it.

No one wants to live in the same apartment complex as junkies. If you put them all together it turns into a crime filled cesspool. A hard drug addict is essentially toxic to any situation you drop them in. The solution is to forcibly treat them in rehab centers and then maybe follow up with free housing. This is followed up by drug testing for atleast a few years otherwise you lose your free housing.

Whatever housing you'd give them would very quickly turn into a slum.

But for the sake of fleshing it out, > I want to live for free too and not have to work and do drugs whenever I want. Here's the rub: When you get to the point of needing free housing, you are usually more or less already at the, shal we say, 'mature' phase of your addiction where there is hardly an ounce of joy left to be had from it. The daily grind of figuring out how to get high is basically just your hellish normal, and the best rush you might get here and there in your average month is akin to eating a nice meal, having a good (but not great) conversation, or a satisfying workout. Compared to good sex? Get out of here. That phase of drug use is long gone. If you want that back even for a fleeting moment you have to go through the hell of withdrawal first. Even doses that put you dangerously close to OD don't really reach that anymore unless you risk them after a period of abstinence (which is where most opiate addicts used to die, back before fentanyl was the norm). However, with all that said, I'd argue a functional addict is better equipped to deal with the stuff you mention above better than a severe addict who is trying to get sober after years of active addiction. Obviously acute withdrawal is an absolute bastard, but so are the following months of post acute withdrawal (aka your brain and body re-learning how to function at a completely new level of physiology). If we were doing it right, sobriety would be a hard requirement up front, followed by a good deal of support during the transition back into housing. True, it's much easier to get sober in stable housing. But you know what's even easier still? Continuing to use in a more comfortable and secure environment. Or worse yet, when free housing is still pretty scarce, using your pad as a commodity to score perks from your friends who are still homeless, or worse, using it as a safer and more secure place to stash and deal quantities of drugs to support your addiction directly. Anyone in active addiction will consider these possibilities the moment the lock is turned and they are alone in their new home (not all will act on it, of course). Housing yes, but probably not 'housing first.' You don't take a patient with a gunshot wound and make sure they have a long term care bed to lie in comfortably while they bleed. You get their ass to the ER and fix the bleed before worrying about the long term stuff. reply huytersd 5 hours agorootparentprevSolution is easy. If you’re visibly publicly intoxicated with hard drugs, you go to a special rehab that’s essentially prison without the violent criminals. If you’re already a violent criminal, you get put into a segregated area. You then get forcibly treated. If youv’e stayed clean for a set number of months, you get to leave. None of this shows up on any permanent/criminal record. reply janalsncm 4 hours agorootparentAgreed.

Portland is better housing-wise, but not by much. Considering how most people who are both homeless and on drugs were homeless first, then turned to drugs, I think this is a strong confounding factor.

A lot of the unhoused in Seattle are locals or in state, and many of the out of state are from neighboring states such as Idaho or other West Coast states. Rather I think the problem is that half assed decriminalization efforts simply aren’t enough and that drug overdose has become a much more severe issue because of the opioid epidemic and the proliferation of fentanyl. What needs to happen for decriminalization to work is much better social support for addicts, including safe use sites staffed with nurses, free health care for addicts including detox hospitalization and substance abuse treatments, social housing including housing specifically for recovering addicts and active addicts. In addition full legalization and regulated drug markets (preferably via pharmacies with a strict non-profit motive) wouldn’t hurt either. What Seattle has done is basically just decriminalization without any of the support needed to go with it.

Median sale price in Seattle is $560/square foot, which is almost exactly $6000/square meter. With minimum wage at $18.69/hr, that's 320 hours of minimum wage work per square meter. For comparison, average price per square meter in Paris is over 10 000 EUR ($10 700), whereas the minimum wage is 11.50 EUR, giving you a ratio of 870 hours of min wage work per square meter, almost 3 times more expensive. When you compare them by median household income, Seattle is around $110k/year, which is $55/hour, giving 110 hours/square meter for median family. In Paris, for comparison, median household income is 44k EUR/year, which is 22 EUR/hour, resulting in 454 hours/square meter, which is 4 times more expensive than in Seattle for median family, even worse than for minimum wage. These were before-tax figures, and doing after tax makes the situation even more lopsided: US tax system is much more progressive than European, and so taxes for median and below are extremely low compared to Europe. At Seattle minimum wage, the effective tax rate is around 15%, whereas in France, at minimum wage you're still paying 25% in income tax. To top it off, in France, the VAT is 20%, compared to 10% in Seattle.

This gives us 120 hours/square meter, which is comparable to Seattle. However, this becomes much worse if you look at after-tax situation. In Poland, at this pay range, your effective tax rate is 27%, whereas in Seattle it's 16%, and you have to then apply 23% VAT to your purchases, compared to 10% sales tax in Seattle. > As for income tax, at first glance, PWC disagrees: What specifically does it disagree about?

I have a close friend whose relative is a heroin addict. According to her, a lot of overdoses are due to almost no \"heroin\" actually being heroin, rather its fentanyl cut to varying degrees of strength. Not knowing what you're taking, and not knowing how strong it is, can lead to a lot of problems. If people knew what they were getting, and it was legal, you could have \"functional addicts\" that cause little or no societal harm. My friend's relative was a functional addict on and off for 20 years. She held down a job, paid rent, paid taxes, etc. She decided to get clean only when she had a close brush with death thanks to fentanyl. Think of it this way: My drug of choice is tequila. When I buy a bottle of 80 proof tequila, I buy it from a state licensed store. I have confidence that its 40% alcohol, and that its safe to drink. It is sold by a reputable company with a brand reputation. What we have today with illegal or \"decriminalized\" drugs is the equivalent of people dying from drinking bathtub gin during prohibition. reply noduerme 10 hours agoparent>> decriminalization is not enough; drugs need to be legalized and regulated. This has been an increasingly popular argument here in Portland since decriminalization. It's deployed, generally, in terms of re-criminalizing hard drugs until there's a well thought out framework for safe, regulated legalization. While I agree in principle [edit: let's say I did agree, but my views on this subject have shifted radically since I voted in favor of decriminalization - and I'll admit I was naive and wrong], I think that while decriminalization without regulation is clearly catastrophic, legalization with regulation would also not be desirable so long as it's confined to one local city, county or state, in the midst of a nationwide fentanyl crisis. Portland simply does not have the capacity or infrastructure to accept further waves of addicts from all over the country who come here to live on the street. Legalization means more regulatory burden, more services for out of town addicts paid by a dwindling local tax base that's quickly being displaced and/or opting to leave. To do that experiment and do it right, it needs to be nationwide. In any case, Portland can't go it alone anymore. And remember - we did have a long experiment with legally prescribed opioids, and their widespread availability contributed to the current addiction crisis. reply chmod600 9 hours agorootparent\"To do that experiment and do it right, it needs to be nationwide.\" I'm immediately skeptical of any idea where bad results become evidence that the idea should be deployed more widely. reply svnt 5 hours agorootparentThis happens all the time and is in practical use one of the best justifications for regulation. There must be a more specific term for it I’m forgetting, but it is essentially the tragedy of the commons.

Well yeah, when you have criminally-encouraged over prescription of highly addictive, fairly dangerous drugs, you’re going to create an addiction crisis, but the actual deaths happening now are due to the unavailability of those same prescription drugs. Before the prescription crackdown and fentanyl prevalence, some people who got addicted turned to heroin, and some of those people ODed, but now nearly every addicted individual only has access to fentanyl-laced street opiates. Methadone clinics are a decent example of how regulation helps this issue. reply drewg123 9 hours agorootparentprevI agree.

The attendant economic and social crisis then got worse as legal pills became less available.

Why does the issue seem to be most pronounced in Portland but not as significant in the rest of Oregon? What would be different if the experiment was done on a national scale? It seems to me that you would still see the worst impacts confined to a few major cities.

That is not what \"legalized\" means. It's still illegal to have opioids from anywhere other than your own prescription, which means that people without a prescription are basically on their own, have to get it through illegitimate means, and are all the way back to not knowing what they're getting. If I wanted a supply of, say, LSD, I am not going to accept a doctor telling me how much I can have, when and where I can have it (as in current legalized psilocybin clinics). I want to buy some from the store, take it home, and enjoy it in my own, safe environment, with friends and people I can trust. Is that so hard to ask? It's not like it's any less safe than stuff like alcohol or tobacco, in fact there isn't even any known LD50 yet. The only risk is things being sold as LSD that aren't actually, which is basically the same scenario as the current opioid crisis. reply cpncrunch 11 hours agoparentprevHeroin is very different from Tequila, so I don't think it's fair to compare them just because they are both \"drugs\".

And the people saying alcohol isn’t comparable should look at the stats - death from alcohol is a huge, but normalized and largely invisible issue. Legalizing will reduce violence, reduce accidental overdoses and poisonings, and give the state regular contact points with users (to hopefully funnel them to assistance). Safe use sites would go some way towards hiding the problem if managed well. Legalizing will not solve the problem of addiction. It will not solve overdoses (many overdoses are not caused by surprise differences in dose; people often overdose after relapse, or deliberately seek out stronger than usual supplies). We have to accept that legalizing will solve some problems, but will likely keep killing at least some people. Housing is another solution to hiding the problem. But housing just hides the drug use problem. It will probably also kill people - people who overdose on the sidewalk are more likely to be narcaned than people using alone. Free housing + free drugs for opiate addicts would go a long ways towards solving the issue for everyone who isn’t an opiate addict, and probably cheaper than imprisoning or healing addicts.

The second place firmly belongs to nicotine. It's way more addictive than. say, cocaine. Why not ban nicotine, by the same logic as heroin? The key difference is that nicotine is a mere stimulant, while heroin alters your perception, it literally changes the way you see good and bad, because it's the ultimate feel-good substance. I have zero qualms about legalizing LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, etc. Likely even cocaine. But legalization of opioids would require a lot of preliminary work, to somehow allow the addicts function in a socially compatible way when badly wanting a dose. It must be noted that a physiological addiction to opiates does not form from a first dose, and not even from the first ten doses, so infrequent recreational use is possible, given a right psychological preparation.

    "originBody": "Policy/ Tech/ Google Epic win: Jury decides Google has illegal monopoly in app store fight Epic win: Jury decides Google has illegal monopoly in app store fight / The jury decided Google’s sweetheart deals were too much. By Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. Updated Dec 12, 2023, 1:25 AM UTC| Share this story If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge Three years after Fortnite-maker Epic Games sued Apple and Google for allegedly running illegal app store monopolies, Epic has a win. The jury in Epic v. Google has just delivered its verdict — and it found that Google turned its Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly. After just a few hours of deliberation, the jury unanimously answered yes to every question put before them — that Google has monopoly power in the Android app distribution markets and in-app billing services markets, that Google did anticompetitive things in those markets, and that Epic was injured by that behavior. They decided Google has an illegal tie between its Google Play app store and its Google Play Billing payment services, too, and that its distribution agreement, Project Hug deals with game developers and deals with OEMs were all anticompetitive. Google affairs and public policy vp Wilson White said the company plans to appeal the verdict, and that “The trial made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles.” You can read theirfull statement further down. In a post on its company blog, Epic Games said, “Today’s verdict is a win for all app developers and consumers around the world. It proves that Google’s app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation.” It’s a historic victory, particularly because Epic mostly lost its fight against Apple two years ago when Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers decided that fight had nothing to do with apps. The future of Google’s app store is at stake in a lawsuit by Fortnite publisher Epic Games. Epic sued Google in 2020 after a fight over in-app purchase fees, claiming the Android operating system’s Google Play Store constituted an unlawful monopoly — while Google says its demands would damage Android’s ability to offer a secure user experience and compete with Apple. Here are the top 20 things we learned in the Epic v. Google trial. But Epic v. Google turned out to be a very different case. It hinged on secret revenue sharing deals between Google, smartphone makers, and big game developers, ones that Google execs internally believed were designed to keep rival app stores down. It showed that Google was running scared of Epic specifically. And it was all decided by a jury, unlike the Apple ruling. Mind you, we don’t know what Epic has actually won quite yet — that’s up to Judge James Donato, who’ll decide what the appropriate remedies might be. Epic never sued for monetary damages; it wants the court to tell Google that every app developer has total freedom to introduce its own app stores and its own billing systems on Android, and we don’t yet know how or even whether the judge might grant those wishes. Both parties will meet with Judge Donato in the second week of January to discuss potential remedies. Judge Donato has already stated that he will not grant Epic’s additional request for an anti-circumvention provision “just to be sure Google can’t reintroduce the same problems through some alternative creative solution,” as Epic lead attorney Gary Bornstein put it on November 28th. “We don’t do don’t-break-the-law injunctions... if you have a problem, you can come back,” Donato said. He also said he did not intend to decide what percentage fee Google should charge for its products. Although Epic didn’t sue for damages, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney suggested Epic stood to make hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars if it doesn’t have to pay Google’s fee. Here’s the completed verdict form that jurors had to fill out in Epic v. Google: Wilson White, Google VP, Government Affairs & Public Policy: We plan to challenge the verdict. Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform. The trial made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles. We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem.” Update December 11th, 8:45PM ET: Added statements from both Google and Epic Games as well as final jury verdict.

    "title": "GigaGPT: Training GPT-2 Sized Models with Cerebras Hardware",
    "originLink": "https://www.cerebras.net/blog/introducing-gigagpt-gpt-3-sized-models-in-565-lines-of-code",
    "originBody": "GigaGPT is Cerebras’ implementation of Andrei Karpathy’s nanoGPT – the simplest and most compact code base to train and fine-tune GPT models. Whereas nanoGPT can train models in the 100M parameter range, gigaGPT trains models well over 100B parameters. We do this without introducing additional code or relying on third party frameworks – the entire repo is just 565 lines of code. Instead gigaGPT utilizes the large memory and compute capacity of Cerebras hardware to enable large scale training on vanilla torch.nn code. With no modifications, gigaGPT supports long context lengths and works with a variety of optimizers. Why gigaGPT While the transformer architecture is simple, training a large transformer on a large number of GPUs is hard. Beyond a few billion parameters, vanilla GPT models run out of memory on even the latest GPUs. Training larger models requires breaking up models into smaller pieces, distributing them to multiple GPUs, coordinating the workload among the workers, and assembling the results. This is typically done via LLM scaling frameworks such as Megatron, DeepSpeed, NeoX, Fairscale, and Mosaic Foundry. Though powerful, these frameworks introduce significant complexity. A small model such as nanoGPT requires just 639 lines of code to implement. To implement a 20B parameter model using Nvidia Megatron model requires 20,507 lines of code – a 32x increase in complexity. Even though this code doesn’t need to be written from scratch, implementing, debugging, and maintaining such a project is a major undertaking. Many ML teams struggle to get these frameworks to work and few manage to converge models with decent utilization. gigaGPT shows that on Cerebras hardware you can have the best of both worlds – a compact, hackable codebase and the ability to train GPT-3 sized models with long context. The Models gigaGPT implements the basic GPT-2 architecture in a way that matches nanoGPT. In particular, we use learned position embeddings, standard attention, and biases throughout the model. These choices were made primarily to stick closely to nanoGPT and can easily be changed. We validate gigaGPT by training four models with 111M, 13B, 70B, and 175B parameters. All the models tested use the OpenWebText dataset using the GPT-2 tokenizer with preprocessing code taken from nanoGPT. As the goal of this project was to create a clean, performant, and usable code base for others to use rather than to train state of the art models ourselves, our validation was geared towards functional correctness rather than convergence, downstream performance, or other similar metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only GPT model that scales from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters without specialized parallelization techniques. gigaGPT-111M The 111M config was inspired by Cerebras-GPT. It uses the same model dimensions, learning rate, batch size, and training schedule and differ from Cerebras-GPT primarily in their dataset. The loss trend looks good and roughly matches what we observed for the corresponding Cerebras-GPT configuration despite the different choice of dataset. While we were writing gigaGPT, we performed thorough side-by-side numerical checks against a trusted reference code base, so seeing this loss trend isn’t surprising, but it’s always nice to get the confirmation of a converged model. As with the 111M configuration, the 13B configuration also closely matches the model of that size from Cerebras-GPT in model dimensions, learning rate, batch size, and training schedule. Over the first hundred steps we see a few minor loss spikes, but nothing the model can’t recover from. A 13B model training run takes a substantial amount of compute so we stop after about 100 training steps. At this point we’re well past the scale that nanoGPT can accommodate, but gigaGPT handles it without a problem. The 70B configuration is loosely inspired by Llama-2 70B. It takes its model dimensions and from that work and trains for the same 2T parameters as Llama-2 70B with a similar batch size. The learning rate used is slightly more conservative, as previous groups have noticed more instabilities when using learned position embeddings compared to RoPE . Since our goal wasn’t to converge the model, we didn’t perform rigorous hyperparameter selection. Even so, loss appears to be decreasingly steadily and training is fairly stable. At 70B gigaGPT continues to show great performance and scaling. Even though we grew the model size by two orders of magnitude, and made no effort to optimize for throughput, utilization remains equal or better than previous runs; we just wrote it, ran it, and immediately saw fast results. This model code is also trivial to scale out despite having been written as a single monolithic model – gigaGPT-70B works from 1 to 64 systems such as the Condor Galaxy 1 by just editing a single flag in the configuration file. gigaGPT-175B After validating the 70B model, we were curious to further probe the limits of model scale that gigaGPT could accommodate. We changed the model dimensions of the 70B config to match what was reported in the original GPT-3 paper, scaled the learning rate and initialization using common heuristics, and launched a run. The few steps we trained weren’t of much interest from a convergence perspective, but the model ran without any issues at the same utilization as the 70B model. What’s most notable here for ML practitioners is that going large does not cause Cerebras hardware to run out of memory. Based on the results we believe gigaGPT can scale to models in excess of 1 trillion parameters. How gigaGPT Works The gigaGPT model does not use any sharding or pipelining techniques because it fits entirely into the system memory of Cerebras hardware. To briefly recap: Cerebras Wafer Scale Clusters are comprised of 1 to 192 Cerebras CS-2 systems supported by accompanying CPU server nodes that store parameters (MemoryX), data and an interconnect (SwarmX). Unlike GPU based clusters, compute and memory are de-coupled. The entire model – upward of trillions of parameters – is stored in a dedicated MemoryX appliance. The model weights are streamed to the wafer one layer at a time during training. By storing models in large, unified memory systems, we obviate the need to break models apart using complex frameworks. All model training from 1 to 192 systems is done using standard mini batches aka data parallelism. gigaGPT is comprised mainly of model.py and train.py. Looking more closely at the model code, we see that it looks quite similar to concise GPT implementations written for GPUs. It is built from `torch.nn` components without use of any fancy external libraries like xFormers or DeepSpeed. In fact, the model code is quite boring. Compared to nanoGPT, we rewrote the attention layer to use primitive torch ops instead of fused attention algorithms and to expose the attention mask as an argument to the attention layer to increase flexibility. Other than that, the differences compared to nanoGPT are mainly cosmetic. Likewise, the main training loop is also very simple. It utilizes `cerebras_pytorch` (a custom PyTorch wrapper specialized for CS System execution) as a drop-in replacement for calls to standard torch APIs. There are only a couple of parts of this file that will look new to someone who is already familiar with PyTorch, in particular the use of a few decorators to section off different sections of functionality as well as the use of a `cerebras_pytorch.backend` scope for model creation. Overall the code is easy to understand, familiar looking to PyTorch users, and easy to modify and customize. Training a large model across a huge cluster requires careful orchestration of multiple independent jobs running across heterogeneous hardware, on its face a very daunting challenge. The `cerebras_pytorch` package is the solution to this problem and is the crux of what allows the gigaGPT code to be so simple. `cerebras_pytorch` wraps some PyTorch functionality that users will already be familiar with and adds a small number of new APIs that help simplify the distributed computing needs of the problem. In this section we will walk through the code of gigaGPT’s `train.py` to better illuminate these APIs. We’ll start with the end of the `main` function which contains the high-level logic for the training loop and work backwards through the definitions of each of the components it uses. for step, batch in enumerate(executor, start=global_step + 1): if step > config.num_steps: break loss = training_step(batch) log_loss(loss, step) save_checkpoint(step) This is a simple starting point, so we don’t need to spend too much time here. Let’s first take a closer look at the `executor` used above. dataloader = cstorch.utils.data.DataLoader( get_dataloader, data_path, config.sequence_length, config.batch_size, config.seed, ) executor = cstorch.utils.data.DataExecutor( dataloader, num_steps=config.num_steps - global_step, checkpoint_steps=config.checkpoint_steps, cs_config=cs_config, writer=writer, ) For Cerebras system runs, there are dedicated CPU nodes that handle loading data and feeding it into the model. `cstorch.utils.data.DataLoader` handles the job of defining the dataloader instance that will run on each of these worker nodes. It takes a function that returns a dataloader instance for ease of setting up independent properly sharded dataloaders on each worker node. This `cstorch.utils.data.DataLoader` object is then fed into a `DataExecutor`, which is responsible for the top-level coordination of all the different independent tasks required for the run. Next, let’s look more closely at the components involved in defining a single training step. Internally, `cerebras_pytorch` uses PyTorch LTC to trace the compute graph associated with the training job and maps this compute graph down to operations that can be run on the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE). Accordingly, the first step towards defining the training logic is to create the model instance in a way that enables it to be traced later. This is accomplished by the following code at the top of `train.py::main`: backend = cstorch.backend(config.backend, use_cs_grad_accum=True) … with backend.device: model = GPTModel(model_config) compiled_model = cstorch.compile(model, backend) With this model definition along with an optimizer and learning rate scheduler that are created with APIs that directly mirror PyTorch APIs, we are now ready to define the logic of a basic training step. @cstorch.trace def training_step(batch): input_ids, labels = batch loss = compiled_model(input_ids, labels) loss.backward() torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(list(all_params), config.max_gradient_norm) optimizer.step() lr_scheduler.step() optimizer.zero_grad() return loss The body of this function is fairly standard training code. The only interesting part is the `@cstorch.trace` decorator. This signals to the framework that the code in the function is intended to be traced and run on CS system. No tensors can be eagerly executed within this scope, which means the code in here can’t include any logging functionality or python conditionals. For that, we need a different decorator: @cstorch.step_closure def log_loss(loss, step): rate = executor.profiler.rate() global_rate = executor.profiler.global_rate() logger.info( f\"| Step={step}, \" f\"Loss={loss.item():.5f}, \" f\"Rate={rate:.2f} samples/sec, \" f\"GlobalRate={global_rate:.2f} samples/sec\" ) writer.add_scalar(\"loss\", loss.item(), step) writer.add_scalar(\"samples_per_second\", global_rate, step) This logging code requires eagerly executing tensor values and doesn’t need to run on the WSE, so we wrap it in a `@cstorch.step_closure` decorator. Checkpointing code works similarly, except that we want to make sure that it only runs every `checkpoint_steps` steps for whatever value of `checkpoint_steps` we pass into the `DataExecutor` above. For this we have the `@cstorch.checkpoint_closure` decorator. Functions wrapped in this decorator can be called at any time but will only execute if the current step is a checkpoint step. @cstorch.checkpoint_closure def save_checkpoint(step): checkpoint_path = out_dir.joinpath(f\"checkpoint_{step}.mdl\") state_dict = { \"model\": model.state_dict(), \"optimizer\": optimizer.state_dict(), \"lr_scheduler\": lr_scheduler.state_dict(), \"global_step\": step, \"model_config\": asdict(model_config), } cstorch.save(state_dict, checkpoint_path) logger.info(f\"Saved checkpoint to {checkpoint_path}\") With that, we’re done defining the functions we used in the main training loop we started with. After a couple of lines of code to fill in the gaps of checkpoint loading, config handling, etc, we end up with a `train.py` which in just 156 lines of code is able to seamlessly coordinate training jobs across huge distributed clusters. Conclusion We’d like to thank Andrei Karpathy for creating nanoGPT and inspiring this work. We believe simple, hackable, and performant code is essential for advancing machine learning research. By combining the benefits of a compact code base and the ability to train GPT-3 scale models, gigaGPT on Cerebras hardware represents a significant leap towards more accessible, scalable, and efficient AI model training. If you’re working with the Cerebras platform, we encourage you to experiment with gigaGPT and share your feedback.

They achieve this small LOC count because they don&#x27;t need to shard across multiple devices &#x2F; backprop consolidate on a central CPU &#x2F; etc. These tricks are usually what blows up a project from a single architecture proof of concept to a robust training pipeline that can handle the billions of parameters on modern models. This is more akin to training a whole model on a single GPU because... it kind of is.Even with a wafer scale chipset this approach has limits. You eventually will still need to shard to fit more parameters &#x2F; use different training modalities &#x2F; etc. I&#x27;d look at this more as a proof of concept for the ergonomics of what LLM training can look like when you have access to a much larger compute primitive versus a new state of the art in feature-equivalent clean code.Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a small investor in Cerebras. reply TeMPOraL 16 hours agoparentThis does however feel a bit like that \"big data\" phenomenon, where most companies deploy ridiculously overcomplicated distributed data clusters, where their actual problems could be handled much more simply, cheaply and efficiently, by a single server with a lots of RAM and a solution somewhere on the spectrum between \"bunch of UNIX pipes with standard UNIX text processing tools\" and \"tuned PostgreSQL\" &#x2F; \"tuned in-memory SQLite\".That is: a lot of distributed big data processing tasks don&#x27;t need to be distributed. Perhaps with beefy enough matrix multiplication chips, a lot of \"big ML\" tasks won&#x27;t need to be distributed either. reply icyfox 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m a big believer in the approach you&#x27;re laying out too. Bugs are much easier to diagnose, crash reporting is more straightforward, and you don&#x27;t need augmented services to consolidate everything at the output layer. That said - I&#x27;ve been predicting a shift back to simple architectures for awhile now and they haven&#x27;t really come to pass. Maybe there&#x27;s too much pressure or financial incentives for increasing complexity to solve increasing complexity?At the end of the day I do believe ergonomics are going to win out. I think that&#x27;s in large part why pytorch won out over tensorflow and jax; it provided the just-in-time computation that would allow people to more easily find bugs & visualize results without having to `compile()` everything down to a static computation graph. Hardware seems like a natural place for that abstraction layer - but maybe the silver bullet will really be on the software side, since we already have too many \"low-RAM\" equivalent ML devices in the wild. Cheaper to string things together after the fact vs. shipping net new hardware. reply cs702 15 hours agorootparentThe other thing to keep in mind is that Transformers may well be end up being supplanted by more efficient alternatives with different hardware requirements.For instance, right now there&#x27;s a new crop of \"linear RNNs\" (RWKV, Mamba, retnet, etc.) claiming to be as good as Transformers for language modeling but with two advantages: their compute cost is O(n) instead of O(n²), and they don&#x27;t need to keep past context in memory.I don&#x27;t know if these linear RNNs will actually supplant Transformers, but I do think hardware requirements are likely to change over time. reply happytiger 15 hours agorootparentprevWhich architecture more closely resembles the human brain? reply esafak 14 hours agorootparentSpiking neural networks, I think. reply Voloskaya 10 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a totally fair comparison.We don&#x27;t have overcomplicated distributed training infra. They are pretty much as complicated as needed.Scaling vertically (having a bigger chip) is very hard. There are tons of tradeoff when making the chip, and it&#x27;s overall an insanely complex problem. That&#x27;s why Cerebras is a 8 years old company and yet you would be hard pressed to find anyone using them still.And even if you give me a Cerebras chip that works perfectly, it will still be much easier for me to buy two of those chips and link them together in distributed training mode, than it will be for Cerebras to build a chip that is 2x the size.The scale of the current generation of clusters to train models the size of GPT-4 are in the range of 25,000+ GPUs with 80GB of memory each, so no matter your chip size, complicated distributed infra is a necessity. Even assuming everything on Cerebras&#x27; marketing page is fully accurate, you would still need to distribute the training over 500+ of those massive chips to replicate a 25k GPU cluster. reply kristjansson 16 hours agorootparentprevYou can hide a whole lot of essential complexity in a hardware layer.However, the very next question a researcher will ask once a model fits on one device is “can I make it twice as fast&#x2F;big if I use two?” reply TeMPOraL 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d think that such researcher would&#x27;ve already heard of adages like \"you can&#x27;t get nine women to give birth in one month\", or \"where there&#x27;s six cooks, there&#x27;s nothing to eat\".Or more directly, perhaps one should ask such researcher, \"if your team was to double in head count, would you do this project twice as fast?\". reply kristjansson 15 hours agorootparent8 GPUs do a pretty bang-up job of doing 8 months of compute in a month :).I think the broader point is that the last x0 years of ML research show that more compute is better, both for iteration speed and for resulting performance. Distribution is just the natural outgrowth of that imperative once it reaches the limit of a single device&#x2F;node. If Cerebras can address models at today&#x27;s scale on one device, the immediate next step is \"what can N of these devices do together to build models at tomorrow&#x27;s scale\"[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cerebras.net&#x2F;condor-galaxy-1 reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agorootparentFair enough :).I still think work on improving single-core&#x2F;device performance is worthwhile, as distribution will always strictly not-better, and almost always strictly worse, due to coordination costs reducing efficiency. If two Cerberas can be glued together and achieve roughly 2x of their performance, it&#x27;s still going to be more efficient than achieving equivalent performance from many more regular GPUs. Getting the hardware fast enough so that you need just one device for your problem - that&#x27;s a special case that will yield extra win. reply andy99 16 hours agorootparentprev> Or more directly, perhaps one should ask such researcher, \"if your team was to double in head count, would you do this project twice as fast?\".If everybody&#x27;s job was just to do dot products all day I&#x27;d hope the answer would be yes. reply mejutoco 16 hours agorootparentWhich dot products did you do, I&#x27;ll do the next one.

Surely they did one during development, and surely the Sales team knows (or they do once the article was published), yet not even a hint of what their throughput is like.

GPT-5 might be another case of simply scaling up the existing transformer models, but the next step-function change of model quality are going to involve a lot more R&D about the right architectural primitives to take before scaling it up. And in that case lines of code do matter - because they allow simple concepts to be robustly tested, optimized, and iterated against. Doing that against a 50k monolith is a much harder task. reply Voloskaya 12 hours agoprevDistributed training infra&#x2F;libs have made insane progress since the Megatron era. I have worked with Megatron codebase to train larger than 175B models a few years back, a lot of the boilerplate that you find in those 20k LoC you could remove today by just importing deepspeed or other distributed training libs.Cerebras&#x27; point still stands though, even if you can get the LoC count down significantly nowadays, it&#x27;s still a major PITA to debug those systems, deal with node crashing, tweak the architecture and the data-loading pipeline to have high GPU utilization, optimize network bottlenecks etc. Scaling vertically first like Cerebras is doing surely makes that much easier.On a tangentially related note, this is imho where OpenAI has built it&#x27;s moat: training and inference stack that they have refined over the last 6 years. They have good researchers, but so does MS, Google and Meta. But no one else has the ability to train such large models with such ease. Same for the inference stack, being able to run GPT-3.5&#x2F;4 in prod at the scale at which they are doing it is no joke, and I&#x27;m 100% convinced this is why Gemini is still not widely available a year after 3.5 came out. reply filterfiber 15 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re comparing the parameter sizes to lines of code.AFAIK you can just increase the layer parameters of a 1B model to whatever you want? Like, the difference between a 1B and 175B model can be just changing a few numbers, and not adding any LOC at all?LOC has never been a limitation for large models, it&#x27;s been the compute+training data required.Most of the LOC is spent on optimization, and they don&#x27;t address MoE or anything fancy like that? reply jwan584 15 hours agoparentwhen you go from 1B to 175B, the model no longer fits in memory. so in practice you have to re-factor the model using tensor&#x2F;pipeline parallelism. that&#x27;s why it goes from 600 to 20K LOC. reply nerpderp82 15 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t look like Cerebras mentioned the most important part, by trading model complexity due to using a vastly more capable system, they could could refactor that 600 line model effortlessly and rerun.They can watch different layers train and find out how to optimize training or quantization, etc.It feels like they kinda missed the forest for the trees here.

Both accelerate, deepspeed and other improvements are available and the ecosystem is vibrant. One thing you might want to look into is to write your own training loop rather than using Autotrainer, but that&#x27;s if you want to get you hands dirty and get finer control over how you call layers, your loss function etc.Inference is where it falls short really, and solutions like vLLM are much much faster. reply jackblemming 16 hours agorootparentprevStay far away from HuggingFace if you can.

I do agree that going beyond the documentation demos does make things more complicated, but IMO still less so than other implementations speaking from experience. AI is still sometimes necessarily complex.It&#x27;s certainly an order of magnitude easier to use something like transformers or diffusers than the original implementations provided by the original model trainers, and has a few good optimizations out of the box.That&#x27;s different from LangChain which is complex for the sake of being complex. reply b4ckup 16 hours agorootparentprevGood to hear that I&#x27;m not the only one thinking that.

And, the result is that, by writing 565 LoC yourself, you can train and run an LLM the size of GPT-3.In that sense, 565 LoC is a perfectly fair number. It doesn&#x27;t count PyTorch, numpy, the Python interpreter, or any of the library modules that are imported, but I don&#x27;t think anyone was touting it as anything more; for instance, Mo Gawdat has said that GPT-4 is probably ~4500 LoC.

    "originBody": "Opinion December 8, 2023 6 min read Bad Science and Bad Statistics in the Courtroom Convict Innocent People Science, statistics and expert testimony are crucial in securing justice. But their dubious applications in the courtroom can send innocent people to jail By David Robert Grimes Credit: wildpixel/Getty Images Statistics The city of New York recently witnessed a record payout to George Bell, falsely convicted of murder in 1999, after it emerged prosecutors had deliberately hidden evidence casting doubt on his guilt, giving false statements in court. Bell is the latest in a long line of people, especially Black Americans, unfoundedly convicted. More recently, Jabar Walker and Wayne Gardine were cleared after decades in prison. Conviction integrity units across North America have found serious flaws with many long-standing convictions. Alarmingly for scientists, misleading forensic and expert evidence is too often a deciding factor in such miscarriages of justice; of the 233 exonerations in 2022 alone recorded by the National Registry of Exonerations, deceptive forensic evidence and expert testimony was a factor in 44 of them. In an era of high-tech forensics, the persistence of such brazen miscarriages of justice is more than unsettling. The National Institute of Justice, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, has just published a report that found certain techniques, including footprint analysis and fire debris, in forensic science were disproportionately associated with wrongful conviction. The same report found expert testimony that “reported forensic science results in an erroneous manner” or “mischaracterized statistical weight or probability” was often the driving force in false convictions. The disconcerting reality is that illusions of scientific legitimacy and flawed expert testimony are often the catalyst for deeply unsound convictions. This paradox arises because scientific evidence is highly valued by juries, which often lack the expertise to correctly interpret or question it. Juries with a lower understanding of the potential limitations of such evidence are more likely to convict without questioning the evidence or its context. This is exacerbated by undue trust in expert witnesses, who may overstate evidence or underplay uncertainty. As a 2016 presidential advisors report warned, “expert witnesses have often overstated the probative value of their evidence, going far beyond what the relevant science can justify.” The debacle of British pediatrician Roy Meadow serves as a powerful exemplar of precisely this. Famed for his influential “Meadow’s law,” which asserted that one sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious, and three is murder until proved otherwise, Meadow was a frequent expert witness in trials in the United Kingdom. His penchant for seeing sinister patterns, however, stemmed not from real insight, but from terrible statistical ineptitude. In the late 1990s, Sally Clark suffered a double tragedy, losing two infant sons to sudden infant death syndrome. Despite scant evidence of anything beyond misfortune, Clark was tried for murder, with Meadows testifying to her guilt. In court, Meadow testified that families like the Clarks had a one-in-8,543 chance of a sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) case. Thus, he asserted, the probability of two cases in one family was this squared, roughly one-in-73 million of two deaths arising by chance alone. In a rhetorical flourish, he likened it to successfully backing an 80-to-1 outsider to win the Grand National horse race over four successive years. This seemingly unimpeachable, damning statistic figure convinced both jury and public of her guilt. Clark was demonized in the press and imprisoned for murder. Yet this verdict horrified statisticians, for several reasons. To arrive at his figure, Meadow simply multiplied probabilities together. This is perfectly correct for truly independent events like roulette wheels or coin-flips, but fails horribly when this assumption is not met. By the late 1990s, there was overwhelming epidemiological evidence that SIDS ran in families, rendering assumptions of independence untenable. More subtle but as damaging was a trick of perception. To many, this appeared equivalent to a one-in-73-million chance Clark was innocent. While this implication was intended by the prosecution, such an inference was a statistical error so ubiquitous in courtrooms it has a fitting moniker: the prosecutor’s fallacy. This variant of the base-rate fallacy arises because while multiple cases of SIDS are rare, so too are multiple maternal infanticides. To determine which situation is more likely, the relative likelihood of these two competing explanations must be compared. In Clark’s case, this analysis would have shown that the probability of two SIDS deaths vastly exceeded the infant murder hypothesis. The Royal Statistical Society issued a damning indictment of Meadow’s testimony, echoed by a paper in the British Medical Journal. But such rebukes did not save Clark from years in jail. After a long campaign, Clark’s verdict was overturned in 2003, and several other women convicted by Meadow’s testimony were subsequently exonerated. The General Medical Council found Meadow guilty of professional misconduct and barred him from practicing medicine. But Clark’s vindication was no consolation for the heartbreak she had suffered, and she died an alcohol-related death in 2007. The prosecutor’s fallacy emerges constantly in problems of conditional probability, leading us sirenlike towards precisely the wrong conclusions—and undetected, sends innocent people to jail. Earlier this year, Australia pardoned Kathleen Folbigg after 20 years in jail after a conviction for murdering her four children in 2003 based on Meadow’s discredited law. Dutch nurse Lucia de Berk was convicted of seven murders of patients in 2004, based on ostensible statistical evidence. While convincing to a jury, it also appalled statistical experts, who lobbied for a reopening of the case. Again, the case against de Berk pivoted entirely on the prosecutor’s fallacy, and her conviction was overturned in 2010. This isn’t just historical occurrence. The veneer of science and expert opinion has such an aura of authority that when invoked in open court, it is rarely challenged. Even effective techniques like blood splatter and DNA analysis can be misused in unsound convictions, underpinned by variants of the prosecutor’s fallacy. A suspect’s rare blood type (5 percent) matching traces at a scene, for example, does not imply that guilt is 95 percent certain. A hypothetical town of 2,000 potential suspects has 100 people matching that criterion, which renders the probability that the suspect is guilty in the absence of other evidence at just 1 percent. Worse is when the science cited is so dubious as to be useless. One recent analysis found only about 40 percent of psychological measures cited in courts have strong evidentiary background, and yet they are rarely challenged. Entire techniques like bite-mark analysis have been shown to be effectively useless despite convictions still turning on them. Polygraph tests are so utterly inaccurate as to be deemed inadmissible by courts, and yet remain perversely popular with swathes of American law enforcement. This can and does ruin lives. Hair analysis, dismissed by forensics experts worldwide as pseudoscientific, was embraced by the FBI for its ability to get convictions. But this hollow theater of science condemned innocent people, disproportionately affecting people of color like Kirk Odom, who languished in prison for 22 years for a rape he did not commit. Odom was but one victim of this illusory science; a 2015 report found hundreds of cases in which hair examiners made erroneous statements in inculpating defendants, including 33 cases that sent defendants to death row, nine of whom were already executed by the time the report saw daylight. As noted by ProPublica, the use of “lung float” tests to supposedly differentiate between stillbirth and murder is being challenged by experts. Despite the fact the test is highly fallible, it has already been used to justify imprisoning women who lost children for murder, raising alarm over yet another potential manifestation of the prosecutor’s fallacy. While science and statistics are crucial in the pursuit of justice, their uncertainties and weaknesses must be as clearly communicated as strengths. Evidence and statistics demand context, lest they mislead rather than enlighten. Juries and Judges need to be educated on standards of scientific and statistical evidence, and to understand what to demand of expert testimony, before courts send people to prison. Without improved scientific and statistical integrity in courtrooms, the risk of convicting innocent people can neither be circumvented nor ignored.

Criminal courts really, really aren&#x27;t a good place to address technical matters. For example, ankle electronic monitoring (obviously) doesn&#x27;t work well in faraday-cage like apartment complexes. And yet time and time again, GPS skew is used to argue that someone left their home -- sometimes even months after the fact. I&#x27;ve read emails from a local sheriff&#x27;s office that said that they consider a sufficiently weak signal to be a result of \"foiling\", period. Through FOIA though, I&#x27;ve been able to get over 100 million instances where a GPS device didn&#x27;t have a strong enough signal. There are even criminal trials where an EM company will send a sales person to testify and to claim that they&#x27;re not aware of any technical faults with the system.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thetriibe.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;many-on-house-arrest-in-cook-c...

What the fuck is the point of these programs? I can understand wanting to use EM to ensure someone shows up to a trial, but this geofencing stuff is absolute madness.

If I hadn&#x27;t gone through a similar situation I would almost believe that you were making it up, that&#x27;s how ridiculous this is.For context I got stopped in a car with a friend who had weed (unknown to me at the time), had a really old warrant for something like a missed child support payment (also didn&#x27;t know), and we were both removed from the car. Mind you, I was not driving, and the car did not belong to me, I was simply a passenger. Cops claim they have cause to search the car, I can&#x27;t argue otherwise, car gets searched, weed was found, we both get hit with the charge.I was expected to pay $6000 for possession, spent a week in jail, lost my job, and had to travel 3 hours to the court house to \"appear\" in front of a judge with no means of getting there because every waking moment needed me to find a job and save any money I had to pay upcoming rent and needs, in addition to paying child support and not missing a payment otherwise I would end up in jail.That&#x27;s how quickly this shit escalates, had I not found a ride to get to the court house at least twice, I would&#x27;ve been arrested for bail jumping, and lost my new job, and my apartment.Apologizes if I&#x27;m taking away from your experience, not my intention.

Your situation is (sadly) very common indeed.And as you say, if you start missing child support payments the judge will hit you with contempt charges and put you straight back in jail for several months to teach you a lesson.If you had ended up in jail the case might have run on for months or years. Once you are inside a jail you lose most contact with your attorney and your support system and you have the lowest priority in the system, so your case is usually just continued each month until the end of time.Find the wrong cops and you&#x27;ll end up in jail for months for having some vitamins on you:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;Blzbm reply RetpolineDrama 14 hours agorootparent>And as you say, if you start missing child support payments the judge will hit you with contempt charges and put you straight back in jail for several months to teach you a lesson.All of this should be illegal, debtors prisons by another name is all this is. reply nerdponx 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s particularly irrational because they&#x27;re the ones that put you in the situation of missing child support in the first place. Seems more like extortion and racketeering to me. reply pc86 15 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, the common refrain in scenarios like this is that it&#x27;s your fault. Even ignoring the weed, which I think a lot of people would have sympathy for, you owed child support that wasn&#x27;t paid and had a [bench, presumably] warrant out for your arrest. The simple fact of the matter is that most people don&#x27;t owe court-mandated child support at any point in their lives, most people that do owe it pay it, and most people don&#x27;t ever have warrants out for their arrest.I don&#x27;t say this as any sort of moral or character judgment, but simply to point out that part of the reason this thing is allowed to happen is because the people it&#x27;s happening to are very rarely sympathetic individuals. They&#x27;re viewed as bad people and \"others\" by the majority of the population.So what&#x27;s the fix for this? I wish I had an answer, but I don&#x27;t. Maybe teaching empathy so that the court system starts feeling pressure from the citizens that this isn&#x27;t ok. Maybe legislation against charge stacking just to elicit plea deals. There&#x27;s also the very real possibility of the pendulum swinging too far in the other direction where DAs don&#x27;t charge petty crime and people charged with violent crimes are released on signature bonds. reply chaps 15 hours agorootparent\"Teaching empathy\" won&#x27;t do a thing and&#x27;ll just be mocked and memed. We need to start at a lower fundamental.An easy first step would be to increase accessibility to court documents so that journalists and researchers have better means of researching these complex problems. In Illinois for example, the judicial branch is exempt from FOIA. This effectively manifests itself as an informal allowance of judges&#x2F;prosecutors to get away with a lot of systemic injustices. They get away with it because the means of identifying these systemic problems is through data and records that exist beyond a moat. One existing alternative to FOIA here is the county clerk&#x27;s in-person system.. but the system times out on half of its searches, is missing tons of docs, painfully slow, etc. Another existing path is through a FOIA to the State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s office, but they&#x27;re notoriously slow and I&#x27;m amongst the handful of others who are suing for non-responsiveness. A lot of this is made worse by the State&#x27;s Attorney hashing person and case identifiers to make it effectively impossible to understand how someone&#x27;s case progressed through the courts, starting from the arrest. reply k2enemy 15 hours agorootparentprevI think you misread the parent.

Child support agencies are immediately notified if you&#x27;ve been let go and will hound you on a daily basis to find employment, there are no breaks.Thankfully I&#x27;m in a much better position in life, but I know what it&#x27;s like if you don&#x27;t have access to capital to hire a good defense attorney who isn&#x27;t behind the 8-ball like public defenders always find themselves. reply pc86 15 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re right!

Entirely my friend&#x27;s position, not mine.I think it&#x27;s important to point out that our justice system is so overburdened with cases they have to take deals, and that&#x27;s just for the side of the system where folks don&#x27;t have access to capital to hire good attorneys, they get stuck with the even more overburdened public defenders, who don&#x27;t eve have time to review any of the details of the charge.Then there&#x27;s the other side that is well off and can fight their charge with a great attorney, or a team of lawyers, at which point the county&#x2F;state decides it&#x27;s not worth the hassle to tie up their DA on this particular case and they provide the defense with an agreeable plea (usually a slap on the wrist to get it wrapped up quick), then proceed with the next one.As as most faculties in our society, the issue is and always has been an issue of resources.

I could hardly believe my eyes when the person responsible for the accuracy of the method was quoted as saying that it was very reliable, because it used two unreliable methods to estimate if the person was above 18 years old, and then concluded that they were 18+ if either method so indicated. You don’t need to be a genius to realize your false 18+ rate will be higher when combining two methods in this way than it would be if you used a single method, but he argued the opposite.This caught my attention and I spent an inordinate amount of time, together with a group of other concerned people, trying to convince this government authority they were wrong, and later to expose them for it &#x2F; stop them from continuing. But it sadly turned out to be next to impossible. They persisted with inaccurate&#x2F;false affidavits and court testimony for years, until finally the minister of justice ordered a formal probe into the method. They then patched it up as best they could without exposing their previous errors, and pretended like nothing had happened. The formal probe issued an interim report with pretty harsh commentary, and was then cancelled by the minister of justice before it could give its final report.Forever changed my view of the Swedish justice system. reply rossant 14 hours agoparentPretty much the same thing happened in France: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cairn.info&#x2F;revue-journal-du-droit-des-jeunes-200...

If your video evidence relies on such a small portion of MPEG encoded video, you can easily mislead a jury to convicting an innocent person.I’m reminded of the Rittenhouse trial where the prosecutors had a technician massage a still from a video for hours until some very tiny collection of pixels, enlarged from the original by quite a bit, were arranged in such a way that they said demonstrated Rittenhouse initiated aggression against the first man he shot.The defense actually had some idea about such a small collection of pixels not being a reliable representation of reality, but couldn’t sufficiently explain it and didn’t have an expert who could, so the judge allowed it. reply Lord-Jobo 18 hours agoparentThis is one of the better litmus tests to see if the expert witness is knowledgeable in the field, and more importantly, up-to-date on the tech. some really smart but definitely older expert witnesses will fumble this very hard.Its not like those kinds of processes, the \"enhancing\" filters, are inherently bad or inadmissible, you just have to be clear with the judge and jury what the hell is actually happening. reply thfuran 17 hours agorootparent>This is one of the better litmus tests to see if the expert witness is knowledgeable in the field, and more importantly, up-to-date on the techIt&#x27;s an absolute travesty that it should fall to expert witnesses at all.

A 16X zoom means one black pixel becomes sixteen pixels, and jurors have to know that the individual pixel may not have ever been an accurate representation of reality.

I can&#x27;t think of any from my class way back when.2. The problem is more that judges and prosecutors are old colleagues. The slant is that they all know the defendants are guilty. There&#x27;s so much crime, and aversion to losing trials, that (unless politics is involved) prosecutors tend to only bring cases where the defendant is clearly guilty.

That is, while liberals might concede that the justice system is flawed, there&#x27;s still an underlying faith that the system will get it right the overwhelming majority of the time.The extreme radical position is that the justice system is fundamentally and irredeemably broken, and that there is no way that a conscientious leftist could work with, let alone within, a system that exists only to oppress the people and reinforce the power of the ruling elite.There&#x27;s obviously a lot of gray between those two positions, but the punchline is that its very possible to be a liberal DA. e.g. Chesa Boudin&#x27;s stated goals exemplify what that&#x27;s supposed to look like, although without unified support from the police and the judiciary, Chesa Boudin also exemplifies what would actually happen.Experiences like that drive the broader leftist calls to defund or abolish the police. If you can&#x27;t get buy in from the entire judicial system to reform itself, then just getting a leftist prosecutor elected&#x2F;appointed will quickly lead to that prosecutor either being ejected from the position, or co-opted by the system they were trying to fix. reply Dalewyn 16 hours agoparentprevObligatory IANAL.>Prosecutors are incentivized to get convictions,Their entire job is to get convictions.

As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the two-fold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor—indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just oneAnother good quote [1]:> For this reason, while a lawyer defending a man accused of a criminal offense should \"exert all his ability, learning, and ingenuity, in such a defence, even if he should be perfectly assured in his own mind of the actual guilt of the prisoner,\" a lawyer should never prosecute \"a man whom he knows or believes to be innocent.\"[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prosecutor#United_States[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ir.lawnet.fordham.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?referer=&h... reply mistermann 10 hours agorootparent>> The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all, and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.Ah yes, and it is politicians (you know, the people who oversee all of this) obligation to govern according to \"the will of the people\"...just like we see in movies, on TV, in the trustworthy and totally independent news, in various simulcast professionally written PR pieces after an incident occurs, etc. (Consensus across the board is how you know it&#x27;s true.

It&#x27;s been discussed for decades, and as best I can tell hasn&#x27;t really been addressed at all.I don&#x27;t know the solution. Ideally, everyone would be good at math, but I don&#x27;t see that happening in the near future. My best answer is for us to provide every court have an on-call statistician, reviewing every case. I would hope big law firms are already doing this, but you should get a mathematically-sound judgement even if you have to depend on an underfunded and overworked public defenders.(More recently, I&#x27;ve been wondering this about scientific publishing. Misusing statistical tests--or choosing the wrong once seems--like a fairly common source of error in peer-reviewed science. It feels like there, too, we need expert statisticians carefully reviewing every paper of note. Given the amounts charged by some journals, it feels like a reasonable service to demand of them.) reply stult 16 hours agoparentIt would help if the legal profession (at least in the US) did not actively select against numeracy. The running joke in law school is that everyone who was a decent student but bad at math goes to law school because the LSATs do not have a math component, unlike the GREs. I’m an engineer and former lawyer, and when I was in law school I actually ended up taking a really disproportionate number of tax law classes because I was so much better than my average peer at basic arithmetic that I could always beat the curve in classes that required basic calculations. And we’re not talking about even intro level algebra, just basic arithmetic. Addition, subtraction, some multiplication and division.By ignoring math skills altogether, the legal profession necessarily ends up selecting for individuals who on average have a poorer understanding of anything quantitative or statistical, and often that also correlates with poorer understanding of all technical and scientific matters, because the same innumeracy means those individuals don’t make it far any sciences at all, even in their secondary or tertiary education. So they often don’t even have strong fundamentals on the basic concepts in those areas.As an engineer, it was maddening to witness and absolutely pervades every aspect of the US legal system. Which both translates into reaching false factual conclusions as in OP, but also infects legal reasoning with a ridiculous lack of rigor (a point which lawyers often dispute vigorously, but they have no concept of just how much rigor they lose by eschewing mathematical and especially statistical reasoning), and it also translates into poorer operational efficiency and administrative efficiency in the legal system, and poorer outcomes from the regulatory system, which, while often informed by technical concerns, remains a primarily legal- and lawyer- driven process. That opens up regulatory bodies to subjective political concerns where there is absolutely no reasonable technical case to be made. This phenomenon is most obvious in recent history with climate change related regulations, but is pervasive throughout the US policy making establishment, and contributes substantially to our challenges with special interests and regulatory capture. reply pc86 17 hours agoparentprev> My best answer is for us to provide every court have an on-call statistician, reviewing every case.Is this not the exact reason for expert witnesses? reply Thrymr 16 hours agorootparentExpert witnesses are inherently adversarial, like the court system itself.

His mug shot was posted alongside a couple dozen others and initial impression was it was organized crime pedaling this stuff. Perception was he&#x27;s guilty; lock him up.The immediate response was he was fired, arrested, etc. There were no facts or investigation but the school was in communication with us and getting info from LEO as the investigation began. We pretty quickly found that no kids were involved (sigh of relief). Then found out it was a part of a FBI sting and he was actually a lone actor not involved in any type of organized &#x27;ring&#x27; (wait, what?). Then about a month after initial arrest, we found out he watched on his computer (streamed or tracked from an FBI server) approximately 3 videos. Unknown duration, unknown intent, unknown everything else. But, having seen the &#x27;legit&#x27; side of the adult industry and how those websites work, I&#x27;m totally of the opinion he probably landed on a website and those videos 1) autoplayed 2) did not indicate or appear as containing underage people 3) or he clicked them and hit back once he realized the &#x27;actors&#x27; appeared a little too young looking.The FBI sting also caught some terrible people and this teacher&#x27;s mug shot in that press release basically made him guilty by association (that didn&#x27;t exist). I don&#x27;t know if this teacher did anything intentionally illegal, but in my opinion the facts that eventually came to be did not substantiate the initial response from law enforcement - which has ruined this man&#x27;s career and ostracized him from our community (at minimum); he&#x27;s still fighting to reduce charges so it&#x27;s likely bankrupted him too.

The justice system isn&#x27;t completely off-kilter.My main issues were that a) many people were overcharged (i.e. charged with extra crimes they were not guilty of) simply to obtain a plea deal; b) often police&#x2F;prosecutor&#x2F;judicial misconduct was used to get the defendant into the justice system and convict them; c) the sentences are often out-of-whack compared to the crime; d) jails and prisons generally offer very little value and rehabilitation. reply cool_dude85 17 hours agorootparent1 out of 20 is still pretty nasty given the size of the US prison population. reply csa 16 hours agorootparentHe said “at least”.And he specified “guilty of what they were charged with”.You also need to factor in the people who are guilty of crime A (that they did commit but were not convicted of) but are convicted of crime B (that they did not commit) for whatever reason.I’ve seen “street justice” like this.

We already knew that was false because Prohibition did not stop people from using alcoholic beverages, or drastically curtail their use; it just created a lucrative black market in alcohol, plus an incentive to violence for the people who ran that market--since they were criminals already, adding violence to the mix wasn&#x27;t a big step. The war on drugs has worked out the same way.The only way to drastically reduce drug use is for people to stop wanting to use drugs. Unfortunately nobody has a really good way to do that.

Yeah he did a lot of other stuff nobody could prove to the standard of a courtroom, but what you&#x27;re talking about is someone \"knows\" Al Capone is bad, so they fabricate crimes and evidence and frame him for those in order to send him to prison. That would still be wrong. This is a feature, not a bug. reply lesuorac 15 hours agorootparentA feature to the prosector maybe but a bug to the public at large.1) People do convince themselves of falsehoods; the person may not actually have done that initial crime. 2) Being able to trump up lessor charges can be (ab)used even if the person didn&#x27;t commit an initial crime but instead is just a ~journalist~ nuisance. reply denton-scratch 15 hours agorootparentprevCapone wasn&#x27;t framed; have I misunderstood you? reply Zigurd 18 hours agorootparentprevMost businesses create and cultivate repeat customers from specific target markets.

Court cases are irregular, judges, the jury, the experts and the type of prosecution matters. Are we more comfortable with different crimes at different rates?In the US, you’re presumed innocent (in the eyes of the law) and many in cases the law can tip the balance over a technicality, such as fruit of the poisoned tree and inability to admit some evidence that would be essential in a layman’s eyes.

I will be the first to admit there are unscrupulous, fame seeking, and overzealous expert witnesses out there. But, there are mechanisms in the courts to filter most of them out. I just think it is not done for money, time, career, or political reasons.I have seen this fail both in the adversarial (e.g., US) and elsewhere in inquisitorial (e.g., EU) court systems.In the adversarial courts, time and time again I watch lawyers refuse to hire expert witnesses for their own side because .Overall, there is also the opportunity for a voir dire of the expert witness. Failure to perform that is again lawyers&#x27; fault.So, who is to blame for all the mistakes? Yes, all of them.Final note regarding experts in court, specifically around professional expert witnesses - there is a racket in the industry where new-comers are kept out. The expert witness industry does some gatekeeping not only for expertise, but for retiring law enforcement in some jurisdictions. For example, in some US states a digital forensics expert required to be a licensed Private Investigator, unless former law enforcement. The PI licensing requirement are completely irrelevant for the expert witness role.Personal anecdotal experience - Lawyer thinks he is technologists, refuses to hire expert witness, begs expert to come middle of the case. Lawyer hires cheapest expert, opposing expert makes haggis out of cheapest expert.Funniest one was where in a small court the State&#x27;s expert start going off on some cockamamie ideas about transference. The opposing expert was an instructor and had one of her classes in court to learn. The class burst out laughing, and the judge had to gavel.

Experts are used by the prosecution AND defense, but the experts used by the prosecution are often times so hilariously and openly biased that its insane how little pushback they get. Career cops with poor credentials that spend 30 years going from witness stand to witness stand saying literally whatever. You can definitely find biased &#x27;pay for opinion&#x27; style experts for defense (its a profitable industry after all), and ive had the misfortune of trying to course correct them and their clients, but they are less frequently biased via a long career in law enforcement, and more importantly, get absolutely flambéed when they display the same level of bullshit as prosec witnesses. There are actual possible consequences for defense experts who lie, you get roasted in a news article that shows up on every google search and nobody with integrity will hire you ever again. That just doesnt happen for prosecution experts, ever. most media is terrified to highlight those bad actors because of the huge pushback they get from cops&#x2F;cop unions&#x2F;and more importantly the rabid facebook populace that will NOT stand for police criticism. and judges will very rarely hand down sanctions. after all, over a third (37 percent) of sitting justices (state supremes) are former prosecutors, while only 7 percent are former public defenders.

Countless instances of smart people who, definitely, beyond any doubt, know and understand what their evidence ACTUALLY indicates, and instead inflate its value to a ludicrous degree.TLDR; If its physical evidence, and not exact DNA match(think tire marks, blood spatter, bite marks), its wouldnt remotely be accurate enough to be court admissible if the courts were functioning properly and vetting expert witnesses properly. if its digital evidence, and there are claims like \"person was at location x,y,z at time a,b,c\" and not in the format \"the device was more likely than not in the general vicinity at the general time\" then they are talking out of their ass. in absence of security footage or the like.my bias: if it wasnt obvious, i work with the defense the majority of the time, on digital evidence, and i am going to see and remember the transgressions of the other side more often. i try to account for that. not a lawyer. so much to learn in the field still. just an internet ignoramus reply Dyac 17 hours agoparentI think the geolocation stuff is particularly concerning.

The police expert&#x27;s sole credentials were a 10 year old A+ certification and a few employer-sponsored day courses, but was confidently representing themselves as an expert in networking&#x2F;computing&#x2F;technology. Their theory of the case was brutal - filled with nonsensical jargon, fabrications and misrepresentations. Things like \"a computer behind a NAT is unreachable from the Internet under any circumstances\". Instances where timestamps were implied to correlate but were actually 6+ hours apart once time zones were factored in. Pages and pages of things in that vein.None of that mattered - they were convicted anyway. It broke my faith in the justice system. The prosecution behaved in exactly the same way as today&#x27;s legions of right-wing conspiracists, grifters and politicians do, because the truthfulness of their words didn&#x27;t matter to them. Because the defense cared about the accuracy of what they were stating, they could be easily drowned out by confident, rapid bullshit and innuendo.I desperately want to find a way to help make the system better, but at every avenue the response has been \"it&#x27;s your funeral\". reply Lord-Jobo 17 hours agorootparentStumbled aimlessly from biology to IT to philosophy to comp sci to criminology, got a lucky internship while working on data recovery and hardware repair.

But only eyewitness testimony as to who.With the current justice system, that would almost certainly be enough for a jury to convict.There are tragic miscarriages of justice from time to time, and certainly DNA evidence should be used whenever possible.

He likely didn&#x27;t have an alibi that could have withstood an eye witness pointing at him and saying \"he did this.\" Had he been at a convenience store on camera, or some other incontrovertible thing, it would have most likely turned out differently.I&#x27;m not sure how a reasonable judge or jury would have come to any other conclusion given what little we know about this third-person retelling of a case so I don&#x27;t think they \"failed\" him at least in the way I typically think of that word being used in these contexts. reply WalterBright 16 hours agorootparentprevEveryone acted in good faith - the lawyers, the judge, the jury, the victim.

But would a typical court of law be able to discern? reply andrewla 17 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think this categorization is technically correct, and even in the places where it is partially correct I don&#x27;t see that the \"off-by-one\" phrasing adds any value.Off-by-one errors are a very specific type of error in algorithm implementation, where a closed boundary and an open boundary are confused. A general bit flip is not really an example of this unless it is connected to this specific kind of mistake.And data corruption is much broader, and can involve adding or removing data from a stream in addition to mutating existing data. Saying that all data mutations are a \"bunch of off-by-one errors\" is just asserting that there exists a hamming distance between any two binary representations of the same length, and I don&#x27;t think this adds a lot of insight.On the other hand, using the term \"off-by-one error\" carries with it a lot of baggage and connotations, most of which do not apply to scenarios you have described or general data corruption. reply albert_e 7 hours agorootparentthank youI was talking very loosely --surely it doesn&#x27;t stand up to any level of scrutiny reply tiahura 18 hours agoprev [–] The article doesn&#x27;t prove anyone was actually innocent, only that dodgy science was admitted.

When something terrible has happened, the human mind looks for the cause, specifically for the person who caused the terrible event.Sometimes, there is a person who did a crime - when someone is shot, that is generally treated as a crime.But sometimes sick people die. Sometimes infants fail to continue breathing. Sometimes wildfires burn a town and kill people. Sometimes viruses jump from (non human) animals to humans.In other words, in human cognition, satisfaction is more important than truth. Scientific truth is a framework whereby we delay our satisfaction with an answer, using specific tools that are socially accepted in that field of study. reply tiahura 15 hours agorootparent [–] \"Have we discovered how to prove a negative\"Yes.

    "originBody": "Text Editor Data Structures: Rethinking Undo 7 minute read Undo and redo have been a staple operation of text editors probably since the first typo was ever made, yet there has not been a lot of innovation around refining the idea of what undo and redo could be. Let’s explore what I mean… On The Subject of Undo Undo In order to understand how to change undo we first need to understand what the fundamental operation of ‘undo’ is supposed to do. I have always learned best through example so let’s assume you start with the string \"Hello\" and you start typing the sequence \" World!\": Helloꞈ In the scenario above, when the undo operation is invoked (typically CTRL+z) what is the typical expectation? There are a myriad of possibilities: Undo would delete the entire string \" World!\" since it was all part of the same insert operation. Undo would delete only the last character added, '!' Undo would delete the sequence of characters within some time threshold of each keystroke. There are many approaches to what the undo operation should do and each one has its own merits. The approach I use is close to #1 where the undo operation will undo blocks of the same style of edit. I find this approach to be useful for my workflow. If you are interested in reading a bit more about how popular text editors more concretely implement undo/redo I encourage you to check out Undo/redo implementations in text editors by Matt Duck who very carefully breaks down the approaches of several editors. There are a few properties of undo that are very nice to have: The undo operation should create a corresponding redo operation, more on redo later. If undo is applied to the beginning of edit history, the system should report that an undo is not possible and do nothing as a result. If you undo (or redo) to the point of the last save of the document the system should recognize that there is nothing to save. Having #3 is very important to me because it helps me understand where my last ‘committed’ work was during an edit session. It seems like a small “nice to have feature” but the system recognizing various points in history is essential for the feature we’re about to implement. Redo Redo is really quite similar to undo in many ways. Let’s take our example of \"Hello World!\", and apply an undo operation (using the preferred implementation above): Hello World!ꞈ ; using UndoRedoChildren = std::vector; struct UndoRedoNode { UndoRedoChildren children; PieceTree::RedBlackTree point; }; Using the definition above, we can create a graph of undo/redo nodes. There might be a question of, why do we need children to be an array? This comes back to our last example where we showed the string \" Cameron!\" inserted. If the undo operation were applied yet again and a new string entered, we would create yet another branch at the root node, so we need the capability of the structure above to refer to all possible states. Visualization Now that we know how we need to model the data, how do we view it? Graph visualization is a massive topic and there are many intuitive ways to view various types of graphs. The graph we are building with our undo data is closer to a tree (but we can talk about how to turn this into something like a DAG in the future). While editing I have always found it useful to associate timestamps with historical data, as they help me get a better idea for roughly what that change might have been, so visualizing the time the change was made is sensible to me. Additionally, since the tree is a sequence made over time it made sense to me to lay out the tree horizontally with branches moving towards the right of the screen, somewhat like a git branch structure visualization. When looking at an undo graph in particular it is generally not sufficient for me to simply see the nodes, I also need to see what those nodes contain so I can make an informed decision about whether or not I actually want to apply that undo/redo operation. Enter, the diffing method. The most natural way for me to see deltas in edits is good ol’ diff. Let’s look at a diff of adding \" World!\" to \"Hello\": -Hello +Hello World! Since I work with git extensively, this is exactly the kind of thing I want to see in the UI as I navigate from the current edit to some other edit in the past. It allows me to reason about the changes the jump will cause. This means there is only one last problem to solve: implementing the diff algorithm in the editor for various types of snap points. Luckily for us, there is a fantastic series of posts by James Coglan (“The Myers diff algorithm”) which goes over all the gory details of how to implement the popular Myers diff algorithm—I can’t recommend this series enough for anyone interested in implementing their own diff algorithm. Putting It All Together Now that we have the data structure and the visualization strategy down, let’s see how it looks all together. Let’s go back to that example where we branched the UI states but had no way to recover the redo of \"Hello\": Helloꞈ And here’s that same series of edits made in fred: When you enter the undo/redo graph mode the editor allows you to navigate to any edit made at any point in time. Additionally, the UI will display the diff from the current edit to the selected node in the upper left-hand corner. It sort of turns your editor into a small source control system! Conclusion What did I learn from this? Immutable data structures remain a fascinating point of interest for me. They enable so many interesting avenues to solve problems. The Myers diff algorithm is incredibly easy to implement, but takes a lot of time to understand what is happening so that you can render it properly. It is going to be hard for me to go back to linear undo/redo of most editors . If you’re also interested in text editor design, the C++ language, or compilers have a chat with me over on Twitter. I’m always interested in learning and sharing any knowledge that could prove to be useful to others. Until next time!

They bring the entire UX into one cohesive feature. The keymap has meaning, because every key symbol is a character, and a macro is just a string. You can paste them, edit them, copy them, then play them back; all without ever leaving Vim&#x27;s primary UX. Macros are stories written, not in vimscript, but in the language of Vim itself.Macros are also the reason I don&#x27;t use Vim anymore. The keymap has meaning, and it shouldn&#x27;t. Want to change your keymap? Good luck.I spent years in Vim. I conceptualized all of it. I built my muscle memory around it. Then I learned a new keyboard layout.I tried remapping the keys. Not only was that impossible (circular dependencies), it broke the conceptual map, too. I have offended the beast, and am welcome no more.What I really want is to start fresh.

Not just for version control but also for collaborations.I always thought, it must be possible because sound is just a list of samples (numbers). Kind of like how a binary executable or assembly code is just a list of values or instructions.Unfortunately most music software and plugins are proprietary as this industry did not have the same political movements (GNU, F(L)OSS, OSS, etc) that the computer industry had and most professional software has been created for professionals by companies.It&#x27;s interesting though because software like Ableton Live has an unlimited undo history but since it is proprietary one can&#x27;t really look at it. reply afc 5 hours agorootparentprevThis resonates with me.

I did not really think about it much, just accepted that was how nvi worked, a single level undo. But that is not true at all. the trick is you have to \"u\" undo then \".\" repeat previous action and you get the full undo stack. and, like the parent post mentioned, you also get a full redo stack the same way.

The Vim manual explains it: How undo and redo commands work depends on the &#x27;u&#x27; flag in &#x27;cpoptions&#x27;. There is the Vim way (&#x27;u&#x27; excluded) and the Vi-compatible way (&#x27;u&#x27; included). In the Vim way, \"uu\" undoes two changes. In the Vi-compatible way, \"uu\" does nothing (undoes an undo). &#x27;u&#x27; excluded, the Vim way: You can go back in time with the undo command. You can then go forward again with the redo command. If you make a new change after the undo command, the redo will not be possible anymore. &#x27;u&#x27; included, the Vi-compatible way: The undo command undoes the previous change, and also the previous undo command. The redo command repeats the previous undo command. It does NOT repeat a change command, use \".\" for that.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimhelp.org&#x2F;undo.txt.html(Actually, I have so rarely used vi that I&#x27;m relying on the implications of the Vim manual that it&#x27;s original vi behavior.) reply derriz 12 hours agorootparentprevWith vim, \"u\" always moves back in time through the undo history, CTRL-r forward. \".\" repeats the last action which changed some text but not stuff like moves or going forward&#x2F;backward through the undo history.nvi sounds very weird to me. reply jyscao 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, in Vim, repeated u&#x27;s just continues undoing, while ctrl-r is for redos. reply wolverine876 12 hours agoparentprev> Vim&#x27;s modal editing results in the user explicitly defining undo&#x2F;redo points.? How? Does switching to normal mode create an undo&#x2F;redo point? Someone asked me if the granularity of Vim&#x27;s undo&#x2F;redo could be increased (i.e., more frequent undo&#x2F;redo points). In what they demonstrated, Vim&#x27;s granularity seemed less than other applications (i.e., undo&#x2F;redo acted on relatively large chunks of input); in some brief research, I didn&#x27;t find a solution. reply ColonelPhantom 7 hours agorootparentWell, in Vim, \"switching to normal mode\" can be thought of as \"ending an insert command\" instead of \"switching modes\", which makes sense as soon as you realize that normal mode is, well, normal.So when you press \"o\", I don&#x27;t think \"switch to insert mode\". I think \"insert a line with the following text:\", which can then be undone with u, repeated with ., or whatever else you want.At least that&#x27;s my mental model of Vim, I don&#x27;t know which is closer to reality. reply thomastjeffery 9 hours agorootparentprevThe \"solution\" is to simply leave insert mode more often. That works great if you are using Vim for editing. If you are using Vim for writing... well, not so much.Then again, if I am writing in Vim, I generally prefer the flow of actively editing what I wrote rather than undoing it.This really applies to Vim as a whole: if you enjoy its UX, it&#x27;s damn near perfection. If you hate it, you can leave. If you love it, but want it to behave just a little differently...then you can probably accomplish that with a plugin&#x2F;configuration....but if you want to change Vim&#x27;s UX more than a little, you&#x27;re fucked.

We’ve seen a couple of others in the space, notably Kakoune and Helix. What do you have in mind? reply thomastjeffery 9 hours agorootparentTL;DR: Most (if not all) of the same features, just not as tightly integrated. Every feature is a piece of the puzzle that is your user config.---Picture Emacs without a default keymap. That&#x27;s a start. The user builds their own UX from scratch; bringing each feature into their config explicitly. Alternatively, the user just grabs a curated config like Doom Emacs. The difference here is that they can read it: all of it.Instead of writing a bunch of imperative elisp (that becomes its own web of circular dependencies), let&#x27;s structure the config with some kind of purely functional additive data structure. That Piece Table I wrote is a good start. Instead of just piecing together letters, let&#x27;s piece together UI and functions.This idea can apply to everything. I envision it as the next generation of shells, of web browsers, of operating systems: everything. Imagine Blender, but you the user add one fruit at a time. Where&#x27;s the button to extrude mesh?

Obviously, one can redo at any point. The undo&#x2F;redo days structure don&#x27;t preserve the state, just the transformations (which are reversible).The gist of it is that when you apply a modification to the buffer and the redo stack isn&#x27;t empty, the redo stack gets flipped and inserted into the undo stack. If you undo a long list of transformations and then make a change, that long list is duplicated, but this hasn&#x27;t been a problem in practice.In case someone finds this interesting, this is mostly implemented here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;edge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;28c031230a8babe888ffe1a... reply danybittel 5 hours agoparentInteresting, none of the editors I just tested (notepad &#x2F; visual studio &#x2F; sublime &#x2F; github) works like this.I think of undo&#x2F;redo as \"time traveling\", going back to where I was one &#x2F; two &#x2F; several steps bevor. The mental model of your implementation is more akin of actually \"doing\" the undo. Like if you undo insert \" world!\", you create an action that deletes \" world!\". The timeline still goes forward, but now has a delete action. reply mlhpdx 5 hours agoprevThe idea of an undo “graph” in memory is something I’ve implemented, and in C++ even, so it was fun to read the article. Couldn’t agree more — once you’ve had it, going back to the linear, often truncated thing most application implement is a little sad.In my case when state A transitioned to B, was undone and further changes made to get state C I would retain the XOR of the changed memory of the A->B transition as run length encoded bytes B’ and similarly C’ so it was lightweight and extremely fast to undo and redo (the latter being exactly the same as the former but applied to A rather than B, since that’s how XOR works). Cool stuff. reply linsomniac 19 hours agoprevI just skimmed it, but it looks like vim really has undo&#x2F;redo \"solved\": - Modal editing makes for nice \"undo\" points, clarifying whether undo should undo \"World!\" or \"!\". - \"g-\" and \"g+\" eliminate the \"orphaned redo\".

Honest question. reply eviks 6 hours agorootparentBecause it&#x27;s too coarse: undoing the whole paragraph instead of just the last word with a typo is too much, so you&#x27;d have to be always aware of this limitation and break flow to switch modes for no other reason than to insert \"undo points\", and these are unnecessary mental bookkeeping chores reply miniupuchaty 4 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have this problem in practise. It&#x27;s not \"break flow to switch modes\" for me. I don&#x27;t type this way. There&#x27;s always as much movement as there&#x27;s typing, especially while programming. Even when writing prose I exit the insert mode each time I think of what to write next making this always a good \"undo point\".If I make a typo while in the insert mode I just remove last character or last word. I guess you could argue that this is something that undo should also cover but I don&#x27;t see much need for that.I&#x27;m not in the insert mode, exiting to normal mode for movement and undo.

Using \"linked list inside a buffer\" is better; this does not preclude trees, the back \"pointer\" just has to specify the offset as well as the previous buffer (when you reach the fixed-size allocation you will also have to do this). If you undo across a buffer change you&#x27;ll also need to update the \"most recent redo\" backlink from the new buffer.* SSO strings will usually beat external strings for small edits (this can be variable-size in the linked-list-in-a-buffer case); for large edits see if you can just incref part of the main editing buffer rope.* It is highly useful to expose a few \"shortcut\" undo commands: undo to previous save, undo to previous build, etc. Manual tags is probably not very practical most of the time, and \"save\" is essentially one anyway. reply hasoleju 14 hours agoprevReading the comments on how vim and Emacs have implemented Undo&#x2F;Redo with various options was very helpful.

And that is different from just your standard redo. It definitely needs some getting used to but it is very powerful.But I think your second points deserves an even bigger mention: Emacs has the ability to apply undo only to a certain \"region\" - which in Emacs parlance is basically just a selection of text. For those of you who have never seen it: imagine two parts of a file you&#x27;re editing, say one part at the top, one at the bottom. You start by editing the first part (top) and then then move your cursor somewhere down to the second part of the file (bottom) to do some more editing there. But then you realize that your edits in the first part of the file were baloney. In most other editors, if you wanted to undo them, you&#x27;d be forced to also undo the edits in the second part of the file. In Emacs, however, you can simply select the first part at the top of your file - if you hit undo then, it will only undo the last edits done inside that selection and leave all edits outside of that region untouched. reply layer8 13 hours agorootparentWhat happens when, for example, you atomically replace “mouse” by “elephant”, then select “epha”, and then region-undo?The reason most editors don’t implement this is probably that it’s hard to conceive of how it should behave in the general case.

    "originLink": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/section-702-needs-reform-and-oversight-not-expansion-congress-should-oppose-hpsci",
    "originBody": "Earlier this week, both the House Committee on the Judiciary (HJC) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) marked up two very different bills (H.R. 6570 - Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act in HJC, and HR 6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 in HPSCI), both of which would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)—but in very different ways. Both bills head to the House floor next week under a procedural rule called “Queen of the Hill,” where the bill with the most votes gets sent to the Senate for consideration. While renewing any surveillance authority remains a complicated and complex issue, this choice is clear - we urge all Members to vote NO on the Intelligence Committee’s bill, H.R.6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023. Take action TELL congress: Defeat this bad 702 Bill On Nov. 16, HPSCI released a report calling for reauthorization of Section 702 with essentially superficial reforms. The bill that followed, H.R. 6611, was as bad as expected. It would renew the mass surveillance authority Section 702 for another eight years. It would create new authorities that the intelligence community has sought for years, but that have been denied by the courts. It would continue the indiscriminate collection of U.S. persons’ communications when they talk with people abroad for use by domestic law enforcement. This was not the intention of this national security program, and people on U.S. soil should not have their communications collected without a warrant because of a loophole. As a reminder, Section 702 was designed to allow the government to warrantlessly surveil non-U.S. citizens abroad for foreign intelligence purposes. Increasingly, it’s this U.S. side of digital conversations that domestic law enforcement agencies trawl through—all without a warrant. FBI agents have been using the Section 702 databases to conduct millions of invasive searches for Americans’ communications, including those of protesters, racial justice activists, 19,000 donors to a congressional campaign, journalists, and even members of Congress. Additionally, the HPSCI bill authorizes the use of this unaccountable and out-of-control mass surveillance program as a new way of vetting asylum seekers by sifting through their digital communications. According to a newly released Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) opinion, the government has sought some version of this authority for years, but was repeatedly denied it, only receiving court approval for the first time this year. Because the court opinion is so heavily redacted, it is impossible to know the current scope of immigration- and visa-related querying, or what broader proposal the intelligence agencies originally sought. This new authority proposes to give immigration services the ability to audit entire communication histories before deciding whether an immigrant can enter the country. This is a particularly problematic situation that could cost someone entrance to the United States based on, for instance, their own or a friend’s political opinions—as happened to a Palestinian Harvard student when his social media account was reviewed when coming to the U.S. to start his semester. The HPSCI bill also includes a call “to define Electronic Communication Service Provider to include equipment.” Earlier this year, the FISA Court of Review released a highly redacted opinion documenting a fight over the government's attempt to subject an unknown company to Section 702 surveillance. However, the court agreed that under the circumstances the company did not qualify as an \"electronic communication service provider\" under the law. Now, the HPSCI bill would expand that definition to include a much broader range of providers, including those who merely provide hardware through which people communicate on the Internet. Even without knowing the details of the secret court fight, this represents an ominous expansion of 702's scope, which the committee introduced without any explanation or debate of its necessity. By contrast, the House Judiciary Committee bill, H.R. 6570, the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act, would actually address a major problem with Section 702 by banning warrantless backdoor searches of Section 702 databases for Americans’ communications. This bill would also prohibit law enforcement from purchasing Americans’ data that they would otherwise need a warrant to obtain, a practice that circumvents core constitutional protections. Importantly, this bill would also renew this authority for only three more years, giving Congress another opportunity to revisit how the reforms are implemented and to make further changes if the government is still abusing the program. EFF has long fought for significant changes to Section 702. By the government’s own numbers, violations are still occurring at a rate of more than 4,000 per year. Our government, with the FBI in the lead, has come to treat Section 702—enacted by Congress for the surveillance of foreigners on foreign soil —as a domestic surveillance program of Americans. This simply cannot be allowed to continue. While we will continue to push for further reforms to Section 702, we urge all members to reject the HPSCI bill.

    "title": "Transpiling WebAssembly to C: A Runtime-Free Alternative",
    "originLink": "https://00f.net/2023/12/11/webassembly-compilation-to-c/",
    "originBody": "When we think “a fast AOT WebAssembly compiler and runtime”, we typically think about V8, Wasmer, WasmEdge or Wasmtime. All of these have in common that they are large, complicated pieces of software, that come with a lot of overhead, and only work on a limited set of platforms. But how about transpiling WebAssembly code to C source code, and leveraging the state-of-the-art optimization passes of C compilers? This is the approach taken by the wasm2c tool from the WABT package, as well as the single-file WebAssembly transpiler used to bootstrap the Zig compiler. The output of these tools is really a line-by-line conversion of the WebAssembly code to dumb, unoptimized C code. There are instant benefits to this. First, the ouptut is kinda human readable, which is useful for debugging. A WebAssembly function shows up as a regular C function, that can be directly called from C or any language with a C FFI. Take existing C code, compile it to WebAssembly, transpile it back to C, and you get the same code, but sandboxed. The transformation acts as a sanitizer that improves safety by restricting the range of virtual memory accessible to each instance. Of course, that works with any WebAssembly module, no matter what original languages it was written in. With this approach, assembling different WebAssembly modules also becomes very easy. Startup time is negligible. There’s no overhead. No runtime either. Just WebAssembly functions directly transpiled to C functions, that are trivial to embed in any project. The reponsibility to compile that source code to native code is left to a regular C compiler. If the generated C source code is portable enough, this is also a great way to compile and run WebAssembly on embedded targets and new operating systems, that require custom compilers. This approach can also greatly improve security and reliability. Because they don’t perform any optimization, WebAssembly to C transpilers are extremely small and simple. And the resulting code can even be compiled with formally-verified C compilers such as CompCert for high assurance code generation. But how about features, usability and performance? w2c2 w2c2 is probably the most advanced of these transpilers. Among other things, it supports many WebAssembly extensions, including WASI-core and threads. This is a fantastic piece of software, but it unfortunately requires a bit of work to setup and use. Installing w2c2 Clone the w2c2 repository: git clonecd w2c2 Compile it: mkdir build cd build cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. make Define where the files will be installed: export W2C2_DIR=/tmp/w2c2 Install them: install -d \"$W2C2_DIR\"/{bin,lib,include/{w2c2,wasi}} install -s w2c2/w2c2 \"$W2C2_DIR\"/bin/ install wasi/libw2c2wasi.a \"$W2C2_DIR\"/lib/ install -m 0644 ../w2c2/w2c2_base.h \"$W2C2_DIR\"/include/w2c2/ install -m 0644 ../wasi/wasi.h \"$W2C2_DIR\"/include/wasi/ Alright, let’s get back to the root directory, and add w2c2 to the PATH environment variable: cd ../.. export PATH=\"$W2C2_DIR\"/bin:$PATH rehash # only needed on some shells such as zsh On macOS, the w2c2 command weights about 150KB only. Yes, that’s all we need to compile WebAssembly modules. For reference, the wasmer executable alone is 42MB large. Creating a WebAssembly file Next, let’s clone the Zig project boilerplate in order to get an example WebAssembly module: mkdir test && cd test zig init zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall \\ -Dcpu=baseline+bulk_memory+sign_ext+nontrapping_fptoint The resulting WebAssembly module can be found in zig-out/bin/test.wasm. By defaut, WebAssembly modules created by Zig aim at maximizing portability, so they target the baseline virtual CPU, that doesn’t enable any WebAssembly extension. However, bulk memory, sign extension and non-trapping floating point are not a problem for w2c2, so we enable them. The above example doesn’t use threads, but since Zig supports WASI threads, we could add +atomic to the list of features in order to run multithreaded WebAssembly code. Compiling WebAssembly to C Now that we have a test.wasm WebAssembly module, the time has come to convert it to C. mkdir transpiled && cd transpiled w2c2 -p ../zig-out/bin/test.wasm test.c The above command creates the test.c and test.h files, containing a C version of our WebAssembly module. Since the module was named test, automatically generated functions are given test prefix. This allows multiple modules to be used together in the same application without name collisions. Let’s try compiling this to native code, using a C compiler. zig cc test.c -I. -I\"$W2C2_DIR\"/include -L\"$W2C2_DIR\"/lib -lw2c2wasi error: undefined reference to symbol_main error: undefined reference to symbol _wasiMemory note: referenced in /private/tmp/w2c2/lib/libw2c2wasi.a(wasi.c.o) error: undefined reference to symbol_trap note: referenced in /Users/j/.cache/zig/o/5868ac77d407c9e2eae52a37fd79e706/test.o The code contains our translated functions, but we still need to instantiate the module and call functions in order to get an application we can actually run. Let’s create a main.c file to do so: #include#include#include#include#include \"test.h\" void trap(Trap trap) { fprintf(stderr, \"TRAP: %s\", trapDescription(trap)); abort(); } wasmMemory *wasiMemory(void *instance) { return test_memory((testInstance *) instance); } extern char **environ; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { testInstance i; testInstantiate(&i, NULL); if (!wasiInit(argc, argv, environ)) { fprintf(stderr, \"failed to initialize WASI\"); return 1; } test__start(&i); testFreeInstance(&i); return 0; } In WebAssembly commands, the entry point is named _start(). Functions transpiled to C are named _, so in order to call the _start() function, we simply call test__start() with the instance as an argument. Now that we have a main function, let’s compile all this, and link the w2c2 WASI-core implementation by the way since our test example uses it. zig cc -o test -O3 -s main.c test.c \\ -I. -I\"$W2C2_DIR\"/include/w2c2 -I\"$W2C2_DIR\"/include/wasi \\ -L\"$W2C2_DIR\"/lib -lw2c2wasi Done! We can now run our application: ./test All your codebase are belong to us. Yep, that’s it! Our WebAssembly module got converted into a small, self-contained, native executable. Executable size and memory usage are ridiculously small compared to traditional runtimes. How about speed? Certainly, code blindly transpiled to C cannot be as efficient as a dedicated WebAssembly compiler, right? Let’s compile the famous libsodium test/benchmark suite to WebAssembly: zig build -Denable_benchmarks -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi -Doptimize=ReleaseFast \\ -Dcpu=baseline+bulk_memory+sign_ext+nontrapping_fptoint The resulting tests are placed into the zig-out/bin directory. Now, let’s try a pretty heavy one, such as the Ed25519 signature test: zig-out/bin/sign.wasm. The tests print the time they take to complete, excluding initialization and finalization. First, with wasmtime, enabling all the supported extensions: ❯ time wasmtime run --wasm-features=all test.wasm 625928560000 wasmtime run --wasm-features=all /tmp/test.wasm 124.76s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 2:05.21 total Then, after transpiling the module to C using w2c2 and compiling it with zig cc: ❯ time ./test 361604070000 ./test 73.38s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 1:13.65 total You got that right. A naive transpilation to C almost always beats dedicated WebAssembly compilers, sometimes by a large margin. That may change over time, though. Downsides Of course, there are downsides. An obvious one being that this is incompatible with just-in-time compilation or singlepass compilation. Compilation is not fast, since an initial transpilation pass is required. The wasm-to-C approach would thus not be a good fit for running arbitrary code in a Web browser. But no matter what the runtime is, with the wasm32 target, memory accesses are limited to 32-bit offsets. Taking advantage of this and virtual memory, runtimes usually add guard pages around each instance’s memory in order to catch accesses outside the reserved areas. But the code currently generated by w2c2 doesn’t automatically setup these guard pages. This is still left to the application. As an alternative to guard pages, for wasm64 or on platforms without virtual memory, some traditional WebAssembly compilers can decorate memory accesses with bound-checking code. w2c2 currently can’t, but it totally could. In spite of having excellent support for WebAssembly extensions, WASI-core and WASI-threads, w2c2 intentionally doesn’t have bells and whistles, some of them being critical for some applications. For example, traditional runtimes often support gas metering and preemption, which are mandatory for many applications. Is it for you? If the justification to use WebAssembly is the ability to improve code safety, then w2c2 (and the generic wasm-to-C approach) is for you. The result will be small, efficient and easy to use in any language with a C FFI. On platforms not supported by big runtimes, w2c2 may also work for you, and the resulting native code will be faster than interpreters such as wasm3. For all other cases, traditional runtimes still offer way more features and flexibility.",

The goal is for a possible adversary to take a C program and produce an IR, and then for somebody else (maybe you) to validate that IR and produce safe machine code. Wasm is a vastly better interchange format between distrustful parties than C would be!(There are probably even better interchange formats coming on the horizon; Zachary Yedidia has some cutting-edge work on \"lightweight fault isolation\" that will be presented at the upcoming ASPLOS. Earlier talk here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AM5fdd6ULF0 . But outside of the research world, it&#x27;s hard to beat Wasm for this.)Less important: I don&#x27;t think going through Wasm has to be viewed as an \"extra step\" -- every compiler uses an IR, and if you want that IR to easily admit a \"safe\" lowering (especially one that enforces safety across independently compiled translation units), it will probably look at least a little like Wasm, which is quite minimal in its design.

Achieving something similar in a high level language like Javascript would involve mapping all application data into a single ArrayBuffer \"pseudo heap\", and at that point, it&#x27;s easier and more maintainable to do the same thing in C (or C++ or Rust).Having said all that: modern Javascript engines can perform surprisingly well (in general I&#x27;m seeing that Javascript performance is underrated, and WASM performance is often overrated - sane Javascript, WASM and native code can all be in the same performance ballpark, but native code usually has the most \"optimization potential\"). reply hutzlibu 4 hours agorootparentAssemblyscript is unfortunately not that fast (yet?), same as javascript in most cases, also because it uses a garbage collector.\"in general I&#x27;m seeing that Javascript performance is underrated, and WASM performance is often overrated - sane Javascript, WASM and native code can all be in the same performance ballpark, but native code usually has the most \"optimization potential\"\"And strong disagree.

Webassembly solves the problem of \"how do I deploy this software that isn&#x27;t written in Javascript to the browser client?\".Sure, it also is sorta about performance, but JS interpreters are actually shockingly fast in the modern world. Mostly wasm is about moving your existing C++ code (or whatever) for your existing formats or algorithms or tools into a web&#x2F;mobile client without having to hire someone to recode it all in TypeScript or whatever.

The implications of a relatively fast universal runtime that can safely sandbox untrusted code are quite far-reaching, and it will probably take a while to see the end-game. Docker and containers have been around for a fairly long time, and while the uptake of containers to solve problems has gradually increased over time, it&#x27;s still nowhere near the peak. I think this is likewise true for WebAssembly, which has more potential than we currently know what to do with.Personally I think the focus for web technologies should be deprecating old things and being very judicial about adding new things. New things that get added have to be maintained by all browser engines effectively forever, and this is part of why every browser engine is a huge multi-million dollar per year endeavor just to maintain. Meanwhile, a lot of features being added to browsers don&#x27;t necessarily justify all of this cost. Layout engines are unmanageably complex already. CSS is unmanageably complex already. I think adding even more stuff is hardly the solution, but rather, we need to figure out how to actually utilize what&#x27;s here better before we can actually come up with successors. Rather than adding more scoped CSS and CSS modules junk, I&#x27;d rather just have improvements to CSS-in-JS. Maybe some targeted new APIs that make it easier to implement these features in the browser, not entire new paradigms that require implementing hundreds of thousands of new lines of code that will have to be maintained indefinitely. Likewise for web components: the concept is fine, but every browser has to maintain all of this forever, and all of the edge cases that come from it; will it yield so much benefit from what exists today? Will it actually stop people from shipping megabytes of Javascript, or could they have already stopped doing that if they really wanted to, and all this will do is mop it around a bit? A large node_modules folder disappears when a web app disappears. A large Chromium source code checkout only continues to grow larger effectively forever.WebAssembly though, gets a pass from me, because it&#x27;s far more than \"Web\", but the Web part adds a lot to the overall package. It&#x27;s just a win all around. reply prmph 13 hours agorootparentThe unmanageable complexity is exactly the result of the current architecture of browsers. My proposal is to rip off all that cruft and actually address the pain points of web dev in a modern way.For example, CSS is a disaster.

I wonder if compiling to another GC language, like Go, might help, or if they can just use a GC library like tgc or Oilpan. reply csjh 16 hours agoparentI&#x27;d imagine the majority won&#x27;t support GC, at least not for some time reply slimsag 6 hours agorootparentI think WASM has a problem which isn&#x27;t really noticed&#x2F;worked on yet (at least, that&#x27;s my perspective)The WASM GC will be good, not because it&#x27;s a GC, but because it would allow languages compiled to WASM to interoperate with e.g. the DOM using the same memory manager so you&#x27;re not e.g. manually managing the memory of DOM objects while JS may hold references to them according to the terms of the GC.But this also means the DOM API will be tied to the GC, right? I don&#x27;t know this for fact, but logically that seems correct. So languages that do NOT have good use of the GC are going to be at a disadvantage when it comes to interacting with the DOM, presumably.Meanwhile, the runtimes of languages like Go and modern Java (after Java gets goroutine-like behavior from project loom) rely on small ~8kb stacks and the ability to swap the stack to a new goroutine using setjmp&#x2F;longjmp - but WASM isn&#x27;t a traditional register machine like x86 ASM, instead it&#x27;s more of a stack machine.. with no setjmp&#x2F;longjmp.So not only do languages like Go and Java need to &#x27;decouple&#x27; their runtimes for goroutine-like behavior from their GC and make use of the WASM GC instead (which is not tailored to the usage patterns of such languages), but they also need to emulate their own register machine &#x27;on top of&#x27; the WASM stack machine so that their goroutine-like behavior works in WASM. Back in 2017 my coworker did this for Go, and so far as I know the implementation has not moved on from that approach since because there is no alternative.So for Go and Java, you&#x27;d be working with a GC that isn&#x27;t designed for the language and presumably that has performance implications.. and you&#x27;d be working with an emulated register machine on top of a sandboxed stack machine (WASM)... that all starts to seem quite a bit far from &#x27;low level like native code&#x27; that WASM aims to promise.I hope I&#x27;m wrong, but I fear Go&#x2F;Java do not have a bright, performant, future when it comes to WASM.Zig, C++, Rust - all probably have a bright future here.

Presumably WASM is made safe by limiting the ability of the code in some way. Otherwise the checks that occur as part of the C -> WASM -> C pipeline could be built into your standard C compiler.So what do we lose as part of this round trip?Just speed? Nothing else? reply aseipp 10 hours agoparentYou could build Software Fault Isolation into an existing compiler toolchain, and people have done it, but WebAssembly comes with an existing constraint which is why it&#x27;s designed the way it is: a WASM file may be generated by an unknown or untrustworthy participant and needs to be consumed in a trustworthy context, i.e. served from a random HTTP server into a users browser. Therefore the WASM file format has stringent requirements and a strict validation algorithm placed on it before you should execute it.So, you&#x27;re doing a classic thing in verification, which is just writing a \"checker\" that implements some (known good) algorithm in the smallest and most correct way possible, and then using that to check whether much bigger \"unknown\" things are safe. The goal is that the checker is much easier to implement correctly than auditing everything by hand.For example, you might have a media player with extensions (like foobar2000); traditionally extensions would be delivered as .dlls, because developers did not release the source. This would be a use case similar to the browser, where WebAssembly would be a good choice instead of random .dll files. They may not want to release the code, but you don&#x27;t want to trust a random blob of binary code. If you trust your WASM implementation, you don&#x27;t need to trust that the binary blob is harmless (it will just be rejected or forbidden from doing bad things.)If you&#x27;re not dealing with \"random binary blob from potentially untrusted source\", i.e. you are running the compiler yourself on some code you downloaded, and then running that code, then you don&#x27;t really need WASM for this, because you could reasonably trust the compiler to uphold the security guarantees using SFI techniques. For example, if you wanted to make sure zlib was safe from buffer overflows in your main process, to reduce blast radius, a pure SFI toolchain would be fine. You can trust it works and then just compile zlib yourself.But there&#x27;s generally a lot more mindset and movement around WASM than anything else, so people use it for all of these cases, even cases where they control both the compiler generating code, and where the code is being run. reply legulere 17 hours agoprevThe difficulty of sandboxes is to offer a usable, useful API to the outside world that is still secure.

I would think that transpilation can just avoid bad practices like passing around void * pointers and then casting them optimistically, or even the use of char * for strings in favor of a bounds-checked alternative. reply lmm 11 hours agorootparentC can&#x27;t represent lots of information that would be useful, e.g. while C99 has a limited \"restrict\" function, you can&#x27;t express any more complex detail of \"these things can only alias under these circumstances\". If the hardware supports doing anything useful with sum types (e.g. atomic operations), there is no way to expose that in the C model. C specifies a concept of trap representations but anything you would actually do with them is undefined behaviour, so you can&#x27;t write code that e.g. safely errors out when someone tries to use an uninitialized pointer. Even for arithmetic on standard hardware, the ability to fully express even quite basic things is limited - you can&#x27;t write code that e.g. permits signed overflow to occur and handles it if it does. You effectively can&#x27;t use any floating point rounding modes except the most broken one, at least not if your code ever uses threads. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more. reply nbittich 16 hours agoprevSo you take a language that compiles to wasm, then you take your wasm output and transpile it to c?

It gives very little (if any?) practical benefits and it just massively complicates everything, both the compilers and the VMs.I&#x27;m not speculating here. I have a pet VM that I&#x27;m developing for a register-based IR which achieves roughly the same execution performance of guest programs as wasmtime, but compiles them into native code 160 times faster, doesn&#x27;t compromise on security, has a bytecode format which takes roughly as much space as WASM, and with an implementation that is vastly less complex (wasmtime&#x27;s Cranelift is ~150k lines of code; my codegen is, maybe, ~2k lines of code, depending on how you count). reply pjmlp 15 hours agorootparentprevStart with Burroughs Large Machines from 1961, do a stop at Xerox PARC, visit ETHZ, Bell Labs, Amsterdam University, Caltech, Tao Group, UCSD, IBM and Unisys mainframes, Microsoft R&D, and already there are several bytecodes to look into.The hype around WebAssembly is also not very interesting for those of us that have read hundreds of papers on those bytecodes, but hey there is VC money to burn. reply jrockway 15 hours agorootparentI think that network effects win over technical merit every time, and this time WebAssembly has the momentum. I think it&#x27;s pretty neat that you can take a web server written in C++, implement some new compression algorithm in Go, and then have that web server compress pages with your Go code without having to recompile the webserver or touch any of its code. That&#x27;s what WebAssembly outside of the browser offers; you can just write stuff in your language of choosing for other products. All the VC hype just means that everyone picked the same backend so there is some possibility of traction.In reality, some flaws are preventing adoption. C and Rust are pretty much the only viable languages with WebAssembly support, and since those are also the chosen implementation languages for runtime, nobody is really deriving this benefit. (Anything with a runtime seems to fail for programs beyond \"hello world\".)(I tried a \"real program\" and WebAssembly once, but it ran out of memory when compiled with either gc or tinygo. We had to write the browser side of things in Javascript, which was a shame. The code in question was: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pachyderm&#x2F;pachyderm&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;inter.... Somewhat complex, but not so complex you can&#x27;t do it in Javascript. So a bit of a shame that WebAssembly didn&#x27;t work out.)The other thing that I think WebAssembly should fix (but people seem to want to kill me when I mention this) is that the Typescript compiler should just output WebAssembly and we can forget about node_modules and Webpack and that whole nightmare. There is AssemblyScript, but it doesn&#x27;t run React, so doesn&#x27;t matter for this use case.Someday I will go insane and just compile node or deno to WebAssembly and just ship the whole VM with my app embedded in it.

That is, the server you are embedded in has one thread per client or backend. In a modern server architecture I suspect you could still use KVM if you put your mind to it. For example, switching between internal processes doesn&#x27;t have to be done according to Linux scheduling. KVM is just a hypervisor architecture, and even though it requires you to call it from the current thread, you can still build fast process isolation on it. Source: I have done it.Launching a new VM is not something that should be done outside of a restart or reconfiguration.I think for me, what WASM brings to the table is perhaps reduced Linux-isms. Everything has become a little bit Linux-or-nothing, and if WASM presents a unified API towards all operating systems that is a good thing.

    "originBody": "Computer Science > Databases arXiv:2312.00638 (cs) [Submitted on 1 Dec 2023] Title:What if an SQL Statement Returned a Database? Authors:Joris Nix, Jens Dittrich Download PDF Abstract:Every SQL statement is limited to return a single, possibly denormalized, table. This design decision has far reaching consequences. (1.) for databases users in terms of slow query performance, long query result transfer times, usability-issues of SQL in web applications and object-relational mappers. In addition, (2.) for database architects it has consequences when designing query optimizers leading to logical (algebraic) join enumeration effort, memory consumption for intermediate result materialization, and physical operator selection effort. So basically, the entire query optimization stack is shaped by that design decision. In this paper, we argue that the single-table limitation should be dropped. We extend the SELECT-clause of SQL by a keyword 'RESULTDB' to support returning a result database. Our approach has clear semantics, i.e. our extended SQL returns subsets of all tables with only those tuples that would be part of the traditional (single-table) query result set, however without performing any denormalization through joins. Our SQL-extension is downward compatible. Moreover, we discuss the surprisingly long list of benefits of our approach. First, for database users: far simpler and more readable application code, better query performance, smaller query results, better query result transfer times. Second, for database architects, we present how to leverage existing closed source systems as well as change open source database systems to support our feature. We propose a couple of algorithms to integrate our feature into both closed-source as well as open source database systems. We present an initial experimental study with promising results.

Like Datomic?Sometimes the result of function call in Datomic is a copy of the database with the updates applied. It allows you to preview how your transaction will affect the data, were that choice to be made. Datalog allows for this kind of return.Were Postgres to add something like this (and if I&#x27;m not inferring too much from the title and commentary here) it wouldn&#x27;t the first time that the industry took a lesson from Rich Hickey&#x27;s resurrection of older tech (Datalog). reply shrimpx 11 hours agoparentNo. This paper is not about returning a copy of the database with the updates applied. It is about a \"normalized join\" query type.Edit: clarification. reply erichocean 11 hours agorootparent> No. It does not return a copy of the database with the updates applied.At first I thought you were talking about Datomic (which does, indeed, \"return a copy of the database with updates applied\"). But you are talking about the paper, which is about something else apparently.Carry on… reply shrimpx 11 hours agorootparentThanks I updated to clarify. reply qaq 11 hours agoparentprevwell Postgres does not need to do anything you can start a transaction and you have exactly that. reply crazygringo 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;m struggling to understand the purpose of this.If I understand it correctly, for a query with joins, then instead of returning a single combined set of results with the information you need, it returns multiple sets of results based on each separate table.But I don&#x27;t understand why that would ever be desirable.I always write my queries to return the information I need, per whatever \"key\" I need, in each row. Splitting that up in multiple sets of results is not helpful.Or if I really need multiple sets of data, I write multiple queries.So I really don&#x27;t get what this is for. It&#x27;s like it takes one of the biggest features of databases -- joins -- and removes it? Why? reply default-kramer 12 hours agoparentFirst the authors show that for certain use cases, a single query is not ideal. Either the result set will be larger than it needs to be, or it will have to use something like ARRAY_AGG which \"discard[s] all schema and relational information on the way.\" So let&#x27;s assume that we are in a situation where a single query is not desirable.Then the authors show ways to use multiple queries (in section 3, \"SQL-BASED REWRITE METHODS\"). Each method has its drawbacks. If you&#x27;ve done enough SQL, these patterns will look familiar to you. Compare the syntax needed here vs the proposed \"SELECT RESULTDB\" syntax in Listing 3 and you should see that their proposal is easier to write. Then in section 4, the authors \"present an algorithm that can be integrated into a DBMS to efficiently compute the result set of our SELECT RESULTDB queries.\" Presumably this would be more efficient than any of the alternatives from section 3. reply crazygringo 10 hours agorootparent> First the authors show that for certain use cases, a single query is not ideal.Reading it closely, this is what I already disagree with. You do a good job of summarizing their two main arguments, so allow me to rebut:> Either the result set will be larger than it needs to beYes, they&#x27;re using the example of repeating information (denormalization), such as multiple courses taught by the same professor. But it&#x27;s genuinely hard to see this as a drawback -- that&#x27;s a feature. Data should be stored as normalized as possible, but queries are supposed to denormalize to present information in the desired format.(And if you&#x27;re dealing with what would be an overly-large amount of repeated values, you just run multiple queries yourself instead of one. And if round-trip latency is some kind of issue with running queries sequentially, you can always issue queries in parallel instead.)> which \"discard[s] all schema and relational information on the way.\"Again, this is a feature. You&#x27;re not supposed to retrieve all possible relational information in query results. You write your query to retrieve and differentiate precisely what you need and no more. Discarding irrelevant information is a feature, not a bug. More than that -- you want your query to define and adhere to its output format regardless of the underlying database structure, precisely so you can refactor things in the database and rewrite the query but not need to rewrite the code that uses the query results.I guess my overall bafflement is that the things they describe as \"not ideal\" seem to me like features rather than problems, and these features have been highly beneficial in my practical experience of writing a lot of database-driven apps. reply JohnBooty 6 hours agorootparentnext [–]but queries are supposed to denormalizeWell, that&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve always worked, yes.Might there be a better way for some use cases? denormalize to present information in the desired formatWhat if my \"desired format\" is a structure that maintains the relationships specified in the database?This is an incredibly common pattern, particularly with ORMs. # psuedocode for each recipe in Recipe.joins(Ingredient).select_all() do for each ingredient in recipe.ingredients do print(f\"{recipe.name} requires {ingredient.name}\")Depending on the ORM and the query options specified, this results in one of the following:1. Everything getting denormalized into a single, wasteful result table and then teased back out into Recipes and Ingredients by the ORM2. Two SQL queries. One to fetch the recipes, and then one to fetch the ingredients once we know the id&#x27;s of the recipies.3. A big ol&#x27; N+1 situation with 1 query to fetch recipes and then N additional queries to fetch the ingredients.They all have various inefficiencies. What if we just returned the relational structures directly? reply lsh123 5 hours agorootparentDon’t use ORM for performance critical DB operations and write SQL by hand might be another answer. Case in point: I recently improved performance of my email app by about 250x by replacing SwiftData with native SQLite database (and manual sql queries). The message data is under 1M rows range plus a lot of blobs&#x2F;attachments (under 10MB each). reply lmm 8 hours agorootparentprev> Data should be stored as normalized as possible, but queries are supposed to denormalize to present information in the desired format.But the desired format usually isn&#x27;t a square, flat table. Usually the data has structure and you want to preserve that structure when you&#x27;re displaying, not just having it hidden in the database. E.g. you might want to show a heading for each professor and then a list of classes taught by that professor. Getting back a flat table with n duplicate copies of the professor&#x27;s information is a step backwards. reply jrumbut 9 hours agorootparentprev> Data should be stored as normalized as possible, but queries are supposed to denormalize to present information in the desired format.The desired format depends on the application.At this point a substantial portion of all SQL queries are generated by (and the results consumed by) ORMs.For that use case having results that include Products and Categories separately (so you can instantiate Product and Category objects) is more useful than a single table. reply bradley13 4 hours agorootparentprevThis. If your query returns a database rather than denormalized information? Guess what, you now get to query that returned database.Honestly, it sounds like they haven&#x27;t really grasped the purpose of relational databases. reply hrdwdmrbl 8 hours agorootparentprev> And if you&#x27;re dealing with what would be an overly-large amount of repeated values, you just run multiple queries yourself instead of one.It is a bit annoying to do this though.

If you do a join and include the customer name in the result set it&#x27;s going to amount to a lot of repeated data that has to be sent across the network. Instead, you could receive two result sets, one with only the relevant customers and the other with the orders containing only the customer ID. The amount of data getting sent across the network will be massively reduced and you can still reference the customer names at the other end. reply oleg_antonyan 12 hours agoparentprevIt could be useful with ORM. For example, in Rails ActiveRecord instantiates the class for each row. But when you need to write complex query with many joins and instantiate AR models tree from it becomes either cumbersome or leads to n+1 queries. Still pretty niche usecase, but looks interesting reply julian37 12 hours agorootparentRight, but fetching rows along with a bunch of related rows from other tables isn&#x27;t niche, it&#x27;s literally the _raison d&#x27;etre_ of GraphQL (simplifying a bit because GraphQL types don&#x27;t necessarily map onto db tables.)It&#x27;s something lots of apps need all the time. reply tadfisher 5 hours agorootparentStatic-language clients need to create a class (or collection of classes) for each GraphQL query, or forgo type safety (typically just null-safety, but I suppose you could treat each result as a dictionary type). Creating just the schema-level types, with relationships modeled separately, does throw out some of the benefits (\"just the data you need\") but simplifies the client, moreso if the client may perform multiple complex queries on the same data. reply ako 5 hours agorootparentprevYou can do that in Postgres, either return nested json structures, or nested arrays.For an example see: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shusson.info&#x2F;post&#x2F;building-nested-json-objects-with-... reply keithnz 12 hours agoparentprevso, if you want to join two things, a parent and children, you get duplication of parent detailseg, select P.name, C.* from Parent P inner join Child C on C.Parent_id = P.Id where P.Id = 1234so from what I can tell is this idea would have a result set of a Parent table and child tables based on the join and projection with no duplication? At least that&#x27;s what I understand it to be. That seems useful. reply nhinck2 4 hours agoparentprevIf I wanted to get some patients who had either condition x y or z and likely they had more one of those conditions, this would be a useful way to return the data.The list of patients remains distinct but which of the conditions they had would still be referencable.It&#x27;s a nice shortcut but not world changing. reply shrimpx 11 hours agoparentprevI guess it&#x27;s kind of like doing all the things a join query would do, like mapping rows together, filtering, sorting, and grouping, but the final output is denormalized into several \"tables\" without duplication. From what I gather, the main \"win\" is the size reduction in the result set, which can impact network and memory usage. Yes you can do this yourself by running multiple queries, one on each table. Presumably by paying the latency of multiple round trips. reply jtriangle 11 hours agoparentprevSometimes you just want the data to do with as you please and don&#x27;t want to bother dealing with relational database overhead (and instead prefer to deal with that overhead yourself).Not really a new idea, just new to SQL databases. Usually if you find yourself needing to dump a whole ton of data, you don&#x27;t use SQL, you use any number of other database solutions that are better suited to that model. So I suppose this is really meant to give you a little bit of that for when you need it. reply ianburrell 12 hours agoparentprevAlso, it is possible to manipulate the joined data. What does this do with a SUM or MAX? Or calculation that involves both tables? reply cmrdporcupine 12 hours agoparentprevReading the abstract... it feels to me like the author doesn&#x27;t know what a relational database is.Chris Date does discuss the concept of nested tuples &#x2F; relation-valued tuples of some kind in his books as an extension to the relational model. But that&#x27;s something else entirely. reply randomdata 12 hours agorootparentMy interpretation is to enable a query to return many relations in order to overcome the high latency associated with most RDBMBes that often prevent using relational databases in a \"theoretically pure\" way. It&#x27;s a hack, but possibly a better hack than the hacks we currently resort to. reply cmrdporcupine 12 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s already a way to return tuples from multiple relations from a single query.Multiple ways in fact. Both unions and joins. reply randomdata 11 hours agorootparentThis is to have multiple relations returned. Traditional unions and joins only see one relation returned.You can pack multiple relations into one relation using unions&#x2F;joins and then unpack it again in the client to ultimately achieve the same effect, which is a workaround that some utilize, but that is really hacky (to be clear, unions and joins are not hacks when used for their intended purpose, but the data packing is).The proposed would be much less hacky - although still far from an ideal database that has no latency constraints that force deviation from what is \"pure\".

What queries return are not tables, but a relation that can be composed of data from one or more tables.What this paper is then saying is \"What if SQL returned something other than a relation?\" That question is being answered by all non-relational DBs being made. An example of one might be a graphdb that could return a graph with nodes, edges and properties thereof.If we want to stay within relational dbs, then we&#x27;re saying that we want a single statement to return multiple relations. That sounds something like GraphQL query to me which is stitching of the relational parts. reply da_chicken 8 hours agoparent> What this paper is then saying is \"What if SQL returned something other than a relation?\"No, I think it&#x27;s closer to \"hey guys, remember that idea that domains don&#x27;t need to be primitive data types?\" reply ako 5 hours agoparentprevYou don’t need graphql for that, modern sql databases that support json documents already support something like this.In Postgres, either return nested json structures, or nested arrays.

The abstract does mention that one downside of this is that the result of the query has to be constructed in memory, resulting in a lot of copying. This is particularly apparent for joins, where some join types can produce much more data than all their input tables combined.I don&#x27;t see how this is \"return something other than a relation\" they are pretty specific about what they mean and what benefits it can bring reply karmakaze 9 hours agorootparent> Our approach has clear semantics, i.e. our extended SQL returns subsets of all tables with only those tuples that would be part of the traditional (single-table) query result set, however without performing any denormalization through joins.Yes, that sounds just like a GraphQL connection result with associated nested connections. I believe that there&#x27;s link deduplication for GraphQL which can also be enabled to avoid the copies.The main difference is avoiding multiple round-trips--one for each table--which within a datacenter network doesn&#x27;t add a whole lot of latency compared to the time serving those queries and some can also be done in parallel. reply js8 13 hours agoprevIIRC this (returning a full database with a schema as a result of a query) has been proposed before in categorical databases, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.categoricaldata.net&#x2F; reply bob1029 12 hours agoprevI feel like we could build something like this with SQLite, application defined functions and in-memory DB pretty quickly.But then I ask myself... Why would I want to do any of this? If I do Database=>sql command=>Database... Don&#x27;t I have to write yet-more-SQL (or something approximating SQL) to get at my final items? I can&#x27;t write a foreach loop over pile-o-tables. Virtually all programming abstractions expect some serial flow and enumerations of types.At some point, you are going to have to map A to B, and I&#x27;d argue adding another database in the middle probably isn&#x27;t strictly headed in the right direction.If you want to select 2 different result shapes, just write 2 different queries. Use some lateral concepts in your programming environment to make the SQL part not suck. If you stand on some weird \"one query only\" principle every time you have to populate a practical view, you are going to have a super rough time with life. reply DanielHB 1 hour agoparentI imagine that this could be useful when you want to perform multiple operations on a subset of the data from the database at the client-side. So you load the RESULTDB to client and then perform subsequent queries client-side and those actually do the JOINsThis could dramatically reduce the load on the database for some applications as well as simplifying some queries that can be awkward to do fully in SQL (some GROUP BYs can get quite complicated to understand)Another useful thing I can see is using this to simplify the creation of edge databases backed by a central database, like imagine creating a RESULTDB \"view\" at the edge using this syntax. reply freeqaz 12 hours agoparentprevMaybe if the client did the JOINs and other logic that were in the query, it would shed load from the upstream DB? That would be helpful for RDBMS which tend to be harder to scale when they are CPU bound.I have seen a lot of services move to microservices and do client-side joins to help distribute load. Maybe there is a way for a DB built around this approach to run each table on a dedicated instance and have each stream the data back async? That would reduce cross-talk between the DBs serving the query and effectively create a client-side JOIN again, but be transparent to the client (if it were handled by the DB driver instead).An interesting thought! reply tlarkworthy 4 hours agoprevThe purpose of this is to support the annoying limitation that results must be a rectangular matrix.

Maybe. The best bet would be scenarios where the wire speed &#x2F; bandwidth &#x2F; system memory of the consuming device are very very limited. In those situations there&#x27;s already an established way of handling it though: cursors.A resultset is, for the most part, highly compressible already (barring scenarios where you&#x27;re just returning blobs, which incidentally this is doing as well), so it&#x27;s not clear to me this is even saving you that much in terms of the \"data duplication\" they&#x27;re discussing. reply shrimpx 11 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s talking about returning a database per se. Their contribution seems to be a new type of query that, instead of using joins to join together results from many tables into a single denormalized output \"table,\" it actually returns multiple output \"tables\" whose rows you can associate together in your code. It&#x27;s kind of a \"normalized join,\" if you will. reply leblancfg 10 hours agorootparentYeah. I&#x27;m imagining e.g. a full database schema at my disposal in the ORM layer, but with only the handful of rows relevant to the logged-in user.Could be useful in many read-heavy scenarios, and would make a default way that skips DB fetches. reply crooked-v 6 hours agorootparentOne thing to note is that with a row-level security implementation like Postgres you can pretty much do this already. For example, if you have a table `users` with appropriate RLS policies, `SELECT * FROM users` will only return the rows that whoever&#x27;s doing the selecting is allowed to see. reply shrimpx 9 hours agorootparentprevThat’s kind of cool.

Inside the JAR there is a collection of SQL files which are executed by Flyway at startup, and we call those files “the schema”. At the same time, we have a configuration option to tell the application which Postgres schema to use within its database, and we actually use that so multiple QA environments can all share the same database. [0] So even in this single app the word “schema” is being used in two different (albeit related) ways. Maybe we just need to accept that language is like that, many words have multiple meanings (sometimes even related meanings) and the context determines which of those meanings applies in any particular case.[0] maybe should have put them in separate catalogs, but ended up going with separate schemas in the same catalog because that was the simplest configuration that met the need reply layoric 12 hours agorootparentAbstractions are just technical terms for analogies, and they commonly break down as you go deeper down the stack ;). reply zer0c00ler 12 hours agorootparentprevMultiple resultsets is a common term.

    "originBody": "a potential sustainable material — Why scientists are making transparent wood The material is being exploited for smartphone screens, insulated windows, and more. Jude Coleman, Knowable Magazine - 12/10/2023, 12:15 PM Enlarge / See-through wood has a number of interesting properties that researchers hope to exploit. WILEY‐VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM reader comments 167 Thirty years ago, a botanist in Germany had a simple wish: to see the inner workings of woody plants without dissecting them. By bleaching away the pigments in plant cells, Siegfried Fink managed to create transparent wood, and he published his technique in a niche wood technology journal. The 1992 paper remained the last word on see-through wood for more than a decade, until a researcher named Lars Berglund stumbled across it. Berglund was inspired by Fink’s discovery, but not for botanical reasons. The materials scientist, who works at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, specializes in polymer composites and was interested in creating a more robust alternative to transparent plastic. And he wasn’t the only one interested in wood’s virtues. Across the ocean, researchers at the University of Maryland were busy on a related goal: harnessing the strength of wood for nontraditional purposes. Now, after years of experiments, the research of these groups is starting to bear fruit. Transparent wood could soon find uses in super-strong screens for smartphones; in soft, glowing light fixtures; and even as structural features, such as color-changing windows. “I truly believe this material has a promising future,” says Qiliang Fu, a wood nanotechnologist at Nanjing Forestry University in China who worked in Berglund’s lab as a graduate student. Wood is made up of countless little vertical channels, like a tight bundle of straws bound together with glue. These tube-shaped cells transport water and nutrients throughout a tree, and when the tree is harvested and the moisture evaporates, pockets of air are left behind. To create see-through wood, scientists first need to modify or get rid of the glue, called lignin, that holds the cell bundles together and provides trunks and branches with most of their earthy brown hues. After bleaching lignin’s color away or otherwise removing it, a milky-white skeleton of hollow cells remains. This skeleton is still opaque, because the cell walls bend light to a different degree than the air in the cell pockets does—a value called a refractive index. Filling the air pockets with a substance like epoxy resin that bends light to a similar degree to the cell walls renders the wood transparent. Advertisement The material the scientists worked with is thin—typically less than a millimeter to around a centimeter thick. But the cells create a sturdy honeycomb structure, and the tiny wood fibers are stronger than the best carbon fibers, says materials scientist Liangbing Hu, who leads the research group working on transparent wood at the University of Maryland in College Park. And with the resin added, transparent wood outperforms plastic and glass: In tests measuring how easily materials fracture or break under pressure, transparent wood came out around three times stronger than transparent plastics like Plexiglass and about 10 times tougher than glass. “The results are amazing, that a piece of wood can be as strong as glass,” says Hu, who highlighted the features of transparent wood in the 2023 Annual Review of Materials Research. The process also works with thicker wood but the view through that substance is hazier because it scatters more light. In their original studies from 2016, Hu and Berglund both found that millimeter-thin sheets of the resin-filled wood skeletons let through 80 to 90 percent of light. As the thickness gets closer to a centimeter, light transmittance drops: Berglund’s group reported that 3.7-millimeter-thick wood—roughly two pennies thick—transmitted only 40 percent of light. The slim profile and strength of the material means it could be a great alternative to products made from thin, easily shattered cuts of plastic or glass, such as display screens. The French company Woodoo, for example, uses a similar lignin-removing process in its wood screens, but leaves a bit of lignin to create a different color aesthetic. The company is tailoring its recyclable, touch-sensitive digital displays for products, including car dashboards and advertising billboards. But most research has centered on transparent wood as an architectural feature, with windows a particularly promising use, says Prodyut Dhar, a biochemical engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi. Transparent wood is a far better insulator than glass, so it could help buildings retain heat or keep it out. Hu and colleagues have also used polyvinyl alcohol, or PVA—a polymer used in glue and food packaging—to infiltrate the wood skeletons, making transparent wood that conducts heat at a rate five times lower than that of glass, the team reported in 2019 in Advanced Functional Materials.

As the article explains, you basically remove the lignin, bleach it, and fill in the spaces with epoxy. What you get is neither as clear as pure epoxy or glass, nor as environmentally friendly as wood since now it&#x27;s more plastic than wood by weight.The material having more flex than glass or plexiglas gives it more impact resistance, so maybe there the phone screen use-case is plausible. But then you have to deal with the visible wood structure, and colors won&#x27;t be as vibrant as they would be with a glass screen. reply shagie 17 hours agoparentA house I lived in for a while had one room where all the interior panes were plexiglass. It wasn&#x27;t that clear (they&#x27;d been significantly scuffed up) and there were some cracks at the edges that had been half heartedly sealed.When asking a neighbor about it, that room was a child&#x27;s room who in their younger years had tantrums and would throw things at the window. After the glass windows were replaced a couple times (once in the winter which was pricy for a \"need to fix this today\"), the parents replaced the windows with a rather durable plexiglass. They didn&#x27;t break again, but they got scuffed up until the child outgrew the tantrums and the house was later sold.Having something that is potentially more energy efficient (lower thermal transmission) and more durable are existing problems that this could provide a solution or a direction for future solutions.(older articles) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;transparent-wood-... and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201006210438&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fpl.f... reply encoderer 14 hours agorootparentLove stories like this that unintentionally show how hard parenting is.

I tried to take a shortcut by using the same wording as the person I replied to but I can see how that made it unclear.The point I meant to make is that if a parent uses that technique to teach lessons in that way it’s likely that the child learns to use that technique themselves and turn it on the parent.Further: If a child learns this type of technique from a parent it can be very hard to stop them from using it. reply idontwantthis 7 hours agorootparentprevIt makes a lot of sense to me.

The most recent ones were some done about 20 years ago, and I&#x27;ve got no intention of replacing them (they work quite well).Glass is recyclable and I wholly advocate its use for bottles and the like.But how old are the windows in your house? When you replace them - will they be recycled or thrown out with other structural construction waste? When your garage door gets replaced (that&#x27;s 30 years old), will you separate out the three one foot square windows from that top panel and send that separately to the recycling center?

One significant difference between the US and European nations is size. Distances in the US between a materials recovery facility and a cullet supplier, or a cullet supplier and a buyer tend to be greater. Transporting glass waste and cullet is costly because of their weight, and those costs can be a deal breaker for some glassmakers and can prevent would-be cullet suppliers from opening processing facilities. For example, in the US, some materials recovery facilities do not recover any glass from their single streams because there are no nearby buyers to make it worthwhile, according to Rue. reply wffurr 11 hours agoparentprevIt’s just another kind of fiberglass, just with wood fibers instead of glass or carbon fiber. reply spenczar5 20 hours agoprevAs a carpenter, the first thing I wonder about is dimensional stability.

For the monomer building blocks, they use a compound called melamine, which contains a ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Under the right conditions, these monomers can grow in two dimensions, forming disks. These disks stack on top of each other, held together by hydrogen bonds between the layers, which make the structure very stable and strong.> “Instead of making a spaghetti-like molecule, we can make a sheet-like molecular plane, where we get molecules to hook themselves together in two dimensions,” Strano says. “This mechanism happens spontaneously in solution, and after we synthesize the material, we can easily spin-coat thin films that are extraordinarily strong.”> Because the material self-assembles in solution, it can be made in large quantities by simply increasing the quantity of the starting materials.

If transparent wood can be produced cheaper than glass, and with less environmental impact than plastic, it&#x27;d be a pretty good contender for this kind of construction.I can also imagine it being great for building energy efficient houses, as any translucent material will allow the interior to absorb heat from the sun, and if it the also doesn&#x27;t leak heat very much, you might be able to reduce the cost of heating somewhat by installing such a roof.

I’m familiar with that from working with glass… different glasses have varying indexes of refraction, and so do liquids. For artistic purposes, it affects how brilliant they look when cut and faceted - for instance lead glass sparkles a lot more than borosilicate, which is why one reason used for the well known traditional style of cut and polished decorative vases and cups. If you put a piece of clear glass into a beaker filled with water, you can typically see the outline of the glass underwater. However, if you tweak the refractive index of the water to match the glass, the glass is rendered invisible. This isn’t super useful but can be employed to distinguish types of glass or create niche artistic effects. reply pkphilip 5 hours agoprevOn a related note, is it possible to get transparent silicone and won&#x27;t that be better for some applications than trying to develop flexible glass-like substances using wood? reply nirav72 17 hours agoprevWhy call it transparent wood?

Notably, pure cellose material has a low coefficient of thermal expansion: (available on sci-hub)Optically Transparent Nanofiber Paper (2009) By Masaya Nogi, Shinichiro Iwamoto, Antonio Norio Nakagaito, and Hiroyuki Yano> \"The thin cellulose nanofibers tend to collapse by capillary action during the evaporation of water, and the deformed condition is fixed by hydrogen bonds that form between hydroxyl groups of the cellulose, thus producing a high-strength material without the use of binders.\"see also https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;am2009122 reply andrewfromx 18 hours agoprevif a transparent tree falls in the woods and lots of people are there does anyone see it? reply iefbr14 19 hours agoprevThey&#x27;d better spend their time and effort on methods for recycling waste plastic instead of cutting down trees for products that will end up in a landfill within 5 years. What they are making this way is ultra fast tree fossilization. reply nine_k 17 hours agoparentOTOH this is how they seal some carbon that will end up dumped in a landfill, and not return into the atmosphere for centuries, if not millennia. reply deadbabe 16 hours agoprevAs a daydreamer, I dream of transparent trees, but don’t really see how they wouldn’t just turn out cloudy and white instead of crystal clear. reply swayvil 20 hours agoprevIs there a wood that&#x27;s already almost transparent?Can we selectively breed it to be more transparent? reply pnutjam 19 hours agoparentThey developed one, but they kept crashing into the tree since it was invisible and they they forgot where it was... reply swayvil 20 hours agoprevMight be easier to colorize and machine too. Like for stained glass type construction.If we could show the grain of the wood a bit, that would be lovely. reply aurizon 12 hours agoprevThey can dissolve cellulose into carbon disulphide and this process allows complete removal of lignin and it is drawn into viscose strands. (rayon) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rayon there are several processes. There may be even better ones to discover. If these clear fibers are embedded in a clear curing resin under vacuum it may be possible to make a very clear pane by matching the refractive index of the viscose strands and the polymer. With a very close match in indices and zero scattering voids in the strands, it should be possible to make a very clear fiber reinforced panel. reply golergka 17 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s such a goldmine of information in old forgotten research papers somewhere. I really hope somebody figures out a way to use LLMs and adjacent tech to extract these gems out of old journals. reply SV_BubbleTime 20 hours agoprevAll of these uses like structural light diffusing beams and screens are all predicated on a production process and even prototypes that no one has seen.A little cart before horse. reply mattmaroon 19 hours agoparentYou realize people make this argument about every brand new technology. “You can’t even make it at scale why are you dreaming up uses for it?”The use cases are the horse, they do the pulling. The cart is the technology. reply Sebb767 20 hours agoparentprevWouldn&#x27;t it be more strange to pour time and money into developing a material where you don&#x27;t have immediate use-cases? reply larschdk 20 hours agoprevI wish it had a less click-baity name than \"transparent wood\". It&#x27;s wood with the lignin replaced with resin through a chemical process. Of course things can be be transparent if you replace them with something else, but then they are no longer wood if you remove the wood! It&#x27;s not the the wood that is transparent, it&#x27;s the resin! Dammit. reply crazygringo 19 hours agoparentMe too. It&#x27;s even worse when they talk about how the \"wood\" is 10 times tougher than glass.No, it&#x27;s not the wood that&#x27;s tougher -- it&#x27;s the epoxy resin it&#x27;s been filled with that&#x27;s tougher, right?Edit: So basically it sounds like the wood matrix is a way to add tensile strength to epoxy to make it more shatter-resistant when it&#x27;s in thin sheets. I guess it&#x27;s tricky semantics whether the main material should be referred to as epoxy&#x2F;resin or as wood, when it&#x27;s their combination.And it seems like we have competing precedents: we refer to \"carbon fiber\" (the wood in this comparison) rather than the resin, but we talk about buildings made of \"concrete\" (the epoxy resin by analogy) rather than the rebar steel within.Thanks to the comments below for helping to explain. reply KMag 19 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s the epoxy resin it&#x27;s been filled with that&#x27;s tougher, right?Your comment seems to suggest that the cellulose left after removing the lignin from the wood isn&#x27;t playing any role. The wood really is playing an integral role.It&#x27;s the epoxy reinforced with the cellulose remaining after lignin removal that&#x27;s tougher. Just a block of cured epoxy resin isn&#x27;t going to be tougher than glass.It&#x27;s a similar case with \"carbon fiber\" items. If you just wrapped a pressure vessel with carbon fiber, it really wouldn&#x27;t help much. It&#x27;s the carbon fiber reinforced resin that&#x27;s strong. That tennis racket wouldn&#x27;t work very well with just carbon fiber or just epoxy resin. reply chongli 19 hours agorootparentYeah, same goes for reinforced concrete. Just concrete or just rebar isn&#x27;t going to work nearly as well. It&#x27;s the two combined that provide the powerful combination of compressive strength and tensile strength. This is the whole rationale behind composite materials: combining different materials with different properties to obtain a gestalt material. reply tomn 18 hours agorootparentprev> Just a block of cured epoxy resin isn&#x27;t going to be tougher than glass.I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure -- toughness has a specific meaning (energy before fracturing), and polymers are generally going to be tougher than glass.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-materials.eng.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;mpsite&#x2F;interactive_charts...I haven&#x27;t dug into it, but note how the article mixes up these terms to make it sound better:> transparent wood came out around three times stronger than transparent plastics like Plexiglass and about 10 times tougher than glass.If you plot that on those graphs it doesn&#x27;t put it anywhere remarkable.edit: This is like trying to sell an electric bike by saying that it&#x27;s three times faster than walking and 1&#x2F;10 the price of a car -- ok, but how does it compare to a pedal bike? It&#x27;s much more obvious when you do it with words that most people understand intuitively. reply ortusdux 19 hours agorootparentprevSome quick numbers from a recent study:Transparent wood tensile strength - 171 MPaBasswood tensile strength - 2.4 MPaPMMA plastic - 75 MPa*Edit - Non-transparent densified wood - 398 MPahttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S13598... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;designerdata.nl&#x2F;materials&#x2F;plastics&#x2F;thermo-plastics&#x2F;p... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matweb.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;datasheet.aspx?matguid=1775e21... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;35807412&#x2F; reply TylerE 17 hours agorootparentBasswood is about the worst wood you could choose. You can damage it with your hands. reply ortusdux 15 hours agorootparentThey needed something porous and compressible, so it sounds like a great choice. reply anamexis 19 hours agorootparentprevWell no, otherwise they would just use sheets of resin. reply jacoblambda 19 hours agorootparentprevEven then, the wood is still stronger. If you research densified wood, it&#x27;s a similar process that uses a heated chemical bath to remove the lignin but then instead of replacing it with resin, they compress the wood at temperature. It provides strengths comparable to steel by weight without adding new material to it. reply FearNotDaniel 18 hours agorootparentprevI think the key word here, somewhat buried in the article, is \"sustainability\". If you can convince someone that what you&#x27;re selling is really wood, then you get your brownie points for being green. Epoxy resin doesn&#x27;t sound quite so sexy and sustainable in a planet-conscious marketplace. reply fluoridation 19 hours agoparentprevWell, the names things have should at least give you a hint about what they are. \"Transparent wood\" doesn&#x27;t tell you everything about what the material is, but it does tell you part of where it comes from (trees) and it tells you that it&#x27;s transparent. That&#x27;s enough for a person to have a vague notion of what it looks like without having ever seen it, even if they still don&#x27;t know what it is. Conversely, if we were to refer to it by a more precise description such as \"structure of cellulose tubules held together by a polymer and disposed in an axially optically transparent manner\", that would tell you more about what the material is made of, but practically nothing about what it looks like and why it&#x27;s interesting. reply mmanfrin 19 hours agoparentprevIIRC it&#x27;s not replacing the lignin -- the lignin are the tubes that give wood rigidity. This process removes what is inside the lignin with resin. reply veddox 18 hours agorootparentThe tubes are called xylem and phloem. Lignin is one biopolymer that is used in their construction, but it&#x27;s not the only one (cellulose is even more important) - and you shouldn&#x27;t confuse the building material with the structure.Also, the article specifically says that these processes will usually remove the lignin to make the result transparent. reply geocrasher 20 hours agoprev [–] The applications for transparent wood are clear. reply actionfromafar 20 hours agoparentI think we can frame the success of transparent wood as dependent on the future of transparent aluminum remaining murky. reply skapadia 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m so happy it didn&#x27;t take long for a \"transparent aluminum\" reference to be made.

I&#x27;m from upstate NY and I remember when it got legalized I didn&#x27;t think much about it. Let people do what they want. I won&#x27;t play because I don&#x27;t gamble.Then when I was hope for the holidays and every man I knew from my home town that was near my age was doing it. They&#x27;d watch a basketball game only to see if their 8 leg parlay would hit. Whatever app they were using even listed your all time wins&#x2F;loses (probably legally required) and _all_ of them had all time loses over $500 and it had only been legalized a few months prior.It&#x27;s just a drain on the average person, the same was cigarettes are. I struggle with the freedom for personal choice to do what you want vs the collective better situation we get to form for ourselves as a society by banning these things, but I think I&#x27;m just leaning more towards the latter now. On the other hand, I think weed and alcohol should be legal, despite it affecting people&#x27;s lives in negative ways, but the majority if their users are completely normal people.This is such a tricky subject to me and I guess I&#x27;ll just stop rambling now, but I am interested in what other people thing about societal restriction for a better group vs personal freedoms. reply donmcronald 16 hours agoparent> I struggle with the freedom for personal choice to do what you want vs the collective better situation we get to form for ourselves as a society by banning these things, but I think I&#x27;m just leaning more towards the latter now.I am 100% in favor of banning sports betting. The thing that makes it obvious for me is the \"losers only\" policy all of the sports betting sites have. If you consistently win by taking advantage of incorrectly priced odds you&#x27;ll be banned.All it takes is watching a few YouTube videos with sharps (aka winning bettors) or arbitrage bettors and you can see the scam. If you consistently lose, welcome aboard! If you consistently win, GTFO!IMO, that makes it predatory. At a minimum, they should be forced to accept all bets and banning someone for winning should be illegal. reply soupfordummies 15 hours agorootparentVery similar to card-counting at blackjack. You’re literally just using your brain to improve your odds. Even perfect conditions will only net the player a very slim edge against the casino but if the player is suspected of doing it they are no longer allowed to wager. reply dev_tty01 15 hours agorootparentprevYou are correct. There is no gambling establishment or app that allows consistent winners to continue playing. Might not be rigged in the play itself, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be if you are allowed to kick out the winners. reply costco 12 hours agorootparentThey exist, it&#x27;s just a different business model (high volume, low margin) that&#x27;s not compatible with massive TV advertising campaigns, large sign up bonuses, etc. See Pinnacle.Alternatively, there&#x27;s the exchange model a la Betfair where you let the users take the risk and merely collect a fee. You can also squeeze but not ban consistent winners with a \"premium charge.\" Interstate betting outside of horse racing is of questionable legality and I don&#x27;t think that model was too popular when it was tried in America so it doesn&#x27;t really exist here.It&#x27;s not even clear that models in which winners aren&#x27;t removed are more fair or better for the average person. Winners in betting on horses aren&#x27;t banned. Yet total horse racing handle in the US has been in decline for almost 2 decades at this point. Most of the volume at this point is just algorithms competing with each other for some infinitesimally small edge. Lots of frustration among the humans with last second odds changes due to automated wagering. Not only that, traditionally under parimutuel betting the track take is 15-20%, but because racetracks want to raise volume they will give rebates of up to around half that to high volume (read: robot) bettors. Any sort of exchange model will eventually devolve into something like this.Given that the supermajority of people will lose money betting and are betting for the thrill of it, should the interests of winners even be considered from a policy perspective? reply nostromo 15 hours agorootparentprevThe answer isn&#x27;t banning it, it&#x27;s some basic regulation of the industry.For example, look how well the Nevada Gaming Control Board keeps Vegas casinos honest.And the casinos welcome it too -- because it shows that Vegas is a pretty fair place to gamble. You will likely lose money, but you&#x27;ll lose it fair and square. reply Nullabillity 14 hours agorootparentWhat? Casinos are infamous for having the same policy. reply datavirtue 15 hours agorootparentprevWe can keep it legal but just make everyone&#x27;s wins and losses public record. Full accounting. There&#x27;s your wet blanket, and people get to keep their freedom. reply InitialLastName 16 hours agoparentprevAs a counterpoint, I know plenty of people who willingly spend more than $500 on entertainment over a few months.I think the comparison to alcohol is an apt one: we&#x27;ve seen from previous ban attempts that rather than deter people from an activity the ban risks driving people to the black market, empowering those willing to operate illegally, removing the capacity for regulation or legal recourse (exposing partakers to grievous downside risks from product perspectives, such as contaminated liquor and loan sharks) and, ultimately, requiring more intrusion of law enforcement processes on the lives of every-day people. reply JKCalhoun 16 hours agorootparentThen you keep it legal but regulate the shit out of it. As the OP suggested, one step might be to force the betting houses to take all comers — also force them to indicate bettor losses compared to bettor gains, etc. reply lstodd 15 hours agorootparent> but regulate the shit out of it.So like a ban, but just a bit less so? This will bring the same ill effects, but a bit less so. What it the win then? reply rpgbr 14 hours agorootparentIn Brazil, tobacco is heavily regulated. They can’t advertise on TV and they must show scary health alerts on the back of their packages, for example.Since government started this trend, in end of 80s, tobacco usage is in free fall, as shown by this Brazilian Cancer Institute chart: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.br&#x2F;inca&#x2F;pt-br&#x2F;assuntos&#x2F;gestor-e-profissional... reply dangus 15 hours agorootparentprev“A bit less so” is the point.Under this logic you’re using, there’s no point to having speed limits on roadways or seatbelts and safety devices in cars. If we can never eliminate car crash deaths, why bother with all those regulations?Lower number of bad thing is better than higher number of bad thing.This is known to be effective with cigarettes. Higher taxes reduce usage. Less advertising reduces usage. Advertising induces demand that would not otherwise exist. reply s1artibartfast 15 hours agorootparentI think it is pretty different.The moral justification for speed limits is risks to others on shared roads, not oneself. You can drive as fast as you want on a private track. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 7 hours agorootparentSeat belt law might be a better analogy, though there is always the risk of becoming a projectile when you don’t wear one that can injure others, so even that’s not a perfect one. reply s1artibartfast 7 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s better, and still legal to ignore on private property.There was a lot of anger and discussion about public seat belt laws for the reasons you said. reply dangus 7 hours agorootparentprevI think the family members of frequent gamblers might argue against the idea that it’s got no negative externalities to others. reply Consultant32452 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s important to protect the r̶i̶c̶h̶ ̶i̶n̶c̶u̶m̶b̶e̶n̶t̶s̶ public from c̶o̶m̶p̶e̶t̶i̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ predators. reply julianeon 16 hours agorootparentprevIt does seem like legalization made it qualitatively worse. To quote the parent comment:> Then when I was home for the holidays every man I knew from my home town that was near my age was doing it.From how he&#x27;s describing it, this sounds like a big change. I&#x27;m also getting the sense that maybe 1 in 100 guys did it before, and it&#x27;s dropping to like 1 in 10. I think the reason is that drugs can be bought in cash, but bettors depend on credit cards, and when that rail was legalized, the floodgates opened. reply beAbU 15 hours agorootparentprevMy government banned cigarettes and alcohol during lockdown (don&#x27;t ask).And the only thing it achieved was they missed out on billions in sin tax revenue during that time. I have a few friends and family in the retail and hospitality space, and all of them were trading under the table.Our local ice cream van (who remained operational because they were deemed \"essential retail\") pivoted to a mobile liquor store overnight. reply whaleofatw2022 14 hours agorootparentI vaguely get the ban.Cigarettes and alcohol are probably high on the list of things people &#x27;go out for a pack of&#x27;. Doubly so when there&#x27;s fuck all to do. Banning them would theoretically lower some spread. reply Nasrudith 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen the exact opposite practiced for alcohol: declaring liquor stores essential because DTs are no joke and they don&#x27;t want alcoholics in withdraw taking up hospital beds. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 7 hours agorootparentWas a legitimate risk early on in COVID and why many places declared them essential businesses, which I am guessing is also what you are referencing without being explicit about it reply faeriechangling 13 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not a risk, it’s a certainty, and I ask:So what?We saw life under criminalized gambling. There was more loan sharking and kneecap breaking going on but overall gambling happened on a much smaller scale than it did under legalization. The people I see hurt by gambling only seems to have skyrocketed to me since legalization. The legal for-profit gambling industry does more harm than the gangsters ever did.Just because alcohol criminalization isn’t worth it doesn’t mean we have to throw away criminalization as a tool in the toolbox. reply tech_ken 15 hours agorootparentprevI think the economics of a physical drug substance and gambling are different enough that it’s actually un-apt to draw a comparison between sports betting and alcohol prohibition. Indeed I think it&#x27;s actually highly misleading to extrapolate the harms caused by alcohol&#x2F;drug prohibition to the prohibition on gambling. Caveat: this is all armchair speculation, I have no expertise or research on the matter.In the case of black market gambling it seems much easier to keep everything within my direct control, thereby limiting the risk of getting a bad product. I can make a wager or play a poker game with my buddy without taking on virtually any “undue” risk (aside the risk I’m taking on intentionally) because he’s my friend and I know he’s not going to kneecap me if I can’t pay. The chain of trust only needs one link, and it’s an easy one to verify. Some people clearly do go farther, and this isn’t to say that large-scale illegal betting doesn’t exist, but it seems like the majority of recreational gambling demand is met by this type of direct person-person transaction where trust is easy-ish to establish or enforce. In this case banning betting has limited harms, because for most people the black-market is relatively low-risk. Indeed legalizing it, and thus allowing big players into the game, actually seems less safe to me. A friendly poker game on Friday nights is going to self-regulate: nobody&#x27;s too sharp, everyone has roughly equivalent cash reserves, and my friends are probably going to cut me off if it seems like I&#x27;m developing an addiction. In the long-run I&#x27;m unlikely to find myself too deep in the hole. Compare this to sports betting with DraftKings. I&#x27;m against an odds-maker who&#x27;s WAY savvier, has much deeper reserves than I do, and is incentivized to keep me playing at almost any cost.

Unlike purchasing gambling services, buying ex. cocaine from the same buddy requires a much longer chain of trust, because of the manufacture and distribution processes involved. Even if I trust my buddy not to sell me fentanyl, I have to trust his dealer, and his dealer’s dealer, and the dealer’s dealer’s supply, etc. In this case I very much want lots of regulation ensuring the product isn’t contaminated, contains what it’s supposed to, etc. Legalizing just takes the already-existing supply chain and big players and moves them under government control. In this case the legalized version is far safer than the black market equivalent.W&#x2F;r&#x2F;t legal enforcement side of things the differences seem similar. A small bet between friends is basically impossible to prosecute. It’s only the really big organized stuff that is even possible to detect, legally. On the other hand, a small amount of personal cannabis is very easy to detect and prosecute, often easier than the professional distribution network. reply korse 15 hours agorootparentYou make an interesting point.

This was not long ago.This gets mighty close to conspiracy territory, but I think that the current gambling wave is just a well made business play by the same people who were running the game previously.Kind of like the cartel getting tired of dealing with interdiction and getting into the pharma business (which I don&#x27;t think is a thing btw). reply tech_ken 15 hours agorootparentFor sure.

In theory, I like the idea of just letting people make their own decisions, and let the consequences fall where they lie.

Legalizing drugs and gambling is important for cutting off the flow of money and social legitimacy to criminal operations, but the \"nice\" thing (from a marketing perspective) about addictive substances and activities is you don&#x27;t need to try hard to sell them. For users, even addicts, the bar set by having to deal with black markets is so low that we can get them out of the streets with the truly blandest, unenticing solutions -- plain black and white boxes, black and white screens, beige halls.

It&#x27;s not right to say 500 dollars of losses over six months is a drain on the average person, there may be unpriced benefit to them you don&#x27;t see. For example, I buy 20 dollars of lotto tickets whenever the prize is over 50 million.

If you look at it from the perspective of the cost to society (which I think it should), it seems pretty clearly to me to be correct. The dollar cost to the consumer is less (remember when comparing numbers that the headline for gambling is the amount wagered, of which only a minority is actually lost, vs. for alcohol it&#x27;s what&#x27;s spent, which is all lost). Add to that the amount we have to spend on Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid treatment for issues caused by alcohol, and in my view it&#x27;s very tough to say that it&#x27;s reasonable for alcohol to be legal but sports betting should not.> On the other hand, I think weed and alcohol should be legal, despite it affecting people&#x27;s lives in negative ways, but the majority if their users are completely normal people.I do want to address this point - I don&#x27;t think the majority of their users being normal is a good metric.

I fear that if lawmakers started trying to pin down what in videogames was gambling and what wasn&#x27;t, especially to crack down on \"loot crates\", who knows where they&#x27;d stop.

The big budget games don&#x27;t have their big budgets in 2023 without their parent companies out whale hunting with some terrible mobile game or another. There are more players on mobile devices spending more money than anywhere else in videogames.)Publishing odds and making sure that \"real money can go in, but real money can&#x27;t come out\" were the contest laws that in part came out of compromises when pinball prohibition ended. They seem to be the best regulations we&#x27;ve come up with so far.

The government has wisely cracked down on FBOTs, the worst part of that model that appeared after sports betting moved online. The culture that exists today (as this industry disappears) is nothing to do with what it was (and, btw, the move online has seen the vig go down by something like 90%...so that isn&#x27;t bad either).The really weird one is casinos in the US: until Adelson died, both parties largest donors were the casino industry...now it just the Dems. You have zero harm protection, zero regulations, and massive levels of political corruption.In the UK, these companies pay lots of tax, they invest heavily in technology, and until last year were the only people funding gambling addiction...the government, which runs the healthcare system, refused to do so.The rate of harm from online gambling is usually under 1% and highest in markets that are either overregulated (i.e. Hong Kong) or unregulated (i.e. US). You \"lose\" every time you go to the cinema, buy food, do anything by your terms is a loss. You want to gamble on sports, someone will take your bet, what is the issue? Casino&#x2F;table games are pointless, but this isn&#x27;t what \"betting parlors\" are and this isn&#x27;t the culture in Europe which skews heavily towards sports betting, which is relatively low-harm.Again, look at the US: crypto, zero-day options, etc. There is value in having an outlet, because people are going to do this stuff whether it is legal or not. reply _factor 16 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t have to get rid of it, just treat as what it is.. a negative addiction pattern.

The harm rates are stable across countries because gambling addiction is a real addiction, it occurs regardless of governmental structure (but serious harm can be prevented by effective regulation, HK is an example of a country where overregulation has led to massive harm).It didn&#x27;t use to be manageable before, you probably just didn&#x27;t hear of it happening. Remember online poker used to be widespread. Illegal sports betting was very widespread. Someone \"irresponsibly\" losing money isn&#x27;t the same thing as an addiction either (if you do research into why people get addicted to gambling, you will find out that it isn&#x27;t about money, it is often about sensory experiences which sports betting does not provide). reply Symbiote 12 hours agorootparentprevYou sound like a politician defending gambling after receiving a large donation from 888, or else an employee at a betting company. reply skippyboxedhero 11 hours agorootparentThe irony being that regulation basically removes this avenue.

Both of which make it much easier to develop a gambling addiction, and much harder for and addict to stop gambling.Sports betting also has the unique issue of introducing corruption into sports. A league like the NFL has a huge number of players, coaches, referees, and league staff, all of whom can influence the outcome of a game, and all of whom are potentially susceptible to bribes.
