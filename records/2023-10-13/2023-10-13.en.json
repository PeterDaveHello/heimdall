Ink Detection FAQ History Livestream Kaggle Twitter Discord Substack First word discovered in unopened Herculaneum scroll by 21yo computer science student Vesuvius Challenge $700,000 Grand Prize “now definitely achievable” October 12th, 2023 This handwriting has been hidden for 2000 years. Join our livestream today (Oct 12th) at 4:00pm EDT. Code is on Github: Luke, Youssef. The Herculaneum papyri, ancient scrolls housed in the library of a private villa near Pompeii, were buried and carbonized by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. For almost 2,000 years, this lone surviving library from antiquity was buried underground under 20 meters of volcanic mud. In the 1700s, they were excavated, and while they were in some ways preserved by the eruption, they were so fragile that they would turn to dust if mishandled. How do you read a scroll you can’t open? For hundreds of years, this question went unanswered. That is until Luke Farritor, a contestant of the Vesuvius Challenge, became the first person in two millennia to see an entire word from within an unopened scroll this August. For that, we are thrilled to award Luke a $40,000 First Letters Prize, which required contestants to find at least 10 letters in a 4 cm2 area in a scroll. Luke Farritor’s First Letters Prize submission. Luke holding the campfire scroll at EduceLab. Shortly after that, another contestant, Youssef Nader, independently discovered the same word in the same area, with even clearer results — winning the second place prize of $10,000. Youssef’s even clearer submission. Youssef’s happy face on a call. These breakthroughs were both inspired by contestant Casey Handmer, who was the first person to find substantial, convincing evidence of ink within the unopened scrolls, as explained in his blog post and this video. His insights led directly to Luke’s discovery, as well as an improved understanding of the ink signal. We’re awarding him a $10,000 First Ink Prize. Congratulations to Casey, Luke, and Youssef! So how did we get here, and how do these models work? Let’s start with a little history. EduceLab scans Our story starts in 2019, when professor Brent Seales at the University of Kentucky’s EduceLab imaged Herculaneum scrolls in a particle accelerator, generating 3D CT-scans at resolutions as high as 4 µm. Professor Seales and team scanning at the particle accelerator. His team also scanned and photographed detached scroll fragments bearing visible ink, thus providing a ground truth dataset. Training a machine learning model on the ground truth data from the detached fragments. From Stephen Parsons’ PhD dissertation. Professor Seales’ graduate student, Stephen Parsons, worked on detecting ink from the CT-scans using machine learning models and found success with the detached fragments. That success caught the eye of tech entrepreneurs Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, who started the Vesuvius Challenge to accelerate this progress. They launched an open competition March of 2023, and — alongside a $700,000 Grand Prize — awarded several smaller prizes for the development of open source tools and techniques. Early in the summer, a small team of annotators (the “segmentation team”) joined our effort. They began mapping the 3D structure of the scroll using tools initially built by EduceLab and improved by our community. By July we had segmented and “virtually flattened” hundreds of cm2 of papyrus. Progress of mapping the scrolls, in area (cm²), from the Segment Directory spreadsheet. Casey’s crackle pattern In early August, contestant Casey Handmer, an ex-JPL startup founder and polymath, wrote a blog post about his discovery of a “crackle pattern” that looks like ink. Casey found the pattern by staring at the segmented CT scans for hours on end. This was a major and surprising discovery. Stephen Parsons had seen direct evidence of ink in detached fragments before, but not yet in the scrolls. Casey was the first person in 2,000 years to find ink — and a letter — inside an unopened scroll. Left: Ink visible as cracked texture. Right: annotation showing ink location. It could be a “pi” or the bottom of a capital “eta”. From Casey’s blog post. Luke Farritor’s model After this discovery, several contestants looked for more crackle, but it seemed quite rare. Luke Farritor, a college student and SpaceX summer intern working at Starbase, had heard about the Vesuvius Challenge from Dwarkesh Patel’s podcast interview with Nat. He saw Casey’s crackle pattern being discussed in the Discord, and began spending his evenings and late nights training a machine learning model on the crackle pattern. With each new crackle found, the model improved, revealing more crackle in the scroll — a cycle of discovery and refinement. He found a few dozen ink strokes — and some complete letters — that could be labeled and used as training data. Left: cracked ink visible against papyrus fiber background. Right: Resulting binary ink label. Before long, the model was unveiling traces of crackle invisible to his own eye. Soon, these traces began to form letters and hints of actual words. Luke then made a submission to our First Letters Prize, which required contestants to find at least 10 letters in a 4 cm2 area. This was his first submission: Luke’s first submission, faintly showing the word ΠΟΡΦΥΡΑϹ (porphyras). When professor Seales showed this image to our team of papyrologists, scholars specializing in works on papyrus, they gasped: they could immediately read the word “porphyras,” despite the letters being faint. After thorough technical review, we sent a newer version of his picture to the panel of papyrologists. Independently and unanimously, they annotated 13 letters, albeit with varying levels of confidence: Each square represents one review. Green: over 80% confidence. Yellow: 50-80% confidence. Red: under 50% confidence. Indeed, the word held up to scrutiny. “Porphyras” is an exciting word: it means “purple” and is quite rare in ancient texts. One papyrologist noted: “The sequence πορφυ̣ρ̣ας̣ may be πορφύ̣ρ̣ας̣ (noun, purple dye or cloths of purple) or πορφυ̣ρ̣ᾶς̣(adjective, purple). Due to the lack of context it is not possible to exclude πορφύ̣ρ̣α ς̣κ[ or πορφυ̣ρ̣ᾶ ς̣κ[.” If you’re trying to find these letters in the image, keep in mind that our modern characters look a little bit different. The letters in this ancient script look more like this: ΠΟΡΦΥΡΑϹ. Note that texts from this time didn’t use spaces, making it harder to determine word boundaries. Luke’s First Letters Prize submission is available now on GitHub. Luke’s reaction when we told him he won the prize a few days ago. Youssef’s discovery Meanwhile, another contestant, Youssef Nader, an Egyptian biorobotics grad student in Berlin, pursued a different approach. Motivated by Casey and Luke’s findings, he sifted through the winning entries of the Ink Detection prize on Kaggle — which was focused on improving Stephen Parsons’ approach of machine learning in detached fragments. He used a domain transfer technique to adapt these models to the scrolls: unsupervised pretraining on the scroll data, followed by fine-tuning on the fragment labels. One of the detached fragments with known ground truth being scanned at the particle accelerator. He submitted his idea for an “Ink Detection Followup Prize” and won a small prize. The idea seemed promising, but as far as we knew, that was that. Several weeks later, Youssef made his own submission to the First Letters prize. He had seen Luke’s early results which had been shared on Twitter and Discord and decided to focus on the same area within the scroll. With this modified model from the Kaggle competition, he managed to find some letters, though entirely without relying on Casey’s method of manually looking for crackle. He then annotated what looked like letter shapes to the label data. Youssef’s earliest image. His first set of hypothesized ink labels. He repeated this pseudo-labeling iteratively, resulting in speculative labels for a number of segments within the scroll. Models trained on these labels were then capable of detecting ink from within the scroll and the training data from the detached scroll fragments were ultimately removed. The final models trained solely on internal scroll segments resulted in the image below, securing Youssef the prize. Youssef’s final submission. This time, the papyrologists agreed more strongly about the letters. They even began speculating on possible words above (ανυοντα / ANYONTA, “achieving”) and below (ομοιων / OMOIωN, “similar”). If these words are indeed what we think they are, this papyrus scroll likely contains an entirely new text, unseen by the modern world. Youssef’s First Letters Prize submission is available now on GitHub. Why were we successful? There were many contributions from different people in the critical path for these discoveries. Our combination of competition and open source (through “progress prizes”) seems to work! To highlight a few key contributions: Youssef used a model from the Kaggle competition and was inspired by Luke’s results to look in the same area. Luke’s search for crackle was directly inspired by Casey’s work. Casey was able to look through many sheets of papyrus because our segmentation team had mapped out hundreds of cm2. The segmentation team was able to map out a lot of papyrus because of tooling built by contestants who worked on “Segmentation Tooling Prizes” (work by Julian Schilliger, Chuck, Yao Hsiao, and many others). The segmentation tooling advances were possible because contestants built on top of existing open source tools by professor Seales’ team (work by Seth Parker, Stephen Parsons, and many others). And of course, the contest itself wouldn’t have been possible without the foundation that Dr. Seales and his team, along with their funders, have laid out and continue to support. Looking back at what got us to this point, it seems that almost every single thing we did in running this contest so far has been load-bearing. We’re not quite sure what to make of this! Perhaps that progress is more fragile and success is more contingent than it often seems in retrospect. What’s next? The segmentation team and contestants continue to make progress, and a few days ago Youssef’s model generated a new image of shocking clarity and size: Youssef’s latest image (variant), from segments 20230929220924 and 20231005123333. In this image you can clearly see four and a half columns of text, separated by margins. Many more letters are now visible, though not all are immediately legible. Our papyrological team is working hard to further investigate this result, and we’ll have updates on this soon. These advancements demonstrate that the $700,000 Grand Prize is within reach. Our optimism is at an all time high. Now is the best time to get involved! Join our vibrant Discord community, sign up to receive newsletters via Substack, or follow @scrollprize on X. To get started, download some data, walk through some of our tutorials, and catch up on the progress made by contestants by looking at the prize winners and community tools. Will you be the one unlocking the knowledge in hundreds of scrolls — doubling the amount of texts from antiquity — and potentially thousands more that are yet to be excavated, becoming the last hero of the Roman Empire and winning $700,000 while you’re at it?

It is incredible and beyond conception — I had a light scattering in my education, but only later and recently have I discovered how incredible it can be.Suggested Reading for beginners:* Life of Pythagoras, by Iamblichus* The Golden Ass, by Apuleius of Numenia (specifically, translation by Robert Graves)* Life of Alexander by Plutarch* Education of Cyrus by Xenophon* Parmenides by PlatoAlso, I have found SHWEP.net to be invaluable for a gentle yet rigorous guide through many classics, though it takes an esoteric bent (which I love) reply bb123 50 minutes agoparent> It is incredible and beyond conceptionCould you elaborate a little bit about what you think gives it these qualities? I&#x27;ve dabbled in some classical literature before but I&#x27;ve always found them to be very difficult reads, so I rarely have the motivation to finish them. I am wondering if there is something I am missing about the genre. reply atomicnature 2 hours agoparentprevLife of Pythagoras was super influential to my life. I was very inspired by the way Pythagoras lived his life - a 100% commitment to finding out what is true, travelling all over the world amassing knowledge&#x2F;practices&#x2F;skills through humility, trying so many things out and finally spending so much of his life teaching. Pythagoras was probably the greatest philosopher ever. I also recommend reading about Archytas, one of his spiritual descendants, his thoughts on math, mechanics, music, learning and philosophy are amazing. reply bonoboTP 9 minutes agorootparentBut he got scared of sqrt(2). reply bambax 2 hours agoparentprevAnd now the size of the corpus may be about to explode!

Unfortunately such crackle texture isn&#x27;t visible, at least by eye, on most of the papyrus. Probably it&#x27;s only that visible where the ink was very thick. You can easily see the difference in texture in this electron microscope image [1] (far higher resolution than the CT scans) but especially on the very edge of the inked area (the narrow strip in the left image; I think the whole right image is inked) where the ink was pushed to. I&#x27;m surprised the crackle was discovered only after the Kaggle Ink Detection contest. Looking at the CT-scanned fragments with infrared ground truths, which were used in the Kaggle contest, Casey Handmer wrote [2]:> The ongoing apparent failure of deep-learning based ink detection based on the fragments indicated to me that direct inspection of the actual data would be more fruitful, as it has been here.> ...> I found similar “cracked mud” and “flake” textures corresponding to known character ink, but only for perhaps 10% of the known characters. It’s been a long day, I can probably find more on closer inspection, but that does make one wonder about automated ink detection and what that is seeing.These new images are much better than I hoped for, but still only in one small area, so I&#x27;m still pessimistic about more than an odd sentence being readable.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrollprize.org&#x2F;img&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;sem.png[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caseyhandmer.wordpress.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;reading-ancien... reply tysam_and 7 hours agoparentI actually participated in the challenge for a little while and this was the approach I took before I dropped out to do a few other things.However, what I did was a bit different -- instead of looking for a crackle, I surmised that that &#x27;crackling&#x27; effect actually is just of course slices of the data over different rifts in the parchment, and that the data of the ink lay on the manifold of that crackling and bending.It would not be as clear to the human eye for all of the letters, I think, as there are many, many, many layers in the scanned image, and you can only start to see a pattern emerge over time as you cycle through the images.I was working on code that minimized an optimization function that was basically the total variance loss if I recall correctly, where it just interpolated each pixel column up and down bilinearly to &#x27;align&#x27; the blocks of the image so that the crackle texture was flattened.From there I planned on using a rather optimized convolutional network on the &#x27;flattened&#x27; image, which can I think be done rather efficiently as if you look at a cross section of the scroll you can see where it&#x27;s like a tree in that the pinching and such seems to be somewhat locally consistent, so you might be able to get away with some interpolation.I should probably share the code if this is of interest to anyone, since I&#x27;m not pursuing the competition at the moment.Also, this is why I did not buy into 3D convolutions for this, at least. Ink that has been laid and dried should follow a semi-predictable pattern that a 2D convolution can detect, I do not know if a 3D convolution really brings us anything, as the invariances we desire can be structured up front more easily.If there is interest in the code, let me know and I can do a little digging, otherwise, it is a fun challenge, for sure. reply hpschrei 2 hours agorootparentI, for one, would be interested in the code. reply sillysaurusx 19 hours agoprevSee also Nat’s twitter announcement: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;natfriedman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1712470683207532906$700k is a life changing amount of money.

It was easier to scrape the surface clean than to make a new tablet.You&#x27;d save any tablets you have, and might wait until you need it to scrape it clean.In Mesopotamia there was a period where it was fashionable to use a more rare softer red clay on top of the white clay. Your stylus would cut through the top layer leaving nice white letters on a red background. It made it easier to scrape clean and reuse, but much less durable over time. reply jdminhbg 17 hours agorootparentYes, the clay tablets were used over and over. The ones that are preserved have what was written on them when they were fired, accidentally, by being in a building that was destroyed by fire. reply cheese_van 10 hours agorootparentYeah, and a large number of clay tablets found were training tablets. At any given time, there may have been more students working on properly learning the mechanics of writing on tablets then tablets in circulation so a surprising number of what is found is, basically homework, or apprentice practice. reply daveevad 6 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s fascinating to this lay clay tablet thinker.

Purple cloth was extremely rare and expensive, and it was the colour worn by the Emperors. Indeed, it eventually became a capital crime for people outside the Emperor&#x27;s family to wear it.

Wine can be described as purple. reply stevula 6 hours agorootparentI see “oiōn” (οιων), not “oino” (οινο or οινω). I don’t see how it could be read as “wine”. οιων could be several things off the top of my head:1. the beginning of some form of of οἰωνός “omen”2. genitive plural of οἶς, meaning “of sheep”3. a genitive plural of some other word with a stem ending in -οι-, but with the beginning of the word missing. For example, the demonstrative τοίων “of such”, relative οἵων “of which”, or ποίων “of a certain kind”. Or, as speculated in the article, ὁμοίων “same”.The 3rd option seems most likely to me without any further context. ὁμοίων seems especially plausible since the preceding characters do resemble \"ΟΜ\". reply OfSanguineFire 14 hours agorootparentprevWhile modern people make that connection, that is culturally dependent. The color terms available to speakers of a language, and what objects those terms can be associated with, change over time. In the case of the Greek word for \"purple\", it was connected to a dye and therefore used for clothing, but one shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be used for wine. reply fsckboy 12 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wine-dark_sea_(Homer)\"Wine-dark sea is a traditional English translation of oînops póntos (οἶνοψ πόντος, IPA: &#x2F;ôi̯.nops pón.tos&#x2F;), from oînos (οἶνος, \"wine\") + óps (ὄψ, \"eye; face\"), a Homeric epithet. A literal translation is \"wine-face sea\" (wine-faced, wine-eyed). It is attested five times in the Iliad and twelve times in the Odyssey[1] often to describe rough, stormy seas. The only other use of oînops in the works of Homer is for oxen, for which is it used once in the Iliad and once in the Odyssey, where it describes a reddish colour.

The comment by fsckboy, which was already there when you commented, gets it. For the Greeks, the connotation of wine was different than purple, purple was not a basic color term in that stage of the language, and πορφυρός was used only in the context of purple clothing and the dye used to make it. reply thaumasiotes 7 hours agorootparentprevOnly if you assume that whoever scribed the scroll wasn&#x27;t too concerned about what order the letters in a word should be written in.The image is annotated OIWN and the article tentatively identifies the word as OMOIWN, meaning \"similar\". reply londons_explore 12 hours agorootparentprevwine stains are decidedly more purple than the wine they came from too. reply dataflow 16 hours agoparentprev> $700k is a life changing amount of moneyProbably ~half of that will go to taxes? reply thrway63245 15 hours agorootparentNot sure why this is downvoted.

Did that money change your life then? In that case your entire life was (by definition!) the same as before; only your retirement account ended with a higher balance than it would&#x27;ve otherwise. The only thing that changed was your expectation for the future, not your reality.And you can imagine other situations where the money ends up not changing your life in any significant way... like the money getting stolen before you use it, creditors taking it during bankruptcy, hyperinflation rendering it effectively worthless, etc.Point being, as long as the money hasn&#x27;t actually changed anything in your life, it... hasn&#x27;t been life-changing.

Read the OP describing the iterative process of hand-annotation guided by output of a model, then retraining the model with the additional data, it&#x27;s a fascinating technique!

The short of it is there are several potentially common works possibly in the library that could directly prove or disprove what is found in the New Testament and the predicates of Rabbinic Judaism as established at the Council of Jamnia.We could be seeing the beginning of conclusive proof that invalidates the narratives of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam by the end of the year.The Vesuvius Challenge isn&#x27;t just an interesting contest in the machine learning realm; it&#x27;s a groundbreaking endeavor that could redefine our understanding of the humanities if successful. The opportunity to digitally unroll and read the Herculaneum Papyri could offer unprecedented insights into ancient civilizations and the total feedstock of civilization today. This is not merely about filling in some historical gaps; it’s about fundamentally altering how we understand antiquity and, by extension, our own intellectual heritage.The loss of the Library of Alexandria has long been considered a \"dark age\" event for intellectual progress. Now, consider the Herculaneum library—a collection of papyri from a villa once owned by Julius Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law, carbonized but preserved by the Vesuvius eruption in 79 AD. Hundreds of these scrolls are unreadable because their carbon-based ink blends in with the carbonized papyrus, and thus are invisible to conventional imaging techniques. Yet, these scrolls are quite possibly on the cusp of revelation.Recent developments have introduced machine learning and high-resolution X-ray scans as methods for reading these \"unreadable\" scrolls. What texts do they contain? Treatises on science and philosophy? The lost books of Livy? The epic cycle? Governmental policies like the Twelve Tables? It’s a tantalizing question because whatever is locked in those scrolls could be an unfiltered look at the Roman Empire—an empire that fundamentally influenced the trajectory of Western culture, religion, governance, and philosophy.Ponder a history of Rome that has not been retouched by myriadic emperors, by Constantine&#x27;s Christianity, or the interpretive lens of the Roman Catholic Church. Unmediated accounts of Roman society, unaltered by the layers of religious and political power that came later, could rewrite our textbooks and shift the justification of history. It’s not just about enriching our understanding of ancient civilizations; this could be a cornerstone on which to build a fresh philosophical understanding of human society.If the project succeeds, there will be repercussions in the academic realm. The humanities have long struggled to justify their existence in a world that increasingly prizes STEM and lacks any novel sources for the classical world. Suddenly, there could be a concrete, urgent task at hand: to decode, interpret, and integrate an influx of new knowledge. The Vesuvius Challenge could revitalize the field, offering an unforeseen but compelling reason for its study. In essence, it provides a utilitarian justification for the humanities, one that transcends &#x27;cultural enrichment&#x27; and enters the realm of &#x27;historical redefinition.&#x27;The Vesuvius Challenge could be the hinge upon which history swings, yielding intellectual treasure that could be as groundbreaking as the writings that were lost in Alexandria. For millennia, those scrolls have remained unread. Now, it&#x27;s a software problem. That&#x27;s not just a challenge; it’s an imperative.The presence of specific works in the Herculaneum Papyri could dramatically impact our understanding of major historical events.In particular for me, I pray that the biography of Herod the Great by Nicholas of Damascus is discovered intact. While mainstream accounts generally portray the life of Herod within the context of Roman patronage and Judaean politics, uncovering a contemporary account by a close intimate (and used as a primary source by Josephus) would offer fresh, unmediated insights into his rule and its socio-political intricacies. Chronologies of the life of Jesus could be explicitly validated or disproved.The relevance here is far from academic. Consider the following naturalistic hypothesis: that the inception and rise of Christianity was entirely a dynastic struggle within the Hasmonean-Herodian line. What if the tale of Jesus is, in essence, a dramatized, mystified rendition of a 1st-century dynastic conflict, one that was subsequently co-opted and transformed into a religious narrative by an early form of conspiratorial thinking? Something like a 1st-century version of Q-anon, distorting real events to serve an alternative, concealed agenda in the aftermath of the First Jewish-Roman War.Unveiling a document like Nicholas of Damascus&#x27; biography could be groundbreaking in testing such a hypothesis. If Herod&#x27;s life and rule were detailed without the religious overlays that later Christian interpretations bring into the picture, one could make more definitive assertions about the socio-political environment of the time. Furthermore, it could provide concrete evidence to either substantiate or refute theories about Christianity&#x27;s emergence as a byproduct of a Herodian-Hasmonean power struggle.The fact that such a theory could be tested is significant in its own right. Traditionally, discussions about early Christianity rely heavily on religious texts and subsequent historical accounts, many of which are fraught with dogma and ideological interpretations. A primary source devoid of such influences would be a game-changer, offering a baseline of raw data from which more accurate and reliable hypotheses could be drawn.And it&#x27;s not limited solely to Christianity. Rabbinic Judaism could have equally monumental implications as a result. The owner of the villa, likely a wealthy Roman, would be unlikely to have had any primary Hebrew texts like the Pentateuch. However, that doesn&#x27;t rule out the possibility of possessing Greek or Latin works discussing Jewish culture, beliefs, and politics. Given the villa&#x27;s historical context, it&#x27;s conceivable that there might be indirect ethnographic accounts from the period surrounding the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD but before the Council of Jamnia, traditionally dated around 90 AD, which helped canonize Hebrew scriptures.Why is this important? The Council of Jamnia is often cited as a crucial moment for the development of Rabbinic Judaism. It allegedly led to the fixing of the Hebrew Bible canon and crystallized what would become Talmudic tradition. If documents were to surface that provide a snapshot of Judaic thought and practice just before this council, it could upend millennia of precedent and identity.In a broader context, discovering pre-Jamnia ethnographic sources could significantly change our understanding of how Judaism adapted and evolved in the aftermath of the Second Temple&#x27;s destruction. This could lead to far-reaching questions. How much of the Talmudic tradition was actually a post-hoc rationalization or systematization of beliefs and practices that were far more fluid before the Council of Jamnia? How much anti-Romanism was pared away to prevent suppression? Moreover, how would such a revelation interact with or even challenge the validity of current Rabbinic and Orthodox Jewish practices?The implications for the Judeo-Christian heritage as a whole are staggering. If both Christianity and Judaism could be traced back explicitly to politically or socially motivated machinations, rather than divinely inspired or time-honored traditions, the entire foundation of Judeo-Christian culture would come into question. In essence, the Vesuvius Challenge has the potential to destabilize two of the world’s major religious traditions at their historical roots. It is difficult to overstate the potential impacts.The Vesuvius Challenge is not just an academic or technological endeavor. Its success could instigate an unparalleled epistemological crisis in religious studies and the humanities. It provides the opportunity to re-examine, with primary sources, the historical foundations of Western religious, cultural, and ultimately political traditions. We&#x27;re not just potentially rewriting history here; we&#x27;re reevaluating the very frameworks through which that history has been understood. reply oceanplexian 12 hours agoparentI mean, I admire your optimism that historical texts will somehow shake the foundations of religious institutions.

Some histories of Palestine or Christians causing trouble in Rome seem possible, or notes on a Herod&#x27;s time in power that don&#x27;t match the Christian narrative. but none of this seems too threatening, large swathes of Christian thought now treats the birth narrative as ahistorical. It might be another blow for the bible literalists, but they&#x27;re a small group overall and those battles have been going on since the 2nd century. Another Josephus or Tacitus would be great. The big opportunity here is to dismiss the Jesus myth-ers by finding more evidence that a person called Jesus existed.

Sure, there&#x27;ll be dinosaurs-are-just-a-test-of-faith types, but the explanation of Christianity as a naturalistic emergence with the \"mysteries\" of the religion given banal and explicit answers would likely make the revolutions in Biblical criticism in the 19th century (e.g. linguistic analysis revealing multiple authors with narrow dates) look like child&#x27;s play in comparison.At any time in the last sixteen hundred years, if such evidence were uncovered, it would&#x27;ve been burned immediately and the monastic reading it likely consigned to perpetual silence, lest the word get out.But the hegemony of Christianity in the West is over. reply telotortium 11 hours agorootparentWhat makes you think \"myth of Jesus the Christ turns out to be, say, a cipher of the re-execution of Alexandros I, the son of Herod the Great and Mariamne I\" is at all likely? I read a theory once that Jesus Christ was a reinterpretation of Julius Caesar that was adopted by Romans after the former imperial cult fell out of favor. That seems farfetched, but more likely than this - at least it provides a better explanation of why Romans cared about Christianity.I&#x27;d love to have texts that spoke more about the origins of Christianity and Judaism, but it&#x27;s far more likely that this trove will contain nothing of the sort - you could imagine a Roman aristocrat in Italy caring about this, but it doesn&#x27;t seem especially likely. reply nataliste 9 hours agorootparent>What makes you think \"myth of Jesus the Christ turns out to be, say, a cipher of the re-execution of Alexandros I, the son of Herod the Great and Mariamne I\" is at all likely?It&#x27;s not just Nicholas of Damascus that would reveal such information. Gaius Asinius Pollio, a multifaceted Roman figure known for his connections with literary giants like Virgil and Horace as well as Augustus himself, mentored Alexander, the son of Herod the Great. The Roman world in the first century was wide.Anyway, as to why I think it&#x27;s possible, I think it&#x27;s the most simple explanation as to how it emerged. According to what we have (i.e. Josephus) Alexander had the support of the public but was disliked by Herod&#x27;s loyalists due to his opposing qualities and lineage from the Hasmonean dynasty.Herod the Great, notorious for his brutal tactics, killed off male members of the Hasmonean dynasty and married the last Hasmonean princess to solidify his rule. He exhibited suspicion towards his wife Mariamne who was also killed eventually, along with their son Alexander.I posit that Alexander was not actually executed, being a popular favorite and the son of the tyrant who might regret his decision and punish accordingly. Instead, he laid low until Herod&#x27;s death, aiming to rightfully claim the throne, but was instead executed to maintain Roman rule over Judea with the consent of the Sanhedrin.After the First Roman-Jewish War, continued supporters of Alexander coded secret histories into what became the apocryphal and synoptic gospels. Episodes like the massacre of the innocents coming from the Hasmonean male purge, \"Jesus\" being found in His Father&#x27;s temple coming from Alexander visiting the building site of the Second Temple erected by his father, Herod. There are plenty of other episodes that seem to neatly correspond to and dispel underlying \"mysteries\" in the synoptic gospels for anyone actually looking for them.The survival of works by Asinius Pollio or Nicholas of Damascus in particular in the Herculaneum library could confirm or refute this theory. Their writings, likely popular in aristocratic households due to Nicholas and Gaius Asinius Pollio&#x27;s favor with the Julians, would very much be pertinent to a Roman aristocrat in 79AD.But I don&#x27;t need to prove it via circumstantial and inferential evidence--that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m excited. We could actually uncover period documentation by the actual participants rather than the heresay of the following generations living under the shadow of Roman retribution. reply Amezarak 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure why you think an explanation involving a vast empire-spanning conspiracy supported with widespread propaganda and centuries of silence and suppression even from its enemies is more likely than the usual naturalistic explanation \"Jesus was a real figure who did the non-supernatural things ascribed to him.\"People love these conspiracy theories about religions but they&#x27;re definitely not the simple or logical explanations. reply nataliste 9 hours agorootparentWhat are you even on about?I&#x27;m talking about widespread suppression of Jews, whether Christianized or not, that is documented before and in the aftermath of the first Jewish-Roman war, which occurred 68-74AD.There&#x27;s no empire-spanning conspiracy lasting centuries, but a continual massage of what came before to justify the current status quo, an extremely similar dynamic as what is recognized by biblical scholars when treating the Old Testament. reply Amezarak 8 hours agorootparentChristianized Jews and Jews generally were spread throughout and beyond the empire. The persecutions, even postwar, were terrible but relatively localized and there is no reason to believe it involved the mass redaction of all existing documents (not even possible!) and then-unwritten oral histories (which then everyone, antisemites, Christians, pagans, all alike decided to maintain silence about even though they would have been delighted to show their enemies up with this evidence) except that it makes people feel clever to think so.Even more incredibly, plenty of heretical documents did survive! People were one hundred percent successful absolutely crushing any leaks of a vast conspiracy to “justify the status quo” (why do you even think it needed justifying?) even against powerful groups that would not have wanted to…but couldn’t stop eg the Gnostics.Most scholars don’t think that about the Old Testament either, although I have been learning lately it is very much in vogue on certain corners of the Internet. But at least that is in some respects at certain times more plausible depending on the specific text and time period being talked about, if very early. The Christianity conspiracy theories really aren’t. There’s no evidence for them whatever and yours in particular boggles belief, and is really not remotely feasible.

The study also did not break the demographics down by religion, nor does it represent hegemony. They don&#x27;t control the government or the educational institutions. Even further, the notion that religiosity in the West will be Christian is unproven.Regardless, the kind of active suppression of contradictory evidence to religious narratives that was historically present from the early middle ages to the early modern period is no longer extant. The Church can put any discovered texts on a Novus Index Librorum Prohibitorum all they want, but that&#x27;s not going to stop academia or the Internet from mining it.Also, I can speak from personal experience with a traditionalist Catholic father, none of his many kids are Catholic.

    "originBody": "artemis.sh - bandcamp - projects - blog - contact - rss - art - places - archive this site Scrollbars are becoming a problem 2023-10-12 Scrollbars. Ever heard of them? They’re pretty cool. Click and drag on a scrollbar and you can move content around in a scrollable content pane. I love that shit. Every day I am scrolling on my computer, all day long. But the scrollbars are getting smaller and this is increasingly becoming a problem. I would show you screenshots but they’re so small that even screenshotting them is hard to do. And people keep making them even smaller, hiding them away, its like they don’t want you to scroll! “Ah”, they say, “that’s what the scroll wheel is for”. My friend, not everyone can use a scroll wheel or a swipe up touch screen. And me, a happy scroll-wheeler, even I would like to quickly jump around some time. Why it matters Ok so a lot of folks have fine motor control problems. Others use somewhat inaccurate pointing devices like eye-trackers (they’re very impressive, but not good enough for your 8 pixel wide scrollbar!!). And these people, they wanna scroll! When my friend is voice/sound controlling their computer (with Talon Voice which is really good btw you should try it), they don’t wanna say “scroll down” over and over again or start auto scrolling and try to land in the right spot. They wanna just look at the scrollbar and click on the spot they wanna be looking at. You click on the spot and the content goes there! It’s THE GOOD STUFF!!! I am not the first to notice this. See this post too in 2015 discussing this problem. I’d hate to go back in time only to tell them nothing has improved. “The simple fact that these skinny scroll bars exist are evidence that designers do not sit with non technical users to conduct usability testing. Because if they did that they would immediately discover the problem. People with dexterity and hand control challenges have a difficult time with these skinny scroll bars. People with eye sight challenges suffer with these skinny scroll bars.” The Problems People keep making the bar smaller! Or trying to get rid of it! I’m naming names of software I use day to day, but it’s not just them, people are doing this even outside the world of Linux. In some of the cases the problem is actually that the bar is precisely the same size it always has been (in pixels), but monitor resolutions are much higher than when that bar width was first chosen, and bars haven’t started scaling to keep up, but in other cases the bars are actually getting smaller. Gods, remember the needle-bar Ubuntu tried to introduce for a bit? lmao. And while the bars were shrinking, another feature silently disappeared: buttons to click and hold down to scroll left/right in increments. Arrow-keys largely hold this functionality now, but are dependent on what content is in focus. Buttons were not dependent on this. Actually, some of you might not even know what I’m talking about. These: I don’t use these! But I added it into this post on request of someone who does, and wants them back. By and large the trend that persists is, the bars get less usable, and either there are no user-configurable ways to fix them, or the ability to configure the options are buried so deep into the tech stack that no normal user can find them. I’m extremely technical. Many of my friends are not, and it’s their troubles that have driven me to write this post. GTK In GTK2, you could modify scrollbar widths directly in your gtkrc, and GUI programs existed to do this. In GTK3, this is CSS. Which, OK I guess, but there hasn’t really been a good user-friendly way to set it unless you understand theming. I found this reddit thread with a good script for it, which I’ll reproduce here in the likely event that reddit dies. Put this in a .sh file and run it if you need. #!/bin/bash echo \"NEW SCROLLBAR WIDTH(px) OR TYPE 'r' TO RESET\" while true; do read uin uin=$(echo \"$uin\"xargs) # trim uin=$(echo \"${uin,,}\") # lower case if [[ \"$uin\" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ || \"$uin\" == \"r\" ]]; then # RESET # remove previous width in gtk.css (if any) if [ -f \"$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\" ]; then if [[ $(grep -v \"slider { min-width\" \"$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\") ]]; then grep -v \"slider { min-width\" \"$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\" > tmpfile && mv tmpfile \"$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\" else rm \"$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\" fi fi if [ -f \"$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css\" ]; then if [[ $(grep -v \"slider { min-width\" \"$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css\") ]]; then grep -v \"slider { min-width\" \"$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css\" > tmpfile && mv tmpfile \"$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css\" else rm \"$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css\" fi fi # reset scrollbar visibility gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling # reset flatpak overrides if [[ \"$(flatpak --version 2>&1)\" =~ ^Flatpak ]] && [ -f \"$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global\" ]; then sed -i 's|xdg-config/gtk-3.0;||g' \"$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global\" sed -i 's|xdg-config/gtk-4.0;||g' \"$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global\" # if the those were the only filesystem overrides, remove the filesystems= line grep -vx \"filesystems=\" \"$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global\" > tmpfile && mv tmpfile \"$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global\" # if there are no other overrides, remove the flatpak global overrides file if [[ ! $(grep -vx \"\\[Context\\]\" \"$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global\") ]]; then rm \"$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global\" fi fi # APPLY NEW SETTINGS if [[ \"$uin\" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ ]]; then # add new width in gtk.css echo \"slider { min-width: ${uin}px; min-height: ${uin}px; }\" >> \"$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\" echo \"slider { min-width: ${uin}px; min-height: ${uin}px; }\" >> \"$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css\" # apply to flatpak (if installed) if [[ \"$(flatpak --version 2>&1)\" =~ ^Flatpak ]]; then flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0 --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0 fi # make scrollbar always visible gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false fi echo \"LOGOUT FOR EVERYTHING TO BE APPLIED\" read hold exit 0 else echo \"Invalid input, try again.\" fi done Naturally the script has to override flatpak separately because heaven forbid my flatpak applications look the way I themed my system. They’ve also started hiding the scrollbar entirely by default until you hover over where it’s supposed to be, what is that???? You can get it back in GTK 3 if you know the right command line command to type in. (the script above does this too btw) gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false Or you can find it in the GUI if you know how to navigate the Dconf Editor, I guess. lol. Though in GTK 4, you can’t even set this setting globally. See this thread right here, which to the best of my knowledge is still true as of writing. > > Who ever said they were going to \"go\"?

Qt To quote /u/cfeck_kde on /r/kde: “The width of Qt scrollbars is determined by the Qt widget style plugin you are using. As far as I know, only the Skulpture style allows configurable sizes. For other styles like Breeze, you would need to change the C++ source and recompile.” On the one paw, recompile my GUI theme? - but hey I’m a gentoo user I do that every friday anyway, I could just drop a patch in I guess… RECOMPILE MY GUI THEME?? I repeat, But on the other paw, because Qt style plugins are real code they do get to have a lot more power here if you find one that lets you change what you want. I use Kvantum personally. I can’t seem to find a setting in its configuration to change scrollbar width, but I can disable scrollbar disappearing (which it calls “Transient scrollbars”) so that’s nice. Anyways, I tried out Skulpture like the reddit person recommended and it seems kinda cool, give it a try! I can’t figure out a way to configure it with a GUI though without using KDE Plasma though. No shade on Plasma, I just don’t have it installed right now to try it out, but maybe if you’re a plasma user it’ll be good for you. Still, if our only hope is this one theme engine that may or may not keep working as Qt development continues, I can’t help but feel like the war is being lost. Firefox Firefox has also joined the war on scrollbars it seems, with an incredibly tiny scrollbar on the side of my screen. Thankfully, Firefox is at least fixable (for now…), but you have to go into about:config to do it which is never a great sign. HOWEVER, you CAN do it. Type in about:config in your address bar Search for widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.size.override Edit it to whatever number you want You can also edit widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style to change the shape of it, set it to 4 for a nice chonk rectangle Finally, turn on “Always show scrollbars” in the normal settings window about:settings if you want them always on. Here, I set the size to 50. I don’t want it this big myself but by goly am I glad I can make it this big anyway. Behold, scrollbar glory: Chrome Imagine being able to configure anything useful in chrome ever. Electron For that matter, imagine configuring an Electron app. Couldn’t be me. Or anyone else, for that matter. Maybe you can inject some custom CSS into the electron app to fix things up? Honestly if you have solutions for Chrome or Electron please tell me because I have no idea. THERE ARE MORE Look these are just the ones I encounter regularly, but all of these so-called “modern design principles” seem to be in a war against scrollbars and everyone that uses computers slightly different from the people implementing this are suffering as a consequence. Shit sucks yo! The Best OK you know what rules though? You know what I love, what my friend who uses eye trackers loves, what my friends who use tablet pens love? MINIMAPS YEAH!!!!!!!!! I can see the content. I can click the content. I can go to the content. And the hit target is massive. What more could a girl want?",

And screens been getting more and more powerful.Often using software without white mode the thing is so bright, that the walls near me get lighted up as if I was using a flashlight or something.Thus I have to make the screen less bright, but often this also make the screen colors and contrast get all screwy and I still can&#x27;t see anything.I miss Win 9x era grey interface... it wasn&#x27;t beautiful but I could actually see stuff. reply Groxx 8 hours agorootparent... Ya know, I haven&#x27;t thought about that before, but screens are a lot brighter now aren&#x27;t they.

I use my screen with 0% brightness during the day and I have to reduce contrast during the night (which leads to reduced colour depth).

It&#x27;s no wonder people were clamoring for dark mode after blinding flat UI had taken over. reply hypercube33 8 hours agorootparentNot only that but it seems like color from icons has gone - now we get black and white ones.

We have these amazing screens with barely visible pixels and excellent color reproduction being wasted on rendering monochrome lines. reply masklinn 4 hours agorootparentMonochrome lines are cool tho, ink or charcoal can be gorgeous, and “barely visible pixels” are genuinely needed to get them.That aside, high dpi displays are still a rare sight on desktops, there’s not many of them and the aspect ratios and ancillary features are extremely limited. reply shiroiuma 1 hour agorootparent>That aside, high dpi displays are still a rare sight on desktopsNo, they aren&#x27;t.

I really don&#x27;t care if different programs look slightly different as long as its internally consistent in app.What I hate is installing a program that was designed for a KDE distro and because you run gnome all the icons are the same color as the background and alignments on things are whack.Package it all up in a flatpak so it looks and works exactly the same on all distros. One complete and verified experience. reply Pannoniae 6 hours agorootparent\"One complete and verified experience.\" These words sound sickening to me. None of these have anything to do with accessibility, or respecting the user.The user should be in control of his computer. That includes the programs on it. Locking it down so you can have \"verified authentic design\" is just straight-up user-hostile. reply Gigachad 5 hours agorootparentThis is the main reason I switched to MacOS. Was sick of everything on Linux being contentiously broken out of the box with the excuse \"Oh you are meant to just configure the icon colours and toolbar padding yourself\"The programs can still be open source so you can recompile with whatever look you want, but they should bundle a working experiance by default.But linux users seem more obsessed with curating custom themes over having things actually work. reply Pannoniae 4 hours agorootparentI shouldn&#x27;t have to recompile something to customise it. Make the defaults whatever you want sure, but even if you don&#x27;t provide GUI config, provide an environment variable or a config file. \"just recompile it\" is incredibly user-hostile. reply pseudalopex 6 hours agorootparentprevThose words reminded me of Apple&#x27;s 1984 commercial. reply treyd 6 hours agorootparentprevI disagree. The user has accessibility needs and preferences that the app developers necessarily can&#x27;t know about. App developers shouldn&#x27;t be trying to enforce styles&#x2F;themes&#x2F;icons on the user when they might be completely unusable depending on their needs. The inconsistencies between KDE and GNOME apps&#x2F;themes are annoying, but that&#x27;s a solvable problem. reply SkiFire13 4 hours agorootparentprev\"don&#x27;t theme my app\" is not about users theming their apps, but instead against distros theming by default and more importantly the expectation that you could theme every app with a generic theme. reply gonzo41 7 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s also the consideration that a decent style sheet can be ~100 - 200 lines long. Yet I see ~5000 line css files that have so much custom formatting for JS frameworks that build everything with divs, rather than using semantic HTML5 which has accessibility baked in. reply MereInterest 7 hours agorootparentIt seems like there&#x27;s two wildly different ways that CSS gets used. In one style, a CSS class is a semantic category of things on the page, and the style sheet defines how it looks. In the other, a CSS class has no semantic meaning, and the style sheet defines a list of options to choose from. It&#x27;s the difference between `` and ``.The first type of CSS can be written succinctly, but the second cannot. reply o11c 7 hours agoparentprev\"Dark mode\" is needed in dark rooms, since screens don&#x27;t autoadjust their backlight based on the room&#x27;s white point.The concept of \"white point\" is often spoken of in terms of color, but brightness very much does matter too. It is painful for there to be something (especially something large) brighter than \"white\".**That said, we should have automatic dark mode based in inverting HSL&#x27;s \"lightness\" (this can trivially be done directly in RGB, just check the min and max color channel of the pixel, then adjust all channels to flip them), rather than requiring ad-hoc color schemes all over the place. reply callalex 7 hours agorootparentThis is one thing Apple got right a veeeery long time ago. Every screen they have sold since like the mid 2000s, both integrated and standalone, has had auto brightness. I don’t understand why other manufacturers still can’t that right, to this day, no matter the price category. Even most non-Apple smartphones these days still suck at this. reply bee_rider 7 hours agorootparentI’m surprised Linux doesn’t have some ubiquitous “use the camera to do auto-brightness” option (pinging the camera on a proprietary OS would be creepy, but if it is open source…). reply callalex 7 hours agorootparentThat wouldn’t work very well because pretty much every webcam has auto exposure adjustment. Also a camera is good at determining how much light is in the room behind you, not how much light is hitting the screen. There really is no substitute for a photodiode and a halfway decent control algorithm. It only costs a penny so there really is no excuse not to include one. reply alpaca128 2 hours agoparentprev> we wouldn&#x27;t need \"dark mode\" or the such if the UIs had any contrast and were legibleHave you tried dark mode in Windows 11?

Aside from not being able to differentiate one window from another similarly colored window in the background, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to click and hold on anything along the edge to resize the window.It&#x27;s the overloading of the title bar with so much shit like search boxes and extraneous buttons that a user has almost no place to grip to move the window.It&#x27;s the way that tabbing between text boxes either doesn&#x27;t behave the way you&#x27;d expect, or doesn&#x27;t work at all.It&#x27;s all the tooltips that interrupt and litter the interface and, at times, block out things that you are looking at.

They are about as bad as desktop software gets.The biggest sin is that this would be a non-issue if these things were configurable at the windowing system level and could not be overriden by app developers.

Classic MacOS got a lot of things right that are missing in current operating systems, but man is it ugly. reply jchw 7 hours agorootparentprevI absolutely agree. For at least 10 years now, my dream has been to essentially recreate the Windows 2000&#x2F;XP UX as a Linux desktop environment.That said, doing so would basically require creating everything from the ground up, because merely theming some existing toolkit and window manager to look like XP is not at all the point. And frankly, there HAVE been SOME useful UI&#x2F;UX improvements in the past couple decades, like, FTA, minimaps. But can you imagine a much more conservative desktop, with highly integrated apps, based on the \"good old days\" of desktop design with just a touch of modern elements when they improve on things?... Truth told, the closest thing in existence is probably SerenityOS... but it really would be more practical if there was a Linux desktop for this. Every so often I fantasize about how I might start such a project. It&#x27;s been like that forever now. reply jwrallie 6 hours agorootparentI believe the biggest obstacle is dealing with different toolkits, since gtk3 and later are constantly breaking theme compatibility with new versions, and nobody have the time to maintain good alternative themes in these conditions.XFCE with Chicago95 already exists (and so does Q4OS with XPQ4) as proof of concept that the window manager and toolbar side can be replicated.The problem is that important pieces of software are not relying on any toolkit directly, but implementing their own version, so even if you support qt, gtk2 and gtk3+ applications with 3 different themes, there will be software running under electron or implementing their own client side decorations and breaking all the rules.I think the easiest way to start would be to simply collect and maintain existing themes with a unified look and make a distro based on Ubuntu LTS or even RHEL to avoid breaking changes at maximum. This distro would have pre-selected software that behaves well with the selected themes, and need to have at absolute minimum a working browser with extensions following that theme.If implementing from the bottom up, then something similar to helloSystem could also be a way, but I do not see it working in practice due to the time it would take. reply gnyman 5 hours agorootparentprevHave you looked at Q4OS with the windows theme pack? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;q4os.org&#x2F; and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xpq4.sourceforge.io&#x2F;It&#x27;s does not seem well known but it looks and works very closely to old Windows.I have a side project plan to take this, combine it with a decent laptop, pre install libreoffice and a browser and sell it as \"Stable OS\" with a long term \"no-change\" policy to anyone who just needs a basic computer where not everything changes at the whim of someone looking for a item on their resume. reply cwillu 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you haven&#x27;t already, look at xfce. reply jchw 6 hours agorootparentI did like XFCE at one point, but it never really did quite nail the UX for me. A lot of the problem is more on GTK+2 than it was anything else. (Obligatory mention of no thumbnails in file dialog; I used to patch GTK by hand for this!) Now with newer versions of GTK, this problem has unfortunately gotten worse for me, and I don&#x27;t really prefer XFCE very much. Worseyet, I&#x27;ve gotten used to wlroots giving me good support for things that never really worked well in X11, and XFCE&#x27;s plan regarding X11 and Wayland going into the future is still somewhat unclear.I also tried LXDE and LXQt as well. I actually thought LXQt might be the one for me, but it was a bit buggy and lacked a lot of much-needed maintenance.Also, although I&#x27;m glad Linux developers don&#x27;t always make a habit of just simply throwing out ideas and code that works fine, it does bother me how antiquated some things have gotten. DBus is the best desktop IPC option on Linux, and that&#x27;s not really a great thing in my opinion. Likewise, it sucks that most file archivers still work by popening some command and parsing its output, occasionally breaking on edge cases, usually having limited support for the kinds of advanced functionality you&#x27;d get in Windows archive tools. I do understand that making actually-good applications takes time, but over the course of the past couple decades it doesn&#x27;t feel like much progress has been made here. I mean hell, speaking of archive tools... FreeBSD has been working on libarchive for ages and it&#x27;ll likely be integrated with fucking Windows before it&#x27;s integrated with common Linux desktops, which will probably mostly farm out to CLI tools like unar and zip directly. This is the same approach, with the same exact problems, that I remember being used as far back as when I started using Linux, in programs like Xfe.Needless to say... my feelings are complicated. reply marcus_holmes 6 hours agorootparentprevusing KDE Plasma, which isn&#x27;t bad, and is configurable enough :) reply TerrifiedMouse 6 hours agorootparentprevWin95 default was peak Windows UI for me.

It&#x27;s the quasi \"natural\" origin and anchor of any basic interactions with the viewport.

Add multiple workspaces just as they are today and it is perfect.Unfortunately Windows and MacOS don&#x27;t really support this kind of environment very well. Sure you can tile windows, but they are still windows. When you open an application it is not immediately tiled or opened in another workspace etc. reply bayindirh 40 minutes agorootparentEverybody says \"floating windows are dead\", but I fail to get sold on the tiling concept. For people working on 3 windows, that may be acceptable, but if one&#x27;s juggling 10 windows on a couple of desktops, things get hairy fast.Window resizing also helps a lot of things in terminal. Sometimes programs write log lines so long, I have to resize the terminal wider than the screen itself to make sure that every log is written in single line to be able debug things with some efficiency.Also, not everyone uses GNOME. KDE has very nice features for floating windows like \"dim inactive\" which makes working with many windows a breeze, while effectively cutting eye strain, because your average screen brightness is lower, without turning down your lighting. Also, enabling window shadowing convincingly raises active windows over others, so brain&#x27;s depth perception can isolate said window pretty easily.Both ways (floating and tiling) have advantages over each other in some use cases. I use an hybrid approach (manual tiling of floating windows with snapping), but the scenarios I prefer tiling is really rare, I may say. reply DanielHB 11 minutes agorootparentI am thinking that most of the time you want your applications full screen with tiling been an advanced user kind of thingI myself mostly use MacOS without tilling, I just keep all my applications full screen and use multiple workspaces.

When I had outlook in the office, it would summarize how much time I spent in meetings, seemingly to increase my stress level one more notch.The lack of a scroll bar returns mystery, but even more, it brings us back to a simpler time when we weren&#x27;t overloaded by information such as \"how much is left of this text?\" or \"is there a button hidden somewhere on this page that allows me to complete my task, or is the app just broken?\"These are the sorts of small joys that we miss in the Information Age. reply blix 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s so you can doomscroll for hours without realizing how much content you have consumed.

Did they test how much of a hassle can be to grab a two pixel wide area on a 13\" screen laptop? I can understand they need real estate to be used for actual content, but seriously how hard would be to have a small \"handle\" that protrudes out of the closest window corner&#x2F;border when the pointer is like less than 10 pixel away from that, and disappears after say 1 second that it moved away? reply nine_k 8 hours agoprevThe author sees half the problem and offers the worse half of a solution.A scrollbar is not only a control, it&#x27;s also an indicator. It shows where your viewport is relative to the bigger view, e.g. a long list. Hiding scrollbars, like some [redacted] GUIs like macOS do, is just acutely impolite, much like making buttons indistinguishable from text, or putting light grey text on a light grey background.A solution exists, and is nearly universally implemented: scroll wheels on a mouse, and scroll gestures on a trackpad. Very, very rarely do I find a view which can be scrolled by scrollbars, but cannot be scrolled by the standard trackpad gesture, or by a mouse wheel. (BTW my mouse also allows horizontal scrolling using the wheel; so do trackpoint controls, too.)Such scrolling does not require the pointer to even be at a scrollbar; the pointer just need to hover over the desired view &#x2F; control &#x2F; widget. This is really easy to achieve with imprecise input devices, unsteady hands, and poor vision.But with this natural, easy way of scrolling one starts to really miss scrollbars in their indicator role.(Regarding minimaps: sometimes they are helpful, sometimes not so much. I in particular find them unhelpful and bulky for text editing, but of course I&#x27;m all in favor of having them as an option for those who enjoy them.) reply pitterpatter 8 hours agoparent>A solution exists, and is nearly universally implemented: scroll wheels on a mouse, and scroll gestures on a trackpad.So you didn&#x27;t read the article huh. The very first paragraph says:>“Ah”, they say, “that’s what the scroll wheel is for”. My friend, not everyone can use a scroll wheel or a swipe up touch screen.Or literally the next paragraph about difficulties small&#x2F;hidden scrollbars cause with other input methods, e.g. eye trackers. reply wilg 8 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s stopping those input methods from having a special scroll gesture that is optimal for their input medium? But sure, have an accessibility override for giant scrollbars. reply nine_k 8 hours agorootparentprevI thinks that of all things, eye trackers and voice controllers have the easiest time sending whatever scrolling commands, without a need to fiddle with scrollbars. reply whartung 7 hours agoparentprevScroll wheels and gestures are paging mechanisms, a scrollbar does that as well but it’s also a “take me to the middle of the document” control.Assuming a properly responsive document (not something you can take for granted today, especially on the web), you can readily use the scrollbar to navigate large ranges within a document, especially large ones.Countless times, on large, old PDFs with no links and that use that kind of “B-29” section page numbering have I essentially used the scrollbar to binary search the document for some buried page.Of course the modern web has practically destroyed the applicability of the scrollbar as indicator because of the rampant use of lazy loading and endless scrolling. Many times on the Mac I’ve tried to use Cmd-down arrow to jump to the end of the document, hoping that there IS an end, and that it will load all of embeds that wreak havoc with the formatting.But, alas, I find I’m on some endless train, with no hope of knowing how far I’ve gone or how far I have to go.All that said, I happen to have a weighted mouse wheel on a bearing that is specifically designed for high velocity doom scrolling, partly because the scrollbar is effectively useless. reply sime2009 3 hours agoparentprev> A scrollbar is not only a control, it&#x27;s also an indicator.Thank you! finally someone understands what a scrollbar is for. It primary job is to show the user that the document is bigger than the window, and secondly, to show which part of the document is visible.

There are raytracing&#x2F;raymarching techniques too, but these look different, and they are most likely cost prohibitive for arbitrary function. There is the marching tetrahedra algorithm too, but I doesn&#x27;t look like it and don&#x27;t see a reason to use it now that the patent for the marching cubes algorithm has expired. reply gfodor 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s @iquilezles&#x27;s work who is a ray marching wizard, in the most literal sense of the word that still comports with reality. reply Jasper_ 4 hours agorootparentSource?

I have tried Desmos twice but couldn&#x27;t immediately spot the differences. What are the benefits of Desmos over GeoGebra? reply lights0123 17 hours agorootparentDesmos has a far smoother UI. Geogebra will often convert equations into its own format after clicking away from the equation editor, and if you mistyped or want to change the structure you must erase and re-type the whole thing—for example, typing f(x) will convert the equation into its own format where you can&#x27;t edit parameters or the function name. Desmos leaves your input as text, allowing you to change input at the character level. From my high school experience where both were used frequently, a lot of frustration was expressed with Geogebra where missing a parenthesis forced you to re-type the entire equation since it often assumed the bulk of your equation was a parameter, and there was no way to correct it. reply nsajko 14 hours agorootparent> frustration was expressed with Geogebra where missing a parenthesis forced you to re-type the entire equation since it often assumed the bulk of your equation was a parameter, and there was no way to correct it.I believe this may simply be a case of not knowing Geogebra well, or it&#x27;s simply caused by differences in taste&#x2F;being accustomed to a single user interface. In my experience, Geogebra offers the ability to edit the source of any object after selecting its settings.

And suddenly it’s obvious. Hauling your body across the room just to flip a switch is absurd. So you decide to get smart lights. Two hours later, your world is pain: Z-Wave Zigbee MQTT Matter Thread Echo Google Home Apple Home HomeKit Homebridge Home Assistant Hue deCONZ Sharp tools IFTTT Tuya Nest RBOY TRÅDFRI Hubitat SmartThings WiFi repeaters Mesh networks Powerline networks WiFi AX WiFi 2.4 GHz WiFi 5 GHz WiFi 6 high gain antennas Integrations ESPHome KNX The hell? But people seem to think that Home Assistant is good. (Something about subscription fees and invasive apps and forced obsolescence?) So you search for “how to get a Home Assistant”. This reveals a recursive landscape of terror: Home Assistant Operating System Home Assistant Container Home Assistant Supervised Home Assistant Core Home Assistant OS Home Assistant Yellow Home Assistant Green curl tarball sudo ssh NUC Rasberry Pi Blueprints NAS VirtualBox Docker Ubuntu Debian Python pip3 Virtual environments Proxmox Hypervisor LXC M.2 slots YAML SQLite Wireguard SkyConnect Z-WaveJS2MQTT In desperation you go to a smart home forum and make a post titled “smart lights no agony please help dear god”. The first response is: Just get a Qetzl hub, a OTOROXv3.2 bridge, and any MongoChopper compatible bulbs. After matroid paring, you can connect xmpf12 beacons and trigger them with plain-old SkyDust switches. Are you trying to make this complicated? Which sounds lovely. But then there’s many replies like this: MongoChopper only works in reticulated mode, which newer Qetzl hubs don’t support. Easier to just make a custom Hellfire demarkation loop. (Just. Always “just”.) Eventually you admit you’ve already suffered more than a lifetime of flipping switches and go to bed, mournful of your four lost hours of reading. You dream of a giant planetary light switch, glowing in brutal simplicity. So. Many people feel this way. Dumb homes are fine, but require flipping switches. Smart homes should be better, but in practice the cost of administering a new home IT nightmare outweighs the benefits. But perhaps there’s a third way. What if you try to achieve the goals of a smart home, but you rule out anything that involves getting two computers to talk to each other? So apps, phones, and hubs are out. But doorbells are good. Garage door openers are good. Dishwashers and smoke alarms are great. What else is there like that? Quite a lot, arguably. Things that exist I have neurotic “no club that would have me” relationship with product links: They’re convenient, but it’s hard to be sure of the motivations of anyone who provides them. So no links here, affiliate or otherwise. They wouldn’t be very useful anyway since most of this stuff is sold by brands like ELFPUFF that disappear after two weeks. Remote-controlled outlets. These are probably the easiest win for most people. Plug stuff into the cubes, plug the cubes into the wall, and use the remote to control which cubes are active. The buttons work instantly, with a range of 30 m (100 ft) even through walls. There is no app or WiFi. One button can control multiple plugs and the same plug can be paired to multiple remotes. (Cost: Around $25 for five plugs and two remotes.) The obvious use for these is lights. When your roommate complains about you strobing them (it’s irresistible) remind them that LED bulbs’ lifespans are not shortened by on/off cycles. They’re also great for fans, air purifiers, and humidifiers. Or, you can use this as a remote for a dumb window-unit air conditioner. (Make sure to check the rated current.) Or, you can use this as a signal—put a light in the basement for grandma to activate if she needs you. Or put lights in rooms around the house all paired to one button, and strobe them when you want everyone to gather for dinner. Or, you can use this for tea. My usual process for making tea is to walk to the kitchen and start the kettle. Then, because it takes an eternity for water to boil, I go back to my desk to wait. Then I forget about the tea. With this remote you can leave the kettle in a “ready” state: filled with water, kettle on, outlet off. Activate the remote a few minutes ahead of time and make tea in a single trip with no waiting. Or, my printer is cursed. After being on for a few days it refuses to print anything longer than two pages. I know this shouldn’t be possible, but I’ve exhausted every avenue for fixing it. I could get a new printer, but maybe it’s a network issue or something? Restarting the printer fixes it. But the printer has one of those infuriating power buttons where you hold it for ten seconds and then it ignores you. So for a year, I’d walk to the room with the printer and reach deep inside the cabinet to physically unplug and re-plug it. Now I use one of these cubes and remotely power cycle it when necessary. Utterly graceless, but effective. Remote-controlled light sockets. These are the same as the above, except they work on light sockets rather than outlets. Less versatile, but work with built-in light fixtures. ($30 for 5 sockets and 2 remotes) Remote-controlled light bulbs. Personally, I’d never buy these, because I’m fanatical about color quality. (It’s futile to start with low-quality photons and then try to arrange matter to make them look good.) And if you have multiple bulbs and one remote, what do you do when one bulb breaks? But they do exist. The remote talks directly to the light bulbs with no WiFi. And if you want dimming or changing colors, this seems to be the only midwit option. ($20 for 4 bulbs and 2 remotes) Motion sensing light bulbs. These have a small sensor at the tip. Put them into any light figure and then leave it on. After sensing motion, the bulb actives for a while. Great for dark stairs. ($5-10 per bulb) Motion sensing bulb sockets. These turn any bulb into a motion-sensing bulb. In principle, it seems good to separate the motion sensing bits from the glowy bits. But in practice the front assembly blocks the sensor from seeing straight ahead, so it may not be the way to go. It also looks very, uhh, long. ($11) Motion sensing outlets. When these sense motion, they activate the plug for a configurable amount of time. ($20 per plug) One application is to sense motion in a different place from where you want light. But there are many other uses. Some people with kids put these on window unit air conditioners in rarely used rooms, so they aren’t constantly nagging them to turn things off. Or, despite cats’ contempt for human life, many people keep them as pets. When cats use litter boxes, they produce undesirable smells. You can connect an air purifier to one of these to automatically turn on and remove those smells. Remote motion sensing outlets. For even more flexibility, these use battery-operated motion sensors, which can be far away from the outlet. ($26) Not totally sure where these would be useful. Maybe if you have a bunch of roommates and one bathroom, you could put the sensor in the bathroom and a light in a public room, so people would know when the bathroom is free? Seems weird. Battery-powered motion sensing lights. These are small battery-powered lights that activate when they sense motion. Every time you open your closet and the light goes on, it feels like a little message from the universe that you matter. ($3-10 each.) The Clapper. When this outlet hears sounds at the right frequency separated by the right interval, it switches on or off. It was first sold in 1984 and as far as I can tell hasn’t been significantly updated since except to add a Bob Ross module. (Yes, this really exists. It gives quotes when you clap three times.) ($20) I’m confused. The Clapper seems to work fine. Why isn’t it more popular? I think it’s partly that it was originally marketed as an aid to the infirm and elderly rather than Retro Home Automation for Your Active Lifestyle. But why aren’t there new variants? The patent is long expired, but there seem to be few (and bad) competitors. There are even rumors that quality has declined for brand-name Clappers. Motorized shades/blinds with physical remotes. If you look at reviews for IKEA’s shades or blinds, there are many complaints about trying to pair them with a hub and phone. But you don’t need a hub! They come with a physical remote and there’s physical process to control how far they drop. Though sadly you lose the ability to set daily schedule or program them to move randomly and scare your dog. ($130-infinity) Mechanical outlet timers: You plug this into an outlet, it slowly spins once per day, and the pins determine is the outlet is active for each 30 minute period. ($5-10) This! This is the kind of thing I need more of in my life! I really think it deserves to be more celebrated as a triumph of design. But it’s existed for decades and I can’t find the original inventor. Many use these with light for plants. Or, it can be nice to wake up with light rather than sound. Instead of buying a light alarm clock, you can just plug a lamp into one of these. Or, if you buy into the rationalist trend of very bright lights, then you can rig up one of these up and have each day greet you with 100k lumens gently screaming into your face. Or, in winter, I use a (non-ultrasonic) humidifier. But it’s only really useful for a couple of hours before going to bed, after which humans provide plenty of humidity. Using a timer automates things, saves energy, and avoids humidity getting out of control in the middle of the night. Even better, it reduces how often you need to refill the tank. Digital outlet timers: A good alternative if you need more precise timing or find mechanical timers too beautiful and intuitive and bulletproof. ($15) Countdown outlet timer. Press a button and activate an outlet for a given period of time. Good for lights, air purifiers, heaters, and the paranoid. ($10-20) Door alarm / reminder. You mount a magnet on one side of a door and the detector on the other. You can configure it to either make noise immediately when opened or after a certain amount of time. Useful for doors or windows or refrigerator doors that are sometimes left open. ($4-20 per alarm, depending on how many you buy.) Key fobs for home doors. Unlock your home like you unlock a car. There’s even a battery-powered version that sticks on top of the inside lock and opens the door by physically turning the existing latch. And apparently this sort of works? This makes me nervous, though I know physical locks aren’t very secure anyway. ($50+) Watering stakes. The one true home decoration strategy is: plants. If you don’t have any plants, forget home intelligence levels and get some plants. Now, to keep them alive, you put one of these stakes in the soil and the end of the cable in a container of water. The soil then stays damp through voodoo magic. (It’s not a siphon because the water can be below the plant.) Purely physical, no electronics. In principle, this can work for a very long time if you have a big enough container of water. You can also make a crappy DIY version by drilling a tiny hole in the lid of a plastic bottle. ($5 / stake.) Water detector. This flashes and screams if water contacts the base. Batteries last for years. ($7-10 each) Robot vacuums with a physical remote. These still exist, for now! You can set a daily schedule without giving iRobot Amazon a map of your home. Temperature controlled outlets. Plug a device into it and plug it into the wall. The plug turns on and off when programmable temperatures are reached. ($20-30) Did the temperature sensor in your fridge break, meaning it stays on all the time? Does the manufacturer demand your first child for a new sensor? Plug the fridge into one of these. Rechargeable batteries. You already knew these existed. But did you know how much better they’ve gotten in recent years? I bring this up because where possible I advise avoiding things with built-in batteries. Partly that’s so the lifespan isn’t limited by the battery. But it’s also more convenient: To recharge, you swap the batteries with the ones on the charger and you’re done. This is much easier than going through a remove / find charger / charge / wait / replace cycle. Lessons One lesson is that lights do well. Half of smart homes seem to be about lights. By combining remotes, motion sensors, timers, and maybe Clappers, you can go quite far with lights just using midwit solutions. A second is that power is the interface. All of the above items are either single devices, or devices that “communicate” with each other by the brute force method of turning power on or off for each other. It’s interesting how far that takes you. Finally, dumber devices are often more interoperable. Physical on/off switches are good. If a device has one, then you can set it to “on” and then control it through an external remote or whatever. But increasingly many things have clever touch sensor power buttons. These can’t be activated without pressing the button, so none of this works. (BTW, manufacturers, if you want to use touch sensors and you don’t want to lose the massive midwit market, make things that automatically turn on when first connected to power, without waiting for a touch.) Things I wish existed There are many things that would make midwit life better, and it seems like could be made, but aren’t. Remote controlled dimmers. Modern dimmers work by truncating the lower-amplitude parts of the alternating current—basically switching the lights on and off very quickly. There should be light-bulb sockets with a remote to control the dimming level. Whistle controlled power switches. Clapping is (mildly) annoying. Couldn’t we use other sounds? PM2.5 controlled outlets. The biggest advantage of commercial air purifiers over DIY versions is that some integrate air quality sensors and turn on automatically when needed. I want a device that samples the air and activates an outlet if PM2.5 is above a threshold. Remote-controlled wall-switch pressers. This is rather cursed, but I’d like a device to physically flip my existing wall switches when activated by a remote, so my lights can be be dumb and midwit. (There are “smart” variants now, but seemingly no midwit versions.) Power-controlled remote pressers. This is utterly cursed, but hear me out: I want a gadget that I physically attach to a remote. When the gadget gets power, it presses the “on” button on the remote. When it loses power, it presses the “off” button. Why? Because then you could automate anything with a remote! If I have remote-controlled motorized blinds, I’d like to put the remote into this gadget, and then plug the gadget into an an outlet timer for a daily schedule. Or use a Clapper or motion sensor or whatever. Like I said, cursed. Maybe it could just memorize and repeat the signal from remote instead of physically pressing buttons? Remote-controlled light sockets that respond to power cycles. The annoying thing about remote-controlled light sockets is they render your existing switches useless. There is no need! I want a variant that works like this: If the power is quickly turned off and on again, the outlet switches from powered to unpowered (or vice-versa). Then you could use remotes and existing switches, with the only downside that you need to remember to “double flip” all your lights. Gates. Say you have Clapper-activated lights in your bedroom, but you do a lot of sleep-clapping. Well, you can plug the lights into a Clapper, and the Clapper into an outlet timer. That’s basically an AND gate. But what about OR gates? What if you want to turn on an air conditioner when there is motion or if the temperature goes above X degrees? I think an OR gate would just amount to a “splitter”, except with multiple inputs and one output. But this doesn’t seem to be something you can buy, perhaps because if the inputs came from different circuits that would cause explosions? Or how about NOT gates? Maybe you have an air purifier that’s really loud, so you only want it to run when you’re not in the room. There should be a gadget that reverses the power signal provided by a motion sensor. But then, how would a NOT gate work? The gadget would need to plug into the wall to provide power when the signal is off. Which means that really it would be a (NOT SIGNAL) AND (MAINS) gate. Or maybe could be an XOR gate instead? Or can we hand NAND gates? Or NOR gates? There’s no obvious need, true. But I’d rest easier knowing my janky kettle control system was built out of functionally complete base units.

See, her husband had recently passed away; he done \"all of the cool things\" to make the home smart. Unfortunately too smart. The wife could not operate the devices in her own home.She had the tenacity to handle living in a dark house. All the time; she just gave up on the lights -- she couldn&#x27;t figure it out and lived like this for an entire year.She finally called for help when lights started randomly turning on and off. She believed it was the spirit of her late husband, but after some diagnostics, we found some cross-channel noise from a home further down the block. Whenever this neighbor would come home, he would turn on his lights via his home automation. About 75% of the time, it would turn on our lady&#x27;s lights too. In her bedroom. And the neighbor worked 3rd shift.I spend the next two days removing all home automation devices and, as she put it, putting in \"turn the light on and off again\" switches.When choosing technology -- any technology, it&#x27;s important to consider the life of that device and the people impacted far in the future. reply jchw 15 hours agoparentOf course you can have your cake and eat it too. If you were to throw away the Raspberry Pi in my house that runs home assistant, all of the switches on the wall would continue to work. This is possible by switching in smart switches instead of smart bulbs. For RGB bulb controls, Zigbee pairing can make the operation of the remote controls independent of the hub to some degree, though I&#x27;m not 100% confident that those will function properly without the hub since then there&#x27;s no coordinator (right?) reply jdminhbg 13 hours agorootparentThank you. I am not sure why so many people have this impression that if you install smart home stuff you can&#x27;t have switches that Just Work. My garage door has a smart opener and also a physical switch inside the garage and a key fob remote in the kitchen drawer, they all work just fine.

Thank you for sharing that.This is one of the reasons that smart bulbs and the like are generally bad - you never want a situation where the switch doesn&#x27;t just act like a switch.Smart houses should be designed from the perspective of remaining identical to use when the smarts go away. And if there&#x27;s weird behavior it should all stop if you unplug the hub or controller.I generally like in-wall smart switches but even there they tend to die faster than dumb switches, so you may be leaving your survivors a bunch of calls to an electrician. reply petsfed 15 hours agorootparentI feel like \"if your internet-connected X doesn&#x27;t do regular internet-less X-things without the internet, its not an X\" should be the core axiom of IoT design. reply ncallaway 13 hours agorootparentYep, my goals are largely two-fold:- \"Everything &#x27;smart&#x27; must continue to function if the internet is disconnected\"- \"Everything &#x27;smart&#x27; must fall-back to normal &#x27;dumb&#x27; operation if the automation server is not available\" reply harry8 5 hours agorootparent>- \"Everything &#x27;smart&#x27; must fall-back to normal &#x27;dumb&#x27; operation...immediately, every single time the occupant wants it to do that.

In my house I have the smarts in the switch itself wherever possible, but so much of my lighting is from floor and table lamps (that aren&#x27;t plugged into switched outlets). In those cases, the bulb is the only thing I can \"smarten\", and it still will work via the stem on the lamp itself if the HA box goes away.The main drawback is that this means I have to have the bulbs set to light up after power is restored. A middle-of-the-night power outage is fun when the entire house lights up at 3am :)I&#x27;ve done a few new installs of lighting in my garage, driveway, and patio. Because that was \"greenfield\" work, I got to put smart switches in. If I ever rewire this house, I&#x27;ll use that opportunity to do some more. reply brewdad 13 hours agorootparentHave you looked at smart plugs? I have a few lamps in my home plugged into them and the automation works fine. I have a couple spares I store with the Xmas stuff so that the lights can be automated once the decorations are up.I use Kasa (TP-Link) plugs but there are a bunch of different brands. reply function_seven 11 hours agorootparentI have, yeah. A couple years ago I got a bunch of Tasmota-flashable ones, and I use them for the coffeemaker, a couple stereos, and one table lamp. Oh yeah, and the christmas lights. :)My issue with those is that they fail the \"normal person\" test. A normal person will try to turn on a lamp and it will never work because the smart plug is off. But with a smart bulb, it&#x27;ll come on after they twist the stem a couple times. (And it never gets noticed! People are used to 3-way style lamp sockets needing a couple clicks to turn regular bulbs on and off, so they don&#x27;t really notice that they had to double twist the stem to get the light to turn on) reply briHass 10 hours agorootparentOf course, now you have the opposite problem: someone turns the bulb off with the lamp knob (unaware of&#x2F;irritated with its smart features), and now it&#x27;s unresponsive with all smart controls.The best compromise are smart switches. Switch still manually controls the light, and smart features are always available. The downsides are that the lamp&#x27;s outlet must have switch wiring, and smart switches aren&#x27;t like normal toggles: they&#x27;re more like push buttons so the switch isn&#x27;t in a strange physical state. reply function_seven 10 hours agorootparentHaha, yup. No matter what method I choose, I give something up. I agree switches are usually the best, but it gets more complicated when I want to have configurable color temp and dimmability in the same fixture. Can&#x27;t use a dimmer switch, because the smart bulb wants full power. Or I can use a dimmer that&#x27;s operating as basically a remote for the bulb rather than a true current-interrupting switch. But now it needs to be able to fall back to real switch mode if the hub is offline.(By the way, Philips Warm Glow bulbs are awesome for this. I use them in my dining room lamp connected to an Inovelli Z-wave dimmer. They get warmer the dimmer they go, mimicking how tungsten filaments work)My current setup is a mix-n-match of all three types, using each one where it beats the other two for simplicity and predictability. replyitslennysfault 15 hours agorootparentprevThe default on Hue bulbs is to reset to mid-bright white when first turned on. This means whenever you flip the switch on the light turns on, and obviously if you turn the switch off the light turns off. So, they essentially do let the switch be a switch by default. reply nirav72 14 hours agoparentprevAlong that same line - My Home-automation setup is fairly simple using Samsung&#x27;s hub and requires very little maintenance.

Most HA stuff is part of a \"generation\" of tech. What people don&#x27;t realize is that in about 15-20 years, all buzzwords&#x2F;acronyms&#x2F;techstacks will likely be completely different.Home stuff needs to generally work for 20 years, and lot of things (light switches, etc) will be even longer. Tech has no conception or demonstrated discipline for functioning that long.HA&#x2F;IOT is an interop disaster currently, and the current cacaphony of standards&#x2F;acronymns guarantees it will be cycled&#x2F;replaced in a decade&#x27;s time.The INTER-NET of Things doesn&#x27;t have a functional INTER, nor a NET.Inter is software, which should be mathematically doable but historically improbable.The ubiquitous NET part basically means you buy the device, and it will work with zero-config networking that means you can find it.And the final issue is the interface.

The situation really sucks to a surprisingly great extent. At the same time though, it has to be stated that going for a &#x27;dumb, simple&#x27; Smart Lights really, really misses an enormous amount of the potential value. Nearly 100% of my smart home is about lights for now using just Philips Hue&#x2F;HomeKit, though HA remains on my list, but only a tiny percentage is about simply having switches wherever. The true value for me has been in more intelligent color lighting based on layered actions. I change the amount of blue and brightness during the course of the day, so that there&#x27;s lots in the morning and it&#x27;s dimmer and ever redder in the evening. Particularly in the winter this has been incredibly helpful for my sleep cycles. It can all be extremely transparent as well since the switches and motion sensors can have time-of-day as well as which-button and number-of-clicks categorization. So hitting the on button always turns the lights on, but the color and brightness mix of a room will be different over the course of the day. Same with outdoors, motion sensors anywhere that can have different colors and activation periods at different times has been great for massively cutting down extraneous blue light at night, which is good not just for humans but for animals and insects as well. I can wake up in the heart of winter when the sun doesn&#x27;t rise until 8 or later in the morning to a 20 minute long \"sunrise\" I created myself simulated nicely with a bunch of lights. And more complex logic like \"lights all come on when smoke alarm goes off or a basement flood is detected\" are also handy.Again I&#x27;m very sympathetic to the shitty state of the ecosystems right now, frequently miserable UI&#x2F;UX, and massive heaping doses of bullshit companies are constantly trying to pull to extract more ongoing revenue from people for what should be buy-once-and-done products.

If you live near the equator with consistent sunrise&#x2F;sunset year round artificial light management may be less of a concern to you, but the further you are and the more seasonal variation you experience the more helpful it may be (and is for me) to have lighting throughout home&#x2F;work that can help maintain circadian rhythm as desired. \"Sunrise\" into bright white&#x2F;blue in the morning and day, then slowly changing into dimmer, redder light as one approaches the desired time to go to sleep. YMMV of course but as someone in tech who had decades of difficulty in maintaining a normal 24h cycle in the northern latitudes, heavy light brightness and temperature control has been a very significant improvement in my QOL and I never want to go back.Of course, some people just enjoy having fun with lighting as well, for parties and mood and such. \"Painting with light\" can be interesting by itself. But for me the practical advantages have been significant value for the cost, and without any need for any kind of drugs or other mechanisms.----0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webmd.com&#x2F;sleep-disorders&#x2F;sleep-blue-light1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;staying-healthy&#x2F;blue-light-ha...2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC9424753&#x2F; reply Symmetry 14 hours agorootparentprevHigh color temperature in the morning to wake you up versus low temperature in the night to let you get to sleep quickly is the main benefit. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentprevthey&#x27;re fun! they help set the mood, so the living room changes from an office space vibe to a campfire vibe to a cool outer space feel. it&#x27;s goes beyond strictly utilitarian uses but you have to have emotions to get use out of that feature. reply tippytippytango 6 hours agorootparentprevI have a bladerunner&#x2F;Tokyo nights mode I can put my apartment in, I love it. reply IanCal 14 hours agorootparentprevOther than fun, being able to shift lights in the kids bedrooms to a more yellow hue for storytime then a dark red for a nightlight has been good. reply brewdad 13 hours agorootparentWhen my teen would be up in his room with headphones on, I would flash the bedroom lights remotely from downstairs.

The useful things (to me) come from integrating several different devices together - for example:- If I&#x27;ve been out (defined by my phone&#x27;s wifi connection or alarm arming state) and then come home and turn on the light nearest my front door, all the lights in my house will turn on (at a predefined brightness level according to time of day)- When I start a TV show&#x2F;movie&#x2F;etc on the TV (but only in the evening), the lights in the room where the TV is will dim. If I pause, they get a bit brighter. Switch the TV off and they get fully bright.- If I&#x27;m watching TV or listening to music and get a phone call, the TV&#x2F;music automatically pauses- When I leave the house, all the house lights get switched off automatically in case I forgot to switch any off (again based on phone wifi connection and&#x2F;or alarm arming state - my alarm state is one-way so HA can&#x27;t control the alarm, only the other way around)- If someone leaves the bathroom light on for too long, it will automatically switch off- In the morning, the lights in my bedroom dim up very gradually to help me wake up (with timing and whether it happens linked to my calendar so it happens later at weekends or during school holidays when I don&#x27;t need to help with the school run)- I get a notification on my phone when my washing machine&#x2F;tumble drier are done which means I don&#x27;t forget to unload&#x2F;reload themI also use HA to unify energy sensors (which are then sent into a Victoria Metrics instance) to monitor the energy usage of various things in my house - this has been pretty helpful to identify where I should prioritise trying to save energy.All of this is done locally&#x2F;without cloud services and I think I&#x27;ve probably just scratched the surface of what&#x27;s possible so far - eg I don&#x27;t have my heating&#x2F;AC&#x2F;blinds&#x2F;curtains integrated into HA so far and I also plan to investigate whether I could usefully adjust the \"wake-up time\" in my HA setup depending on traffic&#x2F;public transport status.All of these things are of course possible manually and my guiding principle has always been that if the HA instance isn&#x27;t running then nothing should stop working - but the automations do make life a lot more pleasant. reply harry8 5 hours agorootparentgot a write-up of it someplace?The music quiet when phone call thing is particularly attractive.

But to get music to pause when the phone rings I use the Spotify integration and HA companion app. It&#x27;s a pretty simple automation - it has one trigger when \"Phone state\" changes to \"ringing\", one condition that Spotify is playing, and one action which sets Spotify to paused.I think the \"ringing\" state provided by the companion app only works on Android, not iOS though.OwnTone has an HA integration so I would expect you can do something similar with that. reply harry8 7 minutes agorootparentPresently loathing an iphone rather than hating an android so i guess I’m out of luck.HA Owntone integration works very well as does shairport-sync & its mqtt interface.

I re-installed it. A couple of months later, it auto-updated itself and decided to lock me out because apparently it now required that you log in where it previously didn&#x27;t. At around the same time, Apple locked out their HomeKit HA integration so I could no longer tell Siri to flip the lights. At that point I just gave up.Recently I tried reinstalling it again, and let&#x27;s just say I don&#x27;t recommend it if you value your sanity.Every time I look into HA, I face this kind of cognitive dissonance between my experience and people condescendingly telling me that I&#x27;m obviously doing something wrong.I just want a zwave hub for my light switches.

Google random forums to find out what people think of this decision first I guess.I mean I think it’s still a good product, don’t get me wrong, but it is still very much a power user thing.Which is probably fine because setting up HA itself when you have an install isn’t exactly a picnic either. reply MattGrommes 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s changed but I felt like a super genius a few years ago when I finally got my HA up and running on a pi, and I&#x27;m a linux person and former system admin.

External cameras tracking people, cars, and planes that fly overhead would be the Sensor Array. Since houses don&#x27;t move, you could say there&#x27;s no engineering. But if I had a power generation system like a solar panel, we&#x27;ll just make that engineering. I&#x27;d be able to \"redirect power\" when we have a heat wave. Each system would have an API that reports stats that you can culminate into a daily dashboard displayed on your bathroom mirror. Of course, the Alexas would be \"computer\", and a lounge dedicated to AR&#x2F;VR would be the \"Holodeck\".I imagine that&#x27;s what most people have in their heads, but we get lost in the weeds. In reality, I haven&#x27;t done much home automation myself. Just a few lights, ecobee thermostat, and alexa that I don&#x27;t use.Having to pull out my phone just to control these things is often too much friction. Asking Alexa to do it is rather nice, but I&#x27;m not thrilled about the prospect of a company listening in (rumored to anyway).

At the same time, if your bulb \"state\" is off, your light switch won&#x27;t be able to turn it on.You could JUST pair a smart bulb with a smart switch, and align their states.

    "originLink": "https://12factor.net/",
    "originBody": "The Twelve-Factor App Introduction In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that: Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project; Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments; Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration; Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility; And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices. The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc). Background The contributors to this document have been directly involved in the development and deployment of hundreds of apps, and indirectly witnessed the development, operation, and scaling of hundreds of thousands of apps via our work on the Heroku platform. This document synthesizes all of our experience and observations on a wide variety of software-as-a-service apps in the wild. It is a triangulation on ideal practices for app development, paying particular attention to the dynamics of the organic growth of an app over time, the dynamics of collaboration between developers working on the app’s codebase, and avoiding the cost of software erosion. Our motivation is to raise awareness of some systemic problems we’ve seen in modern application development, to provide a shared vocabulary for discussing those problems, and to offer a set of broad conceptual solutions to those problems with accompanying terminology. The format is inspired by Martin Fowler’s books Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture and Refactoring. Who should read this document? Any developer building applications which run as a service. Ops engineers who deploy or manage such applications. The Twelve Factors I. Codebase One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys II. Dependencies Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies III. Config Store config in the environment IV. Backing services Treat backing services as attached resources V. Build, release, run Strictly separate build and run stages VI. Processes Execute the app as one or more stateless processes VII. Port binding Export services via port binding VIII. Concurrency Scale out via the process model IX. Disposability Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown X. Dev/prod parity Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible XI. Logs Treat logs as event streams XII.

For example:> Another approach to config is the use of config files which are not checked into revision control, such as config&#x2F;database.yml in Rails. This is a huge improvement over using constants which are checked into the code repo, but still has weaknesses: it’s easy to mistakenly check in a config file to the repo; there is a tendency for config files to be scattered about in different places and different formats, making it hard to see and manage all the config in one place. Further, these formats tend to be language- or framework-specific.> The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables (often shortened to env vars or env).yeah the reason they argue for this is that the people that wrote this worked on Heroku, and the way that Heroku worked is you populated the environment variables from some fields in a web app. If you want your config history tracked in version control, or you do gitops, or you have k8s configmaps, or you want to have your configuration files on a mounted volume ... those things are all broadly fine; they keep the configuration state separate from the app deploy state. This document really confuses the forest with the trees and recommends things based less on actual engineering principles and more on the product capabilities of the corporation that produced it. It is an actively harmful set of guidelines. reply jbotdev 18 hours agoparentIt is true that this is somewhat influenced by how Heroku works, but ConfigMaps and GitOps do not meet the same security and usability requirements as Heroku config&#x2F;env vars.If you want secure config storage on Kubernetes, you end up using Secrets, which ends up being key-value like env vars anyway. If you want similar security with Git you need a layer of encryption, which breaks diffs and requires additional tooling. This all leads back to why high-level deployment tools like Heroku were created. reply campbel 18 hours agorootparent> If you want secure config storage on Kubernetes, you end up using Secrets, which ends up being key-value like env vars anyway.You can load the secret file directly into the app, no need to load it as env vars or keep it strictly as key-value pairs.> If you want similar security with Git you need a layer of encryption, which breaks diffs and requires additional tooling. This all leads back to why high-level deployment tools like Heroku were created.You can use tools like ejson[1] or sops[2] to get encrypted files checked into Git that have key level granularity on diffs.There is definitely a place for higher level abstractions than Kubernetes.

The intent is for the app to consume the secrets but have no knowledge or care where they came from.Edit: misread as \"load the secrets directly into the app.\" Yeah, this is just env vars but different. reply derefr 17 hours agorootparentMy trick for this with k8s Secrets, when there&#x27;s some sort of config file that absolutely must be consumed from disk, is to1. create a Secret that defines the file as a key2. mount that Secret into the container (.secret.secretName in the volume definition) under an arbitrary conventional path, e.g. &#x2F;secrets3. define an env-var that gives the full path to the file; where the fallback when this env-var isn&#x27;t defined is to find the file in the working directory with a conventional filename.If your own code uses the file, it can read the path from this env-var; while if the core of your container is some opaque tool that doesn&#x27;t know about the env-var but does take the file&#x27;s path on the command-line, then you can wrap the tool in an entrypoint script that reads the env-var and passes it as a command-line arg to the tool.IMHO, this approach is flexible but principle-of-least-surprise obeying for both development and production deployment. reply inferiorhuman 16 hours agorootparentThat sounds an awful lot like a .env file to me. reply pojzon 15 hours agorootparentyup thats exactly what .env is, and tbh that doesn&#x27;t change anything in the bigger picture reply derefr 12 hours agorootparentprev...no? It&#x27;s the opposite.A .env file allows you to go from knowing&#x2F;assuming where a particular file is, to having environment variables.What I&#x27;m describing is that you can go from being passed environment variables directly, to knowing where certain files are; which therefore allows those files to be mounted into a container-image in arbitrary places, rather than encoding brittle assumptions about config-file locations into the binary within the container-image — assumptions that usually get in the way during development, when you&#x27;re not running the binary inside a container. reply inferiorhuman 5 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;dotenvy&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dotenvy&#x2F;fn.from_filename.html reply kagakuninja 16 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t use kubernates. We have JVM servers running on AWS. We load secrets from Secrets Manager. Configs are mostly HOCON files stored in S3.

Let the orchestrator deal with reading and storing it.- Configuration in the environment. Apps tend to pull config from different sources depending on the deploy - maybe a .env locally and a secret store in production.- Port binding - your app listens on a port and you put nginx or whatever in front of it and set up a reverse proxy. K8S services and ingress do that.I think the biggest criticism you can lay down on 12 Factor these days is that it&#x27;s not actually written very well and assumes you know exactly what it is talking about. reply rbanffy 13 hours agorootparent> - Logs as a stream: yep, just write your logs to STDOUT instead of a file.

This has been in use long before Heroku existed. I’ll give Heroku credit for making it common knowledge and spreading the use of these concepts, though. reply zemo 16 hours agorootparentyeah I never suggested that heroku invented environment variables, and the idea that environment variables weren&#x27;t common knowledge before heroku came along is ... let&#x27;s say at best revisionist. reply wutwutwat 16 hours agorootparentTrue.If you remember the world before 12 factor you know that even if motivated by self serving incentives, Heroku making this mainstream has been an overall win for the entire industry and we are generally better and more secure for them having done so. We are still benefitting from all of this today, and Heroku who championed it is making death rattles. reply hirako2000 15 hours agorootparentWhile valid points in many contexts, I&#x27;ve seen many other contexts where following this principle&#x2F;pattern a&#x2F; yields none of its benefits b&#x2F; results in very significant business impact.Here is some obvious case observed many times.A small and very fast pace team builds a server application having limited to no external dependencies. No db even.Just a server doing stuff.It does have some config yes, many many key&#x2F;value pairs even, a config file ended up with a dozen properties just to control Req per sec limits and such.Now just to deploy the thing, since of course env defined configurations is where things belong in best practice, the dev team setup a process to peer review those env values and despite all of that, fail to get the app running.Human errors happen but since more mistakes and release delays were caused by misconfiguration than any other reasons, the keen and bright enginnering team all agreed it would be better to have a config repo. One genius in the group argued that having a config service would be even neater than have the app read from a git repo! The whole got so hyped and of course spend the whole next sprint building and testing that. Brilliant, it worked!Except that of course outages happened, of course. Outages happen.Bringing down all environments one by one, hence blocking pretty much everyone. Everything went down because hey, since we made that effort which took for longer than we thought to build a config service and have our app reads from it, one of the dev minds thought it was a genius idea to have the app reload the config every 5 mins at runtime so that if a configuration change was made, no need to even restart anything. Of course error handling wasn&#x27;t robust and well tested since the boss reminded the team we&#x27;ve got to ship a product by the end of the quarter and solving the universe can maybe wait 5 or 10 years after the IPO.Team resorted to simply track the config in the repo. Kept the runtime reload of the config and things worked just fine.Things can be done right and impacts could have been avoided. The example may seem like a twisted case since these were all configurations, not environment specific values. But I&#x27;ve just seen so many occurences of env variables being separated from the application repo costing so much and distracting contributors for no benefit that I have grown very cautious of it. reply ElevenLathe 14 hours agorootparentThe intent of this part of 12 Factor comes from the Bad Old Days when devs didn&#x27;t run their own stuff in production. There was a dev team who could push code and cut releases, and an ops team who would then deploy the releases, and who was paged when things blew up.If you store the database hostname&#x2F;credentials, as an example, in the \"code\" (either literally in the app code, or in a config.ini that lives in the repo and gets baked into a release), then the ops people can&#x27;t quickly repoint the app at a hot-spare database during an incident: they&#x27;ll need to edit the repo, push it, cut a new release, etc. If there is a long build step (as for a C++ app, for example), then this isn&#x27;t really tenable during an outage. If this is in an environment variable, their normal deployment scripts can make the change for them.I agree that this is probably not necessary anymore if your team is all wearing both hats (dev and ops), and its just as quick to make an edit to the repo and cut&#x2F;deploy a new release as it would have been for the Ops team to run their deployment script in the old days. replyrbanffy 16 hours agoparentprev\"Store config in the environment\" does not necessarily mean configs are in environment variables - it only means configuration comes from the hosting environment, not the application itself - you are not adding a \"settings.json\" file to your machine before starting the app.This way, the same source deployed in, i.e. your AKS cluster in Azure EU north will take the configuration you set for that cluster while the one you run out of an Docker Swarm of RPi Zero&#x27;s in an Ikea photo frame (I have one cluster like that, called Gibson), will take the configuration from that cluster. reply Kwpolska 16 hours agorootparentThe page https:&#x2F;&#x2F;12factor.net&#x2F;config disagrees with you:> The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables (often shortened to env vars or env). reply rbanffy 16 hours agorootparentI would assume that is the interpretation back in 2011.

And that&#x27;s fine. I use them for that purpose all the time. I would not willingly consent to using them to manage environment variables in production. But I would also not willingly consent to doing it the way that&#x27;s best for production during development.I think that&#x27;s fine. 12-factor is a set of guidelines about what you do in production.

Curious what your take on that is. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentLoading environment variables from a .env file if it exists is no different between development and production.You just set the variables at startup in prod, and in the file on development (probably mostly because you want to change them all the time). reply stackskipton 9 hours agorootparentprevOps person here. .env files at best should be injected into Developer environment by IDE&#x2F;Editor. Many IDE&#x2F;editors have this feature along with Docker. If that&#x27;s not an option (Thanks JetBrains&#x2F;Visual Studio), second thing is something like Python-dotenv where library loads .env file at startup, injects them into environment variables and rest of the code is configured to use environment variables. This behavior could even be environment variable controlled and should not error if no .env file is present. reply scooble 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve read a bunch of tutorials promoting env vars to avoid secrets being accidentally checked into git.

At one company I worked, .env files for the DEV environment were open (the file itself was stored on Vault, so only engineers had access to it), and one could only access DEV resources via VPN. So, starting a service using the DEV .env file was rather easy an uncomplicated. reply throw1234651234 16 hours agorootparentHere is the problem with that. A dev pushes a change that requires a change to the env file. Another dev pulls down the code, but doesn&#x27;t change the env file. Everything breaks. At really bad companies, DevOps sets env vars from somewhere other than that file passed around by devs - another failure point.My proposal:1. Key VaultHashiCorp Vaultwhatever is the source of truth for secrets.2. When a developer adds a key, they add it to Key Vault and update code to use it.3. On app startup, code checks the dev&#x27;s local for 2 env vars ONLY, which allow access to key vault.4. The app then tries to pull in all the env vars it needs by secret name.5. If any are missing, it fails.This keeps devs from having to pass around .env files outside of source control. Btw, Azure (and all other cloud) builds can be configured to pull env vars directly from Key Vault, so there&#x27;s that benefit too. reply victorNicollet 2 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s an optional but very helpful sixth step: expose the loaded configuration (by pushing it to the logs, or as a &#x2F;_config endpoint). For secrets, obviously don&#x27;t expose the secret value itself, but do expose the vault address, secret identifier, and which version of the secret was loaded. This helps check that an application isn&#x27;t using an outdated version of a secret. reply ATMLOTTOBEER 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is the workflow my company uses.

You can&#x27;t reverse \"cow -> burger -> sewage\" and shouldn&#x27;t expect some magic hadoop to reverse entropy without a ton of work.So -- I guess the 12 factor app dictum is fine for some trivial \"I rewrote twitter in 80 lines of erlang\" app, but in my opinion it is a \"if we can land a man on the moon we can land a man on the sun\" misstatement of complexity in actually getting things done in the real world.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercritical.co&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-plumber-problem reply jeremyjh 18 hours agorootparentThe reason people pay outrageous prices for Splunk is you can get some pretty decent burgers out of sewage if you know what you are doing, and from personal experience the results can be totally game-changing if you are stuck with a mishmash of different log formats and have to support a large distributed application. reply morelisp 18 hours agorootparentprevSpoken like someone who has never had to work on a Java application with 22 custom log files, not including stdout, stderr, and two separate syslogs.Yes, if you want useful data from logs you&#x27;ll need to log useful data, but this is a case where 12 factor is so successful &#x2F; dominant today I don&#x27;t think you even know what it&#x27;s arguing against anymore. reply jameshart 11 hours agorootparent> this is a case where 12 factor is so successful &#x2F; dominant today I don&#x27;t think you even know what it&#x27;s arguing against anymoreThank you!

It should not attempt to write to or manage logfiles. Instead, each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to stdout. During local development, the developer will view this stream in the foreground of their terminal to observe the app’s behavior.That guidance is deeply foolish; I have to assume the rest of the guidance is just as silly for anything but a toy application. reply lexicality 15 hours agorootparentWhere does it say \"unformatted\"? All it says is that your logs should be sent to stdout.You write your logs in whatever structure you want and have something in the runtime environment (k8s, systemd, file redirection in bash whatever) forward them to the eventual storage location. I don&#x27;t see the issue. reply cduzz 14 hours agorootparentSo -- there&#x27;s a file, that&#x27;s created by some something in a container emitting a string of bytes. A file must go through a parsing and serialization phase to be useful to a logging infrastructure. Just because you decorate the contents of that file with { and } and other punctuation doesn&#x27;t make that file a string of json records, until something&#x27;s read and verified it.I&#x27;m supposed to just load it into memory hoping it&#x27;s json or avro or whatever? Nope, errors happen; there&#x27;s a limit to the number of bytes that can be sent from one place to another before the kernel may interrupt it (you&#x27;re writing an application log and your runtime emits it&#x27;s own debugging message; they get intermingled because they&#x27;re both being written to a fifo).Maybe this is fine (usually it&#x27;s fine) but eventually it isn&#x27;t fine. Use a logging library, categories your logs, maybe start off with stdout but eventually put on some big person pants and use a logging api and use the stderr&#x2F;stdout for high cardinality exceptions, not \"all my logs\" reply lexicality 13 hours agorootparentJust so I understand, you are saying that the entire concept of the 12 factor app is bogus because it tells you to write unformatted logs to stdout because anything you write to stdout is by its very nature unformatted because even if you&#x27;re outputting formatted data something else in your program might decide to concurrently write into your stdout buffer while you&#x27;re writing a log line and that will corrupt your entire data stream irreparably? reply cduzz 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m saying that, the one thing I know about looks like obvious nonsense -- \"write your logs to stdout and let someone else sort it out\" -- so I assume the rest of it is equally facile and silly.So now, when I see a reference to \"12 factor app\" I assume \"ah, a hello world app from someone who&#x27;s going to leave and let someone else figure out how to make it work in the real world at real loads with real regulatory or compliance needs\"In other words, for me, it&#x27;s a shibboleth for \"toy\" or \"unserious piece of shit\"There may, in fact, be parts of the guidance that aren&#x27;t deeply incorrect. But anyone who points at it as a way to do things, without caveats, is suspect. reply jameshart 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not &#x27;someone else&#x27;. It&#x27;s whatever environment the application ends up running in.The idea of 12 factor is to define a reasonable interface for your application. The environment doesn&#x27;t need to worry about providing interfaces to logging services or collecting files from a custom directory, or making sure the application isn&#x27;t going to fill the disk with log output - if the app is 12 factor, the only thing the environment needs to do is collect stdout.As a 12 factor app, write such that what you put on stdout is useful for that purpose.As a system hosting 12 factor apps, collect stdout and put it somewhere useful.As a developer of a 12 factor app, when you want to see your log output, go wherever the environment puts it and look there.That&#x27;s a useful contract that works at scale. Not sure why you think it doesn&#x27;t. reply jameshart 13 hours agorootparentprev12 factor does not say ‘don’t use a logging library’Use a logging library. Configure it to output well formed and categorized log messages to stdout. Let the runtime environment take that stream of data from there. reply cduzz 9 hours agorootparentIt certainly doesn&#x27;t say \"use a logging library\"it says: A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream. It should not attempt to write to or manage logfiles. Instead, each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to stdout. During local development, the developer will view this stream in the foreground of their terminal to observe the app’s behavior.In staging or production deploys, each process’ stream will be captured by the execution environment, collated together with all other streams from the app, and routed to one or more final destinations for viewing and long-term archival. These archival destinations are not visible to or configurable by the app, and instead are completely managed by the execution environment. Open-source log routers (such as Logplex and Fluentd) are available for this purpose.The event stream for an app can be routed to a file, or watched via realtime tail in a terminal. Most significantly, the stream can be sent to a log indexing and analysis system such as Splunk, or a general-purpose data warehousing system such as Hadoop&#x2F;Hive. These systems allow for great power and flexibility for introspecting an app’s behavior over time, including:This is, at scale, utter horseshit. If it said \"do what&#x27;s expedient, but use a library and be flexible in how you generate logs, but for goodness sake use any of the publicly available libraries to be expedient now and reliable and flexible later\" I&#x27;d shrug and move on, but it&#x27;s just absolute garbage. \"Do a shitty job and someone else will fix it for you\" is not good advice, even if it lets you get to market quickly. reply jameshart 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s clear you haven&#x27;t actually taken the time to understand what 12 factor is saying, and you&#x27;re assuming that anything left unsaid is an implied permission to just screw everything up.A more reasonable reading of 12 factor is to see that since it suggests that the output streams should be gathered up from multiple running instances of the application, and collated together in a system like splunk, that it behooves you as a 12 factor app developer to build your app such that your output stream is amenable to that approach.I.e., that your output is a stream of structured serialized data.You haven&#x27;t clarified what you think is a better practice than this. reply lmm 7 hours agorootparentprev> It certainly doesn&#x27;t say \"use a logging library\"Right. It&#x27;s not telling you anything about whether to use a library or not. All it&#x27;s talking about is where you output your logging streams to, not about how you produce or format those streams. Is it bad advice because it doesn&#x27;t tell you you should wear sunscreen when you go outside in summer?(FWIW I haven&#x27;t seen any logging library add enough value to be worthwhile. Eventually graduating to structured event logs is a good idea, but having started with a logging library doesn&#x27;t actually get you any closer to that). replyjameshart 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat 12 factor is telling you to do is to not build a log file rotator into your application.It is the least controversial and most broadly beneficial of the 12 factors.Why do you think it’s foolish? reply cduzz 14 hours agorootparentIt says \"send it to stdout and let someone else figure it out.\"As that someone else, who often has bug reports like \"why aren&#x27;t my log events all in one record in my thing? Because you filled your stdout with newlines!\" \"Why did my message vanish? It was important!\" \"because it&#x27;s malformed json because your runtime had an error; it&#x27;s over there instead of over here.\"Programming&#x27;s a stack of details; all of which matter. Log using a logging API where available; use stdout&#x2F;stderr for exception logging only, if at all possible. If you want your logging to be useful, think carefully about how and what you log. reply jameshart 13 hours agorootparentThat’s a total misreading of what 12 factor is about.All it means is to let someone else (other than the program itself) figure out how to get the log messages (whatever you decide they should be) from your process (running wherever it is) to wherever you want to have those logs for inspection.Do not hardcode into your application the assumption that they are written to a file or sent to a port.In your application, write them to stdout.In local dev, stdout will probably go to an interactive console. In a container running in a cloud hosted cluster it will probably go to a networked log aggregator that collects it all into an indexed time oriented data store along with other logs from other running instances.Because you used stdout, that’s easy to do.If you wrote them to a file whose name your application manages and changes itself to manage log rotation… either of those is hard to do. replyAurornis 18 hours agorootparentprev> Give an example.I can give an example. The part about sticky sessions is good generic advice for someone building generic web services, but there are situations where sticky session-like functionality or sharding-like behavior might be a better choice. Anyone adhering literally to the 12-factor guide would get hung up on trying to move that data to redis or memcached:> Some web systems rely on “sticky sessions” – that is, caching user session data in memory of the app’s process and expecting future requests from the same visitor to be routed to the same process. Sticky sessions are a violation of twelve-factor and should never be used or relied upon. Session state data is a good candidate for a datastore that offers time-expiration, such as Memcached or Redis.The guide also has a strong preference for languages like Ruby, Perl, and Python. There’s even a quip about how 12-factor prefers languages with a REPL, which in the wrong hands becomes an argument against using Rust or other languages.People who think the entire world is simple CRUD web apps tend to think that guides like this are completely universal.

If your app can gracefully recover to a reasonable state from a failure to resume the expected session, then you could argue it&#x27;s not that reliant on it. Many systems use sticky sessions as simply as an optimization, which is fine.You didn&#x27;t actually give an complete example. When are sticky sessions a better choice than persistence? reply brodouevencode 18 hours agoparentprevNo amount of dogma should interfere with a deployment within the scope of an MVP. Once it&#x27;s out of MVP then anything not addressed best practice-wise is tech debt. If your organization had adopted 12FA as a set of best practices then those should be met, but they should never interfere with a deployment.12FA is not a single box that is to be checked. It can and in most cases probably should be implemented over time as the product matures, taking each point, point by point (and maybe even breaking those up) and adding that into the product. If you&#x27;ve done good engineering up front (abstractions and interfaces where it makes sense, not hard coding everything) this should not be an issue.inb4 YAGNI: this is just as abused as 12FA.EDIT: the biggest thing 12FA is missing are concrete examples that junior engineers can reference. reply Waterluvian 19 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve had issues like that before.

One app - one repo. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with multiple apps (as in separate pods&#x2F;containers&#x2F;processes) being developed in a single repo, as long as they are tightly coupled functionally, share the release cycle, but still need to be deployed separately to get advantages of separate processes and independent scaling. The first example that comes to mind is separation of public api and worker processes, e.g. ruby&#x27;s sidekiq, python&#x27;s celery or a generic kafka consumer.2. > A twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages.This is incredibly hard to achieve in practice if you&#x27;re not running something nix, and even then there are leaks of dependencies on kernel syscall APIs. Every Rust app implicitly depends on a glibc (except musl ones), which is present in major Linux distros except slim ones such as Alpine. In fact, the whole Docker crutch IMO is needed specifically to alleviate this problem.3. > The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variablesIt seems to me much more brittle, as it forces you to store secrets in envs, which could be less secure, and to abandon structured file configs, which may enjoy type safety, IDE autocomplete and automatic parsing. With envs you are forced to implement parses for non-trivial and non-string config vars yourself. In fact, envs are often committed into repos as well in form of dot-env files, so the point about commit-safety is moot as well. reply twic 19 hours agoparent> This is incredibly hard to achieve in practice if you&#x27;re not running something nix, and even then there are leaks of dependencies on kernel syscall APIs.You&#x27;re misinterpreting that guideline. The text says (my emphasis):> Most programming languages offer a packaging system for distributing support libraries, such as CPAN for Perl or Rubygems for Ruby. Libraries installed through a packaging system can be installed system-wide (known as “site packages”)It&#x27;s not saying not to depend on the operating system (of which glibc is part), it&#x27;s saying not to require particular language package manager packages to be installed on the machine.Agreed that the other ones you mention are silly, though. Especially the one about environment variables - that isn&#x27;t actually reasoned advice, it was just the authors writing down what was most common in Ruby development at the time, on the assumption that that must be the best thing to do. reply aniforprez 18 hours agorootparentIn my experience, sourcing config from env variables seems like the best thing to do because you can completely ignore where the app is running in favor of injecting whatever you want in any environment of your choosing and your app no longer needs to care about that. The implication is that business logic must not include the content of your config or where it is sourced from. It must simply use the values in the config. This way my apps could give less of a fart if I run it as a container in kube, in nomad, in local on localhost, in a devcontainer, in a directory with vars loaded using direnv, in vercel&#x2F;netlify and so on. This also allows incredible flexibility in how that config is sourced as long as you simply dump them into the env vars. Want to load secrets from a .env file on local? Sure. Want to load secrets from Vault on production? Run a simple script to load vault secrets onto the env and run your app. reply dalyons 17 hours agorootparentyeah this is the actual point - it makes the code&#x2F;app totally portable & decoupled from config. I find it significantly better than having to have the app code choose different config based on interrogating facts about its runtime (eg am i in prod? use this value. am i in test? use this) reply twic 12 hours agorootparentEverything you both wrote is spot on - but there&#x27;s nothing about it which means you have to use environment variables! All of those mechanisms could be used with any other means of delivering the config at the point of process invocation - a config file, command line arguments, YAML to standard input, whatever.Personally, i would pick a config file over environment variables any day: easier to manually inspect and tweak, easier to give structure to, doesn&#x27;t get implicitly passed down to subprocesses, can be secured with familiar file permissions, etc. reply stackskipton 8 hours agorootparentProblem with config files is you are forced to process it properly in pipeline so it can be delivered during deploy AND depending on your runtime environment, you might have to redeploy to change things.Environment variables exist on just about EVERY runtime, changed without requiring a pipeline run.However, subprocess is interesting but I&#x27;ve never run into subprocess that is not sharing a config. Where I worked, if you have subprocess that can&#x27;t see those configs, you create a new service. reply jjice 18 hours agorootparentprevI heavily agree. I used to work on a LAMP stack where the deployment was just dumping the code into an EC2 instance. All is fine until there&#x27;s a weird system dependency error that isn&#x27;t documented because the AMI being used has just been hand built over the last three years. Have fun tracking down that specific PHP system dependency when AL2 goes EOL. I don&#x27;t want to write code that doesn&#x27;t have _documented_ dependencies on system packages. Even just a Dockerfile serves as solid documentation on what we&#x27;re using. reply vilunov 18 hours agorootparentprevWell, glibc could be considered part of the operating system, although this too is arguably not correct, because some technologies go out of the way to not depend on anything present in the system and be completely self-contained, e.g. fully statically linked Go binary with no Cgo usage.Nevertheless, glibc is not the only system dependency which is often used by apps, another such example is JVM of a specific version, which is not tracked by any of the popular JVM build tools and package managers; and OpenSSL, which is too installed by the system package manager.Dockerfiles exists to fix this by defining all the necessary installation steps as a sequence of instructions, but this is far from a proper package manager. reply twic 12 hours agorootparentThe libc is absolutely part of the operating system. Some people and tools go out of their way to avoid using it, but they are completely mistaken to do so. Go in particular has wasted a huge amount of effort on this absolutely pointless exercise.And not just libc - on a typical unix, there are a small number of other libraries which constitute part of the operating system, like libm, libdl, and libpthread. They are part of the means by which the operating system delivers the POSIX environment.You&#x27;re right that the JVM is a dependency, and that there is very poor versioning support for it in production.

In the age of containers, this particular point has been a bit of a struggle for me. Docker secrets don&#x27;t always play well, and you need to do some gymnastics to make it work. reply jcrites 18 hours agoparentCould you elaborate? How are environment variables insecure? If the secret will be present in the application throughout it&#x27;s lifetime, then what&#x27;s a better alternative?Just because a secret is injected into the application as an environment variable does not mean it&#x27;s handled insecurely elsewhere. For example, AWS ECS containers have built-in support for fetching secrets from Secret Manager at startup and passing them as environment variables: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AmazonECS&#x2F;latest&#x2F;developerguide&#x2F;...This fetches the secret at the time the container starts up (IIRC), and uses the IAM credentials of the running application to fetch them from Secret Manager (so it must have permission to the secret).The merit of using environment variables seems to depend entirely on how they are, well, configured. With a mechanism like this I don&#x27;t see much disadvantage.

If you’re running your containers with a single process, you are doing the exact access control you just outlined. At that point what is the difference between a file on disk with read permissions for the proc owner vs only the proc having the ENV injected to its shell at runtime? I’d maybe even say the ENV at runtime is more secure than the chown’d file on disk because the ENV injected variant is ephemeral and when that container&#x2F;proc dies, so does the ENV sitting in its memory, whereas the other leaves a file on disk potentially depending on where it was written to, regardless of who can access it. Then there’s the fact that a lot more people than you think run containers as root so all file access control goes out the window.From a security perspective it is always more secure to have something only in memory of the running process than it is to have a file on disk regardless of file permissions reply dharmab 14 hours agorootparentContainers don&#x27;t enforce that isolation. Another process can nsenter the container&#x27;s PID namespace.

Global variables everywhere, widely distributed state, dependence on external systems and specific file system layouts and general disregard for modularity made it impossible to run anything outside of the context it was designed in. All of this was \"bad design\", but it met deadlines, so everybody did it anyway. I was _hoping_ that if unit testing gained some traction, programmers would get away from monolithic design.After 25 years of observing unit tests for getters and setters and then one big unit test that creates an in-memory database because every function in the app needs a live database just to run and then gets commented out because it fails, I&#x27;ve lost any faith that unit testing will ever be more than a meaningless checkmark that everybody fills out because it&#x27;s a \"best practice\" but nobody actually stops to think why. reply freedomben 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen similar as well.

Same for email-endpoints, CDN, a message-bus, etc.I&#x27;ve had my share of near-heart-attacks where I send out 10k emails or thousands of payments on actual production services because of a spagetti config loaders with stuff that boils down to `if (getHostname() === \"localhost\") { include(\"dev.json\") } else { include(\"prod.json\") }`.I&#x27;d prefer a hundred .envs and whatnots to avoid just one of these scares. reply jameshart 6 hours agorootparentMy approach is:- defaults are sensible (safe and secure) defaults for prod- prod secrets are only available in the prod environmentSo if you accidentally end up trying to run with the prod settings in a nonproduction environment it might try and access the prod database server... but it won&#x27;t get anywhere because it doesn&#x27;t have those secrets. reply schneems 18 hours agoparentprev> Configuration needs to have cascading levels to make life easiest in dev, test and production without enormous setup time.The backdrop of when the 12factor app was written is that you can toggle modes like that with RAILS_ENV=test (an environment variable).One way I think of the config section is “does your config strategy play well with containers?” Once you build an image you have a static disk state that doesn’t persist changes unless you make a new image. If your config is file based (only), then to toggle between test and production behavior you would have to build a whole new image.By allowing config to change without the underlying disk, it helps to isolate changes. Did the app break because something in the deploy (image generation) broke? Or is it a bad config? If you decouple image generation from configuration changes it eliminates that question. reply ahtihn 17 hours agorootparent> Once you build an image you have a static disk state that doesn’t persist changes unless you make a new image. If your config is file based (only), then to toggle between test and production behavior you would have to build a whole new image.You could mount a volume with the config file. The nice thing is that this lets you change the config at runtime (assuming the app watches for file changes). Env vars cannot be changed at runtime. reply schneems 8 hours agorootparent> Env vars cannot be changed at runtimeYou can specify env vars any time you boot up an image. I see this as a benefit. I use containers for production and don’t want wild ssh yolo modifications. I want to have very clear immutable inputs.> mount a volume with the config fileSure, but where? And what if you need multiple files for multiple different things to configure? What’s to prevent someone from accidentally putting non config files into that volume or accidentally changing the permissions on the file or any other host of things that we just don’t have to reinvent if we use env vars. reply CraigJPerry 18 hours agoparentprevSo long as you are systemically protecting against someone spinning up a QA instance against some Prod resource then it’s probably alright to ship most config with the app. You don’t want to allow a (entirely predictable) human error to cause 100k auth denied retries against a prod job submission queue from QA for example. Much config isn’t about infra though, it’s often what kind of ResolverStrategy (made up but plausible sounding name) bean do I want to wire in each env for example. reply Kinrany 18 hours agoparentprevYou can, and probably should, have reasonable defaults.Configuration should be version controlled, but separately from source code because it describes deployments, not images used for deployments. reply willseth 18 hours agoparentprevWhy not also express the defaults as config, or is that what you meant?

My experience at a company that went deep into expanding beyond&#x2F;removing some of the 12 Factors is that it breaks portability of containerized software built with those assumptions. There were a few times I needed to install a vendor product or open source project that was built to the 12 factors but spent a month or more just building a shim to make it conform to our particular bend on it. I’m sure there are good reasons to deviate but I wasn’t particularly impressed with our decisions and more importantly why we made them. reply nopurpose 17 hours agoprevI wish there was a generic control plane for generating and shipping config to apps. Kinda what Envoy proxy has, but capable of shipping arbitrary schema.Many complications of config management will go away then. Every app instances knows just its ID, then everything else (region, cluster, stage, current experiment, maintenance, anything else) is discovered by \"configd\" service and config suitable for that very instance is returned. Not unlike feature flags, but for backend services.OPA (Open Policy Agent) comes close: it has data sources (so it can fetch inventory from cloud providers, kubernetes, any other internal system) and Rego language to program config generation, but it doesn&#x27;t have means to notify instances of config updates, so they have to resort to polling. reply zoogeny 18 hours agoprevSeems good as a general heuristic but bad as a requirements checklist. reply ris58h 19 hours agoprevYou should add 2017 in the title. reply wesleytodd 19 hours agoparentyeah I got confused seeing this on the top. in my head said \"what is this, 2012?\".

Kubernetes files are generated by Jsonnet. It is invoked from makefiles. Makefiles are spread across different git modules. The scripts require various Go binaries. Most are installed through a command, some have to be installed manually. If the version is wrong, mysterious errors happen.I once had a problem with the generated files so I deleted the generated directory and regenerated everything. Turns out you can&#x27;t do that. The generated files are edited, and if you generate from scratch you&#x27;ve wiped out the manual edits.Note that I&#x27;m not criticizing Kubernetes here.

Don&#x27;t change APIs or functionality for \"refactoring\" reasons. Replacing something with Rust is no excuse for leaving it broken for a month.- Don&#x27;t duplicate functionality without differentiated purposes.- Make the purpose of a service and it&#x27;s use-cases crystal clear.- Name things sensibly rather than giving them cute names.- Standardize stateful storage into a common API that allows for interchangeable and migratable backends.- Document everything into a wiki that&#x27;s consistent, organized, and is maintained by dedicated, effective technical writers. Don&#x27;t brain spew text into massive documents!- Following the previous, have a comprehensive service catalog.- Don&#x27;t assume the reader knows what you know. Explain everything from primitives.- Aim for self-service.- Service owners and&#x2F;or their operations support must be professional and available enough to provide input when self-service, board messaging, and peer discussions are unable to provide an authoritative resolution.- Reuse, reuse, reuse, and reuse some more.- Build tools that can visualize, chart, and record query results from almost anywhere.- Don&#x27;t be Twitter: Build selective authorization into every internal API.- Least (but necessary) privilege: issue enough reason-tagged authority delegations such that people can do their jobs. Locking down every bit of internal telemetry and analytics preventing joins between datasources doesn&#x27;t scale OR create a situation where people are perennially in technical violation of the wording of official policy to do their jobs.- Reward the reduction and efficient maintenance of code because too often, only adding features is rewarded.- Don&#x27;t make the common cases difficult and awkward.- Avoid code generation.- Avoid unnecessary layers of abstraction.- Avoid building layer upon layer of CLI codegen or service commands lacking in documentation and missing man pages.- Hire some people with actual software engineering, software architecting, systems engineering, and systems operations experience.

    "originBody": "Pursuit Of Laziness A blog by Jesse Duffield Blog About Can't Be F*cked: Underrated Cause of Tech Debt Written on October 12, 2023 Can’t Be Fucked Aussie slang for not wanting to, or not having the energy and motivation to do something. “Man, i really can’t be fucked changing the channel, let’s just watch Springer.” - Urban Dictionary I used to think that if I could just learn a bunch of things about programming, that would make me a better programmer. Sure, the learning I’ve done so far has made me a better programmer, but the person I was striving to become was a little more… admirable. Whether it’s at work or in my open source travels, I routinely come across developers who are the real deal: they’re conscientious and judicious in an unwavering way. They set a standard for themselves and do not compromise on it. Whether that’s a deliberate thing or whether they’re just built that way, it’s humbling to witness. If there’s a flaky test, they investigate it and fix it. If there’s a bug they spot in the wild, they make a ticket, and maybe even fix it then-and-there. If a new feature doesn’t gel well with the existing code, they refactor the code first rather than hacking the feature in. They’ll dive as far down the stack as necessary to get to the bottom of something. None of these things are necessary but great developers know that if they don’t address a problem early, and properly, it will only cost them more time in the long run. ‘But,’, you say, ‘premature optimisation is the root of all evil! Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction! Don’t be an architecture astronaut!’ The developers I’m thinking about already know of all those takes and have internalised them long ago. They know that sometimes ‘good enough’ is the right choice given the constraints of a project. They know that sometimes you need to cut scope to stay on-track. They know that sometimes it’s better to wait to learn more about a domain before rearchitecting a system. And yet in spite of those constraints their output remains golden. These are hard working motherf*ckers whose diligence and perseverance put other devs to shame. Other devs… like me. Sometimes, I just CBF. I spent months (part time, of course) building out an end-to-end test system for my open source project Lazygit, and every day I think of all the regressions that system has prevented and how much harder it would be to add that system now given how many tests have been written since. I know for a fact it was worth the effort. So why haven’t I added end-to-end tests to my other project, Lazydocker? Because I CBF. I raised an issue in somebody else’s open source repo and they asked me to present them with a minimal repro git repo. Why haven’t I done that yet? Because I CBF. Why do I still have so much of my code living in a God Struct? If I could just finish that big refactor I started over a year ago, my codebase would be far easier to navigate and contribute to. The answer, dear reader, is that I CBF. Is it burnout? Maybe. Is it a lack of Growth Mindset? Hard to say. Is it just the reality of my personality? Who knows. As I continue my journey as a developer I learn more about myself, and one of the things I’ve learnt is that my motivation ebbs and flows. I’ll have a good run, inhabiting the persona of the developers I look up to, however imperfectly, until I once again find myself with the constraint that trumps all the extrinsic constraints of the project at hand: a deficiency of motivation. I’ve also learnt that knowledge only gets you so far. I’m still just scratching the surface of all the developer-y things there are to be learnt, but even for the topics I consider myself knowledgeable, knowing what’s right and doing what’s right are two very different things. Knowing the long-term pain of tech debt is certainly a motivator for avoiding it, but it’s no guarantee. And sometimes knowledge can be wielded impiously: ‘I’d add more tests but too many tests creates a maintenance burden’. ‘I could refactor this but I want to wait a little to see how other features affect things’. ‘Keep It Simple, Stupid’. ‘Premature optimisation’, ‘Cut scope aggressively’, etc. These maxims can be deployed for evil just as well as good. Have you ever hid behind one of these lines to hide the fact that in reality you just CBF? Maybe you don’t have the energy to write perfect code, but honesty requires less creativity than lying. It’s a breath of fresh air when a contributor admits some element of their pull request is lacking because they’re lazy. At least then you have the opportunity to judge for yourself whether their laziness exceeds your own standards or whether their time is indeed better spent working on the next thing. That’s a much easier game to play than bandying software engineering maxims. So, if you find that you CBF, don’t be dismayed; it happens to everyone (except those very special people we all aspire to). If in the moment you don’t have the strength to overcome it, at least be honest. And if you’ve been going 100% for too long, maybe it’s time to take that holiday. I’d like to end this post with an exploration about how laziness evolved for a reason and that despite us all wishing we had more motivation, there are benefits to being selective with our energy, but… I CBF ;) Discussion links Hacker News Other If you liked this post you may also like my recent short story about an insecure superintelligent robot escaping from an AI lab",

I fixed broken builds. I made our abandoned test suite green. I refactored our deployment pipeline. I hunted down the root cause of bugs and fixed them. But then I noticed several things.First, rather than encourage people to behave like me by example, they did the opposite. Why fix a broken build when I would come along and do it? it turns out doing shit work just gives you more shit work.Also the guy does hack jobs got promoted ahead of me because he is a master of optics and presents his work much better than it is.

Problem? Yes? A bit ugly? Yes. But in reality the problem is 100% of the time covered by boxes and anyway I can live a happy life in this house for decades and not be affected. That&#x27;s 0% tech debt.On the other hand if my gutters are clogged, there&#x27;s interest on that because the longer I wait the costlier it will be to deal with since clogged gutters can lead to basement leaks or gutters themselves detaching. Or, if my stoop is broken, that&#x27;s not just an eye sore but I keep tripping on it, the faster I fix it the sooner I stop tripping. That&#x27;s a high-interest debt that should be fixed asap.In engineering, a high-rate debt could be some architectural thing that slows down the development of every single feature. You want to quickly pause features to pay this down so everything can move faster. On the other hand, some file that you never touch having some shitty code or lots of TODOs may be a very low interest debt since in practice you never touch it or are otherwise not bothered by it other than knowing that it&#x27;s ugly - like my closet floor.Engineers make two mistakes around this - fixing zero-interest debt when there&#x27;s more important things to do on one hand. On the other hand, when they say \"oh, product management&#x2F;leadership didn&#x27;t sponsor our tech debt fixing\" - it&#x27;s often because we fail to articulate the real cost of that problem - explaining that it&#x27;s high rate and how it&#x27;s costing you. reply autokad 12 hours agoparent> oh, product management&#x2F;leadership didn&#x27;t sponsor our tech debt fixing\" - it&#x27;s often because we fail to articulate the real cost of that problemI disagree. they simply don&#x27;t care because from the top down, new shiny stuff gets attention, not keeping the old stuff going.edit: I also wanted to add this, if I do convince them of its importance, MAKE NO MISTAKE, management will agree that work must be done but it has absolutely NO BEARING on having a positive job performance.

While persuading someone it&#x27;s momentarily important to shift from what was going to be done to what you think should be done can be one way to acquire \"career capital\" (Newport) and maybe move towards it being your job to do so, it doesn&#x27;t change what your current job is which is basically to consistently show up and do whatever those others decide is important, and to be ok with that; slow, mediocre, gradual progress and existence, which is perfectly fine if you have other part s of your life, which you should be spending more time on anyway. If new shiny stuff gets attention, then that&#x27;s part of the dysfunction of the overall system (Meadows - Thinking in Systems)When I was early in my stupid career as an developer, I made the idiotic mistake of trying to influence decisions regarding things that didn&#x27;t matter to anyone else, like accessibility, usability, and when I failed to do so put in a lot of my own personal energy to do it right anyway.

On the other hand, if you do have a velocity issue because of bad hygiene, then that sounds in line with your c-suite concern.\"hey boss, our code needs to be more hygienic\" - nobody cares.\"hey boss, we are at 10% of possible velocity because of issues X,Y,Z, and we can be 10X faster if we take a month to fix those\" - now they are listening. reply koonsolo 3 hours agorootparentHey, I fully agree with your original post and this one, but I wanted to present to you a crazy example I experienced years ago.So we offered a solution to our customers, and then we could customize this by offering our own \"consultant\" developers. In the end, each developer had a goal to be \"80% of their time billable\".Now we sometimes had to write these things called \"channels\", which took about 2 weeks to write. If we would have rewritten the framework behind it (which would take about 2 weeks) we could have probably sped up writing channels to less than a week! The thing was, nobody really cared if it took 2 weeks or less than a week, since the customer paid for it. My statement of &#x27;let the customer pay for the 2 weeks anyway&#x27; never got hold (that would have probably resulted in some accountant fraud I guess, the way they set up the contract). So anyway, nobody was willing to invest this 2 weeks refactoring that would almost instantly pay itself back.We were writing channels all the time, and it always felt like such a waste.Sometimes in corporations, you can end up in the most crazy situations.

Were you able to get that much out of this?And then to make the analogy work for you again - my closet IS a form of tech debt and I insist that it&#x27;s \"0% debt\". For example, if I am going to sell the house, it might be the case that having this flawed floor would cause me to get lower offers.

The debt is objective but we live in a world where finding that objective measure is infeasible.to use your cheese metaphor, it&#x27;s more like boldly claiming the earth is 35% iron. it&#x27;s something you can quickly google and is acceptable through decades of study, but it also wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if better tooling and measurements later on specify \"it&#x27;s actually 33.42% iron\".

So then if you take out a loan to fix it it&#x27;s also debt?What the poster meant is it doesn&#x27;t always harm anything to leave something unfinished or imperfect.

Every morcel of time spent doing things nobody can see is time not spent doing other things with more visibility.

Sure, that cheap plywood isn&#x27;t normally visible, but a customer who looks will find it. very few iphone consumers have the skills to find bad code and fewer care as long as it does what it is intended.

A good mass market product should have a plywood back, because pushing up the cost takes away from it&#x27;s utility.Generally speaking, modern management doesn&#x27;t respect the business, they look at maximizing current P&L before all else. I worked at a place where the entire business was dependent on a true legacy system where 75% of the staff responsible for this core system retired years ago, and the rest literally died at their desks. They considered it their life&#x27;s work and documented everything and advocated for a variety of sane plans to migrate.What was the result? They&#x27;re all dead. The last one was 74. The system remains, and they are paying the legacy vendor 50x and getting minimum viable support and zero enhancement, further increasing complexity. It&#x27;s a shitshow for the company, but they still haven&#x27;t moved to fix it. The lesson is, don&#x27;t get emotionally invested in the company.

High quality products built by artisans mean you aren’t participating(as much) in globalist, race-to-the-bottom corporate behavior.

Maybe that chest of drawers falls apart after 5 years instead of 20, but that&#x27;s not going to sway a person who just gets by financially.If you hate globalisation, then maybe that can be tackled with better legislation, improvements in working conditions and standards of living, and other systematic changes.

Now, of course, this would differ from workplace to workplace, so YMMV, but at my workplace, so many developers have the craftsmanship attitude. They&#x27;d love to solve hard problems and solve them well, not because the solutions are worth money in a marketplace, but because they are intrinsically valuable, interesting, meaningful, delightful, etc. to the developers.The problem is the business doesn&#x27;t care about anything except how much money can be gotten out it, often with a short-term horizon.So the developers and the business people walk shoulder to shoulder for a little ways, where the two interests are aligned, but then we part ways at the point of introducing technical debt. As a developer, I&#x27;m not free to take the time I need to pay down this debt, because of business constraints. reply ryandrake 16 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ll notice I never blamed developers in particular.

A lot of times, the fancy back of the chest is a complete and utter waste of time and effort.Good engineers have to know when they&#x27;re building a beautiful chest for public display for 20 years, and when their customer doesn&#x27;t even know if they want a chest yet.

But it’s also not fun and defeats the purpose of the contest. _The constraints were important._ It’s the constraints that make it engineering. So you could use a beautiful piece of solid wood on the back of your dresser. But most likely that breaks the constraint of cost.

The worst cases tend to be \"fully agile\" shops that don&#x27;t account for refactoring &#x2F; code quality cleanups at all.Apple is the unicorn in that regard (or at least it was up until the last years, their software quality definitely declined...): their products cost a ton of money for the customers, so the customers expect good quality, Apple as a company has the profit margin to actually make that happen, and most importantly: at the helm they had Steve Jobs who actually \"had an eye\" for experience instead of some run-off-the-mill MBA beancounter.(Do note that there is also the other extreme: just look at Juicero.

Just put together a refactoring design plan and present it at the next design meeting. Then after multiple rounds of reviews and feedback, we’ll divide the refactoring plan into a series of milestones that can be tracked and estimated. Then we can prioritize it during our next planning cycle among the other features that we want to accomplish.”If you do try the whole “never ask permission to refactor,” you’re admonished for creating a PR that doesn’t adhere to the patterns in the repository. “I like this, but we need to discuss this with the whole team.”So the tech debt spirals away until it takes months for anyone to merge a PR and tests are so flakey it feels more like playing casino slots hitting the restart button until it builds.

Motivation, effort, energy, willpower, whatever you want to call it: it&#x27;s finite.The draw of an organization is that it gets more done than individual programmers. The catch is that in gluing things together, there are cracks, and things fall through them. It&#x27;s the responsibility of the COO, HR, product managers, etc. -- anyone getting their salary from the organizational stuff and not the technical stuff -- to make sure there are processes in place to address those cracks. To make sure someone has to \"BF.\"Increasingly, at every place I&#x27;ve worked, they just offload those to individual engineers and designers. because they&#x27;re hard to measure with respect to the bottom line or OKRs. The company suffers and engineers burn out because you can only \"BF\" on extra little tickets and tasks that fell through the cracks for so long without getting paid more. reply crvdgc 2 hours agoprevMaybe slightly missing the main point here, but I find documenting your compromise is a good trade-off (TODO: BF later). Make a note in the comment or PR, create a ticket for it, but leave it for another day.It takes little effort. Writing things down helps you reassess your choice. And it serves a good starting point for future revisiting. It also keeps you honest (certain culture promotes a pretence of perfection).

When you just can&#x27;t be f*****, it means that some circuit in your brain just doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthwhile to do the refactoring or tests or whatever it is.That circuit could be right in that the payoff is often not actually worth the effort, when viewed objectively and holistically. For example, if you literally spend two months working on end-to-end tests and it in fact does save you three whole weeks of work in terms of debugging or whatever over the course of the next six months, that doesn&#x27;t add up.I think there are some common extremes. On one hand, the business side often forces engineers to take on tech debt that really is the wrong tradeoff. On the other hand, many engineers may spend time creating a sort of idealized factorization and large test suite that in the end really isn&#x27;t going to pay off. And part of that is actually just because they are worried someone else will find a nicer code organization or another test to write and judge them for not doing it. reply DanielHB 2 hours agoparentnot everything is just ROI.

The kind of bugs where you can invest days and have nothing really to show for it except crossing out some suspicions. Or maybe incorrectly crossing one out and then going on a wild goose chase until you circle back to it in a week, flustered.You&#x27;re expected to commit all of your mental energy to these tickets day after day, and then once you finally triumph and solve the bug after coffee or amphetamine binges, you turn in the code, close the ticket, and you&#x27;re expected to immediately work on the next ticket.You don&#x27;t get a real break. But you can mentally rest at the start of the next ticket since nobody expects instant results. But now it&#x27;s been a couple days and people are asking you what you&#x27;ve been doing so far—you must be blocked, right?—but you&#x27;ve barely started and you&#x27;re pressured to invent small lies and excuses about why you&#x27;re behind, each one risking yet another slip of the mask.And when you need some time off the most, it&#x27;s when you&#x27;re the most behind of all and people have begun to notice, so taking the time off doesn&#x27;t even seem like an option. reply Terr_ 17 hours agorootparent> The kind of bugs where you can invest days and have nothing really to show for it except crossing out some suspicions.Me, with zero C&#x2F;C++ experience, being asked to figure out why the newer version of the Linux kernel is randomly crash-panicking after getting cross-compiled for a custom hardware box.(\"He&#x27;s familiar with the the build-system scripts, so he can see what changed.\")-----I spent weeks of testing slightly different code-versions, different compile settings, different kconfig options, knocking out particular drivers, waiting for recompiles and walking back and forth to reboot the machine, and generally puzzling over extremely obscure and shifting error traces...

Often-well-meaning people will put the cart before the horse, but no amount of quacking will turn you into a duck, etc.On balance, it’s healthy to be skeptical of people demanding devotion to some process or objective that’s not rooted in first principles you can agree with.It wouldn’t surprise me too much if a meaningful proportion of the 3.6m applications per year are filed by people who find the first principles behind Tesla’s culture worthy of their devotion.But yeah, the number of companies or projects that would benefit from that style of approach is quite small. 20% is the ceiling, 10% feels closer to the truth. replyswatcoder 17 hours agorootparentprevWho left bugs like that on the board until so late in development?

You see it when an engineering team isn&#x27;t agreeing to take on work, but rather being told what to work on by people outside of the team. Sometimes it&#x27;s isolated to a single team, but sometimes it can be a whole org or company. It&#x27;s caused by bad expectations around the amount of work that can be done and unclear priorities. How many people it affects depends on what level the bad expectations are being set at.In practice, this is how I&#x27;ve seen it play out. There are 10 developers worth of work that needs to be done by X date, but we only have a team of 8. No one has made it clear what the prioritization is or if they have, that priority isn&#x27;t universally accepted or changes day to day. If everything is equally important, the tough work that may not have noticeable results is often what gets pushed into the backlog over and over. To people who see engineers as the \"build new features\" people, it&#x27;s hard to regularly justify \"I can&#x27;t build feature X because I have to solve bug Y\" and then a week later say \"I still have no idea what&#x27;s causing this issue\".It&#x27;s easy to say, well just get everyone to agree on priority and what a reasonable amount of work is, but that&#x27;s far, far easier said than done. reply __loam 12 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s often how tech debt happens.

GONZALEZ OCT 12, 2023 26 9 Share Source: Ideogram. “OpenAI on a throne surrounded by piles of money.” Since the beginning of the internet, data flywheels have created giant companies — first Google, quickly followed by social media companies, and now, OpenAI and other LLM providers. OpenAI alone likely has more usage than all the other model providers combined, with Google and Anthropic making up most of the rest. These companies are collecting enormous amounts of data — not only can they see user prompts, they also get explicit feedback (thumbs up/thumbs down) as well as implicit feedback (e.g., asking more questions if you didn’t get the answer you wanted). Better yet, they are also at the forefront of customer conversations, understanding where LLM users are pushing the boundaries and where the models fail. All of this is grist for the mill of future model training, and investment is only accelerating: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently predicted that we’ll have models that cost $10B in 2 years. Subscribe Model quality is definitely a big advantage, but it’s only a part of the story. The more impressive moat these companies have is the scalability of their infrastructure and the quality of their service. Let’s look at fine-tuning APIs as an illustrative example. Our team at RunLLM has been running experiments recently with the GPT fine-tuning API. A single fine-tuning run on GPT-3.5 costs us anywhere from $4-12 dollars and take about 1-1.5 hours to fine-tune over about 1 million tokens. Meanwhile, a single p4d.24xlarge on AWS costs $32.77 per-hour on-demand or $19.22 per-hour if you reserve for 1 year. Each machine comes with 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs. Assuming that OpenAI only uses 8 GPUs to fine-tune GPT-3.5, it’s 3-8x cheaper to use OpenAI than it is to rent a p4d.24xlarge from Amazon — without even accounting for the technical expertise required to deploy and run the jobs. AWS is obviously charging a markup on its EC2 instances, but OpenAI’s costs include training and storing the model weights (likely reasonably cheap with LoRA), building & maintaining the fine-tuning infrastructure, and the expertise needed to rack & stack thousands of GPUs internally1. If we had a dense enough workload, perhaps we could justify renting a p4d.24xlarge at the yearly reserved cost. At $19.22 per-hour, we’ll be paying about $166K per-year. Let’s assume again we’re using LoRA to fine-tune a model on 8 A100s, perhaps at 2 hours per run. We can do 12 fine-tuning runs per-day. on these GPUs, or 4,380 fine-tuning runs per year. We’ll allocate one engineer to deploy, check, and validate fine-tuning runs full-time (we don’t envy them!), which will cost us perhaps $200K per-year. (Let’s also assume that we have plenty of data readily available to us to keep fine-tuning jobs going constantly.) At $366K ($166K AWS + $200K talent), we’re paying around $80 per-fine-tuning run, about 8-20x higher than what we’re paying OpenAI! This just to fine-tune a model. While per-token inference costs for fine-tuned GPT-3.5 is 10x more expensive than GPT-3.5 it is still 10x cheaper than GPT-4! Serving a model on your own hardware is significantly more expensive unless you can reach a large enough scale to fully utilize serving hardware or elastically scale (impossible when GPU availability is limited). We’ll give the back of the envelope math a rest, but it proves a critical point: The major LLM providers’ advantage doesn’t just lie in the quality of the model but in their ability to serve models at extreme economies of scale. It simply doesn’t make sense for most organizations to run after their own open-source LLM deployments. They’ll be sinking needless time, talent, and money into an unsolvable optimization problem, while competitors will move faster and likely achieve better quality by layering on top of OpenAI. Of course, that doesn’t mean that open-source models have no future. We touched on this last week, and our friend Nathan Lambert at Interconnects recently wrote about the future of open-source models as well. Open-source models must get smaller over time to reduce the cost, complexity, and time required to customize and run them. For everything else, the major LLM providers will dominate. 1 You might be wondering if OpenAI is eating the cost of fine-tuning and serving in order to build market share, similar to what Uber and Lyft famously did in the rideshare market for many years. The ridesharing companies were famously never able to stomp out competition in the way many predicted, but the switching cost with software infrastructure is significantly higher than the switching cost between two apps on your phone. Even if prices eventually go up, these companies will dominate the market, and they still have huge gaps to fill until they reach the cost of hand-rolled models. It’s also worth noting that we’re comparing off-the-shelf AWS GPU prices to OpenAI’s, likely-highly-subsidized GPU pricing on Azure — but the scale of OpenAI’s usage only cements their advantage here.

OpenAI wants you to abandon doing it yourself by subsidizing infrastructure (for now). That will end. Not to say that AWS is the cheapest way to do this - but when the industry is committed to losing billions of dollars to stake out turf, this is what you'll see. You definitely can't extrapolate this over time. Because OpenAI's cost of running the actual infrastructure isn't going to be that much different than AWS'.

OpenAI is cheap because of has to be right now. They need to establish market dominance quickly, before competitors slide in. The winner of this horse race is not going to be the company with the best performing AI, it’s going to be the one who does the best job at creating an outstanding UX, ubiquitously presence, entrenching users, and building competitive moats that are not feature differentiated because at best even cutting edge features are only 6-12 months ahead of competition cloning or beating.This is Uber&#x2F;AirBnB&#x2F;Wework&#x2F;literally every VC subsidized hungry-hungry-hippos market grab all over again. If you’re falling in love because the prices are so low, that is ephemeral at best and is not a moat. Someone try calling an Uber in SF today and tell me how much that costs you and how much worse the experience is vs 2017.OpenAI is the undisputed future of AI… for timescales 6 months and less. They are still extremely vulnerable to complete disruption and as likely to be the next MySpace as they are Facebook. reply adam_arthur 13 hours agoparentThe winner is going to be the consumers of AI.It&#x27;s a race to the bottom on pricing on the provider&#x2F;infra side. It seems very unlikely that any single LLM provider will achieve a sustained and durable advantage enough to achieve large margins on their product.Consumers can swap between providers with relative ease, and there is very little stickiness to these LLM APIs, since the interfaces are general and operate on natural language. Versus something like building out a Salesforce integration and then trying to update that to a competitor. Or migrating from Mongo to DynamoDB.Building the LLMs is where the cool tech lives, but surprised so many are seeing that as a compelling investment opportunity.But, let&#x27;s see! reply agentcoops 10 hours agorootparentCertainly the undisputed winners will be the very few firms with enough engineering resources and GPUs to train their own models (not just fine-tune) where the models in question increase the productivity of workers in their non-ai-related profit centers. After that we have the real question of what the future will be of open source LLMs, on the one hand, and the question most relevant to this article of what sort and whether profitable “AI businesses” can be sustained over time. As Stratechery has analyzed, it is very possible that OpenAI turns out to be a very profitable B2C company with ad revenue in ChatGPT not concerned with their B2B sales or even the objective quality of their AI. Right now is an incredible time for AI: cheap Uber rides never qualitatively changed my life, but the current consumer access to AI models is truly incredible and I hope that only improves. However, even ignoring whatever happens on the regulatory front, I don’t think that is guaranteed at all. reply herval 10 hours agorootparentThis was definitely a theory that made people burn tons of money on the past couple of years, but I don’t think it holds water. These models are getting obsolete so fast, and there’s so many open ones, I doubt any one’s privately trained model can stay relevant for long reply flir 9 hours agorootparentThe data is the moat.(If you can train your internally deployed LLM on data none of your competitors have, that&#x27;s an advantage). reply visarga 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not anymore. If the model is publicly accessible, its skills can be distilled by performing some API calls and recording input-output pairs. This scheme works so well it has become the main mode to prepare data for small models. Model skills leak. reply flir 3 minutes agorootparentI agree, publicly deployed models seem to be easy to train from. I did say \"internally deployed LLM\" though. agentcoops said \"...where the models in question increase the productivity of workers in their non-ai-related profit centers\" above, that&#x27;s the bit I was aiming at. shon 8 hours agorootparentprevIn that case, X.AI, powered by X&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Tesla data and possibly Facebook (both closed, and somewhat hard to crawl inside) have the largest moat. reply edmundsauto 7 hours agorootparentI don’t think they necessarily will be allowed to train on their data unless they get explicit permission. They will try, but the way I see privacy revaluations is that users will have to authorize specific uses of their data and not be surprised by any application.This could be one of the more interesting privacy fights of the next decade.I’m sure there are easy cynical takes about how they will just shrink wrap the EULA, and maybe they will. But in a good privacy environment, users should never be surprised and have control over how their data is used. And I think we’ve made some progress there. reply thegasman 6 hours agorootparentprevChina probably has the most comprehensive data on its users from a surveillance perspective reply lmm 8 hours agorootparentprevYou may not need to train a model to make use of your data though. Maybe a cheap fine tune would work just as well. Maybe just having the data well indexed and&#x2F;or part of the prompt context is good enough. reply frozenport 7 hours agorootparentprevIdk. These were trained on pretty public things like Wikipedia. reply user3939382 12 hours agorootparentprev> The winner is going to be the consumersCloud infra may be a comparable market, since computation is a big share of AI costs. Did consumers win big from competition between AWS, Azure, and GCP? Not sure. I see an uptick in write ups saying “We switched off cloud and reduced costs by 2&#x2F;3rds.” Not a scientific sample but may leave the question open. reply eek2121 11 hours agorootparentCan confirm: The cloud computing fad is well underway to dying...that is why AI is booming. One need only to follow the wall street dollars to figure that one out.Several very big profile names have recently begun moving back to self-hosted, hybrid, or dedicated hosting solutions.Cloud computing never was good in terms of value, however, it was only good in terms of scalability. AI solutions built on top of &#x27;the cloud&#x27; will always be even worse.Note that I pay a certain \"third tier\" cloud provider less than $100&#x2F;mo total for hosting large websites that would cost me more than 10 grand a month on AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;Google...while having better uptime. (the biggest differences? the complete lack of IO and bandwidth charges, and much lower storage charges)That should tell you all you need about these types of bubbles, but then again, most of us that watched the entire tech field unfold since the pre-internet phase already knew this. reply olivermuty 3 hours agorootparentJust gonna chip in here and say that anything costing a 100 bucks is not valid as an argument in a conversation about cloud.The prime selling point for cloud for large enterprises was (and still is):- a signatory that shares blame on several core security issues (iso stuff) - high amount of flexibility for individual teams used to asking for a vm then waiting four weeks for the itops dept to bring it onlineNow the vast majority of cloud moves for large enterprises ends up as a shitshow due to poor implementation sure, but the key points for getting it sold are still there.And ofc you CAN still cost optimize with cloud, its just harder.Context: Worked in post and pre sales over some years in MSFT in the enterprise segment.I got out before the downturn and everyone talking about cost, but my approach in selling azure to the c-suite would be fairly similar today I reckon. reply borg16 10 hours agorootparentprev> Several very big profile names have recently begun moving back to self-hosted, hybrid, or dedicated hosting solutions.Could you provide some examples? reply garciasn 10 hours agorootparentDropbox has been the biggest name who did the whole “cloud repatriation” thing, which was all the rage at the beginning of 2023, with claims that the cloud was soon to be dead—but cloud revenues are supposedly expected to be in excess of $1T by 2026, so whatever.Some random survey from ESG found 60% of respondents repatriated at least some workloads. Who knows what the N was though.Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdxcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;thinking-about-cloud-rep...Frankly, it makes sense that companies are deciding what works best and where. But the death knell of cloud providers is simply not happening. reply SupremumLimit 9 hours agorootparentprevWhich cloud provider is it, if you don’t mind sharing? reply adam_arthur 11 hours agorootparentprevMuch harder to switch cloud providers than to switch LLM models. How much time would it take most companies to move their product from AWS to GCP, for example? What if you use a cloud specific tool like DynamoDB?Margin is a function of stickiness&#x2F;cost of switching (among other things).I suspect eventually we will enter a world where migrating cloud providers is mostly a click of a button, but we&#x27;re a long ways off from that. Requires vendor agnostic and portable apis&#x2F;containers&#x2F;WASM runtimes everywhere.Swapping an LLM, at least in the current state, is about as close to updating a pointer as you can get. reply intended 5 hours agorootparentIf you swap an LLM, at the very least, you have to run your entire Eval set again.This will almost certainly lead to a prompt rebuild, to better accommodate new model idiosyncrasies.If you are unlucky- your use case may be one where Evals require human review.Unless you are YOLOing it without evals. In that case this is relevant. reply empiko 3 hours agorootparentYou need to rerun eval after each LLM update. GPTs have a new version every couple of months and their capabilities can change quite drastically pretty much randomly. Maybe they will make it more robust in time, but I think this is the feature of the technology and people will have to adapt to these quirks reply throwaway50182 11 hours agorootparentprevWell I&#x27;d have to change my Terraform provider and the managed Kubernetes resource... Other than that, it&#x27;d be the same. So half an hour of coding + half an hour of reconfiguring CI secrets? reply adam_arthur 11 hours agorootparentPretty obvious to most that switching cloud providers is not quick or painless for the majority of orgs. There&#x27;s not really an argument in good faith to suggest otherwise.Especially given that many orgs use managed or cloud specific solutions that have no 1:1 mapping between vendors reply throwaway50182 11 hours agorootparentI said I&#x27;d have to change that one managed resource. Actually it&#x27;s two - the managed database. But no more. reply atmosx 8 hours agorootparent> I said I&#x27;d have to change that one managed resource.

It&#x27;s still pretty small, but it&#x27;s something.You need to plan ahead, sure. Portability was one of my main concerns (including the possibility to go self-hosted). But it&#x27;s definitely not impossible, nor too hard to do. reply motoxpro 7 hours agorootparentprevDidn&#x27;t you know? It&#x27;s only one DB ENV variable and you&#x27;re swapped over from GCP to AWS. &#x2F;s reply altdataseller 11 hours agorootparentprevYou lost me at Terraform and Kubernetes.. reply throwaway50182 10 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s a serious cloud provider-portable replacement for Terraform?And Kubernetes? It goes way beyond containers, you can replace many cloud provider-specific resources with Kubernetes resources. What alternative gives you that? reply vikramkr 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are a HUGE number of startups that would have had a massively harder time if they had to roll their own infra. Who cares if the companies eventually have to move off? (Though even Netflix seems ok with it overall for now). There are a ton of services that just wouldn&#x27;t exist otherwise reply otabdeveloper4 1 hour agorootparentRenting a server and using standard commodity open source software and standard (outsourced) sysadmins is way cheaper and faster than learning and dealing with all the proprietary AWS and Azure junk.(Probably also less reliable than \"cloud\", but who cares if you&#x27;re a startup.) reply jokethrowaway 11 hours agorootparentprevI disagree, at early startup scale you don&#x27;t need much, you just buy a better VPS when you need to scale upLearning aws vs learning how to operate a vps are of comparable complexityIt took me less then a day to setup infra for my startup (more than 10 years ago) reply vikramkr 10 hours agorootparentSorry not sure if I&#x27;m missing something obvious but isn&#x27;t a VPS gonna be hosted by a cloud provider? How would that be an alternative to using the cloud? reply throwaway50182 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re just running VPS on the big clouds, you&#x27;re not going to get much advantage out of it, indeed.But tell me what third tier cheap provider has managed scale-to-zero-or-infinity functions? Managed storage with S3-like API? Where can I get an API gateway cheaper than Amazon? What about managed databases? These tools allow me to develop insanely scalable software incredibly easily.Agreed - all the big clouds are very expensive VPS hostings. Don&#x27;t use it for that. reply jddj 1 hour agorootparent> Managed storage with S3-like API?What&#x27;s third tier here? Pretty much all of them offer S3 compatibility it&#x27;s basically table stakes reply pleoxy 10 hours agorootparentprevYou get portability. Which the functions do not provide. Open source solutions have a longer career utility than proprietary offerings. I remember when NetWare certs were all the rage. Useless now. I remember msce. But if you learned open tools 35 years ago instead... You get the picture.You can scale from 1 thread 512MB RAM, to 500 threads and 12TB of RAM (off the shelf). Which is good enough for almost everyone who isn&#x27;t planet scale.Auto scaling also comes with auto billing. Oops, your accidental infinite loop spawning functions has bankrupted your company. You don&#x27;t have that risk starting with a VPS. reply throwaway50182 3 hours agorootparentI agree completely, but the argument remains the same - there&#x27;s not much utility in using the big clouds as VPS providers, and it&#x27;s definitely costly to do so. reply pleoxy 10 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not that hard. Particularly for simple deployments, which a startup should have or they are doing it wrong. reply vikramkr 10 hours agorootparentHow would you do it for a simple webapp? Genuine question reply pleoxy 6 hours agorootparentIngress that handles SSL. nginx, or caddy. Then stand up your app server behind that on the same VM. Database can be on the same or different VM.I try to not use anything else if I can avoid it on a new project.Ingress gives you the ability to load balance and is threaded and will scale with network transfer and cpu. Database should scale with a bump in VM specs as well, CPU and disk IOPS.If you keep your app server stateless you can simply multiply it for the number of copies you need for your load.Systemd can keep your app server running, it you docker it up and use that reply devbent 3 hours agorootparent> If you keep your app server stateless you can simply multiply it for the number of copies you need for your load.This right here so many times over.I&#x27;m not going to spend time worrying about scaling, I&#x27;m going spend time figuring out how to make stuff stateless. replychii 5 hours agorootparentprevBut you also have to account for the counterfactuals.If the cloud had not existed, those that claim they saved money switching away from cloud might never have been in business in the first place. reply peteradio 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not the tech it&#x27;s the data. As far as I know the data is not freely shared or at the very least there will be custom built models from data you can&#x27;t get anywhere else. reply 0x008 4 hours agorootparentprevBecause the cost of entry to the market is so absurdly high right now, it is seen as a good investment opportunity. If you throw enough money at it you can make your place no nice and early and then win later by sheer experience in the field. That is the idea. reply tomrod 12 hours agorootparentprevAye, open models from Meta are tearing at the moat. reply msikora 12 hours agorootparentprevYep. I wonder why there is not more features that would differentiate your LLM API, like for example the Functions in OpenAI LLM APIs. While not perfect it is extremely useful and not aware of a similar offering (I do know that there are Python packages offering similar functionality but it is my understanding that they don&#x27;t work as well as the OpenAI Functions). reply ChatGTP 8 hours agorootparentprevIt seems to be compelling because a genie has been the promise of technological progress forever and let&#x27;s be honest, it&#x27;s been marketed as such. Why would people not invest in that unless you were a technological savvy skeptic like yourself. reply NikolaNovak 5 hours agoparentprevPossibly unrealistic, but my fear is that they will end up like Netflix more than uber.Some will scream in horror but I wanted Netflix to be a monopoly. A single place and app and account with all the content I need.\"competition\" in streaming space has been nothing but disastrous for me as a consumer. It led to greedy heterogeneous islands of content, with proliferation of crappy apps and pointless restrictions and return to cable package mentality.Again, Possibly irrationally and ignorantly, my fear is that 5 years from now I&#x27;ll need a dozen subscriptions to less good services which will hoard their source data and models and be specialized based on which content they got licenses to. I. E.

The resulting giant would be too powerful and too influential. reply 0x008 4 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think you can really compare that. The streaming service market is not elastic because you cannot easily interchange one series for another.If other vendors LLMs become good enough it will actually be easily to interchange and then the race for the best UX and integration will be upon us (which the other commenter alluded to). reply toddmorey 13 hours agoparentprevJust heard Steve today from Builder.io who did an impressive launch of Figma -> code powered by AI.They trained a custom model for this. Better accuracy, sure, but I was a little surprised to watch how much faster it is than GPT4.Based on their testing, they’ve become believers in domain specific smaller models, especially for performance. reply phillipcarter 12 hours agorootparentCodegen is an area that seems to have the best breakout performance compared to the big FMs. In hindsight it should be obvious given that openai created Codex.However, I am skeptical that smaller and more focused models will do well for more general tasks. I’ve found gpt-4 to just be flatly excellent for tasks that involve emitting a custom DSL and customer-provided business context (the latter being something we cannot train for, not without immense expense). reply outlace 12 hours agoparentprevBut OpenAI appears to have some sort of data moat. I doubt their model is the best in the world, but more&#x2F;better data generally beats better model, and GPT-4 definitely beats Claude, Bard, Bernie and the rest probably because they curated the best quality and largest data set. Maybe that moat doesn&#x27;t last long but perhaps they have exclusive rights to some of that dataset through commercial agreements that could be a more durable moat. reply sangnoir 12 hours agorootparent> But OpenAI appears to have some sort of data moat.I&#x27;m willing to bet dollars to doughnuts that Google and Facebook have at least one, possibly 2 or more orders of magnitude more latent training data to work with - not including Googles search index.My uninformed opinion is that Google and Meta&#x27;s ML efforts are fragmented - with lots of serious effort going into increasing existing revenue streams with LLMs and the like being treated as a hobby or R&D projects. OpenAI is putting all its effort into a handful of projects that go into a product they sell. The dynamic and headcounts will change if the LLM market grows into billions reply CSMastermind 11 hours agorootparent> My uninformed opinion is that Google and Meta&#x27;s ML efforts are fragmented -It seems more likely that at Google at least they just fell into the classic innovator&#x27;s dilemma in which they were stuck trying to apply innovation to their current business models in an attempt at incremental innovation instead of seeking an entirely different customer and market. reply Turing_Machine 11 hours agorootparentYeah, same with Meta.Both have a large graveyard of failed innovation attempts.

They are just interested in doing “enough” so that people keep using their platforms. The race is about how often a day every person on the planet spends on either google or Facebook&#x2F;instagram.

So I checked. I initially signed up with Lyft sometime in late 2015. The first airport ride I got from my house in Austin was in December of that year and they billed me $38 base fare and $1.50 airport surcharge. This was before tipping was available in the app as well.I just took Lyft again to the airport earlier this month same location and I was billed $49 USD, and a $1.30 “Texas Surcharge”.An inflation calculator says that $38 usd in 2015 is equivalent to $49 in 2023. Color me surprised. I thought the prices had significantly increased since I signed up but it looks like actually no they didn’t.Trawling back through those old emails I do see constant “50% off all weekday rides” offers from the time I signed up until about March 2016, at which point they stopped. So there were some subsidized incentives when they were early in Austin but it looks like they stopped sometime in early 2016.

This paper reflects my own experiencehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.08377and shows how LLM technology has a lot more to offer than \"ChatGPT\". The real takeaway is that by training LLMs with real training data (even with a \"less powerful\" model) you can get an error rate more than 10x less than you get with the \"zero shot\" model of asking ChatGPT to answer a question for you the same way that Mickey Mouse asked the broom to clean up for him in Fantasia. The \"few-shot\" approach of supplying a few examples in the attention window was a little better but not much.The problem isn&#x27;t something that will go away with a more powerful model because the problem has a lot to do with the intrinsic fuzziness of language.People who are waiting for an exponentially more expensive ChatGPT-5 to save them will be pushing a bubble around under a rug endlessly while the grinds who formulate well-defined problems and make training sets will actually cross the finish line.Remember that Moore&#x27;s Law is over in the sense that transistors are not getting cheaper generation after generation, that is why the NVIDIA 40xx series is such a disappointment to most people. LLMs have some possibility of getting cheaper from a software perspective as we understand how they work and hardware can be better optimized to make the most of those transistors, but the driving force of the semiconductor revolution is spent unless people find some entirely different way to build chips.But... people really want to be like Mickey in Fantasia and hope the grinds are going to make magic for them. reply visarga 2 hours agorootparentFresh approaches to AI hardware are emerging, like the Groq Chip which utilizes software-defined memory and networking without caches. To simplify reasoning about the chip, Groq makes it synchronous so the compiler can orchestrate data flows between memory and compute and design network flows between chips. Every run becomes deterministic, removing the need for benchmarking models since execution time can be precisely calculated during compilation. With these innovations, Groq achieved state-of-the-art speed of 240 tokens&#x2F;s on 70B LLaMA.Fascinating stuff - a synchronous distributed system allows treating 1000 chips as one, knowing exactly when data will arrive cycle-for-cycle and which network paths are open. The compiler can balance loads. No more indeterminism or complexity in optimizing performance (high compute utilization). A few basic operations suffice, with the compiler handling optimization, instead of 100 kernel variants of CONV for all shapes. Of course, it integrates with Pytorch and other frameworks.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;hk4QGpQAvSY?t=57 reply intended 4 hours agorootparentprevYes!

Now, they&#x27;re as expensive, if not sometimes more expensive, than any other taxi or ridesharing service in my area.One thing I&#x27;ll add is that it&#x27;s not always that this ends with higher prices in an absolute sense, but that the tech company is able to essentially cut the knees out of their competitors until they&#x27;re a shell of their former selves. Then when the prices go \"up\", they&#x27;re in a way a return to the \"norm\", only they have a larger and dominant market share because of their crazy pricing in the early stages. reply wkat4242 13 hours agorootparentYeah I kinda wonder why people even use them anymore.

My theory is that, going forward, we&#x27;re going to see a much lower ceiling on revenue coupled with lots of competition in the market as VC investments cool off and companies can&#x27;t spend their way into ephemeral market dominance.As for Unity, they&#x27;re certainly dealing with a bunch of underperforming PE and IPO-enabled M&A on the one hand (really should have considered that AppLovin offer, folks), but also just a failure to extract reasonable income from their flagship product on the other; I don&#x27;t think their problems come from raising prices per se (game devs pay for a lot already, an engine fee is nothing new to them) as much as how they chose to do it and the original pricing model they tried to force on their clients.

If not, it&#x27;s just a battle between groups of researchers and server farms to see who is best this week or next. reply mbb70 11 hours agorootparentBut that&#x27;s exactly what they have: millions of high quality, rated chat interactions that no one else has.I don&#x27;t know how they could _not_ incorporate customer usage to improve their models. reply omeze 10 hours agorootparentwell, this assumes the chat (where the ratings are given) is what people are using and paying for. I think most businesses pay for some combination of API access and specific use cases like code generation (at least, thats what I pay for) that don&#x27;t really impact RLHF data. General search for consumers is likely to schism since chatGPT isn&#x27;t especially different from Bard or Edge&#x27;s AI assistant or the myriad of other product surface areas that can add it. replyzarzavat 13 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a different situation computationally. Transformers are asymmetric: hard to train but easy to run.There is no such thing as an open source Google because Google’s value is in its vast data centers.

It’s about 220B parameters, if you believe geohot, or perhaps more if you don’t.One hard drive. reply shihab 13 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding is that Google search is a lot more than just Pagerank (Map reduce for example). They had lots of heuristics, data, machine learning before anyone else etc.Whereas the underlying algorithms behind all these GPTs so far are broadly same. Yes, OpenAI does probably have better data, model finetuning and other engineering techniques now, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s anything special that&#x27;ll allow themselves to differentiate themselves from competitors in the long run.(If the data collected from a current LLM user in improving model proves very valuable, that&#x27;s different.

These capabilities are free (or at least don&#x27;t require an extra sub), and just used to sell more hardware.OpenAI is clearly going to compete in that market with its upcoming smart phone or device [1]. But what revenue model can OpenAI use to compete with Apple&#x27;s and not get undercut by it? I suppose hardware + free GPT3.5, and optional subscription to GPT4 (or whatever their highest end version is). Maybe that will be competitive.I also wonder what mobile OS OpenAI will choose. Probably not Android, otherwise they would have partnered with Google. A revamped and updated Microsoft mobile OS maybe, given their MS partnership? Or something new and bespoke? I could imagine Johnny Ive demanding something new, purpose-built, and designed from scratch for a new AI-oriented UI&#x2F;UX paradigm.A market for increasingly sophisticated AI that can only be done in huge GPU datacenters will exist, and that&#x27;s probably where the margins will be for a long time.

Apple&#x27;s strategy is to embed local AI in all their devices.

For some things yes, that&#x27;s definitely true. But for other things that are real-time or near real-time where network latency would be unacceptable, we&#x27;re already there. For example, Google&#x27;s Pixel 8 launch includes real-time audio processing&#x2F;enhancing which is made possible by their new Tensor chip.I&#x27;m no fan of Apple, but I think they&#x27;re on the right path with local AI. It may even be possible that the tendency of other device makers to put AI in the cloud might give Apple a much better user experience, unless Google can start thinking local-first which kind of goes against their grain. reply SkyMarshal 14 hours agorootparent> But for other things that are real-time or near real-time where network latency would be unacceptable, we&#x27;re already there.Agreed. Something else I wonder is if local AI in mobile devices might be better able to learn from its real-time interactions with the physical world than datacenter-based AI.It&#x27;s walking around in the world with a human with all its various sensors recording in real-time (unless disabled) - mic, camera, GPS&#x2F;location, LiDAR, barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity, ambient light, etc. Then the human uses it to interact with the world too in various ways.All that data can of course be quickly sent to a datacenter too, and integrated into the core system there, so maybe not. But I&#x27;m curious about this difference and wonder what advantages local AI might eventually confer. reply freedomben 12 hours agorootparentThis is a fascinating thought! It could send all the data to the cloud, but all those sensors going all the time would be a lot of constant data to send, and would use a lot of mobile data which would be unacceptable to many people (including probably the mobile networks). If it&#x27;s running locally though, the data could we quickly analyzed and probably deleted, avoiding long term storage issues. There&#x27;s got to be a lot of interesting things you could do with that kind of data reply sharemywin 14 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if you could send the embeddings or some higher level compressed latent vector across the cloud you couldn&#x27;t get the best of both worlds.GPS, phone orientation, last 5 apps you were in, etc. --> embeddingyou might even have like \"what time is it?\" compressed as it&#x27;s own embedding. reply huevosabio 14 hours agoparentprevOpenAI will make its money on enterprise deals for finetuning their latest and greatest on corporate data. They are already having this big enterprise deals and I think that&#x27;s where the money is.They will keep pricing the off-the-shelf AI at-cost to keep competitors at bay.As for competitors, Anthropic is the most similar to OpenAI both in capabilities and business model. I am not sure what Google is up to, since historically their focus has been in using AI to enhance their products rather than making it a product. The \"dark horses\" here are Stability and Mistral which both are OSS and European and will try to make that their edge as they give the models for _free_ but to institutional clients that are more sensitive to the models being used and where is the data being handled.Amazon and Apple are probably catching up.

Ensorceled 12 hours agoI like this, quick and simple to use. For example, adding images to tokens was a breeze .Couple of suggestions from a heavy user of Roll20 ...Too many menus and all look slightly different: you have left and right panels, the menu and the hover tool bar. Put the menu at the top of the right panel and, if you close it, have a simple30sec in Chrome. Most people would just bounce on that.Also, most RPG players are aware of Roll20, so why not give a brief head-to-head comparison (on your webpage)? reply audiodude 9 hours agoprevA bit tangential, but I&#x27;m not sure I could ever play D&D on a VTT. I understand the allure of playing over the internet in general, because you can pick outlandish times and don&#x27;t have to be geographically collocated. But for me, D&D is more than moving tokens around, it&#x27;s primarily about the roleplay, about acting out a character and seeing someone&#x27;s full facial, verbal, and non-verbal responses. If I want to push tokens around I&#x27;ll play some multiplayer RPG computer game. reply bigstrat2003 5 hours agoparentLike YakiSauce said, for most people playing on roll20 (or similar) it&#x27;s not their first choice. They can play online, or not at all. For what it&#x27;s worth though, roll20 does support video as well as voice, for exactly the reasons you mentioned. I&#x27;m guessing other platforms would as well. reply nmeagent 5 hours agoparentprevWhy not do both? I run a five-player in-person D&D 5e campaign with a VTT (Foundry) and it works out pretty well for us. We offload much of the bookkeeping, tokens, maps, etc. to the VTT and still keep the in-person RP experience. reply YakiSauce 8 hours agoparentprevFor us, we&#x27;d definitely prefer to play in person if we could. But like you mentioned, geography can be a real restriction. The times we have managed to play in person have been great. reply wolverine876 5 hours agoparentprevAnother way to look at VTTs is that they take care of the grunt work and give you more time for the things you want. reply rcarr 12 hours agoprevRather than using the menu drop down button, I would integrate that into the title of the right panel, so you click the title of the panel and that brings up the options for each section like \"Add Tokens, Map Details\" etc. I&#x27;d also move the exit campaign button out of that menu as it doesn&#x27;t really affect the right panel so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it belongs there. I think I&#x27;d put it on a permanent overlay in the top left corner over the dice history, and maybe have a confirm exit pop up modal with a setting to turn the modal off. I think I&#x27;d also add a way to collapse the dice history panel. reply YakiSauce 12 hours agoparentInteresting ideas. I&#x27;ll take a look at how those would feel. Thanks for the feedback! reply losvedir 18 hours agoprevNeat. My friends and I have a campaign going on roll20.net. I don&#x27;t suppose there&#x27;s any way to \"import\" our current stuff into here? Is this just for new campaigns? Our DM manages everything so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what&#x27;s involved (I think he&#x27;s purchased some add-ons maybe) or if this is even a sensible question. reply YakiSauce 17 hours agoparentHey yeah, totally sensible question - wish I had a better answer. Unfortunately there isn&#x27;t a great way to transfer an ongoing campaign. That&#x27;s one of the main issues with getting folks to try out new virtual tabletops - there&#x27;s some pretty established platforms already out there and there&#x27;s a fair amount of lock in. Especially if you consider the assets a lot of DMs have purchased on those platforms, like you mentioned.But I&#x27;m hoping eventually Diceright will have enough &#x27;killer features&#x27; that people will give it a shot anyway. Would be great if you guys would consider it once you finish your current campaign. Thanks! reply secabeen 13 hours agorootparentThere is a converter from Roll20 to FoundryVTT.

I&#x27;ve seen a lot of these out there for DnD specifically, and am always impressed by how polished they seem, but I&#x27;ve long since wished there was a better way to play WH40k or other wargames online. The closest thing seems to be Tabletop Simulator, which just feels strange as a full 3D simulator.It strikes me as slightly ironic, since games like 40k are traditionally extremely high $ investment hobbies, so seemingly a good market for the side-hustle tech crowd. reply tpmoney 15 hours agoparentIf you haven’t seen it yet you might look at Vassal https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vassalengine.org&#x2F; which is geared towards board games generally rather than ttrpgs reply bbor 14 hours agoparentprevI agree! I think it’s super doable to annotate a real game with modern image segmentation running on a video feed paired with rock-solid modern TTS as dice are read, turns are declared, etc. From there, it’s just a hop skip and jump to a virtual tabletop, AR set pieces, and (IMO the holy grail) non-local AR games using real pieces. It’s such a procedural, probabilistic, simplified-spatially game; seems perfect for simulation.I really don’t think games workshop has the corporate culture to catch this wave though, which makes the prospect of a IP lawsuit a big deterrent to even OS work.Msg me if you want a link to my last pass at it as a react app. Got slowed down figuring out how to offload work onto the server efficiently, and also daunted at the prospect of translating all the simpler unit rules into JSON.

What were some of the hard things about this project that you didn&#x27;t expect? reply YakiSauce 18 hours agoparentThanks!Man, so many things. I think maybe the hardest thing was really getting into the weeds of all the class&#x2F;race features and modeling them all in a way that made sense to the user and would &#x27;just work&#x27;.There are features that add damage, but only under some circumstances. Features that change at different levels. Features where you get to pick between a few options and then they also change at different levels. Just a lot to model out. And a lot of hard decisions about how much to automate and how much to leave on the user.Also, designing and building it all to work on mobile ended up being more than I expected because when adding new features I often had to go back and make it mobile friendly too.Oh and doing the dynamic lighting (where you can add walls and lights to a map and &#x27;see&#x27; what player tokens would see) was pretty tough because it involved learning some math to do those calculations. But that was also pretty fun. reply hackan 17 hours agoprevThis is pretty cool!! Is this FOSS? reply flaque 14 hours agoprevThis is great!

It looks great and very useful. reply miah_ 17 hours agoprevThis is neat, but so far every thing like this that we&#x27;ve used for our D&D game has been overkill.What we do currently:Take a map from a PDF, load in Paint program (paint.net&#x2F;photoshop&#x2F;gimp&#x2F;whatever), create a layer of BLACK over it. Share the screen. The DM slowly erases BLACK as we move and discover the map.This way, the players cannot see the map. The DM can see the map. The players get to slowly discover the map.We do dice rolls and type their output into chat. Our player sheets are player sheets, and we scanned and sent pdf&#x27;s to DM. We keep group inventory via chat. Everything else is basically overkill, because it requires the DM to redesign maps via some web app and DM&#x27;s already don&#x27;t have time.*editto be clear. we&#x27;ve looked into them all. the solution above is what we&#x27;ve now been doing for _years_ on our D&D game. Goddamn erake (our BBG). reply YakiSauce 17 hours agoparentTotally makes sense - different groups are different and whatever works for your group, works.With Diceright (and Im sure with other VTTs), my goal was to help streamline certain aspects of the game so players can focus on the fun stuff. Mostly around combat and tracking all your character details. So for combat, on Diceright, you can target enemies when you attack and then when you damage them, the player gets an alert with a CTA to apply the damage - so players aren&#x27;t always asking, wait who did you attack? How much was the damage again?And on the character sheet side, with a standard character sheet, I&#x27;ve often found myself looking at my AC or one of my stats and not totally remembering how I got to that number. Diceright keeps track of all your bonuses for you and shows you how your stats were calculated.Those are definitely all things you can do on your own, but it can be nice to have a computer automate them for you.Again, totally agree that the system you&#x27;ve got works. Just sharing some of my considerations when I went into building this. reply danudey 16 hours agorootparentThe #1 issue I&#x27;ve had with online VTTs is getting the VTT&#x27;s grid aligned with the map&#x27;s grid. I tried this with your solution and the problem was the same; it creates a grid and assumes the grid starts at the very edge of the image and goes to the other edge, meaning that if I want those grids to actually line up then I have to crop the image carefully, which is a huge hassle.Two things that would make this tool easier to use:1. Let me manually tune the grid in the VTT to the size of the grid in the image, either by selecting one square and having the system adjust the size and position of the grid to that, or by selecting some number of squares and specifying how many squares I selected, which would give a more accurate measurement.2. Let me draw rooms with a box tool as well as walls with the wall tool, and let those rooms (by default) snap to the grid. Extra points if I can create a box and then add new vertices to drag out a less boxy shape (i.e. to add alcoves, cutouts, etc).I haven&#x27;t yet seen a VTT that can handle grids and boxes and rooms automatically, but as soon as someone figures out how to do AI or machine learning-powered map analysis to turn an image of a map into a (mostly? partly?) usable setup (with tweaks to be done afterwards) is going to get a lot of attention. reply VonGuard 17 hours agoparentprevThe big reason we do this is that being a DM, it&#x27;s REALLY hard to predict what your players are going to do. I used to spend days preparing for a game, only to have the party turn around and wander out of the dungeon 10 minutes into the session, negating all my prep. This way, I can just throw up a map and have them dungeon crawl.I suppose it make a difference that we are playing Rappan Attuk and not a mainline D&D campaign. There&#x27;s a lot less dungeon crawling in today&#x27;s D&D, but Rappan Attuk makes up for all of it with about 600 pages of one dungeon. reply jncfhnb 17 hours agorootparentI don’t understand how dungeon crawling really felt fun for people. Or random encounters. It just doesn’t seem like a good system for fighting for fun.I always hear the cursed phrase “I guess I attack?”And that’s how I know the fight kind of sucks. reply david2ndaccount 15 hours agorootparentThe dungeon itself is the game&#x2F;puzzle&#x2F;challenge that the players are trying to overcome, either for the default goal of finding its treasure or for a specific goal like find a specific macguffin or other target. In this mode, the players trade their resources to overcome challenges and if you can achieve your goal without fighting or expending resources at all, the more the players are able to achieve. The default is not to fight every monster you encounter but to decide if you need to engage to achieve your goal. Random encounters are a way for the dungeon to fight back against the players and to put a clock on them - the longer they take to explore the dungeon or the less efficient they are in their exploration, the more they will have to deal with encounters that are unlikely to have any treasure at all.It’s a very complex and interesting game to play. Unfortunately newer editions have gutted this gameplay by removing xp for gold (thus removing the default goal of most dungeons) and removing all of the procedural dungeon crawling rules. The tabletop form is still superior to CRPGs as your ability to interact with the world itself and overcome challenges in interesting ways is only limited by your imagination and ability to creatively apply the tools available to your character. reply mrinterweb 16 hours agorootparentprevThe unlimited potential for creativity and collaborative story telling is what sets TTRPGs apart from video games. The mechanical side of D&D combat is fun, but I don&#x27;t think going all in on encounters is what makes D&D shine. A good combo of game mechanics and creativity is the sweet spot in my opinion.I often prefer \"theater of the mind\" over maps as that can be much more open-ended and encourage creativity. Many of the D&D podcasts use \"theater of the mind\", and they are great (special shout out to naddpod.com) reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentprevNowadays we have multiple genres of combat and mechanics focused video games. (FromSoft games, to CRPGs like Baldur’s Gate, to tactics games like Xcom).In the 70’s, that space was much less populated, so pencil and paper RPGs might have been the best small tactical games people could get their hands on (not everybody wanted to sell their houses for Warhammer miniatures). reply rolph 15 hours agorootparentprevsome people love and thrill on dice.D&D is rooted in a dice and miniatures, wargame, light on the scenario buildinghttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chainmail_(game)enough people liked it, and enough model,miniature, hobby was around that it held, and became more embellished over time. reply WendyTheWillow 16 hours agoparentprevBasically every single tool available can support this, and so much much more.I wouldn’t suggest you change, but to suggest this method is in any way superior to actually learning the tools and how they work is ridiculous.And if a DM can’t spare the hour or so to reach parity with this method, that’s gonna be a long term problem for the table. reply miah_ 14 hours agorootparentThe cost, and setup time to use any of these tools has been far greater than loading up a image and sharing it.We&#x27;ve found no VTT tool that can do basic fog of war _without_ loading in a bunch of other features we simply don&#x27;t need.Is it superior? I never said that, I said that the feature set was overkill.A long term problem? Like I said above, our game has been going for _4_ years.A big problem with these tools is the assumption that your players won&#x27;t do something you didn&#x27;t plan for. Which the system I described deals with well. Our DM has many times spent hours planning our game only for us to spend the entire time slot in one location, or deciding to go somewhere else. When that happens, all he has to do is roll out the setting for us to use our imaginations, or to load up a new image and black layer and share it, 5 - 10 minutes tops. reply opdahl 6 hours agorootparentI suggest checking out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tarrasque.io&#x2F; it might just be exactly what you are looking for. reply WendyTheWillow 12 hours agorootparentprevNo, a big assumption of using a map is that your players will do something you didn’t plan for.

The overlap between the two communities is very large and passionate. Foundry is selfhostable but it&#x27;s a clunky proprietary node.js application and there&#x27;s a ton of janky UI issues. Roll20 is far worse. I presume that this Diceright project is better since it&#x27;s actually using a canvas. But why doesn&#x27;t someone just use a proper game engine that can target the web (with wasm&#x2F;emscripten&#x2F;etc)? You&#x27;re making a game after all, and it would mean that people who are happy downloading and running a native application locally for better UX would be able to.[1] edit: That I was aware of when writing this comment initially. reply tomlagier 17 hours agoparentNit: Foundry uses Pixi.js for rendering, so it&#x27;s using more or less standard JS gamedev tools to draw on a WebGL context in a canvas.Edit: See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foundryvtt.wiki&#x2F;en&#x2F;development&#x2F;guides&#x2F;pixiEdit2: For an example of why gamedev toolkits don&#x27;t necessarily produce performant, highly usable software, check out Dungeondraft (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dungeondraft.net&#x2F;).

Just build a framework for the players to interact in according to the basic mechanics of tabletop games and then expose a rich module API and hand it off to users.

For us it was always about making a story together, and nothing bogs that down faster than technicality.If your game is centered around maps and minatures, is it also centered around combat?

When I first started playing DnD the thing I loved the most was the combat. Loved the mechanics and loved that it was basically a big complex board game.Over time, I have started moving more towards the shared storytelling aspects of the game. Currently in our game, we do a light combat mix, where we only really enter combat once every 3 or 4 sessions.Generally, it&#x27;s nice that there are so many different RPG systems out there now so people can really find the ones that fit what they like. reply breakfastduck 14 hours agoparentprevLots of people play D&D entirely for combat.

To that end, I wanted to make it easy to sign on and get started, right away. And I wanted to make it easy to use on your phone. Foundry has a ton going for it, but it does require initial work to get set up and it can be a bit clunky for someone who&#x27;s never used it.Similarly, I wanted to make character creation as seamless as possible. On Diceright you just pick your classes and all the features get added automatically and rolled up to your overall character sheet (and of course you can modify anything you&#x27;d like). It&#x27;s easy to make characters quickly and at the same time, you never lose track of where features or stat bonuses come from.All that being said, Foundry as a ton of stuff that Diceright doesn&#x27;t have yet, so I&#x27;m not trying to say it can go toe to toe on features.

Maybe I was expecting more clear rules of how to \"win\"? It seemed like it was more of a \"choose you&#x27;re own adventure\" story rather than a game since the dungeon master is able to change the rules as you go and pretty much decide whether or not you are \"successful\" with whatever goals are established at the beginning. Is that accurate? In the end, it was a little frustrating and I decided I don&#x27;t get it so I&#x27;ve never tried again. reply caffeinewriter 17 hours agoparentI&#x27;d call D&D more of a framework for collaborative storytelling that can absolutely be played as a game. The DM leads the adventure, the players decide how to respond to things. Everyone plays D&D a bit differently.The most straightforward adventures that typically have a \"win condition\" are one shots&#x2F;self-contained adventures from either WoTC or 3rd Party Publishers, like Curse of Strahd, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, etc.However, a lot of D&D groups I&#x27;ve played with might have characters die, but will rarely have a group \"lose\". However, because every group runs things a bit differently, a different group can drastically change how the game feels. reply tnecniv 17 hours agoparentprevCorrect. It is much more free form than other games (and even more free form RPGs exist).Every group has their own style. The DM might be very strict or loose with his reading of the rules. Players could be more or less into the role playing aspect (do you have to do voices and talk in character or not). Ultimately, your character can do whatever the DM allows them to do. That might seem “unfair” but the DM is not your opponent trying to beat you, they’re telling a story with you.There’s not really a win condition. Some groups play campaign modules which are pre-written stories the DM interprets for your group. Some make it up on the fly like an improv comedy group or nerd jazz. reply wincy 17 hours agoparentprevI play D&D because I’m hyper competitive and D&D doesn’t trip that “competing against other people” that makes me short circuit (and often spend a ton of money, Magic The Gathering especially got me so I won’t play that at all anymore) while still being that same kind of fun. It’s a way to hang out with my friends and tell a group story that’s fun to talk about and reminisce about “the time the evil demon lord tried to fly away and the Druid called upon the power of nature and hit him with a lightning bolt”. Or “that time the bard sold his soul to a devil”.I don’t really remember specific combat we remember the fun and stories we told, even if they’re pretty lame compared to just reading a book. But they’re our unique story.And if I put a ton of time into D&D that looks like “3D printing terrain” or “painting miniatures” (which are cool little statues so have some inherent aesthetic value) which are also fun hobbies (in my opinion) vs “accruing lots of thin pieces of cardboard” or “number goes up on screen”. reply eks391 4 hours agoparentprevWhen I first started playing I had the same reaction as you. I was trying to win and the rules didn&#x27;t seem clear. I continued not because I liked the game, but because I enjoyed the company of my friends, even if the activity didn&#x27;t make sense to me.Now, whether as DM or player, I enjoy it not as a game to win, but as a story to explore. Like an interactive movie. Even when I am the author of the plot as DM, I can&#x27;t predict what my players will do, and it becomes an enjoyable discovery as they force plot twists from their end. reply delecti 17 hours agoparentprevThere are usually fairly clear rules for executing the steps in a combat (what actions are \"legal\" on a character&#x27;s turn), but the characters&#x27; goals in a campaign are entirely subjective. The overall flow of a campaign is collaborative storytelling: the DM sets the scene, but the characters decide their actions at any given point along the way, and having clearly delineated \"go here next\" is often viewed as a sign the DM is being too controlling.Think of Lord of the Rings (both because it&#x27;s a good example to make my point, and because it&#x27;s the source of a lot of the inspiration for D&D). All the fellowship are independently given a vague mission to go to Rivendell. They then decide, in Rivendell, to embark on a quest to take the ring to Mordor. Consequences split them up on separate missions along the way; in a D&D game, splitting the party is poor etiquette, but it&#x27;s a good example of how your immediate next steps can change in unpredictable ways. The overall journey of any given character is decided by that character based on their circumstances and personal values. reply Arch485 17 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s not entirely accurate. D&D _is_ a choose your own adventure, and there&#x27;s not necessarily a way to \"win\"^1.

Page 236 of the 5th Edition Dungeon Master’s Guide addresses three valid approaches with pros and cons (nominally to the dice, but because of the role the dice play implicitly to the rules as a whole) ranging from using the rules, stats, and dice rolls for everything, to using the DM’s narrative judgment for everything, to a hybrid blended approach. (Previous editions of the rules had similar license to the same range of approaches with different framing.) reply bigstrat2003 5 hours agorootparentI would still say that in no case is the DM supposed to just change the rules as they go along. Whatever the method used by the DM, it should really be consistently applied. reply bigstrat2003 17 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re right, D&D is more of a choose your own adventure than a game which you are meant to win or lose. It&#x27;s group storytelling, where you&#x27;re all writing the story as you go based on what happens.It&#x27;s not exactly accurate that the DM can change the rules as you go. The DM will sometimes say you can&#x27;t do x or y, but a good DM doesn&#x27;t do that capriciously. When I DM, I sometimes tell players flat-out \"you can&#x27;t do that\", but it&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve tried to do something which isn&#x27;t possible in the fictional world (like if someone says they want to jump so high they land on the moon or whatever). Most of the time, when a player says they want to do something, they should either succeed outright (because it&#x27;s not actually challenging for the character to do), or the rules of the game will give a clear way to determine success&#x2F;failure.

I&#x27;d definitely encourage you to give it another shot, maybe with a different DM that more fits what you&#x27;re looking for. But then again, it&#x27;s also definitely not for everyone.

Today, if there's traffic in the area and you want to follow the law, you need to find a crosswalk. And if there's a traffic light, you need to wait for it to change to green. IN THE 1920S, AUTO GROUPS REDEFINED WHO OWNED THE CITY STREET Fail to do so, and you're committing a crime: jaywalking. In some cities — Los Angeles, for instance — police ticket tens of thousands of pedestrians annually for jaywalking, with fines of up to $250. To most people, this seems part of the basic nature of roads. But it's actually the result of an aggressive, forgotten 1920s campaign led by auto groups and manufacturers that redefined who owned the city streets. \"In the early days of the automobile, it was drivers' job to avoid you, not your job to avoid them,\" says Peter Norton, a historian at the University of Virginia and author of Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City. \"But under the new model, streets became a place for cars — and as a pedestrian, it's your fault if you get hit.\" One of the keys to this shift was the creation of the crime of jaywalking. Here's a history of how that happened. When city streets were a public space Manhattan's Hester Street, on the Lower East Side, in 1914. (Maurice Branger/Roger Viollet/Getty Images) It's strange to imagine now, but prior to the 1920s, city streets looked dramatically different than they do today. They were considered to be a public space: a place for pedestrians, pushcart vendors, horse-drawn vehicles, streetcars, and children at play. \"Pedestrians were walking in the streets anywhere they wanted, whenever they wanted, usually without looking,\" Norton says. During the 1910s there were few crosswalks painted on the street, and they were generally ignored by pedestrians. As cars began to spread widely during the 1920s, the consequence of this was predictable: death. Over the first few decades of the century, the number of people killed by cars skyrocketed. (Courtesy of Peter Norton) Those killed were mostly pedestrians, not drivers, and they were disproportionately the elderly and children, who had previously had free rein to play in the streets. The public response to these deaths, by and large, was outrage. Automobiles were often seen as frivolous playthings, akin to the way we think of yachts today (they were often called \"pleasure cars\"). And on the streets, they were considered violent intruders. Cities erected prominent memorials for children killed in traffic accidents, and newspapers covered traffic deaths in detail, usually blaming drivers. They also published cartoons demonizing cars, often associating them with the Grim Reaper. The November 23, 1924, cover of the New York Times shows a common representation of cars during the era — as killing machines. (New York Times) Before formal traffic laws were put in place, judges typically ruled that in any collision, the larger vehicle — that is, the car — was to blame. In most pedestrian deaths, drivers were charged with manslaughter regardless of the circumstances of the accident. How cars took over the roads In 1925 Midtown Manhattan, pedestrians compete for space with increasing automobile traffic. (Edwin Levick/Getty Images) As deaths mounted, anti-car activists sought to slow them down. In 1920, Illustrated World wrote, \"Every car should be equipped with a device that would hold the speed down to whatever number of miles stipulated for the city in which its owner lived.\" The turning point came in 1923, says Norton, when 42,000 Cincinnati residents signed a petition for a ballot initiative that would require all cars to have a governor limiting them to 25 miles per hour. Local auto dealers were terrified, and sprang into action, sending letters to every car owner in the city and taking out advertisements against the measure. A 1923 ad in the Cincinnati Post, taken out by a coalition of auto dealers. (Cincinnati Post) The measure failed. It also galvanized auto groups nationwide, showing them that if they weren't proactive, the potential for automobile sales could be minimized. In response, automakers, dealers, and enthusiast groups worked to legally redefine the street — so that pedestrians, rather than cars, would be restricted. \"THIS IS THE TRAFFIC LAW THAT WE'RE STILL LIVING WITH TODAY\" The idea that pedestrians shouldn't be permitted to walk wherever they liked had been present as far back as 1912, when Kansas City passed the first ordinance requiring them to cross streets at crosswalks. But in the mid-20s, auto groups took up the campaign with vigor, passing laws all over the country. Most notably, auto industry groups took control of a series of meetings convened by Herbert Hoover (then secretary of commerce) to create a model traffic law that could be used by cities across the country. Due to their influence, the product of those meetings — the 1928 Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance — was largely based off traffic law in Los Angeles, which had enacted strict pedestrian controls in 1925. \"The crucial thing it said was that pedestrians would cross only at crosswalks, and only at right angles,\" Norton says. \"Essentially, this is the traffic law that we're still living with today.\" The shaming of jaywalking Government safety posters ridicule jaywalking in the 1920s and '30s. (National Safety Council/Library of Congress) Even while passing these laws, however, auto industry groups faced a problem: In Kansas City and elsewhere, no one had followed the rules, and they were rarely enforced by police or judges. To solve it, the industry took up several strategies. One was an attempt to shape news coverage of car accidents. The National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, an industry group, established a free wire service for newspapers: Reporters could send in the basic details of a traffic accident and would get in return a complete article to print the next day. These articles, printed widely, shifted the blame for accidents to pedestrians — signaling that following these new laws was important. Similarly, AAA began sponsoring school safety campaigns and poster contests, crafted around the importance of staying out of the street. Some of the campaigns also ridiculed kids who didn't follow the rules — in 1925, for instance, hundreds of Detroit school children watched the \"trial\" of a 12-year-old who'd crossed a street unsafely, and, as Norton writes, a jury of his peers sentenced him to clean chalkboards for a week. This was also part of the final strategy: shame. In getting pedestrians to follow traffic laws, \"the ridicule of their fellow citizens is far more effective than any other means which might be adopted,\" said E.B. Lefferts, the head of the Automobile Club of Southern California in the 1920s. Norton likens the resulting campaign to the anti-drug messaging of the '80s and '90s, in which drug use was portrayed as not only dangerous but stupid. At a 1924 New York safety parade, a jaywalking clown is repeatedly rammed by a slow-moving Model T. (Courtesy of the Barron Collier Company, via Peter Norton) Auto campaigners lobbied police to publicly shame transgressors by whistling or shouting at them — and even carrying women back to the sidewalk — instead of quietly reprimanding or fining them. They staged safety campaigns in which actors dressed in 19th-century garb, or as clowns, were hired to cross the street illegally, signifying that the practice was outdated and foolish. In a 1924 New York safety campaign, a clown was marched in front of a slow-moving Model T and rammed repeatedly. This strategy also explains the name that was given to crossing illegally on foot: jaywalking. During this era, the word \"jay\" meant something like \"rube\" or \"hick\" — a person from the sticks, who didn't know how to behave in a city. So pro-auto groups promoted use of the word \"jay walker\" as someone who didn't know how to walk in a city, threatening public safety. At first, the term was seen as offensive, even shocking. Pedestrians fired back, calling dangerous driving \"jay driving.\" But jaywalking caught on (and eventually became one word). Safety organizations and police began using it formally, in safety announcements. Use of the word \"jaywalking\" increases steeply starting in the 1920s. (Google Ngram Viewer) Ultimately, both the word jaywalking and the concept that pedestrians shouldn't walk freely on streets became so deeply entrenched that few people know this history. \"The campaign was extremely successful,\" Norton says. \"It totally changed the message about what streets are for.\" Further reading: Peter Norton's \"Street Rivals: Jaywalking and the Invention of the Motor Age Street\" 99% Invisible's episode on jaywalking You've read 1 article in the last 30 days.

When it became illegal, none of the underlying things that had become inherent disappeared overnight.As an example, banks refused to lend in minority neighborhoods, so unlike for white Americans who used loans to bid up houses owned by white Americans and got wealth that way, Black Americans actually experienced negative housing wealth growth. Those areas are still poor, but now banks don’t lend in them because they’re not profitable, even though the reason they are not profitable is that they were never lent to in the first place.When Black people managed to build parallel financial systems and economies to provide them wealth, usually they got their properties burned down or firebombed for their trouble. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tulsa_race_massacre reply voisin 10 hours agoparentprevI’ve heard several times but never verified that trees aren’t planted on boulevards anymore because of automaker lobbying.

(a) Every pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right of way to all vehicles upon the roadway. (b) Any pedestrian crossing a roadway at a point where a pedestrian tunnel or overhead pedestrian crossing has been provided shall yield the right of way to all vehicles upon the roadway. (c) No pedestrian shall cross a roadway intersection diagonally unless authorized by official traffic-control devices; and, when authorized to cross diagonally, pedestrians shall cross only in accordance with the official traffic-control devices pertaining to such crossing movements.So what&#x27;s criminalized isn&#x27;t crossing the road - it&#x27;s crossing without checking. Which seems like a good idea to me. Looking on the other side of the spectrum, Wyoming&#x27;s law is: (a) Every pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway. (b) Any pedestrian crossing a roadway at a point where a pedestrian tunnel or overhead pedestrian crossing has been provided shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway. (c) Between adjacent intersections at which traffic-control signals are in operation pedestrians shall not cross at any place except in a marked crosswalk. (d) No pedestrian shall cross a roadway intersection diagonally unless authorized by official traffic-control devices. When authorized to cross diagonally, pedestrians shall cross only in accordance with the official traffic-control devices pertaining to the crossing movements.Which is similar, except for (c), which only matters when you&#x27;re close to a crosswalk - and almost certainly, on a busy road. reply digital-cygnet 13 hours agoparentI think you&#x27;ve misunderstood the law you&#x27;ve quoted. It&#x27;s not about \"crossing without checking\", it&#x27;s about the pedestrian \"yield[ing] the right of way to all vehicles\". It&#x27;s hard to imagine from a modern perspective, but until laws like this were passed roads were not, as today, universally perceived as places for cars to drive.In cities in much of the developing world the pre-jaywalking regime remains: road users with cars, carts, bikes, trucks, or on foot instead are in a delicate and complex (and often dangerous) dance of theory-of-mind and courtesy (or a game of chicken, depending).The \"right-of-way\" dominated way of thinking about roads is hard to argue with when you look at most roadways in the developed world (cars zooming around on multiple lanes with few pedestrians in sight). But the idea that every pedestrian must yield right of way to every car is much more questionable in dense cities like NYC, on small, residential streets, where one car trying to go from point A to point C is effectively given total preference over all the people trying to live their lives (and cross the street) in B. reply chrisco255 12 hours agorootparentOf course not, but the same right-of-way concept applied to horse and buggies sharing the same street and streetcars on rails, not to mention railroads, which certainly zoomed by pedestrians in many urban areas.If you want it back to the old way of chaos on the streets, then you&#x27;ll have to admit that horses would regularly shit all over the street and pedestrians would have to be far more careful in another sense as they crossed busy roads of buggies, streetcars and early autos zipping around with no lanes or traffic lights.The modern system evolved because it made sense given the demand load and traffic.

Pedestrians were pushing back on cars because they were so deadly; from the article: \"The November 23, 1924, cover of the New York Times shows a common representation of cars during the era — as killing machines. (New York Times)\". It was automakers who deliberately propagandised and lobbied to shift public perception of blame from the person in control of the heavy machinery in a public place, to victim blame the pedestrian.> \"The modern system evolved because it made sense\"No, it evolved because it was profitable (to the automakers) and beneficial to the rich (more likely car owners) and powerful (white &#x2F; preferred a country residence and a drive into town, but didn&#x27;t like a streetcar letting poor black people out to the suburbs). Automakers colluded to tear up Los Angeles&#x27; electric streetcar network - the largest on the planet - and scrap it. They were found guilty in court and fined ... $1. That&#x27;s not because it made sense, that&#x27;s to make people more dependent on their products.> \"Cars have to follow rules, too, and have to stop at intersections, yield at crosswalks, obey speed limits, etc.\"Yet they still put out fumes which affect the residents of the area they drive through, while not affecting the driver inside the car. These fumes kill a 9&#x2F;11 equivalent of people every 9 months in the UK[1]. They put out noise pollution which worsens the education and health of those around and the noise pollution effects kills someone in Denmark every day or two[2], but the driver is insulated from it. They could have had to be routed around pedestrian areas, living areas, and yield to pedestrians at all times, mandatory park and ride on the edge of urban areas with bus and tram and metro transit in the pedestrianised centers - which would have made sense in various ways and been beneficial for the majority, but inconvenient for the wealthier minority of car drivers. Cars don&#x27;t obey speed limits in a lot of situations; people drive some combination of the speed others are driving, what they think they can get away with, or what feels safe for the design style of the road.The USA is up to a 9&#x2F;11 of car accident deaths every two weeks.[3] Compare the response to that, to the nationwide implementation of the TSA and changes to air travel after 9&#x2F;11.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-environment-17704116[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brainfacts.org&#x2F;Thinking-Sensing-and-Behaving&#x2F;Die...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forcetechnology.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;traffic-noise-danger...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in... reply KennyBlanken 11 hours agorootparentOne of the reasons the Dutch transportation system is so radically different is because there was strong backlash to rising child deaths from motor vehicles - aka Stop de Kindermoord.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stop_de_Kindermoordhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;usa.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;the-origins-of-hollan...In the Netherlands in many residential areas, the streets are primarily for walking and bicycling; drivers must yield to everything else, because they are the greatest danger on the road. There&#x27;s extensive, comprehensive separated cycling infrastructure. There&#x27;s a presumption of fault, not innocence, if you hit a cyclist or pedestrian with your car.In the US, guns have only recently overtaken motor vehicle related deaths (which have been declining) as the top killers of children.Unfortunately, the Dutch are weaponized against cycling infrastructure elsewhere. \"Well, you can&#x27;t have bicycles in the streets until you have comprehensively education of children in how to cycle\", for example (despite plenty of evidence that, around the world, cyclists do not break traffic laws more than drivers.) Or defeatist nonsense like \"there&#x27;s no point to legal protections for cyclists in the street, we must only work for separated infrastructure.\" reply tpmoney 11 hours agorootparentprevIn any shared transportation space, you need rules for right of way. When two modes of transport want to occupy the same exact space, someone has to be given a priority for the space at any given time. Almost all right of way rules require that the smaller and&#x2F;or more maneuverable vehicle gives right of way to larger less maneuverable vehicles. Examples of this: Trains have right of way, always. On water, jet skis must give way to boats which must give way to larger boats which must give way to ships. Every rule I&#x27;ve seen on cycling requires pedestrians to give right of way to bicycles.And more generally they almost always require the vehicle most able to prevent a collision to yield right of way to all other vehicles. Cars turning across or into traffic must yield to oncoming traffic. Cars making U-turns must yield to cars turning into traffic (to my understanding because a U turn crosses 2 directions of traffic, where a turning into traffic crosses 1). A car making a turn at a stop must yield to pedestrians already in or entering the road, because a stopped car merely needs to stay stopped to avoid a collision while a moving pedestrian must stop moving and clear the way first.Designated crosswalks by their very existence imply \"this is an area you should be especially aware of pedestrians\", which by nature makes it easier for a driver to avoid causing a collisions. If cross walks have been provided, it only makes sense to require pedestrians to use them if they want prioritized right of way. reply _dain_ 11 hours agorootparentThis is not how it works in the UK. There is no such thing as \"right of way\" on a road in the way you have described it. It does not refer to any kind of legal priority of one kind of road user over another. You will sometimes hear irate motorists complaining \"you can&#x27;t do that, I had the right of way!\" but it doesn&#x27;t mean what they think. The \"right of way\" simply means that the public has a right to use the way, by whatever lawful means -- on foot, on a bike, on a horse, etc. So, \"having the right of way\" is the tautology that you happen to physically occupy some chunk of public highway; it has no bearing on whether you were in the right.If the term meant what people thought, motorists would never have the right of way, since driving is not a right, but requires a license, and the ability to travel on public highways in cars is a creation of statute, not common law.Recent revisions of the Highway Code put about a hierarchy of road users, but opposite to the one you have put across. Smaller, slower, more vulnerable road users have priority over larger and faster vehicles.>Designated crosswalks by their very existence imply \"this is an area you should be especially aware of pedestrians\", which by nature makes it easier for a driver to avoid causing a collisions. If cross walks have been provided, it only makes sense to require pedestrians to use them if they want prioritized right of way.This begs the question. You only need specially designated areas where pedestrians might be, if it is otherwise dangerous for pedestrians to cross the road. Why build roads to be dangerous to pedestrians in the first place? Why should pedestrians have their freedoms curtailed because of the actions of motorists?In the UK, pedestrians are not required to use zebra crossings, nor are they even required to obey a red light at a pelican crossing (it is merely advisory). Britons have the absolute freedom to cross the road wherever and whenever they please, so long as it&#x27;s not on a motorway. You are simply allowed to use your own common sense and situational awareness. And we have far fewer traffic fatalities than North America, so maybe we are doing something right.>Every rule I&#x27;ve seen on cycling requires pedestrians to give right of way to bicycles.As a cyclist I find this idea appalling.

I assume not.To me what I&#x27;ve been able to find sounds an awful lot like pedestrians are required to exercise due caution, and like basically less strictly worded versions of most US laws. Like for example from these rules https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;the-highway-code&#x2F;rules-for-pedes...:\"D If traffic is coming, let it pass. Look all around again and listen. Do not cross until there is a safe gap in the traffic and you are certain that there is plenty of time. Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may be approaching very quickly.\"Or rule 8: \"If you have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, you have priority and they should give way (see Rules H2 and 170).\"Which certainly seems to imply that there are times when the pedestrian does not \"have priority\"Or this rule, which sounds an awful lot like the rule quoted from New York: \" Where there is a crossing nearby, use it. It is safer to cross using a subway, a footbridge, an island, a zebra, pelican, toucan or puffin crossing, or where there is a crossing point controlled by a police officer, a school crossing patrol or a traffic warden. Otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions. Try to avoid crossing between parked cars (see Rule 14), on a blind bend, or close to the brow of a hill. Move to a space where drivers and riders can see you clearly. Do not cross the road diagonally.\"This one sounds an awful lot to me like cars have \"right of way\" when the amber light is flashing and a pedestrian has not yet entered the cross walk: \"Pelican crossings. These are signal-controlled crossings where flashing amber follows the red ‘Stop’ light. You MUST stop when the red light shows. When the amber light is flashing, you MUST give way to any pedestrians on the crossing. If the amber light is flashing and there are no pedestrians on the crossing, you may proceed with caution.\"Even from H2 which is the main new thing I see citing the higher pedestrian priorities has \"Pedestrians have priority when on a zebra crossing, on a parallel crossing or at light controlled crossings when they have a green signal.\", which again certainly seems to say that when not on such a crossing or crossing against the lights that they do not have priority anymore.>This begs the question. You only need specially designated areas where pedestrians might be, if it is otherwise dangerous for pedestrians to cross the road. Why build roads to be dangerous to pedestrians in the first place?And yet, the UK is littered with pedestrian crossings. As near as I can tell you have an entire bestiary of different crossing types with different rules and regulations for each. Seems like they should be unnecessary if pedestrians have absolute priority over all other traffic right?> In the UK, pedestrians are not required to use zebra crossings, nor are they even required to obey a red light at a pelican crossing (it is merely advisory).This seems heavily contradicted multiple times from what I found above, but then there&#x27;s also this (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislation.gov.uk&#x2F;ukpga&#x2F;1984&#x2F;27&#x2F;section&#x2F;25&#x2F;2018...):\"(2)Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, regulations under that subsection may be made—(a)prohibiting pedestrian traffic on the carriageway within 100 yards of a crossing, and \"So that sounds like you absolutely can be compelled by law to use a crossing where one is nearby.> As a cyclist I find this idea appalling. What you are describing sounds like the Law of the Jungle.Why? To me it sounds like a law reflecting reality. You could say a pedestrian has the right of way but when a pedestrian tries to occupy the space a bicycle is already or will be within the time that they are unable to safely stop, physics says the pedestrian will lose that fight. That doesn&#x27;t mean cyclists can ride and just slam through joggers. Everyone is still requires to try to avoid collisions.It really feels like you have a misunderstanding of what \"right of way\" means here. This isn&#x27;t some absolute authority where cyclists may mow down pedestrians in front of them, and cars may mow down cyclists in front of them, and busses may mow down cars and trucks may mow down busses. It&#x27;s trying to resolve who needs to yield when a collision is likely to occur. As a general rule like I said, the person most able to prevent the collision in the first place is given lower right of way. A car already in a lane has right of way over a car trying to merge into the lane. That isn&#x27;t carte blanche to simply ram people merging into your lane out of the way, it just means the person wanting to merge has the responsibility to do so safely and not cause a collision, and if they can&#x27;t merge without causing a collision, they&#x27;re the one that has to wait. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 3 hours agorootparentprevBeen to Tbilisi recently, there is such strong preference for cars in the center, pedestrians need to walk ~10 min on average to find a crossing and then wait ~10 min for the green light. reply zarzavat 9 hours agorootparentprevThe UK has never had such a law (except on motorways), yet pedestrians know to stay off the roads because it is dangerous.In those developing countries the reason that there is chaos is because traffic rules are not enforced.

Horses and horse-drawn carriages were usually allowed on the street as well, which are more dangerous than a person.In car-centric culture, a street is simply a kind of road, and all roads are the primary domain of cars. There is no logical reason that this must be so - cars could, for instance, only have right-of-way on non-street roads, like highways.Also, your assertion that cars (even old cars) cannot travel at a low enough speed to have a safe stopping distance around pedestrians is simply not true. Even a collision between a pedestrian and a car at \"walking speed\" (if the car completely failed to notice the pedestrian) rarely results in a fatality. Which you can easily look up yourself, but the numbers I&#x27;m seeing are less than 1% fatality rate for collisions below 10mph. reply kasey_junk 13 hours agoparentprevJaywalking laws, independent of how they are implemented only make sense if you start from a prior that the roads are specifically for vehicular use snd it’s pedestrians that are making exceptional use of them.The article is pointing out that belief was a specific policy choice driven at least in part by automakers. reply mcmoor 10 hours agorootparentNot even motorized vehicles could cross the road either, mind you.

Nobody should be expected to walk a mile out of their way simply because that is where the only crosswalk is. Jaywalking is technically only possible near a crosswalk, so if the pedestrian was near a crosswalk but didn&#x27;t use it, then that would be jaywalking.

Vehicle traffic was allowed, and people could get out in front of the movie theater. The other side of the street, with no barriers, had cafe tables.[1]This worked badly. The cafe tables kept creeping outward. Some auto traffic was too fast. During COVID, the outside seating kept growing into the roadway. Plastic bollards were erected to discourage non-delivery traffic. Overpowered electric bikes zooming through became an problem. Police cars were sometimes deployed to block the roadway. Then plastic Jersey-type barriers were set up at one end, but not filled with water, so they could be moved for deliveries. Currently, one end of the street has been torn up for installation of some kind of raiseable barrier.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.google.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;@37.48560402,-122.22909676,5.07... reply ilaksh 15 hours agorootparentprevI think it comes down to things like speed.

The number of movements of people in a dense city is too large for everyone to move in a car, autonomous or not. Cars take a lot of space. They need to stop someplace for someone to get in and out, merge in and out of traffic. Streets cant be designed in a way that accomodates this at the scale of a city like NY.Similarly, in spread-out suburbia, autonomous cars would still get stuck in traffic jams if everyone has to use them to get to work.

For example, consider motorized transport. A walking man formerly could go where he pleased, go at his own pace without observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of technological support-systems. When motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man’s freedom. They took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn’t want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and farther than a walking man. But the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man’s freedom of locomotion. When automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to regulate their use extensively. In a car, especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one’s own pace one’s movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied down by various obligations: license requirements, driver test, renewing registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, monthly payments on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized transport is no longer optional. Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile for transportation. Or else they must use public transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when driving a car. Even the walker’s freedom is now greatly restricted. In the city he continually has to stop to wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic. In the country, motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway. (Note this important point that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized transport: When a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional. In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves FORCED to use it.)While technological progress AS A WHOLE continually narrows our sphere of freedom, each new technical advance CONSIDERED BY ITSELF appears to be desirable. Electricity, indoor plumbing, rapid long-distance communications ... how could one argue against any of these things, or against any other of the innumerable technical advances that have made modern society? It would have been absurd to resist the introduction of the telephone, for example. It offered many advantages and no disadvantages. Yet, as we explained in paragraphs 59-76, all these technical advances taken together have created a world in which the average man’s fate is no longer in his own hands or in the hands of his neighbors and friends, but in those of politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and bureaucrats whom he as an individual has no power to influence. [21] The same process will continue in the future. Take genetic engineering, for example. Few people will resist the introduction of a genetic technique that eliminates a hereditary disease. It does no apparent harm and prevents much suffering. Yet a large number of genetic improvements taken together will make the human being into an engineered product rather than a free creation of chance (or of God, or whatever, depending on your religious beliefs).Another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that, within the context of a given society, technological progress marches in only one direction; it can never be reversed. Once a technical innovation has been introduced, people usually become dependent on it, so that they can never again do without it, unless it is replaced by some still more advanced innovation. Not only do people become dependent as individuals on a new item of technology, but, even more, the system as a whole becomes dependent on it. (Imagine what would happen to the system today if computers, for example, were eliminated.) Thus the system can move in only one direction, toward greater technologization. Technology repeatedly forces freedom to take a step back, but technology can never take a step back—short of the overthrow of the whole technological system. reply sandworm101 16 hours agoprevHow quickly we forget history.

    "originBody": "{TokyoDev} Jobs Companies Articles Discord ••• POST A JOB GET THE NEWSLETTER Not setting up Find My bricked my MacBook Paul McMahon Founder of TokyoDev At the beginning of the year, I bought a new M2 MacBook Air for ¥220,800 (about 1,500 USD) on Apple Japan’s online store. Thanks to me not bothering to set up Find My, it’s now a worthless brick. To add insult to injury, I had paid ¥77,619 (500 USD) to have said brick returned to me. Apple could theoretically unbrick it, but refuses to do so. Don’t make the same mistake I did, and make sure you turn on Find My. Swapping MacBooks at airport security This all happened because I went through airport security. As one is required to do, I removed my Midnight Blue MacBook Air from my backpack, put it on a tray, and after it went through airport security, I picked it up again. Or so I thought. About 30 minutes before my flight was boarding, I pulled out my laptop to do some last minute work. But when I opened it up, a stranger’s profile greeted me. Evidently we had swapped laptops going through security. So I raced back, and returned the stranger’s laptop, and explained the situation. While security managed to identify the stranger’s flight, it had already taken off. I filled out the airport’s lost item form, and boarded the plane crestfallen. I hoped I’d recover the laptop, but to prepare for the worst, ordered another new MacBook using the plane’s wifi. I could always return it if my original MacBook was returned. An email from the United Arab Emirates A bit over a week after I lost my MacBook, I received an email from someone in the United Arab Emirates saying they had my laptop and asking if I had theirs. I don’t know how they found me, but I told them I had returned theirs to airport security, and asked for mine back. They agreed to send it back, but seemed a bit clueless as to how to return it. Part of this may have been because they didn’t have a fluent English ability. While it was a bit ambiguous to me who should be responsible for paying for the return from a moral perspective, it became clear the only way I’d get it back is if I ordered a courier to pick it for them. There was a lot of back and forth between us. But after about a month after receiving the initial email from the stranger, a package arrived from the UAE. Getting it delivered was quite expensive. DHL ended up charging me ¥66,519, which was more than the initial estimate they gave me. I also needed to pay ¥11,100 of import duties on it - it didn’t seem to matter that the MacBook was mine. A box filled with exotic scents and crushed dreams I eagerly opened the box, which had a distinctly exotic scent - perfume or spices, I couldn’t quite place it. Sure enough, there was a bubble wrapped Midnight Blue MacBook Air. Opening it up, there was a Japanese keyboard. Everything good so far. Booting it up, something was a bit strange though. Rather than being greet by my login screen, I saw “Activate Mac”, and was prompted to select a wifi network. I did this, and then was shown an “Activation Lock” screen. This Mac is linked to an Apple ID. Enter the Apple ID and password that was previously used with this Mac. p·····@icloud.com Weird. My Apple ID uses my tokyodev.com email address, not an iCloud one. There was an option to “Use Device Password”. Enter the password that was previously used to unlock this Mac. I entered my password. The operation couldn’t be completed. The password for this Mac can no longer be used to remove Activation Lock. The password was entered incorrectly too many times. Uh oh. What do I do now, I thought to myself. Some searching brought up Apple’s documentation about how to remove Activation Lock. If you need help removing Activation Lock and have proof of purchase documentation, you can start an Activation Lock support request. I bought the MacBook from Apple, and so I thought this should be straightforward enough. I went through their support request form, attaching the invoice their online store gave me. Then I waited. Apple refuses to disable the Activation Lock for me After two weeks of waiting, I got fed up, and contacted Apple’s normal support about it. Their support representative was able to confirm that I had submitted a request to disable the activation lock, but the team responsible for that had rejected my request the same day (but I didn’t receive any notification about it). The support representative wanted to really make sure of everything, and included having them use remote access on my iPhone. They were surprised to see that the locked MacBook was showing up in my list of iCloud devices, but a different iCloud account was showing up on the unlock screen of the MacBook. Eventually, they concluded there might have been a problem with how I submitted the support request. It asked for the purchase date. I entered the 請求日 (invoice date) whereas they thought I should have entered the 注文日 (order date). These were both in the receipt, but whatever, I submitted another request. Four days later I received an email about the first activation lock request. We are unable to process your request at this time. Ten days since I received that email, I still have not received any update on my second unlock request. How did it get locked in the first place? It remains a mystery as to how the Activation Lock got activated in the first place. I have a couple of theories though. I set up Find My with an Apple ID that I don’t remember That the iCloud address starts with a “p”, my first initial, is haunting me. Could it be that I somehow created an iCloud address when first setting up the MacBook? I certainly don’t remember doing this though. Furthermore, Apple ID requires you to have a phone number associated with the account, and only allows one phone number per account. My own phone number is already connected to my tokyodev.com account, so I would have needed to set it up with a different one, which seems impossible. The stranger wiped my MacBook, set it up for themselves, and turned on Find My The stranger did take an awfully long time to return my MacBook. Maybe this was because they were using it for themselves until their own was returned. If I hadn’t set up Find My for the MacBook, they should have been able to wipe it themselves. When they set it up for themselves, they could have set up Find My, and now the Activation Lock would be enabled. If they then reported the device as lost, Activation Lock should have been turned on. Furthermore, Apple explicitly states that they won’t remove the activation lock for devices in Lost Mode. I suppose this is theoretically possible. I did ask them if they recognized the icloud address, but they didn’t. The only way this makes any sense is if they were being malicious, but I doubt that’s the case. There’s a bug with Activation Lock Apple’s T2 Security Chip allows a maximum of 90 unlock attempts. If those attempts are exhausted, access to the disk should be unrecoverable, but it should be possible to wipe the MacBook by starting it in recovery mode. I tried doing this, but when doing so, I’m prompted to disable the Activation Lock. This is the expected behavior if Find My had been activated, but not if it wasn’t. The stranger could have tried to brute force my password. Eventually they exhausted the unlock attempts. What if there’s a bug in this case, and somehow the system is prompting me to unlock it via a non-existent Apple ID. My username starts with a “p”, so I could theoretically see a programmer using a username@icloud.com address as a placeholder. It seems unlikely that such a bug would slip through, but it is certainly possible. I’d love for someone at Apple to prove me wrong by explaining what actually happened. The problem with being too secure I get why Apple doesn’t want to tell me why they’re rejecting my requests to disable the activation lock, as it would help an attacker figure out how they might get a stolen MacBook unlocked. I also understand that they must receive a lot of requests in relation to MacBooks that people bought “used”, and so they want to minimize their time spent actually reviewing the requests. But come on! I bought the MacBook from Apple. I’m clearly the owner. They presumably can see that my Apple ID is associated with it. The only case I can think of where they legitimately shouldn’t unlock it is if I sold it to someone else and then stole it back from them. With removing the Activation Lock, I could only wipe the MacBook anyways. There’s no one’s data at stake. Surely in a case like this, it’s better to let me wipe it. Simultaneously being this strict and allowing MacBooks to be set up without turning on Find My creates a channel for abuse. An attacker could “prank” someone by wiping their MacBook, activating it with their own Apple ID, and then reporting it as lost. The victim then has no way to recover it. Since Apple isn’t able to handle legitimate requests to disable the Activation Lock like mine, you should turn on Find My on your own MacBook, or risk it becoming a brick like mine.

I was running and an AirPod fell out of my ear and I just happened to be by a drainage drain. It fell through the grate. I immediately rode my bike to the Apple Store (still with a working case and left AirPod) and purchased a replacement right AirPod. The Apple person who helped disconnected the left one and told me to have it plugged in for 30 minutes so the case and AirPods could reconnect and connect to my phone.Except they didn&#x27;t. I brought it back to Apple after lots of phone calls and troubleshooting and Apple has now told me that something must have gotten messed up with the software. I am able to buy a new pair of AirPods if I would like to, or I can spend $250 for them to diagnose the issue (the price of a new set of AirPods).I can&#x27;t imagine having a problem like this that seems so obvious to be a software bug and passing that cost down to the consumer instead of making it right. I left the Apple Store in a worse situation than when I arrived. I had a working case and one working AirPod. I left with having spent $90 on my replacement AirPod, with none of them working.I worked at Apple years ago in Apple Retail. I am shocked the people there thought this was the right approach to take. I love Apple products, but this is making me rethink the Apple ecosystem. I am certainly not buying another pair of AirPods. The environmental impacts of this also irk me. Instead of trying to solve the problem they want me to just throw away my AirPods and buy new ones.If a company has a software issue and pushes the cost of that bug onto the consumer the company is incredibly unlikely to ever solve it. Apple pushed the pain point of their software issue onto the consumer. That&#x27;s a painful experience as a customer. reply thepostman0 3 hours agoparentYou still love apple products?

Choosing products which are worse 99% of the time but where the company is more pleasant to work with in the 1% case where something goes wrong is a tough sell. (Omitted from this discussion is whether Apple products are truly better when they work or not. That&#x27;s a wholly unproductive discussion which comes down to opinion and mattcantstop clearly thinks that they are.) reply HelloNurse 20 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s a completely sensible reason to avoid products that are undependable by design.Many Apple \"engineering\" decisions favor the walled garden over robustness; for example, I am unable to update many important applications on my old work Macintosh because they were installed from the app store using an \"Apple account\", or whatever it&#x27;s called, that cannot be used anymore because the colleague who knew the password has left the company; having a privileged account on the computer isn&#x27;t good enough. reply mort96 2 minutes agorootparentIt is definitely reasonable to avoid Apple products! For both these sorts of reasons and others. I&#x27;m not trying to argue otherwise. However, the claim \"it&#x27;s reasonable to not use Apple products\" is very different from \"using&#x2F;liking Apple products is a sign of Stockholm syndrome\". bryanrasmussen 55 minutes agorootparentprevthere are various programmer types who find the Apple way really onerous and problematic, because they want to control everything, these can be either Windows or Linux since both give you the ability to control and mod your system at very high level.Every example of bad behavior by Apple in relation to their products, customer service etc. connects in the mind with this underlying philosophical difference between how computers should be used, and so the indignant feeling wells up in their brain that Apple users are misled and abused, and if you are misled and abused you must have Stockholm syndrome.This however is just my reading of the phenomenon I have observed quite a lot.Before anyone tells me I&#x27;m an Apple lover, I would say until the M1 I considered all OS&#x27;es equivalent with some various benefits to each, but as long as I have M series Macs I do believe they are very superior (but haven&#x27;t tried recent - this year - non M machine) reply thinkingemote 1 hour agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s more like defence of investment. They have spent tens of thousands of money, time, knowledge on this brands ecosystem of devices and software. It&#x27;s not just airpods it&#x27;s the phone, watch, desktop, laptop, all the software purchased over their lifetime and the identity that goes along with it. In deciding to leave there&#x27;s also future costs of moving to something more free but \"worse\".The pain needs to be way greater than the cost of what they have invested. In a way they are not captors of peoples freedom but bankers who hold people&#x27;s time, effort and money. Even with OP&#x27;s case I can almost guarantee that whilst he might consider moving away from Apple because of his bricked laptop, he won&#x27;t - he will side with his investments. Leaving this ecosystem would also cause psychological pain - its very hard to tell oneself that \"I was wrong\".The genius is that Apple makes good stuff and they know that what they make \"just works\" and it all works great together and people will invest not only money but their very selves in the company. The company is the world biggest tech company for a reason. reply npteljes 24 minutes agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s rather \"pick your poison\".

I sound clearer than some people who are using wired headsets. I&#x27;m actually using a bone-conduction headpiece (Shokz OpenRun, a friend has some from a different manufacturer and he sounds fine too when using them for a phone call) so it might be even more surprising that I sound reasonable.If someone does have a problem with how I sound then they can buy me a decent wired headset, or just stop inviting me to remote meetings that I don&#x27;t want to be in anyway :) reply rjzzleep 51 minutes agorootparentShokz products work surprisingly well and the sound has also gotten a lot better.

I have had a lot of problems with AirPod like headphones and had to try several models before I found ones that don&#x27;t fall off. reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentMaybe you are talking about different things? The normal AirPod has a fixed shape - it either fits your ear canal or it doesn’t. You definitely should try it out before buying it.The AirPods Pro has changeable sizes, so it really shouldn’t fall off anyone’s ear. reply Zanfa 2 hours agorootparentCouldn&#x27;t get my AirPod Pros to stay in with any of the tips I could find. Tried silicone, foam, all shapes and sizes, different amounts of pressure and depth in ear, but nothing worked. They&#x27;d just slowly creep out and eventually drop out, especially if I spoke.Regular 2nd gen AirPods are like glued in though, I could headbang or do handstands and they wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere. Go figure... reply alpaca128 1 hour agorootparentIn my experience the fit can be very dependent on the precise orientation in the ear. When I get it right they almost never fall out, when the angle is off a bit they hold for a few minutes at most. reply cfn 2 hours agorootparentprevI haven&#x27;t tried the AirPods yet and the shops around here (remote Atlantic islands) don&#x27;t have an unboxed pair for me to try. From my experience the Pro models would work fine but the other models will probably fall when I am doing work in the woodshop or doing yard work. I have maybe three or four in ear headphones lying around that didn&#x27;t fit the bill. For some people, that type of headphones don&#x27;t fit. reply wannacboatmovie 3 hours agorootparentprevBut it does.So maybe it isn&#x27;t a perfect product. reply krisoft 1 hour agorootparentprev> That is a bit too harsh, his ears may not be the right size or shape.Correction: his ears have perfectly right size and shape. The thing which might not have the right size and shape is the Airpod. We do not fit ourselves to human made objects, but the other way around. reply alpaca128 1 hour agorootparentprev> you&#x27;re doing something very wrong with your Airpods when many of its users are able to do long walks and runs without them ever budgingIt&#x27;s a product relying on friction fit with a body part that&#x27;s shaped differently on every person, what makes you even consider the individual user is at fault?Also in my experience Airpods require a very precise orientation in the ear to really hold well. If the angle is a bit off they can fall out within 30 seconds, if it&#x27;s exactly right I can listen to music for an hour without any issue. But I can&#x27;t eat or drink in that time as that almost guarantees they&#x27;ll slip out, and lying on my back is also not a good idea apparently.Those things are otherwise really cool devices but this is definitely a problem. I&#x27;ve seen a YouTube review where the guy said he&#x27;s on his third pair by now. reply dzhiurgis 3 hours agorootparentprevWired headphones used to drop much more frequently for me - cables get snagged and headphones yeeted.

They sound great, good noise cancellation, and very comfortable to wear for long periods. I am amazed how short-sighted many of the comments here are. You cannot find a cheap wired headphones with anything close to the overall comfort and quality of Air Pods. reply bigstrat2003 2 hours agorootparentWell, when one product costs 10x as much as the other does, I would expect it to be a nicer product. But for me, it is not even possible for a product to be so much better as to justify that price increase. Headphones have exactly one use case for me: listening to music (or playing a game on a handheld device) when in public, so as not to disturb others. So we&#x27;re talking 1h max of quick and dirty use.

Apple isn&#x27;t known for being cheap. Apple&#x27;s website says they want $170 for \"AirPods (3rd generation) with Lightning Charging Case\" though so I don&#x27;t know what you have to buy to pay $250 for pair when you already have a charger!I also assumed that non-airpods were not an option because most people who have airpods only have them \"because apple\".I mean, airpods aren&#x27;t known for being the best when it comes to sound quality compared to other bluetooth options.

Sonos has an uphill battle convincing people to even think about an option other than AirPods. Some manufacturers will give their support reps tremendous freedom to just send free shit out for positive word of mouth.Apple is in no need of positive word of mouth, and in fact thrives despite a very vocal subset of consumers that are adamantly against anything Apple does (sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly).That is, Sonos has to work to keep you a customer, but plenty of Apple customers will just buy Apple no matter what. reply hnlmorg 3 hours agorootparentprevIn Europe you’d be covered under consumer protection laws.I have no idea how a case like this would play out in the US.

I once got a MacBook issued from work that didn&#x27;t have DEP or any MDM, so I did enroll it in Find My &#x2F; Activation Lock. When I returned it I thought I had removed the lock, but there&#x27;s a bit of a misleading option to remove a device (until it checks in again) from Find My that doesn&#x27;t disable the lock. So work tried to contact me through a colleague, failed, and when I called back they already had the Apple reseller do it for them. reply mrzool 5 hours agoparentprevIt’s not a good thing to lock out users who are clearly and demonstrably the owners of a device. Automated protections are good, but there should be procedures in place to handle cases like these. reply AgentK20 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s great in a world where people are unable to resell devices, but the concept of \"ownership\" is fluid in a world where users can sell their devices. I can think of many scams that could abuse a system where anyone who presents an ID associated with a receipt can claim \"ownership\" of a device and bypass various security measures. Keep in mind, Apple&#x27;s threat vectors range from \"random phone thief\" to \"state level actors\", with equally as varied clientele. reply kelnos 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is that you can&#x27;t permanently disable it.To me, the risk of something like what happened to OP is more concerning than being able to lock a thief out of using&#x2F;reselling my laptop. So I&#x27;d prefer to just disable Activation Lock entirely, and prevent it from ever being enabled. Of course, the ability to do that essentially reduces the theft deterrent somewhat, so Apple wouldn&#x27;t want to implement this ability. reply pjerem 5 hours agorootparentprevStill, Apple chose to keep the keys of Activation Lock although they could have made an autonomous system that they could not disable themselves.By keeping a copy of the keys, they are also getting the responsibility to use them when the owner needs them because if they don’t, it raises serious concerns as to why they keep the keys in first place. reply croes 5 hours agoparentprevYou forgot the part where Apple could unbrick it for the legitimate owner.The software does its job, Apple does not. reply threeseed 5 hours agorootparentApple is doing its job.There is no way for it to accurately determine the legitimate owner.So better to err on the side of caution and assume that if you&#x27;re coming to Apple with an unlock request that it&#x27;s not legitimate. reply benjaminwootton 5 hours agorootparentThey can tie your purchase to a serial number.

IMO, this is what should happen given that Activation Lock is enabled.It&#x27;s a separate question whether the customer should be able to disable Activation Lock before it gets tripped, which would prevent the computer from bricking itself. Apple makes that choice for the customer because they don&#x27;t fully respect your ownership of the device that they made. reply ZekeSulastin 4 hours agorootparentprevApple hasn’t yet figured out how to stop people from selling their used equipment. reply oneeyedpigeon 18 minutes agorootparentWell, they have Touch ID on Macbooks now and Face ID is coming soon.

The external case returned to you would be the same. reply coder543 5 hours agorootparentprevI think your second theory about how Activation Lock turned on is the most likely. My understanding is that if Find My wasn&#x27;t active, then Activation Lock also wasn&#x27;t enabled. The person who incorrectly received the laptop probably wiped it and set it up under their personal account, activating Find My + Activation Lock.If the laptop had originally had Activation Lock enabled, the unintended recipient would not have been able to do this, and as a bonus, the location of the laptop would have been trackable.So, I don&#x27;t think they had to swap the laptop out for another Activation Locked laptop... they probably locked it themselves, whether intentionally or not. reply peyton 5 hours agorootparentAnd entered an incorrect password 90 times? reply coder543 5 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s relevant; there are many ways bad passwords could have been entered. We have no way to know the package wasn&#x27;t tampered with during shipping. The unintended recipient could have handed it off to a friend to handle the shipping back to the original owner, and that friend could have been bored. Whoever levied the import duties could have also opened the package and been bored enough to start typing in random passwords, before repacking it and shipping it onwards.Where did \"90 times\" even come from?

I’m saying OP could confirm explicitly by turning the device upside down (and looking near the regulatory markings) and pulling the receipt up.

If you harvest an lcd from a dead&#x2F;locked unit there is no way to access the tool and recalibrate the backlight, so the artifacting remains forever.Swapping the logic board can also cause this issue. Additionally Touch ID is paired to the logic board so if you change one without the other that won’t work anymore.Not sure if there are other paired parts or limitations like that, I’ve only done 2 of the lcd repairs and have only read about the Touch ID pairing (which isn’t a surprise) reply CrendKing 6 hours agoparentprevWhat stops them from just keeping the laptop altogether?

Technically it could be adapted for other fretted instruments with a few lines, because it actually generates the chords mathematically with the help of the excellent Teoria library.This sometimes leads to questionable finger positions, but you can tap any chord diagram to see if there are alternative fingerings, which makes it easy to find the most comfortable way to transition between chords.On a similar note, you can transpose the song until you find a key that avoids the most difficult chords.At one point I considered automating this process by creating a simple heuristic to determine the “difficulty” of a chord fingering, but I decided this was too subjective and varies a lot depending on the adjacent chords and frequency of switching finger positions.Needless to say, I never really learned to play ukulele… reply porkloin 4 hours agoparentGreat work!

Applications include binary patching, converting between object file formats, making software ports and libraries from a binary artifact without source code, decompilation projects...I&#x27;ve been tinkering with it for the past 16 months or so and it&#x27;s the third, hopefully industrial-grade prototype. Right now it can delink 32-bit MIPS and i386 programs from the 1990s or so to ELF object files, as long as it contains basic relocation types.It&#x27;s half-baked because while it works, it doesn&#x27;t support modern instruction sets, advanced relocation types for TLS&#x2F;PLT&#x2F;GOT or exporting to other object file formats besides ELF, so it&#x27;s not that useful on modern artifacts (which is what I assume most reverse-engineers would care about). It&#x27;s not really ready for prime time because I&#x27;m not done writing blog posts that walk through real-world applications and case studies ; there&#x27;s very little literature out there on this esoteric topic and it can be very confusing. Like \"let&#x27;s take this PlayStation PS-EXE file that was built with a COFF toolchain back in the 90s and make MIPS ELF object files out of it that work with modern Linux toolchains\" kind of confusing.I started this project because I wanted to decompile a PlayStation video game and quickly realized that I&#x27;d never get anywhere without a means to divide and conquer it into smaller, more manageable pieces. Ironically the decompilation project itself hasn&#x27;t advanced much, but I&#x27;m having fun so far working on this ; if anything, it shows that ABIs and file formats are but mere conventions that can be arm-twisted into submission given enough leverage. reply dwaltrip 5 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;fracvizzy.com&#x2F;Explorer and visualizer for the Mandelbrot fractal.You can customize the colors &#x2F; style (lots more I want to do with this).

In four months, three packages were returned and three others were almost returned, most from different parties. Apparently this was due to a systematic error. I did everything in my power to get them to fix it, but to no avail. They did not want to even acknowledge the issues exist. Everything was my fault.I found some companions in this misfortune in the Facebook group Suomen Posti - Paska laitos (engl. Finland Post - Shitty Facility). The group had over 20k members that really hate Finland Post Corporation.After reading experiences in this group, and thinking about my own experience, I started thinking that maybe it is possible to classify organizations based on how irredeemable their \"turdness\" is:Level 1: Core process failsLevel 2: Even backup process failsLevel 3: Failed to monitor successLevel 4: Customer service fails to help in case of failureLevel 5: Escalation via customer service fails to helpLevel 6: Executive escalation fails to helpLevel 7: Filing an external complaint to overseeing organization fails to helpIdea of the site is that people can vent their frustrations about an organization, and we can collectively collect systematic data of the turdness level of that organization. This could then potentially help the organization to see and overcome their turdness.It would be great to work with somebody to finalize it and get it running in production.

I figured I should get things working well in one browser first before looking into porting, but consider it on the near term todo list. reply 90-00-09 9 hours agorootparentSounds good. One problem that you will likely encounter in FF is that you can&#x27;t open the native extension popup (the one that is attached to the action button) programmatically. That severely limits how you can present your UI, with the most obvious choice being injecting an iframe with the extension UI directly into the body of the page. The other choice is opening a new popup window, which is less convenient than seeing things side by side. reply djbusby 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is a cross browser extension helper in this thread.

If this sounds stupid, I would offer Hacker News as a working example of this model.My other motivation was that the majority of platforms operate on a popular vote strategy, as a result, content that appeals to our lesser nature tends to do very well. YouTube, for example, could not support the development of content as ambitious as Avatar.Content on Zohing is ranked using a \"recursive voting\" strategy. It attempts to find accounts that have been deemed by other users to be \"high quality\" and weight their interactions more.Put simply: On the spectrum of Avatar to TLC I want creators to aim for Avatar. I am try to create a platform whose underlying game incentivizes the creation of difficult, high effort content instead of reality TV and cable news.Zohing was created to function as a mobile web app. Getting it to work smoothly on iOS safari was a real challenge.

    "originBody": "Ruoyu Sun's Thoughts on design, code and gamedev Home Archive About Feed One Game, By One Man, On Six Platforms: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly 12 Oct 2023 Recently, Valve announced that Counter-Strike 2 would no longer support macOS. As a one-man indie developer who has released a game supporting macOS, I find myself at first surprised at Valve’s decision. But after looking back at my own journey of supporting six platforms, I feel I can understand Valve’s perspective. I feel it is beneficial to write down some of my “lessons learned”, hopefully, that will help fellow indie developers choose which platforms to support. A bit of background, my own game Industry Idle is mostly built on web technologies (WebGL + TypeScript). This means supporting different platforms is comparatively easy - I don’t have to deal with platform-specific graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal) and I mostly live inside the browser sandbox. This is pretty much the sunny day scenario when it comes to cross-platform support. Yet, I am constantly surprised and plagued by platform-specific issues. Web The Good If I am asked to choose a “first-class” platform for Industry Idle, it would be the web. During development, I am running the game in my web browser. So supporting the web is pretty much “automatic”. The platform itself does not need much hassle: I can easily set up an automated build pipeline that deploys to Github/CloudFlare pages, which is mostly free. The Bad As a platform to release a game, the web platform is very saturated. There are a few portal websites left but they are geared towards a very casual audience, who would not play a hard-core factory builder and economy simulation game. The web version makes very little money. If Industry Idle is written without web-first support, I would probably not port the game to the web at all. The Ugly It is very easy to cheat on the web - after all, the nice development and debug tooling that I enjoy also makes cheating very easy. I have to implement a login system (I implemented Steam OpenID login) so that I can ban bad actors - the game has a multiplayer player trade system and a cheater can easily ruin the experience for everyone. Also, it is possible that people will “steal” the game and host it on their website. I am not really bothered by this as long as people playing on those websites do not cheat. TL;DR: Not much work to support but not many players to gain Windows (Steam) The Good Steam is the only storefront where the game is released. I’ve submitted to Epic Game Store as well but never gotten any reply - maybe it is a good thing as integrating another SDK is probably not worth it. In 2023, Windows is still the dominating platform for gamers. About 99% of all desktop players play on Windows. The platform has a relatively stable API - Microsoft almost never breaks backward compatibilities. Setting up an automated build pipeline is relatively easy - I build the Windows version on my Linux server. The Bad The game uses Electron as the runtime. But in order to integrate with Steam SDK (which is in C++), I have used a few solutions: greenworks (no longer maintained), Node-API (via node-addon-api, requires setting up a cross-platform C++ toolchain and write bindings manually), Koffi (an FFI module for Node.JS, provides precompiled binaries but requires writing bindings manually) and finally steamworks.js (calling Steamworks via Rust bindings). The Ugly There are relatively few problems compared to the number of players but occasionally I have to deal with really obscure issues like an old Visual C++ Redistributable installed or a “trimmed” version of Windows missing some DLLs. And a lot of Windows players are not tech-savvy, which makes debugging hard. But I cannot really complain about it - looking at the percentage of people who have encountered platform-specific issues, Windows is probably the lowest among desktops. TL;DR: Not supporting Windows is not an option but luckily it’s relatively easy macOS (Steam) The Good When I wrote the first line of code of Industry Idle, I was using a Mac. I’ve been a long-time Mac user and have only migrated to Windows after doing more game dev. Mac accounts for less than 1% of all desktop players but oftentimes people are pleasantly surprised that the game works on Mac and I’ve got several “thank-you” emails about it. Another good thing about the platform is that the x64 build more or less “just works” on Apple Silicon Macs - I don’t have an Apple Silicon Mac and the game only has an x64 build but several “thank-you” emails I’ve got are from Apple Silicon Mac owners - I guess they should really thank Rosetta. Running in emulation mode is not really ideal but the game runs on a potato so the powerful Apple Silicon can easily handle it even with emulation overhead. The Bad Mac is one of the most problematic platforms, even after Electron handles most of the platform-specifics, there are lots of gotchas: Code signing with a hardened runtime is almost a must. However, Steamworks SDK loads dylib, which requires several entitlement exceptions. It’s not well-documented so good luck figuring out which ones. And fingers crossed that Apple will not one day disallow those exceptions. After signing the executable, I need to notarize it. The old notarization API takes forever (for a 200MB executable, anywhere between 30 minutes to several hours), fails randomly, and almost never gives meaningful error messages. The new “notarytool” is much improved, but still adds 10mins to the build pipeline. In comparison, the total “Windows + Linux + macOS + upload to Steam” pipeline without code signing and notarization takes about 2-3 minutes. Of course, the above has to be done on a Mac (some limited experimental non-Mac support starts to become available), which is notoriously bad for build automation. I have a bunch of hacks like security unlock-keychain in the build script but it still fails occasionally. And, keep in mind, this is the sunny day scenario: no platform-specific API porting is needed (like from DirectX/Vulkan to Metal). The Ugly The economy of supporting Mac as an indie is bleak. A Mac is pretty much needed and they are not cheap. All the revenue from the platform does not even cover 10% of the cheapest Mac Mini. And then there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee for notarization. Luckily it can be used for iOS as well. Also, Apple is more willing to break backward compatibilities. Sometimes there are new macOS/XCode version requirements, which means upgrading the operating system (takes 1-2 hours, can occasionally fail) and XCode (takes 2+ hours, I usually just leave it overnight). TL;DR: Not worth the time and money and definitely not worth the pain Linux (Including Steam Deck) The Good Linux is not picky about hardware - it runs on everything and costs nothing. I run Arch Linux inside a virtual machine on my development machine to test the game. I also run Ubuntu on my build machine to produce the executables. And the server runs on a VPS that runs Debian. Linux is very easy to automate. The Bad Linux is very saturated and the operating systems come in different shapes and forms. Initially, I struggled to get the game running at all. In fact, even an empty Electron app (from the official example) does not run. And after hours of Googling, adding --no-sandbox argument solves for some users but not for all. This is kind of expected because it is impossible to know what libraries are installed on the OS and which version. I wish Steam would allow me to say “Linux support is provided at a best-effort basis” but that’s not an option - I have to tick the checkbox to provide the Linux build, which sometimes sets the wrong expectation. After Steam Deck was released, I thought supporting it would be automatic - after all, I have a Linux build - but no. It turns out that unless the game is explicitly marked (by Valve reviewers), Steam Deck will use the Windows build + Proton even if a Linux version is available. And the Linux version is running against “Steam Runtime” - a relatively fixed set of libraries that developers can target. It is a good solution to the saturated Linux library situation but unfortunately, several libraries are missing to run Electron. To give Valve credit, they are very responsive and helpful in eventually resolving the issue. The Ugly Linux accounts for less than 1% of the total players, so from a business perspective, it is not worth it. And the platform has the highest percentage of players who run into platform-specific issues - the time used for customer support only makes the economy worse. Also, I don’t own a Steam Deck, so adding support is not always easy: Valve does not provide a SteamOS image to test. So Steam Deck-specific code (like controller support, starting the game in full-screen, making the UI bigger, etc) is not tested end-to-end. I’ve used HoloISO with limited success. TL;DR: Even worse economy than Mac but less annoyance perhaps iOS The Good Industry Idle’s core engine is actually a mobile engine - before Industry Idle, I was mainly making mobile games. However, Industry Idle is a desktop-first game, which means porting to mobile requires quite some UI adjustments. The game runs inside a custom WkWebView on iOS, with some bridging code that exposes native APIs (like Game Center). iOS hardware and software are generally less saturated compared to Android, which means after testing the game on my aging iPhone 6, I have high confidence that the game will work fine on most other iOS devices. The base game of Industry Idle is free-to-play, with two Expansion Packs available for purchase (one-time purchase, not subscriptions) - the same as Steam. There’s only one optional “reward video” ad that allows a player to double the offline income by watching an ad. The game has no microtransactions - I don’t like mobile games that are full of ads or are very pushy about microtransactions. iOS is generally a more “premium” mobile platform compared to Android, which means more players have purchased expansion packs compared to Android. Even though iOS accounts for only about 30% of all mobile players. it brings in about 50% of all mobile income. Also a nice side-effect of Apple’s walled garden is that iOS has the lowest percentage of cheaters. I know there have been lots of complaints about App Review on iOS. I feel the situation has been much improved. Review time is relatively short (1-2 days) and if a reviewer rejects an update for nonsensical grounds, a quick reply usually solves the problem. For example, once an update was rejected for missing a “Restore Purchase” button. I replied by telling the reviewer where to find the button with a screenshot and also gently pointing out the fact that that button had been there since the initial release, which was more than 50 releases ago. The update was approved the next day. During the initial release, the game was rejected for “copying an existing game”. It turned out the AppStore reviewer believed I was “pirating” the Steam version of Industry Idle. I ended up putting a secret web page on the official website, telling the reviewer that I was indeed the developer behind the Steam version. The release was timely approved. The fact that AppStore has human reviewers is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people make mistakes, which causes unnecessary annoyances. On the other hand, it’s easy to talk to an actual human and resolve any issues. Compared to Google Play, which is very machine-driven and is very hard to find a human for solutions. The Bad WkWebView is the only allowed web view on iOS and its update is coupled with the iOS update. Apple stopped supporting the iPhone 6 a while ago, which means it is stuck with iOS 12 and a relatively ancient WkWebView. Luckily most players use a much newer iPhone, which helps with this problem. Similar to developing for macOS, a Mac is pretty much required for developing for iOS and there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee. I think the combined income of both iOS and macOS (95% of which comes from iOS) barely covers the cost of the membership fee and the cheapest Mac Mini. And presumably an iPhone is needed for testing, which means the game would be running at a loss. Luckily I had my old Macbook and iPhone so I didn’t have to spend that money. Just like macOS, iOS is not really designed for build automation either. Partially because I have to run it on a Mac, and partially because the automation pipeline is flaky. Fastlane is a tremendous time saver, however, the build will occasionally fail (2FA required or Apple Server down) and require manual intervention. Because of this, I don’t produce iOS or macOS beta builds. The Ugly Mobile is generally a very different platform compared to desktop. Even though it has a very large audience, reaching the target audience usually requires paid user acquisition (i.e. spending money to buy ads). I have zero marketing budget: a lot of players learn about the game on other platforms; a lot of players join via their friends (word of mouth); and there was once a spike in downloads which I could only imagine was from AppStore Editorial or algorithm. Since I was never told anything about this, I could not confirm it. The lack of annoying ads and pushy microtransactions provide a good experience on mobile. However, this means the mobile income is abysmal: it’s a fraction of desktop versions, even though the player amount is much higher. TL;DR: 50% of supporting mobile is supporting iOS Android The Good Android version uses the built-in WebView and Google has been doing a decent job of keeping it up-to-date. Since it is not tied to the OS update, a bigger percentage of players on Android have a relatively recent version. However, the same cannot be said about the operating system itself and hardware, which I will get to later. Android’s automated build pipeline (powered by Fastlane) is much faster and more stable - it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and the command line has first-class support. Android devices are generally cheaper to acquire - I use Android as my daily phone so extra saving for me! As mentioned before, Google Play uses lots of machine-based checks, which means update review is generally faster (a few hours) if everything goes well. The Bad Android OS and hardware is a mess! There are lots of different hardware, each can run a different OS version, which can have weird customizations from manufacturers. WebView is in general okay but native APIs are very messy - the same API can behave very differently on different devices (e.g. when display cutout API was first introduced, the adoption was bad and each manufacturer has its own quirkiness). My strategy is simple: I test on my own phone and cross my fingers hoping it will work on other devices. Also Android has a relatively aggressive API deprecation strategy. Google Play requires a relatively recent targetSdkVersion and would reject an app update if one of the third-party SDKs is deprecated. This means I have to constantly fire up Android Studio and update Android and SDK versions (sometimes Kotlin and Gradle versions as well). The project usually will fail to compile, which means several hours of fixing and testing. This does not happen every day but often enough to be annoying. In comparison, I only have to open XCode and update the native Swift code maybe twice since the initial release. The Ugly Android accounts for 70% of all mobile players but the revenue is about the same as iOS. Few people have purchased the expansion packs and most income actually comes from the one and only optional reward video ad. Actually, the ad implementation on Android is probably buggy since it oftentimes does not show up after backgrounding the game until a hard restart - I have got complaints from users about this! However, I never managed to figure out why - partially because I couldn’t reproduce it on my phone and partially because I’d like to spend my time working on the game, not debugging some buggy Ad SDK. TL;DR: The other 50% of supporting mobile is supporting Android Conclusion I appreciate that you’ve read through my long rant about platform support as a one-man indie and hopefully, this will help you in your decision-making - I know I will definitely make better choices for my next game. When talking about game development, the boring details above are rarely mentioned, yet they are of vital importance in actually shipping a game and they can take a lot of effort. In fact, apart from doing platform support work, most of my time is spent on customer support, community management, reviewing and banning cheaters, and server maintenance. So much so that the work on my new game is severely delayed. I’ve yet to find a good balance but I am trying my best.

For decades, I always hopelessly thought the OS and hardware gaps would eventually be bridged by something like Qt or SDL or wxWidgets, and we&#x27;d all one day be happily programming cross platform apps using plain old native languages and SDKs instead of Electron or the HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS triad of pain. As the years go on, and OS vendors move even more towards their own proprietary incompatible native APIs, this dream seems less and less likely. reply swatcoder 12 hours agoparentPlatform innovation requires control over your own API, because you want to expose the features and architectures that make your platform excel and that weren’t accounted for in abstracted tools. There will always be incompatible native API’s.Meanwhile, a ton of apps and games are completely agnostic to those cutting edge platform differences and are going to thrive in least common denominator sandboxes. And making those sandboxes easy to use for some specific style&#x2F;genre&#x2F;skill-level is always going to be the competitive difference between them. So the big high-level things are always going to exist too.But… so are the near-metal abstractions that let you cut through and interleave cross-platform and platform-specific code even in high-performance paths.You wanted the last group to “win”, but the ecosystem inevitably involves all three.

It’s the story they tell you of course, but I think that’s a marketing lie.Let’s be clear first that hardware is the platform. Your comment seems to agree with that. Note that for quite a long time, the Windows and Mac world used the same hardware (same CPU, same GPU), and therefore the same platform. They could have went together and specified a common API to work on both MacOS and Windows, and they could both expose all the hardware has to offer. Heck, if they really wanted to expose all the goodness hardware has to offer, they would give us the actual data sheets. They don’t, for various reasons that are generally tied to \"IP\".They tell us sweet words about innovation, but let’s be honest they just want to lock us in. reply andybak 4 minutes agorootparentBoth things can be true. reply livrem 3 hours agoparentprevEven without the time traveling, I would be happy if there was just a single stable, non-bloated, reliable, portable platform that could be used for when you just want to Write Once and then know that it will Run Everywhere _forever_ (* insert disclaimer about nothing literally lasting forever).

It&#x27;s their complete security failure, still continuing today, that forces everyone to the web.The other, slightly less important thing is petty rejection of cross-platform APIs (e.g. Apple&#x27;s refusal to allow Vulkan support in macOS). It&#x27;s fine to additionally have platform-specific APIs, but there should be a least common denominator cross-platform standard. But middleware can smooth over this problem, while the security problem is something only OS vendors could fix.Unfortunately, the position of gatekeeper turned out to be so profitable that vendors don&#x27;t actually want to improve their security to the point where it&#x27;s unnecessary. And they&#x27;re also incentivized to prevent the web from improving to the point where it would threaten their gatekeeper status. reply ugh123 10 hours agoparentprevElectron would be great if it weren&#x27;t for the performance, security, configuration, and packaging issues.

Aside: the worst situation is when publishing on itch.io and playing on an iPad--your data appears to get saved to Local Storage but is actually wiped immediately to prevent cross-site tracking (itch.io hosts HTML5 games in a frame with a different domain).Publishing on Steam, on the other hand, gives you durable file system storage and you can add cross-device syncing via Steam Cloud very easily.

Dutch parliament had earlier passed two motions calling on the Dutch government not to support this proposal, but our government has declared it will ignore those motions. This hearing was timely because next week, or even this Friday, EU member states vote on how to proceed with this terrible proposal (Lawfare review from a US perspective). I’ve translated my introduction in the Dutch parliamentary hearing because I think it might add a little bit to the debate, and also because it sheds a light on the poor state of Dutch democracy, and some sunlight might help. More context on this proposed EU law can be found, in Dutch, in a post I wrote earlier. Automated translation will likely do a decent job on this. Or follow Patrick Breyer’s explanation here. He’s been on the case for years now. Transcript (machine transcribed, machine translated, lightly edited, a few sentences added for international context): I have been involved in this subject for about fifteen years now. I once supplied software to the Dutch police for investigations into CSAM. I was also a regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security agencies, so I know a bit about proportionality and subsidiarity and law. For a long time I’ve also been on occasional talks between industry and government about how child pornography can be combated or made more difficult. So the subject is very familiar to me. It’s also about AI, because the AI will have to scan our communications. I have also written a small book about AI and a training course. So I hope I know a little bit about it. And in contrast to my esteemed, highly educated predecessors, I will perhaps talk about the subject in very plain language. [Holds up QR code] I want to show this to the viewers at home for a moment. You can find my position paper here. This worked very well last time I presented here. And the QR code is perhaps good to keep in mind how many feelings this aroused among people around the corona crisis. What we are talking about now is that in all our WhatsApp groups, our Signal groups, our Telegram groups, a new participant will join the conversation, namely an EU logo. And all the photos we put there, all the videos we put there, are scanned by a computer. And that computer first has a list of known bad material. But the EU proposal also says that we should also have AI and it should say, “Oops, that child photo is the wrong kind of child photo.” In addition, the law is quite general about it, says the AI should detect the “approaching of children”. Well, that’s a very broad term, but they mean grooming. And if the system sees one of those things, then there will be a report to an EU official. And this person gets reports all day long, “Is this CSAM or not?”. And only if the material is evidently incorrect, no action will be taken. So if the photo is of a toaster, and not a child, that is the end of it. But in almost all other cases, the process continues. Then the material goes to two places. It goes to a local authority that will do research there. And the law actually doesn’t say much about what happens then. And that is crucial. Because we often say “Think about the children.” Let’s do that too. But there is a fantastic stream of reports from this system. Because it is still very difficult to determine the nature of a photo. For example, the Dutch Forensic Institute has said, “We are not going to look at a photo and say whether this is a minor or not.” The NFI has said, “We can’t do that. It doesn’t work. We need X-rays. We just can’t.” But the European Union has said, “Our computer can do that.” This leads to a a fantastic stream of “Maybe it’s wrong, maybe it’s not wrong” material. And it is then passed on to a local police station or an authority that will look at it. They might start an investigation. And the first thing a citizen notices is that they receive a letter from the police. At such and such time, the EU has found that you have shared a photo that we unfortunately cannot include here. Because it is possibly CSAM, so we cannot show you. But at 5.34 p.m. we have found a photo that was not good and we started an investigation. I just said, “Think of the children.” And we really have to do that. And we want to make their lives better. But their lives will not get any better if this system starts a huge stream of unjust investigations. “When we found five justifiable investigations, how many unjust investigations have we launched. Did we make it worse?” Because an unjust investigation into someone can end up terribly bad. Especially if the person under investigation is not perfect. And many people think, “It’s not that bad to be investigated, because then I go to the police station and I just explain it, I explain that my own child was in the bath and so on.” You can really forget that illusion. At the moment the investigation starts, you have nothing more you can “just explain”. But you are in all kinds of databases. And I want to come back to that. The people at Europol have already said, “We are going to keep that database.” Including all the things that turned out to be unjust. Because they said, “Who knows? Maybe we can do something with it.” And that brings me to my second topic here. This is not a law that needs to be tuned a little bit and then it is good. This has never happened before. In my old work, when I had to regulate the AIVD and the MIVD [Dutch Intelligence, Security and SIGINT agencies], we were asked individually whether we could listen to these ten people or not. And then we held a meeting about it with two wise people and me. And now we are talking about 500 million Europeans, and saying, “Let’s just apply those scanners!” That is incredible. This is not something… If we approve this as a country, if we as the Netherlands vote in favour of this in Europe and say, “Do it,” we will cross a threshold that we have never crossed before. Namely, every European must be monitored with a computer program, with a technology… With a technology of which the vast, overwhelming majority of scientists have said, “It is not finished.” I mentioned earlier the example that the Dutch National Forensic Institute says, “We cannot do this by hand.” The EU has now said, “Our computer can do that.” 420 scientists have signed a petition saying, “We know this technology, some of us invented it, we just can’t do it.” We can’t even make a reliable spam filter. Making a spam filter is exactly the same technology, by the way, but then much easier. It just doesn’t work that well, but the consequences aren’t that scary for a spam filter. Nevertheless, there are now MPs who say, “Well, I feel this is going to work. I have confidence in this.” While the scientists, including the real scientists who came here tonight, say, “Well, we don’t see how this could work well enough”. And then government then says, “Let’s start this experiment with those 500 million Europeans.” WhatsApp and Telegram - well, Telegram is not going to implement this law, but WhatsApp will. They will not hesitate to announce this to all their users with a large EU logo. “Pay attention, the EU is watching you. We have installed software on your phone, on behalf of the government that will keep an eye on you.” And I don’t think that is going to go down very well. Also, if we want to learn how to implement such scanning technology, if we want to learn internationally how to do this, there is only one country in the world that can help us. And that is China. And I don’t know if that’s such a good prospect. Thank you.

They use it as a justification, because it works.Of course CSAM is bad, shouldn’t we do everything in our power to prevent it? If you implement client-side scanning, you will catch some rookies. Some old pervs that don’t know how to use encryption manually, or use Matrix. They will use them to show how effective the system is…with the exception that it doesn’t work against anyone who knows anything about computers. And I think the regulators know it, they aren’t dumb (imo). It’s, like I said earlier, an excuse to expand the scope of scanning later. reply SgtBaker 15 hours agoparentYes, it&#x27;s already begun, even though the directive isn&#x27;t even ratified yet: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;balkaninsight.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;europol-sought-unlimite...Europol wants unfettered, unfiltered access to all scanned data, regardless if there&#x27;s a crime or not.And they want to inject all of that into their Police AI (which they also want unregulated).It&#x27;s going to be awesome future. reply nullfield 15 hours agorootparentAnd of course in the released minutes the details of which idiot made which claim are redacted.So much for the transparency and accountability they’ll no doubt promise will be there for the process of accusations (not that this makes the idea any better, useful, or more palatable), which need not apply to themselves. reply lock-the-spock 13 hours agorootparentThis is standard acces to document request protocol across Europe. You are not going to make your staff targets of the internet mob (see Trump and the names of jurors). You can deduce these were likely actually low level staff (contrary to what the article claims) as names of actual high level staff would normally not be blacked out, although I don&#x27;t know Europol, as a police body they might have different safety protocols. reply lock-the-spock 13 hours agorootparentprevSorry this is not quality journalism and you misunderstood the message further.1. The meeting tool place after the commission made it&#x27;s proposal, meaning that contrary to the way the article sets it up, the meeting couldn&#x27;t have shaped the proposal. 2. The screenshot of a meeting report states that Europol wants access to the same info as Member States for specific cases, contrary to your summary it doesn&#x27;t say anything about access to all data. 3. That police agencies want to include further areas into the legislation is not unusual. That doesn&#x27;t guarantee it will happen, nor does the police body speak for the executive or legislators or represent the EU views as a whole.I do think the proposals go a bit too far, on the other side the whole tech world assumption that anything has to stay lawless is just absurd. No one can deny there is a problem with pedophile material and to say to protect the purity of free speech all such issues have to stay unaddressed is just a position blind to reality. reply wkat4242 7 hours agorootparent> No one can deny there is a problem with pedophile material and to say to protect the purity of free speech all such issues have to stay unaddressed is just a position blind to reality.This is not about free speech at all. Free speech is about the government not censoring public speech and publication. Publishing this kind of material is already an exception of free speech and nobody disagrees with that.This proposal is about the private communication of all citizens. Not only is it a disproportional measure, it&#x27;s also ineffective. It will not reduce the demand for this material and will only stop a particular method of distribution. The bad actors will just move to other methods including non-digital or steganography, on unmonitored or hacked devices. Just like the war on drugs doesn&#x27;t work, they will find a way.But in the meantime this will deeply undermine the privacy of all people and this tooling will inevitably be used for more purposes than originally proposed. As this linked article shows.And in order for this to work it will basically have to make FOSS operating systems illegal because as long as the user can modify their OS they can remove this scan. This is one of the reasons I consider it disproportional. Or if implemented on the messaging side only (which is easier to bypass than in the OS), it will make open messaging apps illegal. reply robertlagrant 13 hours agorootparentprev> on the other side the whole tech world assumption that anything has to stay lawless is just absurdThis is not the whole tech world&#x27;s position. Why make up an equally bad opposing position instead of just saying \"this regulation is going too far\"? reply cudder 15 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s so disheartening to follow these. Time after another we hear about some insane Orwellian plot to exploit our deepest secrets. All spun so that the masses will think it&#x27;s for some noble cause like protecting the children when really it&#x27;s anything but. And it never stops! Tackle one and it&#x27;s back a year later in some even more devious form like a fucking Hydra. I&#x27;m just so tired I wanna move into a cottage in the woods. reply teekert 6 minutes agoparentprevI very much agree, plus:Are they thinking of the children when they raid dad&#x27;s home because a picture of a kids genitals went to a physician for tele-medicine?Are they thinking of the kids when they come for dad when dad really doesn&#x27;t like his pictures scanned and self-hosts his infra and uses a Linux based phone? reply akira2501 14 hours agoparentprev> shouldn’t we do everything in our power to prevent it?I&#x27;m more concerned about the original abuse. The pictures are obviously an issue as they create a market _for_ abuse, but if you&#x27;re not targeting the original crime, I don&#x27;t think you stand a chance of actually improving the world by destroying rights. reply garba_dlm 15 hours agoparentprevthe solution, regrettably, already in motion, is (obviously) to make sure less people know anything about computers.by these two actions combined this anti-freedom garbage (further consolidating and centralizing powers) will work effectively reply nforgerit 16 hours agoprevStill flabbergasted how effective the lobbying circles around Thorn have been in recent years. I wish no less than this law getting sent to Spam and Ylva Johansson, the accountable EU commissioner, to be forced to step back.The EU legislator Martin Sonneborn, member of the German satirist party \"Die Partei\", is proven he was right when in beginning of the legislature he just enumerated all the criminal and semi-criminal acts of several members of the current EU commission. Led by von der Leyen who also has a horrible track record in German politics. \"Europa nicht den Laien überlassen\"It&#x27;s actually not funny anymore because those people are destroying everything. reply anfogoat 15 hours agoparentNow now, millionaires need hobbies too. They can&#x27;t swing for the outer edges of the atmosphere so decimating privacy on the Internet will have to do I guess. Ashton&#x27;s urge to protect the children apparently trumps the privacy of 450 million EU citizens and you would think he&#x27;d be able to extend some of that zeal to adult victims of abuse as well but going by his letter to the jury on behalf of Danny Masterson, you&#x27;d be wrong.From my understanding, Johansson is also the Commissioner who, after it coming to light that the Europol had had a little too much fun mass collecting data and gleefully violating EU citizens&#x27; privacy rights, stepped into action that resulted in an effort to pass a new law that retroactively made everything the Europol did legal. reply rngname22 14 hours agoparentprev> enumerated all the criminal and semi-criminal acts of several members of the current EU commissionany chance anyone can link or give some suggestions of search terms to try to find this? reply nforgerit 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s all I can give you right now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cc-elFcs96YIt&#x27;s the 1,5min speech where Sonneborn enumerated some cases, unfortunately in German. AFAIR when he held it, I researched a couple of names and issues he mentioned that didn&#x27;t look too polemic. In general, he (and his team) is doing what I&#x27;d call \"trustworthy research\" packed up into satire. reply londons_explore 17 hours agoprevI want to see a mockup of the UI that Whatsapp will show for this...I want to see some quick animation that shows each image sent being inspected for nudity, children, weapons, and a list of other things. I want to see the probability of each item shown to the user. I want the decision thresholds to be shown, and the animation showing the rest of what will happen to them if the threshold is exceeded (ie. \"Report to police\", \"fired from job\", \"Judge\", \"Prison\").If whatsapp manage to manage to convey all that in a 3 second animation whenever an image is sent, I think users will baulk and the law will be removed. reply orangepurple 13 hours agoparentIn the future sending a WhatsApp text message such as \"I stand with Palestine\" will have the police knocking at your door with an arrest warrant in hand. I think Germany or the UK will be the first places to implement it. The spirit of the Gestapo and Stasi lives on. reply JoshGlazebrook 17 hours agoprevNot specific to this, but can we just rename the \"European Union\" to \"Big Government\" at this point? It feels like every month there is something else the EU is trying to be a nanny for and it is starting to feel like they&#x27;re moving towards becoming something in the vein of what China does to their citizens and internet. reply sigmoid10 16 hours agoparentThe EU is nothing like China. China is basically a dictatorship, run by a single party, with a single guy on top who can make far reaching decisions. The EU is a huge collection of institutions and political parties. Even if they agree on something in the parliament and the commission, they still need all the heads of government - from every single member country - to agree before it becomes law. And even if they manage to do that, political activists can and have brought down laws using the European court of justice. These spy laws under the guise of protecting children from sexual abuse from zealot parties have come and gone for many years now, but functioning democracies like the EU have never seen them come to fruition. reply nonethewiser 13 hours agorootparentThe key difference is the EU doesnt have as much enforcement ability because they are not a dictatorship and the people they are governing have higher expectations. None of which is really a credit to the EU. reply sigmoid10 8 hours agorootparentThe point was that these ideas are neither new nor rare. They constantly pop up everywhere. But only a functioning democracy can keep them at bay. Like it or not, it is the only thing that can protect you from mad&#x2F;powerhungry people&#x27;s ideas. reply anigbrowl 16 hours agoparentprevThis is a fallacy of composition. A hearing to evaluate one proposal in one country is not &#x27;The EU is doing a thing&#x27;, any more than a hearing in a US state legislature or even in Congress is equivalent to a law being passed.The thing is the Tech community doesn&#x27;t have a clear and simple response to CSAM, although CSAM has proliferated with the growth of the internet. Nobody cares about the technical excuses; people care about the absence of any clear effort to reduce its availability and spread. Absent technical measures, people will continue to demand legislative ones. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparent> The thing is the Tech community doesn&#x27;t have a clear and simple response to CSAMThe Automotive community doesn&#x27;t have a clear and simple response to bank robbery. Nor are they expected to, because they are not a law enforcement agency. reply anigbrowl 11 hours agorootparentI have never heard anyone blame automative manufactures for the use of getaway cars, nor have I ever heard anyone in that industry vocally minimizing the problem of vehicular crime to avoid some commercial inconvenience.

Yet we have people trying to get tech corporations to act in the role of law enforcement, which they ought not to be doing and certainly ought not be to required to by law.> nor have I ever heard anyone in that industry vocally minimizing the problem of vehicular crime to avoid some commercial inconvenience.If you have people demanding that all cars come with government tracking devices under the pretext they could be used in bank robberies and someone in the auto industry notices that bank robberies aren&#x27;t actually all that common, what should they do? Pretend it to be otherwise?This is not a matter of commercial inconvenience. The economic cost of writing or installing the code is not the issue. The issue is that this is totalitarianism which once installed would not be limited to enforcing laws against child abuse. One of the reasons privacy is a human right is to protect the public against abuses of the state. It doesn&#x27;t cease to be a right because the state finds it inconvenient -- the state is meant to find it inconvenient. reply nonethewiser 12 hours agorootparentprevYour point is spot on, but I fully expect this to change when (if) self driving cars happen. I see absolutely no chance that automakers arent forced to create government mandated overrides for police or whomever. In fact I think it’s plausible that self driving cars are not allowed on the road without centralized control from the very beginning. Not as some exception, but as a primary feature for controlling traffic as a whole. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a single point of failure. The centralized system goes down and your whole country&#x27;s transportation system is dead. Politicians may want that but it&#x27;s an extraordinarily bad idea and it&#x27;s possible that there are enough people who understand that in e.g. the military with the political influence to prevent it.It also kind of defeats the entire concept of self-driving cars, which is that they can work without that. They have to be able to work in places with bad wireless reception or a power outage in the traffic control system, not only because of the single point of failure but because things like that could happen while the vehicle is in motion.Meanwhile there is no legitimate reason to make them mandatory because people already have the incentive to use a system that provides quicker routes. There is no law requiring people to use Waze, but they do. reply f33d5173 13 hours agorootparentprev> The Automotive community doesn&#x27;t have a clear and simple response to bank robbery. Nor are they expected to, because they are not a law enforcement agency.Measures against auto theft are well established to have brought down incidence of robbery, because it makes it harder to get a getaway car. And the auto industry has absolutely been given the responsibility of overseeing that. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparent> Measures against auto theft are well established to have brought down incidence of robbery, because it makes it harder to get a getaway car.Measures against theft are driven by the market because car buyers don&#x27;t want their cars to be stolen. Some incidental effect on getaway cars is nothing they had an obligation to provide.And it&#x27;s questionable whether that is even true, because anyone could just steal an older car or different make with no such anti-theft features, or use their own car and steal someone else&#x27;s license plate. reply ok_dad 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe every car should have a tracker, camera, and audio mic feeding back to the police, just in case someone in some car somewhere is driving drunk and talking about it. Then we can immediately dispatch an officer. Also, it’ll be easy to track stolen cars right? You might even catch other crimes, so it’s like a win-win-win, right?Does that seem reasonable? If not, then phone scanning probably is not reasonable either. reply jenadine 15 hours agorootparentprev> although CSAM has proliferated with the growth of the internetDo you know if actual child abuse also proliferated? reply nforgerit 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s another absurd point about our public debates: No one cares to share some facts. It feels like it&#x27;s all based on gut feeling and emotions.As far as I know, we don&#x27;t have official numbers (at least not shared as part of the discussion). But what we know is, those scanners have a significantly high error rate and will overwhelm law enforcement with false-positives. What we also know is that law enforcement is simply not competent enough, there was a case in Germany where they just removed links in a Forum forgetting to sweep the according link targets to file hosters. reply anigbrowl 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a different question, isn&#x27;t it? Maybe you should explore it on its own rather than letting it distract from the issue under discussion. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentIt is the issue under discussion. The justification for prohibiting the material is that its production requires child abuse. But copying doesn&#x27;t require additional production. It may have even gone down if dissemination of existing images competes with new production, or wider dissemination makes it easier for law enforcement to obtain the images and use them to track down the producers. Whether or not the amount of abuse increased is then quite relevant. reply anigbrowl 11 hours agorootparentNo, the issue is the proliferation of CSAM. Reducing child abuse in CSAM production is only one of the reasons its prohibited. I find it hard to believe that a long time technology advocate like yourself is unaware of the fact that the circulation of older CSAM continues to hurt people who were abused in its manufacture.Your comment unfortunately exemplifies the problem of tech people trying to define the problem away rather than directly address the harms involved or propose privacy-respecting technical solutions to proactively mitigate it. reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparent> Reducing child abuse in CSAM production is only one of the reasons its prohibited.It is the primary reason that it&#x27;s prohibited, outweighing any other reason by an order of magnitude.> I find it hard to believe that a long time technology advocate like yourself is unaware of the fact that the circulation of older CSAM continues to hurt people who were abused in its manufacture.That depends on how they feel about it. If it is the case that dissemination of existing material reduces the production of new material, no one could be faulted for wanting what they went through to prevent someone else from being forced to go through it too, if at all possible.> Your comment unfortunately exemplifies the problem of tech people trying to define the problem away rather than directly address the harms involved or propose privacy-respecting technical solutions to proactively mitigate it.There isn&#x27;t any known privacy-respecting technical solution and it may not even be possible for one to exist. You can&#x27;t tell if someone&#x27;s secret is unlawful without knowing what it is, but anything with access to all of everyone&#x27;s secrets is inherently a comprehensive violation of everyone&#x27;s privacy. Any technological solution that could be used for this could not be limited to being used for this.Fundamentally what you&#x27;re asking for is the technology to violate everyone&#x27;s privacy, so that you can violate the privacy of child abusers. But the technology doesn&#x27;t care what you use it for. It can&#x27;t be limited to only being used against bad guys. replytick_tock_tick 14 hours agorootparentprevThe difference is ridiculous laws in the EU actually get passed and implemented. reply lock-the-spock 12 hours agorootparentThe EU doesn&#x27;t have a patriot act; the whole body of decades of EU legislation on tech is still less intrusive than that one single act the US has in place and continues to use extensively. Not to mention that US agencies have a long history of acting outside the law, which has no real equivalent in Europe except maybe Russia. There is a reason why police agencies in Europe want more rights, currently they are very curtailed an unable to handle much of digital crime.More generally, the EU has some stupid laws but also plenty of important ones that either bring greater good (safe products in the supermarkets, trade standards, common procurement rules, accountability of what national governments do on economic policy and debt levels, ...) or good for a specific sector (strong data protection and rights for instance, tech standards like usb c, etc). Here the discussion is not even about a law but about a proposal for a law where different people and bodies express different views. EU lawmaking is lengthy and quite transparent so you have these discussions often and at various points in the process, which is unusual compared to many national contexts. And it lends itself to viewing and overstating different views. It doesn&#x27;t help that there are many lobby groups that sound like semi-EU bodies when they are in reality just industry groups of various kinds that make broad demands which are then echoed in the press as some kind of EU positon.I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;ve been led to have such a negative emotional reaction to the EU, but it just doesn&#x27;t mirror the actual facts. reply tick_tock_tick 10 hours agorootparent> Not to mention that US agencies have a long history of acting outside the law, which has no real equivalent in Europe except maybe Russia.> which has no real equivalent in Europe> which has no real equivalent in EuropeWhat a joke, now I know you&#x27;re just trolling or are just that ignorant of history. reply anigbrowl 11 hours agorootparentprevLet me guess, you too are tired of GPDR popups? I love them, being able to opt out of tracking is absolutely worth the interruption. reply olliej 8 hours agorootparentprevThere are lots of things you can do to reduce child abuse, the problem is conservatives hate anything that means sex is not taboo. The result is that they block any kind of meaningful sex ed, and make manipulating and abusing children much easier - manipulating children by telling them people will think they&#x27;re sluts, or their parents will abandon them, or better yet that the victims are responsible are all standard tricks of abusers.Then you get the constant negligible sentences when \"good\" people are found to be pedophiles, the constant victim blaming in courts (apparently \"well look how they were dressed\", \"they were drinking\", etc are still real defenses in the US). Look at the abuse received by people who reported that \"great\" coach in the US, when suddenly sports was more important than child abuse. Then of course you have the constant church coverups that are routinely ruled legal, and then the victims get called scammers.This is before you get to the abuse of children allowed by people who are trying to \"stop their child being LGBT\", which is literally torture, but again 100% ok because the people doing it are the conservatives who fight actual meaningful changes to protect children.Instead what we get is police saying we need to have an unauditable system to report the content of people&#x27;s phones with no warrant. Ignore the immense cost of false accusations, ignore the documented failures of these systems, ignore the incredible scope for abuse by other people (is it CSAM, or is just LGBT content? because plenty of US states and countries consider them equal). Is it reporting to parents? Plenty of child abusers will want to know if their children are looking at anything LGBT related so they have an excuse to abuse their children.Or maybe it&#x27;s protest pictures, or pro-democracy material - once you&#x27;ve shipped this for CSAM, plenty of countries will immediately say \"now you can do that, also include this opaque database of criminal images\".Or it could be Iran saying \"images of women without a hijab should be reported\".You need to understand, once you say \"a persons device should report a specific kind of content on a device to any entity\", the technology is in place, and the original \"specific kind\" becomes whatever the country says a legal requirement, and it&#x27;s legally required to report to the government. reply nonethewiser 13 hours agorootparentprevSo is there a Chat Control hearing in the US or not? Even so, that’s just whataboutism. reply tick_tock_tick 14 hours agoparentprevThe EU is speed running totalitarianism with good PR.

A lot of things get confusing or might mean a total opposite of what you think they do, when the relevant context isn’t taken into the account.“Private market will regulate itself” isn’t some technical term with a precise meaning that can be misused. It can “regulate itself” by not having any restrictions imposed on it, but i can also be said to “regulate itself” by exploring different solutions to challenges presented by legal requirements with no clear solution path.However, I see your point here, because most of the time when people just say “private market will regulate itself”, they talk about heavily unregulated market situations. reply aaa_aaa 55 minutes agorootparentThanks for your time, agreed. replydragonelite 13 hours agoparentprevHow else can you sponsor you nephew cyber security company....

    "title": "HTTP/2 rapid reset attack impacting Nginx products",
    "originLink": "https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-2-rapid-reset-attack-impacting-f5-nginx-products/",
    "originBody": "Skip to content EN F5 Sites Search Contact F5 NGINX Solutions & Products Resources Blog Support Partners Get F5 NGINX Free Trial Resources > Blog > News HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack Impacting F5 NGINX Products Michael Vernik of F5 Sr Product ManagerOctober 10, 2023 Nina Forsyth of F5 Director of Product Management This blog post centers on a vulnerability that was recently discovered related to the HTTP/2 protocol. Under certain conditions, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute a denial-of-service attack on NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, and related products that implement the server-side portion of the HTTP/2 specification. To protect your systems from this attack, we’re recommending an immediate update to your NGINX configuration. The Problem with HTTP/2 Stream Resets After establishing a connection with a server, the HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to initiate concurrent streams for data exchange. Unlike previous iterations of the protocol, if an end user decides to navigate away from the page or halt data exchange for any other reason, HTTP/2 provides a method for canceling the stream. It does this by issuing an RST_STREAM frame to the server, saving it from executing work needlessly. The vulnerability is exploited by initiating and rapidly canceling a large number of HTTP/2 streams over an established connection, thereby circumventing the server’s concurrent stream maximum. This happens because incoming streams are reset faster than subsequent streams arrive, allowing the client to overload the server without ever reaching its configured threshold. Impact on NGINX For performance and resource consumption reasons, NGINX limits the number of concurrent streams to a default of 128 (see http2_max_concurrent_streams). In addition, to optimally balance network and server performance, NGINX allows the client to persist HTTP connections for up to 1000 requests by default using an HTTP keepalive (see keepalive_requests). By relying on the default keepalive limit, NGINX prevents this type of attack. Creating additional connections to circumvent this limit exposes bad actors via standard layer 4 monitoring and alerting tools. However, if NGINX is configured with a keepalive that is substantially higher than the default and recommended setting, the attack may deplete system resources. When a stream reset occurs, the HTTP/2 protocol requires that no subsequent data is returned to the client on that stream. Typically, the reset results in negligible server overhead in the form of tasks that gracefully handle the cancellation. However, circumventing NGINX’s stream threshold enables a client to take advantage of this overhead and amplify it by rapidly initiating thousands of streams. This forces the server CPU to spike, denying service to legitimate clients. Denial-of-service by establishing HTTP/2 streams, followed by stream cancellations under abnormally high keepalive limits. Steps for Mitigating Attack Exposure As a fully featured server and proxy, NGINX provides administrators with powerful tools for mitigating denial-of-service attacks. To take advantage of these features, it is essential that the following updates are made to NGINX configuration files, minimizing the server’s attack surface: keepalive_requests should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests http2_max_concurrent_streams should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams We also recommend that these safety measures are added as a best practice: limit_conn enforces a limit on the number of connections allowed from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. limit_req enforces a limit on the number of requests that will be processed within a given amount of time from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. How We’re Responding We experimented with multiple mitigation strategies that helped us gain an understanding into how this attack could impact our wide range of customers and users. While this research confirmed that NGINX is already equipped with all the necessary tools to avoid the attack, we wanted to take additional steps to ensure that users who do need to configure NGINX beyond recommended specifications are able to do so. Our investigation yielded a method for improving server resiliency under various forms of flood attacks that are theoretically possible over the HTTP/2 protocol. As a result, we’ve issued a patch that increases system stability under these conditions. To protect against such threats, we recommend that NGINX Open Source users rebuild binaries from the latest codebase and NGINX Plus customers update to the latest packages (R29p1 or R30p1) immediately. How the Patch Works To ensure the early detection of flood attacks on NGINX, the patch imposes a limit on the number of new streams that can be introduced within one event loop. This limit is set to twice the value configured using the http2_max_concurrent_streams directive. The limit will be applied even if the maximum threshold is never reached, like when streams are reset right after sending the request (as in the case of this attack).

It does wonder to provide context to such an important topic. reply ComputerGuru 10 hours agoprevI’m stuck trying to figure out if this is technically desired behavior or not. If you were retroactively designing http&#x2F;2 with this knowledge, would you have done anything different? reply kelthan 9 hours agoparentYes, because it&#x27;s exploitable.Systems that require very high cognitive load on their human operators (whether machines, programming languages, etc.) are alway destined to fail. Human beings are not good at doing boring, repetitious work that requires them to stay focused: lapses will occur. And hackers are going to find and exploit those gaps. So the best way to avoid those problems is to build solutions or specifications in which those gaps are not even possible.Modern software systems are some of the most complex systems that humans have ever invented--and they just keep getting more complex over time as we layer new things on top of them. Think of a really high Jenga tower with lots of holes in the base.That means we need to strive to keep things simple. That may mean making decisions that prevent common or severely impacting failure cases from being possible, even if it is a little more difficult to do, or eliminates an esoteric use-case. This is even more true when writing specifications that others will implement and&#x2F;or be expected to conform to. reply j16sdiz 9 hours agorootparentI guess the parent post want to know if there are any _specific_ and _effective_ change for this kind of attacks.In this case, simplifying the protocol won&#x27;t help -- the vulnerability is: 1. Backend servers can&#x27;t cancel immediately (this is no protocol problem) 2. The client can make concurrent request in a connection (This is the goal of Http&#x2F;2) 3. The concurrency is pre determined, there is no way for the server to throttle without user-visible error. 4. The client can cancel any request mid-flight (removing this is equally bad, security-wise)Unless you are removing the concurrency, making the protocol simpler won&#x27;t fix it.The protocol designer need adversary mindset, not a simpler mind reply tedunangst 6 hours agorootparentYou should be able to cancel a request, but you don&#x27;t get it back (as in, can&#x27;t send another) until the server acks the cancel. reply kuekacang 51 minutes agorootparentIn agent-like app sure. But how would you detect connections from multiple client instance? replyamelius 3 hours agoprev> this vulnerability can be exploited to execute a denial-of-service attackTitle should contain this info. reply codetrotter 14 hours agoprevHehe, when I heard about the attack a couple of days ago I was interested to know if Nginx was affected and did a search on Google for the CVE of that attack followed by the name of Nginx.I didn’t find anything relevant so I assumed that Nginx was not affected.Turns out that was not a good assumption :p reply herpderperator 14 hours agoparentIf you read the article, you&#x27;ll see that the default configuration is not affected. reply ziddoap 12 hours agorootparentCVEs aren&#x27;t restricted to only consider default configs. reply gshulegaard 11 hours agorootparentThere is a difference between an application being innately vulnerable and a user configuration exposing a vulnerability.Interestingly enough, HAProxy seems to have the same mitigation:> Until HAProxy dips below the configured stream limit again, new stream creation remains pending—regular timeouts eventually apply and the stream is cut if the situation does not resolve itself. This can occur during an attack.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haproxy.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;haproxy-is-not-affected-by-the-...That is, if I read it correctly, default configuration is safe and you can use configuration of stream limits to ensure you are not vulnerable, but they are saying HAProxy is not vulnerable...at least in the title. Later on they soften the language:> HAProxy remains resistant to HTTP&#x2F;2 Rapid Reset reply hsbauauvhabzb 11 hours agorootparentI think the important distinction is ‘a user may plausibly have this non default configure’ vs ‘this config is obscure almost nobody will be running it this way’ reply gshulegaard 10 hours agorootparentI am not sure I understand how stream limit configuration between two L4&#x2F;L7 load balancers is meaningfully different. In my mind, either the configuration of stream limits is a vulnerability for all L4&#x2F;L7 load balancers that offer that configuration or it&#x27;s not for all of them.If one doesn&#x27;t _offer_ configuration of stream limits and therefore is not susceptible to user misconfiguration, then I would get the distinction. But as I understand it both HAProxy and NGINX have the same configuration options which _could_ be vulnerable if configured poorly by the user. One is just putting a lot more positive spin on it. reply codetrotter 13 hours agorootparentprevI know. But not everyone uses the default configuration. reply k_roy 7 hours agorootparentthe article literally points out the somewhat rare configuration you would have to have to be exploited by this.The way this headline is worded is pretty misleading, and you clearly sucked it up. reply codetrotter 5 hours agorootparentHere’s the thing. I use Nginx. Some of the configurations in which I use Nginx were mostly copy-pasted from recommendations from third-parties. Hence, my initial assumption which had been that no action was needed when I didn’t find anything mentioning Nginx with this attack when I searched a few days ago, needed to be revisited.Because when I saw the op article it turned out that there was reason for me to have a closer look at my Nginx instances. To see if any of the configs that had been recommended by third-parties involved changing values that could lead to this attack being able to affect me.> you clearly sucked it upClearly not. Or at least, not without reason. reply otherme123 4 hours agoparentprevI did the same search a couple days ago with Duck, and this blog entry was the first or among the first results. reply ahoka 13 hours agoparentprevI immediately thought I’m happy not having to operate anything with nginx in front of it. reply k_roy 7 hours agorootparentSo you are operating every other product that was impacted by this?This headline is pretty misleading as the article outlines you would need a fairly non-standard config to be exploited like this.Versus many other products that the stock configs are vulnerable. reply nimbius 10 hours agoprevFYI this is for the commercial nginx product, hastily purchased by F5 a few years back when software load balancers were annihilating their hardware offering.Curious to see f5 still playing games with their own cve disclosure on the bigip product though...assigning it a mitre cw400 is just lying.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.f5.com&#x2F;manage&#x2F;s&#x2F;article&#x2F;K000137106 reply gshulegaard 10 hours agoparentBoth http2_max_concurrent_streams and keepalive_requests (the configuration parameters discussed in this article) are configuration parameters available in open source nginx:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;http&#x2F;ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_...http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;http&#x2F;ngx_http_core_module.html#keep...So are limit_conn and limit_req:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;http&#x2F;ngx_http_limit_conn_module.ht...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;http&#x2F;ngx_http_limit_req_module.htm...So it pertains to both NGINX and NGINX+. reply bullen 1 hour agoprevJust use HTTP&#x2F;1.1, it&#x27;s the final protocol.Nothing Google or Microsoft does will dethrone it.Forget the browser; use a C or Java client and HTTP.If they block port 80, just use another port.They cannot win. reply eastdakota 13 hours agoprevFrom some first-hand experience over the last few months… these suggestions and patch will help prevent a single client from overwhelming an NGINX server, but it will do little to stop even a modest botnet from generating enough requests to be a problem. Keeping some state on IPs and downgrading those that exceed limits to HTTP&#x2F;1.1 I believe is the only effective defense. Tuning those thresholds to get them right is… challenging. reply 22c 11 hours agoparentIf the only viable fix is to downgrade clients to an earlier protocol, do you take that to mean that there is a fundamental weakness in the protocol itself? reply getcrunk 9 hours agoprev> layer 4 monitoring and alerting toolsWhat do you guys use? Anything foss and not an applicance? reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 10 hours agoprevIf someone asked me how to \"speed up the web\", I would not suggest \"use HTTP&#x2F;2\". I would remove ads and other garbage. As a decades long non-popular browser and TCP client user, I can testify this works very effectively. I prefer to have full control over the resources that I request, whether text or binary, so no auto-loading resources, no Javascript-requested resources and no HTTP&#x2F;2 \"server push\". The clients I use do not auto-load resources, run Javascript nor carry out \"server push\". Works great for me. Web is not slow.According to HTTP&#x2F;2 proponents, the protocol originated at an online advertising services company and was developed by companies that profit from sale and delivery of online advertising, HTTP&#x2F;2 was designed to \"speed up the web\".I respect that opinions on HTTP&#x2F;2 may differ. If someone loves HTTP&#x2F;2, then I respect that opinion. In return I ask that others respect opinions that may differ from their own, including mine. NB. This comment speaks only for the web user submitting it. It does not speak for other web users. IMHO, no HN commenter can speak for other web users either. Thank you. reply jillesvangurp 1 hour agoparentHTTP&#x2F;3 is now the version to upgrade to. We&#x27;re in Google cloud so we&#x27;ve been running that for some time now without issues. Works great actually.I don&#x27;t get all this anti HTTP 2 & 3 sentiment on hacker news. What&#x27;s wrong with people here? HTTP 1.1 is a quarter century old at this point. This sounds just like a bunch of grumpy old men arguing against progress. Time to move on. Yes HTTP&#x2F;1.1 works. But it&#x27;s also a bit limited and slow in various ways that both new HTTP variants address. One little bug in nginx is not going to change anything. Bugs happen all the time. They get fixed and people move on. I&#x27;m not hearing a lot of rational arguments here. reply wvenable 10 hours agoparentprevI would say that a text-only experience is valid I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s how the majority of people want to use the web. Users want a rich multimedia experience.If HTTP&#x2F;2 speeds up a rich multimedia web experience then it may legitimately be one way to \"speed up the web\" for someone who expects that level of experience.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to criticize a protocol for who designed it. The specification is out there for anyone to interpret and if there is specific complaint in it&#x27;s design then make that. reply otabdeveloper4 1 hour agoparentprevI work in adtech and I haven&#x27;t heard anybody in the industry push for HTTP&#x2F;2.It&#x27;s still HTTP&#x2F;1.1 everywhere here. reply veeti 9 hours agoparentprevHTTP2 Server Push has been deprecated already https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;removing-push&#x2F; reply gear54rus 9 hours agoparentprevWell you ain&#x27;t getting no-JS webpages because it&#x27;s too useful so maybe HTTP&#x2F;2 in the end?
