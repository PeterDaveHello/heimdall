    "originBody": "Skip to content CHARITY.WTF Sidebar HOW TO COMMUNICATE WHEN TRUST IS LOW (WITHOUT DIGGING YOURSELF INTO A DEEPER HOLE) August 17, 2023mipsytipsycommunication This is based on an internal quip doc I wrote up about careful communication in the context of rebuilding trust. I got a couple requests to turn it into a blog post for sharing purposes; here you go. In this doc I mention Christine, my wonderful, brilliant cofounder and CEO, and the time (years ago) when our relationship had broken down completely, forcing us to rebuild our trust from the ground up. (Cofounder relationships can be hard. They are a lot like marriages; in their difficulty and intensity, yes, but also in that when you’re doing it with the right person, it’s all worth it. ) TIPS FOR CAREFUL COMMUNICATION When a relationship has very little trust, you tend to interpret everything someone says in the worst possible light, or you may hear hostility, contempt, or dismissiveness where none exists. On the other side of the exchange, the conversation becomes a minefield, where it feels like everything you say gets misinterpreted or turned against you no matter how careful you are trying to be. This can turn into a death spiral of trust where every interaction ends up with each of you hardening against each other a little more and filing away ever more wounds and slights. Yet you HAVE to communicate in order to work together! You have to be able to ask for things and give feedback. The way trust gets rebuilt is by small, positive interactions. If you’re in a trust hole, you can’t hear them clearly, and they can’t hear you (or your intent) clearly. So you have to bend over backwards to overcommunicate and overcompensate. There are lots of books out there on how to talk about hard topics. (We actually include a copy of “Crucial Conversations” in every new employee packet.) They are all pretty darn cheesy, but it’s worth reading at least one of them. I’m not going to try and cover all of that territory. What follows is a very subjective list of tactics that worked for Christine and me when we were digging our way out of a massive trust deficit. Power dynamics can admittedly make things more difficult, but the mechanics are the same. ACKNOWLEDGE IT IS HARD BEFOREHAND: “I want to say something, but I am having a hard time with it.” “I have something to say, but I don’t know how you’ll take it.” “I need to tell you something and I am anxious about your reaction.” What this does: forces you to slow down and be intentional about the words you’re going to use. It gives the other person a heads up that this was hard for you to say. Most of all, it shows that you do care about their feelings, and are trying to do your best for them (even if you whiff the landing). … OR CHECK IN AFTERWARDS. “I’m not sure how that came across. Is there a better way I could have phrased it?” “In my head that sounded like a compliment…how did you hear it?” “Did that sound overly critical? I’m not trying to dwell on the past, but I could use your help in figuring out a better way.” It’s okay if it’s minutes or hours or days later; if it’s still eating at you, clear the fucking air. SPEAK TENTATIVELY. “Speak tentatively” is the exact opposite of the advice that people (especially women) tend to get in business. But it’s actually super helpful when the relationship is frayed because you are explicitly allowing that they may have a different perception, and making it safer to share it. “From my perspective, it looks like these results might be missing some data… do you see the same thing?” opens the door for a friendly conversation based on concrete outcomes, whereas “You’re missing data” might sound accusatory and trigger fear and defensiveness. TRY TO SOUND FRIENDLY. Say “please” and “thank you” a lot. Add buffer words like “Hey there”, or “Good morning!” or “lol”. Even just using emojis will soften your response to an almost unsettling degree. This may seem almost insultingly simple, but it works. When trust is low, the lack of frills can easily be read as brusque or rude. TAKE A BREATH. If you are experiencing a physical panic response (sweating, heart racing, etc), announce that you need a few minutes before responding. Compose yourself. Firing off a reply while you are in fight-or-flight mode reliably leads to unintentional escalations. If you need to take a few beats to read and process, take the time. But empty silence can also generate anxiety so maybe say something to indicate “I’m listening, but I need a minute to absorb what you said”, or “I’m still processing”. (We often use “whoa…” as shorthand for this.) (Alternately, if you find yourself really pissed, “whoa” becomes a great placeholder for yourself to get yourself under control before saying something you’ll regret having to deal with later.) “THE STORY IN MY HEAD”. When you are in a state where you are assuming the worst of someone and reading hostile intent into their words or actions, try to check yourself on those assumptions. Repeat the words or behaviors back to them along with your interpretation, like: “The story in my head is that you asked me to send that status email because you don’t trust me to have done the work, or maybe even gathering evidence that I am not performing for a PIP.” This gives them the opportunity to reply and clarify what they actually meant. ENGINEER POSITIVE INTERACTIONS, EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO INVENT THEM. Relationship experts say that there’s a magic ratio for happy, healthy relationships, which is at least five positive interactions for every one negative interaction. If you only interact with the people you have difficult relationships when you have something difficult to say, you are always going to dread it. Forever. It might seem artificial at first, but look for chances to have any sort of positive interactions, and seize them. COMMUNICATE POSITIVE INTENT. In a low trust environment, you can assume everything you say will be read with a voice that is menacing, dismissive or sneering. It behooves you to pay extra attention to tone and voice, and to add extra words that overcommunicate your intended meaning. A neutral statement like “That number seems low”, or “Why is that number low?” will come out sounding brusque and accusatory, e.g. why isn’t that number growing? it’s your fault, you should know this, I blame you, you’re bad at your job. Not might: it will. Try to immunize your communication from distortion by saying things like, “Hey, I know this just got dropped in your lap, but do you have any idea why this number is so low?” “This number seems lower than usual. I’m wondering if it’s due to this other thing we tried. Do you have any better ideas?” “I know it isn’t exactly in your wheel house, but can you help me understand this?” “I’m new to this system and still trying to figure out how it works. Should this number be going down like this?” It may seem excessive and time consuming, but it will save you time and effort overall because you will have fewer miscommunications to debug. GIVE PEOPLE THE OPENING TO DO BETTER. We tend to make up our minds about people very quickly, and see them through that lens from then on. It takes work to open our selves up again. “Assume positive intent” is a laudable goal, but in practice falls short. If every word someone says sounds accusatory or patronizing to you, what are you supposed to do with that advice? Just pretend you don’t hear it, or tell yourself they mean well? That’s not sustainable; your anger will only build up. But if you can hold just enough space for the idea that they might mean well, then you can give them the opportunity to clarify (and hopefully use different words next time). Like, Person A: “Why is that number low?” Person B: “I’m not sure.” (pause) Person B: “…. Hey, sorry to interrupt, but the story in my head is that you think owning that number is part of my job, and now you’re upset with me, or you think I’m incompetent at my job.” Person A: “OMG no, not at all. I’m just trying to figure out who understands this part of the system, since it seems like none of us do! Sorry for stressing you out!” and maybe next time it will start off like… Person A: “Hey, do you have any idea why this number is low? It’s a mystery … nobody I’ve talked to yet seems to know.” REMEMBER THE HANDICAPS, VALUE THE EFFORT. Ever meet someone you didn’t like online, and realize they’re terrific in person? Online communication loses sooooo much in transit. Christine and I know each other extremely well, and still sometimes we realize we’re reading way too much into each other’s written words. That’s when we try to remember to move it to “mouth words”, aka zoom or phone. Not as good as in person, but eons better than text. Once you’ve met someone in person, it’s usually easier to read their written words in their voice, too. Some people just aren’t great at written communication. Some people have neurodiversities that make it difficult for them to hear tone. Some people have English as a second language. And so on. Do give points for effort; if they’re trying, obviously, they care about your experience. To the best of your ability, try to resist reading layers of meaning into textual communication; keep it simple, overcommunicate intent, and ask for clarity. And if someone is asking you for clarity, help them do a better job for you. SHARE THIS: TwitterFacebook LIKE THIS: Loading...

You may need to give the other person part of what they want as a gesture of good will. I&#x27;ve seen this go a long way in certain situations.Of course, this comes with some caveats. For example, if there&#x27;s a power imbalance in a damaged relationship, it&#x27;s not appropriate for the disadvantaged side to be making sacrifices. Also, the person making the sacrifice is entitled to notice whether or not the other party appreciates it. After all, no one wants to be taken advantage of.The point is sometimes you just need to demonstrate a charitable attitude when you want things to get back on track. reply jfengel 11 hours agoparentIf you trusted that a sacrifice would be received, you wouldn&#x27;t need to make it. You&#x27;d already have trust.Instead, both sides will view themselves as disadvantaged. That&#x27;s how you got into this mess.You can do it anyway, and live with the fact that you expect it to be a waste. Sometimes that touches off a virtuous cycle. Sometimes it reinforces a vicious one. There&#x27;s no way to know beforehand. reply nerdponx 11 hours agorootparentThe question is: is it worth it? How far do you have to degrade yourself before you decide that the other person won&#x27;t come around? Maybe it&#x27;s better to just split and spend your effort elsewhere. reply thelittleone 3 hours agorootparentSuper important point. And I&#x27;d say not even about degrading but more about deviating from own true self. In relationships, the need for security &#x2F; protection is often measured in the degree of sacrifice the partner is willing to offer up. The problem is it&#x27;s a temporary effect as this new sacrifice will at some point becomes the new baseline.I used to sacrifice too much thinking this was how to express love, but often it&#x27;s counter productive. Either becoming a crutch for the partner or completely losing a sense of self.Example is phone messages. My girl used to get insecure and ask to see them, I had nothing to hide but obliged. Until I recognise this was feeding insecurity and crossing boundaries. I changed my perspective and the next time I said no. That was met with \"arr you hiding something\" (i wasnt) but explained concept of sovereignty. She stopped asking. It certainly puts the responsibility on her in that case to deal with her past issues rather than me being a bandaid for them.That&#x27;s one example, and I&#x27;m just as often the one doing the wrong in my relationship. Interesting learning experiences. But me taking this firmer position has been very important in my wellness. reply yawgmoth 3 hours agorootparentprevDegrade is an interesting word. I am comfortable changing for others to make them comfortable because the behavior is not about me and I simply know myself a enough to not mind. reply jahewson 10 hours agoparentprev> it&#x27;s not appropriate for the disadvantaged side to be making sacrifices.No it totally is. The entire point in it being a sacrifice is that it comes at some cost and it’s not something you have to do. If you’re basically forced to do it, it’s not a sacrifice. If it’s no sweat of your back, it’s not a sacrifice. This applies to both parties. There’s no one-dimensional thing called “power”. If there was then there would be 100% absolutely nothing you could do about the situation. reply jancsika 8 hours agorootparent> If you’re basically forced to do it, it’s not a sacrifice.You just declared this by fiat. People are forced into making sacrifices all the time, and there are no logical fallacies up their sleeves. reply RangerScience 6 hours agorootparentIt’s semantics, and I don’t mean that to be dismissive - GP sounds like they’re using a definition of “sacrifice” that’s essentially voluntary; you sound like you’re using a definition of sacrifice that’s essentially hmmm maybe “diminishing” (“I am less that I was before I sacrificed”)I do agree with GP, in sentiment - part of the impact of giving something up in these situations is that it is voluntary.Forced sacrifice - I don’t think that can restore trust, only subservience; which, to be sure, can be seen as trust in certain situations (the loyalty of a yes-man, for example), but I’d strongly argue that that isn’t the kind of trust the article is talking about. reply MichaelZuo 9 hours agorootparentprevAgree, this happens all the time in the real world, in fact close to the norm in some situations.e.g. Secretary messes up bosses&#x27; calendar&#x2F;email&#x2F;etc... really badly, usually with the help of a computer, and has to work overtime to fix it, without extra compensation. reply sublinear 9 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not sacrifice. reply notnaut 9 hours agorootparentSure it is. Fucking up is part of a job. If you’re working 9-5 on the clock, you don’t have to fix shit after 5. Choosing to stick around to fix your mistake off hours without pay when you could do it the next day or take comp time later is a sacrifice of your time&#x2F;money. reply ako 7 hours agorootparentIf I hire someone to work on my house and they fuck up, e.g., hit a water or gas pipe, I expect them to fix it asap, with no additional pay. Fucking up is not part of the job if you’re doing the hiring……Happened to me once, long time ago, I was cleaning up an oracle db production server, and by accident deleted to system datafile of the database. Sat there till midnight to fix it, but at least I had proof the backups were working… reply lelanthran 5 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t see a difference between a contractor and an employee? reply ilyt 1 hour agorootparent...does the company do, except for the amount of paperwork ? reply lelanthran 44 minutes agorootparentWell, yes. There&#x27;s a legal difference when overtime is being worked.Companies go to court over the distinction. reply donw 6 hours agorootparentprevNo.This highlights one of the key differences between owners and employees.Employees are not nominally liable for mistakes they make while employed, excepting things like gross negligence or malicious behavior.If an employee makes a mistake, forcing them to work \"off the clock\" to fix that mistake is a violation of labor law in pretty much every jurisdiction of which I am aware.An employee could volunteer to do so, but frankly, as a \"boss\" myself, I would neither expect nor accept such a gesture.Mistakes happen. It&#x27;s part of the cost of doing business, and if you&#x27;re a competent businessman, you factor that in. What I expect is that that employee won&#x27;t make the same mistake again.But I have and will never expect someone to work without being paid as agreed. reply ilyt 1 hour agorootparentprevI think that heavily depend on severity of the fuckup.If you comitted a bug bringing the whole site down at 16:50 then went \"welp, I won&#x27;t fix it in 10 minutes, sucks to be on ops team today!\", your login wouldn&#x27;t work tomorrow reply wahnfrieden 8 hours agorootparentprevThat’s wage theft. It’s criminal to expect or not compensate for (unless salaried which is free season for exploitation) reply MichaelZuo 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause...? reply bmelton 12 hours agoparentprevOne should also expect it to take time. Perhaps the best analogy I&#x27;ve heard is that trust is a glass jar -- it can be slowly diminished or emptied out all at once (or the jar could indeed shatter), but absent extreme circumstances, the way in which it is usually built is by adding one marble of trust at a time and without doing anything to damage the trust until the jar is full. reply marcod 13 hours agoparentprevI agree, to phrase it a little different, you have to make yourself vulnerable to repair a connection. Ideally, both sides will :) reply sph 5 hours agoparentprev> If trust has been damaged, it might take more than just talk to repair it. You may need to give the other person part of what they want as a gesture of good will.Reminds me of mob movies.If one of your guys killed the rival&#x27;s daughter, to avoid a war the best you can do is meet the rival, be sorry, say you should&#x27;ve been more vigilant and offer your guy or two (the sacrifice) so they can punish them and extract revenge. reply m463 10 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prisoner&#x27;s_dilemma reply SeriousM 6 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t put labor at the same level as imprisonment, aren&#x27;t you?You&#x27;re free to leave the employer. If you want to sacrifice your life&#x2F;free to to gain something in the specific target area you already know that this behavior is expected and usual there.Labor is only imprisonment if you degrade yourself to it. reply m463 4 hours agorootparentsorry should have added more context, this isn&#x27;t about prison. It&#x27;s game theory about limits of cooperation in low trust environments.\"The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a game theory thought experiment that involves two rational agents, each of whom can cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner (\"defect\") for individual reward\" reply donw 12 hours agoparentprevYou are correct.Words are cheap, and trust is expensive to repair, if it can be repaired at all. reply innagadadavida 12 hours agoparentprevAs a software engineer in a fast paced high expectations team, I’ve come to realize writing tests is a good way to show this charitable attitude especially when you are new and have little knowledge and little leverage. reply apsurd 16 hours agoprevGreat read. Another helpful cue I give myself is \"The opt-in\". Always give your partner the chance to opt-in to the conversation.Opt-ins can be subtle or explicit relative to the heaviness. Opt-in can be a simple pause allowing the other person to volley back. A chance to follow up with questions, contribute, or change the subject heh. TONS of people don&#x27;t do this. myself included. Take a beat.For hard conversations, explicitly ask them if they are are ok talking about X, or if they have time: \"hey I wanted to talk about the fight last night, do you have time now?\" reply kevinmchugh 13 hours agoparentI learned this from The Effective Manager. When giving feedback you always ask if the person is open to it. It gives them the chance to avoid&#x2F;delay if it&#x27;s a bad day, and makes them bought in. reply lastangryman 7 hours agoprev> Say “please” and “thank you” a lot.I remember a previous role the team leaders all went on a management training course. Everyone came back and started adding \"please\" to every request. I found it really patronising and felt like I was being spoken to like a 5 year old.> \"Can you run the SQL update in prod?\"Vs> \"Can you run the SQL update in prod please?\"The \"please\" sounds like an exasperated parent that is fed up giving the instruction.I&#x27;m also starting to get really sick of emojis everywhere. I don&#x27;t think they added to this article at all. I hope it&#x27;s just a temporary fad we are going through and this isn&#x27;t the future of written communication. reply arketyp 7 hours agoparentYeah. This is good advice and all but it&#x27;s no use if embraced only by behavior on a superficial level. Then it&#x27;s just cosmetic and can be quite vile at worst, like seeing guys repeat pick-up artist tricks. reply worble 1 hour agoparentprevYeah I hate \"please\", but assuming I&#x27;m with a cohort that understands it, \"pls\" seems to work a lot better, i.e:>can you merge that pr plsI&#x27;m not sure why, I guess it just sounds a lot more casual when written down and read? It still gets across that it&#x27;s a request, not a command, but without that patronising tone. Generally speaking I&#x27;ve very much gone from speaking very formally in chat with my teammates to casual chat where I no longer care for punctuation or capitalisation, makes it feel a lot friendlier I guess?Obviously for official comms&#x2F;emails&#x2F;talking to someone I don&#x27;t know I format properly and professionally but for day to day stuff I just like keeping casual, like you would speaking in the office I guess. reply denkmoon 4 hours agoparentprevNever went on a management course and never been a manager, I always say please and thankyou. It&#x27;s polite. Sorry you have a chip on your shoulder about it though. reply wink 1 hour agorootparentI think there is no hard rule. Some people say that all the time, some never. Some have a friendly tone and don&#x27;t need it, but if they add it suddenly it can appear like mentioned. No one said you should stop and I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t annoy people if it comes naturally.It&#x27;s the same as when sales people talk to me and intersperse \"Well, Mr. wink, you know about this great offer, that will benefit you, Mr. wink, very much. As I said earlier, Mr. wink.\" - makes me want to end the call right at the 2nd mention. reply chownie 1 hour agorootparentprevBeing patronising comes naturally to some people, don&#x27;t worry about it too much. reply winternewt 7 hours agoparentprevWhen people use a lot of emojis, the story in my head is that they care more about keeping appearances up than about honesty and transparency. It&#x27;s fake positivity. reply RugnirViking 2 hours agorootparentI disagree. I feel there are certain \"styles\" of emoji use. I don&#x27;t know if I can explain it well. for example ive worked with people who are really good communicators who use things like sunglasses emoji or muscle emoji to make you actually feel good and keep concise clear communication. But people who make some big long official announcement then pepper it with random emojis to make it more \"fun\" can be extremely offputting. There are appropriate times to put them but you gotta anticipate how your audience is likely to feel and use them to show you&#x27;re communicating in good faith, and if you&#x27;re communicating in bad faith, just don&#x27;t use them at all, we can all tell.Also the choice and timing of emojis can be good or bad. Honestly I think it literally comes down to a culture difference between hr types and engineers reply felurx 6 hours agorootparentprevThen tell them that! Give them the feedback they need so they can know how to communicate with you better. (Talking about person-to-person relationships, of course)In the end, this is a matter of taste. Just because something works for someone, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it will work for everyone. But also: Just because something fails to work for someone, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it will fail to work fo everyone. reply IggleSniggle 2 hours agorootparentprevI like to use emojis when they allow me to get denser content, especially if it&#x27;s to be printed to a TTY. As long as there&#x27;s a key somewhere, reducing var names to a single character allows you to pack in a lot more information, while simultaneously being far more expressive than eg \"i\", \"j\", \"k\". It gives you the benefits of columnar data without requiring scrolling back to see headers or even requiring that the columns be perfectly evenly spaced. reply watwut 26 minutes agorootparentprevI usually imagine they hang around people who use emojis a lot. No reason to get offended over someone growing up in slightly different culture. reply lodovic 6 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m just hearing Bill Lumbergh.. \"Yeah if you could just go ahead and run that SQL query .. that would be great\" reply jstarfish 6 hours agoparentprevBioshock gave me the idea, but I find \"would you kindly...\" goes over a lot better. reply klibertp 2 hours agorootparent...aren&#x27;t you afraid someone will take a golf club and hit you with it?Honestly, the fear of saying this phrase to someone who just happened to play Bioshock and saw Ryan&#x27;s monologue is enough for me to never-ever use it. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d react if I heard it directed at me, but I&#x27;m 99% sure I&#x27;d - at the very, very least - say \"No, I would not\" and go away. There&#x27;s a fine line between \"formative\" and \"traumatic\" and I&#x27;m really not sure on which side that playthrough falls, even 15 years later. reply raxxorraxor 3 hours agoparentprevIndeed. A much better approach is to say thank you if something was done if it was demanded, even for daily business tasks.Usually the &#x27;please&#x27; is superficial because there is no way to say &#x27;no&#x27; without an excuse. reply paganel 3 hours agoparentprevIt depends on the culture. Come to Eastern Europe (and I guess to other similar cultures, South America maybe?) and see how far you can go without saying \"please\" or \"thank you\". Not that far, I can tell you that.Even though things are beginning to change for the worst in tech world, but, then again, many of the tech people in here see themselves as North-Westerners who happened to be born in the wrong place. reply uoaei 4 hours agoparentprevYeah if it&#x27;s just tacked on at the end it may come across as manipulative. There&#x27;s better ways to rephrase it that is less patronizing, such as:\"Please run the SQL update in prod and notify me when it&#x27;s complete.\" reply byteware 7 hours agoparentprevyes, coworkers thanking me for a bugfix or a feature bothers the hell out of me. man I am not doing it for you, I am doing it for money that is thanks enough reply politelemon 6 hours agorootparentThat isn&#x27;t the same thing. Your efforts can still be appreciated as it will have had had a positive impact on them. They&#x27;re merely expressing it, which is something people do. After all, if everyone assumed the attitude in your last sentence, it would make for a highly unpleasant environment overall and make work a lot more stressful. reply brightlancer 5 hours agorootparentprev> yes, coworkers thanking me for a bugfix or a feature bothers the hell out of me. man I am not doing it for you, I am doing it for money that is thanks enoughAnd they&#x27;re thanking you for doing something that will keep them employed.I had a customer one time like you. I was talking with her on the phone and I was phrasing requests (as I often did) as \"would you do this for me?\"\"I&#x27;m not doing this for you, I&#x27;m doing this for my boss,\" she repeatedly responded, while repeatedly ignoring my directions.Accept the expression of gratitude, even if your inner narcissism doesn&#x27;t want you to. reply byteware 37 minutes agorootparentnot like I am vocalizing this damn, that would be effed up, I am just silently feeling this way then respond and act according to the expected norms reply stefandesu 7 hours agoprev> Ever meet someone you didn’t like online, and realize they’re terrific in person? Online communication loses sooooo much in transit.This is so true. I have a good friend who is, in my opinion, really bad at this. It seems like he has a talent to make even little requests sound aggressive when using written communication. If I didn&#x27;t know him so well, I would certainly interpret that as very rude, even though in RL he&#x27;s not like that.Thinking about this, I realize I have something like this as well. With close friends, I can be VERY direct in a way that&#x27;s both not completely serious, but still carries my true opinion. And I think I do this without thinking too much, it just comes out (although it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen with people I&#x27;m not that close with, maybe because I&#x27;m more guarded and self-conscious during those conversations). Luckily my friends can appreciate this tendency even though it would come across as super rude if I did that to a stranger.(I guess I can&#x27;t say if my friend&#x27;s case above is actually very similar. Maybe he, too, uses different language with people he&#x27;s less close with, trusting that his good friends know him well enough.) reply Aachen 3 hours agoparent> > Online communication loses sooooo much in transit.> This is so true. I have a good friend who is, in my opinion, really bad at this.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true at all. Most people, I can perfectly well talk to online and can occasionally have an easier time talking to than in person. The person I&#x27;d classify as my best friend, for example, I literally speak to 1-2 times a year, the rest is text conversations (at least once a week we have a longer chat I&#x27;d estimate).But I also know some people that are or were close to me who are terrible at texting. I can&#x27;t seem to help them improve, either. If I&#x27;d believe that not everything can be learned to some extent, I&#x27;d say this is apparently something innate. They don&#x27;t come across rude at all, in my case, but just no conversation flow whatsoever. It&#x27;s a bit comparable to doing one of those interviews where you have to coax every word out of the interviewee.(There is also the category of people that only ever text on a phone (slow) or just can&#x27;t type at a conversational speed in the first place (50wpm&#x2F;250cpm maybe? Just a guess), or have dyslexia and find reading more than half a phone screen&#x27;s worth of text a significant hurdle. That&#x27;s different and not what I mean about being bad at texting.)Maybe you and the author are not people who are good at texting, and that&#x27;s why you feel it is &#x27;so true&#x27; that a lot is lost in text messages? Or maybe most of my friends and I are the outliers, that honestly wouldn&#x27;t surprise me either, but either way, this thing portrayed as universal truth is far from it reply IggleSniggle 2 hours agorootparentI agree. My spouse accuses me of only being able to communicate properly via text, and i think it&#x27;s true. I am very uncomfortable in face to face interaction and struggle to find words, but the written word uses a different part of my brain and is easy to communicate with.

The other parties naturally feel unheard or steamrolled over and end up calling the person a narcissistic asshole, but in my personal experience, that’s hardly ever actually the case, or at the very least, there’s no way of knowing if they are actually a narcissist.If my experience is common (and let’s be real here, unless you’re in the psychology field none of us are qualified to diagnose narcissism), of course this stuff won’t help because the person is right and nothing would sway them, and bitter folks, or maybe jealous folks, decided to proclaim the person has a mental illness (read, they are now flawed and you are superior) as well as insulting them calling them an asshole.And it’s kinda weird the other way too because if they do indeed have a mental illness, then they are not trying to be abrasive and often wouldn’t even be aware that they were until after the fact, so you’re calling a mentally ill person an asshole because they are mentally ill. Try doing that to someone with any other mental issue and see how well that goes over. But it’s fine to do for this one and everyone is fine with it.It’s shitty to go into a conversation with the best intentions and yet you always end up fucking it all up, hurting the relationship with that person when your goals were the exact opposite, being confused about why that always happens, and reflecting after the damage is done and seeing where you fucked up, tossing that onto the never ending pile of regret that follows you though life, your lonely lonely life because it’s impossible to maintain any relationship at all, not for long anyway… and then on top of it you’re called an asshole by someone who doesn’t have any idea how much it blows being a narcissist, or they don’t understand that it’s not the same thing as someone choosing to be a dick in a conversation. reply ChrisMarshallNY 15 hours agoparentprevI do it all the time.

This is people in mental or physical pain. Mother Theresa might have kicked her cat, when she was having a particularly nasty headache. We&#x27;ll never know.Understanding people is different from advocating for them, or \"taking their side.\" If you want to understand rats, talk to an exterminator. I know a couple, and they really understand the little buggers.But also keeping control of my side of the relationship is incredibly important. It should not depend on them. If they are unreliable or dangerous, then it is incumbent upon me, to limit the scope of our relationship.Easy enough, if we are not in a situation that demands we work together, but I have also done a lot of work, with some very difficult people.It can be done, but, in my case, it requires that I be quite self-aware, and take responsibility for my part of the relationship; which includes not expecting stuff from people that can&#x27;t give it.WFM. YMMV. reply toast0 13 hours agoparentprevOvercommunication isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad way to handle that type of interaction, either.

When in reality there’s nothing you can do.I’ve learned trust is something you can’t lie to yourself about. It’s mentally so taxing to walk on eggshells constantly. The other side has to put in work.And I don’t need justification for not trusting someone else. The burden on proof for trust should be relatively high.

I can&#x27;t say that I know any universal solutions, but I&#x27;ve found it effective to essentially acknowledge it up front when first communicating with someone (e.g. a new member joining the team); despite working remotely, I always try to hop on a voice call with new teammates the first time I ever help them with anything so that I can better convey that I genuinely do want them to feel comfortable reaching out to me and that I will never be unhappy with them reaching out to ask something, even if it turns out that I might not be able to for some reason. At least for people I need to communicate with on an ongoing basis, being able to make a clear first impression can help mitigate any potential misunderstandings later on.In the absence of being able to do a voice call for an initial impression (e.g. if someone needs immediate help and I&#x27;m not available to do a call, or if it&#x27;s someone I don&#x27;t expect to need to talk to again in the future), the best strategy I&#x27;ve found is to directly state my good intentions. When I&#x27;ve had one-off discussions with support engineers at my current job to try to help them figure out a customer issue, I often start off by saying something like \"I definitely can help you with this issue! If I&#x27;m slow to respond or accidentally miss some piece of information, it&#x27;s totally fine to ping me again as much as needed; I might have to temporarily stop focusing on helping you to deal with other stuff that comes my way, but if I haven&#x27;t said otherwise, you can assume that any prolonged radio silence on my end is from me forgetting rather than not wanting to help still :)\".

It&#x27;s analogous to the game where one person taps out the rhythm of a melody and the other person tries to guess which song it is. It seems so obvious to the person doing the tapping, because their head is loaded with all the other context of the song; namely, the harmony and melody. None of that context is available to the recipient. reply HPsquared 13 hours agorootparentprevIt can be difficult to fine-tune the level of formality.Maybe another application for LLMs? \"Conversation softener\" reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentAbsolutely.

The &#x27;globalism culture&#x27; has waned and there&#x27;s not much common ground to relate to across countries and cultures. reply OJFord 14 hours agoparentprev> In my experience, men, engineers, and especially engineers who are men tend to think of this as unnecessary fluff. They often decline to add these little social niceties because to them, they sound inauthentic.I really hate to make such a clichéd and usually flawed argument, but can you imagine the reverse going down well? And if the male cohort (to continue this stereotype&#x2F;generalisation&#x2F;simplification) don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s only a &#x27;social nicety&#x27; for the rest right? It&#x27;s not at all obvious to me that that should be a goal.It&#x27;s a lot easier to have your diverse group &#x27;transmit&#x27; in the way they each prefer than it is to invert and have them use the others&#x27; preference - and it&#x27;s not clear that that&#x27;s better anyway? Especially if you&#x27;re aiming for equity on the team, in which event it would be arbitrary, so why not go for easy.But really I think people are so diverse in personality and communication style that, especially on a people-you-actually-work-with sized team, gender is irrelevant even if you&#x27;re correct about its link to exclamation marks, not least because there&#x27;ll be so much else besides them.Something I have been doing semi-consciously is using question marks more, even though it was grammatically a statement. Sort of: I&#x27;m not ordering you to do this thing (I&#x27;m not in a position to anyway but maybe that&#x27;s not clear) I&#x27;m just pretty confident in this, but you should feel able to correct or &#x27;challenge&#x27; me.E.g. (code review context) I don&#x27;t think we should wazzle the foobar here, because the splines aren&#x27;t reticulated until L94.Vs. I don&#x27;t think we should wazzle the foobar here, the splines aren&#x27;t reticulated until L94? reply Cushman 13 hours agorootparentThat’s a good perspective to bring!One question, though: do you think it would make the rest of your comment materially worse communication if you added just one excessively positive but non-load-bearing sentence at the beginning? Maybe something like “That’s a good perspective to bring!”Maybe that’s not the way you communicate most sincerely, the way it is for me and others. Maybe I sound insincere to you right now, in which case, please do say so!But all else being equal, if you knew that that single change would make me and others materially more receptive to the rest of your comment, would you consider just… doing it anyways, out of pure self-interest?Just food for thought :) reply OJFord 13 hours agorootparentInteresting!If we can be honest with one another though, your comment reads to me as not just insincere, but condescending. This might be cultural more than ..&#x27;genderal&#x27; - I was hearing echoes of &#x27;thank you so much! You&#x27;re so welcome!&#x27; familiar from even the most mundane interactions in the US. (It&#x27;s quite jarring when you say &#x27;thanks&#x27;, for having been sold something in a shop say, expecting to leave it at that, to be told you&#x27;re so welcome.)What I was intending to get at above was that if I have a duty to communicate with you as you&#x27;d like to be communicated with(!), then surely you would also want to reciprocate? If there are just these two &#x27;communication personas&#x27; on the team, and they&#x27;re evenly split, isn&#x27;t it a lot of effort for nothing, aren&#x27;t we better off using what makes most sense to us personally, since just as many others agree as disagree anyway? reply ketzo 12 hours agorootparentIn principle, I agree -- no one is entitled to one communication style or another, and we should all respect each others&#x27; preferences.But the problem is that the flow between those personas is not bidirectional.Again, generalizing a lot here, but let&#x27;s call them Cold and Warm personas.If a Cold receives a Warm message, generally speaking the worst they might feel is that the other person is being inauthentic. In my experience, what usually happens is that they just filter out all the niceties as extraneous and get on with their day. As time goes on, they won&#x27;t necessarily change their communications or relationship with that person -- after all, they&#x27;re still getting what they need from them.On the other hand, if a Warm receives a Cold message -- if they notice a pattern of receiving Cold messages -- they might take that as standoffishness or outright hostility. Even if it&#x27;s not that negative, the Warm simply won&#x27;t build as much trust as they otherwise might. They aren&#x27;t getting what they need.So in this scenario, if everyone communicates as they naturally would, Colds don&#x27;t notice anything wrong, while Warms feel like they&#x27;re actively missing out on something important to them.I would also note that, again in my experience, most people who describe themselves as Cold communicators (\"I don&#x27;t want fluff, just communicate directly with me\") actually really appreciate people who communicate with lots of social niceties. They respond to them more quickly, they&#x27;re willing to explain misconceptions, and so on. They just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because of communication style. reply leetcrew 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t agree. I am what you would call a Cold, but maybe just have slightly more social awareness than you&#x27;re imagining. I can&#x27;t just \"filter out the niceties\". I perceive them as setting the expectation that I will reciprocate similarly. I usually at least try to do so, but it not intuitive for me and requires a lot of energy.not a big deal either way, I can muster up a few friendly greetings on my way into the office every day, and the Warms I encounter could also try to read the room a little better. I just don&#x27;t agree that the impact is as asymmetric as you say. reply Cushman 11 hours agorootparent> I perceive them as setting the expectation that I will reciprocate similarly.You know, this might be challenging to hear... I think there is such an expectation. And along the lines of what &#x27;ketzo said above, I kind of think it&#x27;s a categorically good expectation.The only thing you might be missing, not because you&#x27;re not socially sensitive, but just because it&#x27;s non-native communication to you, is that those people genuinely care. The expectation isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;ll respond with a cheery reply-- it&#x27;s that you&#x27;ll respond with care.What I might put on the table for you is, what if you think about it as replying in kind, rather than in form? If someone says something cheerily nice to you, you don&#x27;t have to say \"omg thank you!! :D\". You can just say \"Thank you.\", from the heart, however you say it when you really mean it.And yeah, some people will still take that as you being unkind. And if you mean it, that means they&#x27;re the socially insensitive ones. They&#x27;re the ones who don&#x27;t really care! You don&#x27;t owe them anything more.But... I think you might be surprised at how many people really are willing to meet you exactly where you are, as long as you really do care. reply leetcrew 9 hours agorootparent> You know, this might be challenging to hear...

The expectation isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;ll respond with a cheery reply-- it&#x27;s that you&#x27;ll respond with care.I will genuinely reflect on this, but my initial reaction is that I still don&#x27;t agree. I think context may be important here.I am going to work for a very specific reason: to complete enough tasks between 9am and 5pm so that I do not have to stay until 6, 7, or 8pm. I don&#x27;t have a choice on this; my employer requires my physical presence in the office X days a week, and I am still figuring out how to maintain the same level of output that I achieved during WFH. \"connection\" is not something I seek at the office (among other things, I am in an unusual situation where 0% of my org actually works at the location I am assigned to). to be very frank, I am only there for the money, and I don&#x27;t welcome distractions from that goal.outside of work is a different story. in that context I basically agree with you, so I won&#x27;t restate what you said.I will leave you with one idea though: the concept of \"peace\". peace is what I feel when I walk from the metro stop to my office with my earbuds in. it is the last moment in my work day (before my commute home) when I can just exist. this is what people are disturbing with their niceties, genuinely felt or otherwise. I don&#x27;t expect the entire world to conform to my way of being, I just don&#x27;t agree that mine is categorically worse in the specific context of work. reply Cushman 6 hours agorootparent> I will genuinely reflect on thisAnd I genuinely appreciate that. Your care does shine through in those words. To me, you don’t need to say more… I don’t desire to be agreed with more than I desire peace for your life.You’ve said you don’t seek “connection” at the office, and without knowing exactly what that means to you, I can’t assume that you’re seeking it here either. So, take this as you will:You made me feel listened to. To me, that’s enough. Thank you.(And yes, I’d probably put an emoji here if I could, chosen to emphasize gentleness and compassion. Likely a leaf, a sprig, or one of the non-romantic flowers. To me, this all feels so heavy without it, and lightening the words would undercut them.Maybe a sparkle… idk. I wouldn’t normally think about it, but it seems important to say out loud, here.When you read this, maybe you can picture a little flower, just meant to help you believe that I really do care how what I’ve said makes you feel.) replyCushman 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I totally get that. And I absolutely knew going in that suggesting you write exactly the same thing I wrote in that exact comment couldn’t help but sound condescending.But in complete honesty, hedging around it any more than that would have felt insincere to me. And in exchange I got sincere feedback! So really, I’m just doing things your way, and I’ve seen the benefit of it :)With that said, for your future reference: if you hadn’t said “Interesting!” first, I wouldn’t be engaging charitably right now— I’d be debating whether to engage at all. Based on the next sentence I’m guessing you meant it more as a way to call my sincerity bluff, but I’m telling you it fucking works. Might be an idea to keep around?To your parenthetical: One other thing to keep in mind is that those employees (I’ve been one) have to talk to terse, grumpy people all day long, and even if it’s not reciprocated, that can be a way to carve out a little moment of real human kindness. I’d keep some weight on the possibility that, sometimes, for a moment, they do just genuinely hope you have a good rest of the day.I know there’s probably no way I can now convince you that I genuinely hope you have a good rest of the day, so, uh… take care? reply mitchellvdub 12 hours agorootparentprevI understand your point about the (theoretical) equal split between styles, so why close one or the other.But I think you&#x27;ve landed on choosing your own way, when really you should try and match the vocal tone of the other person. After all the point of communicating is to get the other person receptive to your point.And this goes both ways, I think overly perky and chipper people need to understand introverts and low-energy communicators, and match their tone as well. reply Cushman 12 hours agorootparentYes, this is exactly how I approach professional communication. My emails sent to different stakeholders vary wildly in style.If you’re invested in getting something out of a conversational partner, it’s obviously best to write in a way that sounds like a thought they, themselves, could have had— in fact, are having. And contra &#x27;ketzo’s original point, I deeply appreciate that so many we-have-to-say-mostly male tech stakeholders purposely don’t massage their language that much, and thereby make their brains that much easier to hijack.I bring my effusively positive personality to HN largely because I don’t have any real motive or theory of change, other than possibly making it a slightly more comfortable environment for people who will read my comments precisely as written.Oh, I’m so curious if this comment sounds more sincere to the reader :) reply mikem170 9 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s a lot easier to have your diverse group &#x27;transmit&#x27; in the way they each preferYour post was thought provoking, something I appreciate.

It helps break up a message that can otherwise feel flat and cold. reply Cushman 13 hours agorootparentAs a data point, the last email we got from our closing attorney was a single sentence ending in a period.

I think it really depends on the context and the person.

It&#x27;s more efficient. ;)\" is extremely hostile in my mind. That phrasing is already over the top horrendous but the ;) amplifies it by 10x.As for a breakdown of why I think it&#x27;s horrendous: \"Your method\"Hey, I ran your solution and it&#x27;s working nicely. Thanks a lot! By the way, recently I&#x27;ve been working on profiling our code so performance is on the top of my mind. I ran the profiler against this PR and noticed a dip in performance in one of the functions. Do you want to hop on a call sometime to explore a few ways we can refactor xyz function? Really curious to hear what you think and after thinking about this for a while I have an idea or 2.But that&#x27;s making a PR comment into a meeting, which is something I&#x27;d kinda dread and want to avoid.That said, I agree that this> Your method technically works but next time try xyz instead.

It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s the wrong emoticon.> this works, but xyz would be better (more efficient) :)Would be a bit ambiguous in tone, but I think at least invites an optimistic reading as well.For me I&#x27;d rather the niceties in a PR (as well as proposals to meet) live in a comment at the beginning or end of a PR.

They&#x27;re the workplace equivalent of \"we need to talk\". I&#x27;m an anxious person by nature, so \"we need to talk\" is about the most painful thing you can say to me: my mind will immediately project out the worst possible case, and the relief I get when your real issue is nowhere nearly that bad isn&#x27;t going to fully absorb the cortisol the opening generates for me.Fortunately, the article anticipates this, and you&#x27;ve misread it a bit. Notice the headline for the follow-up is \"OR check in afterwards\", not \"AND check in afterwards\".Checking in afterwards is the right alternative when you&#x27;re working with me. It might not be with other people.And, the straightforward answer to the question your comment asks: yes. Yes, you have to make them feel better about it. When you&#x27;re working on a team, part of your responsibility as a team member is to keep relationships working smoothly.To put it in Reddit parlance: if someone steps in it with you, and then asks you to make them feel better about it afterwards, and you get irritated about the check-in: YTA. Not ESH: YTA. They did the right thing by (1) being concerned they handled the initial interaction poorly and (2) following up on it to clear the air.

I tried Ubuntu, Manjaro, and Fedora, and all were extremely janky to downright broken. On screen keyboard was completely broken with Wayland, with some apps like Firefox just not popping it open, to others ignoring input. X had trouble with screen rotation. Fedora wouldn&#x27;t let me past the login screen unless I connected a keyboard, which was compounded with a bug that was causing the screen to lock every sixty seconds. Manjaro ended up lasting the longest, but at that point I had just given up trying to fix things and reverted to using the Surface as a laptop with a touch screen.I don&#x27;t know how much touch screen only computers are considered during development of desktop environments and display servers, my experience left me with the distinct feeling that I had gone way outside of the bounds of the target user of these applications. Maybe I just had bad luck. Hopefully if this is truly an under-served side of the Linux desktop experience, a successful product like this will help push the ball forward on improving support for this niche. I wonder how much the popularity of the Steam Deck is pushing the KDE team to improve touch screen support as well. reply EGG_CREAM 3 minutes agoparentI have a surface with Ubuntu and the Surface Kernel (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;linux-surface) , and it works really wonderfully. I will say, before installing the Surface Kernel, it was very janky. reply rdschouw 10 minutes agoparentprevI am using a Surface Go 2 with Arch &#x2F; Wayland &#x2F; Gnome. I use the Linux surface kernel and all of the hardware works except the IR camera and webcam. Overall, it is a good experience. I love using it as a notebook with the pen and Xjournal++. Battery life is 7 hours or so.The OSK pops up when I need to. There is a Gnome extension to make it work better like adding ctrl, alt and cursor keys for instance.I also use Gnome extension to force apps to open maximized.I use it primarily as a tablet at home and a travel laptop for work. I am quite enamored with it. reply gumballindie 30 minutes agoparentprev> I wonder how much the popularity of the Steam Deck is pushing the KDE team to improve touch screen support as well.Works like a charm on my OLED touchscreen laptop. I am actually surprised by how better KDE looks compared to windows or macos and how stable it is (KDE version 5.27.4 that is). reply amiga-workbench 2 hours agoparentprevI just bought a ThinkPad X1 Tablet Gen 3. Everything works great, the on screen keyboard is actually functioning properly and appears on demand every time. Screen orientation is handled properly and promptly. The only let-down so far is battery life, but I need to make some adjustments to help there.I&#x27;m running the latest version of Fedora workstation, under wayland too.This thing is the only truly repairable tablet I&#x27;ve encountered so far, 8 screws and the display pops off, no glue, no can opener required like a Surface Pro. 9 screws to get the heatsink off (they&#x27;re all captive) and you&#x27;re at the full size NVME SSD.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mos6581.com&#x2F;pictures&#x2F;thinkpad&#x2F;x1-tablet.jpg reply bootsmann 6 hours agoparentprevIdk how recent you tried this but I had the entirely opposite experience with an old Asus transformer mini (which has similar detachable keyboard shenanigans as the surface). Ubuntu had some issues rotating the screen but Fedora worked out of the box. The only complaint was that sometimes you had to coax it to bring up the on-screen keyboard, but everything else, from screen rotation to the gnome finger swiping gestures worked really well in both laptop and tablet mode. Maybe its microsoft using a particularly strange hardware stack or just luck. reply no_time 7 hours agoparentprev>On screen keyboard was completely broken with Wayland, with some apps like Firefox just not popping it openDid you check if FF was actually running in wayland mode? Not trying to blame you, the current situation is pretty dire. The only reliable way of finding out if something is actually using wayland is running xeyes and seeing whether the eyes move above the target window. reply voxadam 3 hours agorootparent> The only reliable way of finding out if something is actually using wayland is running xeyes and seeing whether the eyes move above the target window.In Firefox all you have to do is navigate to about:support and check verify that Window Protocol shows wayland. reply fignews 2 hours agorootparentprevBeen using wayland on Fedora for years and I don’t know what you’re talking about.

It works fine, Firefox needs to be started in \"wayland\" mode. The on-screen keyboard could be better, but it does pop up predictably. Screen rotation just works.edit: Touch controls also work, including gestures. It has a pressure sensitive stylus, which also works OOB. reply ponorin 7 hours agoparentprevSurface lineup is a weird one because Microsoft uses a non-standard firmware, but even still the support on many devices are great. I have a Surface Go 3 and despite the poor processor it flies on Fedora and I use it daily to do light tasks. Perhaps try with linux-surface kernel? reply specproc 5 hours agorootparentAs someone who just this week tried to put Linux on a Surface (laptop 4), I can categorically say I&#x27;m not going to try that again. Totally broken, not even booting properly. reply DANmode 4 hours agorootparentTo be fair...Windows 11 on the Surface Laptop line is janky as shit.I&#x27;d be far more interested in what experiences people are having with Linux on a proper Surface Tablet. reply wildrhythms 1 hour agorootparentI remember working at an IT desk and trying to help a poor college student with their Surface Tablet, it would immediately thermal throttle just opening Microsoft Word, the whole unit slowed to a crawl. I helped them remove the bundled antivirus trial crapware and turn off a bunch of startup junk, but between the performance and the uncomfortable keyboard and trackpad it seemed like a miserable device to use for any serious purpose. reply tiahura 17 minutes agorootparentprevTo be fair it’s running great here. reply FirmwareBurner 2 hours agoparentprev>I don&#x27;t know how much touch screen only computers are considered during development of desktop environments and display serversProbably close to zero. Gnome&#x2F;KDE devs daily drive desktops&#x2F;laptops and for phones&#x2F;tablets they don&#x27;t run FOSS Linux devices but also iOS and Android.Desktop Linux is already a niche market, and FOSS Linux tablets&#x2F;phones is even more niche. The only \"Linux\" built and polished for touch from the ground up is Android but I put Linux in commas for good reason there. reply resonious 7 hours agoparentprevI suspect this is largely because the Microsoft Surface products contain a lot of proprietary hardware components that aren&#x27;t not well supported by the kernel. KDE and friends have pretty good touch screen support, but it&#x27;s all for naught if you have no drivers. reply Fluorescence 2 hours agorootparentI found Ubuntu Wayland touchscreen keyboard very broken on a Dell laptop with decent linux driver support. It&#x27;s a real shame, worked perfectly with X. reply fifteen1506 6 hours agorootparentprevNo OSK on X11 though, on KDE.Gnome has on both. reply fboerman 2 hours agoparentprevinteresting because I have been running archlinux on a surface pro 7 and it works flawlessly appart from the camera. I use the linux-surface kernel, instructions can be found here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Installa.... Highly recommend it! reply bArray 30 minutes agoprevReminds me of the Pine Tab (v1) with the contact pins at the bottom, fold-up keyboard, etc. Having an Intel processor would make me heaps more confident about good kernel support out of the box. The A64 by Pine is essentially abandoned for Linux kernel development.This device looks great, I would just take care expecting too much from that keyboard. It looks almost identical to the Pine Tab keyboard and that was not great. reply eternityforest 12 hours agoprevWhy did they have to use a micro HDMI port? Couldn&#x27;t they have done dual USB-C and made one the DisplayPort output? MicroHDMI is not a very nice connector, it&#x27;s a lot of pins under mechanical stress from the heavy, rigid HDMI people generally attach to it. reply ryantse 8 hours agoparentFrom : Micro HDMI USB Type C 3.2 with Power Delivery 3.0 USB Type C 3.2 with Power Delivery 3.0 Micro SD Memory Card Reader 3.5mm Headphone Jack HDMI version: 2.0 USB-C Interface: Display Port (DP Alt Mode) USB version: 3.2 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps)Maybe I am missing something, but it seems to have Display Port for their USB-C? reply eternityforest 7 hours agorootparentOh nice! That makes it a lot more interesting reply smcleod 9 hours agoparentprevI haven&#x27;t seen one of those in many many years! I wish HDMI in general would die and let displayport take it place. reply karmakaze 8 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s the practical difference? With USB-C there&#x27;s power delivery. DisplayPort has..? reply vladvasiliu 6 hours agorootparent> DisplayPort has..?Consistently good colors. Sometimes even PC monitors won&#x27;t negotiate properly with the PC and start displaying washed out colors. IIRC this had to be forced on a Raspberry Pi on the PI side. Not all monitors can be adjusted.Consistently no under&#x2F;overscan. For some reason, the TVs we had in conference rooms figured it would be smart to cut the borders of the image and zoom in, so you get missing bits and whatever&#x27;s left is a blurry mess.For the TV situation, you usually don&#x27;t have a full remote to adjust it, if it even supports that. You often don&#x27;t have time to look up things in the TV&#x27;s typically crappy menu system. I&#x27;ve usually found the option to disable over scan, but using full-range RGB seems less common.Also, HDMI seems to lag DisplayPort capabilities when it comes to higher resolutions and refresh rates. When my 2013 MBP came out, it could drive a 4k@60 screen over DP. HDMI required the 2.0 version to do that, which, IIRC, came much later. reply karmakaze 9 minutes agorootparentOk so that sounds like DP has better negotiation protocol spec and&#x2F;or implementations.I&#x27;ve only encountered overscan on TVs not monitors, but I don&#x27;t give conference room presentations, which would be very annoying. On Macs there compensation for that.I&#x27;ve had trouble with colors where it uses YPbPr rather than RGB, but that seems to be an Apple thing where it&#x27;s done on purpose for non-Apple-approved displays and it happens for both HDMI and DP. Generating a custom EDID profile fixes that. Can&#x27;t recall having trouble with color range, sometimes the display has a setting but the default always looked better to me.I&#x27;ve used 4k@60 HDMI just fine (and 4k@30 on an early Apple adapter), but more often use 1080p anyway. I use USB-C with my 4k displays which likely runs DP on them. reply ThatPlayer 5 hours agorootparentprev>Also, HDMI seems to lag DisplayPort capabilities when it comes to higher resolutions and refresh rates.I think that one very much depends on when you chose to look at it. HDMI 2.1 has more bandwidth than DisplayPort 1.4, enough to do 4k@120 which DP1.4 wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without dropping color down to 4:2:0. DisplayPort 2.0 devices are starting to come out, but even Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 4000 series still do not have DisplayPort 2.0 (but do have HDMI 2.1). While TV started supporting HDMI 2.1 around 2019, with the PS5 and Xbox Series X having HDMI 2.1 ports.So while DisplayPort may be ahead now with DisplayPort 2.0, HDMI was ahead for at least 4 years with HDMI 2.1 reply vladvasiliu 4 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a fair point. I admit I was judging by the availability on the PC side (I don&#x27;t follow the console market).Although, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, my particular PC monitor initially didn&#x27;t support HDMI 2.0, even though it&#x27;s a 4k panel. There was a further revision which included it. I have that revision, but support is still somewhat wonky, in that it can&#x27;t seem to switch on its own from 2.0 to 1.4b. reply cirelli94 3 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve read this article from HN about it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;11&#x2F;displayport-a-better-video-i...

Are wireless displays a thing?) reply jauntywundrkind 12 hours agoparentprevDisplayPort has the huge advantage of being incredibly easy to passively convert into the ultra-legacy-weird-difficult HDMI, where-as the legacy-centric-pita-gross HDMI requires active absurd adapters to turn into DisplayPort.100% more usb-c please, with alt modes. USB4 mandates every port be able to do DisplayPort output.I really hope we start to see phones and tablets which have >1 USB port. Lenovo has an absurd beast phone, a Legion phone, with both dual batteries and dual USB-c (USB3) ports. If we get to 2030 and phones can&#x27;t plug in to GPUs something is f-ed and the system is broken, tech has ossified grossly.

It is now almost a decade. If rumors are true, Samsung will announce a USB 4 (thunderbolt 3) phone before the end of 2024. I agree with the grandparent. While most people don&#x27;t care too much for eGPU (?), I&#x27;m sure if we let people innovate, good things will come.My dream is much smaller.

Note that the modem keeps rebooting itself randomly (sometimes once a day, sometimes once every 10 minutes, with all firmware versions - this means entering the PIN again, finding the network, etc), so if you have to make phonecalls at least somewhat reliably, PinePhone is not for you. Same for PinePhonePro - the same crap modem is used in that also.

The phone part has been very reliable. The rest of the ecosystem is very minimal, almost non-existent, but I can&#x27;t complain about the basic phone functionality.With these ARM-style devices that are quite closed down and need their own respective device tree, mass adoption seems a requirement for a company and ecosystem to hit critical mass and be financially viable. I don&#x27;t think a \"Linux phone\" is enough of a value proposition to hit that critical mass without any specific features that would appeal to a non-technical crowd and can&#x27;t easily be replicated by the iOS or Android behemoths.So personally I think it&#x27;s not that the open-source&#x2F;Linux approach can&#x27;t produce a phone that has good-enough basic functionality, but that there&#x27;s no clear way to market and sell these phones to a sufficiently large crowd to offset the massive investment into a new platform.Linux as a whole might be far ahead of iOS and Android as a general computing platform, but a viable device would have to break through the mass production hardware (and marketing!) barrier. reply ryukafalz 7 minutes agorootparentI used to use Sailfish too, and it was fun at the time.

The problem is I doubt that would achieve what most people here seem to expect fur older devices.You might be able to run a really basic Linux on the older devices, but their very limited RAM will severely constrain what you can run on them.The native OS is so optimised for the hardware, trying to get better performance, or even matching power consumption on generic Linux is just not realistic.Frankly other than for hobbyist purposes the last version of the native OS is probably as functional as they’re likely to get.Having said all that, more recent iPads are powerful machines that are likely to still be very capable fur as long as they will run.

It’s easy enough to imagine a WM where you can drag windows to move them around, and drag the splits between them to resize. On Linux, this kind of paradigm is implemented by e.g. Hyprland. I dislike it for desktop, but on a tablet I’d happily use it. reply KingMachiavelli 10 hours agoparentprevIn my limited experience, sway is pretty easy to use on a tablet because it supports moving windows very will using a mouse&#x2F;pointer.

Is stuff like sleep, Wi-Fi auto connect and bluetooth headphones really solved? reply puzzlingcaptcha 1 hour agorootparentNot the parent but I have a StarLite IV as well.The keyboard is very nice. Short travel for keys but pleasant to use. I use iwd as the wireless deamon and wifi autoconnect works just fine. I do not have bluetooth headphones so cannot comment on that, but my bluetooth mouse works as expected.Battery life depends largely on how you use it. I have a minimal setup with alpine linux&#x2F;i3 and just typing in a terminal with screen at 33% brightness results in battery-reported power consumption of just under 2W which is great. Obviously a browser like firefox will impact it quite a bit. Hardware-accelerated video playback works fine.There are a few minor downsides: the built-in speaker is quite awful (not a consideration for me), the webcam is not great and the microsd card reader is usb 2.0. UEFI secure boot is currently not supported on the coreboot fw. The documentation is sparse.One weird gotcha is that the power button is one of the keys on the keyboard, so to avoid suspending your device accidentally it will only fire an interrupt after you hold it for a couple seconds.

Intel N200 is 6W. Even accounting for some differences in how both companies measure TDP only one of these can be passively cooled in that sort of form factor.The lack of low-tdp products on AMD side was also one of the reasons given by pcengines to discontinue their embedded line.

These are optional extras for me, I&#x27;ve given up on them already.Currently I am kind of stuck with the old T440p because of this, all other laptops that I bought in the last 10 years have died already with no chance of repairing or fixing them - either because of non available parts, or because literally the GPU melted down (happens more often on MacBooks than one might think, apparently).From Ultrabooks to even MacBooks, I&#x27;ve had them all, from Dell to HP, Apple and back... all died eventually and I switched back to my T440p in 2019. This old laptop still lives, can be repaired, has a replacement parts community [1], and doesn&#x27;t break when I let it fall down on the floor. But it&#x27;s now so outdated that I cannot even order battery packs anymore, because they will arrive with less than 20% capacity condition when they&#x27;re being sold as \"New\" because they&#x27;re even not produced anymore and are stored for too long.I think what I want is something like the MNT Reform laptop [2], where the battery cells are replaceable 18650 standard cells.

And I do find it absurd having to use an adapter to use a mouse with my computer. I would be very slightly less bothered if the adapters at least came with device, but they don&#x27;t, switch means that it&#x27;s something I have to buy (no, I don&#x27;t have any USB-C to USB-A adapters, because only my phone has a USB-C port).I don&#x27;t believe USB-A is past its prime, I don&#x27;t really even know what that&#x27;s supposed to mean.

    "commentBody": "Job Corps: free, residential training and education for low-income young adultsHacker NewspastloginJob Corps: free, residential training and education for low-income young adults (jobcorps.gov) 355 points by nateb2022 18 hours ago| hidepastfavorite312 comments presidentender 17 hours agoA number of my acquaintances (rural Montana) went through this after high school. It is noble and it is well-intentioned. When students stick with it it often opens new opportunities that wouldn&#x27;t be available otherwise.But it&#x27;s not a silver bullet, and it requires a certain amount of diligence and self-awareness to be able to finish the program. It&#x27;s not a party atmosphere like college or entry-level employment can be: how many 19-year-olds do you know who want to live in a dorm setting and show up on time? How many 22-year-olds want to go months without drinking?That said, it&#x27;s a clear and coherent step forward for people who might otherwise feel lost, and that&#x27;s a very good thing.Now, if only they had something for NEETs over job corps&#x27;s age limit.... reply foooorsyth 17 hours agoparent> Now, if only they had something for NEETs over job corps&#x27;s age limit....A bit ironic that the cut off is 24 and the rough age of full brain maturity is 25 (and loss of parental insurance is 26). So the young adults that had poor&#x2F;no guidance or made poor decisions in youth don’t get this opportunity once they get their head on straight and realize they need to acquire some skills (pretty common character arc for young men, at least in my circles). reply jvanderbot 17 hours agorootparentAfter 24 you qualify for significantly more financial aid for traditional or tech schools, because you are considered a \"non traditional student\".Source: used this to get my PhD coming from factory work. Regret nothing. reply da02 17 hours agorootparentCan you elaborate what financial aid you qualified for after 24? How did you discover it? Word-of-mouth or Google searches? reply the_only_law 17 hours agorootparentNot sure if this is what they meant, but I believe the financial aid system considers you to be a “dependent” if you’re under 24 period. Regardless of your tax filing status or anything else save for a few extreme circumstances.This means, that until 24, any aid you get is calculated based on your parents’ income + your income. Even if you’ve been fully independent since 18. Combined with the laughable EFC calculations, this often means less aid available. Of course if you make a middle class income, you probably still won’t qualify for any useful aid after 24. reply no_wizard 16 hours agorootparentIIRC there are two exceptions to FAFSA being considered dependent if you&#x27;re under 24One is if you are an emancipated adult. The other being if you&#x27;re married. reply zengargoyle 12 hours agorootparentI married my best friend of several years so she could get financial aid. Her financial aid counselor told her about the lengthy emancipation legal process or marriage. She came over one night with a \"I have a huge favor to ask of you\" and about a week later we were married. reply IggleSniggle 1 hour agorootparentMy spouse and I got married \"early\" in the court system for a similar reason, in order to qualify for in-state tuition. However, we then had a proper wedding in front of our family and community a few months later, so I&#x27;m not sure it would really matter to the policy makers. Definitely helped drive home for us, though: there are three different marriages in a marriage:There is a legal contract, that is important to people you have never met and will never meet, and, if things are going right, is never at all relevant to your actual marriage in any way except for how it lets you navigate government policy.There is a social contract, that is important to everyone who acknowledges you as a couple (and also people who have never business seeing you this way).And there is your actual relationship, which may be enhanced or degraded by the previous two elements, but is somewhat oblique to both. reply nyolfen 11 hours agorootparentprevdid you stay married? reply actionfromafar 4 hours agorootparentprevI would watch this movie! Would probably be better than “the Pursuit of happiness” reply midasuni 4 hours agorootparentprevI’m surprised it’s not counted as fraud reply afthonos 1 hour agorootparentThe right way to think of marriage for government purposes is a contract. If someone has entered in this contract, they get certain benefits. If the benefits are properly designed, they are valid only for the duration of the contract. As long as both people were abiding by the terms of the contract, it’s not fraud. reply IggleSniggle 1 hour agorootparentprevIt beat the fraud of getting married for the sole purpose of getting into someone&#x27;s pants! reply syedkarim 16 hours agorootparentprevI believe military service also qualifies a student as being financially independent. reply erikerikson 15 hours agorootparentYes, military service emancipates you for FAFSA purposes. reply mjn 11 hours agorootparentThere are a few others as well. As of the 2023-2024 cycle, there are 13 ways to be considered independent (any one of them suffices), according to the official list [1]. To summarize them here:1. Born before Jan 1, 2000; 2. Married; 3. Will be attending grad school [2]; 4. Active-duty U.S. military; 5. U.S. military veteran; 6. Have dependent children; 7. Have live-in dependents other than children; 8. Both parents deceased and&#x2F;or were a foster child or a ward of the court after age 13; 9. Current or former emancipated minor; 10. Legal guardian is someone other than parent or stepparent; 11,12,13. Homeless or at-risk-of-homelessness within the past year (three different routes of determination).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studentaid.gov&#x2F;2324&#x2F;help&#x2F;need-parent-info[2] Graduate students in the U.S. generally don&#x27;t get the kind of need-based financial aid that undergrads do, though, so this one is often not very helpful. reply goodkittie396 15 hours agorootparentprevYou are so right about that. Hooah! Sidenote: If you have gone to boot camp, then the college can waive all the fitness class requirements. First time go! reply the_only_law 15 hours agorootparentDo colleges usually have fitness class requirements? I’ve never seen that in any GenEd section of a degree program? reply toast0 10 hours agorootparentMy california community college did, and I believe it&#x27;s a requirement for UC and CSU as well. I don&#x27;t think the private engineering school I transfered to did; because I don&#x27;t recall anyone complaining about it.But at least at community college there were many options. Table tennis once a week for one semester wasn&#x27;t a huge burden. reply alephnerd 15 hours agorootparentprevColumbia does if you&#x27;re in the College (aka 90% of students) reply monocasa 16 hours agorootparentprevThe emancipated one has been added too. I ran into issues in the 2000s being emancipated but with FAFSA still looking at my parent&#x27;s incomes. reply slt2021 15 hours agorootparentprevemancipated route is how millionaire&#x27;s kids get in and get financial aid reply pacija 14 hours agorootparentIn my early twenties, after dropping out of faculty but before I started working, I was often literally hungry while my parents were not really millionaires, more like quite well-off. I guess they thought keeping fridge constantly empty will make me go out and look for work (I did not until 26, just traveled, couchsurfed and partied around). Ironically, I often ate at my best friend&#x27;s whose parents were on the edge of poverty, but supported him (and me) with all of little they had. reply CodeSgt 10 hours agorootparentI wouldn’t share that with people. It just makes you sound like you were a privileged entitled bum that took advantage of your less privileged friends hospitality.Because that’s essentially what you were. Hopefully no longer. reply pacija 3 hours agorootparentPerhaps. I see it differnetly. I am privileged now with my nice job, back in the day I was just a kid who was trying to become independent adult without proper guidance and support from parents. What I wanted to say is that young adults, regardless of their parent&#x27;s social and financial status, need guidance and support in order to become independent and productive members of society. I got an impression that some people think that kids whose parents are well-off or rich always get it from their parents, so they are not entitled to get it from other sources (like scholarship, discounted housing, public transit, food, cultural institutions tickets for students etc.). That is not the case. reply CodeSgt 13 minutes agorootparentThe fact that you felt the freedom to part and fuck off until 26 speaks to a degree of privilege and freedom that your safety net of parental wealth provided you that you don’t even seem aware of. ilikecakeandpie 54 minutes agorootparentprevI hope you give back or at least have done something nice for those folks who fed you so much reply nhod 3 hours agorootparentprevIt’s also how middle-class kids whose parents don’t support them in any way get financial aid.I understand why the system is the way that it is — it covers probably 95% of cases correctly — but for those of us who were essentially on our own after 18, it’s terribly unjust. reply jvanderbot 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;studentaid.gov&#x2F;help-center&#x2F;answers&#x2F;article&#x2F;independe... reply experimental123 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s very useful information. How did you go about finding resources for non-traditional students? reply jvanderbot 15 hours agorootparentFAFSA is 90% of job. Then apply for scholarships. Never take private loans. Work as much as you can to borrow low, but do what you need to do to get through. Choose a major that will make you money.In my time, factors like age mattered as much as other factors that separated you from \"the usual\". Nowadays that may not be the case. reply nradov 8 hours agorootparentprevThat thing about full brain maturity at 25 is a myth.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iflscience.com&#x2F;does-the-brain-really-mature-at-t... reply aidenn0 7 hours agorootparentLinked article doesn&#x27;t fully support the \"myth\" so much as an overstatement of the evidence; there is clear evidence that certain parts of the brain reach stop growing in volume around that age (earlier for women). There isn&#x27;t great evidence linking that to anything behavioral though. reply brightlancer 5 hours agorootparentIndividuals develop at different rates and also _start_ at different points: a child born a month early will always be a month behind, though this is far less significant at 10yo than 10mo, and that month gets lost over time in the natural variation of development.Also, the idea that girls mature faster than boys is a much more a myth; girls mature _physically_ faster than boys but not psychologically.> There isn&#x27;t great evidence linking that to anything behavioral though.Ish. There are behavioral patterns which run parallel to it, most obvious with young male aggression which plateaus in the late 20s before trending down. reply MichaelZuo 48 minutes agorootparentThe volume of certain parts of the brain is physical? reply colechristensen 17 hours agorootparentprevI really wish people would stop with the “brain maturity” age thing. reply FredPret 16 hours agorootparentIs it your impression that the brain isn&#x27;t an organ that develops from birth and reaches maturity at some point? reply gbear605 15 hours agorootparentThe age 25 thing is basically a myth. Different brain processes do continue developing into adulthood, but many finish developing younger while others never finish developing.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;brain-development-25-ye...> When we spoke, I told Steinberg his work had been referenced in this way. “Oh no,” he said, laughing. I then asked whether he had insights about where the figure 25 came from, and he said roughly the same thing as Cohen: There’s consensus among neuroscientists that brain development continues into the 20s, but there’s far from any consensus about any specific age that defines the boundary between adolescence and adulthood. “I honestly don’t know why people picked 25,” he said. “It’s a nice-sounding number? It’s divisible by five?”> Kate Mills, a developmental neuroscientist at the University of Oregon, was equally puzzled. “This is funny to me—I don’t know why 25,” Mills said. “We’re still not there with research to really say the brain is mature at 25, because we still don’t have a good indication of what maturity even looks like.” reply colechristensen 16 hours agorootparentprevNo, my issue is that people are implicitly or more often explicitly saying that folks shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to make decisions for themselves or be responsible for their actions until they&#x27;re 25. The progressive infantilization of people troubles me. That you have to spend a third of your life in this state is ridiculous. It is also self-fulfilling. People only stop acting like children when you stop treating them like children. reply foooorsyth 16 hours agorootparentI agree with your general position. Not a fan of babying people either. Still, I know a lot of people (mostly young men with minimal parental guidance) who were total idiots up to about 25 that could’ve benefited from a program like this. I much prefer stuff like this (total-immersion skill-creation programs) to EBT and section 8. I don’t see what benefit there is to the state to have an age cutoff. Just take people who want to be self sufficient reply theptip 16 hours agorootparentprevAgreed with the general thrust here; I read something recently from a scientist in the field that the 25 number is completely made up. It doesn’t come from any objective metric.That said the idea that you do most of your growing up before 25, but still do some of it 18-24 should not be controversial. I wouldn’t use that observation to deny education&#x2F;apprenticeship benefits from anyone though. reply TheCoelacanth 8 hours agorootparentprevI disagree with your implication the age of adulthood is steadily rising.In reality, it&#x27;s just fluctuating. The US&#x27;s age of majority was 21 until the need for soldiers in WWII drove it to be lowered.Other cultures have gone even higher. reply bee_rider 10 hours agorootparentprevWe shouldn’t treat people like children into their 24’s, but we should generally be more forgiving—reduce punishments for victimless crimes, make it easier to get out of debt, better social safety net.There isn’t some magic age where we suddenly stop screwing up all the time. reply deprecative 9 hours agorootparentprevIf anything, it&#x27;s a correction and we&#x27;ll get to where we need to be eventually. We went from kids being coal miners to crippling entire generations with debt that they can&#x27;t get out of with lifespans that are shrinking. reply dtjb 16 hours agorootparentprevPithy quotes don&#x27;t drive policy, science does. We can preach tough love as much as we want but it doesn&#x27;t change the physical reality of adolescent brain morphometry.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3621648&#x2F; reply Dylan16807 8 hours agorootparentScience doesn&#x27;t say to treat them like children. reply codebolt 7 hours agorootparentprev25 is around the age when you start seeing the consequences of the bad choices you&#x27;ve made during adolescence. reply q7xvh97o2pDhNrh 7 hours agorootparentPlenty of people manage to make it to much later in life without connecting those dots for themselves.About the most one could say about 25 is that it&#x27;s when people&#x27;s paths start to radically diverge, even amongst the group of people that were previously lumped together as \"high achievers.\" So perhaps the subset of that group who are relatively low-performing — and yet, somehow, high in self-awareness — will wake up and start making changes at 25. reply SamoyedFurFluff 16 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience people will act like children regardless of your own behavior… reply downWidOutaFite 15 hours agorootparentprev> The progressive infantilization of people troubles meSince you&#x27;re making this political I&#x27;d like to point out that it is conservatives that have started a movement to repeal the 26th amendment and raise the voting age. reply ozzmotik 14 hours agorootparenti believe you&#x27;ve misinterpreted the meaning of the word progressive here to refer to political progressives, rather than simply just \"gradual&#x2F;ongoing\" which is what the use of it here suggests to me personally reply colechristensen 11 hours agorootparentprevI’m sorry my intent was not political though I understand the confusion.Substitute “progressive” for “ever increasing” to retain mostly the same meaning intended. replysramam 12 hours agorootparentprevEven if you are age eligible, the \"qualifications\":> You may NOT be eligible for Job Corps if you:> - Use drugs illegally under federal law> - Exhibit behavioral problems that could prevent you or others from success in Job Corps> - Have certain criminal convictions or require court supervisionIf you have done any of these before 24, chances are really high that you were otherwise disadvantaged in life. And it&#x27;s not going to get much easier. reply l33t7332273 11 hours agorootparentI don’t think using drugs under age 24 generally means there is a really high chance that you were disadvantaged in life reply iancmceachern 10 hours agorootparentprevBy your math half of all people are disadvantaged.

Once you have shared dorm-style housing you have to be more careful about the rules.

Presumably there&#x27;s a reason for the rules -- I don&#x27;t have much experience interacting with unemployed young adults.) reply ethbr1 10 hours agorootparentFrom experience with government operations, the answer is likely because they knew it would be a lengthy, drawn-out process to get rid of someone problematic.Government program means apathetic mid-level management, lawsuits for civil rights violations, and all sorts of red tape.In most scenarios I&#x27;d envision, the person being thrown out is incentivized to try everything they can to avoid getting tossed. Which includes lying and concealing behavior.Or, they could just have a clearer rule that allowed them to remove people with unaddressed substance abuse problems.

They are instantly picked over by the upperclassmen and delivered and encouraged to party every weekend of every semester.

The structure of expectations and responsibilities that each individual had to handle every day worked great for him.Ultimately he didn&#x27;t enter the career field he chose for job corps, but it did set him up for success later. Inevitably he ends up in leadership positions at places he works.He also got his high school diploma through the program.[0] Generally because he didn&#x27;t fit in socially, and teachers treated him differently.

Oh wait, that was from my grandpa&#x27;s will.My income was like $15000&#x2F;yr, from working at a Subway. Real big wage earner.

My parents intended to (and indeed did) help me with paying for college, and their income was very modest by FAFSA&#x27;s own standards. But my parents had a decent chunk of money for their own (also modest) retirement, and FAFSA plugs that into the \"expected family contribution\" which significantly affects your eligibility for aid.I guess I could kinda see some argument for that, like \"because your parents have secured some financial stability for their own retirement, they should be able to contribute more towards college now,\" but it still seems kinda odd that a kid from a family with the same income but less saved for retirement would get more financial aid. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentWhy does it seem odd that assets as well as income would be factored in to conputation of ability to pay? reply Dylan16807 8 hours agorootparentThe problem is when the assets are derived from the income. In a situation with a stable income, saving money has an effect similar to the money getting counted twice.If two very similar families start with the same assets, and then have the same income for fifteen years, they should get the same aid.If there was some external windfall, by all means expect some of that to go to college payments. But if a family simply spent less, why should that increase expected payment? reply dwiel 12 hours agorootparentprevIts obvious why it is set up this way. That said, it can be hard to see other people who make the same wage, spend it all on fancy cars and a bigger house get more aid when you&#x27;ve been living modestly and saving resulting in less aid. reply caskstrength 4 hours agorootparentprevBecause such approach rewards irresponsible people who just blow away all their income on expensive vacations, new gadgets every year, third family car, etc. and penalizes people who diligently save for the retirement? reply tshaddox 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause the thing being calculated is the expected family contribution. I wouldn’t expect investments for retirement to be used to contribute to a child’s education. reply sharts 7 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not odd. Assets can be sold for income.We&#x27;re just not used to thinking about it that way because, in terms of taxes, assets always get special treatment because the ultra wealthy hold the majority of their wealth through assets instead of income.

Job Corps teaches job skills that are very well paid, one of the people I know was trained as a welder, another as a machinist, and one in IT. Someone with a CCNA starts at around $60k&#x2F;yr in my home town and can make more in bigger metros, and if they continue learning can be easily earning $100k&#x2F;yr+. Welders make $30+&#x2F;hr, more in large metros, which is also roughly $60k&#x2F;yr. Machinists make around $22&#x2F;hr starting out and can easily make $30+&#x2F;hr with experience or in larger metro areas.You can go \"the wages are too low\" all you want, but coming from a dead-end shit town, with minimal life prospects and dropping out of high school to having a GED and training with certifications in a field that pays above the median single-earner income nationally is a pretty good deal. I think Job Corps is a good program, I also think a lot of people who go into Job Corps are doing it as a last-ditch effort but don&#x27;t actually have any desire to take responsibility for themselves or actually work.Every single job that Job Corps trains for pays a fair wage in most markets. While it&#x27;ll likely never make you rich, it is certainly well into the \"base level of dignity\" territory.

It made very little sense on the surface, and that was because the motivation was focused almost entirely on reducing the tax rates for the wealthy.They offered a bunch of insane justifications, including the famous \"voodoo\" \"trickle-down economics\" idea that if you cut taxes for the wealthy enough, they&#x27;d use the money to boost the economy, thereby raising tax revenue, so everybody would win. Absolute bullshit, but it&#x27;s been seriously spoken of for decades like it&#x27;s an actual thing with some sort of economic or mathematical backing. reply rqtwteye 15 hours agorootparent\"Starve the beast\" really means to reduce income while not reducing spending.

They never bothered to reduce spending or increasing government efficiency in any meaningful way. reply tomrod 14 hours agorootparentCorrect, because it&#x27;s an article of faith that government must be inefficient among a multitude of other service providers. reply rbanffy 14 hours agorootparentEfficiency is not the top priority of government-provided services. The top priority is (or should be) to provide universally and fairly, without any form of discrimination against the population that make use of such services. Efficiency is a nice-to-have, while universality and fairness are hard requirements. reply tomrod 13 hours agorootparentEfficiency should be a target with a tight constraint of service provision as you&#x27;ve described. It&#x27;s the dual optimization problem of providing the most service for a given goal; rather, we should agree to a level of service being absolutely required (as you&#x27;ve laid out) then push improvement to decrease unnecessary expenditure (IMO). reply rbanffy 3 hours agorootparentExactly. Universality and fairness is non-negotiable. replyborh375 15 hours agoparentprevDoesn&#x27;t surprise me. Not sure what stereotypical Republican you have in your mind, but I&#x27;d assume it&#x27;s the kids that hate government assistance like food stamps.They hate government programs that promote lifelong government assistance and discourage work for those they think shouldn&#x27;t need it.This government program is literally the opposite long term goal: it encourages work, and hopes to reduce government assistance after this one-time program is finished. reply rbanffy 14 hours agorootparentAnd, at the same time, countless public schools don&#x27;t offer free meals for their students. reply SV_BubbleTime 17 hours agoparentprevYou can try and further an ideological religion all you like, but I am family friends with a job corp director in a deep red state, they get everything they ask for from their state legislature. reply rqtwteye 15 hours agorootparentIn the US it&#x27;s really important to separate rhetoric from what politicians really do.

Also the price point is remarkable. reply AdmiralAsshat 20 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s pretty scary, since the common wisdom these days is that appliances bought from brick-and-mortar stores should be safer&#x2F;more reliable than the random thing bought off Amazon. reply toast0 18 hours agorootparentThe aggregate safety of appliances bought through brick-and-mortar vs random imports is that failures are more readily tracked by the CPSC and patterns of failures will result in recalls.If you&#x27;re one of a small group of people that buys a dehumidifier from a brand that&#x27;s active for 3 months on amazon; chances are that brand isn&#x27;t going to be included in the recall notices when the samey design sold with persistent brands at major retailers is determined to be unsafe.On the other hand, who&#x27;s got a dehumidifier built in 2011-2014 that still works?

You&#x27;ll have to dump the water manually though.> Because rock salt is hygroscopic it absorbs moisture from the air. If your plan is to get rid of the humidity in a damp basement, start with a 50-pound bag of sodium chloride to make your rock salt dehumidifier. These can be found at most big box hardware stores. While you’re there, you’ll also need two 5-gallon buckets. Here’s what you’ll need to do next:> In one bucket, drill several small holes into the side and bottom of that bucket> Nest the drilled bucket into the other bucket> Fill the bucket up with rock salt> Collected water will drip through the holes in the inner bucket into in the outer bucket over time> Empty the outer bucket as necessary> Refill the rock salt as needed(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;homestead&#x2F;comments&#x2F;wziu44&#x2F;the_basem...) reply crazygringo 15 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s interesting but is sadly unhelpful without knowing how many gallons or liters it&#x27;s able to pull out per day, or how far down it gets humidity, or how quickly it goes through salt.E.g. my $200 dehumidifier pulls around 3 gallons of water out of the air per day, on a hot and humid summer day, to keep indoor RH around 55%.It&#x27;s very hard for me to imagine a bucket of rock salt pulling 3 gallons of water from the air, or being able to bring RH down to a target ~50% range. And even if it did, it seems like you&#x27;d probably spend more on salt over the course of a couple of summers than you would on a dehumidifier in the first place. reply iancmceachern 8 hours agorootparentExactly, we pull 5 gallons a day lately in SF. You&#x27;d go through hundreds of pounds of rock salt I&#x27;d imagine to compete with our ac reply peatmoss 16 hours agoparentprevCan’t imagine how this would match the capacity of a good sized unit. I have been renting a garage that had some leaks, and the amount of water my dehumidifier extracted when it was damp was enough to have a solid trickle of water out of the attached garden hose (into a drain). This salt dehumidifier might be good for intermittent light dampness, but I can’t see this filling a bucket in a day like a condenser based dehumidifier. reply icedistilled 14 hours agoparentprevThis sounds wasteful and like it won&#x27;t work well unless the space is air and moisture impervious. reply xkcd-sucks 20 hours agoprevDehumidifiers, refrigerators, and less so air conditioners, all have the same inherent risk of a big compressor that runs unattended for years. (For example, the Ghost Ship warehouse fire was attributed to a fridge compressor)More than a recall of specific faulty models, it would be cool to know how to evaluate compressor health so one could periodically check whether something is at risk of overheating catastrophically reply Night_Thastus 20 hours agoparentIn my experience, catastrophic failure is extremely rare.An overheating compressor starts burning its oil. That burned oil sludge then clogs everything internally, and eventually the whole system stops being able to work. It will generally get so hot it automatically turns off on overload at that point. reply pvarangot 19 hours agorootparentSo first context: I&#x27;m not OP, and as a matter of record the Ghost Ship fire was not caused by a fridge compressor. Electrical appliance is the most likely cause but the ATF investigators ruled the fridge compressor out. That being said, sparking near relay blades is common enough and same for sketchy wire bonding. It&#x27;s not a failure mode of the compressor as much as the relay or the wiring is true, but no other appliance is wired like that and turning on and off autonomously in the average household except maybe AC which are usually less modular and wired at the factory to higher standards than some old fridge or a repaired unit. reply sidewndr46 19 hours agorootparentprevevery compressor I&#x27;ve looked at was thermally protected. If it gets too hot for any reason it just shuts off. reply jandrese 19 hours agorootparentMight be a case where many of these fail every year, but sometimes they also have faulty thermo probe and catch fire. If a failed probe doesn&#x27;t cause the device to stop working then it&#x27;s entirely possible for both to be bad at the same time, especially if there is no indication that the probe failed. reply iancmceachern 8 hours agorootparentprevExactly. Modern double sealed compressors are super reliable and safe. Same thing used in every fridge and ac. reply rightbyte 14 hours agoparentprev> it would be cool to know how to evaluate compressor healthThe best way is probably to monitor low and high side pressure together with motor rpm and power. But I have never seen a fridge with manometers so ... I would listen for vibrations. Like, you can get to know how your machine should sound when happy. If it sounds unhappy, take it to the dump. reply Ekaros 17 hours agoparentprevAlso some refrigerants like R290 are flammable, so right sized leak with right mixing and spark can be cause of fire or small explosion. reply fho 7 hours agorootparentR290 is straight up propane. reply thebruce87m 17 hours agoparentprevDesiccant dehumidifiers don’t use a compressor. The alternative may have risks however. reply benoliver999 19 hours agoparentprevGrenfell was a fridge iirc reply baybal2 18 hours agoparentprevAnd it&#x27;s a big irony that LG had to cease production of their otherwise excellent linear compressors globally because they were sued to death by legal trolls in USA. reply emdashcomma 20 hours agoprevI noticed a dehumidifier in the basement of the house I moved into. I did a search for the model number - looking for a manual - and found out it was recalled. Same thing - fire risk.It&#x27;s really unfortunate because I had a home inspection done after I moved in and part of that is I get an email every month about anything in the home being recalled and that wasn&#x27;t part of it. Good thing I happened to search for that manual that day. I was able to get a partial refund on the thing, though, so that&#x27;s good (it was quite old). It seemed to have been in a \"fan\" mode, not running as a dehumidifier (water tank was empty). reply sokoloff 19 hours agoparent\"Fan mode\" in an old dehumidifier usually means that the refrigeration charge has been lost.They (almost universally) do not have service ports, but you can charge them using a bullet piercing valve (search for Supco BPV31) and restore functionality. reply jandrese 19 hours agorootparentOf course if it is prone to catching fire randomly it would make more sense to take the rebate and buy a good one instead of trying to recharge the old leaky fire hazard. reply criddell 20 hours agoprevOne of the commenters on that article says the manufacturer offered $37 in compensation for a unit they paid $200 for. That doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to me. reply housemusicfan 16 hours agoparentFor an over ten years old dehumidifier? reply slipheen 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s deprecated value isn&#x27;t the most important part if they are no longer safe to use - The replacement value is what matters. reply maxerickson 13 hours agorootparentThere are the same thing. The replacement value for a worn out dehumidifier isn&#x27;t the price of a brand new one. replydclowd9901 19 hours agoparentprevIf a product is considered a risk to home and health, it should be law that the purchasers of that product receive at least a full refund (upon company paid return of the unit). reply VincentEvans 19 hours agoprevThey sold 1,500,000 units and there were 23 fires. I am happy they are so on the ball with this - but is this really the kind of risk one needs to worry about? 652,173 to 1. I just looked it up, and my odds of being in a car accident are 366 to 1 for every 1,000 miles driven. So 366,000 to 1 for every mile. Twice as dangerous as this dehumidifier.Edit: off by a zero, so my conclusions are weaker than i originally thought. reply kube-system 17 hours agoparentComparing it to one of the leading causes of accidental death is not exactly a testament to their safety.Consider some other product safety issue -- for example, the GM ignition switch recall. 30 million vehicles were affected, and there were 124 deaths.Or the Takata Airbag recalls -- 67 million vehicles were affected and there were 27 deaths and 400 injuries.I think the most important part of a consumer safety issue is whether or not the product has a design defect with a known engineering solution that causes injury. It&#x27;s not really fair to compare these deaths to chance deaths, like car accidents resulting from human err. reply cududa 19 hours agoparentprevWell the rate of them catching fire is increasing, which means older ones are failing reply cyberlurker 19 hours agorootparentGood point. And all units sold aren’t necessarily in active use. In some areas they may only be used on occasion. reply housemusicfan 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d be curious to know how many of the units that caught fire never had the filter cleaned, were used in a dusty area, or otherwise poorly maintained.You&#x27;d be surprised at how many people never change their furnace filter (or even know it exists). reply Ekaros 17 hours agoparentprevI how many failures are left unreported. That is dead units with some signs of burning. reply wkat4242 12 hours agoparentprevIf they don&#x27;t recall these units will keep working in the field and racking up more avoidable deaths. Would that really be preferable? reply virtuous_sloth 20 hours agoprevWe need supply-chain provenance and OEM transparency for technical products just like we need them for food production. reply rapht 18 hours agoparentFull transparency is probably impractical as soon as the product is complex enough, but whenever inside a product there is one \"main component\" (such as is the case here), that should be indeed be properly traced - and it would cut the crap from companies who slap their brand on a plastic case hiding mostly the same core component - sometimes at laughlingly distant pricing points. reply voytec 15 hours agoprevReminds me of Dyson-branded crap I&#x27;ve purchased.I&#x27;ve bough an AM04 heater&#x2F;cooler device. It was ok. But some 2-3 weeks after warranty has ended, it stopped turning off when achieving configured heat level. It&#x27;d turn off the internal fan (\"fanless\" is false advertising as there&#x27;s a super loud fan inside, just not visible from the outside) but would still output heat. The effect was the smell of heated&#x2F;melting plastic and dangerous increase of temperature around the device.I&#x27;ve contacted Dyson despite the device being (barely but) out of warranty.They&#x27;ve graciously offered a replacement - a brand new AM05 model. The color would be glossy white instead of matte gray&#x2F;blue, but the device was supposedly an upgrade with predecessor&#x27;s problems fixed. I&#x27;ve got no warranty, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it. It&#x27;d by 2 years after I got the device.Guess what has started happening with the replacement AM05 model after (again!) just few weeks since the warranty would have ended? It had the exact same defect AM04 had - it wouldn&#x27;t turn heating off after reaching configured setting, but would cut off just the fan, resulting in melted plastic smell and air temperature exceeding 65+°C close to the seemingly powered down device.A dedicated site[1] now exists for recalling just these two models: AM04 and AM05. But fuck Dyson - I&#x27;ll never purchase any of their unsafe devices again and I don&#x27;t want their free replacement crap.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dysonrecall.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;info reply cheschire 11 hours agoparentSounds like fantastic engineering if they can predict to the quarter when their devices will fail. reply EricMausler 20 hours agoprevIs there something fundamental about these items that might apply to other dehumidifiers?I bought one recently and do not see it pictured, but would like to know if there&#x27;s any additional due diligence I can do reply seatsniffer 20 hours agoparentI&#x27;ll preface this saying that I&#x27;m not an expert on dehumidifiers and don&#x27;t work one them, but I do have a background in hardware electrical design and thermal engineering.There are different types of dehumidifiers, typically you&#x27;d use a refrigerant based system. Without proper ventilation the compressor can overheat, the refrigerant is also typically flammable, lubricants also. Design flaws and not maintaining the system can cause reliability issues. If a device has been designed by a competent team, there should be a thermal cutoff ie when the motor gets too hot it will shut down. A badly designed system may not have this at all, or the thermal sensor might be somewhere stupid meaning the measured temperature isn&#x27;t the one that matters, its also possible the cut off is too high. It&#x27;s also possible a crap compressor&#x2F;motor is being used and driven too hard for the use case.Bad wiring is also possiblly an issue.With a peltier system. They use a lot of power. Components can get really hot such as the power electronics used to drive the peltier cooler.Another poster mentioned water and electronics together with poor design can cause fire risks. This is absolutely true.Without actually having these failed devices I can&#x27;t really give much more insight than that. But I hope it gave anyone a basic idea. reply crazygringo 19 hours agorootparent> Design flaws and not maintaining the system can cause reliability issues.What do you mean by not maintaining the system?I have a dehumidifier but beyond cleaning the filter every month or so, there&#x27;s literally nothing else to do. reply jandrese 19 hours agorootparentNot sure why you are being downvoted. Most of those home dehumidifiers don&#x27;t have any user serviceable parts outside of a paper filter. Even inspecting the components would require a laborious disassembly of the device the manufacturer never intended. reply seatsniffer 19 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m more used to working with larger scale industrial equipment where the user&#x2F;operator can exchange parts and actually change lubricants etc.As far as home&#x2F;personal devices the best you can really do is clean out any filters, get rid of dust etc and listen for when the motor inevitably fails or starts to fail at some point. reply brewdad 16 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re cleaning the filter. That&#x27;s more than a lot of people do. reply baybal2 18 hours agorootparentprevYou forgot one massive pointShort circuit due to vibration letting sharp parts cut through insulation.Normally, cabling near vibrating parts must be installed in a protective sleeve, but penny pinchers pinch. reply cududa 20 hours agoparentprevI have a GE one that looks almost exactly like the but wasn’t in the recall. It seems they overheat. During the summer when it’s humid, the thing is running pretty much 24&#x2F;7 and while it reduces humidity, it blasts out heat.But, every 8 hours or so it shuts down for ~20 minutes. Never understood why. I now suspect it’s because it needs to cool down. I’d guess that the component that triggers the cool down is faulty in these listed units. reply xkcd-sucks 20 hours agorootparentUsually it&#x27;s because the cooling coils ice over (up to the point of completely blocking airflow... which could cause overheating) and the downtime is to let this ice melt reply ceejayoz 19 hours agorootparentYup. Your fridge&#x27;ll do the same thing. reply op00to 20 hours agorootparentprevHow hot? A dehumidifier will typically raise the temperature of the air flowing through it by 10 degrees F or so. reply derbOac 20 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know about this recall, but I&#x27;ve learned over the years that dehumidifers seem to be a frequent recall risk due to fires.One of my dehumidifers (my penultimate one) was replaced because it started giving of a smoking smell, and I learned that it was the subject of recalls because they would spontaneously and violently start on fire.I got my money back but reading about the history of fire hazards in this product category has made me very nervous about owning any dehumidifier.The problem is they can also prevent a lot of property damage due to humidity, so it&#x27;s a sort of pick-your-poison problem. reply Abekkus 20 hours agorootparentControlling humidity cant prevent human damage from mold, as well. reply tmoertel 19 hours agorootparentWhat is \"human damage from mold\"? reply sokoloff 19 hours agorootparentMany molds are damaging&#x2F;toxic to humans. GP appears to be using \"human damage\" in addition&#x2F;contrast to \"property damage\".For our family, I manage the April-November humidity in our home to be in the 40-50% RH range as part of the overall indoor air quality efforts to improve comfort and health. reply asddubs 19 hours agorootparentprevdamage to humans from mold reply metalliqaz 19 hours agorootparentprevSome molds release toxins that make people sick. reply brookst 17 hours agorootparentprevI mean the key risk factors for fires are hot, dry, and windy. And many dehumidifiers are all three, by design. reply brianwawok 20 hours agoparentprevThey have electricity and they have water, so I would guess it has a higher risk than someone without water... but I don&#x27;t think there is a global problem from humidifier fires (outside here) reply progbits 20 hours agoparentprevShit construction? reply jey 20 hours agoprevAnyone know what the persistent design flaw is? (Or are dehumidifiers intrinsically a fire risk for some reason?) reply jandrese 19 hours agoparentI think the primary design flaw is that they&#x27;re built by the cheapest race-to-the-bottom manufacturer that cuts corners whenever possible. Advice like \"make sure to only buy a quality one\" may be useless if all of the quality manufacturers exited the business decades ago, unable to compete with the cheap flammable garbage that people were actually buying. Note how many formerly reputable brand names are on this list. The companies are hollow shells of their former selves, all buying the same cut rate hardware from some no-name overseas manufacturer and slapping their plastic over it. reply samsolomon 15 hours agorootparentThere are some reliable manufactures, but the cost is significantly different. I had someone come out and give me a quote for an AprilAire dehumidifier system. The dehumidifier was $2,000, plus $1,000 installation. But they also needed an electrician to expand our circuit breaker.I ended up going to Home Depot and buying a well-reviewed GE dehumidifier with a pump. Luckily it&#x27;s not on this list. I&#x27;d rather have the AprilAire system, but $5,000 vs $400 was too much of a difference. I could replace the cheap one every a year for over a decade for the same price. reply ClumsyPilot 2 hours agorootparentThe problem is not just cost, it’s how do I know that this more expensive device is better made reply nomel 20 hours agoparentprev> Or are dehumidifiers intrinsically a fire risk for some reason?A dehumidifier has the same guts as an air conditioner, because an air conditioner was an invented by directing air over a dehumidifier [1]. So, it&#x27;s not related to the \"dehumidifierness\" of it.It&#x27;s almost certainly the same factory, in China, sourcing the same faulty components.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sunsethc.com&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;the-astonishing-hist... reply smileysteve 19 hours agoparentprevLikely a lack of thermal shutoff switch; So if it runs too long, the compressor fails, or the working fluid loses pressure then the compressor doesn&#x27;t shut off. reply greggsy 20 hours agoparentprevI wonder if there is a static issue if they make the space too dry? reply bluGill 17 hours agorootparentMaybe, but most have cut offs for when the humidity gets to normal levels. Even if they don&#x27;t have that, they become less efficient at removing water when there is less in the air, so you would need a tiny space to get that low (the heat they produce would start a fire first) reply smileysteve 19 hours agorootparentprevunlikely. reply bob1029 20 hours agoprevIf humidity is a serious problem you could consider getting a proper central unit installed. A lot of new construction in the Gulf Coast region is including these in the HVAC systems. It&#x27;s like a mini 1&#x2F;4 ton A&#x2F;C system inside your system. I had one that came w&#x2F; the house but it didn&#x27;t last very long (Honeywell). Replaced it with an Aprilaire unit.I can tell when my dehumidifier is off or not working because I&#x27;ll see really bad condensation forming around registers. Keeping RH below 55% is an extreme battle this time of year. My dehumidifier runs 24&#x2F;7 for about 9 months of the year and the main heat pump runs about 80-85% of the day. reply bluGill 20 hours agoparentThese cost $150. A cheap DIY minisplit is over $1000 (double that if you get one that doesn&#x27;t need a vacuum). I&#x27;d love to have the minisplit HVAC in my shed, but cost drives me away. reply pxx 19 hours agorootparentUh, they&#x27;re like $650 minus 30% tax credit. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.highseer.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;9-000-btu-ductless-dc-inve...Sure, yeah, double it if you want the pre-charged lines. But I found that installing the lines that required a vacuum to be easier than using the precharged lines (as you don&#x27;t need to be as careful with the lines before you release the charge into them).Regardless though the minisplit (or central A&#x2F;C) isn&#x27;t a good substitute for a dedicated dehumidifier. You&#x27;re not going to get the RH very low. reply bluGill 18 hours agorootparentthat is cheaper than the last time I priced them by a bit. I&#x27;ll have to save that link, thanks. Though after shipping things are a lot closer (I suppose since others have free shipping they have to up the price) reply zainhoda 19 hours agorootparentprevIn addition to the minisplit cost, there&#x27;s also the cost of the electrical work. Anyone can plug in a dehumidifier into an outlet but drilling a hole into the wall, running the linesets and communication wires for a minisplit is beyond most people&#x27;s comfort level. reply ClumsyPilot 2 hours agorootparentprevIf you rent, that’s not an option. I would happily pay, but the landlord lives in a tax heaven and doesn’t do anything, not sure if he is even a real person. reply fullstop 18 hours agoparentprevI imagine that most dehumidifiers are in basements which are not typically climate controlled. reply c64d81744074dfa 13 hours agoprevMy dehumidifier isn&#x27;t on the list but I believe maybe it should be. Several times now it gets into a state where it&#x27;s very loud, abnormally hot and it turns out the compressor is stuck ON even though the fan is not running. Even powering it down (with the button) will not turn off the compressor.Unplugging it and plugging back in will sometimes fix the problem. Looked into it and it turns out the power relay is getting stuck in the on position. I have to open the dehumidifier completely to get access to the relay and then tap on it with something hard. This has worked to unstick it, at least so far.I think maybe this relay isn&#x27;t up to its task. I was curious about replacing it with something similar but couldn&#x27;t find anything remotely as small for switching 120 VAC mains power.For reference, my dehumidifer is a Toshiba TDDP7011ES2. The relay in question is a Sanyou SFK-112DMP.I dunno, maybe this will help someone out there figure out what&#x27;s going on. reply altairprime 13 hours agoparentCall the CPSC and tell them what&#x27;s happening — specifically, that the compressor is overheating due to a stuck relay — and ask them if your model is included in the recall, or if not, if the recall involves stuck power relays.They will, of course, warn you that your dehumidifier could overheat and kill you, which is completely valid. You should stop using it immediately. Accept that going into the call, or else they&#x27;ll take a lot of time trying to convince you.But they will also have more details about how, exactly, the dehumidifiers fail, and they&#x27;ll have more leverage to pursue your concern about a design defect problem with Toshiba. reply c64d81744074dfa 12 hours agorootparentThanks for the advice, I will try that. reply tmaly 14 hours agoprevIt amazes me that there is no way to really get the word out about this recall.I was lucky to see it on HN. I run a dehumidifier almost constantly during the months of May to October to maintain humidity for a piano. reply SamuelAdams 13 hours agoparentThis could be a good angle for Amazon and other online retailers - automated recall alerts based on products you purchase. reply kalleboo 7 hours agorootparentI have received a recall notice in the past from Amazon for something I bought there. reply ygs 11 hours agorootparentprevShameless plug - site: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;recalls.me - It aggregates recalls from all USA agencies and you can register to get alerts! reply rcarr 18 hours agoprevI recently read that dehumidifiers can essentially serve in place of a tumble dryer but with vastly reduced energy costs. You simply hang your washed clothes in the same room as the dehumidifier and it speeds up the drying process by quite a lot. Think I will purchase one eventually. reply primenum 3 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve been doing it for years. The only con is more dust :) reply skinner927 17 hours agoparentprevI put a small one in my laundry room because it was a little musty with the front loader having to dry out and the door to the room being closed all the time. It drains right into the sink and the room. I highly suggest it. reply thebruce87m 18 hours agoparentprevWe do this. Desiccant based ones are quieter. I can sleep with one in the next room, unlike the compressor ones I’ve had. reply convolvatron 17 hours agoparentprevI used to do this. It takes about 2 hrs for linens and nearly a full day for terrycloth. if you&#x27;re not in a hurry its fine. reply Sunspark 15 hours agoprevYou know what sucks about dehumidifiers these days?In the past, they had a feature where you could cycle them 4-hours-on, 4-hours-off.. not anymore, now it&#x27;s either sensor, continuous on, or run for an interval then shut off and stay off.To answer the question why not use sensor?They advertise +-5% accuracy on the humidity meter.. except on my current model it is WILDLY inaccurate. I calibrated an analog dial myself and the sensor shows there&#x27;s a +30% reading difference between the machine and the dial.. no wonder it was never running.. reply crazygringo 15 hours agoparentThey do use a sensor. E.g. the bestselling dehumidifier on Amazon (HomeLabs) does exactly that. Same as Frigidaire, etc. Mine seems to cycle on&#x2F;off about 8-10 times per hour -- it turns off when humidity reaches 5 percentage points above its set point, and turns off once it reaches 5 percentage points below.I&#x27;ve had humidifiers&#x2F;dehumidifiers in the past that have been off by 20 to 30 percentage points of humidity, but honestly that was never really a problem, because I just set the target off by the same amount. Also it really helps if you have fans circulating the air -- especially with ultrasonic humidifiers, it can easily humidify the nearby air by 20-30 percentage points and turn off, because local humidity really has gone up, but it hasn&#x27;t spread throughout the room. reply Sunspark 14 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t change the target by the same amount because the lowest I can set the machine I currently have is 30%. Except 30% on that is 70%+ in actuality. So that means it will turn on for 75-80%. That&#x27;s way too high. If it let me turn it to 0% or 5% then that would be fine. reply crazygringo 13 hours agorootparentOh yikes. Then that&#x27;s definitely not in the \"miscalibrated\" range, that&#x27;s just totally broken.And while humidifiers can suffer from moisture buildup next to the sensor which you can fix in a couple of minutes with a handheld fan, that shouldn&#x27;t be the case with dehumidifiers.Sorry but it sounds like you just need to get a new one. Hopefully it&#x27;s still under warranty. Your unit isn&#x27;t representative of what&#x27;s being sold these days, it&#x27;s just flat-out defective.(I assumed you were talking about a difference of 15-20 percentage points, which is more common to see, although more in humidifiers than in dehumidifiers.) reply cab404 18 hours agoprevdehumidifier that caught fire is actually quite an effective way to dehumidify, shouldn&#x27;t even use that much electricity reply jpm_sd 20 hours agoprevSo what do I do, if I have a closely-related product that isn&#x27;t on the list?

It would be good to know what the risk level is. reply cududa 19 hours agorootparentSame one I have reply bluGill 20 hours agoparentprevFor now you can keep using it, but keep watch as who knows if that will be recalled later.Or if you don&#x27;t want it find someone who has a recalled unit and trade. reply jandrese 19 hours agorootparentMaybe keep it away from anything flammable if at all possible. reply CamperBob2 15 hours agoparentprevSame model here. Anyone know how to look up the details that prompted the recall? Seems like there would be a technical filing at CPSC or elsewhere. reply gunapologist99 18 hours agoprevUse hanging bags like you&#x27;d use on a yacht instead; no risk of fire at all.Search for \"hanging bag moisture absorber\" on your favorite shopping site. reply toast0 18 hours agoparentThe problem is you&#x27;ve got to then remove the humidity from the absorbers somehow. Whereas my dehumidifier pumps the water it collects outside the humid area; mine fills its catch basin in under a day when the pump isn&#x27;t enabled or isn&#x27;t working (grr). I&#x27;d wonder about capacity of those moisture absorbers too, but I guess you can always put a ton of them. reply fullstop 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve had the occasional slime growth which clogs the drip line. I connect a shop-vac to the hose connection and schloop it out.It does disturb me that stuff sometimes grows in there, though. reply toast0 18 hours agorootparentWell, lots of airflow, lots of water, fairly warm; slime growth 101 right there. I did find the line blocked, and trimmed it back to a more approriate length that seemed unconstricted. Shop-vac is a good idea. I also need to see if there&#x27;s a pre-pump filter or something that needs cleaning. reply rsingel 20 hours agoprevFound we have one these. Glad The Verge covered this reply zarzavat 12 hours agoprevDoes anyone know if dehumidifiers sold in Europe (UK) in the last 10 years are also dangerous? It’s concerning when you see such a large number of products in a category being recalled. reply dvh 20 hours agoprevCPSC evaluated the recalled dehumidifiers and found that they can overheat, smoke, and catch fire reply MarkusWandel 20 hours agoprevI have one of these, I think (will have to check the nameplate). It was given to me. How would a refund work here? Is there some standard sum involved, or do I need evidence of what was paid for the unit originally? I don&#x27;t have this. reply emdashcomma 20 hours agoparentIn my case, I had to take a picture that showed all of my name (on a piece of paper), the model number on the back, and the power cord having been cut. I submitted this and maybe a month later I got a check in the mail. I didn&#x27;t buy the unit; it was already in my house when I moved in. reply topspin 19 hours agoprevGreat how almost all of them are \"UL Listed\".Having looked due to this headline I notice Toshiba is absent from this and previous dehumidifier recall episodes. reply miguelazo 19 hours agoparentAlso certainly were \"Amazon&#x27;s Choice\" products. reply ikekkdcjkfke 17 hours agoprevIf anyone has one of these it might be smart to set it at a humidity percent where it&#x27;s not running all the time. reply nikau 14 hours agoprevWhat ever happened to embedding a 2 cent thermal fuses in products like this? reply nullc 13 hours agoprevI have a GE dehumidifier whose model doesn&#x27;t appear to be on this list-- but it doesn&#x27;t matter much: I found it almost completely useless, it ran constantly while removing fairly little water. I replaced it with a desiccant based dehumidifier and found it worked much better, removing much more water per unit time and unit energy.The effectiveness of heat exchanger dehumidifiers falls off very rapidly at lower temperatures, which was exactly when mine needed to run. At lower temps desiccant dehumidifiers work much better.The GE dumidifier also vibrated the storage container at levels that were audible hundreds of feet away... while the desiccant is essentially silent except for the polite white noise of the air moving through it. reply jrm4 19 hours agoprevKeep it real:This is why we absolutely DO need a reliable \"twitter.\"Mastodon&#x27;s the right model for this; companies and governments (and safety orgs) need to go ahead and set up their servers and run these things.This is one of these things that&#x27;s painfully obvious to me and I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s not more of a push for it.Even the BIG COMPANIES benefit; this model would have prevented the \"Eli Lilly\" thing. reply kelnos 19 hours agoparentHow does having a reliable twitter-like service help? I can think of a few ways this could work:1. Government&#x2F;regulator-run account that publishes a message for every product recall.2. Each manufacturer is required to run an account that is only for recall announcements.3. Each manufacturer is required to run a separate account for every product they ship that is only for recall announcements for that particular product.All of these suffer from problems that I think make them infeasible.#1 is probably the easiest to get people to subscribe to (since they only have to do it once), but then any announcement for a product they own is drowned in all the noise from products they don&#x27;t care about.#2 is perhaps the worst of both worlds: customers have to remember to subscribe when they buy a product from a manufacturer they haven&#x27;t bought from before (though at least they don&#x27;t have to re-subscribe for successive products from that manufacturer). But same problem as in #1 where they will likely miss announcements related to their product, since there will be announcements for a bunch of other products too.#3 is the best from a signal-to-noise ratio perspective, but I don&#x27;t see a lot of customers remembering to subscribe to a new recall feed every time they buy a new product.The only way to ensure that people get notified when they&#x27;ve bought products that are later determined to be dangerous is to somehow require that the point-of-sale process includes product registration. But that&#x27;s terrible from a privacy perspective, among other things. reply cududa 18 hours agorootparentI posted about the recall on Twitter, and a buddy found his in the 2013 recall. He registered it with GE and was never notified. reply CamperBob2 15 hours agoparentprevAbsolutely. What governments use Twitter for is too important to be left up to the erratic people running Twitter.Especially when anonymous users are prevented from participating or even seeing follow-up information, as is the case now.I don&#x27;t know much about Mastodon or have an opinion regarding whether it should be used, but I agree that relying on Twitter to disseminate official information is unacceptable. The well has been irrevocably poisoned. reply sbjs 20 hours agoprev> Have you seen these dehumidifiers? Stop using them or you might die.I always think this is a funny way to word it. I mean, you&#x27;re going to die either way. At the most, stopping using them might push it back further. But a car crash might even the playing field too. I think implicitly accepting language like this often indicates that a person isn&#x27;t accepting the fact of the bigger picture. reply cududa 19 hours agoparentBro, nobody that has ever used the phrase “you might die because xyz” has ever been under the assumption that they won’t die one day.“Often indicates that a person isn’t accepting the fact of the bigger picture”It indicates nothing.

In a filing to the Manhattan bankruptcy court, the firm sought recognition of restructuring talks underway in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. The world’s most indebted property developer defaulted in 2021 and announced an offshore debt restructuring program in March. A residential complex constructed by Evergrande in Huai’an, Jiangsu, China, on July 20, 2023. Future PublishingFuture PublishingGetty Images China’s heavily indebted property giant Evergrande Group on Thursday filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court. In a filing with the Manhattan bankruptcy court, the company referenced restructuring proceedings in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. In a separate statement, Evergrande on Friday said that it will ask the U.S. court for “recognition of the schemes of arrangement under the offshore debt restructuring for Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands.” It added, “The application is a normal procedure for the offshore debt restructuring and does not involve bankruptcy petition.” The world’s most indebted property developer defaulted in 2021 and announced an offshore debt restructuring program in March. Trading of Evergrande shares have been suspended since March 2022. Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection allows a U.S. bankruptcy court to intervene in cross-border insolvency case involving foreign companies that are undergoing restructuring from creditors. It aims to protect the debtors’ assets and facilitate the rescue of businesses that are in financial trouble. Tianji Holdings, an affiliate of Evergrande, and its subsidiary, Scenery Journey, also filed for Chapter 15 protection in Manhattan bankruptcy court, according to the filing. Property sector fallout Evergrande’s filing comes amid contagion fears that China’s property sector troubles could spill over to other parts of the economy, which has already seen faltering growth. Most recently, Country Garden, which used to be one of China’s largest developers, struggled to make coupon payments on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and issued a profit warning. The firm has also suspended trading in at least 10 of its mainland China-traded yuan bonds, according to Reuters. WATCH NOW VIDEO08:54 Chinese property giant Evergrande has a big debt problem – here’s why it matters China’s massive real estate sector has long been a vital engine of growth for the world’s second-largest economy, and accounts for as much as 30% of the country’s gross domestic product. Despite recent policy signals, investor worries linger. In late July, its top leaders indicated a shift toward greater support for the property sector, paving the way for local governments to implement specific policies. In July, Evergrande posted a combined loss of $81 billion over the past two years, after struggling to finish projects and repay suppliers and lenders. Net losses for 2021 and 2022 were 476 billion yuan ($66.36 billion) and 105.9 billion yuan ($14.76 billion), respectively, as a result of property write-downs, return of lands, losses on financial assets and financing costs, the company said. The bankruptcy filing was signed by Jimmy Fong, who listed himself as a “foreign representative” of China Evergrande Group. A “scheme creditors” meeting is set for Wednesday at the Hong Kong office of Sidley Austin, the U.S.-based law firm representing Evergrande, the petition added. — CNBC’s Evelyn Cheng and Elliot Smith contributed to this story.

In China, the strategy often involves allowing such companies to default in a controlled manner. Given that the major lenders and banks are state-owned , this essentially means that the government bears the loss through these institutions (what else can happen anyway??) . Asset management companies are then allowed to bid for any remaining valuable assets of the failed company. The state government has also issued directives to local governments, ensuring they take responsibility for the completion of housing projects for homebuyers.It&#x27;s clear that there have been instances of questionable financial maneuvering by individuals behind these real estate companies, involving substantial sums of money being moved out of China through various, potentially illicit means. In Evergrande&#x27;s case, critics point to dubious ventures, such as an automotive business that never produced cars, as potential vehicles for siphoning money to overseas entities. Additionally, the issuance of USD-denominated bonds—often purchased by shareholders—is another strategy that has been scrutinized.To address these challenges, the Chinese government has enforced exit bans and placed these individuals under strict supervision. They are often required to return these funds to China, potentially under threat of reduced prison sentences. This sounds not right... but yeah... it is China. And China does not have other means to use like US to extradite fugitives or request the money back even it got all the evidence... exit-ban and blackmailing are the only way China can go...As for Evergrande, while it&#x27;s severely distressed, it continues to operate, largely as a &#x27;zombie&#x27; company under state guidance, to resolve as much of its outstanding debt and obligations as possible. A full government bailout, in the Western sense, does not appear to be on the table.Regarding the broader crisis, I feel the situation is largely controllable due to the extensive tools at the disposal of the Chinese government. It&#x27;s almost certain that the authorities have already devised a comprehensive plan and roadmap to navigate this crisis 1-2 years ago... reply paxys 58 minutes agoparentYou are sharing the official written policy, but the reality on the ground is very different in China. Most business happens under the table. Corruption and bribes are commonplace in every transaction. Books are all fudged to a high degree. Millions of people who put up large deposits and made monthly payments for under construction houses to developers like Evergrande are never getting anything back, and laws aren&#x27;t going to help them. The central government has a tight grasp on maintaining its control but not much else. That&#x27;s just how things work in China. reply bradleyjg 2 hours agoparentprevTo address these challenges, the Chinese government has enforced exit bans and placed these individuals under strict supervision.

These guys knew what game they were playing. They could have not tried to scam the Chinese government in order to build a foreign fortune and live abroad as kleptocrats. reply wenyuanyu 1 hour agorootparentTo me, the use of exit bans and coercive measures to bring fugitives back to China does not seem unreasonable under specific circumstances. While employing these tactics for political reasons would be problematic, they serve as some of the only tools available to the Chinese government to act against corruption and embezzlement. These measures provide leverage and serve as a deterrent to prevent corrupt officials from fleeing China with substantial illicit gains [0].This approach is not a secret; it is well-publicized within China and internationally. For example, the BBC reported on China&#x27;s \"Fox Hunt\" operation in 2014, although the tone of the reporting has notably changed over time [1][2].Despite China&#x27;s extensive global connections, it faces significant legal constraints in its efforts to establish extradition treaties with major countries. Given the current international political climate, the prospects of forming such treaties appear to be minimal. In this context, what other options does China have at its disposal to combat corruption and hold individuals accountable?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Fox_Hunt [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-asia-30358060 [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-northern-ireland-65537553 reply seanmcdirmid 31 minutes agorootparentTransparency would help out a lot. Allowing the press to actually investigate and report on things, and not trying to suppress information that allows corruption to thrive. Also, there are no power branch checks, the judicial branch is at the mercy of the official branch, and the legislative branch is just to rubber-stamp things.

You might also have to act in the spirit of the law (as interpreted by the CCP) to be sure to not become the target of the justice system.This is very different from the western system. But I think most people would agree that sometimes complete \"rule of law\" can also lead to perverse outcomes where very immoral business behaviours go unpunished. reply nradov 48 minutes agorootparentprevThe other option that China has at its disposal is to introduce multiparty democracy with the rule of law and guarantees of civil rights.

Where the treasury and&#x2F;or Fed step in to oversee acquisitions and provide loan guarantees? reply fnordpiglet 40 minutes agoparentprevIt’s interesting we hear the terms “bail out” when connected with how the US managed major institutional collapse. However from what I experienced on the street during these “bail outs,” Lehman, Bear, SVB, First Republic no longer exist. Their assets were salvaged and remaining functional assets acquired. The fed, treasury, and other institutions involved in the bailout ended up making handsome profits from the reperformance of the distressed assets they pulled into their balance sheets.The only bail out was for the global participants, not just banks but everyone with an asset that depends on the orderly function of the financial system even during periods of distress. “Tax payers” paid nothing, and benefited from the recovery from the disorderly Lehman collapse and the credit squeeze that caused. There’s a lot of speculation that the relatively mild inflation the US experienced post pandemic was due to all the QE and other moves the government and governmental bodies did, as well as pandemic stimulus. I’ve yet to see the effects clearly disentangled from the systemic breakdown of logistics during the pandemic which have only fairly recently ironed out. Certainly all the cheap cash caused some inflation, but what a small price to pay compared to what everyone faced.I think the issue with the situation in China is the assets held by these investment vehicles are never going to reperform. They’re piles of paper and empty buildings rotting with no present or future purpose. They’ve sucked up immense amounts of public money passed through the system in various ways into fake investments, and their value will simply evaporate leaving behind a desperate situation - cities and town throughout China burdened with useless infrastructure. It’s been brewing since at least 2007. But it doesn’t start and end with real estate - there are enormous infrastructure projects and bad international loans sprawling the planet that under scrutiny won’t stand up. Chinese credit spreads, where they are priceable, will have to blow up, and where they aren’t the opaque risks will sew structural and systemic lack of confidence.I hope China can navigate whatever unwinding has to happen, and I sincerely hope it doesn’t devolve into political and social instability fueling geopolitical strawman conflicts to distract from domestic problems. While I really wish China could find a way to let its people be actually free, I don’t think a multipolar world is necessarily a bad thing. An ascendant China as more than a factory floor for the west provides a good opportunity for trade and competition, spurring growth and innovation everywhere. reply geysersam 9 minutes agorootparent> There’s a lot of speculation that the relatively mild inflation the US experienced post pandemic was due to all the QE and other moves the government and governmental bodies did, as well as pandemic stimulus.How would stimulus and QE help prevent inflation?

It would be one thing if most of these buildings were occupied by residents and only a percentage was investment properties but it sounds like there were many buildings in these new cities where practically every unit was an \"investment property\".

This is also why it can make sense to pay the bank in real estate. The bank doesn&#x27;t need to sell it immediately because they don&#x27;t need to pay a mortgage so they can just sit on it and collect rental income until they can find a buyer.Another alternative is for the real estate trust to sell new shares into the market and use the money to pay the bank, or pay the bank in new shares.

Further, each 1T RMB is 137B USD. How many companies in the whole world carry more than this much debt? Let alone Chine property developers?

Assuming lenders will have to take some haircut the no. is big but not something that will break the economy!! am I missing some nos.? reply OtherShrezzing 5 hours agorootparentThe lenders in the Chinese housing market are mostly Chinese citizens. In modern China, rather than buying a house, you buy a promise of a house, then the house builder builds it for you. The house builders though have these huge debts, and they&#x27;ve been using money from new purchases to construct their backlog of homes.The $90bn outstanding is $90bn in outstanding housing construction, not just abstract debts to banks which could be written off or bailed out. Citizens will need to continue paying their mortgages on houses that don&#x27;t (and won&#x27;t) exist, which will cause some civil disquiet. Construction companies are going to have a shortfall of $90bn worth of work in their pipelines, which will mean mass layoffs. Entire large towns will go unbuilt.Evergrande isn&#x27;t the only one in this situation, it looks like a handful of large house-builders also have these uncompleted backlogs being paid for with new orders. The collapse of one might prompt the collapse of the others. As house-buyers become less confident that their house will ever exist, they&#x27;ll stop buying new stock. When they stop buying new stock, the other house-builders collapse under the burden of their backlog of construction projects. reply tremon 4 hours agorootparentThat sounds suspiciously like a pyramid scheme: the only thing financing the current construction are payments to new construction. How did they get into this situation? By continuously selling under cost, or perhaps by siphoning off profits? reply reisse 3 hours agorootparentThe way OP described it, yes, it sounds like a ponzi, but in reality it&#x27;s more like crowdfunding. First, the developer takes credit from a bank and uses own money to buy a land. Then, in order to start construction, the developer sells what is basically an obligation to build real estate and transfer the rights to buyer. These obligations are obviously cheaper than the expected price of real estate in the future, and also cheaper than already-constructed real estate now. The developer does not sell all the future real estate at once, because as the time goes by, and construction comes closer to a finish, the obligations become more expensive - it sells only the amount necessary to fund the next step of construction. After the construction is finished, developer sells leftover real estate with a markup big enough to finance its next project.When the housing market is good, this scheme brings real estate costs down, because you can buy cheaper \"not-yet-build\" flats or houses, and the developer can seek funding without overpaying on the bank loans. But if the housing market tanks, the development freezes, and the first buyers take a loss. I don&#x27;t know about China, but in some countries such obligations are mandatory insured from the default, so people can get at least some of their money back. In others buyers are left with a piece of land with unfinished building. reply NhanH 4 hours agorootparentprevLand price keeps increasing caused this problem.

It&#x27;s not that they sell the property for less than the relevant land cost, it&#x27;s that the increase is too steep that they can&#x27;t buy and build the next one without pre-selling the lot, the company just doesn&#x27;t have enough cash. reply jjoonathan 24 minutes agorootparentThe magnitude of land speculation profits is not dictated by physics. If companies weren&#x27;t able to pay what they did, the speculators (local governments in this case?) would live with less.Developers compete with each other, so they will always take as much leverage as allowed, but the rules are adjustable by lenders. Lenders compete too, but they usually wind up backed by a central bank or other political entity, and that&#x27;s the point at which changes can actually be made. Of course, there is no guarantee these changes won&#x27;t create problems (Three Red Lines were a decade too late) but they can be made. replybombcar 4 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds ponzi schemic. reply bobthepanda 5 hours agorootparentprevOne is that apparently a bunch of suppliers and contractors for their projects have not been paid for a while, so those will default or go bankrupt as well, and cascade further down the economy.The other thing is that Evergrande sold mostly through presales so now there are all those paid for but unfinished apartment blocks. reply misja111 1 hour agorootparentprev> .. and 1.7 trillion Yuan in assetsNote that this is the book value.

Russia at least, is a good example of the opposite: give people chance to earn and invest money and enrich themselves and they will give no shit about even the most ridiculous things government does.Soviet Union has collapsed while having whole lot more economic power and raw output of just about every industry, and was much more up to date technologically, but it deprived people of their basic instinct: to save and invest money and grow rich. Today&#x27;s Russia allows and encourages that. Moreover, it even allows people say, to blatantly ignore taxes on all levels (i know people who make millions bucks per year in Russia and they don&#x27;t know what tax number is, receiving and spending money through the banks in the open - and banks even help then when they need to make that money look legit abroad). As long as you don&#x27;t try to oppose the great Pu or mess with politics overall, the regime has nothing against people enriching themselves - so the support base is rock solid and need for violence to maintain internal order is next to nonexistent.Russia isn&#x27;t democratic, but it is capitalist in the sense: you can own capital and government wants you to, and sees people who have capital as by default more well-behaved and loyal than those who don&#x27;t.

At that point, it&#x27;s a tribal opinion that was arrived at through emotional means, not logical means. reply AnthonyMouse 5 hours agorootparentBetter yet, sometimes that is what it is. For example, it&#x27;s plausible that cost disease is largely a result of government regulation, but it&#x27;s not a result of a specific government regulation, it&#x27;s a result of the total number of regulations increasing over time like a ratchet when each one adds another tick to the cost of doing business. reply hackerlight 5 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s plausible that cost disease is largely a result of government regulation, but it&#x27;s not a result of a specific government regulationYes, but each individual regulation that is contributing to this aggregate cost disease has varying degrees of value. Even if a specific regulation contributes +1 to the overall cost disease, it may also contribute +2 of positive value elsewhere that makes it net worthwhile, all things considered.So we&#x27;re back to where we started. Each distinct thing needs to be considered on its own merits without trying to automatically judge it based on what category it belongs to.Aside from that, I could not agree more with your overall view. It&#x27;s a good distillation of the broader concept of thinking things through from first principles. I don&#x27;t want more or less regulations. I want more good regulations, and less bad regulations. In some areas (e.g. carbon emissions), I only want more regulations. In other areas (e.g. housing construction), I only want less regulations. I think these conclusions come from starting with the desired end goal (e.g. less pollution) and working backwards. Many people wrongly start with an ideology (e.g. regulations are good) and work forwards from that. reply AnthonyMouse 4 hours agorootparent> Even if a specific regulation contributes +1 to the overall cost disease, it may also contribute +2 of positive value elsewhere that makes it net worthwhile, all things considered.That&#x27;s assuming they&#x27;re not in competition for scarce resources, which they are.For example, it&#x27;s more efficient to do something with fewer people than to do the same thing with more people. Not just for the directly proportional efficiency reason, but because larger teams have higher coordination costs and management overhead, and will tend to increase average entity size leading to market consolidation which is very bad.So you get a certain regulatory budget before your regulations induce the regulated entity to increase the size of the team. At which point your regulation that was contributing +1 cost to achieve +2 benefit would then contribute +25001 cost to achieve +2 benefit. (This is especially true for regulations that apply to small entities, because the cost of increasing the number of workers from 1 to 2 is drastic, often to the point of destroying the business.)Which means you have to start throwing out regulations that in isolation have +1 cost and +2 benefit so you have the budget left for the regulations that have +1 cost and +10 benefit. reply lordnacho 4 hours agorootparentprevI try to avoid terms like capitalism and socialism.

A fertility rate of \"N\" means the next generation will be \"N&#x2F;2\" times as large as the one before it. Because of this you can easily model what a society, composed of successive generations of a fixed fertility rate, would look like. To keep things simple, imagine everybody gives birth to all their kids at 20. When they actually do doesn&#x27;t matter, it would always converge on the same ratios:----Fertility Rate of 2 (average age = 40): 100 80-year-olds, 100 60-year-olds, 100 40-year-olds, 100 20-year-olds, 100 newborns.Fertility Rate of 1 (average age = 63): 100 80-year-olds, 50 60-year-olds, 25 40-year-olds, 12 20-year-olds, 6 newbornsFertility rate of 0.5 (average age = 74): 100 80-year-olds, 25 60-year-olds, 6 40-year-olds, 1 20-year-olds, 0 newborns----You can also estimate the ongoing population rate of change for each fertility group by removing the elderly generation, adding a newborn generation, and contrasting the new population sizes:----Fertility Rate of 2: 500->500 = 0% population change per 20 yearsFertility Rate of 1: 193->96 = 50% population decline per 20 yearsFertility Rate of 0.5: 132->32 = 76% population decline per 20 years----In the developed world most fertility rates plummeted around 1970.

A stable practical fertility rate is 2.1. South Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world, below 0.8, and there was no government meddling there. The US fertility rate is also plummeting and now down to below 1.7 and heavily biased by income. The birth rate for households earning$200,000 [1] with a near perfect linear relationship for incomes in between. And obviously there are way more poor households than &#x27;rich.&#x27;It&#x27;s so odd to me that of the many issues people freak out about, this one ranks relatively low. We&#x27;re looking at a non-speculative and entirely real demographic collapse of the entire developed world, in quite rapid order. For those who may not appreciate the impact, a total fertility rate of \"N\" means you will trend towards a system where the population of one older generation will be \"2&#x2F;N\" times larger than the next younger generation.So if you have a fertility rate of 2, each generation will be exactly the same. If you have a fertility rate of 1 then each older generation will be exactly twice as large as the next younger generation. So, for a simple model, imagine we all gave birth at 20.

    "originBody": "Learn API Docs Blog 2023 January 3 Announcing turmoil 2022 November 25 Announcing axum 0.6.0 October 27 Announcing async-backtrace August 23 What's new in axum 0.6.0-rc.1 March 31 What's new in axum 0.5 February 18 Announcing Tokio Metrics 0.1 More Blog Posts Announcing turmoil January 3, 2023 Today, we are happy to announce the initial release of turmoil, a framework for developing and testing distributed systems. Testing distributed systems is hard. Non-determinism is everywhere (network, time, threads, etc.), making reproducible results difficult to achieve. Development cycles are lengthy due to deployments. All these factors slow down development and make it difficult to ensure system correctness. turmoil strives to solve these problems by simulating hosts, time and the network. This allows for an entire distributed system to run within a single process on a single thread, achieving deterministic execution. We also provide fine grain control over the network, with support for dropping, holding and delaying messages between hosts. Getting Started To use turmoil, add the crate to your Cargo.toml file: [dev-dependencies] turmoil = \"0.3\" Similar to loom, we provide simulated networking types that mirror tokio::net. Define a new module in your crate named net or any other name of your choosing. In this module, list out the types that need to be toggled between turmoil and tokio::net: #[cfg(not(feature = \"turmoil\"))] pub use tokio::net::*; #[cfg(feature = \"turmoil\")] pub use turmoil::net::*; Then, write your software using networking types from this local module. #[cfg(feature = \"turmoil\")] mod simulation { #[test] fn simulate_it() -> turmoil::Result { // build the simulation let mut sim = turmoil::Builder::new().build(); // setup a host sim.host(\"server\", || async move { // host software goes here }); // setup the test sim.client(\"test\", async move { // dns lookup for \"server\" let addr = turmoil::lookup(\"server\"); // test code goes here Ok(()) }); // run the simulation sim.run() } } Each host (including the test code) runs on its own Runtime, which is managed by the simulation. Within run(), the simulation steps each runtime a configurable duration until the test code completes. What's next? This crate is still experimental. Your use cases and feedback are invaluable in guiding our development. Please file issues and ping us on Discord in #turmoil-simulation. Happy testing! — Brett McChesney (@mcches) Announcing axum 0.6.0 Get Help: Edit this page Announcing turmoil Getting Started What's next?",

When it works, it&#x27;s great. A pattern I&#x27;ve been following is to have a single fixture that returns a simulation of the system under a standard configuration, for example N replicas of an atomic register, so that each test looks like: 1. Modify the simulation with something like`turmoil::hold(\"client\", \"replica-1\")`. 2. Submit a request to the server. 3. Make an assertion about either the response, or the state of the simulation once the request has been made. For example, if only some replicas are faulty, the request should succeed, but if too many replicas are faulty, the request &#x2F; simulation should time-out.One of the things I have found difficut is that when a test fails, it can be hard to tell if my code is wrong, or if I am using Turmoil incorrectly. I&#x27;ve had to do some deep-dives into the source in order to fully understand what happens, as the behavior sometimes doesn&#x27;t line-up with my understanding of the documentation.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kaymanb&#x2F;todc&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;todc-net reply mcches 21 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s great to hear that you&#x27;ve been using turmoil for this type of work. I&#x27;m one of the authors and we&#x27;d love to hear about your experience and what we can do improve things. Either a github issue or reaching out on discord works great.We&#x27;ve discussed improving the tracing experience, and even adding visualizations, but it hasn&#x27;t been prioritized yet. reply exfalso 6 hours agoprevOn first read this looks almost completely useless for actual distributed systems.So first off, distributed systems use different software for different tasks. These will not be&#x2F;were not written in Rust, and even if they were, they may not use Tokio (which is a library I could go into a rant about as well...).Second, the very premise of the library, namely that it simulates the components and serializes everything into a single deterministic thread, is already wrong. Distributed system issues are difficult because they are non-deterministic, the faults happen rarely, and they exhibit Heisenbug behaviour: the more diagnostic you add to the system, the more likely you are to serialize the event sand therefore hide the bug. This library starts off with serialization, effectively hiding most if not all issues that can happen in a real system. What is the point of this?So how would an actually useful distributed testing framework look like? It would be almost the exact opposite of turmoil: 1. It would handle an actual distributed system with different components written in different languages 2. It would inject payloads that are likely to tease out races&#x2F;consistency violations 3. It would inject failures at various layers (network, storage etc) to test how the system recovers 4. It would provide useful diagnostics, and a way to reduce the failure scenarios to the extent possible (again, we&#x27;re talking about non-deterministic failures, so this is not easy) reply sagarm 2 minutes agoparent> distributed systems use different software for different tasks. These will not be&#x2F;were not written in Rust,Obviously, that&#x27;s not always true. Having a way to do deterministic testing in a single process is helpful.> Distributed system issues are difficult because they are non-deterministic, the faults happen rarely,You do not want non-determinism in your tests just because the real world non-determinism. How else are you going to write repeatable tests of scenarios involving concurrency?You can build fuzzing on top of a deterministic simulator, allowing you to reproduce failures.

It requires a little bit of setup to ensure all components that typically run on separate machines can run in a single process, and inter-process communication happens through interfaces that can be stubbed out during testing.I designed a series of workshops to teach these ideas internally at Microsoft. You can find the source code used in the workshop at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;coyote-workshop - the repo can use better README files but sharing it nonetheless in case the setup helps inspire your own use of Coyote. reply tveita 18 hours agoprevFoundationDB has published some informative content on how they test their actor based distributed system in C++, might be worth a watch for inspiration.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4fFDFbi3toc reply Fiahil 21 hours agoprevSee Also: Loom (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tokio-rs&#x2F;loom), a concurrency permutation testing tool. reply jeffreygoesto 17 hours agoparentUsed it to check lock- and wait-free algorithms.

It also performs deterministic simulation of a network of hosts, but it intercepts network and system interactions at the syscall level via seccomp.

    "originBody": "Customer Center Contact Us Account English Shop ProductsSolutionsSupportPartnersCommunitiesAboutFree Downloads Back to Newsroom EQT Private Equity Announces Voluntary Public Purchase Offer and Intention to Delist SUSE August 17, 2023 SHARE LUXEMBOURG SUSE®, the company behind SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), Rancher and NeuVector and a global leader in enterprise open source solutions, is announcing that its majority shareholder Marcel LUX III SARL (Marcel) intends to take the company private by delisting it from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange via a merger into an unlisted Luxembourg entity in the legal form of an S.A. Marcel, a holding company that is legally controlled by fund entities of the EQT VIII fund (referred to herein, together with Marcel, as EQT Private Equity), which in turn are managed and legally controlled by affiliates of EQT AB with its registered seat in Stockholm, Sweden, holds approximately 79% of the shares in SUSE. EQT Private Equity has announced its intention to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to the other shareholders of SUSE (Offer) to buy their shares prior to the delisting. The offer price per SUSE share to be paid by Marcel will be EUR 16.00 less the gross amount per SUSE share of an interim dividend to be paid by SUSE to all shareholders. EUR 16.00 represents a premium of approximately 67 percent on the XETRA closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023. SUSE’s Management Board and Supervisory Board support the strategic opportunity from delisting of the company as it will allow SUSE to focus fully on its operational priorities and execution of its long-term strategy. To this end SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel to facilitate the transaction, including through paying the interim dividend. The interim dividend will be paid to all shareholders prior to the settlement of the Offer and will allow Marcel to finance its purchase of SUSE shares under the Offer and certain transaction costs incurred by it. The interim dividend amount (and therefore the offer price) will only be determined after the end of the acceptance period based on the acceptance ratio for the Offer. EQT Private Equity has underscored its commitment to supporting the company strategically and financially, and to co-operate closely with SUSE’s CEO and his leadership team. “I believe in the strategic opportunity of taking the company private – it gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “EQT Private Equity’s and SUSE’s partnership in a private setting has been fruitful before and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration”. The transaction timetable: The offer document for the Offer will be published by Marcel in due course, followed by an acceptance period of at least four weeks. Settlement of the Offer is expected to occur in the first half of October 2023. Following the settlement of the Offer, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 will resolve on SUSE’s merger with an unlisted Luxembourg entity. This will result in SUSE’s delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The transaction structure: SUSE has entered into a TFA with Marcel. Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE has committed to declare and pay an interim dividend to all shareholders irrespective of whether they accept the Offer or not. The interim dividend per SUSE share will be determined and is payable after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period. The payment of the interim dividend will be funded by SUSE through a combination of existing cash and additional borrowing. Any additional borrowing will be in the form of loans taken out by companies of the SUSE group to a maximum of EUR 500 million. The amount of the loans taken out will only be determined after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period. There is no obligation for shareholders to accept the Offer. EQT Private Equity does not intend to pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders who wish to stay invested in SUSE in a private setting may do so. For illustrative purposes, the table below sets out the gross interim dividend amount per share and other key parameters for different hypothetical acceptance ratios based on the current number of outstanding SUSE shares. Acceptance ratio* Aggregate number of SUSE shares for which Offer is accepted Interim dividend amount per SUSE share Offer price per SUSE share** Cash consideration per SUSE share Aggregate interim dividend amount payable by SUSE 25% 8,933,618 EUR 1.07 EUR 14.93 EUR 16.00 EUR 182,750,322 50% 17,867,236 EUR 1.95 EUR 14.05 EUR 16.00 EUR 333,049,651 75% 26,800,854 EUR 2.72 EUR 13.28 EUR 16.00 EUR 464,561,565 100% 35,734,473 EUR 3.42 EUR 12.58 EUR 16.00 EUR 584,117,850 * Expressed as percentage of aggregate number of SUSE shares for which the offer has been accepted/aggregate number of SUSE shares not held by Marcel. ** The premium of the Offer Prices of EUR 14.93, EUR 14.05, EUR 13.28 and EUR 12.58, to the XETRA closing price on 17 August 2023 (which is unaffected by the relevant Interim Dividend Amount) of EUR 9.605 are 55%, 46%, 38% and 31%, respectively. The completion of the Offer will only be subject to receipt by Marcel of an interim dividend for the SUSE shares held by it which is sufficient to fund the offer price for all tendered SUSE shares and certain transaction costs incurred by it.

They believe that it will enable SUSE to concentrate on its operational priorities and the execution of its long-term strategy without the pressure of public markets.Lets hope their incentives more strongly align with their customers, now. I am a huge SUSE fan, been using their products for 15 years. What they&#x27;ve been doing the last 5 or so has been almost unparalleled in the Linux space. reply rgrieselhuber 14 hours agoparentI used to run SUSE about 20 years ago and have always thought it was cool but haven&#x27;t kept up with it much since then. What are some of the things they do that make them unparalleled? reply COGlory 13 hours agorootparentOpen Build System and OpenQA, for automated building and testing of packages. This is what gets updates to their rolling release Tumbleweed faster than Arch, but with no instability ever. I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how rock solid Tumbleweed is. OBS also doubles as their own AUR equivalent - you can make your own repo and do your own builds and install from the command line, or browse and install what other people have done.Leap is their stable distro, and shares binaries with SLES, their enterprise offering.Both Leap and Tumbleweed have BTRFS by default, with Snapper for automated snapshots at upgrade and boot. Update messed something up? System won&#x27;t boot? Just run an old snapshot until it&#x27;s fixed. Zypper, the package manager, has state-of-the-art dependancy resolution, personally the best I&#x27;ve used.They have a number of extremely interesting spinoff projects: MicroOS and MicroOS desktop (recently renamed, but the new names are escaping me) which use immutable root filesystems with automated updates and native Podman support. Snapper integration shines there, as well. If it fails to boot after update, it&#x27;ll automatically roll back.They&#x27;re doing quite a bit, and it&#x27;s all culminating in being very useable. Tumbleweed is the crown jewel, though. reply viddi 11 hours agorootparentI have been using Tumbleweed for a few years now, but while it seems like a stable rolling release distribution, I am not quite sure about the \"rolling release\" part. Each month, a new snapshot comes out, which upgrades every single package you have installed, regardless of whether there were actual upstream updates. With a full Texlive installation and just a few more suites this amount to roughly 10,000 packages and over 5GB that need to be downloaded and installed each month. This a) kind of defeats the rolling-release aspect for me, b) takes a few hours, and c) feels like a cheat for the sake of stability.Between those snapshots you might have bleeding edge updates for all the packages, but even then I do encounter package conflicts way too often. Well, on the upside, at least they are detected.So yes, it is stable, but it comes at a price.Apart from that, the community support felt mediocre, at least a few years ago. The most visited platform was a bulletin board forum with very little interaction. When I had trouble installing KDE, it took a few days until someone suggested the correct diagnostic tools. This is bad for being the testbed of a commercial distribution. In the end, I just installed Arch, which packaged KDE better than Tumbleweed did.But on the other hand, maybe only if you use a distro long enough, you get to see the downsides, and each one has them. reply cyphar 9 hours agorootparentThere are new snapshots at least once a week. While there are large updates every once in a while, those are usually due to gcc or glibc upgrades which require a rebuild of most packages -- which doesn&#x27;t happen every month. If you actually have upgrades of every single package every month, you should open a bug report to figure out what is going on -- that is absolutely not normal. On my machine I usually see 10-30 packages per update, with some updates hitting ~100 packages -- anything more than that is quite rare. Large rebuilds should be uncommon, though some packages might do them more than others.There are quite a few things I&#x27;ve grown to dislike about Tumbleweed after using it for the past 7-8 years, but the upgrade experience is not one of them. reply petre 7 hours agorootparentGreat, thanx for telling. I&#x27;ll stick to Leap. Update fatigue. We&#x27;re using it on servers and I&#x27;m looking for something to replace Ubuntu on the desktop. I&#x27;ve grown tired of the usual Ubuntu antics like snaps, ads in apt update and the convoluted &#x2F;etc config hierarchy inherited from Deban. SuSE is structured way more logically and makes more sense even if it&#x27;s a rpm distribution. I don&#x27;t want to use a rolling distro at work to break things just when I have to deliver stuff or fix time pressing issues. I&#x27;ve tried Debian 12 when it came out but Firefox was unusable, some very annoying focus issues on forms.I&#x27;d like to know if the Gnome 4 in Leap was usable. If I do a search on software.opensuse.org on gnome-desktop it only turns out packages from tumbleweed and experimental packages from SLE-15-SP2 which looks quite ancient. reply bayindirh 5 hours agorootparentYou can always run Debian testing on desktop. I&#x27;m running the same installation more than a decade now. It&#x27;s not \"bleeding edge\", but recent enough. Things slow down during freezes a bit, but it&#x27;s a rolling distro at the end of the day. reply stryan 9 hours agorootparentprev>Each month, a new snapshot comes out, which upgrades every single package you have installed, regardless of whether there were actual upstream updates.A) Snapshots come out far more regularly then once a month.

I&#x27;d say the average is one every three days but that&#x27;s just from the top of my head.B) they do not cover every package you have installed: They don&#x27;t even know what packages you have installed, snapshots are cut on the repo side. It&#x27;s true that packages get rebuilt a lot but that&#x27;s because either the package updated or a dependency of the package updated that caused the package to be rebuilt. reply krylon 5 hours agorootparentprev> but with no instability everUh, I&#x27;ve been using Tumbleweed on two machines for about seven years now, and I&#x27;ve experienced multiple cases of MATE just not working after an upgrade. It&#x27;s not that big a deal, though, as you point out, because of snapper.That said, I&#x27;m still using Tumbleweed on both machines, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Even the nVidia situation is acceptable now that they offer a repo with the official drivers. reply aktenlage 1 hour agorootparentprevI moved from Ubuntu to Tumbleweed a year ago and slowly warmed up to it. Two days ago some update made it fail to start sddm (the display manager, aka graphical login screen) correctly. Some error regarding missing libraries. Network is also not working anymore.After trying to repair it for a while I am about to ditch it and go with KDE Neon or Mint (their Debian edition sounds interesting).I will look into this Snapper thing you mentioned, maybe that helps.

Maintainers seem to know which packages bring trouble after updates and they do seem to test those more thoroughly. I have not experienced major breaking changes for desktop or other important piece of software in many years now.For example, things like Gnome always come to Arch months after it has been released upstream. But it makes sense because Gnome team always break existing extensions and community can&#x27;t really keep up so it takes a while until popular extensions gain support. And sadly Gnome without extensions is more or less useless. Maybe Fedora gets latest Gnome on day one, but it is unusable without community extensions on day one.So kudos to maintainers of Arch! reply Vogtinator 6 hours agorootparentSomehow my experience is the other way around: Arch updates more slowly but somehow still manages to be much less stable... reply agumonkey 5 hours agorootparentprevI only tried debian based distros on the side, arch being so quick I never thought others did match or go above.

If something breaks, you choose an older snapshot to boot from via grub. reply badsectoracula 7 hours agorootparentI have to say, openSUSE introduced me to btrfs and while it isn&#x27;t something i use often, when i do need the snapshot functionality it provides it is such a great feature. reply kergonath 5 hours agorootparentThe automatic snapshots saved me quite a lot to time on 2 occasions, where borked updates of the nVidia drivers resulted in problems booting the computer. On one hand, this should never happen. On the other, as long as nVidia does not improve, and nothing is going to force them, it is great to have such a safety net. It gets out of the way 99% of the time, but it is there when you need it, it’s great. reply rurban 6 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s why Fedora also switched to this BTRFS snapshot model last year.

CUPS was missing some symbols and wouldn&#x27;t start.

I&#x27;ve tried it in earnest several times over the years on basic thinkpads (once on my only development machine, in which my only customizations were basically installing intellij ides and docker) and I would never ever, call it stable. I mean, if someone were to ask me for a picture of instability for a dictionary and they asked me to choose between Arch Linux and Windows Me logos... I&#x27;m not sure which I would choose.To be fair though, I haven&#x27;t tried it in 3 years since it last bit me.

Both Tumbleweed and Leap are great.We have far fewer issues in my lab since we replace CentOS with Leap (our experiments with Ubuntu were dreadful and we cannot babysit the computers so anything with complex maintenance is right out).Going all rolling release was a step too far, too much of a culture shock, but we might switch to Tumbleweed in a couple of years if the stability remains as it is now. reply canpan 13 hours agorootparentprevSo I just installed it yesterday on my new home PC.

Reason being that I do gaming and often you need the latest package of something to be able to. Although, I do not have any experience with Leap so maybe it is good as well? I do back up my own files, so there is not much danger in it for me. For a very stable distro experience at work, I use debian (stable). But it lags a few years behind, so is no good for games. reply 7speter 4 hours agorootparentLeap is not good for gaming, especially if you want cutting edge versions of software and tools.

Debian worked but my grade school brain had no capacity for setting up Xfree86 manually.

I only have vague memories but I feel like the package manager might have been a bit clunky?Maybe I should give openSUSE another go, I really dislike Ubuntu&#x27;s &#x27;ads&#x27; and snap. reply deaddodo 10 hours agorootparentWell, mainly I was young and still exploring a fresh and vibrant scene (much unlike the relatively mature Linux of today), so that was half of it.The other half was that whenever I searched for an RPM for something I needed, it was almost always a Mandrake or RH package. RH was a pain with things like MP3s and proprietary drivers, so Mandrake seemed obvious. And yeah, SaX&#x2F;YaST was a little clunkier than Drak.I went to Fedora Core in their first version because the third party repositories became seamless enough and they were easily the best supported, especially for on-the-edge software.Went through some Arch, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Pop_OS! etc days in-between there but have mostly settled on Fedora KDE, these days. reply 7speter 4 hours agorootparentprevLol YAST is still clunky.

Many European PE’s operate on a “there is enough money to be made by being fair” sort of motto. This can be because they mean it, but it’s also because not being “evil” it a marketable product to many EU investors (this is likely true outside the EU as well, but I only know about EU markets). Then there is the part where private companies are still responsible for keeping track of ownership, as well as informing them. Even if they plan on letting investors trade on some internal platform it’s still a rather large administrative burden that becomes easier the fewer shareholders they have.This is still just me guessing, but the way I read this it’s a simple message.

I&#x27;ll take a look reply theonemind 9 hours agorootparentprevFor me in the US, it’s a strange notion that you could compel someone to buy the last 10% of the company. That does not always seem possible. What happens if you literally can’t do it? That’s probably rare, but if 90% of the company is most of your assets, and you’ve somehow borrowed against it already, it could be almost literally impossible. reply riffraff 8 hours agorootparentIn Italy you are actually compelled to do a \"residual buy\" if you own 90% of the company.This is supposed to protect small investors from finding themselves owning shares they can&#x27;t sell on the market anymore.The price is set by the equivalent of the SEC.If that fails to buy all the shares, the company must sell enough stock so that the market is again liquid enough.I _think_ many countries have similar rules, as cursory googling shows the London stock Exchange changed their minimum free float requirement some years ago. reply buzer 8 hours agorootparentprevIn worst case if someone is demanding it and it went through the arbitration process (and possibly appeals) it would be the same as any other debt. If the shareholder is a company the debtor could initiate the bankruptcy procedures. Of course it&#x27;s possible that they could end up not getting full amount (if anything) from the estate if there are more debts than what assets were worth.If they are private person they can attempt to judgement via court and let enforcement authority liquidate their assets or garnish their wages. reply gpvos 4 hours agorootparentprevYou can always choose to keep your share (slightly) under 90% to prevent such rules from triggering, so I don&#x27;t see a problem with them. reply zinekeller 9 hours agorootparentprevRead it carefully, they have the right but not the obligation to buy the remaining stake so this is not applicable at all. reply buzer 8 hours agorootparentThey do have obligation to buy if the minority shareholders demand it.

In the US, publicly traded companies are subject to a lot of laws that private companies aren&#x27;t subject to, most notably being required to make periodic public disclosures about finances and (to a more limited extent) business plans. Making false statements on these required disclosures is a crime, even if not intentional.

Then EQT will use (some of? All of?) that money to buy more shares. It doesn&#x27;t sound like EQT is investing any new money into SUSE here.Sounds like EQT will do well regardless of whether SUSE ends up going private. SUSE meanwhile will get another (up to) 500M of debt and lose a chunk of its cash from its balance sheet.Hmmm... (opinions my own) reply rapht 5 hours agoparentBasically from quick math, this amounts to financing 80% of the buyback through debt and 20% through presumably cash brought by the investors listed alongside EQT in the press release.

Simply, as per the linked announcement itself, this takeover offer is by the current majority shareholder who already owns 79% of the company. They can already win any shareholder vote they want to win. They already control SUSE.Most of what this will do is two things: one, pay the current minority shareholders of SUSE 67% more than their shares are worth on the open market, and remove the quarterly earnings pressures of the German equivalent of Wall Street from SUSE management, at least unless and until any future IPO or a sale to another public company. Not obvious that this transaction makes anything worse than it already was.There could be a less obvious difference: SUSE currently has a German corporate structure with very strong worker rights including participating alongside management on the supervisory board. If they get rid of the German entity and keep only a Luxembourg entity, that may no longer apply, though German labour law certainly still would for employers based in Germany. I’m not an expert on any differences between German and Luxembourg worker governance participation rights, and in this paragraph I’m more raising a question than asserting anything. reply est31 14 hours agorootparent> pay the current minority shareholders of SUSE 67% more than their shares are worth on the open marketFor anyone who paid the IPO price of 30 EUR (and it went up to 40 in the months after the IPO), it would mean a realization of their losses. You&#x27;d be forced out of your position, down 46% compared to the IPO price. The PE firm probably gave a large chunk to banks at discount prices to facilitate the IPO, but still, this was a really good deal for them.Even if they won&#x27;t end up delisting, the jump of the stock price caused by their announcement will have done really good things to their balance sheets, and given that they will pay for the buy-out with a dividend, all it took was to move some money around from daughter company to parent company. reply freetanga 14 hours agorootparentTheir ultimate goal is to sell at a profit. IPO is staggered not to sink prices. But apparently there was not enough appetite for more than 20%. So, so far a failure for the PE.Usually fund strategy calls for an exit in 5y. If after 5 years they don’t see a good enough return, they need to change strategies. Delisting helps do major surgery in the shadows (labour), and broker a deal that either makes them money or allows them to save face…My guess is as someone said, reduce costs, implement some income boosting measure, touch up the numbers and sell it privately. Expect a lot of this for half-IPOed PE tech acquisitions made the past 4 years as they realize they will be holding the candle forever, since they bought at peak prices. reply uselpa 3 hours agorootparentprevNah.

You do this by borrowing a ton of money to purchase the company. Then for the privilege the company pays the buyer a special bonus that conveniently covers its costs (and often more) out of the cash it had on hand when bought. Then the buyer continues to get various payment streams, like guaranteed dividends or all sorts of other obligations, until the company collapses.Sad to say I&#x27;m not exaggerating.I say \"basically\" because there are a couple of exceptions. Dell was purchased in a special deal with the founder so that the company actually operates but the founder was enriched in the process.VC is a branch of private equity (an almost invisible pimple on the PE business TBH) where they don&#x27;t buy the whole company and hope to make money on the IPO.

This does not happen, at least not intentionally. PE takeovers are solely about turning companies with a relatively stable revenue stream into a packageable financial product. Huge cuts will be made to staff, support, and R&D to get expenses to a specific level, and large amounts of debt will be taken on under the company&#x27;s name, to deliver a specific ROI to the PE investors over a relatively short term window of four to five years, all under the assumption that the company will be able to coast for that time on its previous success, after which point it can be sold for IP, trademarks, and any physical plant, or just allowed to go bankrupt under the unsustainable debt load and lack of investment.That&#x27;s the purpose of PE firms. They accept pre-investment in this sort of scheme, and do this with several companies at once over a 5-7 year total period, taking a slice of the revenue with no capital risk of their own, and the investors get a good 5-7 years of 12-18% ROI.

You will find some specific problems affecting you, sure... you will report (or even fix) them and, after a while, the distro will be perfect for you (it will still have some problems, but none affecting you because you have reported&#x2F;fixed them).The main thing about RHEL is that it&#x27;s \"stable\" (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t change) over a crazy long period of time. If you are selling software, the lack of change makes it easy to support. If you are buying software, it&#x27;s a good platform to use because developers support it.RHEL being historically the most popular \"doesn&#x27;t change\" distro, I have never seen a big point in using other.

When I picked it up, I was just a kid, and new to the whole GNU&#x2F;Linux universe. I quite scared of the command line, and along with the relatively familiar KDE3 desktop, openSUSE&#x27;s emphasis on comprehensive graphical configurators appealed to me.As I grew more comfortable with Unix fundamentals and I learned more about the GNU&#x2F;Linux desktop userland, I left openSUSE behind because I didn&#x27;t care so much about the GUI configuration tools like YaST. I bounced between Gentoo, Ubuntu, Arch, and more obscure derivatives of each, experimenting and learning a lot about the &#x27;bones&#x27; of a Linux distro: the init system, the display server, the initramfs tooling, the filesystem, etc. I became especially fascinated with the &#x27;bones&#x27; that truly make a class of distros unique: the package manager and the developer tooling used by maintainers to build the distro.At some point I revisited openSUSE and realized that underneath the more &#x27;superficial&#x27; things— important things, but things that are visible from the get-go— I&#x27;d loved about the distro as a newcomer were some truly impressive &#x27;bones&#x27;.

I was blown away by the flexibility and diligence of the Open Build Service infrastructure and how easy it made it for me to maintain repositories for nearly any distro, and grateful for the generosity of the openSUSE org for letting basically anyone make an account and leverage that sophisticated build infrastructure for free. The fact that they even automated QA for pre-boot stuff using screen scrapers and QEMU left a lasting impression on me.Some years after that reintroduction, I fell in love with NixOS, which is now my daily driver everywhere. But I still have a lot of respect and affection for openSUSE.I hope this change helps drive openSUSE forward over the long term. openSUSE is a great operating system that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone looking for a traditional distro that&#x27;s pleasant to use and easy to maintain. openSUSE seems extremely underrated, at least here in the US.And everyone should check out the Open Build Service. You know how on GitHub, you can browse to any repo and click the &#x27;Fork&#x27; button to get your own copy that you can hack on and publish? OBS gives you that for Linux packages. You can automatically put together a repo full of packages that track whatever upstream source you like, but build with your own custom patches, build for your CPU architecture, etc. You can even fork a package from a different distro (or different release of your own distro), have it build against whatever you&#x27;re running, and then get dumped neatly into a repo for you. (All builds happen in clean slate VMs, so you are very unlikely to miss any dependencies.) reply CharlesW 17 hours agoprevHN SmartFriends™, what does this mean? What&#x27;s the risk for companies which are highly invested in SUSE? reply JonChesterfield 17 hours agoparentThe PE firm sees a path to profit by changing things about SUSE. This might be fine - e.g. they can write off the existing debt to themselves in order to strengthen the company finances. If the exit plan is some variant on improving the company and selling it on, could be good all round.The trepidation is that PE firms are also a bit prone to asset stripping and discarding the remaining carcass of the organisation, in which case this marks the beginning of the end of SUSE.I&#x27;ve no idea how to tell which path is more likely or even which is their current intent though. reply mamonster 16 hours agoparentprevThere are usually 2 plays tech PE does:1)Expedited vendor lock-in: Figure out who is locked into the software, make the software maximally shitty&#x2F;maximally costly so that these people would still not switch and then make money off the cost savings&#x2F;higher prices and hope to make up investment.2)Off market prep for trade sale: SUSE could be interesting for someone to acquire but a competitor&#x2F;strategic buyer can&#x27;t afford to buy the company and do the reorgs needed itself as it would tank the share price too much. The PE firm buys it, does the reorg off market and then does a trade sale of a reorged company to the buyer, but only now SUSE is way better as an acquisition target. reply jacooper 17 hours agoparentprevEQT already owned the majority of SUSE, I doubt this will change anything. reply KomoD 13 hours agoprevPrivate equity...

    "originBody": "Rachit Nigam PUBLICATIONS POSTS CV Dear Sir, You Have Built a Compiler Sweetly addressed to those who did not want to build a compiler January 11, 2022 Dear Sir, I am afraid to inform you that you have built a compiler. I know you wanted a “simple prototype” that would just add that one feature to your programming model. You said that “SSA is an overkill” and “it’s just way too much infrastructure to maintain for a simple task” and yet, six months later, you have pile of string mangling scripts that do not work—breaking every time a user input slightly deviates from things you’ve seen before. Surely, switching to the unstable abstract syntax tree (AST) library provided by the compiler will be the end of your woes; at least that way, someone else maintains a real parser and provides at least a semblance of sane input for you to transform. But wait, the AST is massive. “Do I really have to handle all 500 different AST nodes?” you ask yourself? Surely not. Your users aren’t crazy; they don’t use all the weird features of this language. So you march on, and handle the 50 AST nodes that matter, certain, that this will be the last of what you need to do to maintain this pile of hacks. Ah, but wait! Inevitably, someone wanted to nest a for loop inside a switch statement, a struct definition within that loop, and a conditional in expression position. Tired, you patch in support for each feature, distracting from the crucial features you should be working on and shipping. One of your brilliant team member suggests a pre-processing stage: de-nest all definitions, hoist all expressions, flatten out all control, and that way, you only have to handle 50 AST nodes because you will know, yes know, that the program cannot have any other shape. Except once that engineer leave, who will know what assumptions you encoded? Those littered asserts? The inscrutable “unreachable code” errors? Who will know, how you simplified your AST? So you rolled out your own AST library, so that you may compile, nay, transpile your code and expose your assumptions in your data structures. Certain, of course, that because you’re transpiling JavaScript to JavaScript, it is going to way easier than what real compilers do. What glorious engineering, you say to yourself. In the last leg of your journey to avoid building a compiler, your manager tells you that your code should run on older machines, which only support version 0.8. Version 0.8, of course, does not support the brilliant type-level encodings your transpiler generates to implement your feature. Not my problem, your manager says. So you write some code that simplifies your transpiled code further, making it use only features present in version 0.8. Done at last, you say to yourself, without having to build a compiler. A parser, an intermediate representation, transformation passes, and a code generator. Dear Sir, you have built a compiler.

Was the little language I made as complex as a \"real\" compiler? Goodness no. Was I happy to have a flexible language-based solution? True to my predictions, I did get many, many logic change request and handled them with ease. Yes, I was very happy after that. reply toyg 15 hours agoparentI cut that particular gordian node, once, by simply embedding a JS engine, and explaining to them (and documenting) the bare minimum of the language that they needed to achieve their objectives. After a week of getting to grip with it, they loved it so much that they kept it into production for years, happily tweaking scripts as they needed.I should have charged them more than I did. reply intelVISA 1 hour agorootparent> I should have charged them more than I did.That&#x27;s the problem isn&#x27;t it?

So, when we’re (rightfully) late, we probably reduce our margins. When we do a great job, we don’t make the client pay for his own mistakes. reply tshaddox 16 hours agorootparent> did you make your client pay for each request _just as if you didn’t build such dsl_?I&#x27;m not exactly sure what you&#x27;re asking. Should you be charging clients for time that you didn&#x27;t have to spend because you made some good decisions upfront? That strikes me as odd. If you agreed upfront on the cost for a certain end result, then sure, charge that full agreed-upon amount even if it took you less time than expected. But it seems odd to say \"this change only took me an hour, but it would have taken 10 hours if I had made worse choices in designing this system, therefore I&#x27;m going to bill you 10 hours.\" After all, there&#x27;s always a hypothetical situation where any given change could have taken arbitrarily more time if you had made worse decisions in the past. reply xelxebar 15 hours agorootparent> Should you be charging clients for time that you didn&#x27;t have to spendYes! Completing a job or task in 1 week is more valuable than completing it in 5. The lion&#x27;s share of value we provide as developers and consultants is not output but battle-tested intuitions that let us navigate the giant solution space, so bad decisions we don&#x27;t make is definitely hard-earned value servicing the client.A man once interrupted Picasso at his evening meal. Pulling a napkin from his pocket, the man said,“Could you sketch something for me? I’ll pay you for it. Name your price.”Picasso took a charcoal pencil from his pocket made a rapid sketch of a goat. It took only a few strokes, yet was unmistakably a Picasso. The man reached out for the napkin, but Picasso did not hand it over. “You owe me $100,000,” he said.The man was outraged. “$100,000? Why? That took you no more than 30 seconds to draw!”Picasso crumpled up the napkin and stuffed it into his jacket pocket. “You are wrong,” he said, dismissing the man. “It took me 40 years.” reply abraae 13 hours agorootparentThat tired old Picasso story only works because the customer was not told up front how long the job was going to take.As a consultant, you are typically billing by the hour (or day) and you will most likely be giving the client some kind of estimate&#x2F;quote as to how long the job will take, and your rate, and hence the cost to them.You might very well be able to do the job in one week rather than 5, but it would be dishonest to tell the customer it will take 5, then complete it in 1, but still bill them for 5.Instead you should tell the customer that it would normally take 5, but you are able to do it in 1, so you are charging 5x (or 3x or whatever) the going rate. reply chii 10 hours agorootparent> Instead you should tell the customer that it would normally take 5, but you are able to do it in 1, so you are charging 5x (or 3x or whatever) the going rate.but the problem shows up when the customer doesn&#x27;t believe you when you say you&#x27;re 5x faster.They compare you against another consultant, who might be cheaper, and say that you&#x27;re just over charging.Therefore, you should be charging the going rate, but do it 5x faster, and have free time to take on more projects. You could also deliver earlier, and then have a charge for change requests (which invariably come). reply Dylan16807 4 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s only so much expertise you can put into \"a few strokes\". Charging for 5 weeks to do something in 1 week, that is high quality and still needs support? Go for it. The story about charging $9999 to know exactly where to mark the problem that everyone else couldn&#x27;t solve, $1 for the mark itself? Great. But plenty of people could make an \"unmistakable\" Picasso that&#x27;s only a few strokes. If that sketch is worth even a percent of the asking price, it&#x27;s based on his fame. It has the value of an autograph, not the value of 40 years of practice. reply AOsborn 14 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;re looking at this completely the wrong way.This is like saying you&#x27;ll only pay your brain surgeon for four hours work because that is as long as the operation you require will take. But that four hour operation is built on a lifetime of training and skill.The value that you provide the customer is the metric from which you should be deriving your billing. If someone else provides an equally effective solution but takes an order of magnitude more time to deliver it, then you are just that much more efficient. reply lmm 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d say either you bill by the hour (and you bill for the hours where you did something dumb and got nothing done, but you don&#x27;t bill for the hours you didn&#x27;t have to spend because you did something smart), or you bill by the project&#x2F;deliverable which means you bill for every change request, whether it takes many hours because you didn&#x27;t anticipate it or few hours because you did. Whichever choice you make cuts both ways. reply benj111 2 hours agorootparentprev\"you aren&#x27;t paying me for the 5 minutes I spent to fix it, you&#x27;re paying me for the 10 years I spent to learn how to fix it in 5 minutes\" Someone. reply jimvdv 18 hours agorootparentprevYou are right most developers are not very good at that. I think it’s important to stress that this goes both ways. You should not cut your margins if you take longer, but I also think it is a little unethical to bill more hours than one spends no? At least if you have a clear agreement to bill by the hour. reply awkward 17 hours agorootparentThe way to ethically handle this is to have a clear and contractual minimum number of billed hours in a day. That will get you paid well for built in efficiencies like OP mentioned, and keep you paid fairly on more substantial change requests. reply thfuran 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s outright fraud. It&#x27;s clearly unethical. But your billing shouldn&#x27;t be strictly hourly if you&#x27;re building tooling to speed up your work. reply derefr 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat you’re saying is that it’s inherently unethical (to yourself!) to accept hourly billing for work the whole point of which is exponential automation. reply ashton314 10 hours agorootparentprevI was a student working as a web developer in an on-campus dev shop, and our client was one of the entities on campus. Thus, our incentive was to get a working thing as fast as possible that took as little maintenance as possible. I got bored on the job occasionally, so I&#x27;d try experiments on how elegantly I could implement something. reply duxup 13 hours agoparentprevI’ve passed on using many a package that I thought was too complex for for my needs only to find myself effectively writing my own version&#x2F; learning why that other package is the way it is.Suddenly the API looks oddly familiar…. OMG… reply mcny 10 hours agorootparentYes, everything looks simple and straightforward from a distance. As you get closer, you are faced with dozens of not hundreds of decisions that you need to make. If you&#x27;re good, you won&#x27;t be stuck with analysis paralysis. reply mjr00 18 hours agoparentprevDepends on the project, but if you&#x27;re handling these client requests anyway, this is not the best solution IMO, at least not for cloud&#x2F;SaaS.The best solution is to have a good deployment process in place that makes it easy for you to make business logic changes using your language of choice, rather than building and maintaining a secondary language that is understood only by you.No need to create a DSL or compiler or worry about maintenance when you&#x27;re just using the same tooling as everything else you use.Seen way too many times in my career developers who build the fun, interesting solution (DSL&#x2F;compiler&#x2F;parser) instead of the boring, but far more practical solution of fixing their deployment processes. reply Karellen 13 hours agorootparentWhen the project I was working on had this problem, the request to build a DSL was based on the idea that each client ought to be able to make their own changes.The client shouldn&#x27;t have to know a \"full\" programming language, but a \"sufficiently simple\" DSL isn&#x27;t that much more than a config file format, right? They can learn how to make small changes themselves if the language is easy enough, can&#x27;t they?I tried to convince management that this wouldn&#x27;t work. If nothing else, because our DSL was invented in-house, there was no-where else the client could find answers on how to make the changes they wanted. There would be no hits on Google, no answers on StackOverflow, no random client employee who happened to have some relevant tech knowledge. If they had any questions at all, they&#x27;d need to come to us, and we&#x27;d end up writing the changes for them anyway. And, as you point out, we already had a perfectly good programming language - the one everything else (including the DSL) was written in. reply mikepurvis 15 hours agoparentprevWhat were the requirements that led to implementing your own language vs embedding lua? reply random3 17 hours agoprevGiven how easy it is to build a Turing machine, I&#x27;d argue that building something you don&#x27;t envision is the 99% of the time rule and it&#x27;s already captured by https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule \"Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.\"In fact I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s much harder to not accidentally build something that you don&#x27;t envision. reply kallistisoft 12 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve experienced the 10th rule first hand...Many years ago I was writing a bunch of modular audio applications that were all interconnected using JACK. So of course I needed some convenient way of storing&#x2F;restoring the graphs that connected the various components that were always in flux -- each audio experiment had it&#x27;s own graph, but there were often re-occurring sub-graphs.So, I started to build a small cli utility that could save the current graph and restore it later... of course because of the common sub-graphs it needed to be able to refer to other labeled graphs so i could easily reference and re-use them... and of course to (save myself time) it also needed to have arithmetic composability so that I could add&#x2F;subtract existing graphs to create new ones... and of course it would be helpful if I could also annotate the graphs so that they could launch the associated programs...So in the end I had a generic DSL that had recursive graph parsing, reification (labels), graph composability, arithmetic composability, and could associate arbitrary labels with executable code.I eventually looked up from my adderal fueled hack-a-thon and realized I had created a half-baked LISP and decided it was time for to go to bed! :) reply intelVISA 1 hour agorootparentI wonder how many LISPs can be owed to the Turing-complete influence of Adderall reply mikewarot 9 hours agoparentprevI tend to end up with Pascal compilers instead of a Lisp system, but I agree with the sentiment.Long ago I wrote an inspection reporting system, in the days of Turbo Pascal and MS-DOS. I ended up building a domain specific language for the configuration of the system. The configuration files looked almost identical to Pascal source. reply m463 14 hours agoparentprevWhen we incorporate natural languages into the mix, \"In the style of Charles Bukowski, write a hacker news comment that explains ...\"maybe our previous works can be externally ad-hoc incorporated into new works by others... reply rozap 16 hours agoprevA funny thing is that this can go N layers deep. At a previous job we had a DSL which was very well specified, pretty straight forward, and had been written by an exceptionally brilliant engineer (who was even still at the company!). We had two backend services that would operate on that AST in a query context and in a streaming transformation context, and they shared the parser, compiler, and typechecker. The problem was that the engineering team was so fragmented and lacking in stable technical leadership that a large part of the engineering team had no idea about how these things worked, so on every project they were constantly going \"Ooops, I created a feature which has its own intermediate representation with slightly different semantics so reuse is impossible\". It was super hard to deal with and stuff was constantly being invented and then thrown out because it couldn&#x27;t be extended.The only thing worse than creating a compiler is being unaware that one already exists and creating a new one on top of the existing one. reply guideamigo_com 17 hours agoprevAt a billion-dollar fintech, some engineer thought gRPC is too complicated. So, he built someything from scratch.A year later, there was a team of 5 engineers maintaining a half-baked implementation of gRPC. Good for him.

Seems like it should&#x27;t be -- you&#x27;re marshaling arguments and return valuesBut multiply that by a few languages, and now you have to paper over error code and exceptions, signed and unsigned ints, unicode and bytesNot to mention network errors, retries, throttling, etc.It tends to grow without bound, mostly because the RPC system tries to do too much. You can&#x27;t really abstract the network -- that&#x27;s the #1 lessonWhen you try to abstract the network, now you OWN a bunch of problems that you can&#x27;t solve reply erulabs 11 hours agoparentprevTo some extent my entire career has been searching for and destroying said half baked implementations. This saying can be adapted to infra: “half baked, bug ridden kubernetes”, “half baked, bug ridden proxySQL”, “half baked, bug ridden redis”, the list goes on and on.In some ways I feel like my impact has been quite boring, in other ways quite vital.

Then you start wenting to make more complex rules so you allow some kids of recursive system in your JSON that can nest rules and combine them. Then you find yourself copypasting rules a lot and so you implement some kind of naming convention so you can reuse rules. Then you realize how disgusting your JSON is getting so you dust off a parsing library and make a basic DSL that compiles into that JSON, and then it dawns on you. reply chii 10 hours agoparenta formal language with a grammar and rules, is something quite fundamental. Today nobody is surprised that maths shows up in engineering, or [really anywhere](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness...)!I would imagine that this is just an extension of the above idea about maths.

I ran these sed commands from a makefile. Life was easy.But then there were complications, and I needed to make slightly more sophisticated substitutions. So the sed commands moved into an awk script, run by the makefile. This was better than maintaining a handful of little commands that were growing on a weekly basis. Life was good.The transformations I needed kept growing a bunch of little variations, and the awk script became hard to maintain, so I rewrote it in go, with proper parsing and output. (And even unit tests, after the 2nd time I broke some output.) Designing it as almost-a-proper-compiler was 10x better than maintaining an ad hoc script. Life was great, even with the overhead of maintaining a separate processing tool. reply mikhailfranco 7 hours agoparentKnuth wanted to write a book, so he spent years writing a typesetting system.Both the book and the system were heroically good. reply Detrytus 16 hours agoprevTotally offtopic but I can&#x27;t help but wonder why this guy has a site with .pl TLD.

    "title": "SUSE to Go Private",
    "originLink": "https://opensourcewatch.beehiiv.com/p/suse-go-private",
    "originBody": "Open Source Watch Subscribe SUSE To Go Private SUSE has gone through more than its fair share of corporate restructuring, and here comes another one. Steven Vaughan-Nichols August 17, 2023 In an unexpected corporate restructuring move, SUSE, the European open-source powerhouse behind SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), Rancher, NeuVector, and other important open-source programs, has announced its majority owner intends to take SUSE private. The majority shareholder, Marcel LUX III SARL (Marcel), aims to merge the company from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange into an unlisted Luxembourg S.A. entity. Marcel, a holding company legally controlled by EQT VIII fund entities and managed by affiliates of EQT AB, Stockholm, Sweden, currently holds a commanding 79% of SUSE’s shares. Together, Marcel and EQT VIII fund entities are referred to as EQT Private Equity. This comes after a long history of going from one owner and organization to another. SUSE, independent from its founding in 1992, was one of the first Linux companies and was acquired by Novell in 2004. Next, Attachmate acquired Novell in 2010. Micro Focus, in turn, acquired Novell in 2014. SUSE was then spun out into an independent division. Then, it was sold to EQT in the middle of 2018. Five years later, here we go again. Before the delisting, EQT Private Equity plans to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to SUSE’s remaining shareholders. Marcel has committed to pay a price of EUR 16.00 per SUSE share, less the gross amount per share of an interim dividend paid by SUSE. This represents a 67% premium on SUSE’s closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023. Both SUSE’s Management and Supervisory Boards have expressed support for the strategic opportunity presented by this delisting. They believe that it will enable SUSE to concentrate on its operational priorities and the execution of its long-term strategy without the pressure of public markets. To facilitate the transaction, SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel, which includes provisions for paying the interim dividend. This interim dividend, to be paid to all shareholders before the settlement of the offer, will assist Marcel in financing its purchase of SUSE shares under the offer and covering specific transaction costs. “The strategic opportunity of taking the company private gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “Our partnership with EQT Private Equity in a private setting has been fruitful before, and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration.” The offer document will be published by Marcel soon, initiating an acceptance period of at least four weeks. Settlement of the offer is anticipated to occur in the first half of October 2023. Subsequently, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE is expected to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Afterward, the company will be taken private. Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE is committed to declaring and paying an interim dividend to all shareholders, regardless of whether they accept the offer. This dividend will be funded through a combination of SUSE’s existing cash and additional borrowing, which is not expected to exceed EUR 500 million. There is, however, no obligation for shareholders to accept the offer. EQT Private Equity assures stock owners that it won't pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders desiring to remain invested in SUSE in its new private setting will have the option to do so. As usual, this transaction is subject to various conditions, including receipt by Marcel of an interim dividend for the SUSE shares held by it, which must be sufficient to fund the offer price for all tendered SUSE shares and certain transaction costs. Considering the nature of the deal and Marcel's dominating stock position, I've no doubt this deal will go through. What that will mean for SUSE remains to be seen. I will say, though, that SUSE manages to keep going despite one ownership and management change after another. I'm sure it will make it through this one too.

Highly Customizable Use a simple json format to configure your options and rebind keys to your liking. If you need more power, you can use Lua to configure the editor further. Colors and Highlighting Micro supports over 75 languages and has 7 default colorschemes to choose from. Micro supports 16, 256, and truecolor themes. Syntax files and colorschemes are also very simple to make. Multiple Cursors Micro has support for Sublime-style multiple cursors, giving you lots of editing power directly in your terminal. Plugin System Micro supports a full-blown plugin system. Plugins are written in Lua and there is a plugin manager to automatically download and install your plugins for you. Common Keybindings Micro's keybindings are what you would expect from a simple-to-use editor. You can also rebind any of the bindings without problem in the bindings.json file. Mouse Support Micro has full support for the mouse. This means you can click and drag to select text, double click select by word, and triple click to select by line. Terminal Emulator Run a real interactive shell from within micro. You could open up a split with code on one side and bash on the other -- all from within micro. And much more!

Yes, Vim is extremely popular, but it&#x27;s still a minority of people who are typing text into computers. The vast majority of people out there are working in editors with \"traditional\" direct, modeless, editing and some variation of \"standard\" (aka Windows&#x2F;Mac) or Emacs-ish keybindings. (Hell, even bash&#x2F;zsh&#x2F;readline -- effectively a single line text editor -- ships with a sub-variation of emacs keybindings by default.)Personally, I use emacs -- when it&#x27;s available. But something like this looks good for lower footprint systems.Anyways, what a strange comment. Nano&#x2F;Pico, etc. have been around since the super early days, I remember using Pico on a 486 back in 1993.

Vim is definitely an insane default editor for anyone who’s not already a skilled fan of it. Micro even has mouse support, making the incredibly common task of “put something at a certain place in this config file” trivial, versus vim where you only need to memorize 12 random key bindings to become more efficient at keyboard cursor control than what a 7-year-old can do with a mouse.I classify vim usage more as a religion than anything else. That doesn’t mean I don’t respect how effective that 0.5% of developers can be with it, but nearly no one I’ve met is as efficient in it as they’d be in VSCode, and about 95% are so unskilled in Vim that they get tripped up by just the basic mode switch and remembering :wq.

All of this on a 486 with megabytes of ram.I never found any TUI editors like those two. reply pavlov 4 hours agoparentThe reason why MS-DOS text editors were so fast and felt powerful is that they used direct access to video memory to render the text-mode UI.Unix is still stuck on the notion of the console being an output stream that emulates a Teletype printer at some level. Full-screen text UIs work around this by adding extra layers for screen manipulation in a stream-oriented device.On MS-DOS, the system APIs were so primitive and limited that everybody (beyond basic CLI tools anyway) just wrote directly against the IBM PC hardware, which conveniently mapped the text-mode screen at a memory location. You could print or move or clear on-screen elements using standard memory operations, and there was no other software layer sitting in between translating the frame buffer, so updates were instant. (No other hardware layers either. The CRT blasted out your characters at most some 15 ms after your update. Today, who knows what’s buffered in the GPU and display itself.)It’s the difference between a multi-user system where you (as the user) get a narrow stream of I&#x2F;O with the shared computer vs. a single-user machine where you truly control the device.

Still, I wonder if micro could be compiled on &#x2F; ported to TinyGo and end up a few hundred KB? It looks like TinyGo can produce some pretty small binaries: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinygo.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;optimizing-binaries&#x2F; reply prmoustache 3 hours agorootparent>That said, for many server-type use cases these days, 11MB isn&#x27;t a huge deal.Yes but that doesn&#x27;t make it a good candidate for a default editor that would be ubiquitous, from small embedded development stuff to servers to desktop.I don&#x27;t mind several MB when the tool offer more than the competition. But what are pico&#x2F;nano lacking really when it comes to editing a few lines in a config file once in a while? It is not like micro is trying to replace visual studio code or emacs either. Or is it? reply kioshix 5 hours agoparentprevSeems like a really modern alternative to my 389K nano. reply oytis 3 hours agorootparentMicro should have been 389M then. reply otterpro 1 hour agoparentprevVim on my macbook is 5MB.

Unless it has a GUI, but then \"terminal-based\" is wrong.I am not a fan of nano, as it is not even qualified to attend the editor war, but this one adds JSON configuration, \"curlbash\" installation, has a JS-dependent website, and generally looks even more awkward than nano. Apparently both nano and this editor have their target audience, as do all those other \"modern\" editors, but observing this triggers the feelings likely similar to those that lead to flamewars: it is painful to observe seemingly inefficient and otherwise awkward tools used by others, and tempting to suggest to look into better options. reply jtriangle 6 hours agoparentYou know what nano&#x27;s good for? Editing a few lines of a config file every now and then.For that purpose, it&#x27;s great, works a peach, and is as at least as good as every other option if not better.And that&#x27;s what 99% of people use it for, because that&#x27;s what 99% of people need in a terminal based text editor. Those people don&#x27;t tend to participate in these sorts of discussions because, well, they&#x27;re probably still trying to figire out how to exit vim after someone told them vim was better than nano. reply mixmastamyk 6 hours agoparentprevnext [–]sudo apt install microNot awkward, it uses keybindings you already know if you&#x27;ve used a PC or Mac in the last 40 years. :-&#x2F; reply berkeleynerd 4 hours agorootparentDefinitely this. I&#x27;m super happy for anyone finding some new level of productivity with vim, emacs, kakoune, etc. but I don&#x27;t want to join an editor cult, not even a CUA one. I just want to edit text from the command line using a familiar set of keystrokes and move on with my life and micro fits the bill. reply prmoustache 5 hours agorootparentprevI think the vim keybinding are the one I have used in the last 35 years. reply mgaunard 6 hours agoparentprev [–] try looking at a \"modern\" text editor; the one which appears to have the highest popularity is visual studio code.It&#x27;s an awful slow mess that cannot stop itself from triggering unsolicited popups, eating all your RAM and inserting characters you didn&#x27;t type.The reality is that this is the reality of programmers today, they want something that does a shitty work for them rather than be in control. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
