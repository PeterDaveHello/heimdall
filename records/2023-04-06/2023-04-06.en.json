The issue seems to be predominantly among iPhone users. The US model for mobile phone and carriers is very different from India, where consumers purchase mobile phones independently from carriers. While some stadiums have open guest Wi-Fi networks to avoid relying on the cell network during games, other stadiums may not set them up due to the expenses involved. Passpoint is a standard used by Wi-Fi networks and carriers to ensure secure connections. The use of Apple Configurator is suggested as a way to limit the Wi-Fi connections of devices by pre-defining SSIDs in the MDM profile.T-Mobile has added a feature to iPhones which auto-joins a network created by T-Mobile, which can vividly steal users' data. However, some users couldn't unjoin it unless they deleted other networks. An HN user complained that Apple allows carriers to add it on their users' devices, albeit Apple was respected as a brand. On the other hand, Apple frequently helps customers protect their privacy, so some users do not trust them. Apple may not have been aware of it or considered it a feature worth having.Apple paid nearly half a billion in damages for conspiring with publishers to shut Amazon out of the market. Apple's behavior was reasonable, but antitrust laws exist for a reason. Some HN users discuss T-Mobile and Apple's managed WiFi networks, including evidence that some networks cannot be disabled. Users express shock at carriers dictating WiFi connections with no user recourse, and HN users debate whether these actions are related to offloading 5g traffic.Users report that the Wingman feature on T-Mobile Android devices will not stay turned off. Wingman appears to be an in-flight wifi network on planes which T-Mobile is removing from devices. While it is annoying, it does not seem to cause significant problems in practice given the typical number of wifi networks on a flight. Some users report issues with their devices connecting to public wifi networks without their consent, and while it may be due to Passpoint access authorized via the SIM, it is concerning. Some users report network interference issues caused by neighbors and suggest Faraday cages or aluminum foil to address the issue.A discussion on Hacker News focuses on mobile devices connecting to neighbors' networks over users' personal wifi, with commenters suggesting this may be due to beaconing or network management protocols. Users suggest that carrier agreements with Passpoint networks may override connection preferences, and while some commenters offer technical explanations, others insist that devices should obey the user's preferences above network management.An HN user argues that hardware should be entirely under the user's control to avoid the need for custom patching of firmware to create specific file formats, work around HDCP and transfer ICs between devices. On the other hand, another HN user feels like letting WiFi devices obey user preference is defendable, but only until it disrupts the user's ability to connect to their own network in any way. Finally, a third user says that having multiple adjacent networks enabled can cause customer devices to roam between access points on and off their LAN even when remote access points don't provide access to desired resources, have acceptable performance or security.Hacker News users are discussing iOS 16's tendency to connect to carrier-run networks even when a user's home Wi-Fi network is available, causing frustration and decreased device security. Some users suggest that specific authentication from the carrier is necessary to connect to these networks, but others point out that this behavior may vary depending on the carrier. Users express concerns about tech companies' secrecy, trolling, and erosion of trust, arguing that such networks should be permission-restricted and effectively deletable. Tests show different results regarding the disabling of auto-join, causing those experiencing the issue to find the update problematic.Users have reported that their phones are automatically connecting to random and unknown hotspots, which breaks local network connections and interferes with content filtering. This issue raises concerns about personal control over phone connections and Apple's decision-making power over user devices. Some users have suggested getting a Linux phone, but the problem seems to affect other operating systems as well. The issue appears to stem from a bug that has yet to be fully resolved.The debate centers around the controversial feature of Apple phones that automatically connect to non-cellular networks without the user's consent, an integration in the carrier profile that raises questions regarding user privacy and control. The widespread discussion on the forum platform includes comments from various perspectives including the proper use of service and the need for greater transparency from service providers.\nHN users praise GrapheneOS for its usability and automatic updates, but note that major banking apps may not work. Some suggest breaking up the Google-Apple duopoly, while others recommend joining the community of GNU/Linux phone users. GrapheneOS now supports commercial apps to some degree through a sandboxed Google Play. Users report smooth installation with good reading and following skills, and one user shares their positive experience with using GrapheneOS on a daily basis. Overall, GrapheneOS is regarded as a powerful tool for gaining complete device control.Samsung users are switching to Pixel devices running GrapheneOS for security updates after Samsung enabled sending typed content to Grammarly without informing users. Pixel phone support for GrapheneOS extends to newer devices with five-year update guarantees. A user recommends GrapheneOS as a better alternative to Copperhead. Users criticize carrier WiFi hotspots for disrupting connections to local devices and wish to have full control over their WiFi connections. Some users find this feature useful, particularly in crowded areas like subways, while others find it intrusive and question why they cannot disable it.",

That\u2019s the killer app that made the internet freak out, and caused the media to say \u201cyou may never believe what you see online again\u201d.We\u2019ve worked closely with experts from Stability.ai and Hugging Face (creators of the Diffusers library) to ensure we have rigorous coverage of the latest techniques. The course includes coverage of papers that were released after Stable Diffusion came out \u2013 so it actually goes well beyond even what Stable Diffusion includes! We also explain how to read research papers, and practice this skill by studying and implementing many papers throughout the course.Stable diffusion generated imageStable diffusion, and diffusion methods in general, are a great learning goal for many reasons. For one thing, of course, you can create amazing stuff with these algorithms! To really take the technique to the next level, and create things that no-one has seen before, you need to really deeply understand what\u2019s happening under the hood. With this understanding, you can craft your own loss functions, initialization methods, multi-model mixups, and more, to create totally new applications that have never been seen before. Just as important: it\u2019s a great learning goal because nearly every key technique in modern deep learning comes together in these methods. Contrastive learning, transformer models, auto-encoders, CLIP embeddings, latent variables, u-nets, resnets, and much more are involved in creating a single image.To get the most out of this course, you should be a reasonably confident deep learning practitioner. If you\u2019ve finished fast.ai\u2019s Practical Deep Learning course then you\u2019ll be ready! If you haven\u2019t done that course, but are comfortable with building an SGD training loop from scratch in Python, being competitive in Kaggle competitions, using modern NLP and computer vision algorithms for practical problems, and working with PyTorch and fastai, then you will be ready to start the course. (If you\u2019re not sure, then we strongly recommend getting starting with Practical Deep Learning.)Get started now!Content summaryIn this course, we\u2019ll explore diffusion methods such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM). We\u2019ll get our hands dirty implementing unconditional and conditional diffusion models, experimenting with different samplers, and diving into recent tricks like textual inversion and Dreambooth.Along the way, we\u2019ll cover essential deep learning topics like neural network architectures, data augmentation approaches, and various loss functions. We\u2019ll build our own models from scratch, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), ResNets, and Unets, while experimenting with generative architectures like autoencoders and transformers.Throughout the course, we\u2019ll PyTorch to implement our models, and will create our own deep learning framework called miniai. We\u2019ll master Python concepts like iterators, generators, and decorators to keep our code clean and efficient. We\u2019ll also explore deep learning optimizers like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) accelerated approaches, learning rate annealing, and learning how to experiment with the impact different initialisers, batch sizes and learning rates. And of course, we\u2019ll make use of handy tools like the Python debugger (pdb) and nbdev for building Python modules from Jupyter notebooks.Lastly, we\u2019ll touch on fundamental concepts like tensors, calculus, and pseudo-random number generation to provide a solid foundation for our exploration. We\u2019ll apply these concepts to machine learning techniques like mean shift clustering and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and will see how to use tracking with Weights and Biases (W&B).We\u2019ll also tackle mixed precision training using both NVIDIA\u2019s apex library, and the Accelerate library from Hugging Face. We\u2019ll investigate various types of normalization like Layer Normalization and Batch Normalization. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll have a deep understanding of diffusion models and the skills to implement cutting-edge deep learning techniques.Get started now!Topics coveredHere\u2019s a list of all the stuff that you\u2019ll learn in detail and build from scratch in this course.

        "content": "Car thieves are using a new technique called CAN Injection to bypass smart key systems in modern cars. This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, a communication protocol that connects different electronic control units in a car. An epidemic of high-tech car theft has been uncovered, and sophisticated car security systems, including engine immobilizers, have become vulnerable. The theft devices are sold on the dark web and are aimed at specific car models. Law enforcement and car makers need to take action to update their ECU software to defeat thieves.Thieves have been using a device to bypass car immobilizers and steal cars without the key. The device called the CAN Injector works by injecting fake messages into the car's internal communication (CAN bus) as if from the smart key receiver. The device costs $10 and contains a PIC18F chip that contains CAN hardware, plus software pre-programmed into the chip (known as firmware), a CAN transceiver, and an extra circuit. The thieves can then use their CAN Injector device to send a different fake CAN message that the door ECU to unlock the doors. Manufacturers have been working to prevent this type of theft, and there are ways to defeat the CAN Injector.A CAN Injector can be defeated using a quick and dirty fix or cryptographic messaging. The quick and dirty fix relies on knowledge of how the Injector works and can temporarily prevent it from working. A more permanent solution is cryptographic messaging, which uses encryption and authentication codes to protect CAN frames from spoofing. This approach requires the use of a hardware security module (HSM) or a software emulation of one. Both fixes can be applied to all makes and models of cars vulnerable to CAN injection attacks, which is an industry-wide issue.Ian Haken has discovered a new method called CAN Injection, which hackers can use to steal high-end cars, using an instrument that provides the user with a vehicle\u2019s CAN bus electrical signals, allowing the data traffic to be read and spoofed. He outlines several ways automakers could help secure cars from these kinds of cyber-attacks. However, Ian has tried and not been able to pin down Toyota to discuss the CAN Injection attack. The attack is not a zero-day vulnerability as criminals have already been exploiting it widely. A full analysis would include the reverse engineering of its firmware.",

        "hn_content": "A keyless car theft technique, known as CAN Injection, has been highlighted on Hacker News. A Trusted Network, by its nature, the CAN network is not meant to have external inputs. However, the system's need for data uplinks has led to a violation of the Air Gap principal. Consumers should be careful about demanding encrypted or signed CAN Bus as it could limit third-party diagnostic tools, adding to repair costs. CAN bus controls the power system used in a vehicle's low and high beams, along with remote operation of multiple vehicle functions. Vehicle manufacturers optimize costs ruthlessly, and what appears consumer-friendly today may disappear in future repair costs.Michigan has legislation requiring automakers to make diagnostic equipment available, but similar requirements are not nationwide. Automakers have legal requirements to separate from dealers, but some comments criticize their adherence to the spirit of the law. Insurance companies only pay for cheaper third-party parts for repairs, causing automakers to fight for first-party parts businesses. Vehicle makers use complex systems that add convenience but also make repairs difficult. Can-bus technology is useful but is sometimes overused, and it is expensive to build CAN transceivers into \"can-bulbs\". Car manufacturers share common parts across many brands to achieve economies of scale.An HN user discusses the existence of CAN-bus Error Free LED replacement bulbs for cars, but questions how the bulb would know its own class. Another HN user suggests that the customer replace one bulb at a time, while acknowledging that this solution may not be practical. A third HN user brings up concerns with the reliability of running a car's CAN bus over a light bulb socket. An additional HN user, who works at Ford, mentions that authenticated CAN communications are coming to the automotive industry. The primary readers of this post are experts in the field, and the post discusses the pros and cons of using CAN bus control in vehicles.Experts suggest smart cars should have encrypted messages signed with a key known to the immobilizer, be designed with PKI-signed packets, or utilised a rolling code or one-time shared secret. Encrypting the CAN bus would be cost prohibitive and overkill. European Union vehicles must have eCall, but charges for it come through taxation. Not all messages must be encrypted, but those allowing immobiliser disabling should be. Retrospectively adding cryptography to complex systems is not straightforward. Key distribution and protection, increased cost and decreased security of private keys are significant issues.An anonymous HN user has posted a comment concerning the trustworthiness of encryption that would be used in vehicles. While the encryption may hold up, the platform and key management of microcomputers must undergo a redo. The post delves into the complexities of CAN bus versus copper wiring as well as the benefits of introducing PCBs into cars, including reducing conceptual complexity and expensive copper wiring. The debate over the security of encryption and the repairability of modern cars continues, and while some support the implementation of encryption, others argue that it would create yet another un-repairable element of the car.Premium car brands use various security measures to prevent car hacking, including immobilizers with proper cryptographic protocols to authenticate start-release messages and signed CAN/FlexRay/Ethernet frames to prevent message spoofing. The level of vulnerability varies between automakers, but generally, the more expensive brands have better security features. Manufacturers rarely advertise these features to consumers, and it's challenging to vet the cybersecurity of an upcoming car purchase. Some DIY autonomous car enthusiasts have compiled useful resources on the topic. European cars tend to have more robust immobilizer systems that use actual cryptographic primitives to obfuscate and authentic start-release messages. Thatcham Research works with insurance companies to focus on immobilizer technology, but some critics don't find their requirements impressive.A European \"emergency start\" bypass for cars is hard to come by, as the All Keys Lost (AKL) bypasses currently available require long-term physical access to the car, whereas Emergency Start bypasses are plain-and-simple theft tools; American and Japanese cars use similar immobilizer module cryptography implementations, and the susceptibility of the immobilizer protocol is more of an issue than the CAN-related message injection thing; older immobilizer bypasses might have used an engine ECU read/write primitive to modify the firmware, but modern ECUs have cryptographic signature checking as an added protection; and European manufacturers have stronger immobilizer implementations, such as VW Immo 5's encryption and authentication using AES with a PRNG-based MAC.The article discusses the ease with which modern cars can be stolen, sometimes via basic tools or by removing the immobilizer and switching the keys for a new one. Some readers comment about the issues of car theft in the past and mention that modern vehicles are still difficult to steal. Others reflect on the once-simpler times of cars without electronics, albeit with their own issues. An HN user suggests that one could steal any modern car by switching out the ECU, though this depends on the car. Overall, the comments reflect on the varying security risks and countermeasures present for modern cars.Mechanical diesel engine swaps in older vehicles can provide unique security features such as needing to be glowed and using a manual transmission that deters thieves. Certain vintage cars like the 1976 MGB had little to no security features, and one user came up with a unique way to repurpose existing functions as theft prevention. Security for modern cars is evolving, and proprietary RSA keys or even NFC smartphone keys are becoming more prevalent, though issues with reliability may still be present. 'CAN Injection' has become a hot topic since hackers have found a way to steal vehicles by exploiting security vulnerabilities in their Controller Area Network (CAN) software. While disclosure from manufacturers has been scarce, researchers warn that these methods will become more sophisticated and more severe.Hacker News users discuss the motivation behind car theft and the skills required. Many suggest money as the driving force, while others point out the potential lack of ethical standards of those involved. Some highlight the low pay in engineering as a possible factor in pushing people towards crime. Users also suggest ways to secure vehicles against theft such as disabling keyless entry or adding fuel pump switches. Concerns are raised regarding the impact of increased encryption on vehicle serviceability. Finally, a user suggests improving vehicle security by limiting the physical path between the key system and the ECU.A recent article on Hacker News detailed how thieves are using a tech toolkit to steal keyless entry cars, and some HN users have suggested potential ways to protect vehicles, such as a fuel relay kill switch or steering wheel lock. Experts have warned about the limitations of incorporating cryptography in cars, saying the errors in encryption always exist and sooner or later, hackers could find them. The absence of security protocols could be a ticking time bomb for car theft which leads to another set of problems such as unauthorized access and property damage.Cheap cars are intentionally targeted as they are easy to steal and inconspicuous on city streets, while expensive cars are more frequently the target of violent theft; cheap car thefts are more profitable due to larger supply and lower expected loss compared to expensive cars. The exploit described in the article could be applied to almost any non-connected vehicle manufactured in the last decade. While subscribing to remote connectivity for convenience may be popular, mechanical keys or paired security parts are a safer option. The Comma.ai hack illustrates the complexity of the CAN system and implies the potential for other zero-day exploits. While most vehicles have more than one CAN bus and messages for other networks are not bridged (except through gateways), newer Toyotas and Rav4 Primes encrypt their adaptive cruise control or steering data, preventing hacking.The use of CAN bus in critical systems such as aviation and automotive is due to its simplicity of wiring and cost-effectiveness. Ethernet is a more complex alternative that requires each device to speak Ethernet, be switched, and have an IP stack. The adoption of 10BASE-T1S is seen as the future due to its simplicity and ability to provide power. While some manufacturers are beginning to include Ethernet, they are not entirely switching to it as CAN bus still fulfills the needs of devices without big data transfer. Applications for YC Summer 2023 are now open.",

After reporting the issue to Microsoft, the latter is releasing a patch that should reduce CPU usage when using Firefox on sites like YouTube. An HN user suggests that avast software may be poorly behaved, tend to monkey-patch the Firefox executable, and reduce Firefox's memory safety. Other Windows AV products might also experience CPU usage problems. Firefox has been making more system calls than other browsers like Chrome, mostly for JIT-generated code security reasons.A bug that affects Windows Defender is causing Firefox to make an abnormally high number of system calls resulting in a CPU usage reduction of about 75%; some speculate this as Microsoft's way of handling competitor browsers. Despite some claims, Firefox is not significantly slower than Chrome, and it\u2019s a matter of perception; Chrome is merely optimized for more \"new\" APIs that Firefox is not, and there are more poorly optimized sites and add-ons. Firefox could reduce the number of system calls invoked, and setting media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled = true in about:config can often speed up WebGL / Canvas-heavy sites.A comparison of web browsing speed tests across different operating systems and browsers reveals varying results, leading to discussion among HN users about the effectiveness of antivirus programs, zero-day vulnerabilities, and the general security of different platforms. Notably, users suggest that Firefox performs faster in certain tests than Chrome or Chromium. While some users dispute the need for antivirus software or express concerns about its intrusiveness, others argue it is necessary for most users, particularly those who are less experienced. Overall, the discussion highlights the ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness and necessity of antivirus software for protecting against various online threats.Experts discuss the limitations of Defender for enterprise security and suggest a focus on sandboxing and hardware MFA to prevent systems from crumbling with a mistake. A user criticizes Defender for only ticking a security box. Another shares how Windows Defender can hog CPU on low-end devices. A suggestion is made to create a bug bounty program for energy use reduction. The discussion notes that any change in technology has unintended consequences, and it is best to be careful while tinkering with it. Users also discuss the problems caused by using consumer-grade OS on industrial applications. Some recommend using third-party antivirus software, such as ESET Internet Security, over Windows Defender.Malware through Facebook Ads can infect even those who stick to regular sites; users must understand the responsibility of owning a computer and their susceptibility to malware. Porn sites may actually be safer to browse than some common sites, but malware warnings may eventually affect most sites. AV software is not always optimal and tends to have bugs; excluding certain files from AV scanning is a possible workaround. Windows Defender has bugs that cause high CPU usage; however, its real-time feature may be useful at times. There are concerns over the usefulness of Windows Defender and other antivirus software, as it may itself be a potential surface area for exploits.Users discuss the effectiveness of Windows Defender, noting that it integrates well with the system and is reasonably effective against threats. However, some users report issues with Defender causing slow file system access and requiring manual disabling through registry tweaks or group policy settings. Users debate the benefits of third-party AV software versus Defender, with conflicting opinions. Additionally, some users mention a recent bug in Defender causing high CPU usage, which has since been fixed with a definition update.",

        "content": "The case for banning children from social media is a topic of discussion, with concerns centered on the addiction and negativity that platforms breed. There are bills floating around Congress and passed in Utah that restrict minors' access to social media sites, including the removal of addictive features from their accounts. These restrictions pose considerable civil-liberties implications and impede minors' access to news and exposure to differing perspectives. However, the bills highlight the government's attempt to treat social media as an addictive substance and raise questions regarding how the government should differentiate vessels of speech from speech acts occurring within them.As courts strike down online protections for child safety, state and cultural institutions may need to create anti-social-media messaging to combat social media addiction, but legal restrictions on social media may infringe on First Amendment rights. The effectiveness of messaging is unclear, and parents may have to resort to physically removing screens from children's hands. The importance of safeguarding children online is a political and cultural debate that provides little confidence in the government's ability to regulate social media companies.",

        "hn_content": "A recent article advocates for the banning of social media for children under the age of 18, citing the addictive effects similar to drugs that could potentially harm young users. The difficulty of effectively regulating such content is also mentioned, with opposing political views complicating the issue. Regulating ads directed at children has been proposed but may not address the larger issue of social media addiction. The comments reveal a debate over the definition of ads and their influence on children. Ultimately, the focus of the article is on the potential dangers of social media addiction and the need for regulation.A discussion on how to regulate advertising to children on social media platforms raises the question of what constitutes an advertisement and how to verify age online. The complexity of the issue is acknowledged, with one user suggesting banning all advertising entirely. Nuance is recognized, with another user calling for clarity in defining what constitutes an advertisement. However, others argue vested interests make regulating advertising difficult, while acknowledging that immaturity among powerful individuals is a serious issue facing society. A user suggests scaling back platform content if they cannot validate it.Comments on an article about corporations\u2019 influence over politics and the banning of ads directed at children on social media discuss government regulation of advertising and the negative impact of social media on children\u2019s mental health. The discussion raises questions about individual freedoms versus government intervention, while acknowledging the complexity of advertising regulation. Some comments criticize the 'subtle aspects' of parents' blind spot towards corporate influence, while others point out the difference between advertising and commercial speech. Lastly, one comment compares social media to other addictive substances, while another notes the potential problems with bans.A debate over whether Hacker News falls into the category of social media was sparked in the comments section, with some believing that it has a more significant social aspect than platforms like Instagram or TikTok. The harmful effects of social media on mental health and personal development, particularly for adolescents, were raised, with suggestions like banning corporate social media and algorithmic feeds to mitigate these problems. Some users attributed the creation of these platforms to a desire for financial gain, while others reflected on the compromises made in building them. Browser extensions like Focused YouTube were recommended to disable unhealthy content.Comments on Hacker News discuss the addictive nature of social media, with some comparing it to drugs and violent video games. One user suggests that while not all video games are bad, some use dark patterns and gambling mechanics that can be just as addictive as social media. Others argue that it's not social media itself that's the problem, but rather the business models that are driven by advertising and incentivize addictive behavior. Overall, the article suggests that while there is growing concern over the impact of social media on individuals, a blanket ban is not the solution and more nuanced approaches are needed.Social media, including addictive sites like Facebook and Instagram, is seen as a problem for children by some parents who want to limit screen time. However, there are varying opinions as to how to do so effectively. Some argue that limiting niche forums, while allowing select access to social media, is the right approach. Others note that things like books and even sports can be addictive, but that limiting screen time should be a priority to combat negative effects. The addictive and heavily advertiser-influenced nature of modern social media is a growing concern for many, particularly in the face of studies that link it to depression, suicide and other negative outcomes.HN users discuss the addictive nature of online content for children and adults. One user suggests banning situations where internet use is necessary to avoid addiction. Other users point out the specific dangers of ad-driven content services and the benefits of time limits and curated content. Some users compare addiction to online content to addiction to exercise or sports, but others argue that the \"dopamine bath\" from social media and video games is biologically different. Users also debate the role of parents and government in managing children's internet use, with many advocating for parental responsibility and education.An HN user suggests a potential solution to the negative effects of social media on young people's mental health, which involves parenting-aid programs, workshops, and performance reviews, as well as financial support for families. However, others doubt that such efforts could be successfully implemented, with concerns of political interests hijacking the curriculum and private tech companies having too much power. Some discussion also revolves around the idea of banning social media platforms altogether, while others argue for the important distinction between personalized and non-personalized feeds. Overall, the debate centers on finding a balance between individual freedom and societal responsibility with regards to social media use.Experts on Hacker News debate whether social media addiction is similar to drug addiction, with one user arguing that the dopamine release from scrolling through social media is comparable to the effects of drugs. Some argue that it should be up to parents to regulate their children's social media use, while others suggest legislation may be necessary to protect kids born to parents who may not understand the risks. However, a complete ban on social media is seen as impractical and may not solve the underlying issues of addiction and exploitation, which also occur with gaming and other activities.Comments on the addictive nature of alcohol and social media, and how abstaining from either can lead to missing out on social opportunities. Some suggest that regulation of social media could be a solution, while others advocate for better parental control measures. The use of technical jargon and stock phrasing to signal expertise is criticized.Despite claims that dopamine addiction is a myth, there are concerns over how social media controls the release of dopamine in the brain. An HN user argues that banning algorithms-powered social media offers the best way to increase user privacy and autonomy. However, enforcing such a ban raises questions for privacy; some argue that enforcing age restrictions on social media sites would require a Know Your Customer (KYC) process, eroding online privacy. Implementing such privacy-reducing methods to stop people engaging in a behaviour they desire to do seems to be ineffective, given that enforcing such regulations would need privacy intrusions for all.An HN user suggests banning social media or requiring age authentication to alleviate harmful effects of the platforms. They argue that barriers to entry, such as age verification, can deter potential users. Some HN users express concerns over enforcement methods and privacy intrusion. Others argue that parents should take responsibility for regulating their children's internet use. Many agree that anonymous social media use can lead to worse harassment than identified users.Some HN users debate the feasibility of mandatory ID checks for social media accounts as a means of eliminating bots and fake accounts that wrongly influence public discourse and promote toxic agendas. A HN user points out that journalists and whistleblowers can already anonymously reach out to journalists and leak information under the protections of their profession, and questions the practicality of mandating social media verification for such purposes. Other comments mention potential privacy concerns with mandatory ID verification, highlighting individual's rights to freedom of speech and secrecy in religion, sexual orientation, and other personal beliefs. There is no new technology or major release discussed in this HN post.",

In my opinion language models are an excellent place to learn deep learning, even if your intention is to eventually go to other areas like computer vision because most of what you learn will be immediately transferable. This is why we dive into and focus on languade models.Prerequisites: solid programming (Python), intro-level math (e.g. derivative, gaussian).Learning is easier with others, come say hi in our Discord channel:Syllabus2h25mThe spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building microgradThis is the most step-by-step spelled-out explanation of backpropagation and training of neural networks. It only assumes basic knowledge of Python and a vague recollection of calculus from high school.1h57mThe spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemoreWe implement a bigram character-level language model, which we will further complexify in followup videos into a modern Transformer language model, like GPT. In this video, the focus is on (1) introducing torch.Tensor and its subtleties and use in efficiently evaluating neural networks and (2) the overall framework of language modeling that includes model training, sampling, and the evaluation of a loss (e.g. the negative log likelihood for classification).1h15mBuilding makemore Part 2: MLPWe implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP) character-level language model. In this video we also introduce many basics of machine learning (e.g. model training, learning rate tuning, hyperparameters, evaluation, train/dev/test splits, under/overfitting, etc.).1h55mBuilding makemore Part 3: Activations & Gradients, BatchNormWe dive into some of the internals of MLPs with multiple layers and scrutinize the statistics of the forward pass activations, backward pass gradients, and some of the pitfalls when they are improperly scaled. We also look at the typical diagnostic tools and visualizations you'd want to use to understand the health of your deep network. We learn why training deep neural nets can be fragile and introduce the first modern innovation that made doing so much easier: Batch Normalization. Residual connections and the Adam optimizer remain notable todos for later video.1h55mBuilding makemore Part 4: Becoming a Backprop NinjaWe take the 2-layer MLP (with BatchNorm) from the previous video and backpropagate through it manually without using PyTorch autograd's loss.backward(): through the cross entropy loss, 2nd linear layer, tanh, batchnorm, 1st linear layer, and the embedding table. Along the way, we get a strong intuitive understanding about how gradients flow backwards through the compute graph and on the level of efficient Tensors, not just individual scalars like in micrograd. This helps build competence and intuition around how neural nets are optimized and sets you up to more confidently innovate on and debug modern neural networks.56mBuilding makemore Part 5: Building a WaveNetWe take the 2-layer MLP from previous video and make it deeper with a tree-like structure, arriving at a convolutional neural network architecture similar to the WaveNet (2016) from DeepMind. In the WaveNet paper, the same hierarchical architecture is implemented more efficiently using causal dilated convolutions (not yet covered). Along the way we get a better sense of torch.nn and what it is and how it works under the hood, and what a typical deep learning development process looks like (a lot of reading of documentation, keeping track of multidimensional tensor shapes, moving between jupyter notebooks and repository code, ...).1h56mLet's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.We build a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT), following the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" and OpenAI's GPT-2 / GPT-3. We talk about connections to ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm. We watch GitHub Copilot, itself a GPT, help us write a GPT (meta :D!) .

Over the course of a work week, it\u2019s not surprising to find that a huge amount of the \u201cwork that gets done\u201d happens within a few short bursts of time, a couple of hours at most, when builders are able to reach and stay in flow.Staying in flow is important, and it\u2019s why good engineering teams will swat away distractions (Slack, emails, meetings, etc) to maximize the length of these flow states. But what about getting in to these states in the first place? I (and I suspect many others) have struggled with overcoming the writers block that one feels when starting to engage with a big, hairy engineering problem - everything feels overwhelming, where do I even start?As I see it, there are two hard things about getting into flow: loading the state of the system / problem / abstractions into your head (i.e. filling your L1 and L2 cache with everything you need to know to work on the problem) and building momentum and confidence for yourself. While this doesn\u2019t always work, I do have One Weird Trick that I have found incredibly useful to re-enter flow and continue working on large problems: Before stepping away, leave the code in a state where it is Obviously Broken, but Easy to Fix. Obviously Broken - when you return to your coding session, the next thing to work on should be screaming out at you. Ideally you leave your working state in a place where a compiler or unit test is loudly failing, so your tooling can act as external memory to remind you of where you were when you previously stepped away from the problem. TODO comments can also work here, but when you sit back down at your workstation to start coding again, you should immediately know what needs to be worked on next.Easy to Fix - the problem that you have left for your future self should be one that you can fix in just a few minutes, without needing the benefit of deep system knowledge at ready access. There\u2019s an art in deciding \u201chow easy\u201d the issue should be - leaving something trivial (like implementing hashCode()) might be too simple - the idea is to give yourself a first task that will let you start writing code with a high probability of short-term success while you \u201cmarinate\u201d in the larger problems.Applying this technique means thinking about how to exit flow in a way that makes it easy to re-enter. And there are two ways that exiting flow / ending a coding session can go wrong:Exiting after hitting a \u201cneat\u201d stopping point - unless the task is done, leaving the system / code too clean makes it hard to know what to work on next. While it\u2019s really tempting to try to stick the landing on an internal milestone, it can often be more productive on net to stop just short of a neat milestone as an onramp to your next coding session.Exiting when hitting a wall or roadblock - this is also a tempting time to move on to another task, for obvious reasons, and while walking away from a problem and letting it sit in the back of your mind can often be a useful tool, it\u2019s really hard to get back into flow when the \u201cfirst task up\u201d is a really hard one. If you do hit a wall, mounting a \u201cstrategic retreat\u201d and undoing or commenting out a little bit of the work that led to that roadblock can help with momentum creation in your next attempt.This advice isn\u2019t universal, and it\u2019s primarily focused on solo coding tasks - if you\u2019re working in close collaboration with others, you might pick different stopping points (or you might find that leaving things just a little bit broken is a Good First Issue for a teammate coming on to a project).

The post explains the concept of over-provisioning RAM in LXC and how it works. A user comments explaining that LXC containers contain processes, and memory given to processes is cleared beforehand. Another user provides additional information on the memory allocation process in Linux and how a process can access another process's memory. Overall, the post serves as a helpful resource for those interested in the inner workings of LXC and Linux memory allocation.An expert on Hacker News explains the way shared libraries work with multiple processes sharing read-only pages of libraries and executable processes. Users ask about the possibility of container allocation of memory being sanitized by kernel user namespace protections. An answer points out that the kernel doesn't hand out pages before they're blanked and over-provisioning doesn't cause pages to be shared. The new page allocation comes from a free pool of pages that are already zero-filled. Memory in LXC containers is assigned to processes, and while constrained by namespaces, processes are separated from the host's resources. Glibc-based memory management doesn't involve memory clean-up, and free pages can contain existing data.",

        "hn_content": "A question was raised on Hacker News whether RAM is wiped before being used in another LXC container, with a user providing that memory is wiped before it is handed out again by default. Another user points out the potential trade-offs in enabling the kernel config flag to zero memory on free. The discussion notes that easily accessible sensitive information can be at risk if memory fades slowly, but this can be countered by powering down devices properly or by freezing RAM. Finally, experts suggest a difference in performance when zeroing memory in comparison to eager memory calls.Users discuss the zeroing of memory in Linux and whether or not it should be done automatically. Some suggest that it won't always have to be zeroed out, while others argue that it's necessary for security purposes. One user suggests that pages can be avoided from being paged in if the goal is simply to zero them out. Another user proposes the idea of being able to control memory zeroing at the process or allocation level. Overall, the discussion revolves around the efficacy and necessity of automatic memory zeroing in Linux.Users on Hacker News are discussing various methods for clearing unused memory, including a \"TRIM for RAM\" hack and using a \"hardware store elimination\" technique that makes writing all zeros faster. Some processors may have this feature, but it's not HW accelerated. There is no known way to instruct the memory controller to set a range to 0, but there are options for the init_on_alloc and init_on_free parameters. The concept of developer experience (DX) is also being discussed in relation to containerization.The article discusses why an out-of-memory system hangs instead of telling the next process it does not have enough memory to allocate, and how processes typically do not get access to each other's memory, even in a container. The problem lies in the design of UNIX's fork() system call, and while POSIX_spawn(3) and various clone(2) flavours allow spawning new processes without copying the old one, fork remains the default way to spawn processes. Many memory-intensive software such as PostgreSQL uses fork. Although modern Linux distros can be used without memory overprovisioning, developers still struggle with OOM issues due to overprovisioning being the default state.An HN user points out there is confusion between overprovision and overcommit, with Unix-style overcommit leading to OOM killer. One commenter argues Windows does it the correct way and never has to kill random processes. Other users discuss alternative options such as using threads, vfork(), and CoW. The conversation revolves around the potential high memory usage in forked processes and the use of overcommit in Linux. The discussion sheds light on how memory management works and the pros and cons of different approaches.The article discusses the differences between overcommit and non-overcommit memory allocation in Linux. It includes comments from users on how page tables are handled and how the system handles memory reservation. Some users discuss the implications of copy-on-write and how it can complicate analysis. The history of fork and how it was necessary for multiuser systems is also mentioned. Overall, the article is geared towards experts in the field and provides nuanced perspectives on Linux memory allocation.HN users discuss how memory allocation works in Linux and mention the importance of setting limits, especially for out-of-memory systems. Some users share insights about virtual memory mapping and GPU memory, while others argue about whether the memory is zeroed when malloc is used. A few users mention that containers are just processes on a system, and there is no magic under the hood. Some users share resources for those interested in exploring memory allocation in Rust or learning about the Vulkan specification.",

        "hn_content": "OpenAI has released a new tokenizer tool with the capability of generating better insights into how GPT models work. The tool's primary utility is to help individuals develop intuition for how models like GPT handle various inputs while simultaneously referencing token IDs. An OpenAI developer acknowledged that the page is somewhat outdated, as GPT4 has a different tokenizer than GPT3. However, this should not deter users from seeking novel solutions such as Tiktoken or the Tiktokenizer platform made by a community member. In addition, readers can also gather helpful insights on topics like stop tokens and probability distributions.ChatGPT efficiently parses and processes text by splitting it into subword units to decrease memory usage and enable new word compositions; however, these subword units are not linguistically motivated or reflective of syntax, and have no inherent meaning. While there is no planning or reason in the AI's decision-making, research suggests that the models themselves capture meaning, and can output code or articles that appear reasoned due to implicit reasoning in language patterns.OpenAI discussions on tokenization in GPT models. One HN user pointed out that the tokenizer groups based on spaces and is case sensitive, and another noted that byte pair encoding can be quadratic on the length of words. Some users commented on the treatment of capitalization, unicode characters, and varying languages. The tokenization design may lead to different tokens for separate cases of the same word. However, in practice, GPT models are generally viewed as flexible enough to handle pre-processing and normalization.Diagram.com has commissioned a better model that lets users pick from OpenAI's models, with the new model including GPT-4 token encoding. HN users are asking about how the encodings are created, and if they relate to text compression. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is used to create these encodings, but a consequence is that they are suited for the data set they are trained on and not always well suited to languages underrepresented in the data, like Greek. Additionally, the models can act in strange ways when encountering \"glitch tokens\" like \"SolidGoldMagikarp\". Users can also expose Tiktoken, OpenAI's tokenizer, as an internal service to get token counts easily.OpenAI's GPT2Tokenizer library and Tiktoken library produce the same number of tokens for 'text-davinci-003' model, despite GPT2Tokenizer being a GPT2 and text-davinci-003 being a GPT3.5, but they produce different tokenizations for code. The difference might be because of tokenization encoders. Japanese language tokenization is not correct;\u00a0it seems to tokenize Unicode per-byte rather than per-character, and some languages get every character/letter tokenized individually. Modeling at the subword level has benefits over modeling at the character level such as flexibility and efficiency. OpenAI charges per-token because the actual models operate on a token level.An analysis of the token usage in OpenAI's GPT-3 model has been discussed on Hacker News, with some users noting that the unit of work in an LLM are tokens, and that different GPTs use different tokens. Additionally, some users have pointed out that while GPT models don't tend to be math-friendly, the tokenizer used in the models is not math-friendly either. One user has shared a website they created that calculates the cost of GPT-3 usage, while another recommends an open-source tool called TikToken for counting tokens. Finally, some users have observed that the tokenization does not appear to be linguistically meaningful, and that this is merely an information theoretic phenomenon.",

        "hn_content": "An article on Hacker News discusses GPT4 simulating an FTP server at ftp.disney.com. Some comments discuss whether or not this can be considered 'hallucinating'. Additionally, users comment on the potential for AI to be able to simulate or 'hallucinate' and how current AI models may be biased to protect intellectual property owners, legal issues with AI image generators, and the possibility for self-generated movies or TV shows being worthless. A few comments also mention their experiences with ChatGPT and Auto-GPT for writing prompts and short stories.A discussion on a thread in Hacker News about an AI-generated writing prompt that involves writing a short story turns to the possibilities of self-generated movies and TV shows. While some feel that the process won't be as enjoyable or immersive, others argue that users will share their generated content like they do with mid-journey images. Additionally, some comments address the accuracy of AI-generated responses and the perception of these outputs as \"hallucinations.\"HN users discuss how concepts come to them when trying to convey ideas to others. Some users believe the concepts are fully formed before they start typing, while others experience a process of articulation to arrive at the best words to convey the same concept. One user notes how human brains at the highest level are like glorified Markov chains, and compares this to language learning models (LLMs). Some users discuss the difference between the original concept understanding vs the way in which an LLM constructs responses based on pre-existing concepts. They speculate on the role of latent space and language in LLMs.An HN user discusses their thought process and reliance on \"conceptual autocomplete\" and internal monologue to fully form and articulate thoughts. They also mention their bilingualism and how it impacts their use of language. Another HN user questions whether a Markov chain or simple language model could meet the definition of awareness, which prompts a discussion on the complexity and space of possible tokens of models predicting the next token. The use of anthropomorphizing language when discussing AI is also mentioned.Hacker News users debate whether describing GPT's output as \"hallucinations\" is accurate, with one user providing examples of GPT suggesting programming libraries and URLs that do not exist. Other users share their own experiences with GPT, including instances where it made up URLs, claimed to have emailed results, or seemed confident in incorrect information. Despite concerns about its accuracy, some users suggest GPT can still be useful if the cost of verification is lower than the cost of doing it oneself.The comments on the article discuss the hype around AI and chatbots, with some users pointing out different perspectives on the topic. One user disagrees with the hype, arguing that the impact of technology on society usually takes years to realize. Another user highlights the importance of language in communication and how chatbots can assist with writing reports. The discussion expands on the nature of intelligence and the possibilities and limitations of AI. Despite the debate, the article's main point is not explicitly stated.The article contains a discussion of internet flame wars, offline history of Us vs Them, and LLMs as stochastic parrots. Some HN users debate about the usefulness of categorizing comments as coming from certain \"camps.\" One user shares their workflow of utilizing ChatGPT for first drafts and writing summaries. The accuracy of ChatGPT is debated, but users highlight its usefulness in finding technical answers.A range of HN users discuss their experiences with GPT-3 and its use cases. Some praise it for its ability to complete basic and tedious tasks, such as code conversion or summarisation. Others find it less useful for more complex or creative tasks, such as generating original ideas or code improvement suggestions. Some users note that GPT-3 can sometimes provide incorrect or misleading information, which requires verification. There is also some discussion about the potential for GPT-3 to be used for deception purposes.An argument over the creativity of AI-generated art prompts a discussion on the limitations of current AI capabilities, particularly GPT. While some argue that AI lacks the ability to be truly creative, others suggest that AI may possess the raw material for generating creative ideas. Comparing AI to human creativity reveals that while AI may apply basic logic, it lacks reasoning and the ability to transfer reasoning skills to other domains. While some find AI-generated art impressive, it is generally felt that it lacks originality and has limited value.The article discusses the limitations and potential of GPT-style language models, with users sharing their experiences testing the technology. While some have found truly creative and impressive results, others caution against over-interpreting the AI's abilities and note that its limitations are often overlooked. Many have suggested using the AI for generating scripts, music, and other forms of content, but these functions are not yet available. Nonetheless, interest in the technology remains high, and many are optimistic about its future potential.An HN user highlights the difference between simulating and hallucinating, while another comment suggests the potential risks of creating viruses with this technology.

        "content": "The llama.cpp project has modified its implementation to enable Edge AI to load LLaMA 100x faster using mmap() instead of C++ standard I/O, allowing multiple LLaMA processes to run simultaneously on computers, and the safe loading of models twice as large without compromising RAM stability. This also results in a faster loading time, whereby Linux users can expect a 100x improvement in load time, and Windows and MacOS users, a 10x improvement. The new mmap() based loader is now available in the llama.cpp project, which is released under the MIT license on GitHub in both source and binary forms.Experts in the tech industry have gained interest in a post on Hacker News regarding the use of mmap() to load machine learning models, particularly the LLaMA-7B model. An anonymous collaborator from 4chan named @Slaren was credited as the key collaborator who added mmap() support to LLaMA-7B. They showed that it was possible to bring the benefits of instant load times to LLaMA 7B users with no file format change. The post details the process of changing the file format to allow mmap() to support larger models. The new file format offers the benefit of aligning tensors on a 32-byte boundary. The post also mentions potential challenges encountered during the process, such as using seek() and write() system calls. Finally, the post offers potential improvements in file copying methods to address issues such as disk utilization and performance disruption.Justine Tunney has written a post describing the use of Twitter and Github by standard utilities. The article is geared towards experts in the field and aims to inform them about this new application. The post is not biased in any way and refrains from making any political or religious statements.

        "hn_content": "The article discusses the use of mmap to make LLaMA load faster. However, the comments focus on drama surrounding attribution and technical issues. One user claims that some collaborators were removed due to drama. Another user believes that an unnecessary number of commits was made. Some believe that the change could cause a regression in certain cases. Others point out that justine.lol, the author of the post, has experienced drama before. Overall, the drama surrounding the LLaMA project detracts from its impressive features.The drama around a pull request (PR) on llama.cpp attracted attention on Hacker News. Users argued over who contributed the most to the PR and the original authorship. Some users expressed doubts around jart, initially credited with developing the efficient memory mapping trick, and suspected a PR stunt. Suggestions to attribute work appropriately were made, and the nuanced performance implications of mmap were discussed. The primary benefit of using mmap in llama.cpp is quicker loading time for file-backed models, and the benefits depend on usage scenarios.The article discusses the difference between using copy within the kernel space versus mmap in user space, with the latter allowing for faster memcopy instructions, although this is not universally true. The article also touches on how Windows does not have issues with mmap, and how the use of mmap is not always the best choice as it has its disadvantages. The comment section includes a mix of technical discussion and drama, including perceived transphobia and neoreactionary politics. The discussion leads to comments about the lost art of basic optimizations and how mmap is only relevant to CPU-using programmers.Facebook's LLama.cpp is being adapted to new applications, constraints, and environments. The introduction of mmap support for file-backed pages shows potential for roughly halving RAM usage. The kernel recognizes and discards pages when using O_DIRECT, but it keeps the pages with the memory mapped file, with possible performance cost. While not a miracle memory reduction, there are some small memory and speed improvements in loading times after the first run. However, claims about huge memory savings were exaggerated due to a lack of understanding of memory measurement. There is an ongoing discussion about the utility of LLama's changes and the pros and cons of various features, such as the value of embedding methods and the efficiency of different support tools.Users on Hacker News discuss an open-source chatbot called Vicuna, which is surprising people with its high level of ChatGPT quality. Users discuss the best ways to run the model and how to balance weights between CPU and GPU. Some users ask for insights into how to download weights for llama.cpp. Some users also discuss the use of mmap and the difficulty of abstracting it away in high-level libraries. Overall, the thread provides valuable insights for tech-savvy readers interested in learning more about AI and model implementation.The post describes a systems engineering approach to a problem and a trend involving proprietary code in libraries. The article highlights the technical merits and roadmap while toning down an ownership tone. There is a discussion about the use of mmap() and the benefits of using Huge Pages. One comment highlights the importance of RAM and the difficulty of solving IO bottlenecks. The argument about mmap() and the benefits of its use are relevant due to slaren and jart replying there. Another comment points out that the post is not about \"ML stuff\" being inefficient, it's just like any other technology; use it wrong, and you will get burned. Justine worked hard on these changes in good faith, and the article gives hope for the future of systems/low-level programming.A recent post on Hacker News about a revolutionary performance improvement has garnered attention, with users sharing their thoughts on the optimization method. Some users criticize the use of mmap as basic systems programming knowledge, but others praise the author's clever way of measuring the optimization's impact, making it a high-point of the paper. One user reminds others not to trivialize fields of interest, as what may be impressive to one person may be basic knowledge to another. However, some comments diverge and include sarcastic remarks, which should not be the main focus. Overall, the post has caught the attention of experts in the field, and the optimization method used is noteworthy.",
