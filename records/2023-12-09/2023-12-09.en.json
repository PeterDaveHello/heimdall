Beeper, the startup that reverse-engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users, is experiencing an outage, the company reported via a post on X on Friday. And Apple is to blame, it seems. Users, including those of us at TechCrunch with access to the app, began seeing error messages when trying to send texts via the newly released Beeper Mini and messages are not going through. The error message reads: “failed to lookup on server: lookup request timed out” spelled out in red letters. Image Credits: screenshot of Beeper Mini error In a response to a question on Reddit as to whether or not the app was broken, a Beeper team member had earlier replied, “Report a problem from the app, give us a chance to look into it.” However, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky responded to TechCrunch’s inquiry about Beeper Mini’s status by pointing us to the X post acknowledging the outage, and providing more detail. Asked if possibly Apple found a way to cut off Beeper Mini’s ability to function, he replied, “Yes, all data indicates that.” We don’t know what this means for the future of Beeper Mini’s efforts, unless Beeper’s engineers are able to work around the problem somehow. Migicovsky, who previously founded the smartwatch Pebble, has argued that Beeper Mini wasn’t just beneficial for Android users who wanted to finally join their iMessage friends’ group chats, but that it increased security for iPhone users, too. In an interview ahead of Beeper Mini’s launch, the founder explained that green bubble texts were unencrypted. “That means that anytime you text your Android friends, anyone can read the message. Apple can read the message. Your phone carrier can read the message. Google… literally, it’s just like a postcard. Anyone can read it. So Beeper Mini actually increases the security of iPhones,” he had told TechCrunch. Apple, on the other hand, sees iMessage as one of the key tools for locking in users to its ecosystem, which is why it won’t launch an iMessage app for Android. While there was some hope that EU regulations would force it to make iMessage more interoperable, news this week indicates that iMessage will get a reprieve from those rules because the service is not popular enough with business users. That means Apple has no reason not to try to shut down Beeper Mini, if it could. Migicovsky is none too pleased with that turn of events. “I would be very interested to hear why they think that making security worse for iPhone users makes sense,” he said. “If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is — if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they try to kill a service that enables iPhones to send encrypted chats to Android users? With their announcement of RCS support, it’s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?,” he asked. Founded in 2020, Beeper’s team had originally been working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator, which was renamed Beeper Cloud this week as Beeper Mini went to launch. The latter uses new technology that allows Android users to text iMessage users as if they were also texting from an iPhone for just $1.99 per month. That means blue bubbles in the group chat, not green ones. Because the startup was no longer using a middleman — like a Mac server relaying messages, as other iMessage-to-Android apps employ — it would essentially appear to Apple’s servers that Beeper Mini’s messages were coming from a device that runs iMessage natively. It’s unclear, then, how Apple was able to cut off Beeper Mini’s access. What this means for Beeper Mini’s future is uncertain. “We’ll evaluate options,” Migicovsky said. Update, maybe?

The number of Apple apologists that have crawled out to say \"see? I told you so!!\" is saddening. It is a bit dicey when you&#x27;re charging for it, but since Mini was entirely client-side it would be feasible for a free version to exist.Apple claims iMessage is E2EE, do we have proof they aren&#x27;t siphoning the messages from the client once it&#x27;s been decrypted? The level of trust we have to have for Apple is approximately the same for any other iMessage client. Obviously Mini was using the encryption properly else it wouldn&#x27;t have worked to begin with. Of course, it&#x27;s very unlikely Apple is doing that. Just putting the thought out there.One other point raised that I saw was about how iMessage costs Apple money to run, and non-product owners should not have access since they haven&#x27;t contributed. This falls apart if you own any Apple devices. Myself for example owns a Macbook, but an Android phone. Am I not allowed to use iMessage? I paid the toll. reply kelnos 12 minutes agoparent> Where is the hacker spirit here?I&#x27;m torn on this. Is it following the hacker spirit to get more people plugged into Apple&#x27;s closed ecosystem? Maybe? Maybe not? Reverse engineering a proprietary protocol is certainly hacker-y. But building a business around that -- essentially charging people to put more load onto someone else&#x27;s infrastructure, who have to bear the costs (even a rich behemoth like Apple) -- I&#x27;m not sure that qualifies. If we were talking about some open source project that was releasing this app to F-Droid, maybe it&#x27;d be more clear?> The number of Apple apologists that have crawled out to say \"see? I told you so!!\"I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s Apple apologism, that&#x27;s just \"duh, obviously Apple is going to try to shut them down, and probably succeed\". It&#x27;s lame. It&#x27;s just as lame as when AOL kept breaking Gaim&#x2F;Pidgin&#x27;s ability to talk AIM&#x27;s OSCAR protocol. But acknowledging that Apple is going to pull something like that isn&#x27;t apologism, it&#x27;s just stating reality.(As for the AOL&#x2F;AIM example, I think reverse-engineering OSCAR was actually hacker-spirit-y, as AIM was a free service open to anyone, just they didn&#x27;t feel like supporting Linux users, as was the SOP of many companies at the time. Linux users were a fairly small percentage of users, so it wasn&#x27;t a big thing. But there are tons of Android users; more than iOS users, globally, even. That&#x27;s not really the same, to me.)In the context of the overwhelmingly saturated messaging space, I think it&#x27;d be a lot more hacker-y to bring something like Signal up to the usability standards of iMessage, Whatsapp, Telegram, etc., and evangelize the hell out of it to get people out of closed platforms. Even Signal isn&#x27;t perfect there, since they refuse to enable federation in the protocol, and only release updates to their server-side software a long time after it&#x27;s been running in production. But it&#x27;s certainly better than getting more people hooked in Apple&#x27;s walled garden. reply crazygringo 8 hours agoparentprev> Where is the hacker spirit here?The hacker spirit is the fun of reverse engineering. The hacker spirit is about personal use.It&#x27;s not expecting to be able to turn it into a business, or a popular app, that wouldn&#x27;t quickly be shut down. That&#x27;s just common sense.> Myself for example owns a Macbook, but an Android phone. Am I not allowed to use iMessage? I paid the toll.Of course you can. It&#x27;s sitting there on your Mac where you can use it as much as you like. reply fauigerzigerk 2 hours agorootparent> Of course you can. It&#x27;s sitting there on your Mac where you can use it as much as you like.For what?I own a Mac an iPhone and an iPad but iMessage and FaceTime are entirely useless to me because no one I communicate with on a regular basis uses Apple devices. Same thing with various iCloud sharing features. Not using the family sharing offers is entirely uneconomical as well.So what happens is that I gravitate to other ecosystems. I use WhatsApp. I upload all my photos to Google Photos. I mirror my iCloud Drive to Google Drive to share and collaborate with people on various things.I have enabled Apple’s advanced data protection for end to end encryption but it’s entirely farcical as my stuff is all over the place anyway.Almost everything Apple does in terms of software and services is useless to me. They are not locking me in. They are locking me out.I’m paying for their excellent hardware, the m-series CPUs in particular, but I’m using my “spare” Pixel phone more often because the software suits me better.I appreciate a lot of things that Apple does but it’s only a question of time until some other ARM based hardware catches up enough for me to stop overpaying Apple for software I can’t use anyway. reply gms 1 hour agorootparentWhat’s the problem here? Seems like you found fine alternatives. reply fauigerzigerk 1 hour agorootparentMy problem is that I&#x27;m paying for something that could be far more useful than it is, and I haven&#x27;t actually found satisfactory alternatives. For instance, I haven&#x27;t found an end-to-end encrypted and still user friendly cloud option for my photos.Apple&#x27;s problem is that they are selling less to me than they could and risk losing me as a hardware customer as well.Now, I totally get their strategy. It&#x27;s a bet that net net they are locking more people in than they are locking out. It&#x27;s hard to tell whether or not this is paying off for them. Not even Apple can know the counterfactuals. replydzikimarian 6 hours agorootparentprevNo. Hacker spirit is owning your machine to its full extent. For fun, for profit or just for mayhem.Apple using instant messaging, where no meaningful innovation happened for decades to build their moat is pathetic and disgusting. reply tedunangst 5 hours agorootparentIf your mayhem requires communicating with third party servers, who owns those computers? reply colinsane 2 hours agorootparentthen to OP’s “where’s the hacker spirit” question: the answer would be “the hacker spirit is to replace iMessage with anything less controlled”, right? that’s still equally as subversive against The Powers in the sense that “hacker spirit” implies any form of subversion. reply rezonant 2 hours agorootparentJust like how all we needed to do to replace Facebook in its heyday was to make a better Facebook! Remember Diaspora? Any day now its going to dethrone the king and I&#x27;ll be able to see all my friends updates on Diaspora!The social graph lock in problem is well documented and well understood. If most people use a certain solution (in this case texting, and particularly in regions where its dominant such as the US) then attempts to make a replacement solution whose success depends on mass adoption has an exponentially more difficult time in achieving adoption, because there&#x27;s no incentive for users early on (because the social graph isnt there).At least in the US, texting has a ton of \"gravity\" compared to other forms of messaging because it is built in to every phone and entirely free with your phone plan, so every user knows they can reach every other person they meet via texting.New platforms gain critical mass more due to circumstance and luck than anything else. Or, such as the case with TikTok, via deep pockets and relentless advertising. reply colinsane 28 minutes agorootparent> The social graph lock in problem is well documented and well understood.i don&#x27;t actually think it is. i don&#x27;t know _anyone_ who uses just a single messaging app (and thereby a single protocol-level social graph). i have some mental map in my head: \"if i want to reach friend A, i do it on Signal. friend B: Discord. friend C: SMS&#x2F;tel&#x2F;PSTN. friend D: Matrix\". i think this is a pretty common experience these days: i&#x27;d hazard that my mix of 4 apps is on the _small_ side.i admire Beeper, JMP.chat, and other groups trying to improve messaging via better abstractions. i think it&#x27;d be cool if they could maintain iMessage support, i also think it&#x27;s not critical to their success. the pain points caused by that graph problem you point to is 1) maintaining that mental map and 2) coordinating large group chats. i don&#x27;t see that the client-side&#x2F;Beeper-style solution to this is notably worse if they support only 29 protocols instead of 30: for as long as my peers are reachable by more than one messaging app, the odds of bridging between them isn&#x27;t radically different. reply onethought 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat is the meaningful innovation in messaging that happened elsewhere? reply ed_elliott_asc 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is a bit strong, “disgusting” conjures up other things for me. reply tibbydudeza 1 hour agorootparentprevUse WhatsApp - it works on both platforms. reply krrrh 1 hour agorootparentThe hacker spirit uses Signal. Promoting WhatsApp over the more open community-supported alternative is worse than gloating over Beeper. reply fauigerzigerk 26 minutes agorootparentI would very much prefer to use something other than WhatsApp (especially as Facebook has banned me for life from all their other apps), but my attempts keep failing.My wife won&#x27;t use Signal because it includes a crypto wallet and crypto transactions are taxable.Matrix&#x2F;Element would be my preferred option, but it causes so many security or encryption related issues that it has scared off everyone I tried using it with. Nobody knows what to do with the incessant popups demanding to \"verify\" something or other. Nobody (including myself) knows why older messages often can&#x27;t be decrypted.Telegram is less secure than WhatsApp.Threema is not free, which makes it difficult for me to ask people to install it. It&#x27;s not open source either.iMessage is Apple only.So what&#x27;s left besides WhatsApp? reply kelnos 6 minutes agorootparent> My wife won&#x27;t use Signal because it includes a crypto wallet and crypto transactions are taxable.I think the crypto wallet is lame, and am disappointed the Signal folks decided to integrate something like that, but it&#x27;s entirely opt-in. If she doesn&#x27;t want to worry about being taxed on crypto transactions, she can simply not use that part of the app. I actually forgot for a second it was there until you brought it up, and I&#x27;m a daily Signal user. reply baq 6 minutes agorootparentprevI wish watching ads on Facebook was treated as personal income that you have report to IRS.

Problem is public mindshare and adoption. reply paulmd 8 hours agorootparentprevIt’s also at severe risk of ruining the fun for numerous other hacker-spirit communities like hackintosh or opencore. Apple can come down on this in ways that potentially make it much more difficult for hackintosh to operate, or for people to update their legitimate apple systems after the end of official support. Which was pointed out in those threads too.See also geohot taking some other PS3 exploits that were already published and combining them into a piracy kit that caused Sony to come down on them and patch the exploits, ruining it for the rest of the homebrew community.There’s a reason homebrew people try to keep it low-key, it doesn’t take many assholes to ruin it for everyone. Let alone turning it into an app on their own platform lmao.A decent number of other hobbies also involve some collective good-behavior and self-control lest the hammer come down for everyone.

Fly below radars, and you will have your small joys for indefinitely long.This raises the question: is that a space worth inhabiting?

Netflix (iMessage &#x2F; texting apps) has Stranger Things (texting) and Hulu (\"alternatives\" like Whatsapp et al) do not.As an Android user, in theory I shouldn&#x27;t care about iMessage. However, because of the way that iMessage creates schisms, miscommunications, lost communications, broken texting experiences and more between my Android friends and my iPhone friends, I have to. I would like the texting features of these phones to interoperate so we can all text together in peace.I wrote up a scenario (user story?) that I think helps to explain the problems I think should be solved that seem to fly over so many people&#x27;s heads, especially when they advocate for over-the-top messaging apps like Whatsapp to solve the problem (particularly in the US context): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38578101 reply berkes 2 hours agorootparentprevOne of these is inherent, dictated by technological abilities.

They have decrypted messages in response to law enforcement requests. reply mlindner 4 hours agorootparentYou left off the point that that only true if you had iCloud backup of iMessages enabled.

And also it&#x27;s worth noting that Apple forbids you from using any cloud backup system other than theirs. reply aryaneja 2 hours agorootparentYou seem to have written a very misleading comment. Apple is offering privacy minded folks two options:1. Don&#x27;t turn on iCloud Backups and receive E2EE on your messages 2. Turn on iCloud Backups AND advanced data protection and recieve E2EE on your messagesThis is not some kind of nefarious plan on their end. Any user service will have a vulnerability on the user end of back-ups. For instance, Whatsapp backups will also have their keys available to Apple&#x2F;Google. They need to offer this as for most users, the risk of losing their whole digital lives because they forgot their passwords outweights E2EE. For users who find that important, they have the two options listed above. Sounds like an appropriate trade-off to me. reply the_gipsy 1 hour agorootparentJust because WhatsApp does it too, doesn&#x27;t make it right.These apps are not e2ee if almost every user has in effect encryption disabled. reply aryaneja 57 minutes agorootparentWhich app would qualify in your case? Signal suffers from the same client-side problem. reply ycombinatrix 44 minutes agorootparentnot by default, which is a massive difference. reply aryaneja 41 minutes agorootparentI am not sure what the answer is here. What you are arguing for will hurt regular users who will lose their digital lives if they lose their passwords.Signal will be backed-up on iCloud _by default_ and client side will be an issue. reply modeless 2 hours agorootparentpreviPhones with iCloud backup enabled without ADP are almost certainly the majority. I believe this is essentially the default configuration. Even if you disable backups or enable ADP Apple almost certainly still has most of your messages from the other end of the conversation. It is false advertising to claim your service is E2EE without any disclaimer when in reality you collect the keys to the majority of messages and decrypt them at the request of law enforcement. reply aryaneja 56 minutes agorootparentI have addressed your concern in my comment> They need to offer this as for most users, the risk of losing their whole digital lives because they forgot their passwords outweights E2EE.There is no clear trade-off that is an option. reply tick_tock_tick 1 hour agorootparentprevSounds like you&#x27;re just confirming Apple tries very hard to make sure it&#x27;s not E2EE. reply katbyte 54 minutes agorootparentTurning on advanced data protection is not hard. reply fsflover 40 minutes agorootparentprev> Apple is offering privacy minded folks two optionsHere is the explanation why it&#x27;s completely impractical and therefore doesn&#x27;t provide actual privacy, along with other anti-privacy configurations: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37875370 reply vezycash 2 hours agorootparentprev>Apple forbids you from using any cloud backup solution other than theirsIf this is true, how is that legal? reply modeless 2 hours agorootparentWhat would make it illegal, short of antitrust law? replydylan604 8 hours agoparentprevIt has nothing to do with a lack of spirit.

You could tell this would happen, notably because they were selling a product on top of a retro-engineered API, and it made quite the noise. Even if they hadn&#x27;t closed it at a technical level, they&#x27;d probably have done it at a legal level.And to point out the obvious, Beeper was also closed source.

Especially considering they funds most of our paychecks. Everyone is affected by ads and convincing yourself that you aren&#x27;t makes you more vulnerable to them.I think the problem comes from people thinking ads exclusively are about selling things that have a monetary value. But ads sell ideas. Often that idea is that you should buy something, but sometimes it is a preference like a politician or a celebrity in their latest scandal or rise to fame. Ads can be good too, like public service announcements.

In fact, not allowing for you to unsubscribe actually goes counter to the safety claim because it teaches people to ignore your emails.> In order to share information quickly and efficiently with faculty, staff, GEs, and students, the university uses email as its official form of communication.

I think we are incredibly far from that breaking point, and what Google is doing is chasing growth for their shareholders more than anything else, especially at the end of the free money era.The platform itself may be replaced but the incredible result of the YouTube platform is that there are millions of excellent creators who are making a living by making their videos, and even making enough to keep raising the bar on their work.It&#x27;s not a given that growing such a swelling stream of creative work will ever again be possible if this one dies out. YouTube was in the right place at the right time with the right subsidization available while they made the systems work at scale, and scale them up to insane hyper scale levels. This happened because of the advertising bubble, which is showing heavy signs of stress especially in the last few years. Society is already pushing back against the data collection that makes advertising at these scales as lucrative as it is, and if the bubble finally pops it&#x27;s possibly it&#x27;ll never inflate this way again.This is why it&#x27;s important to support the small creators you enjoy in some way. Direct contribution is certainly the best of them all. Sure this might not be relevant for superstar YouTubers, but take for example Technology Connections. Alec is an amazing communicator who puts insane effort (full time) into producing super informative videos about electronics and engineering. reply rezonant 2 hours agorootparentprev> and the overall quality (in terms of content value, not production value) would also probably be higherThis is pretty questionable. Quality takes time. If you need an income to pay your rent, 40 hours or more of your work week are taken up. That leaves a few hours before dinner and sleep to work on your videos (since in this hypothetical, it is \"literally impossible\" to make money on your videos).Of course you could work on the weekend, and many do. But let&#x27;s not forget that making videos is work, and it&#x27;s important to do the things, you know, we invented weekends for. Like spending time with your family, reading a book, or playing a video game. How entitled this content creator must be to have a weekend. This is of course assuming that the creator&#x27;s day job is a traditional one-- more than likely they work partial days 7 days a week at varying hours as is the norm for crappier jobs.That 40 hours gives you enough income to pay your expenses, but unfortunately, for most people, doesn&#x27;t give you the income you need to get a real camera, so you&#x27;re just using the webcam that you already had on your computer.The audio is terrible and the video looks like it came out of the early days of YouTube, but somehow that qualifies as \"high production values\".Sometimes it&#x27;s easy to lose sight of reality when working in a highly paid specialized field like engineering.> In many ways it&#x27;d probably be far better for the world if making videos was not perceived as being profitable.

Do you feel it provides value to you?There are an awful lot of small science educators on YouTube. They are doing the work to inspire people to get into the sciences. Is that not valuable? Those people have an outsized dependency on the ad revenue and patreon income they receive so they can keep making videos that are accurate and engaging.

Now of course there may not be much point reply rezonant 7 hours agorootparentprevIf you think about it, it&#x27;s actually not even a technological requirement. It&#x27;s plenty possible to use an Android system service which maintains a connection for Beeper Mini persistently from the phone. After all that&#x27;s what GCM does too. Yes, it would require backgrounding permissions, but that is something pretty justifiable for a messaging app, and when using the right UI practices, you can explain this to the user before they grant it.So yes, it&#x27;s absolutely possible for this app to be 100% client side and I wish Beeper would&#x27;ve done that to start, if for no other reason than to dispel the misinformation around that BPNs is somehow required for the core operation of the app.To be fair, they probably thought making this explicit in their How It Works article would be sufficient. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentIs this actually still possible without (or even with) a foreground notification?

The solution Google provides is Firebase Cloud Messaging which is the blessed notification service on the system which handles querrying notifications for all apps. FCM even avoids waking up the system from idle if the notification received is not high priority and can wait until sometime in the future when the device momentarily stops idling to processing everything at once before idling again. replybrookst 6 hours agoparentprevNot much point in engaging with someone who sees all opposing views as “apologists” “crawling out” reply pjmlp 2 hours agoparentprevThe hacker spirit in relation to Apple was long gone when the Mac Classic was released.People that imagine otherwise haven&#x27;t lived through those days. reply Brian_K_White 7 hours agoparentprevThere is a value to the iphone users, not just the android users, but neither Apple nor most iphone users will ever acknowledge that. reply wraptile 1 hour agoparentprevHN&#x27;s obsession with Apple feels like some twisted mix of Stockholm syndrome, american nationalism and sunk cost falacy.

The Epic Games Store isn&#x27;t even a complex ecosystem, it&#x27;s just a glorified Windows app downloader and even then they couldn&#x27;t make a profit at 12%.Apple argues that their 15% fee for most (30% for the ultra-successful) pays for a lot more than just payment services. It pays for absorbing the cost of fraud. It pays for dealing with refunds. It pays for developing the APIs. It pays for employing an enormous team to perform some imperfect-but-useful oversight over the 1,800,000 apps in their store. It pays for a lot of things.If you think Apple makes too much money, fine. That&#x27;s a perfectly fine argument to make.

People were being willfully blind about how this \"hack\" works.Using an exfiltrated binary they used its blackbox functions to perform a sort of device attestation using ripped Apple device identifiers.

These aren&#x27;t just RNGs they&#x27;re fabricating, they&#x27;re sets of legitimate Apple device data that isn&#x27;t plainly evident to any random user-mode app.Why would they block it? Every service has some sort of gate on who can message or it will be overrun by bad actors and spammers. Signal, Telegram and others make you validate your cell phone number -- there&#x27;s a finite number of those, and they can blacklist them as necessary.

In fact the only blue bubbles I receive are spam. reply meindnoch 7 hours agorootparentnext [2 more] [flagged] rezonant 7 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t a useful comment, you&#x27;re just assuming your experience is valid and others who disagree aren&#x27;t, and using it to sling accusations of dishonesty.If spam is really the problem Apple is worried about, then isn&#x27;t it conceivable that it happens and that Apple has to work to keep spam low so you have a good experience? Such work is ongoing and sometimes spam gets through anyway.

Also not sure why I’m downvoted. I occasionally receive spam messages from iMessage users, not conventional SMS. I do not know how these spammers manage to send them, but the senders are always identified with an email in the app, that’s how I could tell it apart from conventional SMS. reply skygazer 3 hours agorootparentI guess (based on the skeptical reactions) your experience is atypical now-a-days, but based on your comment, I did find a 2014 wired article saying that while previously unheard of, iMessage now [then] accounted for 30% of spam, from email addresses like you described. I had no idea. Somehow I avoided that. I didn’t find anything more recent, though, so maybe it’s less of a problem now?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;apples-imessage-is-being-taken...I do know first hand that Apple will turn off (starting at several days) an Apple user’s ability to use iMessage if they get even several reports, though. reply rezonant 7 hours agorootparentprevThe GP is using a euphemism popular in the US. Indeed, the sent messages are colored not the received ones, but the euphemism labels the cause of the color, not the person receiving the text. If you are not from the US I&#x27;m sure this is weird. reply rafabulsing 7 hours agorootparentprevWait, what? Android user here so I might just be confused, but my impression always was that it&#x27;s the received messages that are different, hence the whole blue&#x2F;green bubble debacle, and Android users being bullied for having green bubble texts. reply rezonant 7 hours agorootparentSee my sibling comment for an explanation. replyoefnak 3 hours agorootparentprevThe EU will soon require interoperability between messaging apps!

So large companies have to proactively share information on all their users with all the other large companies, and vice versa? Or do I become skygazer@iMessage and everyone on instagram has to know that? This just seems like an absurd thing to mandate. reply bradleybuda 8 hours agorootparentprevAlso WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Telegram, LINE, and a handful of others with more than a half-billion users. Are those heptopolists or septopolists?The word \"monopolist\" in 2023 seems to mean \"a company whose corporate values are different than my personal ones and&#x2F;or whose pricing and packaging don&#x27;t match my consumption function and&#x2F;or who has a lot of money and of whom I am jealous\". reply rezonant 8 hours agorootparentI think you might be mistaking what monopoly&#x2F;duopoly is being mentioned here. Those companies aren&#x27;t phone manufacturers and they don&#x27;t make phone texting apps. The distinction might not matter to you, but it&#x27;s clearly the meaning of the GP.You can say iMessage isn&#x27;t a texting app because iMessage functionally (as in, the technical details) works like a non-texting app, but it is the only texting app on those phones and is the way normal texting is done. Perhaps it would be different if iMessage was just installable from the app store. reply eek2121 7 hours agorootparentYou are aware that iPhones have many alternative messaging apps right? The second part of your comment is simply not true. reply empyrrhicist 6 hours agorootparentYet you cannot set a new default messaging app... reply dwaite 4 hours agorootparentDo you mean a default \"carrier SMS service\" app?In everyday iPhone usage, you would either run an app directly, use sharing intents, or use a messaging service specific identifier (eg custom URI scheme) to converse with someone. The social graph is either in the messaging app itself or in individual contact entries. There&#x27;s no expectation of a Trillian&#x2F;Adium style app that consolidates all information and messaging options. reply rezonant 3 hours agorootparentThe confusion is that there is only one texting app on iPhone. Chat apps are done \"over the top\" and can be whatever you want. You or I can make one. There is only one texting app on iOS and most users in the US only use their phone&#x27;s texting app. This is why Apple&#x27;s iMessage is genius, insidious, and diabolical- because they took SMS which had universal adoption in the US and had it invisibly and transparently extended into a component of their walled garden. They didn&#x27;t need to convince everyone to move from SMS to their own messaging app, because if you used SMS on an iPhone, iMessage just happened. reply mlindner 5 hours agorootparentprev\"Default messaging app\" is a creation of Android, necessitated because every cell phone manufacturer wanted its own messaging app. It somehow later became a feature people needed because those pre-installed apps were often dreadful adware junk. This was never a problem on iPhones. No one wants to set a \"default messaging app\". It mixes up where messages go. I want my Signal messages in the Signal app. I want my LINE messages in the LINE app. Putting them in random different places doesn&#x27;t make sense and confuses where they&#x27;re coming from. I don&#x27;t want my contacts showing up half a dozen times repeatedly for every messaging app they&#x27;re using.I don&#x27;t see anyone on Android wanting to put their SMS messages in the Discord app. reply seabrookmx 3 hours agorootparentWeird take. Default apps for certain file types and links (email, video, etc) are a precedent across multiple operatings systems.> No one wantsQuite the assumption. I had Google Hangouts set as my default SMS app for a time.. this seems quite similar to your Discord example?It hurts nobody to have the _choice_. If you don&#x27;t want to change the default that&#x27;s totally OK. reply rezonant 3 hours agorootparentprevOn Android there is no such thing as a default messaging app. There is such a thing as a default SMS app, but my point is that messaging and texting represent two different things (texting is a subset of messaging) which has an extremely material impact on the dynamics of what is happening in the US, and why iMessage, RCS, and interoperability is a very big deal to users who use a texting app. reply rezonant 6 hours agorootparentprevTexting is a feature of a phone. You cannot, without elaborate workarounds, text from a consumer computer, tablet or other device as if it was a phone. Texting requires a phone number and a phone plan.I understand that the distinction might seem slight, but in the eyes of most US consumers, texting is distinct from a chat app that you download from an app store even if it uses your phone number.The absolute one way that everyone with a phone has to send a textual message to another person is to text them with their phone number.In the US, where adoption of Signal, Whatsapp, Discord, or insert hundreds of other apps is very small, the percentage of your real world contacts using a particular app is also extremely small. Convincing all of them to use Signal would certainly be great, but in reality you will be using all of those apps if you are trying to escape the interoperability nightmare that is currently texting.Given that everyone has a phone and they are all texting already, it would be awfully nice if we could just use texting without these interoperability problems without having to manage all of the apps, and without having to remember who prefers which one.Group texting is also hugely popular in the US. If no single third party messaging app covers the set of friends you want to group text, what do you do? You text them. Because everyone has it. Let&#x27;s say when you started your group everyone was on Whatsapp. Phenomenal! Start the group on Whatsapp. Then you meet Joe, and Joe is very cool and you definitely want him in the group chat. Joe doesn&#x27;t trust Meta products and doesn&#x27;t want to use Whatsapp. Should Joe capitulate, install another chat app used only for a single group chat, and grant access to their device to a Meta app? Should a negotiation occur amongst the rest of the group where they select a new common app to run the group on and split the conversation history, while also adding an app that they only use for that group chat?Let&#x27;s say they choose to switch to Signal, but Josh keeps forgetting (dammit Josh) and keeps messaging the group on Whatsapp. And instead of yell at Josh that the group is on Signal now, folks reply! Because Josh&#x27;s joke was super funny. Conversation als",

Jack Poulson and Lee Fang Dec 8, 2023 38 Share this post Inside the Pro-Israel Information War jackpoulson.substack.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 1 Share Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, speaks to J-Ventures investment fund on Oct. 10, 2023 about the security situation in Israel and how American supporters of Israel can assist with lobbying and public relations. As the Israel-Hamas war began to heat up in late October, Courtney Carey, a Dublin-based employee of the Israeli website building company Wix, posted the Irish words “SAOIRSE DON PHALAISTIN” -- “Freedom for Palestine” -- on her LinkedIn page. Within 24 hours of Carey’s LinkedIn post appearing, Alon Ozer, a Miami-based investor, took a screenshot of the post and shared it with a WhatsApp group of more than 300 like-minded investors, tech executives, activists, and at least one senior Israeli government official. Ozer took care to note that Carey worked for Wix. Oded Hermoni, a tech journalist-turned-venture capitalist, piped up to assure everyone that Batsheva Moshe, Wix’s general manager for Israel and a member of the group chat, had been “on it since Sat[urday] night.” Moshe then chimed in to assure her peers that the issue with Carey had been “taken care of since it was published.” “I believe there will be an announcement soon re our reaction,” she added. Wix terminated Carey the following day. Moshe was apparently aware of Carey’s LinkedIn comments, which also included a denunciation of the “Zionist ideology which promotes an exclusivist state,” before Ozer flagged them in the WhatsApp group. The interaction nonetheless reflects the heightened coordination among pro-Israel forces in Silicon Valley and the global tech sector. Following Hamas’ terror attack on Oct. 7, a loose network of pro-Israel investors, tech executives, activists, and Israeli government officials have stepped up their efforts to combat the slightest deviations from the pro-Israel script. The WhatsApp group where Carey’s case came up serves as a kind of switchboard where the various independent players in Silicon Valley’s pro-Israel community swap ideas, identify enemies, and collaborate on ways to defend Israel in the media, academia, and the business world. We have obtained access to thousands of the group’s WhatsApp messages dating back to mid-October, and an intricate spreadsheet where group participants request and claim tasks ranging from social media responses to IDF support shipments. Separately, we have viewed a number of video meetings charting best practices for “hasbara” –-- an Israeli term of art for “public diplomacy” whose detractors see it as a euphemism for propaganda -- that offer a window into Israel’s public-relations war that is not limited to the tech sector.

Download In addition to Moshe, the WhatsApp group includes prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Jeff Epstein – a former CFO of Oracle – and Andy David, a diplomat-cum-venture capitalist who also serves as the Israeli foreign ministry’s head of innovation, entrepreneurship, and tech. The WhatsApp group, officially named the “J-Ventures Global Kibbutz Group,” is a project of J-Ventures, a U.S.-Israeli investment fund that calls itself a “capitalist kibbutz” -- a reference to Israel’s historically collectivist farming communities. Hermoni, the WhatsApp group’s founder, is a managing director of J-Ventures, and David, the foreign ministry official, is internally listed by J-Ventures as a member of the \"PR/Political Team\" that makes decisions on messaging and lobbying. The WhatsApp group, spreadsheet, and various video discussions offer a rare public glimpse of how Israel and its American allies harness Israel’s influential tech sector and tech diaspora to run cover for the Jewish state as it endures scrutiny over the humanitarian impact of its invasion of Gaza. Conversations of this kind are not unusual for any important interest group, but they reveal the degree to which, in the tech-oriented hasbara world, the lines between government, the private sector, and the nonprofit world are blurry at best. And the tactics that these wealthy individuals, advocates, and groups use -- hounding Israel critics on social media; firing pro-Palestine employees and canceling speaking engagements; smearing Palestinian journalists; and attempting to ship military-grade equipment to the IDF -- are often heavy-handed and controversial. “This is a peek under the hood of how U.S. foreign policy is steered in order to produce policy outcomes,” said Eli Clifton, a senior advisor to the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. Clifton noted that the White House has strongly communicated an interest in limiting civilian casualties during the war, but appears unable to muster the political resources to change the IDF’s current direction. \"President Biden seems incapable of using the one policy tool that may actually produce a change in Israel's actions that might limit civilian deaths, which would be to condition military aid that the United States provides to Israel,” Clifton added. He partially attributed the inability of the U.S. government to rein in Israel’s war actions to the “lobbying and advocacy efforts underway.” Two contiguous screenshots from a Sunday, Oct. 22 conversation in the J-Ventures WhatsApp group regarding the firing of Dublin-based Wix employee Courtney Carey for her pro-Palestinian LinkedIn statements. The last participant is Wix’s General Manager for Israel, Batsheve Moshe, using a kind of Hebrew rebus handle. ‘Maintaining Pressure,’ At the Behest of the IDF Just days after the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel from Hamas, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesperson for Israel Defense Forces, beamed into a Zoom meeting to brief pro-Israel activists from Silicon Valley. The participants included major venture capitalists and technology executives, such as Jordan Blashek, the President of America’s Frontier Fund, a national security investment firm backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. \"There is still fighting ongoing in sporadic clashes and attacks by Hamas terrorists in southern Israel,\" Conricus said. Since he was speaking to the group on an unencrypted, open line, Conricus cautioned that he could not divulge too many secrets. But, he added, the war would soon escalate with an Israeli military response and the participants on the call could lend a hand. The IDF spokesman encouraged those on the call to assist with “maintaining pressure on legislators” in Congress and to work to influence those “in universities or media, or think tanks, or in elite circles.” Members of the hasbara-oriented tech world WhatsApp group have eagerly taken up the call to shape public opinion as part of a bid to win what’s been described as the “second battlefield” and “the information war.” It’s not hard to see why. On Oct. 7, Hamas murdered an estimated 1,200 Israelis and foreign workers, and abducted roughly 240 people as hostages. The killing spree was the worst mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust and a tragedy that immediately upended Israeli society. The massacre also prompted Israel to embark on an invasion of Gaza that has killed more than 16,000 Palestinians, most of whom are women and children and displaced more than 1 million Gaza residents from their homes. Critics of the invasion argue that Israel is both failing to minimize the invasion’s impact on Palestinian civilians and to recognize that it will only achieve security when Palestinians have hope for a state of their own. But Israel maintains that it must stop at nothing to eradicate Hamas, which embeds itself in civilian infrastructure. That’s where the efforts of J-Ventures’ hasbara WhatsApp group come in. The group, which also includes attorneys and individuals affiliated with the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), has tirelessly worked to fire employees and punish activists for expressing pro-Palestinian views. It has also engaged in a successful push to cancel events held by prominent Palestinian voices, including an Arizona State University talk featuring Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat who is the only Palestinian-American in Congress. The group has also circulated a push-poll suggesting Rep. Tlaib should resign from office and provided an automated means of thanking Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) for voting to censure her. In some cases, officials from the IDF and other parts of the Israeli government have joined the effort. David, the Israeli foreign ministry official and an investor in J-Ventures, has shared official talking points in the WhatsApp group. One presentation that David shared made the case that Hamas intentionally stations its military operations near civilian sites as part of its strategy of deploying “human shields.” United Nations officials have discovered Hamas rockets hidden in a vacant school in the past, and indeed, the militant group's vast, underground tunnel network endangers civilians throughout the Gaza Strip. Yet the recent IDF document uses broad categories to identify Hamas military sites and Israeli targets, including a “Hamas bank” located next to a Palestinian kindergarten. An IDF presentation shared by Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs official and J-Ventures investor Andy David and dated Oct. 11. Israeli officials have invested heavily in shaping the narrative about its war on social media, viewing online discourse as a vital area for maintaining public support. Last month, a spokeswoman for the IDF and the Israel office director of Bessemer Venture Partners, the venture capital firm where Jeff Epstein is an operating partner, jointly led a Zoom workshop for “high-tech leaders” on tactics for scoring “victories” in the public discourse on Twitter/X. J-Ventures has also raised funds for automated technology to mass report tweets and for facial recognition technology for the IDF to identify hostages. Meanwhile, other Israeli officials have led similar webinar sessions on strategy to shape coverage in campus newspapers and major media outlets. J-Ventures has joined the broader U.S. Jewish community in supporting more conventional charity efforts in Israel. One J-Ventures impact report notes that the group raised money for laptops for Israeli children evacuated because of the conflict and supplied mental health services for those traumatized by the Oct. 7 attack. The chats discuss the urgent need to send medical supplies and funds to Israeli hospitals. Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old Israeli-American IDF soldier who went missing on Oct. 7 and is believed to be a hostage of Hamas, is also a member of WhatsApp chat. The group has coordinated closely with Chen to promote his television appearances. But J-Ventures has also veered into an unusual kind of philanthropy: shipments of military supplies. The group has attempted to provide tactical gear to Israel’s equivalent of the U.S. Navy SEALs, known as Shayetet-13, and donated to a foundation dedicated to supporting the IDF’s undercover “Duvdevan” unit, which is known for infiltrating Palestinian populations. Many of the shipments intended for the IDF were held up at U.S. airports over customs issues. ‘Ridicule Works’: The Social Media War The online space has been a focal point of pro-Israel activism, far beyond J-Ventures. Less than two weeks into the conflict, the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry released 75 different online ads and spent millions of dollars purchasing space on platforms such as YouTube and Twitter/X. The ministry, which operates several highly active social media accounts, has also reached out directly to American allies, helping guide pro-Israel activism on social platforms. \"You guys are our frontline soldiers,” said Tamar Schwarzbard, head of Digital Diplomacy at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, on an October Zoom call posted online by Hasbara Fellowships, a nonprofit group that works closely with the Israeli government to train pro-Israel activists in the U.S. and Canada. She noted that the government needed help reframing the Gaza war and the public messaging over the conflict with Hamas. “Let’s say you see some kind of newspaper article on your campus news site showing support or solidarity with the Palestinians and not speaking out against what's going on in the Gaza envelope and in Israel,” she said. “So you want to make sure, try to tag, let's say, the president of the university on the post you're putting out condemning that article.” “Hamas does really good PR,” continued Schwarzbard. “We need to change the narrative.” She implored the group to use focused language. “We need people to see this isn't just a run-of-the-mill resistance, freedom fighter group. This is something equivalent of ISIS.” Schwarzbard instructed participants on the call to use certain hashtags when discussing the conflict, such as #HamasIsISIS, #IStandwithIsrael, and #IsraelUnderAttack. The strategy would boost engagement and bring a large audience to the pro-Israel cause, she explained. She also focused on the expected public relations challenges posed by the war. Israel would soon lose international support as its military response in Gaza kills more Palestinian civilians, noted Schwarzbad, who stressed the need to refocus attention on Israeli civilian deaths. “Try to use names and ages whenever you can,” she said. Don’t refer to statistics of the dead, use stories. “Say something like, 'Noah, age 26, was celebrating with her friends at a music festival on the holiest day of the week, Shabbat. Imagine if your daughter was at Coachella.’” As with the efforts to punish employees and activists, senior figures in both Silicon Valley and the Israeli tech corridor work closely with the Israeli government to disseminate pro-Israel narratives on social media. On Nov. 22, Adam Fisher, the head of the Israel office of Bessemer Venture Partners, gave a presentation on how U.S. “high-tech leaders, investors, and entrepreneurs,” such as himself, could help the Israel Defense Forces win the “information war” on social media. IDF spokesperson Major Libby Weiss, who previously worked as the head of the IDF’s international social media and as the official spokesperson to American and Canadian journalists, presented in military uniform to the group just moments before Fisher. Throughout numerous presentation slides filled with screenshots of his own tweets – frequently with the number of likes and retweets circled in red – Fisher gave examples of his strategies for “criticizing and ridiculing” prominent Twitter/X users who were sympathetic to Palestinians. On a slide entitled, “Ridicule works,” Fisher’s “ridicule” examples ranged from Rep. Rashida Tlaib, to Palestinian-American policy analyst Mariam Barghouti and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Paul Graham. Fisher also claimed credit for online criticism leading to the resignation of Paddy Cosgrave as CEO of the technology conference Web Summit. Slides from a Nov. 22 presentation given by Adam Fisher, the Israel country manager of Bessemer Venture Partners, which explained to “high tech leaders” and an in-uniform spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces how he effectively “ridicules” pro-Palestinian influencers on Twitter/X, including Palestinian-American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and venture capitalist Paul Graham. But Fisher also emphasized the importance of an occasional soft touch on social media that is appropriate for defusing more mild critics and harnessing potential allies. The venture capitalist offered broad rhetorical strategies for pro-Israel voices to engage on social media, identifying three types of people worth cultivating online. The first group is what he dubbed “the impressionables,” who are \"typically young people, they reflexively support the weak, oppose the oppressor,\" but \"are not really knowledgeable.\" For this category of people, the goal is not to \"convince them of anything,\" but to \"show them that it's much more complicated than it seems.\" Seeding doubt, he said, would make certain audiences think twice before attending a protest. \"So it's really about creating some kind of confusion,” Fisher continued, “but really, just to make it clear to them that it's really a lot more complicated.\" A second category, Fisher explained, is the \"uncomfortable sympathizer,\" a group that \"wants to support Israel -- they're typically more liberal,\" but opposes the current government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. These types can be won over, Fisher said, by pointing out \"that we are a multi-ethnic, diverse, democratic liberal society with rotten apples.\" The final group consists of those who are \"reflexively pro-Israel, kind of ‘Israel, right or wrong.’\" Members of this group \"are not actually very knowledgeable,\" so they needed to be equipped with the right facts to make them \"more effective in advocating for Israel,” Fisher said. Fisher repeatedly noted the need to offer accurate and nuanced information to rebut critics of Israel's actions. Yet at times, he offered his own misinformation, such as his claim that \"anti-Israel\" human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch \"didn't condemn the October 7th massacre.\" In fact, Amnesty had condemned Hamas’ attack a few days after it occurred, detailing a long list of atrocities committed by the Palestinian militia and allied groups. “Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups flagrantly violated international law and displayed a chilling disregard for human life,” Amnesty stated in its Oct. 12 report. Similarly, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a dispatch on Oct. 10 that condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, noting that deliberately \"killing civilians is a war crime, as is hostage taking.\" The efforts to discredit HRW stem directly from its outspoken criticism of Israel’s record in the occupied territories and its military conduct. An HRW report released the same day as Fisher’s remarks cited the World Health Organization’s conclusion that the IDF had killed roughly one child in Gaza every 10 minutes since the outbreak of violence in October. Other efforts to defend Israel coming from Silicon Valley involve technological attempts to censor critics and promote a pro-Israel message to shape opinions about the war. Gadi Hutt, senior director of business development at Amazon-owned subsidiary Annapurna Labs, has helped the J-Ventures team pressure the Amazon online marketplace to remove t-shirts and other merchandise that feature the slogan, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” – a campaign that was ultimately successful, he announced to the WhatsApp group. Hutt also informed the WhatsApp group that he was leading “a group of technologists to implement multiple projects aiding the war effort.” One of the J-Ventures documents lists Hutt as the point person for Canary Mission, a controversial group that blacklists pro-Palestinian figures on college campuses, to help the group train \"AI models to classify antisemitic posts from Twitter.” Earlier this week, members of the J-Ventures group chat also internally circulated a petition for Netflix to remove the award-winning Jordanian film ‘Farha,’ claiming that its portrayal of the actions of IDF soldiers during the 1948 displacement of Palestinians constituted “blood libel,” while another said the film was based “antisemitism and lies.” Last year, the Israeli government revoked funding for a theater in Jaffa for screening the film, while government figures called for other repercussions to Netflix for streaming it. In the WhatsApp group, demand faced some pushback. One member noted that despite the controversy over a scene in the film in which Israeli soldiers execute a Palestinian family, Israeli historians have documented that “such actions have indeed happened.” The critique was rejected by other members of the group, who said the film constituted “incitement” against Jews. J-Ventures documents and affiliated WhatsApp discussions also show support for a variety of automated attempts to remove pro-Palestinian content on social media. In one instance, J-Ventures donated $19,531 to DigitalDome.io, an initiative that promotes itself as an online version of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, promising that “offensive and malicious content is intercepted here.” Hermoni and Rami Lipman, an investor in Israel, are listed as the points of contact for the contribution. An Oct. 25 posting in the J-Ventures WhatsApp channel asserted that DigitalDome’s “recent achievements” included the censorship of Hamas’ channels on the Telegram communications platform using Android phones, allegedly as a result of Telegram being forced to comply with Google Play’s guidelines. DigitalDome likewise touts various efforts to remove pro-Palestinian content from Instagram and Twitter/X. In one case, the site claims it had successfully reported an account to a European Union legal body for posting videos with Hamas fighters. The little-known DigitalDome.io website is labeled by J-Ventures as part of its hasbara, or pro-Israel public relations efforts, and is run in partnership with the Israeli fact-checking website FakeReporter, which was founded by Achiya Schatz, a veteran of the IDF’s undercover commando unit, Duvdevan. Schatz has had a curious career trajectory, however; prior to founding FakeReporter, he served as communications director for the left-wing Israeli group Breaking the Silence. Breaking the Silence documents the stories of IDF veterans who feel guilty about what they see as immoral practices in which they were complicit during their military service, and now advocate for peaceful resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict. When reached for comment, Schatz stated that he started FakeReporter out of a genuine concern about the impact of misinformation on the public discourse. The nonprofit group is \"devoted to fact-based conversation, anti-hate speech, anti-violence … because I believe that the democratic space has shrunk to a place that conversation almost doesn't even matter anymore,\" he said. Schatz vehemently denied the suggestion that his group is part of the hasbara ecosystem or otherwise aims to help Israel shape its public image. “Maybe people … think I'm doing it for different [reasons], or even to fight pro-Palestinian activists,” he said. “I do not.” In the WhatsApp group, J-Ventures also promoted IronTruthBot, a bot that automates the process of removing “inflammatory, false, and defamatory posts against Israel from all platforms.” The project was described as being developed by a group of volunteers, receiving 700 reports a day and succeeding in removing “hundreds of inappropriate posts.” A ‘Safe and Inclusive Environment’ -- Free of Dissenting Voices Over the last two months, dozens of individuals have been fired for expressing opinions related to the war in Gaza and Israel. Most have been dismissed for expressing pro-Palestinian views, including a writer for PhillyVoice, the editor of ArtForum, an apprentice at German publishing giant Axel Springer, and Michael Eisen, the editor-in-chief of eLife, a prominent science journal. Eisen’s offense was a tweet sharing a satirical article from The Onion seen as sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. The WhatsApp chats provide a rare look at the organizing efforts behind the broad push to fire critics of Israel and suppress public events featuring critics of the Israeli government. The scope is surprisingly broad, ranging from investigating the funding sources of student organizations such as Model Arab League, to monitoring an organizing toolkit of a Palestine Solidarity Working Group – “They are verrrry well organized”, one member exclaimed – to working directly with high-level tech executives to fire pro-Palestinian employees. Sometimes it is unclear whether the group’s members actually have elite IDF and Israeli government connections, or are merely engaging in idle bluster. Saar Gillai, chair of Liquid Instruments and board member to several other tech companies, said he had passed the Palestinian solidarity organizing document \"to 'friends' in places s tarting [sic] with 8....,\" an apparent reference to Israeli military intelligence Unit 8200. Unit 8200 is both a massive communications interception operation -- Israel’s rough equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency -- and an elite intelligence analysis and cybersecurity unit that has become a springboard for Israel’s booming tech startup sector. Gillai served in the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate, the parent organization of Unit 8200, from 1985 to 1992, according to his LinkedIn page. Batsheva Moshe, the Wix executive who organized the firing of Ms. Carey, moderated the Zoom call with Fisher and Major Weiss, and promoted the event within the WhatsApp group run by Mr. Hermoni, the managing partner of J-Ventures. Ms. Moshe did not respond to a request for comment. The organized firing of Carey was one many attempts by tech executives and other participants in the WhatsApp logs to penalize pro-Palestinian speech. J-Ventures similarly mobilized efforts among its team to place pressure on several university campuses against student-led events. On Oct. 16, a WhatsApp member Daniel A. Bock, an Arizona-based technology lawyer, forwarded a message calling attention to Rep. Tlaib’s scheduled appearance at Arizona State University for an event with Arizona Palestine Network, a pro-Palestine advocacy group. \"Let’s call ASU and get this thing cancelled [sic]. Can we do this in one day?” Bock wrote, alongside contact information for ASU officials and the Scottsdale, Ariz. mayor's office. Several members chimed in with approval for the effort. One participant even suggested that they appeal to the university’s “woke” aversion to exposing students to uncomfortable ideas. The participant drafted a sample letter claiming that Tlaib’s appearance threatened ASU’s “commitment to a safe and inclusive environment.” The following day, ASU officially canceled the Tlaib event, citing “procedural issues.” The WhatsApp group shared the news and celebrated the decision. The WhatsApp group mustered similar efforts against pro-Palestinian activists and writers. Lior Netzer, a business consultant based in Massachusetts, and a member of the J-Ventures WhatsApp group, requested help pressuring the University of Vermont to cancel a lecture with Mohammed El-Kurd, a Palestinian writer for The Nation magazine. Netzer shared a sample script that alleged that El-Kurd had engaged in anti-Semitic speech in the past. The effort also appeared to be successful. Shortly after the letter-writing campaign, UVM canceled the talk, citing safety concerns. The pro-Israel organizing efforts to silence pro-Palestinian speech raises concerns with some observers of the conflict. “You can disagree with critics of Israel, you can oppose what they're saying,” noted the Quincy Institute’s Clifton. “But this is an effort to constrain the debate in an underhanded manner.” The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a civil libertarian group that has long defended controversial speech on campus, likewise expressed its disapproval. “FIRE is deeply concerned by cancellations of speaking events and retaliation against individuals for their speech about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Aaron Terr, FIRE’s director of public advocacy, said in a statement. “This censorship raises First Amendment issues when perpetrated by government actors like state colleges.” “In times like these, with political tensions running high, it’s especially important that colleges and other institutions whose very purpose is to foster free expression facilitate dialogue instead of shutting it down,” Terr added. The WhatsApp group maintained a special focus on elite universities and white-collar professional positions. Group members not only circulated multiple petitions to fire professors and blacklist students from working at major law firms for allegedly engaging in extremist rhetoric, but a J-Ventures spreadsheet lists specific task force teams to \"get professors removed who teach falcehoods [sic] to their students.\" The list includes academics at Cornell University, the University of California, Davis, and NYU’s Abu Dhabi campus, among others. Many of the messages in the group focused on ways in which to shape student life at Stanford University, including support for pro-Israel activists. The attempted interventions into campus life at times hinged on the absurd. Shortly after comedian Amy Schumer posted a now-deleted satirical cartoon lampooning pro-Palestinian protesters as supporters of rape and beheadings, Epstein, the operating partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and member of the J-Ventures WhatsApp group, asked, \"How can we get this political cartoon published in the Stanford Daily?\" Though Epstein noted, “I don’t know who created it or owns the copyright.” On Saturday, Oct. 28, Jeff Epstein, an operating partner at Bessemer Venture Partners who was previously the Chief Financial Officer of Oracle and Google’s DoubleClick, asked the more than 300 member WhatsApp group of the J-Ventures “capitalist kibbutz” how the group can get the student newspaper of Stanford University to publish an anti-Palestinian political cartoon. Neither Adam Fisher nor Jeff Epstein responded to requests for comment. Rubbing Elbows with Lawmakers The powerful roster of J-Ventures' team helped the group reach a far-flung audience. In the midst of its pro-Israel advocacy, the firm’s leadership reminded the WhatsApp group of their high-profile ties. The investment fund touted the fact that two of its portfolio companies were the only two start-ups to be included in the APEC CEO Summit in San Francisco with President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The CEO of one of these two start-ups, Adam Tartakovsky of Epic Cleantec, was also widely described as the primary lobbying connection between J-Ventures and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The influence extended beyond the business and tech world and into politics. The J-Ventures team includes advocates with the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying organization, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC. Officials in the J-Ventures group include investor David Wagonfeld, whose biography states he is “leading AIPAC Silicon Valley;” Tartakovsky, listed as “AIPAC Political Chair;” Adam Milstein, a real estate executive and major AIPAC donor; and AIPAC-affiliated activists Drs. Kathy Fields and Garry Rayant. Kenneth Baer, a former White House advisor to President Barack Obama and communications counsel to the Anti-Defamation League, is also an active member of the group. Members of the group who are involved with AIPAC helped advise other group members on how to approach Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) about a meeting. Although the lawmaker was initially scheduled to address the group over Zoom, J-Ventures repeatedly rescheduled, and ultimately canceled the event after members of the WhatsApp group objected to Khanna’s ties to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom Saar Gillai, chair of Liquid Instruments, called \"the ultimate anti Israel Jew.\" Despite the group meeting never taking place, as confirmed by Rep. Khanna, Hermoni shared a photo with the group on Nov. 6 of the two having lunch outside of an Italian restaurant in Los Altos, Calif. J-Ventures also had to cancel a planned Oct. 30 meeting with former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, the founder of a multimillion-dollar tech startup. The in-person meeting with Bennett had been scheduled long before the Oct. 7 terror attacks, after which Bennett was no longer available. Reached for comment, Rep. Khanna confirmed that he met with Hermoni, but that the scheduled J-Ventures Zoom call was canceled. The congressman noted that he enjoys broad support from the tech community. “Some have commented on my strong stance against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and appreciated that,” he said. “I’ve tried to bring people in my district together and foster civil dialogue.” A photo of U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) and J-Ventures managing partner Oded Hermoni sitting outside of The American Italian Delicatessen at 139 Main Street in Los Altos, Calif. Mr. Hermoni shared the picture with the J-Ventures WhatsApp group on November 6, 2023. The extensive donor network of J-Ventures also helped bankroll high-priced advocacy efforts. The group raised money for 84 billboards in Toronto, Canada, a digital billboard in Las Vegas, and, “in key locations such as Times Square in New York and all over London,” according to their planning documents. One of the biggest coups by the J-Ventures team was a successful effort to secure funding to air a special television advertisement on the Tonight Show, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN calling for the release of the hostages taken by Hamas. Other fundraising efforts from J-Ventures included an emergency fund to provide direct support for IDF units, including the naval commando unit Shayetet-13. The leaked planning document also uncovers attempts to supply the mostly female Caracal Battalion with grenade pouches and to donate M16 rifle scope mounts, “FN MAG” machine gun carrier vests, and drones to unnamed IDF units. According to the planning document, customs enforcement barriers have stranded many of the packages destined for the IDF in Montana and Colorado. We reached out to Hermoni with a detailed request for comment about J-Ventures and the WhatsApp group’s goals, including the military materiel shipments; the extent of Andy David’s involvement in the initiative; and what he sees as the group’s biggest accomplishments to date. Hermoni did not reply directly. Instead, the morning after being reached for comment, Hermoni warned the WhatsApp group against cooperating with our inquiries. “Two journalists … are trying to have an anti semi[tic] portrait of our activity to support israel and reaching out to members,” he wrote. “Please ignore them and do not cooperate.” he advised. Shortly thereafter, we were kicked out of the group. A screenshot of J-Ventures managing partner Oded Hermoni’s warning to the members of the firm’s network after he was reached for comment. Running Interference on the ‘Media Battlefield’ Several well-funded pro-Israel groups have led campaigns to pressure major media outlets to present friendly coverage of Israel over the course of the war in Gaza. The Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre, known as BICOM, a prominent NGO in the United Kingdom funded by Poju Zabludowicz, a real estate investor whose father founded a prominent Israeli weapons company, has launched several media-focused campaigns. One current effort features a letter-writing campaign to UK lawmakers, demanding that they rein in coverage of the conflict by the BBC. An automated form letter provided by the group denounces the BBC for, among other things, employing a journalist who \"writes of casualties in Gaza\" and blames \"Western media for being complicit in Israel's attack.\" Another BICOM campaign encourages residents of the UK to write to Ofcom, the media regulator, to complain of anti-Israel bias in British media. The J-Ventures group pooled efforts to guide reporters from ABC News and other major stations. In its list of action items, the group noted that “NPR is looking for personal stories of how the ‘Mideast crisis’ is affecting people in the US” and called for assistance with locating college students to respond. And at times, the boundaries between journalism and advocacy have significantly blurred since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. One notable group is HonestReporting, a nonprofit that describes itself as a journalism watchdog devoted to \"truth, integrity and fairness, and to combat ideological prejudice in journalism and the media, as it impacts Israel.\" The website for the organization touts its \"objectivity\" and educational resources designed to filter out what it sees as anti-Israel media bias. HonestReporting produced a report in November alleging that Palestinian photojournalists who captured pictures of Hamas fighters during the Oct. 7 attack had coordinated with the terror group, making the journalists legitimate targets for the IDF. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s office agreed, writing on X, “These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics.” And Danny Danon, an Israeli cabinet minister, promised on X to “hunt them down together with the terrorists.” HonestReporting drew some blood. CNN and AP cut ties with Gaza-based freelance photographer Hasan Eslaiah after HonestReporting released its report, and later, posted a photo of Eslaiah getting a kiss from Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza. But the advocacy group’s “just asking questions”-style report mostly backfired. Reuters, AP, the New York Times, and CNN denied any prior knowledge of Eslaiah or other freelancers coordinating with Hamas. Some of the outlets went further, condemning HonestReporting’s work for jeopardizing the safety of freelance journalists working in a war zone. The New York Times, for example, said in a statement, “We are gravely concerned that unsupported accusations and threats to freelancers endangers them and undermines work that serves the public interest.” HonestReporting ended up on the defensive. Rather than apologize though, the lead author of the report, Gil Hoffman, a former Jerusalem Post reporter who is now executive director of HonestReporting, deflected criticism by asserting that his organization had “raised questions” without providing definitive answers. Hoffman told Reuters that he accepted the news organizations’ denials and was “so relieved” to hear them. He also condemned Israeli government officials for what he saw as taking liberties with the report. When speaking to an audience of fellow hasbara warriors though, Hoffman was more celebratory, touting the report as an unadulterated success. In a Nov. 15 talk he gave to the Hasbara Fellowships as part of its leadership briefing series, Hoffman explained that his exposé “attracted attention all around the world” and made “the world remember October 7, which they had forgotten.” The release of the HonestReporting report suggesting that Palestinian journalists are actually Hamas operatives, Hoffman continued, shifted attention away from the IDF war in Gaza and cast doubt on the reliability of reports from inside Gaza. “You can’t trust the journalists that come out of Gaza,” Hoffman argued. “They could have saved lives and instead took pictures that highlighted the achievements of Hamas.” Speaking to the Hasbara Fellowships audience, Hoffman also characterized himself as a foot soldier in a wider war on behalf of Israel, rather than a media watchdog primarily concerned with combating bias, as its website suggests. “There are three battles going on right now for Israel’s existence,” he said. Those battles, he explained, take place on the military battlefield, on college campuses, and the one in which HonestReporting engages, “the media battlefield.” Victory on the “media battlefield,” Hoffman concluded, “eases pressure on IDF to go quicker, to wrap up” and “goes a long way to deciding how much time Israel has to complete an operation.” Subscribe 38 Share this post Inside the Pro-Israel Information War jackpoulson.substack.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 1 Share A guest post by Lee Fang Investigative reporter Subscribe to Lee",

Accurate and unbiased information about what is happening in Gaza is somewhat hard to find while Israel has a lot of reliable information supporting anything they want. The information that does come out from Gaza spreads farther, unfortunately a lot of which is wrong because people spread unreliable sources, but information from Israel supporting their positions is greater and more accurate because they have more media resources. reply A1kmm 11 hours agoparentprevI think the fundamental assumption of the analysis that there are two mutually exclusive groups, &#x27;pro-Israel&#x27; and &#x27;pro-Palestine&#x27; is flawed. It is possible to simultaneously support the interests of Palestinian and Israeli civilians (and support a peaceful Israel within the 1967 boundaries), while condemning the massacre of civilians under the orders of Likud (and other far right parties) and Hamas.I think it is currently about an order of magnitude more civilians deaths have resulted from the actions of Likud (Netanyahu etc..., who control the government and hence the IDF) than from the actions of Hamas. IDF is apparently disrupting civilian aid, destroying infrastructure including hospitals, and causing mass population movements into areas that cannot support them, so the risk of death from starvation and infectious disease at a massive scale as an indirect result is high. The Likud-controlled IDF are also apparently enforcing a &#x27;lock down&#x27; of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank while allowing Israeli citizens to seize land by force and further expand the occupied territories.So the scale of the atrocities seems to be much higher on the Likud side than the Hamas side, covers both the West Bank and Gaza, and it makes sense that the Palestinian victims of those atrocities would receive more support. That doesn&#x27;t mean that all the people who care about the plight of the Palestinian population are anti-Israel (they are just not posting about it because they are likely prioritising issues). reply The_Colonel 10 hours agorootparentI think that forcing this dichotomy is part of the deliberate pro-Israel media strategy - if you despise Hamas inhumane acts, then of course you need to be pro-Israel. They want you to focus on Hamas to steer away your attention from what Israel has been doing. (this is also one of the reasons why Hamas has historically been an asset for the Israeli right) reply YZF 8 hours agorootparentHamas has been an assset for the Israeli right because it helps prevent a two state solution. The goal is really to weaken the Palestinian Authority. In recent years most of Hamas&#x27; crimes were against Palestinians and nobody cared. Forcing this dichotomy today is certainly a strategy but I don&#x27;t think that was really a strategy pre-Oct 7th. I.e. I don&#x27;t recall ever Israel trying to justify settler violence against Palestinians in the west bank as being a response to Hamas- wouldn&#x27;t make any sense.In some perverse way, the objection to the two state solution forces the one state solution, which is likely the only solution that would ever work. Jews and Arabs living side by side in the same country as equal citizens. Hamas isn&#x27;t interested in that solution either. reply zozbot234 8 hours agorootparent> Jews and Arabs living side by side in the same country as equal citizens.Except that Israel has Arabs already, living side by side with the Jews there. Palestinians have rejected that. reply YZF 8 hours agorootparentYes yes. I&#x27;m from Israel. I know that story.Palestinians did not reject a one state solution. Most Israelis don&#x27;t want that. I.e. annex the West Bank and Gaza and have a single country, let&#x27;s call it \"Israel-Palestine\".I think the Israeli Arabs are a model&#x2F;proof that it can work. It might need a generation or two to get there.If you want more radical ideas then if all Palestinian Arabs convert to Judaism we can also solve the problem pretty quickly... reply TeaBrain 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see how the minority of Israeli Arabs can so easily be used as proof. The Arab population of Israel is around 20% at 2 million. The population of the two Palestinian territories is at around 5 million Arabs and they have a strong Muslim majority. Israel&#x27;s population is considered to be 3&#x2F;4 Jewish. If Israel and the Palestinian territories were to become combined into a single state, it would no longer have a strong Jewish majority and would also cease to have its strong secular minority. It would cease to be Israel.Even though the current Israeli government may be more conservative than the ones previous, I see few possibilities for a more socially liberal government if Israel were to combine with the more-conservative majority-Muslim Palestinian states, given that there is not a single majority Muslim country in the world that is close to as socially liberal as Israel is, even now. Especially given that Muslim majority countries have a tendency to start employing Sharia law, even in Malaysia, far separated from the Middle-Eastern Muslim world. reply skissane 5 hours agorootparent> If Israel and the Palestinian territories were to become combined into a single state, it would no longer have a strong Jewish majority and would also cease to have its strong secular minority.

[0] If that&#x27;s right, Israel could well end this century with a majority of the population being Haredi, and Haredi parties in control of the Knesset and Israeli government. I doubt a socially liberal Israeli government could be possible in that circumstance; whatever remains of the secular minority may not be \"strong\", it may be politically weakened, demoralised, and increasingly diminished by emigration and a low birth rate.And all that&#x27;s assuming there is no change to the relationship with the Palestinians. So maybe a change won&#x27;t do as much as you think – it might just hasten the inevitable.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haaretz.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;2023-05-22&#x2F;ty-article-opinio... reply incompatible 4 hours agorootparentprevI have the impression that Israel&#x27;s government does want a one state solution, but only after expelling as many as possible of the Palestinians into neighbouring countries to join those already in exile; they certainly don&#x27;t want to grant them Israeli citizenship. reply insickness 8 hours agorootparentprev> Most Israelis don&#x27;t want thatBecause it would mean the end of a Jewish state. Combine Israel and Palestine and you get roughly 50% Jews, 50% Arabs. (5.3M Arabs in Palestine, 7.1M Jews in Israel and 2M Arabs in Israel). reply YZF 7 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s workable with a constitution that guarantees rights for Jews such that the 50% Arabs can&#x27;t change that and with a long slow process of building that single state (30 years? 50 years?). There might need to be other safeguards, Arabs today don&#x27;t really serve in the IDF so maybe that would need to continue.What else is the long term trajectory here? Israel can&#x27;t keep occupying Palestinians indefinitely (and I&#x27;m using the term \"occupy\" in the Israeli meaning, not in the Palestinian meaning, fwiw). Two states as we&#x27;ve seen is not going to work. Anyways, I know this is a hard time to talk about this. reply reissbaker 6 hours agorootparentAdding a larger population that doesn&#x27;t serve in the army isn&#x27;t going to help IMO — the non-religious Jews are already very mad about the carveouts for Haredim not serving in the army. An \"equal state\" where a Jewish minority are forced into the military or else imprisoned, and the non-Jews aren&#x27;t, is not going to go well.Two states are much better than one in my opinion, and the PA-led pseudo-state is much better than Hamas-controlled Gaza. Israel and Palestine need a manageable divorce, not a forced and unhappy marriage.Regardless, the PA does not advocate for one state, Hamas does not advocate for one state, and the vast majority of Israelis do not want one state, so I think this is kind of a moot point. reply fakedang 5 hours agorootparentThey only stopped advocating for one state after the Arabs suffered humiliating losses against the Israelis in all those wars (where the Arabs were the aggressors). Given the choice between a one state Palestinian country where Jews are a repressed minority, and a two state solution with a trillion dollar aid package for Palestine, the Palestinians will still choose the first option. reply reissbaker 1 hour agorootparentThe PA and Hamas never advocated for one state. If by \"they\" you mean \"the Palestinians in 1948,\" the Palestinians in 1948 did not advocate for one state for both Jews and Arabs either. They explicitly advocated for genocide, and wanted one state with just them and with no Jews at all — their leader explicitly said he wanted a second Holocaust in the Middle East (and had formerly volunteered for the Nazis). reply fakedang 2 minutes agorootparentSorry, that is exactly what I had meant (which I didn&#x27;t stress upon further). Palestinians only want a \"one state solution\", as long as it is a Palestinian state where Jews are either repressed or genocided.rayiner 8 hours agorootparentprevArabs rejected a two-state solution at the very inception of Israel. An Arab majority Israel-Palestine would drive out its Jews, just as every other Arab country has done. reply Georgelemental 7 hours agorootparentArabs rejected gettingArabs got the vast majority of the landI was (obviously) referring to their share of the population of Mandatory Palestine specifically. reply rayiner 6 hours agorootparentMandatory Palestine was an artificial creation of the British, which existed less than 30 years. For the 400 years before that, it was part of a single Ottoman province along with what is now Syria and Jordan (except for Jerusalem which was split off into a separate distinct in 1872).Talking about “how much of Mandatory Palestine the Arabs got” is contrived, when it was just a part of a much larger Arab territory under the Ottomans, and was planned to be part of a much larger Arab territory after the Ottomans. reply Georgelemental 5 hours agorootparentYes, what really mattered to the ordinary people on the ground wasn&#x27;t the borders on a map; it was \"my family has lived in this house and farmed this land for generations, but now men with guns say the house belongs to them and we have to leave.\" reply JamesBarney 1 hour agorootparentYou think a forced expulsion from their homes is what drove the 1948 war? reply tdeck 6 hours agorootparentprevThis argument completely ignores both the cultural distinctions between the different areas of the former Ottoman empire, and the fact that a person&#x27;s home is not interchangeable with any other place. Nobody would expect a Polish person in 1939 to say \"well, we Slavs have the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia so I guess it&#x27;s fine that German settlers took my farm at gunpoint and forced me to leave\".The implicit assumption is that any place with a majority of \"Arabs\" would ethnically cleanse all the Jews or become an Islamic theocracy, so we must view everything through the lens of competing ethno-states. It&#x27;s important to challenge this assumption. Ethno-states are inherently violent because every population is a mixture of different ethnicities, and an ethno-state needs to maintain a majority of a certain population. If the \"wrong\" group&#x27;s population grows in an ethno-state, it becomes a \"demographic problem\" that the government needs to \"solve\". This is why carving up the world into such states is never a lasting solution for peace.Aside: \"Arab\" and \"Jew\" are not mutually exclusive. You can be an Arab Jew in the same way you can be a Hispanic Jew - Arab is a distinction based on one&#x27;s mother language not one&#x27;s religion. This is why the Arab League includes countries in north Africa where most people aren&#x27;t descended from ancestral Arabians. The history of and literature of Judeo-Arabic is an interesting rabbit hole: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arab_Jews reply JamesBarney 1 hour agorootparentEvery nation in that area is an Islamic theocracy, monarchy, a failed state or a military dictatorship.If we waived a magic wand and made Palestine and Israel one country we wouldn&#x27;t have peace. We&#x27;d have a a bloody civil war that makes the current conflict look like childs play. reply rayiner 5 hours agorootparentprevMost of the world is competing ethnostates, including most if not all Arab states. (I’m certainly glad my parent’s generation secured our ethnostate, at great cost.) Whether there is a better way is an open question. But anybody would be an idiot to sacrifice their ethnostate for that experiment. It’s never ended well. reply Georgelemental 5 hours agorootparent> Anybody would be an idiot to sacrifice their ethnostateI&#x27;m sure Hamas feels the same way!

Almost none of the world is ethnostates. reply __loam 4 hours agorootparentCountries like China and Japan are de facto ethnostates. There&#x27;s also countries with religious majorities like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, and India, many of which are associated with an ethnicity. Saudi Arabia is named after the Arabs. You could make the argument that many European states have dominant ethnic groups like the French, though they are nominally secular nations.The biggest cosmopolitan countries are the United States and Brazil if I remember correctly. Maybe Canada too. Europe is moving in that direction. Countries that have a diverse citizenry are more of an exception though. Not that I disagree with your probable view that we should all live in diverse secular democracies, I just think your claim that almost none of the world is ethnostates is somewhat suspect.I agree with the idea that Israel would ideally be a single secular state, but navigating that transition while preserving it as the safest place the Jews of the world can go would be an enormous challenge. The situation sucks and resists simple answers. reply keepamovin 3 hours agorootparentGood analysis. Any ideas on solutions? reply __loam 3 hours agorootparentNot a fucking clue man. These people hate each other and they both have reason to. Maybe you need a solution administered by a third party like the UN but no solution is going to leave everyone happy, and the UN itself is pretty flawed.

Even if you had a solution that no one likes how do you force it on both parties?The UN doesn&#x27;t have the firepower to force Israel to do anything it doesn&#x27;t want to do, and doesn&#x27;t have the desire to force Palestine to do anything it doesn&#x27;t want to do. reply keepamovin 3 minutes agorootparentI suppose one approach is just sanction&#x2F;isolate the entire region, until both sides reach their own solution. But… unlikely the entire world would unite in that, resulting in incomplete sanctions and messy alliance networks, with probably new enemies for each in the aftermath, and sadly perhaps new “scores to settle” against those who sanctioned them.As an outsider to this feud, perhaps the best thing for me to do is not to judge either of them. I think it’s human to want to pick a side, but they’re not making it easy either way, by now.

China as an ethnostate is complicated (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chinese_Dream for some examples), but 91% of people in China are Han Chinese. That culture is predominant and the Chinese state has an official language associated with that identity. Likewise, foreigners make up just about 2% of the population in Japan (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immigration_to_Japan). Japan is known to be an insular country that has a reputation for xenophobia. That&#x27;s what I meant by de facto. Both countries have a dominant culture in a more pronounced way than the United States, for example. China also practices ethnic clensing with things like the Uyghur cultural genocide, which could be compared to some of the policies you linked. replyskissane 6 hours agorootparentprev> Palestinians did not reject a one state solution. Most Israelis don&#x27;t want that. I.e. annex the West Bank and Gaza and have a single country, let&#x27;s call it \"Israel-Palestine\".Hardliners in the current Israeli government (e.g Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich, Amichai Eliyahu) want to \"annex Judaea and Samaria\". There seems to be a bit of ambiguity about whether they mean only Area C, or the whole of the West Bank (or even annex Area C now as a precursor to annexing A and B later.)If they did that, what would happen to the Palestinians living in those areas – would they become Israeli Arabs? Would they first have to request Israeli citizenship? Would they be entitled to it, or would it be up to the Israeli government to decide whether to extend it to them?\"One state solution\" is an idea primarily associated with Israel&#x27;s peacenik far left, but maybe the best way to achieve it might (paradoxically) be to let the Israeli far right get a big chunk of what it wants?> If you want more radical ideas then if all Palestinian Arabs convert to Judaism we can also solve the problem pretty quickly...Speaking of radical ideas, I find the \"cantonization\" proposals [0] for the future of Israel rather fascinating. Basically convert it into a federation of different \"cantons\" representing the different sectors of Israeli society (secular, religious, Haredi, Arab).

Suddenly the \"binational one-state solution\" seems a lot closer to reality, as Arabs become an increasing percentage of Israeli citizens – even though what the hardliners actually wanted to achieve by annexation was the \"mononational one-state solution\" (Israel gets all the land while the Palestinians all leave and give up their Palestinian identity) reply Natsu 8 hours agorootparentprevThey might have to change what the UNRWA schools in Palestine (among others) are teaching to get people on board with that first:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;unrwa-continues-to-teac... reply fahhem 4 hours agorootparentThat report is based on policing the likes and shares in social media accounts of teachers, not on what they taught the children or what they themselves did or wrote.Imagine that was done here (in the US), those teachers might get a talking to, but nobody would buy that they&#x27;re teaching hate unless students or observers say something.If someone were to scrub your social media accounts, would they find 0 likes or shares of &#x27;hateful content&#x27;?

In short my answers are:How did Hamas come to power? Via democratic elections and by winning a subsequent civil war.What are their goals? Total Palestinian liberation and the restoration of the pre 1948 borders (a.k.a one state solution).How do they promise to achieve these goals? Via armed struggle, a.k.a. intifada and revolution.Hamas came into power after a fair democratic election in 2006. Outside observers monitored the elections and all agreed they were correct and fair. The only major interference actually came from Israel which backed the rival political group Fatah. Following the election the Palestinian civil war broke out in Gaza, which Hamas won. After which they took full control of the Gaza strip. There has not been an election since then, neither on Gaza nor on the West Bank. Aside: The legislative council in Gaza was demolished by the Israeli army last November.Meanwhile on the West Bank Fatah took power, where they control the Palestinian Authority. It is interesting to see the fate of the territory each faction controls. While Gaza suffers a blockade and constant military interventions, the West Bank is suffering from constant incursion from settlers and military raids as well as further partitioning of their lands, illegal settlements, military checkpoints, etc.In simple terms, Fatah supports the two state solution, among with most of the international community, which is why many Western nations view them as the legitimate government despite Hamas having won the election fair and square. Hamas on the other hand at first did not recognize Israel as a state, and wanted all of historic Palestine under Palestinian control. Since 2006 they have somewhat eased their stance against Israel, but are still calling for decolonization and one state.The Palestinian Authority (and Fatah by extension) is not popular among Palestinians. The way I understand it is that people view them as a colonial government, pandering to the interest of their colonizers. It is my understanding that Hamas is viewed favorably, as pandering to the interests of the colonizers has not left the West Bank in a nice state for the indigenous population.In short, in simple terms (as per my limited understanding), the two state solution is not seen as the right path inside Palestine, so people actually support Hamas’ one state solution, and see the fight for decolonization as legitimate. This may be a tough reality for westerners to accept as Hamas is only portrait by their very real and devastating atrocities, but seldomly seen as liberation fighters and never recognized for their decolonization efforts.Instead of relying on western analysis of the situation, I actually like to take in some historic comparisons. The Mau Mau in Kenya were indeed very brutal, and conducted very severe crimes against, however their fight—with the hindsight of history—was indeed very just, and resulted in the liberation of Kenya from the oppressive British colonial rule. Another example is FLN in Algeria, which probably had even more popular support then the Mau Mau, and were even more brutal in their fight against their French colonial oppressors. reply Georgelemental 7 hours agorootparent> The only major interference actually came from Israel which backed the rival political group Fatah.This is an oversimplification.

Israeli police officers were present to monitor the proceedings of the election. At the end of the day the Israeli authorities transferred the ballot boxes to the Palestinian Authority.[19]Question: How is withdrawing from Gaza interfering with the election while these actual examples of interference aren’t?It seems to me if your narration of history were true (which I’m not sure it is) then withdrawing from Gaza but not the West Bank was merely a dumb move, not interference.EDIT: To be clear, I don’t believe—as did observers at the time—that these interference efforts had a significant impact on the results.

Different agencies are not held to the same standard and they might not have the same goals, Hamas is mainly a military wing, while the Gazan health ministry cares for the health and survival of their people.Also, Israel keeps track of every person born and dead in Gaza, they have state-wide surveillance there, they could have chosen to send in surgical strike forces and taken out the militants strategically, but instead chose to carry out one of the heaviest bombardments in the current decades.

Collateral damage really is something different.> But I don’t believe for one second that Israel’s hands are so sufficiently constrained that the current degree of civilian death is necessary.(For the record, I&#x27;m Israeli)This is a hard question to answer. No one actually knows, because given fog of war and given the incentives of both sides, it&#x27;s hard to get real numbers for what&#x27;s going on. Not to mention that what even counts as \"necessary\"? Obviously zero civilian deaths is the only legitimate goal, but just as obviously this is impossible to achieve in practice. (I&#x27;d also add that zero deaths of militants is the goal, if possible - anyone that can be stopped by arresting them or causing them to surrender should be dealt with that way - though obviously this is even harder to achieve.)Given all that, I think a few points I&#x27;ll say, again speaking as an Israeli citizen with my own particular biases:1. While I highly mistrust our current government (like many Israelis), I certainly don&#x27;t think most of our government would condone killing civilians completely unnecessarily. At least not the ones in charge, mostly.2. More importantly, I trust the IDF a lot (and this is probably a big difference between me and most non-Israelis). While I&#x27;m sure that not literally every civilian death is legitimate, I do trust that the IDF is only attacking valid targets given reasonable intelligence, and that it&#x27;s not knowingly targeting civilians for the most part.3. Most importantly - taking the outside view - the IDF estimates that it&#x27;s killing roughly 2 civilians for 1 militant killed. If you believe that number - it&#x27;s roughly in line with similar wars fought by Western countries.Note: While I talk about civilian deaths here as a \"statistic\", every death is a horrible tragedy. In a good world, no one would ever have to die of violence, and good people should mourn the deaths of any person on any side of this horrible situation. reply pxc 2 hours agorootparentprevThere was lots of criticism of disprortionality in the US&#x27; wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

How many Germans died vs Americans in WW2? If we&#x27;re going by ratio more than 100 German civilians were killed for every American civilian.As a pragmatist, I see Israel as a relatively liberal democracy with Arab Muslims in their parliament, women and gays have civil rights, the society is open and innovative. Many Arab nations do not have these properties, and their ideologies often oppose them in principle.That said, I do not think Israel should be defended to the inordinate degree it has, which is due to American imperial interests, the military industrial complex, and many elite Jews which have disproportionate influence in American society. Look at the major CEOs of corporations in tech, finance, media, etc.It&#x27;s also harsh and dark to imagine, but sometimes we benefit from being the inheritors of evil actions that finalized a blood feud or enforced homogeneity. China is unified in large part because of the repression of their totalitarian state. Roughly 92% of China is ethnically Han, which is mostly just a bunch of Chinese ethnicities that were culturally assimilated into being called Han after the Han dynasty. America doesn&#x27;t have to deal with an insurgency of Comanches because they&#x27;re utterly out numbered by American citizens and weaponry. Israelis do not have these advantages, and would be at major risk of being conquered by the many more numerous Arab Muslims, who too were the result of oppressive and evil military campaigns of Mohammad and subsequent Muslim warriors. reply dotancohen 7 hours agorootparentprevNo, I find the idea of deliberately killing even a single Palestinian disgusting.

In the legal codes with which I am familiar mens rea matters.Murder is not just worse than manslaughter it is on a different level.Western criminal codes generally allow for no punishment, perhaps even no guilt, for a manslaughter.

Almost by definition suggesting that scale is a factor is implying that collective punishment is acceptable. reply jltsiren 6 hours agorootparentScale is the most important factor when talking about the harm done. A dead person is dead, regardless of if it was murder or manslaughter.Criminal punishments are more about the social consequences than about the crime itself. If someone gets X years in prison for crime A and another person gets 2X years for crime B, it doesn&#x27;t mean that crime B was twice as bad. It only means that after taking a large number of factors into account, it made sense to give twice as long sentence for crime B. reply creato 5 hours agorootparentIntent matters, and disregarding it disables your ability to determine right from wrong.

He was talking about damage to Hamas&#x2F;military targets. He did say that Israel is biased towards more damage vs. accuracy.This is very propaganda. I&#x27;ve been following the conflict pretty closely and I speak Hebrew. The parent is correct, there is and was no order to massacre civilians.It&#x27;s probably safe to say that protecting Palestinian civilians is not Israel&#x27;s main priority, but there&#x27;s a big difference between that and painting a picture of Israel trying to massacre as many civilians as possible. reply jakelazaroff 10 hours agorootparentIs that meant to be exculpatory? If you say that you&#x27;re attacking military targets that are (allegedly) embedded within civilian infrastructure and that you&#x27;re focused on damage rather than accuracy, you are telling me that you intend to massacre civilians. reply YZF 9 hours agorootparentI think there&#x27;s a difference in emphasis and intent. We&#x27;re painting pictures here. So one picture we&#x27;re painting is \"kill as many civilians a possible with no other military objective\" and the other picture we&#x27;re painting is \"go after military targets even at some cost to civilians (and the question of that cost)\". The reality is that in every way, every military in the world, executes the second picture. The variable being what is a reasonable threshold for the given military objective. The accusations against Israel intentionally try to place it in the first picture.If the critics were clear about their issue being how Israel measures proportionality with respect to every single target they go after, and they were able to support their case comparing to other similar military campaigns, and there was a very clear outcome of that comparison, I think that&#x27;s very fair and I&#x27;d even be able to get behind it. But that&#x27;s not what the critics are doing. reply jakelazaroff 9 hours agorootparentIf you’re not going to be satisfied with anything short of Netanyahu on tape saying “our intent is to kill as many Palestinian civilians as possible”verbatim, then we can just end this conversation now. Even the US would probably be forced to meaningfully withdraw support if Israel fully took the mask off (though as I’ve shown, many high ranking ministers and IDF members have come shockingly close).What you hear instead are thinly-veiled justifications. Oh, we had to bomb those hospitals because there were tunnels there. So sorry about the civilian deaths at a refugee camp, but we just wanted to get that one commander.Let’s be real here. Israel shut off food, water, medicine and electricity to Gaza. They’ve damaged over 2&#x2F;3 of the buildings there [1]. As of a month ago, they’d dropped almost 2x the amount of explosives the US delivered to Hiroshima [2].These are not the actions of a country “going after military targets even at some cost to civilians”. Israel is doing exactly what Hagari said: inflicting maximum damage.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;tksshawa&#x2F;status&#x2F;1732447886237974898[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;longform&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;9&#x2F;israel-att... reply Natsu 8 hours agorootparentIf they&#x27;re planning to just kill everyone, why haven&#x27;t they just leveled the place? Militarily speaking, they can do that right now and have been able to do that for a long time. So if that&#x27;s their true goal, then what stops them from giving the order right now?Meanwhile, Palestine has shown no restraint at all in their 10&#x2F;7 massacre and no Jews live in Palestine, whereas many Arabs live peacefully in Israel. reply jakelazaroff 7 hours agorootparentI already answered your question.Your second point is wrong, by the way. There are hundreds of thousands of Jews living in settlements in the West Bank. reply Natsu 7 hours agorootparentOnly if you want to claim that words are more revealing of intentions than actions, which would discredit you.The hospital they bombed had the parking lot damaged by a failed Hamas rocket. The \"refugee camp\" has been there for many years, not as huddled fleeing masses, but permanent structures from people who fled there long ago, the tunnel network is well known and there&#x27;s video evidence, the aid was being supplied by Israel to begin with (including the water) and they were using the pipes to make weapons, etc.So I&#x27;m not surprised to find that none of your other points make sense either. reply jakelazaroff 5 hours agorootparentSure, let’s look at their actions:- Killed almost 18,000 people- Displaced 1.9 million people- Cut off food, water, medicine, fuel, electricity and Internet access- Limited press access except for footage reviewed by the IDF- Dropped ~2x as much explosive as the US dropped in Hiroshima- Damaged over 2&#x2F;3 of buildings- Bombed basically every hospital- Bombed an ambulance- Told people to move south and then bombed Rafah crossing, on the border with Egypt- Kidnapped thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank- Tortured Palestinian abductees- Handed out weapons to West Bank settlers- Stripped civilians and paraded them through the streetsThis is all after October 7th — before that, Israeli settlers were responsible for pogroms and dozens of murders in the West Bank. reply YZF 2 hours agorootparentI would like to nitpick your list if that&#x27;s ok. I think being very precise is really important here. If there are uncertainties then those should be spelled out as well. Once we know the facts we can have a better discussion (not just the facts related to this list but the complete picture).- Israel did displace a lot of people. Partly for their own safety while Israel attacks the area they live in. I think your number are correct.- We already covered the \"cut off\" in another thread so I (edit: didn&#x27;t want to but I guess I did anyways) want revisit it. Water was off, and then on, food and medicine are allowed in but maybe not enough, Internet access is on most of the time in this war zone, electricity is mostly cut off (partly because the power station ran out of fuel I think, not strictly because Israel cut it off). This is a snarky comment but I&#x27;m pretty sure the tunnel vents still have power. Northern Gaza and Southern Gaza are also different (with more restrictions on Northern Gaza). I would call this statement misleading.- Israel did drop a lot of bomb tonnage on Gaza but we can&#x27;t really compare this to the atomic weapons dropped on Hiroshima. There were 60-80 thousand dead in Hiroshima which was much less populated&#x2F;dense than Gaza (total population was about 350,000). As a piece of trivia, between 241,000 and 900,000 people died in Japan in the bombing campaigns of WW2. I would fact check this statement as misleading.- There is plenty of press access from the Palestinian side. I think we&#x27;re getting more footage from the war zone compared to many other war zones. Israel does review footage of press that embeds with the IDF in Gaza for operational-security reasons. I think that&#x27;s pretty normal. I don&#x27;t recall large complaints from the media about this, but they do note it in their reports. So correct but misleading.- Do you have a reference for \"dozens of murders by settlers prior to Oct 7th\"? Are you going all the way back to Baruch Goldstein? Even with that \"dozens\" seems incorrect to me. There&#x27;s no room for any violence by settlers but let&#x27;s get the facts right. My very quick research has failed to substantiate this claim.- Reference for \"paraded them through the streets\"? Also do we know they&#x27;re all civilians? Israel strips people they arrest (to their underwear) to make sure they&#x27;re not suicide bombers. I have seen those photos&#x2F;videos as well. I agree it&#x27;s pretty humiliating (and) the pictures didn&#x27;t look good. I hope the people that are uninvolved will be released quickly. I know you&#x27;re going to take issue with what I say here, but this was in Northern Gaza where civilians have been asked to evacuate and Hamas combatants operate in civilian clothing. Hamas has a lot of history with suicide bombers so it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect this tactic. I would call this partly misleading.- I also take issue with \"kidnapped\" and \"tortured\". I would say arrested Islamic Jihad and Hamas activists. Torture is illegal in Israel (maybe allowed if there&#x27;s a \"ticking bomb\", I don&#x27;t recall) and while it&#x27;s possible there have been cases I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s systemic, any evidence to the contrary?- You&#x27;re technically correct about the move south and bomb the south but I think it&#x27;s important to note there was significantly less bombing in the south than the north and Israel has said specifically they will still bomb the south if they have clear targets. Israel never said it won&#x27;t bomb the south. It just said it&#x27;s safer. And if you check the statistics you&#x27;ll see that&#x27;s true. This is where \"technically right\" can be misleading.- West bank settlers have had weapons forever pretty much. Most of the handing of weapons these days is to people in Israel proper.- I think there was a single incident with an ambulance where Israel claimed it was being used for a military purpose. There is a long discussion about the status and usage of ambulances here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lieber.westpoint.edu&#x2F;attacks-misuse-ambulances-durin...- I&#x27;m pretty sure \"bombed every hospital\" is false. Reference? We had the possible Islamic Jihad rocket falling in a hospital parking lot, we had some bombings close to hospitals, we had fake news from other conflicts presented as Israel bombing hospitals, but \"bombed every hospital\" is new to me. I think \"did not bomb any hospitals\" is closer to the truth. How many people were killed by Israel&#x27;s bombing of hospitals?- I&#x27;ve seen different accounts for the percentage of buildings damaged. 2&#x2F;3 seems on the high side. References? reply bluish29 7 hours agorootparentprev> Meanwhile, Palestine has shown no restraint at all in their 10&#x2F;7 massacre and no Jews live in Palestine, whereas many Arabs live peacefully in Israel.Do you realize that isreal is the side who killed at least 10x the number that the other side kill. I can see that you describe hamas&#x27;s action as horrible but there is no way of condition that justifies what isreal did and is still doing to Palestinian civilians (no matter how you think you can) reply YZF 2 hours agorootparentThis is one relevant read:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;3035937&#x2F;gaza-israel-hamas-palestinian-casua...Why are we playing this numbers game? If Hamas hypothetically had killed 30,000 Israels would you be saying that Israel still has 12,000 to go? Every person matters and in a war there are no targets for how many people are killed, in wars people get killed for achieving some other objectives. I would imagine that even if Hamas had only killed 150 people in Israel we&#x27;d be in exactly the same place and the ratio would be 100x because there&#x27;s a point where Israel has to (well, at least they think) reoccupy Gaza at any cost. Israel was almost there in previous conflicts, but backed off.There is no war in history, as far as I know, but willing to be corrected, where the measure or who is wrong and who is right, or when the war should end, was some threshold or ratio in the number of dead people. A war continues until both sides agree to stop it. Wars have a terrible human price. I think something like 400,000 people have died in the war in Yemen. I think there are hundreds of thousands of dead in the Russian-Ukraine war (mostly soldiers but they&#x27;re people, and young people, too. Many civilians.). Sudan is pretty bad. 600,000 killed in the Syria civil war. reply Natsu 7 hours agorootparentprevIsrael could kill literally everyone though, and has been able since long before this. So the idea that they&#x27;re not restrained in their response ignores that capability.As to the latter part, you&#x27;re pulling a trick to imply that the 10x are all civilian non-combatants, which is just as bad as the other people pretending that all the teen-aged Hamas soldiers who have been killing people are non-combatant children. replyYZF 8 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m honestly not sure how to engage in this discussion.

    "originBody": "Dieselgate, but for trains – some heavyweight hardware hacking 0 SHARES ShareTweet [this is an English translation of the original article in Polish, we occasionally publish the best cyber stories from Poland in English] A train manufactured by a Polish company suddenly broke down during maintenance. The experts were helpless – the train was fine, it just wouldn’t run. In a desperate last gasp, the Dragon Sector team was called in to help, and its members found wonders the train engineers had never dreamed of. In this story, we will take you on an unusual journey. A journey full of unexpected discoveries and events, a journey under pressure of time and money, as well as unusual technologies. A journey in which the train plays the most important role – although unfortunately it doesn’t move, even though it should. Fasten your seatbelts – or at least sit comfortably, because there are sharp turns ahead. Winning the tender, losing the service The story probably begins a little earlier, but we will enter the scene in spring 2022, when the maintenance for the first of eleven Impuls 45WE trains (made by Polish company Newag) operated by the Lower Silesian Railways ends. The maintenance is carried out by an independent train maintenance company called Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych, hereafter referred to as SPS, SPS won the tender to carry out the mandatory maintenance of the trains after a distance of 1,000,000 kilometres. The train manufacturer, Newag, also competed in the tender to carry out the maintenance, but the manufacturer’s bid was about 750k USD higher and the tender was eventually won by SPS, which offered to carry out the maintenance of 11 trains for around 5.5 mln USD. Maintenance a train is a complicated affair – it has to be taken apart, the parts sent to the various manufacturers, checked, sent back, the train put back together again and tested. The SPS carries out the maintenance procedures according to the relevant maintenance manual (some 20,000 pages) provided by the manufacturer, but the train does not start after being put together. The computer says everything is fine, the train is ready to run – but it does not run. The inverters are not supplying voltage to the motors and no one has any idea why this is happening. Maintenance technicians search, check, verify, consult the manuals – they find no answer. Mysterious breakdowns The Lower Silesian Railway has eleven Impulses and, according to the schedule, another one is about to be sent for maintenance, while the first – instead of returning to work – is still sitting in the workshop. The second train is undergoing an identical maintenance, with identical results. Before the maintenance it was operating, after the maintenance it no longer wants to run. The work on getting the first train up and running, like the train itself, has not progressed one millimetre, while the manufacturer refuses to help. Two immobile trains are already sitting in the workshop. The third misses its inspection due to battery failure, so a fourth train (“from the future”) is sent to the maintenance instead. The maintenance company wants to take advantage of its presence to tow one of those that won’t run. When the fourth (running) train is connected to one of the stationary ones, the running one also comes to a standstill (the reason for this has not yet been established). In addition, at another workshop in another Polish town, Szczecin, another Impulse breaks down in very similar circumstances – it does not start up after servicing. Poland’s top hackers At a certain point, the problem becomes serious enough to be noticed by the media – the six longest trains of the Lower Silesian Railway out of service mean that timetables have to be reduced, replacement trains have to be sent to the tracks, and passengers travel in overcrowded, shorter trainsets. Newag explains that the trains were blocked by a “safety system” – but in the 20,000 pages of instructions, it is in vain to find even a mention of it. A day of train downtime in the workshop costs over 1000 USD in contractual penalties, and there are several trains stuck, so the tension level in the SPS is rising. Since neither the mechanics nor the electricians have a solution, someone types “Polish hackers” into Google and comes across an article about the Dragon Sector group’s successes in the CTF arena at the top of the results list. SPS makes contact with DS, whose representatives at first can’t believe the proposal they hear. Train hacking? Well, why not. The parties sign a contract. Dragon Sector members Michał “Redford” Kowalczyk and Sergiusz “q3k” Bazański, known for hacking Toshiba laptops, take on the project, and Kuba “PanKleszcz” Stępniewicz, who has experience in industrial automation, joins in. The team set off briskly to work, with Kuba taking a trip to the workshop. On site, they get a train that doesn’t move, two spare computers and the computer manufacturer’s SDK files. They start the work by tapping into the CAN bus, but it’s difficult to read the traffic without documentation of the protocols. They take a long time trying to dump the embedded software from the on-board computer. They have no documentation of the computer and the SDK only allows uploading new software, with no option to dump existing software. As they experiment with the older version of the software they found, uploading it to the first spare computer causes it to stop responding – they are left with only one working spare computer. Eventually, they find a debugging interface and download the device’s memory byte by byte. The computer is based on the TriCore architecture, like many similar solutions in the automotive industry. Unfortunately, there is a lack of good disassemblers, so the researchers are improving Ghidra a bit and can finally look into the code. Admittedly, strings are missing, but the work is slowly moving forward. A month and a half goes by when the SPS passes on the bad news. As the deadline chases and trains break down The Lower Silesian Railway, unable to wait for its trains, decides to cooperate with Newag on the repair of broken trainsets and their maintenance, including trains which, according to the original tender, were yet to be sent for maintenance at SPS. The rupture of the contract with SPS is expected to take place in a week’s time. As is well known, nothing affects the intensity of the work as much as a very close deadline by which the result has to be shown, so the researchers set to work with redoubled energy. In the course of their work so far, they have downloaded the memory contents of a number of computers, both trains that are working and those that should only be working. Comparing these images is an ordeal, as almost every train has a different set of functions and a different version of software, but slowly they are starting to get a feel for something. They identify values in the computers’ memory that are set in one train and zeroed out in another. They can run tests at their desks – the computer, even when taken out of the train, lets it run for a while (before realising it’s missing the rest of the train) to show whether it’s ready to run the inverters. There is less than a day left until the deadline for completion when they find the configuration of flags that gives the train a chance to run. Unfortunately, during the experiments, the last working on-board computer burns out. Yes, it burns – a capacitor burns (a rather random occurrence). After another brainstorm and many attempts to put the two damaged computers into one, they manage to repair the burnt one and at 2am, the night before doomsday, the researchers configure a computer to start the train. One of the researchers boards a train (of a different operator) to arrive with the presumably working computer at the workshop just before the representatives of the Lower Silesian Railway, who have announced a visit for 9:30 a.m. Unfortunately, the train on which the researcher travels to the maintenance company is late. Eventually, in the morning, the researcher with the computer arrives at the site, connects the pray-it-works-computer to the broken-down train, but the train does not start. Another brainstorm identifies one flag that was forgotten and at 8:42 the train manages to start. The Lower Silesian Railway delegation, seeing at 9:30 that the trains have a chance of getting back to life after all, does not break the contract with SPS. Why the train broke down Figuring out how to get the train to run wasn’t even half the battle – you still had to figure out why it broke down, and this is where the thrill ride begins. Months of analysis and reverse engineering uncovered some extremely interesting conditions written into the software code of various trains supplied by Newag. After hundreds of hours spent on code dumped from dozens of trainsets, it was possible to identify some very interesting mechanisms causing sudden train sickness. The numerical values 53.13845 and 17.99011 found in the computer code seemed familiar at first glance. It soon became apparent that these were GPS coordinates pointing to the vicinity of Bydgoszcz Główny Railway Station, specifically the PESA (another Polish train producer and maintenance center) site located next to it. Soon the coordinates of other maintenance centers that could carry out train repairs and maintenance in Poland were also found. Below we show the pseudo-code of the algorithm (the names of the variables or functions are given by the researchers for clarity – we do not know what the original names were): check1 = 53.13845 lock_function_test & 1); check5 = 53.10244 CAN converter”, presumably enabling remote communication with the train. Removing it did not make anything stop working. Analysis showed that the on-board computer was sending lock status information to this device, and that the device itself was connected to a GSM modem. Not only in Wrocław Information that the SPS maintenance center succeeded in repairing Newag’s ‘broken’ trainsets quickly found its way to other companies as well. It turned out to be quite a common problem. In Wrocław they analysed 13 Impulses, but there were also broken ones running in Kolej Mazowieckie (one), two in Opole, four in Krakow, one in Zielona Góra, four in Szczecin and one in Warsaw. Fortunately, each was able to be repaired using a tool developed by our researchers that removes software locks from the on-board computer. In total, the researchers analysed the software of 29 trains and in all but five they found surprises beyond the official operating instructions. What’s next We leave it to the readers and customers of this company to assess the solutions used by the manufacturer. Interestingly, although there is litigation in the case, it is hard to find an institution in Poland that has done anything beyond kindly expressing interest in the matter. We are not aware of any action taken either by the Office of Consumer and Competition Protection or by the Railway Transport Office, which would seem to be competent to eliminate from the market practices that are damaging to local government organisations that are incurring considerable losses and to passengers who are forced to travel in crowds or use substitute transport for months. The only institution that has taken action that we are aware of is CERT Polska, notified of the discovery by the researchers. From the comment we received, it appears that CERT Polska has notified the “relevant authorities” and the case is being handled by law enforcement agencies. We congratulate the best Polish hackers on their interesting discovery and professional execution of the assignment. Remember, nothing motivates you like a deadline tomorrow morning. The above article is only a cursory summary of the presentation given at the Oh My H@ck conference on 5 December 2023 by members of the team consisting of Jakub Stępniewicz, Sergiusz Bazański and Michał Kowalczyk. The article omits a lot of detail and a whole sizable technical section of the analysis – it remains to be hoped that the authors of the study can be motivated to write it up and publish it. 0 SHARES ShareTweet",

Using a single, common ECU (which is both complicated to manufacture and doesn&#x27;t directly influence performance [0]) saves all the teams (bar McLaren) from having to go down a rabbit hole of doing semiconductor design and manufacturing and makes it easy for the governing body to enforce rules about how the ECU is configured.[0] How the ECU is configured does, but the ECU itself doesn&#x27;t reply dghlsakjg 17 hours agorootparentprevMost of F1&#x27;s \"innovation\" is around finding ways to beat the rules, not necessarily coming up with new technologies. reply jtriangle 17 hours agorootparentprevOne could easily argue that F1 hasn&#x27;t innovated much in the last decade or so.

Even the limited sim time is a problem, because there are certainly optimizations left on the table that can&#x27;t really be found otherwise. What you wind up with is a A-team and a B-team of mostly the same designs. That&#x27;s booring, and moreso because if the cars really were 100% standardized, at very least it&#x27;d be competitive in terms of driver skill.It&#x27;s why these days, I don&#x27;t watch much F1, I much prefer the more &#x27;indie&#x27; racing leagues where, on any given raceday, anyone can win.

New LCD Screens inside trains&#x2F;busses and outside working with a modern software setup (using an OS, often with a pc architecture, quite often just displaying a website) are broken ~10%-20% of the time. Looking at (for example) busses, a large portion of the time the screen will either be blank, not display anything, old information or just wrong information. Going inside fast food restaurants with large LCDs for the menu, often something is broken, frozen or something else.It is of course possible to make modern software more reliable. It&#x27;s just much, much harder than making embedded software or PLC programming reliable. Software can be easily made more complex, but it&#x27;s hard to make it non-complex or to wrap the complexity so it isn&#x27;t an issue anymore. The ecosystem isn&#x27;t set up for non-complexity. reply trealira 17 hours agorootparentI think to make software more reliable, you&#x27;d have to go back to the \"waterfall\" method of development.If we went back to Dijkstra&#x27;s notion of correctness by construction, then a specification for the program would be made, and then a programmer would prove their part of the code correct to the specification. They would write the precondition and postcondition of every effectful statement, document the invariant of every loop, and prove by induction that each loop does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Basically, annotate your program with Hiare triples. (There are books about how to do this). Then, extensive tests should be run for as much of rhe program as possible.Nowadays, we have tools for this so that we don&#x27;t actually have to write a proof by induction for every loop; instead, we have bounded model checkers. In theory, the manual proof writing could be isolated to the parts of the program whose properties a bounded model checker cannot verify.However, it seems like this whole plan is infeasible unless regulations are written that enforce this onto the industry. It would make them a lot less productive, and therefore less profitable. The only benefit would be that software is more reliable. By necessity, it would have to become simpler, too. For instance, there&#x27;s absolutely no way that web browsers like Chromium, with 38 million lines of code, will ever be verified, because they&#x27;re too large and complex. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentSuch regulations exist for avionics and aerospace.

IMO there are a few efforts to modernize PLC programming but I feel like they are still stuck in the 1990s software development. Take a look at Codesys, got Git support few years ago and in very bad shape. How do you test your code, in the field or buy another Codesys testing plugin....which is in rough shape.The issue is as machines get way more complex this issue gets worse. Also there are generations of PLC devs that still want to stick with ladder logic. Huge fragmentation. reply applied_heat 10 hours agorootparentLadder is a fine choice for visually animating Boolean logicThe fact is the unmodernized plc platforms deliver working machines and plants. The projects are built, commissioned, and unlike modern software they are finished and left to operate instead of constantly modified With no benefit to the end user reply Kim_Bruning 8 hours agorootparent... sort of. Past a certain level of complexity you get into trouble with just PLC programmers alone.Don&#x27;t get me wrong.tend to also have electrical skills and some are pretty good at their jobs, and you can learn a lot from them!But ... they&#x27;re not programmer programmers. It&#x27;s a different skill-set with only so much overlap. reply applied_heat 7 hours agorootparentThe ladder paradigm has its place, as does function block diagrams, as does what the plc vendors call ‘structured text’.controlling physical processes like oil refineries, power generation, or sawmills is different from most computer programs as are the consequences of bugs or errors so it makes sense that it takes different people with different interests and skills. replyewweezdsd 19 hours agoparentprevSometimes low-tech is just better.

They&#x27;re still very reliable, and now somewhat more efficient. reply notyofriend 14 hours agorootparentOld electronics of that era could be drawn by a simple schematic and usually only performed one or 2 functions. That makes designing a drop in replacement very easy. reply danhor 19 hours agoparentprevThat is also my impression as well. The softwareization of trains has led to deep regressions in both basic reliability and interoperability&#x2F;flexilibity. Many modern trains suffer from software issues for basic driving [0] and delays when getting the software approved [1]. But the loss of compatability is in my opinion the worst regression. Modern EMUs basically only work together with other EMUs of the same batch. Even the same model ordered by two different companies often don&#x27;t work together and basically forget about trying to use EMUs of different companies or ordered over a decade apart together. Meanwhile pre-digital everything it was common to use e.g. trams of different generations together and rewire them to work with each other. Older train cars work together without issues, good luck trying to use an IC2 and a Railjet together (or a RailJet and ICE-L). Even certain locomotives and train cars would often only work with each other.It is way harder for different computerized systems to work together due to the higher complexity and more obfuscation (a traditional logic circuitboard is often easily reverse engineered. Reverse engineering software is a very specialized task). This is also very noticeable in other sectors, where interoperability has become much worse due to moving to proprietary digital protocols.This is in part due to the difficulty in getting software approved as compared to previous tech (due to software being so intransparent) but also because of truly lacking quality. One of the reasons Bombardier was so deep in trouble was bad software, even leading to a contract of over 40 ordered trains just being cancelled ([2]).In my opinion building reliable (and understandable) software is way harder than building logic or even mechanical systems. I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, but it&#x27;s been a problem for a long time.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrt.be&#x2F;vrtnws&#x2F;de&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;12&#x2F;belgische_bahn_storn...

Further, if we look at Boeing&#x27;s recent issues with the 737Max, it&#x27;s the same thing. In both of these cases, the bad software was almost certainly ordered to be written by management acting fraudulently for profit. The one error that has been discussed in the article was a stupid mistake, quite possibly due to the logic conditions being made overly complicated in order to enable the fraud, but the recurrent theme of all of the real underlying issues found was intentional design malfeasance, not incompetence. reply soco 20 hours agoparentprevYou could say that about most software where the fresher the framework the more glaring the holes - here&#x27;s a recent post about it: \"Software disenchantment\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tonsky.me&#x2F;blog&#x2F;disenchantment&#x2F; reply sofixa 16 hours agoparentprev> Minimal or no usage of digital electronicsEveryone in this thread seems to be forgetting that those might be useful and not just fancy toys.

You might not win the contract on price, but win it by default because you made it impossible for anyone else to complete it.That is until your scheme is uncovered because you left the GPS coordinates of your competitors workshops in your code. reply bluGill 19 hours agorootparentMore sanely (not to be confused with likely!) the courts will decide that since this is something only the OEM can do, it must done at no charge as part of normal warranty work. reply josefx 18 hours agorootparentThese trains will be used for decades.

This was not a \"just take your car to dave, he knows some stuff\". For SPS and other competitors this was like \"you need to show every certification that exists and certify all your tools to prove that indeed you can service those cars, or you will be foreclosed due to fines\".

Tenth place is a 70B model. While it&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s so much interest in 7B models, and it&#x27;s incredible that people are pushing them so far, I selfishly wish more effort would go into 13B models... since those are the biggest that my macbook can run.) reply behnamoh 3 hours agorootparentI think the current approach — train 7b models and then do MoE on them — is the future. It’ll still be only runnable on high end customer devices. As for 13b + MoE, I don’t think any customer device could handle that in the next couple years. reply stolsvik 43 minutes agorootparentI have no formal credentials to say this, but intuitively I feel this is obviously wrong. You couldn’t have taken 50 rats brains and “mixed” them and expected the result to produce new science.For some uninteresting regurgitation, sure. But size - width and depth - seems like an important piece for ability to extract deep understanding of the universe.Also, MoE, as I understand it, will inherently not be able to glean insight into, nor reason about, and certainly not be able to come up with novel understanding, for cross-expert areas.I believe size matters, a lot. reply sbierwagen 3 hours agorootparentprevMy years-old M1 macbook with 16GB of ram runs them just fine. Several Geforce 40-series cards have at least 16GB of vram. Macbook pros go up to 128GB of ram and the mac studio goes up to 192GB. Running regular CPU inference on lots of system ram is cheap-ish and not intolerably slow.These aren&#x27;t totally common configurations, but they&#x27;re not totally out of reach like buying an H100 for personal use. reply behnamoh 3 hours agorootparent1. I wouldn&#x27;t consider Mac Studio ($7,000) a customer product.2. Yes, and my MBP M1 Pro can run quantized 34b models. My point was that when you do MoE, memory requirements suddenly become too challenging. A 7b Q8 is roughly 7GB (7b parameters × 8 bits each). But 8x of that would be 56GB, and all of that must be in memory to run. reply brucethemoose2 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, absolutely. I was just preaching this.But its not totally irrelevant. They are still a datapoint to consider with some performance correlation. YMMV, but these models actually seem to be quite good for the size in my initial testing. reply nabakin 15 hours agorootparentprevMore or less. The automated benchmarks themselves can be useful when you weed out the models which are overfitting to them.Although, anyone claiming a 7b LLM is better than a well trained 70b LLM like Llama 2 70b chat for the general case, doesn&#x27;t know what they are talking about.In the future will it be possible? Absolutely, but today we have no architecture or training methodology which would allow it to be possible.You can rank models yourself with a private automated benchmark which models don&#x27;t have a chance to overfit to or with a good human evaluation study.Edit: also, I guess OP is talking about Mistral finetunes (ones overfitting to the benchmarks) beating out 70b models on the leaderboard because Mistral 7b is lower than Llama 2 70b chat. reply airgapstopgap 11 hours agorootparent> today we have no architecture or training methodology which would allow it to be possible.We clearly see that Mistral-7B is in some important, representative respects (eg coding) superior to Falcon-180B, and superior across the board to stuff like OPT-175B or Bloom-175B.\"Well trained\" is relative. Models are, overwhelmingly, functions of their data, not just scale and architecture. Better data allows for yet-unknown performance jumps, and data curation techniques are a closely-guarded secret. I have no doubt that a 7B beating our best 60-70Bs is possible already, eg using something like Phi methods for data and more powerful architectures like some variation of universal transformer. reply nabakin 2 hours agorootparentI mean, I 100% agree size is not everything. You can have a model which is massive but not trained well so it actually performs worse than a smaller, better&#x2F;more efficiently trained model. That&#x27;s why we use Llama 2 70b over Falcon-180b, OPT-175b, and Bloom-175b.I don&#x27;t know how Mistral performs on codegen specifically, but models which are finetuned for a specific use case can definitely punch above their weight class. As I stated, I&#x27;m just talking about the general case.But so far we don&#x27;t know of a 7b model (there could be a private one we don&#x27;t know about) which is able to beat a modern 70b model such as Llama 2 70b. Could one have been created which is able to do that but we simply don&#x27;t know about it? Yes. Could we apply Phi&#x27;s technique to 7b models and be able to reach Llama 2 70b levels of performance? Maybe, but I&#x27;ll believe it when we have a 7b model based on it and a human evaluation study to confirm. It&#x27;s been months now since the Phi study came out and I haven&#x27;t heard about any new 7b model being built on it. If it really was such a breakthrough to allow 10x parameter reduction and 100x dataset reduction, it would be dumb for these companies to not pursue it. reply brucethemoose2 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not saying its better than 70B, just that its very strong from what others are saying.Actually I am testing the 34B myself (not the 7B), and it seems good. reply nabakin 2 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m not saying its better than 70B, just that its very strong from what others are saying.Gotcha> Actually I am testing the 34B myself (not the 7B), and it seems good.I&#x27;ve heard good things about it reply fblgit 12 hours agorootparentprevUNA: Uniform Neural Alignment. Haven&#x27;t u noticed yet? Each model that I uniform, behaves like a pre-trained.. and you likely can fine-tune it again without damaging it.If you chatted with them, you know .. that strange sensation, you know what is it..

For instance, DPO requires \"good\" and \"bad\" responses for each given prompt. reply fblgit 11 hours agorootparentprevdoesn&#x27;t require much data, in a 7B can take a couple hours ~ reply valine 10 hours agorootparentThat’s cool. A couple hours on a single GPU or like 8x a100s? replyelcomet 14 hours agorootparentprevWe can only compare specific training procedures though.With a 7b and a 70b trained the same way, the 70b should always be better reply nabakin 2 hours agorootparentMakes sense reply mistrial9 11 hours agorootparentprevquick to assert authoritative opinion - yet the one word \"better\" belies the message ? Certainly there is are more dimensions worth including in the rating? reply nabakin 2 hours agorootparentCertainly, there may be aspects of a particular 7b model which could beat another particular 70b model and greater detail into different pros and cons of different models are worth considering but people are trying to rank models and if we&#x27;re ranking (calling one \"better\" than another), we might as well do it as accurately as we can since it can be so subjective.I see too many misleading \"NEW 7B MODEL BEATS GPT-4\" posts. People test those models a couple of times, come back to the comments section, declare it true, and onlookers know no better than to believe it and in my opinion has led to many people claiming 7b models have gotten as good as Llama 2 70b or GPT-4 when it is not the case when you account for the overfit being exhibited by these models and actually put them to the test via human evaluation. reply typon 13 hours agorootparentprevYes. The only thing that is relevant is a hidden benchmark that&#x27;s never released and run by a trusted third party. reply _boffin_ 15 hours agoparentprevInteresting. One thing i noticed is that Mistral has a `max_position_embeddings` of ~32k while these have it at 4096.Any thoughts on that? reply brucethemoose2 15 hours agorootparentIs complicated.The 7B model (cybertron) is trained on Mistral. Mistral is technically a 32K model, but it uses a sliding window beyond 32K, and for all practical purposes in current implementations it behaves like an 8K model.The 34B model is based on Yi 34B, which is inexplicably marked as a 4K model in the config but actually works out to 32K if you literally just edit that line. Yi also has a 200K base model... and I have no idea why they didn&#x27;t just train on that. You don&#x27;t need to finetune at long context to preserve its long context ability. reply ComputerGuru 10 hours agorootparentDid you mean \"but it uses a sliding window beyond\" *8K*? Because I don&#x27;t understand how the sentence would work otherwise. reply brucethemoose2 10 hours agorootparentYeah exactly, sorry. reply 3abiton 10 hours agoparentprevHF leaderboards are rarely reflective of real world performance especially in small variations, but nonetheless, this is promising. What are the HW requirements for this latest Mistral7B? reply eyegor 8 hours agorootparentAny 7b can run well (~50 tok&#x2F;s) on an 8gb gpu if you tune the context size. 13b can sometimes run well but typically you&#x27;ll end up with a tiny context window or slow inference. For cpu, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going above 1.3b unless you don&#x27;t mind waiting around. reply aarushsah 7 hours agorootparentHow so? I&#x27;m only getting 12 t&#x2F;s using Mistral in LM Studio. reply eyegor 7 hours agorootparentThe lazy way is to use text-generation-webui, use an exllamav2 conversion of your model, and turn down context length until it fits (and tick the 8 bit cache option). If you go over your vram it will cut your speed substantially. Like 60&#x2F;s down to 15&#x2F;s for an extra 500 context length over what fits. Similar idea applies to any other backends, but you need to shove all the layers into vram if you want decent tok&#x2F;s. To give you a starting point, typically for 7b models I have to use 4k-6k context length and I use 4-6 bit quantizations for an 8gb gpu. So start at 4 bit, 4k context and adjust up as you can.You can find most popular models converted for you on huggingface.co if you add exl2 to your search and start with the 4 bit quantized version. Don&#x27;t bother going above 6 bits even if you have spare vram, practically it doesn&#x27;t offer much benefit.For reference I max out around 60 tok&#x2F;s at 4bit, 50 tok&#x2F;s at 5bit, 40 at 6bit for some random 7b parameter model on a rtx 2070. reply brucethemoose2 10 hours agorootparentprev> What are the HW requirements for this latest Mistral7BPretty much anything with ~6-8GB of memory that&#x27;s not super old.It will run on my 6GB laptop RTX 2060 extremely quickly.

I am not sure, if outdated information can be tackled with RAG though, especially in coding.Just today, i asked GPT and Bard(Gemini) to write code using slint, neither of them had any idea of slint. Slint being a relatively new library, like two and a half (0.1 version) to one and a half (0.2 version) years back [1] is not something they trained on.Natural language doesn&#x27;t change that much over the course of a handful of years, but in coding 2 years back may as well be a century. My argument is that, SmallLMs not only they are relevant, they are actually desirable, if the best solution is to be retrained from scratch.If on the other hand a billion token context window proves to be practical, or the RAG technique solves most of use cases, then LLMs might suffice. This RAG technique, could it be aware, of million of git commits daily, on several projects, and keep it&#x27;s knowledge base up to date?

Doesn&#x27;t MoE select an expert for each token? Presumably, the same expert would frequently be selected for a number of tokens in a row. At that point, you&#x27;re only running a 7B model, which will easily fit on a GPU. It will be slower when \"swapping\" experts if you can&#x27;t fit them all into VRAM at the same time, but it shouldn&#x27;t be catastrophic for performance in the way that being unable to fit all layers of an LLM is. It&#x27;s also easy to imagine caching the N most recent experts in VRAM, where N is the largest number that still fits into your VRAM. reply ttul 17 hours agorootparentSomeone smarter will probably correct me, but I don’t think that is how MoE works. With MoE, a feed-forward network assesses the tokens and selects the best two of eight experts to generate the next token. The choice of experts can change with each new token. For example, let’s say you have two experts that are really good at answering physics questions. For some of the generation, those two will be selected. But later on, maybe the context suggests you need two models better suited to generate French language. This is a silly simplification of what I understand to be going on. reply wongarsu 16 hours agorootparentOne viable strategy might be to offload as many experts as possible to the GPU, and evaluate the other ones on the CPU. If you collect some statistics which experts are used most in your use cases and select those for GPU acceleration you might get some cheap but notable speedups over other approaches. reply ttul 17 hours agorootparentprevThis being said, presumably if you’re running a huge farm of GPUs, you could put each expert onto its own slice of GPUs and orchestrate data to flow between GPUs as needed.

If you have available RAM, it will hold on to pages that have been read from disk until there is enough memory pressure to remove them (and then it will only remove some of them, not all of them). If you don&#x27;t have available RAM, then the tmpfs wouldn&#x27;t work. The tmpfs is helpful if you know better than the paging subsystem about how much you really want this data to always stay in RAM no matter what, but that is also much less flexible, because sometimes you need to burst in RAM usage. reply tarruda 17 hours agoparentprevTheoretically it could fit into a single 24GB GPU if 4-bit quantized.

I think that&#x27;s noticably faster than every other consumer CPU out there. But it&#x27;s slower than a top Nvidia GPU. If the entire 96GB model has to be read by the GPU for each token, that will limit unquantised performance to 4 tokens&#x2F;s at best. However, as the \"Mixtral\" model under discussion is a mixture-of-experts, it doesn&#x27;t have to read the whole model for each token, so it might go faster. Perhaps still single-digit tokens&#x2F;s though, for unquantised. reply refulgentis 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is extremely misleading. source: been working in local LLMs since 10 months ago.

That means that yes you technically only need two in VRAM memory+router&#x2F;overhead per token, but you&#x27;ll have to constantly be loading in different experts unless you can fit them all, which would still be terrible for performance.So you&#x27;ll still be PCIE&#x2F;RAM speed limited unless you can fit all of the experts into memory (or get really lucky and only need two experts). reply dkarras 7 hours agorootparentprevno doesn&#x27;t work that way. experts can change per token so for interactive speeds you need all in memory unless you want to wait for model swaps between tokens. reply coolspot 15 hours agorootparentprev> $4500Which is more than a price of RTX A6000 48gb ($4k used on ebay) reply brucethemoose2 14 hours agorootparentWhich is outrageously priced, in case thats not clear.

So in theory you would need 2B for the attention head + 5B for each of two experts in RAM.That&#x27;s a total of 12B, meaning this should be able to be run on the same hardware as 13B models with some loading time between generations. reply stavros 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, but I also care about \"can I load this onto my home GPU?\" where, if I need all experts for this to run, the answer is \"no\". reply brucethemoose2 10 hours agoparentprevWe can&#x27;t infer the actual context size from the config.Mistral 7B is basically an 8K model, but was marked as a 32K one. reply seydor 16 hours agoparentprevunfortunately too big for the broader community to test.

    "originBody": "Biotech In historic decision, FDA approves a CRISPR-based medicine for treatment of sickle cell disease By Adam Feuerstein Dec. 8, 2023 Reprints Christine Kao/STAT The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the world’s first medicine based on CRISPR gene-editing technology, a groundbreaking treatment for sickle cell disease that delivers a potential cure for people born with the chronic and life-shortening blood disorder. The new medicine, called Casgevy, is made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics. Its authorization is a scientific triumph for the technology that can efficiently and precisely repair DNA mutations — ushering in a new era of genetic medicines for inherited diseases. advertisement In a clinical trial, Casgevy was shown to eliminate recurrent episodes of debilitating pain caused by sickle cell, which afflicts approximately 100,000 people in the U.S., a vast majority of whom are Black. The therapy, whose scientific name is exa-cel, is described as a potential cure because the genetic fix enabled by CRISPR is designed to last a lifetime, although confirmation will require years of follow-up. The FDA decision comes three weeks after regulators in the U.K. were the first to clear the drug. Approval in the European Union is expected next year. The FDA is also expected to rule on exa-cel as a treatment for beta thalassemia, another inherited blood disorder, by March 30. The FDA on Friday also approved another sickle cell treatment, a gene therapy from Bluebird Bio called Lyfgenia. Patients will now have the option of two cutting-edge therapies that provide potentially curative benefits. advertisement “We are celebrating,” said Lewis Hsu, chief medical officer at the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and director of the pediatric sickle cell program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “This decision has been a long time coming, pretty much since the first description of sickle cell as a genetic disease some 70 years ago.” Scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna published their first CRISPR paper just over a decade ago. In 2020, the research won the pair a Nobel Prize. Reflecting on the approval of Casgevy, Charpentier told STAT via email that she was “excited and pleased” for what it means for patients and their families. “This milestone certainly underscores the importance of fundamental research in the field of microbiology,” added Charpentier, who is also a scientific co-founder of CRISPR Therapeutics. “I am truly amazed at the speed at which CRISPR research and applications have developed to get us to this historic moment.” The biotechnology era began in the 1980s with the invention of protein-based drugs made from genetically modified animal cells. Four decades later, the arrival of the first CRISPR therapy establishes a new industry benchmark that could deliver cures for an array of inherited diseases. “Casgevy’s approval by the FDA is momentous: It is the first CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy to be approved in the U.S.,” Vertex CEO Reshma Kewalramani said. “As importantly, Casgevy is a first-in-class treatment that offers the potential of a one-time transformative therapy for eligible patients with sickle cell disease. I want to convey my deepest gratitude to the patients and investigators whose trust in this program paved the way for this landmark approval.” But for all its virtues, whether or not Casgevy, as well as Lyfgenia, becomes a widely used treatment for people living with sickle cell — undoing decades of scientific neglect and medical racism — remains an open question. Related: After living with sickle cell disease for 39 years, I’m both excited and skeptical about the newly approved gene therapies Vertex set the price of Casgevy at $2.2 million compared to $3.1 million for Bluebird’s Lyfgenia. Bluebird’s gene therapy for thalassemia, approved last year, has a list price of $2.8 million. The therapies are also not easy to receive. Patients must spend weeks, even months, in the hospital before and after the therapy is administered. And some of the preparatory steps can cause serious side effects, including severe infections, nausea, painful mouth sores, and infertility. “I think there will be immediate uptake in some portion of the patients who have more severe disease — frequent pain episodes that cause hospitalization and require opioids for the treatment of pain,” David Williams, chief of the division of hematology-oncology at Boston Children’s Hospital and an expert in treating sickle cell disease, said ahead of the anticipated approval of Casgevy. “But there could be bumps in the road,” he added, if Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics run into trouble making the complicated treatment, or if its high price tag erects barriers to reimbursement and access. “I’m skeptical that this will open the floodgates, as some people are predicting,” said Akshay Sharma, a physician who treats children with sickle cell at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Casgevy has the potential to be a “transformative therapy,” Sharma added, but “I would expect physicians and patients to be nervous and hesitant” until its long-term efficacy and safety are better defined. Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for the production of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. The mutation causes red blood cells to become misshapen. Under a microscope, they look like crescents or sickles, which gives the disease its name. When sickled red cells clump together, they clog blood vessels, robbing tissues of oxygen and causing bouts, or “crises,” of extreme pain, hospitalizations, organ damage, stroke, and early death. Physicians who treat people with sickle cell today prescribe a number of medicines that can reduce the frequency of pain crises, increase hemoglobin levels, or ameliorate symptoms, but none targets the underlying genetic cause of the disease. Stem cell transplants can be curative, but the procedure requires patients to have a donor with matched immune cells, which occurs infrequently. Further reading More on CRISPR sickle cell therapies How sickle cell became the first disease treated by CRISPR. Watch a short explainer on how Casgevy works. New gene therapies confront many sickle cell patients with an impossible choice. Key questions (and answers) about the CRISPR-based medicine. Sickle cell patients ask hard questions about who can access CRISPR therapies. This is what makes Casgevy different. It edits a patient’s own blood stem cells to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin — the healthy, oxygen-carrying form of the protein that is produced during fetal development but normally shuts down soon after birth. Researchers had previously identified a certain genetic mutation that causes fetal hemoglobin to persist into adulthood. When this happens to people with sickle cell, their disease is mild and outcomes are greatly improved. Casgevy uses the CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme to mimic this protective genetic mutation. It makes a cut at a specific spot in a gene called BCL11A. The edit, in turn, disables a DNA brake on the production of fetal hemoglobin. Bluebird’s gene therapy works through another route, delivering, with the help of a virus, a copy of a gene into patients’ cells that enables them to produce healthy hemoglobin. In a clinical trial, 28 out of 32 patients lived free of pain crises during the study period after receiving Lyfgenia. The clinical trial conducted by Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics that supported Casgevy’s approval enrolled 30 people with sickle cell, aged 12 to 35, who were, on average, experiencing four severe pain episodes per year and just under three hospitalizations per year. Victoria Gray, seen here in a 2019 photo, was the first person treated with Casgevy in the clinical trial of the treatment. Anthem Pictures/Sarah Cannon Research Institute via AP Within three months of receiving a single Casgevy infusion, all of the study participants began producing protective levels of fetal hemoglobin. All but one of the participants achieved the main goal of the study — freedom from severe pain episodes for at least one year following treatment. Twenty-eight participants remained free of pain episodes for an average of 22 months. The first person treated with Casgevy in the clinical trial, a woman named Victoria Gray, has now gone more than four years without a severe pain episode. The FDA recently held a meeting with outside experts about Casgevy, which focused on “off-target” editing — that is, any potential inadvertent changes the medicine may make in patients’ cells — underscoring how scientists and regulators are adapting to this new class of genetic medicines. On Friday, the FDA said the treatment’s label will include a caution about the “potential” risk of off-target edits. “Genome editing is something special and it may redefine the paradigm of medicine over the next 30-40 years,” said CRISPR Therapeutics CEO Samarth Kulkarni. “Exa-cel’s approval represents the start of it. “We can fundamentally alter the genes that cause disease to create a functional, lifelong solution with a single administration. That’s a new paradigm, and it’s only powered by genome editing.” CRISPR Therapeutics was founded in 2013 soon after Charpentier and Doudna published their seminal CRISPR paper. Work on what is now Casgevy started in earnest two years later, with Vertex on board as a partner and investor. The first clinical trial involving patients with sickle cell began in 2019. Casgevy is often described as a one-time treatment, but that convenience underrepresents the arduous and lengthy steps required before it’s administered. Patients first have their blood stem cells removed through a process called apheresis; the cells are then shipped off to a company-run manufacturing lab where they are edited. While cells are prepared, patients must undergo a preparatory treatment with a chemotherapy drug to remove any native stem cells that might remain in their bone marrow. This “conditioning” step is crucial because it provides space in the bone marrow for the functional, CRISPR-edited cells to engraft and grow. But the chemotherapy drug used, called busulfan, wipes out germ-fighting immune cells and can cause serious side effects, including infertility — a particularly troublesome risk factor for people who wish to have children. The actual injection of Casgevy is quick, but patients must remain in the hospital for weeks until their immune system recovers and the risk of serious infection abates. Vertex estimates about 25,000 people in the U.S. and Europe might be good candidates for Casgevy — consisting mostly of people with more severe disease who are willing to undergo the arduous procedure and accept the risks. “The initial patients will be motivated because they’ve been following, they’re interested, and they believe the benefits outweigh the risks and the current challenges,” said David Altshuler, Vertex’s chief scientific officer. “But I think the other thing that will happen is a sort of community aspect, where patients will be watching other patients in their care centers and in their community. Over time, that will build confidence and trust.” Both regulators in the U.K. and the FDA approved Casgevy for people as young as 12. “We’ve heard consistently from physicians that they are interested in treating patients who are younger,” said Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex’s chief operating officer. “The disease has taken hold less, and so these patients have fewer complications and more of a lifetime of benefit to gain. And they tend to be able to schedule this procedure into their life a bit easier than a working adult. They also tend to do really well versus older people.” Sharma, the sickle cell expert at St. Jude’s, intends to take a more cautious approach. “As long as we don’t have evidence of long-term safety, I would be hesitant to expose young children to this therapy, which is still so novel,” he said. “I think the ideal patient is an adult who has severe disease not controlled by currently available treatments.” Hsu, the University of Illinois physician, has already started speaking to his patients about undergoing treatment with Casgevy. Patients with more severe sickle cell disease “who have seen how bad it can be, especially as they grow older” are likely to be the first to seek out treatment, he said. He’s also counseled some adolescent patients who expressed initial interest in Casgevy but have since decided to wait because the medicines they take today to control their disease are working. “These are younger people whose organs are in good enough shape that they could go through this, and their disease severity is high enough that they would be eligible.” Vertex, which is running point on Casgevy’s commercial launch, has said previously that it expects a slow uptake, given the complexity of treatment and the need to sort out reimbursement and access. Lyfgenia’s approval came with a black box warning about the possibility that patients who receive the therapy might later develop blood cancer and should be monitored for that risk. Two patients in trials of the drug died of blood cancers, and studies concluded that the cancers were caused by the chemotherapy conditioning regimen for the treatment, not Lyfgenia itself.

You will always need some chemo to destroy the defective blood-making stem cells before replacing them with the genetically-modified blood-making stem cells, and any chemo that is strong enough to kill all of the blood-making stem cells in your body is necessarily going to have a risk of damaging healthy cells and turning them into pre-cancer cells.

So across the combined set of carriers and those with the full disease, the life expectancy in Malaria stricken areas tends to be higher.Pattern of change of the prevalence of the trait correlating with changes in prevalence of Malaria has been observed many places.

Grow the electroporated stem cells in antibiotic-containing nutrient media. Only cells with the plasmid (and thus antibiotic resistance) survive.* Expand and freeze the genetically modified cells.* Administer chemotherapy to the patient to eliminate defective bone marrow stem cells.* Inject the modified stem cells back into the patient, where they repopulate the bone marrow with the CRISPR edits, aiming to correct the genetic mutation.This process isn&#x27;t new but one of the biggest challenges is propagating genetic modifications to all effected cells in the body. This is why it&#x27;s much easier to GMO an egg &#x2F; sperm because once the change is made there, it&#x27;s replicated in every new cell thereafter.Other techniques utilize harmless viruses to transfect genetic modifications to the body, but this has other trade-offs. mRNA vaccines don&#x27;t propagate to every cell, but the cells which do successfully transcribe the mRNA are able to generate enough of the target protein that the body can recognize it and develop an immunity to it.

There was a previous cure for hepatitis C before the first antiviral-based cure 2013, and the initial treatment regiment for the antiviral based regimen was a hybrid of the two, before they settled on a fully antiviral-based treatment.The reason that the antivirals came down in price so quickly was because so many nearly-identical ones came on the market within a couple of years. That&#x27;s due to the discovery of a particular protein and corresponding class of inhibitors some years earlier, which was not patented, opening the door for a flood of drugs which are all functionally identical in purpose and mechanism of action, but chemically distinct and eligible for separate patent protections.That came at a time when political and other pressures made some private insurers more willing to approve treatment (usually after a few rounds of denials and appeals) - but again, with an emphasis on some, because there are large classes of people for whom it is difficult or impossible to get treated for HCV today. (They&#x27;re just not the ones likely to comment on HN).Contrast to this treatment, which is for a congenital condition that does not have the same political pressure to address, and for which a significant financial barrier to access is not merely the costs of the drug, but the cost of the associated care (chemotherapy, etc.) which is not included in the quoted price.

Let&#x27;s suppose that we had a \"health oracle\" (or something not too far off) to predict medical issues in individuals. How would you structure health insurance in that case? reply soulbadguy 13 hours agorootparentIf we had a health oracle, what would be the point of health insurance ? I think with a 100% health oracle, health inssurance will become more like group buys for negotiating better prices with health providers. reply lotsofpulp 13 hours agorootparentThat is why the industry term for health insurers in the US is “managed care organizations” (MCOs).When you (or your employer) buys a policy from UNH, Elevance, Cigna, CVS, Humana, etc, part of what they pay for is access to the MCOs pricing services. And vetting services to minimize errors&#x2F;fraud (a process which itself is ridden with errors&#x2F;fraud). reply lotsofpulp 13 hours agorootparentprevIf it was just that (in the US), then there would be no need to prevent insurers from pricing based on health of the insured. Or legislating a 3x cap on premiums between highest and lowest premium. Or legislating out of pocket maximums.The premiums are very explicitly a subsidy from young to old, which I view as a tax by a different name.

The age rating factor itself is pretty self explanatory.Instead of charging a sicker or older person $10,000 per month and healthier or younger people $100 per month because that is close to the expected loss in the calendar year for the insurer, they are mandated to charge younger&#x2F;healthier people $1,000 per month so the older person can only be charged $3,000 per month.Imagine a similar law for motor vehicles. The car insurance companies can only charge the worst and riskiest drivers 3x what the safest driver pays. Basically, you can keep getting into collisions and at some point your premium will stop increasing. Where will the money to pay for all the damages come?> I think you are assuming that insurers have perfect risk assessments power and thus regulating them should be unnecessary.I do not assume this. Insurance and tax&#x2F;wealth redistribution is a spectrum. reply eszed 12 hours agorootparentYes, if you strictly view it from a short time horizon. If you think of it as an individual&#x27;s risk over their whole lifetime, then it looks a lot better. A young person is \"paying it forward\" now, in exchange for having their own expensive treatments covered once they are old. This is the bargain that any social security or old-age pension system strikes.The trouble is, as social cohesion breaks down, and demographic cliffs approach, people lose faith that long-term programs will still be there for them as they age. Perceptual time horizons shrink, and the arguments that you have made begin to resonate.I don&#x27;t have a good answer for either of those problems. Immigration solves the demographic cliff, but appears to threaten social cohesion. We can get into tedious and repetitious arguments about why that is, but let&#x27;s please not? reply soulbadguy 13 hours agorootparentprevHere what i am understanding of the point you are making :When we offer a service to a group of person, and somehow mandate a flat price for that service. The people using the service less are subsidizing the cost for the people who use the service less.? reply lotsofpulp 13 hours agorootparentYes, although I think you meant to type> The people using the service less are subsidizing the cost for the people who use the service more.?Also, it is not a flat price, it is a capped price.As an aside, think about how the optics would have been if the politicians were transparent that a significant portion of the tax liability to pay for the healthcare would be levied based on age.Then think about older, rich people taking advantage of this and retiring early (between age 50 to 65), and because they can afford to have very low income (but a lot of assets), they qualify for even more subsidies during their most expensive years to insure, without negatively affecting their lifestyle.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthcare.gov&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;premium-tax-credit reply BurningFrog 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat we in the US call \"health insurance\" is today very different from the textbook definition of insurance. reply lotsofpulp 13 hours agorootparentI don’t think any developed country in the world has an alternative “health insurance” model. I believe Switzerland and Germany require people to purchase health insurance and it is not priced based on health risk.Health risks in general are very predictable and very high, especially as one ages. reply ajross 13 hours agorootparentprev> the collective probability of rare, but expensive health issues is basically 100%Not really, no. Most people will die of something expensive, but not $2M expensive. A quick google says that per-capita lifetime health care expediture is ~$300k. reply lotsofpulp 12 hours agorootparentIf you are referencing thishttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1361028&#x2F;That data is from the late 1990s, before the Affordable Care Act greatly expanded access to healthcare, and many new treatment options have become available since then.What I meant, though, is that across a big population’s entire lifetime, there will be a ton of high healthcare cost events. And with technological progress, new treatments will always be coming out. Which is a great thing, just not what is typically thought of as an “insurable risk”. reply ajross 12 hours agorootparent> What I meant, though, is that across a big population’s entire lifetime, there will be a ton of high healthcare cost events. And with technological progress, new treatments will always be coming out. Which is a great thing, just not what is typically thought of as an “insurable risk”.Sorry, how does that follow? Insurance works any time you have a function with predictable average but high variance. Is the total health care expenditure across a relevant subscriber base in 2023 very close to 2022? Then you can make insurance work. It&#x27;s just math. reply lotsofpulp 12 hours agorootparentInsurable risk as in charging someone an appropriate premium that is based on their specific expected loss. Property and casualty, term life, etc.Non insurable risk as in charging someone a premium unrelated to their specific expected loss (which is what health “insurance” is). reply ajross 12 hours agorootparentHow exactly are health insurance premiums \"unrelated\" to care outflows (what you&#x27;re calling \"expected loss\")? Are you saying that health insurers books don&#x27;t balance and that they&#x27;re losing money (they aren&#x27;t) or making too much profit (not unless they&#x27;re criminally hiding it)?What you&#x27;re saying doesn&#x27;t make sense. There&#x27;s no difference between health insurance and any other insurance in the way it works. You collect reliable and regular premiums from everyone, pay out unreliable&#x2F;bursty (but statistically very predictable in aggregate!) losses as contracted, and pocket the remainder as profit. And it works.Really, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about here. Health insurance is \"expensive\" in the US, sure. But it&#x27;s not failing. reply lotsofpulp 11 hours agorootparentI meant the premium for a specific person is not related to their expected loss.For example, if you carelessly drive and get into car collisions where you are at fault, your premiums go up, because your expected loss goes up.In health “insurance”, it does not matter what you do, because your premiums are not based on your expected health costs. Hence it is more akin to a tax (or subsidy). reply ajross 10 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re really not understanding this. That&#x27;s got nothing to do with the insurance model. That&#x27;s just a regulatory thing. All those choices do is change the specific population that gets insured in a single pool, such that their specific computed premiums are different. But for ANY such population, the total premiums paid == the total loss outflow + a reasonable profit. And you can tell that&#x27;s true because the accounting for those companies appears in their SEC filings.In practice, car insurers are allowed to partition their customers this way because it&#x27;s felt to be \"fair\" and because it encourages safe driving. Trying to partition health insurance customers like that feels \"unfair\", and has minimal net benefit as health expenses aren&#x27;t as controllable-by-the-subscriber as car accidents are. So we pass laws about how the partitioning gets done.But again, \"insurance\" as a business model (and mathematical model) works EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. The only difference is how you draw the lines around who gets insured at what rate. reply lotsofpulp 9 hours agorootparent> All those choices do is change the specific population that gets insured in a single pool, such that their specific computed premiums are different.

Evolution doesn&#x27;t care if you get Alzheimer&#x27;s at 70 but it still has a fairly large burden on our modern day society.Sickle cell is particularly interesting because the gene that causes it makes the carriers less susceptible to malaria.

Certain known values of None are converted to JSON null, known boolean values are converted, and, in some cases, additional semantic context fields are added. To access the raw, pre-processed JSON, use the -r cli option or the raw=True function parameter in parse() when using jc as a python library. Schemas for each parser can be found at the documentation link beside each Parser below. Release notes can be found here. Why Would Anyone Do This!?

This allows you to skip lines at the beginning and/or end of the STDIN input you would like jc to convert. START and STOP can be positive or negative integers or blank and allow you to specify how many lines to skip and how many lines to process. Positive and blank slices are the most memory efficient. Any negative integers in the slice will use more memory. For example, to skip the first and last line of the following text, you could express the slice in a couple ways: $ cat table.txt ### We want to skip this header ### col1 col2 foo 1 bar 2 ### We want to skip this footer ### $ cat table.txtjc 1:-1 --asciitable [{\"col1\":\"foo\",\"col2\":\"1\"},{\"col1\":\"bar\",\"col2\":\"2\"}] $ cat table.txtjc 1:4 --asciitable [{\"col1\":\"foo\",\"col2\":\"1\"},{\"col1\":\"bar\",\"col2\":\"2\"}] In this example 1:-1 and 1:4 line slices provide the same output. When using positive integers the index location of STOP is non-inclusive. Positive slices count from the first line of the input toward the end starting at 0 as the first line. Negative slices count from the last line toward the beginning starting at -1 as the last line. This is also the way Python's slicing feature works. Here is a breakdown of line slice options: Slice Notation Input Lines Processed START:STOP lines START through STOP - 1 START: lines START through the rest of the output :STOP lines from the beginning through STOP - 1 -START:STOP START lines from the end through STOP - 1 START:-STOP lines START through STOP lines from the end -START:-STOP START lines from the end through STOP lines from the end -START: START lines from the end through the rest of the output :-STOP lines from the beginning through STOP lines from the end : all lines Exit Codes Any fatal errors within jc will generate an exit code of 100, otherwise the exit code will be 0. When using the \"magic\" syntax (e.g. jc ifconfig eth0), jc will store the exit code of the program being parsed and add it to the jc exit code. This way it is easier to determine if an error was from the parsed program or jc. Consider the following examples using ifconfig: ifconfig exit code jc exit code Combined exit code Interpretation 0 0 0 No errors 1 0 1 Error in ifconfig 0 100 100 Error in jc 1 100 101 Error in both ifconfig and jc When using the \"magic\" syntax you can also retrieve the exit code of the called program by using the --meta-out or -M option. This will append a _jc_meta object to the output that will include the magic command information, including the exit code. Here is an example with ping: $ jc --meta-out -p ping -c2 192.168.1.252 { \"destination_ip\": \"192.168.1.252\", \"data_bytes\": 56, \"pattern\": null, \"destination\": \"192.168.1.252\", \"packets_transmitted\": 2, \"packets_received\": 0, \"packet_loss_percent\": 100.0, \"duplicates\": 0, \"responses\": [ { \"type\": \"timeout\", \"icmp_seq\": 0, \"duplicate\": false } ], \"_jc_meta\": { \"parser\": \"ping\", \"timestamp\": 1661357115.27949, \"magic_command\": [ \"ping\", \"-c2\", \"192.168.1.252\" ], \"magic_command_exit\": 2 } } $ echo $? 2 Setting Custom Colors via Environment Variable You can specify custom colors via the JC_COLORS environment variable. The JC_COLORS environment variable takes four comma separated string values in the following format: JC_COLORS=,,, Where colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, gray, brightblack, brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow, brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan, white, or default For example, to set to the default colors: JC_COLORS=blue,brightblack,magenta,green or JC_COLORS=default,default,default,default Disable Colors via Environment Variable You can set the NO_COLOR environment variable to any value to disable color output in jc. Note that using the -C option to force color output will override both the NO_COLOR environment variable and the -m option. Streaming Parsers Most parsers load all of the data from STDIN, parse it, then output the entire JSON document serially. There are some streaming parsers (e.g. ls-s and ping-s) that immediately start processing and outputting the data line-by-line as JSON Lines (aka NDJSON) while it is being received from STDIN. This can significantly reduce the amount of memory required to parse large amounts of command output (e.g. ls -lR /) and can sometimes process the data more quickly. Streaming parsers have slightly different behavior than standard parsers as outlined below. Note: Streaming parsers cannot be used with the \"magic\" syntax Ignoring Errors You may want to ignore parsing errors when using streaming parsers since these may be used in long-lived processing pipelines and errors can break the pipe. To ignore parsing errors, use the -qq cli option or the ignore_exceptions=True argument with the parse() function. This will add a _jc_meta object to the JSON output with a success attribute. If success is true, then there were no issues parsing the line. If success is false, then a parsing issue was found and error and line fields will be added to include a short error description and the contents of the unparsable line, respectively: Successfully parsed line with -qq option: { \"command_data\": \"data\", \"_jc_meta\": { \"success\": true } } Unsuccessfully parsed line with -qq option: { \"_jc_meta\": { \"success\": false, \"error\": \"error message\", \"line\": \"original line data\" } } Unbuffering Output Most operating systems will buffer output that is being piped from process to process. The buffer is usually around 4KB. When viewing the output in the terminal the OS buffer is not engaged so output is immediately displayed on the screen. When piping multiple processes together, though, it may seem as if the output is hanging when the input data is very slow (e.g. ping): $ ping 1.1.1.1jc --ping-sjqThis is because the OS engages the 4KB buffer between jc and jq in this example. To display the data on the terminal in realtime, you can disable the buffer with the -u (unbuffer) cli option: $ ping 1.1.1.1jc --ping-s -ujq {\"type\":\"reply\",\"pattern\":null,\"timestamp\":null,\"bytes\":\"64\",\"respons...} {\"type\":\"reply\",\"pattern\":null,\"timestamp\":null,\"bytes\":\"64\",\"respons...} ... Note: Unbuffered output can be slower for large data streams. Using Streaming Parsers as Python Modules Streaming parsers accept any iterable object and return an iterable object allowing lazy processing of the data. The input data should iterate on lines of string data. Examples of good input data are sys.stdin or str.splitlines(). To use the returned iterable object in your code, simply loop through it or use the next() builtin function: import jc result = jc.parse('ls_s', ls_command_output.splitlines()) for item in result: print(item[\"filename\"]) Parser Plugins Parser plugins may be placed in a jc/jcparsers folder in your local \"App data directory\": Linux/unix: $HOME/.local/share/jc/jcparsers macOS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/jc/jcparsers Windows: $LOCALAPPDATA\\jc\\jc\\jcparsers Parser plugins are standard python module files. Use the jc/parsers/foo.py or jc/parsers/foo_s.py (streaming) parser as a template and simply place a .py file in the jcparsers subfolder. Any dependencies can be placed in the jc folder above jcparsers and can be imported in the parser code. Parser plugin filenames must be valid python module names and therefore must start with a letter and consist entirely of alphanumerics and underscores. Local plugins may override default parsers. Note: The application data directory follows the XDG Base Directory Specification Caveats Locale For best results set the locale environment variables to C or en_US.UTF-8 by modifying the LC_ALL variable: $ LC_ALL=C datejc --date You can also set the locale variables individually: $ export LANG=C $ export LC_NUMERIC=C On some older systems UTF-8 output will be downgraded to ASCII with \\\\u escape sequences if the C locale does not support UTF-8 encoding. Timezones Some parsers have calculated epoch timestamp fields added to the output. Unless a timestamp field name has a _utc suffix it is considered naive. (i.e. based on the local timezone of the system the jc parser was run on). If a UTC timezone can be detected in the text of the command output, the timestamp will be timezone aware and have a _utc suffix on the key name. (e.g. epoch_utc) No other timezones are supported for aware timestamps. Use In Other Shells jc can be used in most any shell. Some modern shells have JSON deserialization and filtering capabilities built-in which makes using jc even more convenient. For example, the following is possible in NGS (Next Generation Shell): myvar = ``jc dig www.google.com``[0].answer[0].data This runs jc, parses the output JSON, and assigs the resulting data structure to a variable in a single line of code. For more examples of how to use jc in other shells, see this wiki page. Compatibility Some parsers like dig, xml, csv, etc. will work on any platform. Other parsers that convert platform-specific output will generate a warning message if they are run on an unsupported platform. To see all parser information, including compatibility, run jc -ap. You may still use a parser on an unsupported platform - for example, you may want to parse a file with linux lsof output on a macOS or Windows laptop. In that case you can suppress the warning message with the -q cli option or the quiet=True function parameter in parse(): macOS: cat lsof.outjc -q --lsof or Windows: type lsof.outjc -q --lsof Tested on: Centos 7.7 Ubuntu 18.04 Ubuntu 20.04 Fedora32 macOS 10.11.6 macOS 10.14.6 NixOS FreeBSD12 Windows 10 Windows 2016 Server Windows 2019 Server Contributions Feel free to add/improve code or parsers! You can use the jc/parsers/foo.py or jc/parsers/foo_s.py (streaming) parsers as a template and submit your parser with a pull request. Please see the Contributing Guidelines for more information.

So instead of just passing through structured data, you effectively pass around opaque objects that allow you to go back to earlier pipeline stages, and invoke methods, if I understand correctly: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;powershell&#x2F;module&#x2F;microsof....I&#x27;m rather fond of wrappers like jc and libxo, and experimental shells like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nushell.sh&#x2F;. These still focus on passing data, not objects with executable methods. On some level, I find this comfortable: Structured data still feels pretty Unix-like, if that makes sense? If I want actual objects, then it&#x27;s probably time to fire up Python or Ruby.Knowing when to switch from a shell script to a full-fledged programming language is important, even if your shell is basically awesome and has good programming features. reply lukeschlather 15 hours agorootparentAre executable methods really that bad? I mean, they&#x27;re bad in some abstract sense but that seems more like an objection if we were talking about a \"safe\" language like Rust than talking about shell scripting. For a shell executable methods seem fine. If you don&#x27;t make the method executable people are just going to use eval() anyway, might as well do the more predictable thing. reply ekidd 15 hours agorootparentIt might be possible to design a good Unix shell based on objects, with the ability to \"call back into\" programs. But I haven&#x27;t seen one yet that I&#x27;d prefer over Ruby or Python.I do think objects make plenty of sense in languages like AppleScript, which essentially allowed users to script running GUI applications. And similarly, Powershell&#x27;s objects might be right for Windows.But nushell shows how far you can push \"dumb\" structured data. And it still feels \"Unix-like\", or at least \"alternate universe Unix-like.\"The other reason I&#x27;m suspicious of objects in shells is that shell pilelines are technically async coroutines operating over streams! That&#x27;s already much further into the world of Haskell or async Rust than many people realize. And so allowing \"downstream\" portions of a pipeline to call back into \"upstream\" running programs and to randomly change things introduces all kinds of potential async bugs.If you&#x27;re going to have a async coroutines operating on streams, then having immutable data is often a good choice. Traditional Unix shells do exactly this. Nushell does it, too, but it replaces plain text with structured data. reply munchbunny 14 hours agorootparentprevPowerShell is basically an interactive C# shell with language ergonomics targeting actual shell usage instead of \"you can use it as a shell\" the way Python, Ruby, etc. approach their interactive shells. However, the language and built-in utilities work best when you are passing around data as opposed to using PowerShell as if you were writing C#.It&#x27;s true, you are indeed passing around full-blown .NET runtime objects. In fact your whole shell is running inside an instance of the .NET runtime, including the ability to dynamically load .NET DLL&#x27;s and even directly invoke native API&#x27;s.It feels a bit like JS in the sense that you&#x27;re best off sticking to \"the good parts\", where you get the power of structured input&#x2F;output but you don&#x27;t end up trying to, for example, implement high performance async code, even though you technically could. reply evnp 16 hours agoparentprev> In PowerShell, structured output is the default and it seems to work very well. This is probably too far for Unix&#x2F;Linux, but a standard \"--json\" flag would go a long way to getting the same benefits.OP has a blog post[0] which describes exactly this. `jc` is described as a tool to fill this role \"in the meantime\" -- my reading is that it&#x27;s intended to serve as a stepping stone towards widespread `-j`&#x2F;`--json` support across unix tools.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kellybrazil.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;bringing-the-unix-ph... reply im3w1l 48 minutes agorootparentIf there is to be a push to add structured data to all the unix tools, I wish they would use a format that allows embedding binary data. Yes base64 is an option, but it suffers from the issue that base64(base64(base64(data))) leads to exponential overhead. reply supriyo-biswas 17 hours agoparentprevSimilarly, in SerentityOS, stuff under &#x2F;proc return JSON data rather than unstructured text files.A better, structural way in which this could be fixed is to allow data structures to be exported in ELFs and have those data structures serialized into terminal output, which can then be outputted in the preferred format of the user, such as JSON, YAML, or processed accordingly. reply nerdponx 13 hours agoparentprevWhat I find weird about Powershell is that there&#x27;s no \"fixed-width column\" parser, which is a widely used format for Unix-style CLI tools.I don&#x27;t know if NuShell has it, I haven&#x27;t tried.In any case, it&#x27;s much better for tools to output more-parseable data in the first place. Whitespace-delimited columns are fine of course, but not so much when the data can contain whitespace, as in the output from `ps`.I don&#x27;t see much reason why JSONLines (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsonlines.org&#x2F;) &#x2F; NDJSON (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndjson.org&#x2F;) can&#x27;t be a standard output format from most tools, in addition to tables.As for the reason of removal: any language that can interact with json output can use readdir(3) and stat(2).Ugh. Any language of course can do it. But that&#x27;s basically telling users that they need to reimplement ls(1) themselves if they want to use any of its output and features in scripts.I understand if the maintenance burden is too high to put it in ls(1) itself, but it&#x27;s a shame that no tool currently does this.

Not sure if things have improved but I would have expected something like JSON lines when interval is provided.Powershell and kubectl are miles ahead of libxo in useability imo reply simias 16 hours agorootparentWell I suspect that eventually you just run into hard limitations with C&#x27;s introspection facilities, or lack thereof.I like C a lot but one of the reasons I like Rust more these days is the ability to trivially implement complex serialization schemes without a ton of ad-hoc code and boilerplate. reply gigatexal 15 hours agorootparentprevfar better for applications to be unaware of a such a utility and allow something like jc to grow in support with plugins or something so as to keep the utilities simple and move the logic and burden to the wrapping utility in this case jc. reply rezonant 15 hours agoparentprev> This seems to be a great stop-gap with parsers for a LOT of different commands, but it relies on parsing text output that&#x27;s not necessarily designed to be parsedTrue, and yet it&#x27;s extremely common to parse output in bash scripts and other automations, so in a sense it&#x27;s just centralizing that effort.

I hear comments like that in code reviews and commonly when you push for specifics about the burden, there is very little reply kbknapp 18 hours agoprevReally cool idea but this gives me anxiety just thinking about how it has to be maintained. Taking into account versions, command flags changing output, etc. all seems like a nightmare to maintain to the point where I&#x27;m assuming actual usage of this will work great for a few cases but quickly lose it&#x27;s novelty beyond basic cases. Not to mention using `--` for the tool seems like a poor choice as your help&#x2F;manpage will end up being thousands of lines long because each new parser will require a new flag. reply cproctor 18 hours agoparentWould it be fair to think about this as a shim whose scope of responsibility will (hopefully) shrink over time, as command line utilities increasingly support JSON output? Once a utility commits to handling JSON export on its own, this tool can delegate to that functionality going forward. reply dan_quixote 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d also assume that a CLI resisting JSON support is likely to have a very stable interface. Maybe wishful thinking... reply pydry 16 hours agorootparentprevIt would but I can still see somebody launching this with great enthusiasm and then losing the passion to fix Yet Another Parsing Bug introduced on a new version of dig reply kbrazil 16 hours agorootparent`jc` author here. I&#x27;ve been maintaining `jc` for nearly four years now. Most of the maintenance is choosing which new parsers to include. Old parsers don&#x27;t seem to have too many problems (see the Github issues) and bugs are typically just corner cases that can be quickly addressed along with added tests. In fact there is a plugin architecture that allows users to get a quick fix so they don&#x27;t need to wait for the next release for the fix. In practice it has worked out pretty well.Most of the commands are pretty old and do not change anymore. Many parsers are not even commands but standard filetypes (YAML, CSV, XML, INI, X509 certs, JWT, etc.) and string types (IP addresses, URLs, email addresses, datetimes, etc.) which don&#x27;t change or use standard libraries to parse.Additionally, I get a lot of support from the community. Many new parsers are written and maintained by others, which spreads the load and accelerates development. reply eichin 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m sort of torn - yeah, one well-maintained \"basket\" beats having a bunch of ad-hoc output parsers all over the place, but I want direct json output because I&#x27;m doing something complicated and don&#x27;t want parsing to add to the problem. (I suppose the right way to get comfortable with using this is to just make sure to submit PRs with additional test cases for everything I want to use it with, since I&#x27;d have to write those tests anyway...) reply majkinetor 16 hours agoparentprevThis requires collaboration. People submitting parsing info for the tool they need, and people that use it to easily keep it up to date. That is the only way. reply verdverm 18 hours agoparentprevThis is one of the better use cases for LLMs, which have shown good capability at turning unstructured text into structured objects reply ninkendo 18 hours agorootparentIf LLM’s were local and cheap, sure. They’re just too heavyweight of a tool to use for simple CLI output manipulation today. I don’t want to send everything to the cloud (and pay a fee), and even if it was a local LLM, I don’t want it to eat all my RAM and battery to do simple text manipulation.In 20 years, assuming some semblance of moore’s law still holds for storage&#x2F;RAM&#x2F;gpu, I’m right there with you. reply d3nj4l 17 hours agorootparentOn my M1 Pro&#x2F;16GB RAM mac I get decently fast, fully local LLMs which are good enough to do this sort of thing. I use them in scripts all the time.

Lowers the development cost and runtime performance, in theory reply hnlmorg 17 hours agorootparentYou don’t have to write dozens of parsers. I didn’t. reply verdverm 17 hours agorootparentPart of the appeal is that people who don&#x27;t know how to program or write parsers can use an LLM to solve their unstructured -> structured problem reply hnlmorg 17 hours agorootparentSure. But we weren’t talking about non-programmers maintaining software. reply verdverm 15 hours agorootparent> people who don&#x27;t know how to program OR write parsersthere are plenty of programmers who do not know how to write lexers, parsers, and grammars reply hnlmorg 15 hours agorootparentWe are chatting about maintaining a software project written in a software programming language. Not some theoretical strawman argument youve just dreamt up because others have rightly pointed out that you don’t need a LLM to parse the output of a 20KB command line program.As I said before, I maintain a project like this. I also happen to work for a company that specialises in the use of generative AI. So I’m well aware of the power of LLMs as well as the problems of this very specific domain. The ideas you’ve expressed here are, at best, optimistic.by the time you’ve solved all the little quirks of ML you’ll have likely invested far more time on your LLM then you would have if you’d just written a simple parser and, ironically, needed someone far more specialised to write the LLM than your average developer.This simply isn’t a problem that needs a LLM chucked at it.You don’t even need to write lexers and grammars to parse 99% of application output. Again, I know this because I’ve written such software. reply tovej 16 hours agorootparentprevthis is a terrible idea, I can&#x27;t think of a less efficient method with worse correctness guarantees. What invariants does the LLM enforce? How do you make sure it always does the right thing? How do you debug it when it fails? What kind of error messages will you get? How will it react to bad inputs, will it detect them (unlikely), will it hallicinate an interpretation (most likely)This is not a serious suggestion reply verdverm 16 hours agorootparentI used to focus on the potential pitfalls and be overly negative. I&#x27;ve come to see that these tradeoffs are situational. After using them myself, I can definitely see upsides that outweigh the downsidesDevelopers make mistakes too, so there are no guarantees either way. Each of your questions can be asked of handwritten code too reply smrq 15 hours agorootparentYou can ask those questions, but you won&#x27;t get the same answers.It&#x27;s not a question of \"is the output always correct\". Nothing is so binary in the real world. A well hand-maintained solution will trend further towards correctness as bugs are caught, reported, fixed, regression tested, etc.Conversely, you could parse an IP address by rolling 4d256 and praying. It, too, will sometimes be correct and sometimes be incorrect. Does that make it an equally valid solution? replyhiminlomax 18 hours agorootparentprevProblem: some crusty old tty command has dodgy output.Solution: throw a high end GPU with 24GB RAM and a million dollar of training at it.Yeah, great solution. reply verdverm 18 hours agorootparentWith fine-tuning, you can get really good results on specific tasks that can run on regular cpu&#x2F;mem. I&#x27;d suggest looking into the distillation research, where large model expertise can be transferred to much smaller models.Also, an LLM trained to be good at this task has many more applications than just turning command output into structured data. It&#x27;s actually one of the most compelling business use cases for LLMs reply anonymous_sorry 17 hours agorootparentThe complaint is less whether it would work, and more a question of taste. Obviously taste can be a personal thing. My opinions are my own and not those of the BBC, etc.You have a small C program that processes this data in memory, and dumps it to stdout in tabular text format.Rather than simplify by stripping out the problematic bit (the text output), you suggest adding a large, cutting-edge, hard to inspect and verify piece of technology that transforms that text through uncountable floating point operations back into differently-formatted UTF8.It might even work consistently (without you ever having 100% confidence it won&#x27;t hallucinate at precisely the wrong moment).You can certainly see it being justified for one-off tasks that aren&#x27;t worth automating.But to shove such byzantine inefficiency and complexity into an engineered system (rather than just modify the original program to give the format you want) offends my engineering sensibilities.Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old! reply verdverm 16 hours agorootparentIf you can modify the original program, then that is by far the best way to go. More often than not, you cannot change the program, and in relation to the broader applicability, most unstructured content is not produced by programs. reply Too 3 hours agorootparent> More often than not, you cannot change the programI’d challenge that. Try working with your upstream. It’s easier than ever nowadays to submit issues and PRs on GitHub.Building layers upon layers, just work around minor issues in a tool is not wise. reply anonymous_sorry 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, makes sense. Although this was originally a post about output of common command-line tools. Some of these are built on C libraries that you can just use directly.

Which is cool and everything, but has created an open source ecosystem of rugged individualism where the proceeds to the winners so vastly exceeds the crumbs left over for workers that there is no ecosystem to speak of, just exploitation. Reflected now in the wider economy.But curated open source solutions like jc approach problems at the systems level so that the contributions of an individual become available to society in a way that might be called \"getting real work done\". Because they prevent that unnecessary effort being repeated 1000 or 1 million times by others. Which feels alien in our current task-focussed reality where most developers never really escape maintenance minutia.So I&#x27;m all in favor of this inversion from \"me\" to \"we\". I also feel that open source is the tech analog of socialism. We just have it exactly backwards right now, that everyone has the freedom to contribute, but only a select few reap the rewards of those contributions.We can imagine what a better system might look like, as it would start with UBI. And we can start to think about delivering software resources by rail instead of the labor of countless individual developer \"truck drivers\". Some low-hanging fruit might be: maybe we need distributions that provide everything and the kitchen sink, then we run our software and a compiler strips out the unused code, rather than relying on luck to decide what we need before we&#x27;ve started like with Arch or Nix. We could explore demand-side economics, where humans no longer install software, but dependencies are met internally on the fly, so no more include paths or headers to babysit (how early programming languages worked before C++ imposed headers onto us). We could use declarative programming more instead of brittle imperative (hard coded) techniques. We could filter data through stateless self-contained code modules communicating via FIFO streams like Unix executables. We could use more #nocode approaches borrowed from FileMaker, MS Access and Airtable (or something like it). We could write software from least-privileges, asking the user for permission to access files or the networks outside the module&#x27;s memory space, and then curate known-good permissions policies instead of reinventing the wheel for every single program. We could (will) write test-driven software where we design the spec as a series of tests and then AI writes the business logic until all of the tests pass.There&#x27;s a lot here to unpack here and a wealth of experience available from older developers. But I sympathize with the cognitive dissonance, as that&#x27;s how I feel every single day witnessing the frantic yak shaving of \"modern\" programming while having to suppress my desire to use these other proven techniques. Because there&#x27;s simply no time to do so under the current status quo where FAANG has quite literally all of the trillions of dollars as the winners, so decides best practices while the open source community subsists on scraps in their parent&#x27;s basement hoping to make rent someday. reply abound 17 hours agoprevNushell [1] ends up at mostly the same place (structured data from shell commands) with a different approach, mostly just being a shell itself.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nushell.sh&#x2F; reply saghm 14 hours agoparentI had glanced at nunshell every now and then since it was initially announced, but it wasn&#x27;t until a month or two before that I finally really \"got\" the point of it. I was trying to write a script to look through all of the files in a directory matching a certain pattern and pruning them to get rid of ones with modified timestamps within 10 minutes of each other. I remembered that nushell was supposed to be good for things like this, and after playing around with it for a minute, it finally \"clicked\" and now I&#x27;m hooked. Even when dealing with unstructured data, there&#x27;s a lot of power in being able to convert it even into something as a list of records (sort of like structs) and process it from there. reply danyx23 10 hours agoparentprevNushell actually pairs really well with JC, given that nushell has a \"from json\" operation.

While the output of things like the LSI&#x2F;Broadcom StorCLI &#x27;suffix the command with J&#x27; approach and some of PowerShell&#x27;s COM-hiding wrappers (which are depressingly common) is technically JSON, the end result is so mindbogglingly complex-slash-useless, that you&#x27;re quickly forced to revert to &#x27;OK, just run some regexes on the plain-text output&#x27; kludges anyway.Having said that, I&#x27;ll definitely check this out.

Programs accept command line parameters and environment variables as input, but all they output for their calling program is an integer exit code. It&#x27;s not like exit(II) has an argv and an argc. GUI programs that call command line programs thus tend to be nearly blind to what the called program did. You can&#x27;t treat command line programs as subroutines.I know why it worked that way in Research Unix for the PDP-11.

Shell scripting is therefore kind of like building third party browser extensions. You look and you guess, and then you hack some parser up based on your guess, and hope for the best.I actually wish there was just a third standard output for machine readable content, which your terminal doesn’t print by default. When you pipe, this output is what gets piped (unless you redirect), it’s expected to be jsonl, and the man page is expected to specify a contract. Then stdout can be for humans, and while you can parse it, you know what you’re doing is fragile.Of course, that’s totally backwards incompatible, and as long as we’re unrealistically reinventing CLIs from the foundations to modernize them, I have a long list of changes I’d make. reply chongli 15 hours agorootparentI really want to agree because it seems to make so much sense in theory. It gets rid of the need to parse by standardizing on syntax. But it doesn&#x27;t solve everything, so we still don&#x27;t get to live the dream. Namely, it does not solve the issue of schemas, versioning, and migration.And this is a really big issue that threatens to derail the whole project. If my script runs a pipeline `abc` and utility b gets updated with a breaking change to the schema, it breaks the entire script. Now I&#x27;ve got to go deep into the weeds to figure out what happened, and the breakage might not be visible in the human-readable output. So to debug I&#x27;ll have to pass the flag to each tool to get it to print all the json to stdout, and then sit there eyeballing the json to figure out how the schema changed and what I need to do to fix my script.Seems like a big mess to me. Unless there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing? reply kbrazil 9 hours agorootparentThere could be a major schema change that breaks the contract, but one of the nice things about JSON output is that it allows the creation of new fields without affecting downstream consumers.That is, if I have a CLI program that spits out a list of IP addresses and one day I want to also output the corresponding dns names, I can simply add the \"dns\" field and existing pipelines will ignore the field and work just fine.This is better than grep&#x2F;awking&#x2F;etc. unstructured text to STDOUT because, depending on how the author decides to add the new field, it can easily break existing pipelines that rely on the shape of the data to stay the same. reply Izkata 13 hours agorootparentprev> I actually wish there was just a third standard output for machine readable content, which your terminal doesn’t print by default.

It really grinds my gears that people came up with fairly decent ideas half a century ago, and a large amount of people decided to take that as gospel rather than as something to improve on.And it&#x27;s like pulling teeth to get any improvement, because the moment somebody like Lennart tries to get rid of decades of old cruft, drama erupts.And even JSON is still not quite there. JSON is an okay-ish idea, but to do this properly what we need is a format that can expose things like datatypes. More like PowerShell.

Fun fact: filesystems by default only guarantee the integrity of the filesystem&#x27;s structure itself. The promise is that after power loss, the basic structures of the filesystem won&#x27;t be corrupt, but makes no big claims of reliability about the data written. Blocks of random junk in your data, blocks of NULLs, even parts of other files (maybe deleted data) are all things I&#x27;ve seen happen.Databases and the like take serious effort to ensure safety, but that greatly slows down performance. So it&#x27;s kind of a hard sell for a log system that&#x27;s not supposed to be a performance impact.For this contingency, you can do log shipping, but in general, system logs shouldn&#x27;t be expected to be reliable in the face of a crash, since to my knowledge all normal daemons (including rsyslogd) buffer data before flushing to disk.> You can forget just mounting a drive and checking its journald logs -- your machine has to be started by systemd in order to read journald logs!No, it doesn&#x27;t.

    "originBody": "Verizon screwup — Verizon fell for fake “search warrant,” gave victim’s phone data to stalker Verizon tricked by fake cop, fake search warrant despite obvious warning signs. Jon Brodkin - 12/8/2023, 9:44 PM Enlarge / A Verizon logo at GSMA Mobile World Congress 2019 on February 26, 2019 in Barcelona, Spain. Getty ImagesDavid Ramos reader comments 51 Verizon Wireless gave a female victim's address and phone logs to an alleged stalker who pretended to be a police officer, according to an affidavit filed by an FBI special agent. The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court yesterday. Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before arriving, sent a threatening message that said, \"if I can't have you no one can.\" He also allegedly threatened to send nude photos of the victim to her family members. Glauner was charged yesterday with stalking and fraud \"in connection with obtaining confidential phone records\" in US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. We aren't posting or linking directly to the court record because it seems to contain the victim's home address. The incident was previously reported by 404 Media. Glauner and the victim met in August or September 2023 on xhamster.com, a porn website with dating features, and \"had an online romantic relationship,\" the affidavit said. The victim ended the relationship, but Glauner \"continued to contact or try to contact\" her, the document said. Glauner tricked Verizon into providing sensitive information by sending an email and fake search warrant to vsat.cct@one.verizon.com, the email address for the Verizon Security Assistance Team (VSAT), which handles legal requests. Verizon didn't realize the request was fraudulent even though it came from a Proton Mail address rather than from a police department or other governmental agency, according to the affidavit filed yesterday by FBI Special Agent Michael Neylon. Advertisement Fake cop, forged judge’s signature An email to Verizon from \"steven1966c@proton.me\" on September 26, 2023, said, \"Here is the pdf file for search warrant. We are in need if the [sic] this cell phone data as soon as possible to locate and apprehend this suspect. We also need the full name of this Verizon subscriber and the new phone number that has been assigned to her. Thank you.\" The email's attached document contained a fake affidavit written by \"Detective Steven Cooper\" of the Cary, North Carolina Police Department. The Cary Police Department confirmed that no officer named Steven Cooper is employed by their agency, Neylon wrote. VSAT received a phone call the same day from a man identifying himself as Cooper, who stated that he needed information on a suspect in a homicide case. \"The caller stated that the person involved changed her phone number,\" Neylon wrote. The fake affidavit asked for the new phone number as well as \"call records both outgoing and incoming\" and \"locations and text messages incoming and outgoing.\" The affidavit for a search warrant was supposedly approved by Superior Court Judge Gale Adams. Adams is a real judge and she later confirmed to authorities \"that the signature displayed on the document was not hers,\" Neylon wrote. Neylon's affidavit also said the \"search warrant\" was \"not in the proper format and does not have form AOC-CR-119, as required for State of North Carolina search warrants.\" Verizon provides address and phone logs But after reviewing the email and document sent by \"Cooper,\" Verizon provided an address and phone logs. \"On October 5, 2023, Verizon Wireless provided Victim 1's phone records, including address and phone logs, to Glauner,\" according to Neylon's affidavit. Verizon's website says that the Verizon Security Assistance Team ensures that \"court orders, search warrants, subpoenas and other legal demands served upon Verizon are processed confidentially and in compliance with all applicable law.\" \"Verizon Security Assistance Team will only accept valid legal demands (subpoena, court order or search warrant) for records,\" the VSAT webpage says. We contacted Verizon about the incident today and will update this article if we get a response. A Verizon spokesperson told 404 Media that the company is cooperating with law enforcement on this matter.

There is no way Verizon or anyone else knows if there is a specific form used in one of the 1700+ counties that comprise the US. Federal subpoenae are even easier because they are uniform and are filed under seal. Verizon can&#x27;t call the Clerk&#x27;s office and ask, \"did the grand jury really issue a subpoena?\" The documents are written on simple copy paper and lack any kind of security features. Expect more of these as word gets out. Also, it&#x27;s easy enough to file a small claims case and have a subpoena issued. Usually, there&#x27;s no one to quash the subpoena. Civil subpoenas take a little longer than criminal ones and you have to pay to have them served, but so what? reply usrbinbash 2 hours agoparent> The documents are written on simple copy paper and lack any kind of security features.Wait, sorry, sorry, sorry, hold up, full stop...could you repeat that again?These orders arrive AS GODDAMN PAPER PRINTOUTS?!?Am I to understand that official orders that instruct telco providers to provide the private communication data of people, are transmitted as smushes of pigment on thin pieces of wood-paste, instead of a digitally signed file that the recipient can trivially verify with the ordering entities public key? reply wruza 2 minutes agorootparentIt’s amusing how much HN expects from “the outer world”.Companies can adopt new tech in 1-2 years. Industries have around 5-10 years inertia. Bureaucracies like courts still live in the past millenia. You should be happy that they are using email.The best security measure they will implement after this article going wide is something like “only emails from @ are valid, but we’ll destroy you anyway in case a judge mistakenly sends you an order from his own gmail”. reply eqvinox 2 hours agorootparentprev> Am I to understand that official orders that instruct telco providers to provide the private communication data of people, are transmitted as smushes of pigment on thin pieces of wood-paste,Yes.

(GDPR violations might be a secondary charge, but wiretapping would be way more significant.)That said it really depends on the exact legal framework (which I have no clue about) and eagerness of a prosecutor to make a case. Hence my \"maybe\".FWIW I have a side job at a small community ISP in the EU and the GDPR was a no-op for us. The requirements for anyone operating in the telco space were already stricter. If I remember correctly the GDPR fines are higher though, whereas wiretapping (& co.) laws are much more likely to land you personally in jail.(I was being intentionally vague with \"privacy laws\"; I do include wiretapping charges in that but, again, I don&#x27;t know the US legal situation.) reply saati 1 hour agorootparentprevThe perp is an individual, GDPR only applies for organizations. reply eqvinox 32 minutes agorootparentWe&#x27;re talking about Verizon&#x27;s liability here, not the stalker. replyhn_throwaway_99 5 hours agoparentprev> Forging a judicial order is trivial.That&#x27;s like saying forging a plea from a Nigerian prince is trivial. Verizon should be deeply embarrassed by this - I mean the initial request came from a proton account with misspellings and grammar mistakes of a child.I don&#x27;t know how Verizon does it, but I have a friend who works in the \"respond-to-law-enforcement department\" at one of the FAANGs. Given the company, they get tons of legal requests for info, but also tons of fraudulent ones, not to mention ones from real governmental organizations but that are dubious that they challenge. Point being they have extremely detailed processes and technology to respond to these requests. Verizon is the biggest cell phone company in the US, they can afford to not look like a total clown show in this regard. reply MichaelRo 4 hours agorootparent>> with misspellings and grammar mistakes of a childYou realize we&#x27;re talking about impersonating a police officer here, right?

If your defense against phishing relies on your adversary not knowing what a legitimate request looks like - it&#x27;s not a very good defense. reply hn_throwaway_99 2 hours agorootparentTwo points:\"Normal\" phishing is a bad example, because many phishing emails notoriously use misspellings and bad grammar on purpose because scammers don&#x27;t want to waste their time on people with half a brain, they only want people dumb enough to respond in spite of the ludicrous misspellings. But in this Verizon case, that logic doesn&#x27;t apply, because there was only a single targeted recipient.With respect to \"If your defense against phishing relies on your adversary not knowing what a legitimate request looks like - it&#x27;s not a very good defense\", I wholeheartedly agree. My point was only that the fact that Verizon responded to this fake subpoena despite the reddest of red flags makes me think that they must have horrible procedures generally for verifying these types of requests. reply chatmasta 6 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m always torn about this kind of exploit. On the one hand it&#x27;s obviously vulnerable. On the other hand, securing it would require centralization of authority. I think I&#x27;m actually okay with accepting the tradeoff of insecure verification of \"legitimacy,\" in exchange for decentralization of police power.But it&#x27;s also worth noting that the \"vulnerable\" system is not the centuries old system of policing. If you get arrested by a fake cop, that system affords you legal remedies - it might take a few days but you&#x27;ll see justice. The vulnerable system here is Verizon&#x27;s process for responding to inbound messages claiming to be search warrants. And when this system fails, the victim has effectively no remedy - their stalker already read the data that Verizon sent him.So that&#x27;s even less of a reason to increase centralization of the policing system. It won&#x27;t solve the problem because the problem is with a different system. reply smsm42 6 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a solution for this, which is relatively easy to implement, if we dare to. Recognize data privacy as a right. Enable the victim to sue the leaking party, with easy recovery and costs, for any bad subpoena accepted, and pay substantial fine for violating the rights. Very heavily substantial if it leads to subsequent other damage (such as stalking or violence). Miraculously, the data hoarders would find ways to verify subpoenas (and design protocols and pay for development of necessary tools) very quickly, I think.Of course, this would require such law to actually survive the lobbying block of the data hoarders in the first place, and that&#x27;s not likely to happen, alas. reply kevin_thibedeau 2 hours agorootparentWe need an embarrassing data leak on Congress before they will be motivated.

Including date of issuance and jurisdiction should help prevent using stale IDs to scare someone.If the subpoena is not sealed, the ID would show all the subpoena info, further narrowing down the ability to replay stale IDs.I&#x27;m definitely missing something obvious though because technical solutions are often not a panacea in cases like this reply jncfhnb 6 hours agorootparentprevSorry who do you want having the right to subpoena these records besides the government? reply chatmasta 6 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s more than one \"government,\" that&#x27;s what I mean by decentralization.

Who in the federal government is responsible for verifying that a legitimate court submitted the key?What if the head of the agency responsible for verifying these courts institutes a policy that courts will lose their verification for rulings against abortion?What if two courts in neighboring jurisdictions claim to be the same court? They each submit a different public key, but both can verify they hold the private key that pairs with the public key they submitted. How does the federal agency even verify the identity of a courthouse? Do they need to physically visit them and meet with the judge to tap a Yubikey?What if somebody steals the YubiKey from the judge? What if a referendum dissolves a jurisdiction?What is the process for revocation of verification? reply gruez 4 hours agorootparentMost of the concerns you raised are either non-issues or can be resolved a minor amount of legal legwork. Even if the system isn&#x27;t perfect and there are edge cases that it can&#x27;t handle, having any sort of key registry is better than the current system where anyone can claim to be a judge, and it&#x27;s up to some lowly corporate employee to do the verification themselves. reply Teever 3 hours agorootparentAs a non American it&#x27;s pretty comical watching Americans make mountains out of molehills for problems that are solved in other countries. reply h_r 5 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s what I was thinking...

    "originBody": "Research Paving the way to efficient architectures: StripedHyena-7B, open source models offering a glimpse into a world beyond Transformers December 8, 2023 ・ By Together One of the focus areas at Together Research is new architectures for long context, improved training, and inference performance over the Transformer architecture. Spinning out of a research program from our team and academic collaborators, with roots in signal processing-inspired sequence models, we are excited to introduce the StripedHyena models. This release includes StripedHyena-Hessian-7B (SH 7B), a base model, and StripedHyena-Nous-7B (SH-N 7B), a chat model. StripedHyena builds on the many lessons learned in the past year on designing efficient sequence modeling architectures: H3, Hyena, HyenaDNA, and Monarch Mixer. Try Now StripedHyena is the first alternative model competitive with the best open-source Transformers in short and long-context evaluations. The same base model achieves comparable performance with Llama-2, Yi and Mistral 7B on OpenLLM leaderboard tasks, outperforming on long-context summarization. StripedHyena is faster and more memory efficient for long sequence training, fine-tuning, and generation. Beside attention, one core computational primitive for efficient inference is a state-space model (SSM) layer, building on pioneering work such as S4 (Gu el al.), enabling conversion of convolutional layers into recurrences. Using our latest research on fast kernels for gated convolutions (FlashFFTConv) and on efficient Hyena inference, StripedHyena is >30%, >50%, and >100% faster in end-to-end training on sequences of length 32k, 64k and 128k respectively, compared to an optimized Transformer baseline using FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels. StripedHyena caches for autoregressive generation are >50% smaller than an equivalently-sized Transformer using grouped-query attention. StripedHyena is designed using our latest research on scaling laws of efficient architectures. In particular, StripedHyena is a hybrid of attention and gated convolutions arranged in Hyena operators. Via a compute-optimal scaling protocol, we identify several ways to improve on baseline scaling laws for Transformers (Chinchilla) at the architecture level, such as hybridization. With these techniques, we are able to obtain higher quality models than Transformers at each training compute budget, with additional benefits at inference time. StripedHyena is optimized using a set of new model grafting techniques, enabling us to change the model architecture during training. StripedHyena was obtained by grafting architectural components of Transformers and Hyena, and trained on a mix of the RedPajama dataset, augmented with longer-context data. We look forward to further pushing the boundaries of model architectures for fast training and inference, allowing us to improve on existing scaling laws and to obtain higher quality base models at each compute budget. A single architecture for short and longer context tasks For the past year, the Together AI team and our collaborators at Hazy Research have been working on the design of new sequence models for language and other domains. We’ve been especially excited by architectures that replace attention as the primary operator responsible for mixing sequences of embeddings, and replacing them with alternatives that are computationally cheaper. We’ve developed several models (H3, Hyena) that replace attention with implicit gated convolutions and gated SSMs, and trained some of the first alternative architectures rivaling Transformers on language. Evaluation We evaluate StripedHyena on a suite of benchmarks to establish performance on short-context tasks, as well as to probe its ability to process long prompts. First, we test perplexity scaling on a subset of books from Project Gutenberg. We compute the perplexity on the last 2048 tokens of each sample, and repeat the experiment by including increasingly longer prefixes in the prompt of StripedHyena. We observe different behaviors depending on the structure of the sample; perplexity either saturates at 32k (the input length seen during the last stages of training), or keeps decreasing past 32k, suggesting that the model is able to incorporate some information from the longer prompt. Context length scaling on books sampled from the Gutenberg collection. The loss decreases when the model is fed additional context via longer prompts. Quality on longer context makes StripedHyena an efficient baseline generalist model, competitive with Mistral 7B on summarization and longer context tasks: Benchmark (shot) SH 7B Mistral 7B GovReport, F1 (0) 27.9 17.5 NarrativeQA, F1 (0) 25.8 24.7 Qasper, F1 (0) 28.8 30.3 Average 27.5 24.2 Benchmarking StripedHyena-Hessian-7B (SH 7B) and Mistral 7B on zero-shot, long-context tasks from ZeroScrolls. StripedHyena is the first alternative architecture competitive with strong Transformer base models of the same size or larger, at scale. On short-context tasks, including OpenLLM leaderboard tasks, StripedHyena outperforms Llama-2 7B, Yi 7B and the strongest Transformer alternatives such as RWKV 14B: Average of standard short-context, benchmarks: `arc-challenge`, `mmlu`, `boolq`, `winogrande`, `hellaswag`, `truthfulqa`. We use the few shot configuration from the OpenLLM leaderboard. SH 7B is the first alternative model with performance comparable to the best Transformer baselines of the same size or larger. With our collaborators at Nous Research, we are excited to also release StripedHyena-Nous- 7B (SH-N 7B), a chat model, built with new fine-tuning recipes tailored to the StripedHyena architecture. Understanding the architecture design space: Many ways to improve scaling Hybridization Early in our scaling experiments, we noticed a consistent trend: given a compute budget, architectures built out of mixtures of different key layers always outperform homogenous architectures. These observations echo findings described in various papers: H3, MEGA (among others) and find even earlier connections to the hybrid global-local attention design of GPT-3 (from Sparse Transformers) and GPTNeo. To understand this phenomenon, as well as the improvement on scaling coefficients – for example, the expected loss reduction per floating point operation (FLOP) in the budget – for a class of architectures, we carried out an extensive compute-optimal scaling analysis. We found hybrids composed of multi-head attention, gated MLPs and gated convolutions to outperform strong Transformer architectures such as Llama across compute budget, and identified optimal ways to mix these components, in both ordering and quantity. [Left] Perplexity scaling of different architectures, as a function of compute budget. [Right] Optimal hybridization ratio for the compute-optimal model at each compute budget. All points in the figures above, each representing a training setting (model size, architecture, and total number of tokens) are compute-optimal. Perplexity scaling analysis. We follow a compute-optimal protocol and identify the optimal model sizes for each FLOP group (each indicated via a different color) for base and hybrid architectures. To minimize the impact of hyperparameters on different architectures, we derive hyperparameter scaling laws from a subset of optimized experiments. Hybridizing improves on both scaling and robustness to training performed outside the compute-optimal frontier. With our academic partners, we have been developing theory and synthetic tasks to understand how and why this occurs. We have identified a variety of regimes where layers specialize to particular sub-tasks of sequence modeling, providing valuable signals for further architecture optimization. This continues our general line of work on mechanistic design, which involves small-scale, synthetic tasks carefully constructed to stress-test architecture capabilities. Multi-head gated convolutions Another way to improve over Transformer rates is to introduce additional computation in the form of multiple heads in gated convolutions. This design, inspired by linear attention, has been validated in architectures such as H3 and MultiHyena, and is provably more efficient at encoding associative recall circuits. We validate a variety of architectural improvements via compute-optimal scaling. These are two of many architectural design techniques that can result in improved scaling over Transformers. With StripedHyena, we focus in particular on the synergy between attention and gated convolutions. A shift in the computational footprint of language models: Cheaper fine-tuning, faster inference Optimizing models built on a different architecture requires rethinking computational trade-offs of training, fine-tuning, and inference. For these new architectures, a different set of computational bottlenecks emerges, and we’re proud to have developed the key technologies enabling these models as well, such as FlashFFTConv and its predecessors. For training and fine-tuning workloads on long sequences, SH 7B is always faster than optimized Transformers (>10%, >20% and >50% end-to-end faster than FlashAttention v2 processing sequences of lengths 32k, 64k and 128k, at batch size 1), with the speedup growing larger on longer sequences and with larger batches. StripedHyena models are optimal candidates for fine-tuning on long-context tasks – for tasks at length 128k, SH 7B can finetune on more than twice as many tokens as a Transformer given the same budget. End-to-end batch size 1 latency of an optimized Transformer 7B (FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels) compared to SH 7B. These improvements are driven by the different asymptotic scaling and computational profile of layers in the hybrid architecture. We look forward to even faster models with refined mixing ratios and layers. Reducing memory for inference One additional advantage of SH 7B is a >50% reduced memory footprint during autoregressive generation, compared to a Transformer (both with grouped-query attention). In Transformers, the key and value entries of each layer are cached during the prefilling phase to avoid recomputation and speed up incremental decoding. Gated-convolution layers introduce significantly more degrees of freedom during inference, as there are several ways to represent and optimize computation. We explore these trade-offs in our recent research on distillation and representation of convolutions in Hyena. These new techniques have been used in SH 7B to further reduce the memory footprint by identifying and pruning redundant states. Memory footprint of inference cache for GQA Transformer and StripedHyena, including key-value cache and convolution states (FIR and IIR). From signal processing to language models The flexibility of StripedHyena is a direct consequence of the existence of multiple equivalent representations and parametrization of linear systems: convolutional, modal, canonical. Each form is better suited to a specific training and inference workload. Borrowing terminology from classical signal processing, SH convolutional filters can be broadly treated as either finite (FIR) or infinite (IIR). FIR caching for a convolution is analogous to standard key-value caching (kv caching) in attention – particularly the sliding window kind – and grows in memory footprint (until a maximum value). IIR filters on the other hand can be applied by caching a constant-size state, then updated during decoding via a recurrent step. The IIR representation can itself be customized. Fixed-size states, in contrast to kv caches, open up several key optimizations at the inference stack level, streamlining techniques such as continuous batching and speculative decoding. What’s ahead Our primary objective with the StripedHyena models is to push the frontier of architecture design beyond Transformers. StripedHyena only scratches the surface of what is possible with careful architecture design via mechanistic design and scaling laws, and with ideas such hybridization, implicit convolutions and state caching. We hope these models can inspire the open source community to explore new exciting builds with diverse architectures. In future versions we will explore: Larger models with longer context. Multi-modal support. Further performance optimizations. Integration of StripedHyena into retrieval pipelines for full utilization of longer context.

A lot of movement, but no real progress. If that plateau goes on too long, excitement (and funding) dry up and things die down.Then someone figures out how to get past the current plateau, and the whole process repeats. That could be new tech, a new architecture, or it could be old tech that was infeasible and had to wait for Moore&#x27;s Law.Right now we are on the vertical part of the sawtooth pattern. Everyone hopes this will be the time that takes us to infinity, but the old people are just waiting for people to crash into the new wall. reply fvv 11 hours agorootparentWhy things should dry up when contrary to fusion ai is already usable by millions daily ? Even if prpgress should stall a bit the product or fine-tunes or normal progress will still be super supeful , the \"too soon\" point has been surpassed reply blagie 7 hours agorootparentA lot of previous plateaus in AI are usable and used by billions daily, for example, giving good navigation routes on your phone, managing NPCs in a video game, showing ads, or recommending movies.It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t have value -- they do, and in the trillions of dollars -- but once understood, they move from \"AI\" to \"algorithms\" and stop being exciting.The current progress feels different to me, though. The current step in capability is much higher than previous ones, as is the potential disruption. reply Al-Khwarizmi 6 hours agorootparentI think what makes the current iteration of AI different is that we don&#x27;t understand how the emerging abilities work.A map navigation algorithm: we understand it, we know where the limit is (basically it cannot do anything that isn&#x27;t map navigation), so it stops being exciting.GPT: we don&#x27;t understand it, we don&#x27;t know where the limit is... And it doesn&#x27;t seem it will stop being exciting until we do. reply TheDudeMan 7 hours agorootparentprevYes. The thing that makes the current generation of AI different is that the architectures scale. Another $10 million in training effort WILL yield improvement. And Moore’s law pairs nicely with scaling behavior. In other words, there is currently no end in sight. Plus, algo advancements like this make things happen ever faster. Plus, increased VC money means more money to throw at hardware and more folks trying new things in software. Soon we’ll be replaced :( reply actionfromafar 10 hours agorootparentprevDepends on what you are looking for. I have this hesitation too. What we have and are on track for is useful and cool, but how far will we come in this spurt until we are back at slight incremental gains?Implementation wise in business, we are very early though. It feels like email in 1995, we have barely scratched the surface of what LLMs can mean for business and everyday life. reply ReptileMan 1 hour agorootparentprevBecause suddenly the tech moves from world transformative to world enhancing.

Most research and prototyping happens on the scale that is just barely out of the \"toy\" category. reply ttul 6 hours agorootparentprevQuantization means reducing the number of bits used to encode each floating point number constituting a parameter in the model So instead of having billions of possible values per weight, you might have just 255. The model has to have its weights crammed into a much smaller number of possible values, which reduces its ability to produce good outputs. reply triyambakam 5 hours agorootparentSorry, my question is, why are the 7B models so exciting? reply aseipp 3 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t require really expensive and power-hungry components to run, i.e. a mid-range GPU can run a (4-or-5-bit quantized) 7B model at +50 tokens&#x2F;second, so it&#x27;s completely feasible to run on a small budget. They are easier to fine-tune, because they are smaller, and you can even just do CPU inference if you really want. There are good OSS implementations like llama.cpp and exllama. And there is a lot of belief that 7B models are not yet tapped out in terms of efficacy, so they will keep improving. reply regularfry 6 minutes agorootparentA 7b quantised model is also about the biggest you can run on an M1 MacBook too.

    "originBody": "Darling 58 Rescue and Restoration of the American Chestnut The American chestnut was an ecologically, economically, and culturally significant tree species in the Eastern United States. In the late 1800s, the introduction of the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) from Asia decimated an estimated four billion American chestnuts. Today, this iconic species rarely reproduces in the wild and is therefore considered functionally extinct. The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) is leading an unprecedented mission to restore the American chestnut tree to its native range. By employing complementary methods of traditional breeding, biotechnology, and biocontrol, TACF is working to create a disease-resistant and genetically diverse population of American chestnuts. One of TACF’s greatest achievements is the establishment of a genetically diverse, reproducing population of thousands of American chestnut trees representing hundreds of breeding lines. These trees are planted in TACF’s expansive network of germplasm conservation orchards and regional breeding and backcross orchards. We have substantially increased blight-resistance and Phytophthora resistance in these populations. The future inclusion of transgenic and/or gene-edited trees will further increase those gains. Restoration is an incremental process which will require the integration of multiple technologies and institutions. TACF is privileged to work with a diverse range of partners, from private landowners to university research labs, who inform the direction of our scientific inquiry. This collaboration allows TACF to compare results from across the native range of the American chestnut. Through this extensive research network, transgenic methods have shown great promise for generating a blight-tolerant American chestnut tree and play an important role in TACF’s science strategy and restoration efforts. The Transgenic Darling 58 American Chestnut Tree In 2015, The American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project (TACRRP) at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) created the first line of transgenic American chestnut trees and named it after an early supporter of the project, Herb Darling. Deeming it a promising path toward American chestnut restoration, TACF began formally supporting TACRRP’s work in 2015 through significant funding and research support. The goal of the Darling line of trees was to confer blight tolerance by inserting a gene from wheat called oxalate oxidase (OxO). The OxO gene detoxifies oxalic acid produced by the chestnut blight fungus and could hypothetically prevent lethal cankers on the tree. Many “events” (random insertions of the gene into the American chestnut genome) were created using the 35s constitutive promoter which causes the OxO gene to always be “switched on” in the tree’s tissues. These different events were tested for gene placement and OxO expression and one, named Darling 58, was selected for further lab and field testing. Initial laboratory and greenhouse tests on Darling 58 trees (also known as D58) showed that high disease-tolerance was being conferred by the OxO gene. Extensive safety tests showed no significant difference in the Darling chestnut’s interactions with other organisms compared to American chestnut (read about Nutrition, Wildlife, Plants & Fungi), and the Darling 58 product was poised to play a significant role in American chestnut restoration. As a result, TACRRP submitted petitions for deregulation to USDA APHIS, EPA, and FDA with the goal that Darling tree could eventually be used in the wild to restore American chestnut populations. Based on these results and its ongoing support for biotech research, TACF extensively supported TACRRP throughout the research efforts as well as the petitions for deregulation.

WATCH DARLING 58 CHESTNUT CHAT Why TACF is No Longer Supporting Development of D58 or Deregulation of the Darling Line Throughout 2023, TACF and its partners observed disappointing performance results from broad-scale field and greenhouse tests of advanced generations of Darling trees across several geographic locations. As discussed in the September 15, 2023 episode of TACF’s Chestnut Chat webinar series (Darling 58 Update), analysis indicated striking variability in Darling trees’ blight tolerance, significant losses in growth competitiveness, and reduction in overall fitness including stunted growth, leaf browning and curling, and increased mortality. View the body of evidence about Darling’s issues on the Darling 58 Performance page. In November 2023, through molecular analyses performed by partners at the University of New England and University of Maine, TACF learned that the OxO gene of all Darling 58 trees was on a different chromosome than expected (chromosome 4 instead of chromosome 7). Upon further and additional independent investigation, scientists confirmed that the trees they had been researching were in fact descendants of a different event in the Darling line in which the OxO gene had been inserted into a coding region, causing a deletion in a known gene. That research has also indicated that the homozygous state (when an individual plant inherits the OxO gene from both parents, which occurs in 25% of offspring) is lethal, and that a majority of homozygous offspring die in the embryonic stage. TACF researchers suspect that the performance issues of Darling trees stem primarily from the placement of the OxO gene as well as the constitutive expression of the OxO gene which is always “switched on” via the 35S promoter. Somewhat like having a constant fever, that constitutive promotion appears to result in high metabolic costs for the trees. All events in the Darling line use this promoter. Therefore, TACF is no longer pursuing research efforts with any event in the Darling line. The OxO gene still shows promise as a potential method to increase blight tolerance. In collaboration with several research partners, TACF is investigating other transgenic lines that use a “wound inducible” promoter, which only switches on the OxO gene in cells where the plant is wounded. (Read more in the What’s Next section below.) It is TACF’s assessment that this suite of poor performance issues makes the Darling line unsuitable for use in American chestnut restoration populations. After reviewing and independently verifying these data, TACF has withdrawn its support for several pending regulatory petitions that would authorize distribution of Darling trees outside permitted research plots. What’s Next? The Darling transgenic line was one of many branches in TACF’s multi-pronged approach to American chestnut restoration. A diversified portfolio of research initiatives and an extensive partner network ensures that other disease-resistant prototypes, created from breeding and biotechnology methods already in the research pipeline, can be comprehensively vetted and released in a reasonable time frame. Based on lessons learned through the process of researching and testing Darling lines of trees, TACF has created the following framework to better guide future efforts. Guiding Principles for Science and Restoration Efforts: Rigorous testing for efficacy through the tree life cycle, not only in the lab and greenhouse, but also in the field prior to regulatory submission Rigorous testing for plant health and environmental risks Implementation of a tree improvement cooperative structure which can facilitate shared intellectual property, provide full transparency across all members, and ensure the rigor and comprehensiveness of scientific methodology and analysis Ensuring products remain in the genetic commons as much as is possible, while also protecting the quality and integrity of a given product (for example, through material transfer agreements) TACF continues to make gains in blight resistance with its traditional American chestnut hybrid breeding program by selecting backcross hybrid parents that combine high American chestnut ancestry with above-average blight resistance and breeding these superior parents together. TACF is working with partners to develop a rapid genotyping method that will allow researchers to more efficiently predict blight resistance and to select offspring that have better blight resistance than their parents. Insertion of the OxO gene still holds promise as a method to increase blight tolerance in American chestnut. Expressing this gene with inducible promoters, that confine expression to only blight infected tissue, has the potential to reduce the growth and survival penalties observed with constitutive promoters. ESF researchers have developed a prototype inducible OxO line that expresses the gene only in tissues that are wounded or blight infected. In addition, our collaborators at the University of Georgia are developing founders with a blight inducible OxO gene using a variety of inducible promoters to fine tune the expression of OxO. In the next few years, we will be conducting field trials and laboratory experiments to assess the performance of these inducible OxO lines. TACF is also conducting experiments to combine inducible OxO expression with additional genes for blight resistance through breeding. For several years, TACF has been breeding OxO transgenic trees with American chestnut backcross hybrids and with large surviving American chestnut parents selected for increased blight resistance. Results obtained in the coming years will show whether or not there is an additive effect of stacking OxO with resistance genes from chestnut. If it is determined that resistance in Chinese chestnut is additive with OxO, another potential pathway is to insert genes from Chinese chestnut directly into American chestnut using methods similar to OxO insertion. TACF has made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes from Chinese chestnut that may contribute to blight resistance. We are collaborating with researchers from Virginia Tech to validate whether these genes play a role in blight resistance. We remain hopeful and optimistic that restoration of the American chestnut will be achieved thanks to continued support from your membership and donotions and from our dedicated network of volunteers and research partners. Darling 58 FAQs Does TACF still support transgenics as a restoration tool? Yes. The technology itself remains safe and represents one of several branches of research TACF is investigating for American chestnut restoration. While TACF believes the Darling line to be ineffective, the trees are not unsafe for the surrounding ecology. Our concerns are that we do not want the underlying genetic issues passed on to future generations of restoration American chestnut populations. We also do not want a defective product released into the public domain. During this deregulation process, we have seen what appears to be an increase in overall public acceptance of these technologies. To bolster that trust, our organization, its scientists, and its advisors, therefore, must sometimes make difficult decisions which will ensure the safest and most effective product will be what is deployed for restoration. What has TACF learned and gained from this experience? As in all scientific endeavors, TACF has gained much from the experience with the Darling lines. Enthusiasm for this project has expanded an already large network of engaged people with a passion for the species, both within our chapters and across the range . Their efforts have conserved dozens of diverse, wild American chestnut populations, and public support for integrated solutions to forest health issues is at an all-time high. Our diversified portfolio of research initiatives and the partners implementing them ensures that other disease-resistant prototypes – those created from breeding and biotechnology methods that are already in the research pipeline – can be comprehensively vetted and released in a reasonable time frame. The following achievements, gained through the process of studying the Darling line, will continue to have a positive impact in our research and restoration programming. Creation of additional, better performing transgenic lines which can be used for research and deployment in the next few years (see What’s Next above) Ongoing expansion of research and implementation partnerships Field tests with large sample size, wide geographies, and 12-month+ direct inoculations of research trees are essential to gathering appropriate performance indicators Increased acceptance of transgenic and biotechnologies for forest health applications Greater understanding of the regulatory process and its application for forest health concerns Expanded and ongoing conservation of wild-type American chestnut germplasm. Deployment & improvement of high light methods for “speed breeding”. Increased standardization of processes between TACF and external research locations which minimize confounding variables. Why should I continue donating to TACF / continue my membership? TACF is grateful for the support of their thousands of members, donors, and volunteers. We have all embarked on this journey with an understanding that working with trees requires knowledge that will surpass our own lifetimes. As reviewed in our “Next Steps” section there is still so much work that can and should be done toward American chestnut restoration. As our panelists noted during the September 15 Chestnut Chat, restoration is a process, not a product. While everyone was very hopeful that Darling 58 would represent a large step in that process, TACF wants to ensure the remaining steps of restoration will be established upon the most competent and effective foundation. Your membership and donation dollars have allowed TACF to make the unfortunate but necessary decision regarding ongoing development of the Darling line. We hope you will continue to support the exciting ongoing and new research TACF and its partners continue to have in its pipeline. The NY Chapter promised me Darling 58 trees... what now? TACF is removing its support for development and deregulation of the Darling line of American chestnuts. These trees remain under regulatory control and will not be distributed until that control is released. What do we do with all these GCOs/wild-type American chestnut plantings? One of the greatest achievements of The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) is the establishment of a broadly diverse, sexually-reproducing population of American chestnuts containing thousands of trees and representing hundreds of breeding lines. Please continue to plant and care for these trees! Our ongoing efforts are dedicated to achieving enhanced disease-resistant American chestnuts. These wild trees and germplasm conservation orchards (GCOs) will continue to play a pivotal role in testing and research, as well as the ultimate reintroduction of a robust and diverse population back into the native range. Along with their potential outreach benefits, these plantings are vital for preserving genetic diversity, which is essential for the long-term survival and adaptation of the American chestnuts. For more detailed information on our current scientific strategies, please refer to the our Science Strategy page. Does TACF continue to support transgenic research at SUNY-ESF? TACF is privileged to work with many different partners throughout the native range of the American chestnut, all of whom inform the direction of our scientific inquiry. As TACF continues to strive to fulfill our mission, to restore the iconic American chestnut to its native range, it is imperative to include data and input from many credible sources, from the work of private landowners to university-level, ongoing projects. Because of this breadth of information, TACF has the ability to review and contrast data from comparative sites throughout the range on a scale that wouldn’t be possible without the input of our collaborators. It is through this collaborative effort and the data borne from it that the Science Team at TACF has concluded that pursuing constitutive promoters within our transgenic program, specifically 35s promoters seen in all Darling lines, is not yielding desired results and that the efforts of our staff, chapters and partners may be better directed to other methods of our multi-pronged approach to chestnut restoration. TACF has and will continue to support and partner with those creating and implementing safe and effective paths for American chestnut restoration. What do we need for successful restoration? American chestnut restoration is a much broader and more complex endeavor than developing blight-resistant varieties of trees and mass-producing them. Successful reintroduction of self-sustaining and growing populations of our target species requires a whole-ecosystem approach. This means not only tree improvement for disease resistance and competitive ability, but also identifying and targeting optimal habitats, establishment techniques, and protection from biotic and abiotic hazards during establishment. These hazards include animal predation, novel pests and diseases, climate change, habitat degradation, and anything else that is likely to stand in the way of a seed becoming a seed-bearing tree. The forests of eastern North America have changed drastically in a multitude of ways and will continue to change rapidly through this century and beyond. We will have to discover the role that disease-resistant American chestnuts will play in these new forests through a combination of predictive models and long-term in-forest performance trials. Restoration is also a socio-ecological exercise, not solely biological or technical. Just as forests have and continue to change, so has/will the relevance of the American chestnut tree to current and future generations of people who will carry this work forward. What does the future of American chestnut restoration look like? In the immediate future, American chestnut restoration will be: Ecological: forest plantings of trees that incorporate various approaches to disease resistance (BC, TG, GE, etc) in scientifically selected sites, testing various treatments to mitigate bio/abio obstacles. Monitoring for survival and growth. Social: establishing the above plantings in collaboration with diverse partners who are prepared to take chestnut restoration through the 21st century. In the longer term: Ecological: Monitoring the plantings from v.1.a for flowering, reproduction, regeneration, recruitment, and population dynamics over 1-2 decades. Also, monitoring sustained impacts on ecosystem processes – other biota, soil health, and other valued functions. Social: Continuing to partner with diverse stakeholders to whom the American chestnut will be relevant through the rest of this century and beyond. Selecting for and committing to the long haul and incremental improvement. Why did TACF find out the problems with D58 so far into the regulatory review process? Keep in mind that regulatory review is focused exclusively on safety and not efficacy (i.e. how well the tree would perform in restoration populations). The studies performed on environmental safety, as well as data regarding American chestnut spread and silviculture, continue to suggest that the researched Darling line will not constitute a plant pest risk. The producer is in charge of ensuring efficacy of their product, not the regulatory agencies. If a producer submits a faulty product to the market, the market will reject it. At TACF, we want to ensure that the product (trees destined for restoration efforts) are effective before they “hit the market”. We value greatly the trust granted to us by supporters which have allowed us to spend the past 40 years on the process, and which will take many more decades for successful restoration to be realized. The process of science leads to learning. One of the major lessons learned from this process is the need to have field test data and results, not just lab and greenhouse data, available prior to plans for deployment and release of a given product. Tree life spans and cycles necessitate longer-term timelines than those of most crop plants. Despite a perception that modern transgenic and other genetic engineering technologies are a “quick fix”, their application and testing remains subject to “tree time”. I have given money to TACF specifically for D58 research. Was my money wasted? Your donation and membership was and continues to be vital in our capacity to research transgenic technologies. That funding is what has allowed us to comprehensively review the field performance of advanced-generation Darling lines, the analysis of which has led to this unfortunate, but science-based conclusion. The beauty of science is that we learn and then apply those lessons to future work. See the ‘What have we learned’ FAQ, and the ‘What’s Next’ section above for more information about how your funding was and will continue to be used to further restoration of the American chestnut. Does this mean Darling 58 or transgenic technologies are unsafe? Not at all. Extensive ecological and other testing has demonstrated that the Darling prototype trees do not present plant pest risks different from native chestnuts. While Darling trees would not adversely affect the natural environment, TACF has concluded that these trees are unsuitable for restorationd due to their poor performance issues. Premature distribution of this or other inferior varieties may also unfairly skew public perception against biotechnology solutions to save threatened forest tree species. TACF is confident that our path will eventually yield safe and effective restoration trees. I joined TACF to get a D58 tree. Can I get a refund on my membership? The Darling tree is still pending approval by regulatory agencies. Recent findings suggest that the Darling tree is ineffective as a restoration tree, and may compromise future generations of disease-resistant American chestnut populations. As always, we encourage you to plant wild-type American chestnuts, assist with planting and research efforts of our Chapters, and to become a member of The American Chestnut Foundation to have first-access to the most advanced populations of disease-resistant material. What would you have done if these trees had already been deregulated and released to the public? TACF has two tools that allow us to track and implement quality control on trees we produce and plant. The first called the Germplasm Agreement (GPA). The GPA is a type of material transfer agreement (MTA) which is signed between TACF and someone using material from our research programs. The GPA ensures that the cooperator understands that, because the germplasm is still in a research trial, the material is not to be used for commercial purposes, and cannot be distributed beyond land which that person owns. Second, the GPA has provisions on guarantees. These research materials cannot be guaranteed for performance, and we reserve the right to recall the materials should they be found not suitable for restoration. The second tool we have is a customized, online database called dentataBase. This tool allows us to track not only the progress of our breeding and research programs, but also the locations of trees that we have distributed as part of our research programming. TACF is highly concerned with ensuring any product it distributes and deploys is both safe and effective for long-term restoration goals. Can I still get pollen from D58? Due to performance concerns, likely caused by a constitutive promoter used to express the OxO gene in the Darling transgenic American chestnut, TACF is no longer planning to incorporate any Darling transgenic American chestnutstrees in our species restoration efforts. The Darling tree also has yet to be deregulated (a step that TACF no longer endorses) and the original D58 event is at a very early stage of production. If we have to start at such an early diversification step on research and diversification of a transgenic product, we believe that our efforts would be much more efficiently placed on events with different genetic constructs. TACF looks forward to discussingfocusing on current and new alternative approaches. Has TACF contacted regulatory agencies? Yes, TACF has provided information to regulatory agencies regarding its concerns with Darling performance, as well as the organization’s new stance that these trees should remain under permitted research status.

MOU – Memorandum of Understanding – an agreement between TACF and a partner organization which documents the goals and general terms of that partnership OxO – Oxalate oxidase – The terms commonly applied to a gene which produces the enzyme oxalate oxidase, which neutralizes oxalic acid. In American chestnut restoration context, the OxO gene is one of the most promising to confer resistance to the chestnut blight fungus. PRR – Phytophthora root rot/ink disease Phytophthora cinnamomi – the scientific name for the organism which causes Phytophthora root rot Pure/purity – a commonly misconceived quality attributed to wild-type American chestnuts.

This helps uncover whether particular populations are well adapted only to their own habitats or in other habitats as well. RNAi – In the context of American chestnut restoration, this is a method whereby partial sequences of important pathogenicity genes from the chestnut blight fungus are inserted into American chestnut. The partial fungal sequences are expressed in the chestnut tree as double stranded RNA, which are then degraded by the chestnut trees through a pathway called RNA interference. The degradation of the key fugal pathogenicity genes by the host reduces the chestnut blight fungal virulence. Thus far ESF researchers have used this technology to silence chestnut blight genes involved in the production of oxalic acid, which reduces the chestnut blight fungus’s ability to kill tissues in chestnut bark.

Its damn shame it is not thriving reply joecool1029 10 hours agoparentTried to respond to this before maybe the site will let me now. There&#x27;s a redwood that was thought to be extinct that thrives in east coast conditions of the US. The dawn redwood is a fast grower, and while being the smallest of the redwood species is still quite a large tree. It was discovered in a valley in China I guess back in the 40&#x27;s, previously only known to the fossil record.We have one here planted in the 1970&#x27;s that towers over my house and had one next to my childhood home. It&#x27;s amazing they do as well as they do, but the concern now is genetic bottleneck since most of the seeds planted worldwide were from a few trees, so the successive generations I guess don&#x27;t do as well as the ones in that valley do. reply redavni 10 hours agorootparentWow fascinating. Apparently it is a deciduous tree. reply joecool1029 3 hours agorootparentIt is. Just finished dropping its leaves&#x2F;needles for the winter. I&#x27;ve heard from a few arborists they&#x27;ve had people ask if their tree needed to be cut down thinking it was dead, only to be told that&#x27;s just what it does in the fall (it drops later than most of the other trees). We couldn&#x27;t ID the one by my old house when I was a kid (internet was still early, nothing like inaturalist). Thought it was a larch, which having seen the tree now makes sense. I have been wondering after the recent HN topic if it has similar fire resistance&#x2F;recovery that the giant redwoods out west have, realize we don&#x27;t really know how long it&#x27;ll live in the here since all were brought in the past 80 years. When the landlord planted it he misjudged how big it would grow (seems to be a common theme with the ones I see growing around). Until we got cats these red squirrels would eat the seeds in the small cones it produces and chuck them at our roof.Other than the squirrel issue I have that was resolved, the tree is a lovely tree and I have had many dreams of them and memories of sitting in the shade under them with my cat as a kid.

An exploration into the internet's most simple domain names Nero Vanbiervliet Dec 8, 2023 3 Share this post x.com is Twitter, but what are [a-z].com? nerology.substack.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 1 Share Being bored on a train ride, I typed into the browser of my phone: a.com ⏎. Elon started using x.com for Twitter in July this year, and I was wondering who was behind other domains such as a.com, b.com, etc. Sadly, a.com turned up blank: a.com does not resolve, as well as 23 other .com domains And so did b.com, c.com, d.com, e.com, f.com, g.com, h.com, i.com, j.com, k.com, l.com, m.com, n.com, o.com, p.com, r.com, s.com, t.com, u.com, v.com, w.com and y.com. All blank. If you are good at pattern recognition, you might have noticed that three domains are missing from the list above! x.com, and two others: q.com q.com is the first domain that actually works, and it's owned by Quantum Fiber, selling fiber internet connections in the US. z.com z.com currently has no clear purpose. According to the message on the page, the domain has recently changed hands as part of an acquisition by Max Bullions Limited (Hong Kong based) for 1.7M HKD (220k USD). This seems weird as the domain was sold in 2014 for 6.8M USD, which would be around 8.9M USD today taking inflation into account. Why is there no [a-z] \\ [qxy].com? Shortly after establishing “.com”, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority withdrew the possibility to purchase single letter domains. Existing domains such as x.com were allowed to stay. I couldn’t find the motivation behind this, but I’m guessing to prevent something like domain squatting? For example, you could make googl.e.com as a subdomain of e.com. A non-careful user could mistake that easily for google.com. However, other top level domains were less strict about this. Wikipedia has an extensive list of existing single letter domain names. Let’s quickly run through .org, .net and .co, and look at what’s behind these domains their [a-z]. Exploring [a-z].org .org is a busy domain, so a quick summary to kick it off: Grey does not resolve, blue = for sale, green = active, red = active but broken. Here’s a screenshot of every active domain: a.org shows a log in prompt! A recent discussion on /r/hacking does not reveal the password however… c.org redirects to change.org. Neat. e.org is a British energy supplier. The logo frighteningly resembles that of Enron Corporation, which also dealt in energy. It’s hard to pinpoint the purpose of f.org. The terms of service and privacy policy made me chuckle though. g.org definitely has the most intriguing visual. Seems to be the same owners as f.org (similar website structure & terms). There’s a login form on the top right. i.org is owned by Meta, but seems to be broken. q.org is a web3 company. u.org is owned by Understood, an NGO that supports “people with learning and thinking differences, like dyslexia and ADHD” - see their mission statement. v.org is owned by The V Foundation, it has “one goal in mind: to achieve Victory Over Cancer®.” No clue what the ® is doing there, but I hate cancer too. WordPress has w.org! I can’t believe I had to go all the way down to x.org to find a piece of software history. Apparently the organisation almost lost this icon domain in 2016, but since they still have it, I assume that has been resolved by now. y.org is owned by YMCA (here’s the YouTube link to the song if you feel like dancing). What about [a-z].co? .co also has a lot going on: Grey does not resolve, blue is for sale (a lot!), green is active, red is in use but broken. Two active ones are used as link shorteners: t.co (Twitter) and g.co (Google). The remaining active domains (green) are owned by companies: a.co (Amazon), b.co (BESTSELLER), h.co (BESTSELLER), m.co (Volvo), o.co (Beyond) and s.co (Snapchat). This is the broken domain: y.co is owned by a Monaco based yacht chartering company. Their twitter (nitter) has more content than the sad landing page above. And [a-z].net? Only two domains resolve for this TLD. i.net is for sale, but q.net is cool: I’m clearly too young to know Desmond Llewelyn show on q.net, but he is an actor that played “Q” in the James Bond franchise. I am a little bit disappointed Honestly I expected a lot more from these domains. My gut feeling is that they are super valuable, and I expected all of them to be either in the hands of some ancient software/internet organisation, like x.org leading brands today, like x.com jokes that got out of hand or funky stuff, like q.net In practice, 13 out of 22 existing domains on .co are for sale. Others like y.co and i.org exist, but give an error upon loading. I think that’s a waste. On the bright side, if you want to get your hands on a [a-z].co, there’s plenty of availability! But if you end up buying one, please do something cool with it. P.S. If you quickly want to check [a-z] of a different domain, such as `.de` if you live in Germany, you can use this tiny python script. P.S.2 About numbers: 1.co and 1.org exist, but 1.com and 1.net don’t.

The amount of stupid ideas that have turned out to be wildly successful. reply BitwiseFool 17 hours agorootparentprevI prefer the term \"Domain Scalper\". As it so happens, domain squatting is a legal term and it refers to buying the domain of a registered trademark just to sell it to the owner of the trademark. It doesn&#x27;t even have a good resolution rate either. reply ak_111 21 hours agoparentprevI think there are some 3 letter domain available on most TLD including .ai, I wonder why these haven&#x27;t been taken up yet? reply indianets 20 hours agorootparentBecause of exorbitant price set by the registry.

And, rest was messed up by the new TLDs.I strongly believe if there was original gTLDs and ccTLDs, internet would be a better place. reply Gigachad 11 hours agorootparentThis sounds like a good thing though. The high price makes squatting unviable so domains are left unregistered and available for someone who will actually use them.All the new TLDs removed scarcity from the system which didn’t provide any value. reply geraldhh 20 hours agorootparentprevnew-age tld&#x27;s don&#x27;t count reply schwartzworld 15 hours agorootparentI have a .world tld, and it&#x27;s not unusual for email inputs to wrongly mis-validate my perfectly valid email. reply Gigachad 11 hours agorootparentSeems like these issues come from the tlds longer than 3 chars.I have a .red and a .me and never had an email field fail to validate. reply tjpnz 22 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;re people&#x27;s initials. reply mrweasel 22 hours agoprevOne letter domains has the same issue as many of the gTLDs, they aren&#x27;t particularly useful in terms of brand recognition. X.com is pretty stupid as well, you can&#x27;t meaningfully use it as a brand.Take bob.builders, it&#x27;s a perfectly valid domain, but if you see it on the back of a van, even if it&#x27;s www.bob.builders, it&#x27;s not recognizably as a website. www.b.com has the exact same problem, even x.com &#x2F; www.x.com is just weird and looks like a mistake. The one letter domains have the added issue that you have no association that might indicate where the domain will take you. reply extheat 21 hours agoparentNo, I disagree with the idea that one letter domains look wrong. Especially with the many new TLDs, more often than not short URL services use single character domains. Take g.co for example—google uses that in ads everywhere. It’s modern equivalent of calling a short code phone number unrecognizable. But yet most people still instinctively know how to text them for information. However for really esoteric TLDs, I can see why it would be more of a problem, not because the length of the domain, but that the TLD, like .jobs, just doesn’t sound right. reply swozey 20 hours agorootparentWhen I see a t.co (x.co now?) link I have literally no idea where it&#x27;s going to take me at all and I am far, far less likely to click one of them knowing that it&#x27;s a url shortener. This is such a common thing that there are browser extensions&#x2F;slack(discord&#x2F;teams&#x2F;etc) options to unfurl urls. reply kalaksi 19 hours agorootparentExactly. I think it also teaches people to trust all kinds of obscure domains instead of trusting only well known ones. It might be even easier to write the little bit longer domain as you don&#x27;t have to double check correct spelling. Browser will likely fill it in anyway. I just don&#x27;t see any real benefit. reply rany_ 20 hours agorootparentprevLooks like x.co has a minimum asking price of 1 million USD. I wonder who this offer is directed towards ;)See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.co reply swozey 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s actually surprisingly cheap. I used to be at a 4 letter .com and we paid over $1mil for it in 2015 back when domains were still worth something. reply sublinear 21 hours agoparentprev> X.com is pretty stupid as well, you can&#x27;t meaningfully use it as a brand.Just \"x\" alone isn&#x27;t really the brand.It&#x27;s more like \"x.com\" is the canonical name.From that perspective, \"x\" or \"x.com\" is about as good as brand recognition can get.

I don&#x27;t think most business owners would want this as their brand, but I guess Elon is special in this way as well. reply da_chicken 19 hours agorootparentElon is special in a lot of ways.Twitter had one of the strongest brands. Not in social media, not in technology, just one of the strongest brands period. Do people realize how rare and difficult that is to do? That little blue bird was everywhere. Elon just gave it up. Flushed it away.Kind of like those advertising contracts. reply kaba0 19 hours agorootparentIt is indeed his biggest mismanagement, but it’s a serious competition.At least it broke the image of ‘CEOs must be intelligent’, that was wide spread in certain circles. reply FredPret 18 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s smart?Maybe he did it for the lol&#x27;s, or to own his political opponents, or maybe it was just a mistake he locked himself into. All of which sound just like him.Rockets don&#x27;t fly and electric cars don&#x27;t drive if they aren&#x27;t built right, which puts a floor on the IQ of the man who is that involved and hands-on with it. Being early in a major startup is a big deal, never mind a whole string of them.He may or may not be weird or an asshole but he sure ain&#x27;t stupid.EDIT: I&#x27;ve been on the fence about this guy ever since I read his most recent biography, but it&#x27;s really hilarious how saying something even remotely positive about him brings out an crowd who is enraged at his very being and the notion that such a thing as competence might exist. reply unaindz 17 hours agorootparentIf he did it for the lols of for \"owning the libs\" he would have told us way back then.He did it because he thinks the x looks cool, SpaceX, Tesla model X, even his son is called X. He just didn&#x27;t realized or didn&#x27;t care that it would kill the amazing brand it had before. That, just after making the mistake of overpaying for twitter while trying to fool around with a buy he didn&#x27;t even want to make, makes him not very smart.If that doesn&#x27;t convince you lots of his proposals for innovative tech are bs. From single line underground tunnels for cars instead of just using more efficient trains, designing a stupid submarine to rescue the kids trapped in the Tham Luang cave as a PR stunt and then calling a pedophile the expert diver who called him out on it. There is probably more. I mean he doesn&#x27;t even understand the costs of running a page as big as wikipedia so I wouldn&#x27;t want him near my rockets if I worked for spaceX. reply fluoridation 17 hours agorootparentprev>for the lol&#x27;sWell, the previous owners of Twitter are laughing with him, all the way to the bank.>to own his political opponentsI don&#x27;t see how throwing away a brand does that.>maybe it was just a mistake he locked himself intoAgain, I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible. What he locked himself into was buying Twitter at a stupid price. After he did that he could have simply kept Twitter as it was, which was what he paid for. If he was just going to remake Twitter into something completely different there was no need to buy it at all. He could have just built X from the start. You could argue that what he bought was Twitter&#x27;s userbase, but that userbase exists because Twitter is the way it is, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that it&#x27;ll stick around once Musk finishes turning Twitter into X. reply kaba0 17 hours agorootparentprev> Rockets don&#x27;t fly and electric cars don&#x27;t drive if they aren&#x27;t built right, which puts a floor on the IQ of the man who is that involved and hands-on with itAgree! So what does it have to do with Musk?Also, I really wouldn’t call someone smart who literally forced himself into buying a company out of ego for much more than its worth. I wouldn’t call someone smart who did that with a car or whatever, let alone that amount of money. Then firing all the people without realizing that won’t fly that easily in Europe. Then all the bullshit he tried to do around the takeover (lines of code, having twitter explained to him, etc) - like I thought he is at least okay at being a web developer given paypal.. but nope, also a fraud there.He is at the very least just a dumb narcissistic lucky guy who got dealt a good hand of cards, at worst is actively malicious. reply FredPret 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s wild that you think he had no positive input with any of his successful technical startups.Have you considered that x.com might have been an impulse buy (at the market rate, I might add).

You have great insight into his \"actual\" capabilities, as well as his \"actual engineering knowledge and experience\", not to mention his sleep schedule.- Do you think there&#x27;s no value in technical leadership?- Why do you think progress can be made by many correct decisions at the detailed level made by many engineers, but not by a few correct decisions at the high level made by an engineering leader?- Do you honestly, honestly believe the only thing he contributed to was the rear-view mirror because that&#x27;s his only patent?(by the way, that&#x27;s exactly the kind of joke that he would love)- Has it occurred to you that he did not file a patent application for every single thing he did?- Or that he certainly had a directing influence in almost every aspect of those cars?- Or that his main contribution is creating the business and factory system that makes the cars?There&#x27;s a lot to criticize about this man, and all other people who do things on a big scale, but it really looks like 99.9% of the criticism is just mindless, directionless hate. reply kaba0 12 hours agorootparent> Do you think there&#x27;s no value in technical leadershipThere is.

Only through literally buying the “founder” title of a company that wasn’t even started by him.Now you claim that he had a directing influence on almost every aspect - may I ask you where you get this information from?I think his smallest problem is just being a conman selling this self-made billionaire image, while not being particularly bright in the first place. The real problem is his push for right wing propaganda (presumably for lower taxes) on twitter, but even previously, or licking putin’s ass, etc. These are another kind of moral failing, on which I can happily judge him on. replyantifa 9 hours agorootparentprev> brings out an crowd who is enragedcan&#x27;t think of a less fanboyish way to describe mild disagreement by 3 random commenters. reply dingnuts 17 hours agorootparentprevnot that I&#x27;m exactly hopeful or that I think this indicates wisdom in Elon&#x27;s move, or that he will be successful, but it -would- be good to have a social media site that isn&#x27;t advertising supported, so that the users aren&#x27;t the product.

    "originLink": "https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-in-paper",
    "originBody": "December 8, 2023 iA Writer in Paper ‹ Previous 3 minutes READ Next › This holiday season, we’re excited to introduce the newest addition to the iA family: iAノートブック, the Notebook for Writers. Watermark lines guide your pen. As your words come into focus, the lines fade into the background. The iA Notebook has been a labor of love, spanning several years of trials and fails and deeply engaging our designer team. Get a sneak peek of the iA Notebook this holiday season. If iA Writer Was a Notebook It all began with a simple question: What if iA Writer took the form of a physical notebook? Ten years in the making, we doubled our efforts in times of exponentially growing artificial text. In the iA Notebook, every element is crafted to minimize distractions and enhance the joy of writing, mirroring the philosophy of iA Writer. Our goal was to extend the immersive focus experience enjoyed on our app to the offline realm. iAノートブック, made with love in Japan Functionality was a key consideration in our design process. We carefully selected the paper thickness and color; the binding method was chosen to ensure the books lay flat, for an unbothered writing experience. The concept of transparency also influenced the design: you will find it in the subtle watermarking on the band and the transparent wrapping paper. Fading Watermark Guidelines We wanted guidelines in the notebook, serving as a temporary scaffold to support your writing without causing distraction. The design had to reflect the core spirit of iA Writer: simple, clean, uncluttered. The use of ink had to be exclusively reserved for the owner’s handwritten text. After exploring different approaches, the decision to adopt delicate watermark guidelines became clear, even though its implementation demands high technical expertise and attention to detail. “It’s impossible” Watermark lines. They are noticeable when holding the paper against the light. After ten iterations, the Swiss paper makers and bookbinders stopped answering our emails. “We have to try harder” Making waterlines work required a lot of testing and optimization. We went through over 100 prototypes and 20 test prints with our binder in Japan. Before: When the light comes from above they are barely just noticeable. Ideal for guiding the pen. After: As your words come into focus, the lines fade into the background. The lines are here: On an empty page the lines are visible. This needed just the right amount of ink and the right line thickness, and the right paper. Design takes time. The lines fade: The stronger contrast between ink and paper make the lines fade. It’s noticeable but less striking on a photograph, since the camera doesn’t act exactly like the human eye. These watermark guidelines are subtle and unobtrusive, offering direction without overpowering the page. The high contrast between the discreet guidelines and the ink from your pen creates an optical illusion: the lines seem to vanish gradually as you write. Once your thoughts have taken shape on the page, the lines fade into the background, allowing your text to take center stage. It’s an optical illusion, based on the way our eyes work. We focus on the highest contrast. Since the ink is stronger than the watermark lines, the watermarks appear to be invisible. Everything is made out of paper. (Okay we did use a mesh and some glue, too). Logo on the backside: It’s not about us. Japanese Craftsmanship Extraordinaire Bringing this small project to life required a printing company with dedication, attention to detail, and a deep commitment to their craft. In the cultural context of Japanese companies, patience and continual improvement until reaching a high standard are highly valued. Our bookbinding partner, located in Tokyo not far from our office, was chosen for the excellence of their past work and their genuine interest in product design. What sets them apart is not just their role as a supplier but as a true partner, actively contributing ideas to enhance the collaborative process. Want? Well… Following numerous prototypes and years of continuous collaboration, we take great pride in the final result we can share with you today. A first batch as a Christmas gift for friends and family is underway. As a little gesture for Christmas this year, we’ve set aside three prototypes to be gifted to lucky raffle participants. Sign-ups are open until December 25th, and the winners will be revealed on January 15th. Oh, and we have three additional surprises coming in this year’s iA Winterfest so head over there to join the raffle and get hints of what else is waiting under the tree. If you’d like one, send us a signal. We need to simplify the production and figure out the logistics. The price depends a bit on how much interest we get. Simply sign up to our iA Notebook newsletter or join the raffle to show your interest. We’ll send out a preorder, early next year.",

One of the few pieces of software to genuinely change my professional and artistic life.I screamed for a second when I thought this was them releasing an eink device. Something like Remarkable, that would be a day one buy for me.I tried to get this hacked together with one of those Chinese Android eink tablets, but the save&#x2F;sync was unreliable (only time I’ve ever lost writing) and the overall experience was poor compared to my iPad. But my soul pants for iA Writer on eink. reply sambeau 14 hours agoparentThe only thing stopping me from using iA Writer for everything is being able to manually sort a folder. I realise that, being it&#x27;s just a folder underneath, this would require storage somewhere. But it could be as simple as: _index.md: - File 1.md - File 2.md - File 3.md reply brailsafe 13 hours agorootparentSince it&#x27;s a mac app, it could store the metadata in either a file, like you mentioned, or in a userdefaults preference dictionary (plist) that would be stored in the app&#x27;s library support folder, or they could use core data and just keep a unique identifier for the path to the folder reply fluder 8 hours agorootparentprevDid you try FSNotes?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsnot.es reply bradgessler 8 hours agorootparentprevI want it to have basic Frontmatter “dimming”, which ByWord does well. reply disqard 13 hours agoparentprevThank you for that enthusiastic appraisal!You made me wonder \"is it really that good?\", so I just tried it out and loved it, and I&#x27;m grateful to you for bringing it to my attention.Have a wonderful day, Internet stranger :) reply andrei_says_ 4 hours agoparentprevIA writer is just one of these “human-centric-design” things.I’ve owned it since the early versions, a one-time purchase, consistently updated through the years. Its way to embrace ai-generated text is to mark it as such at insertion time and to invite you to rewrite it.As for the printed notebook version, I’m buying it. reply Caddickbrown 16 hours agoparentprevHave you tried something like Obsidian? How would you compare it? reply bayindirh 13 hours agorootparentI use both, and won’t exchange one for the other. Obsidian is a knowledge management tool. iA is on the other hand is a writing tool. I compose my blog posts there, esp. its writing aids are very helpful.While obsidian is getting more and more of my knowledge, all focused post authoring is happening and will happen in iA. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentprevFor me, they&#x27;re so different that it&#x27;s hard to compare them. Obsidian is a great tool for linking, searching, querying, and visualizing sets of thoughts. It happens to have a text editor, but that&#x27;s not the brilliant part about it. Obsidian&#x27;s editor feels to me like a method to get data into the note database. Also, Electron.iA Writer is a one the best text editors I&#x27;ve ever touched. It happens to have tools for linking and searching notes, but that&#x27;s not the brilliant part. Writer&#x27;s data management feels to me like methods to navigate around to the note I want to writing. Also, it&#x27;s a \"Mac-assed Mac app\", looks and feels exactly like it belongs on my desktop, plays nicely with all other Mac apps, and couldn&#x27;t be faster or more responsive if it were hand-coded in assembler.If I want to store and search notes, I&#x27;d probably pick Obsidian (although I&#x27;m currently using Bear Notes for that). If I want the best writing environment I know of, I&#x27;ll reach for iA Writer every time. reply samsolomon 14 hours agorootparentprevNot who you asked, but I like and own both, but have found myself moving to Obsidian more and more. I&#x27;m not entirely sure why. IA writer now has document linking and I love the typography. I like the editor better.I think there is something that makes file organization easier in Obsidian. I have a plugin that creates a new note for each given week. And it feels easier to navigate a bunch of files without the descriptions&#x2F;first few lines of the doc.EDIT: And this thread has encouraged me to second guess myself about some of these things and there&#x27;s a setting to remove descriptions in the library. Maybe I&#x27;ll try picking IA Writer back up! reply crossroadsguy 9 hours agorootparentprevObsidian is fantastic except that it’s not a native app (nor is Zoplin). I have made peace with web&#x2F;electron apps by now except for very intimate affairs like note taking. I don’t know why I still can’t bring myself to use such electron&#x2F;web mobile&#x2F;desktop apps to write longer or even short notes&#x2F;texts. reply seeknotfind 16 hours agoparentprevI love it too :) so many good memories writing, staring at that perfect blue cursor blinking. The markdown renderer is beautiful too because it still renders a lot of the special characters. Header hashtags off to the left. reply llm_nerd 15 hours agoparentprevOne thing I battled with in iA Writer is its objection to adverbs and adjectives. Eventually I came to appreciate its position, realizing that they add little value to text. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentAh, I hate that you were downvoted for that. For those who haven&#x27;t used it, yes, iA Writer tries to steer you away from adverbs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia.net&#x2F;writer&#x2F;support&#x2F;basics&#x2F;writing-tips&#x2F;parts-of-s...You can turn that off. I did at first; all the colors in the English prose I was writing distracted me. I came to appreciate that, though. I realized that I used adverbs and adjectives much more than I intended to, and now they stand out.Along those lines, I&#x27;ve also realized that I overuse \"great\", \"love\", \"hope\", \"literally\", and \"but\". I added those to iA Writer&#x27;s custom patterns, and now it pesters me when I use those words. Sometimes I mean to, but I literally love to put them in every sentence and hope it turns out great. iA Writer says, hey, you might want to reconsider your word choices. reply Filligree 15 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like it’s not very useful for fiction, then? reply turuttituff2000 14 hours agorootparentMark Twain: “When you catch an adjective, kill it.” Stephen King: “The road to hell is paved with adverbs”.But what do they know about fiction? :) reply crossroadsguy 9 hours agorootparentStephen King once said, “Ms Rowling seems to have never met one [adverbs] she didn&#x27;t like\"But what would Rowling know about storytelling :)I have never even read Rowling, nor have I read King. But such restrictions and imposing of so called “rules”, or what is good what is not, are absurd when comes art. I would urge anyone to not let such decrees by the famous to dictate their style, let alone a software. reply turuttituff2000 6 hours agorootparentWhatever rocks your art. Being especially careful with adverbs and adjectives is common practice among experienced writers. More examples:“Adjectives are frequently the greatest enemy of the substantive.” – Voltaire“[I was taught] to distrust adjectives as I would later learn to distrust certain people in certain situations.” – Ernest Hemingway“The adjective is the banana peel of the parts of speech.” – Clifton Paul Fadiman“[The adjective] is the one part of speech first seized upon and worked to death by novices and inferior writers.” – J.I. Rodale“Use no superfluous word, no adjective, which does not reveal something.” – Ezra Pound“The adjective has not been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight place.” – E.B. White“[Whoever writes in English] is struggling against vagueness, against obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective.” – George Orwell“Most adjectives are also unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think that the concept is already in the noun.” – William Zissner reply llm_nerd 14 hours agorootparentprevObviously you can turn that syntax highlighting off. Add that the majority of writing is non-fiction (I&#x27;d wager 99.99%+ of written words). Or least purported to be non-fiction. reply themadturk 12 hours agorootparentprevThe killing of excess adjectives and adverbs is very good for fiction. reply RBerenguel 14 hours agoparentprevShilling (or not, it’s open source, who cares). I made this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rberenguel&#x2F;PiWriteIt is not iA Writer in eink, but I got distant inspiration (I used it a lot back when it was released… a long time ago) and could be closer with effort. reply crossroadsguy 9 hours agorootparentOnly an external keyboard works? Also how does it survive Amazon’s device update etc? This looks very interesting though! reply RBerenguel 37 minutes agorootparentI guess I could make the on-screen keyboard work with a text area instead of needing an external one, but I never planned on using that, I find “glass keyboards” annoying to use. It would require some serious changes to the system though, since everything is designed for reading input from a keyboard from “stdin”, so to say.So far has survived fine, and as long as there are no major changes in the browser (long polling and the JS I use have been available for several years from what I have seen in people who investigated its features). It’s a risk I accepted when I wrote it, worst case the docs are in the Pi, and then PiWrite can be used from any web browser on any modern enough device. reply fmeyer 13 hours agoparentprevI use Drafts,It can take you to places that you never thought would be possible with AI writer. reply kstrauser 12 hours agorootparentI use both. iA Writer is my definite writing app. It&#x27;s where I write any bit of non-trivial Markdown, to the point I wince when I have to use an old-fashioned word processor. Drafts is exceptional for dispatching little bits of text to other apps through its ridiculously powerful integration and scripting. For instance, if I think of something I want to post to Mastodon, I press opt-F2 to open Drafts, write it, then press F2 to send it to my server.Writer is a much better text editor IMO. (Drafts is really good, but Writer is stupendous.) Drafts is much better for interacting with or automating other apps. They&#x27;re both in my dock. reply glenngillen 12 hours agoparentprevDid you look at the SuperNote? I’ve one, and love it. It seems more hackable than the Remarkable from what I can tell, though the base functionality has been enough for me so I’ve not customised it. reply karencarits 10 hours agorootparentIt looks really nice! I have some relatives that struggle with tremor and I hope we will see such devices soon that can filter out the rapid shaking and make it easier for them to take notes reply darkteflon 6 hours agoparentprevWhat do you enjoy most about it? reply Swizec 14 hours agoparentprevBeen using iA Writer for 10+ years. It&#x27;s made me a better writer. The way it started highlighting cliches and fluffy turns of phrase a few years ago has been chef&#x27;s kiss.I wish it supported .adoc because sometimes markdown just isn&#x27;t enough. reply sergiomattei 14 hours agoparentprevThat software made me fall in love with writing.I’m a lifelong customer and it’s been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparent> one of the best purchasesKey word there: purchases. Their apps are pricey, but then you own them. I&#x27;ll take that over subscriptions every time. reply SanjayMehta 7 hours agorootparentI bought their apps when they came out, used them until I discovered Scrivener.
