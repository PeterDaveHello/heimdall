    "originBody": "Future Perfect Leaked OpenAI documents reveal aggressive tactics toward former employees Has Sam Altman told the truth about OpenAI’s NDA scandal? by Kelsey Piper May 22, 2024, 11:36 PM UTC Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, during an interview at Bloomberg House on the opening day of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland, on January 16, 2024.Bloomberg via Getty Images Kelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter. On Friday, Vox reported that employees at tech giant OpenAI who wanted to leave the company were confronted with expansive and highly restrictive exit documents. If they refused to sign in relatively short order, they were reportedly threatened with the loss of their vested equity in the company — a severe provision that's fairly uncommon in Silicon Valley. The policy had the effect of forcing ex-employees to choose between giving up what could be millions of dollars they had already earned or agreeing not to criticize the company, with no end date. According to sources inside the company, the news caused a firestorm within OpenAI, a private company that is currently valued at some $80 billion. As with many Silicon Valley startups, employees at OpenAI often get the majority of their overall expected compensation in the form of equity. They tend to assume that once it has “vested,” according to the schedule laid out in their contract, it is theirs and cannot be taken back, any more than a company would claw back salary that has been paid out. A day after the Vox piece, CEO Sam Altman posted an apology, saying: we have never clawed back anyone's vested equity, nor will we do that if people do not sign a separation agreement (or don't agree to a non-disparagement agreement). vested equity is vested equity, full stop. there was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs; although we never clawed anything back, it should never have been something we had in any documents or communication. this is on me and one of the few times i've been genuinely embarrassed running openai; i did not know this was happening and i should have. Tl;dr: I didn’t know we had provisions that threatened equity, and I promise we won’t do that anymore. That apology has been echoed in internal communications by some members of OpenAI’s executive team. In a message to employees that was leaked to Vox, OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon acknowledged that the provision had been in place since 2019 but that “The team did catch this ~month ago. The fact that it went this long before the catch is on me.” But there's a problem with those apologies from company leadership. Company documents obtained by Vox with signatures from Altman and Kwon complicate their claim that the clawback provisions were something they hadn’t known about. A separation letter on the termination documents, which you can read embedded below, says in plain language, “If you have any vested Units ... you are required to sign a release of claims agreement within 60 days in order to retain such Units.” It is signed by Kwon, along with OpenAI VP of people Diane Yoon (who departed OpenAI recently). The secret ultra-restrictive NDA, signed for only the “consideration” of already vested equity, is signed by COO Brad Lightcap. Meanwhile, according to documents provided to Vox by ex-employees, the incorporation documents for the holding company that handles equity in OpenAI contains multiple passages with language that gives the company near-arbitrary authority to claw back equity from former employees or — just as importantly — block them from selling it. Those incorporation documents were signed on April 10, 2023, by Sam Altman in his capacity as CEO of OpenAI. Vox asked OpenAI if they could provide context on whether and how these clauses made it into the incorporation documents without Altman’s knowledge. While that question was not directly answered, Kwon said in a statement to Vox, “We are sorry for the distress this has caused great people who have worked hard for us. We have been working to fix this as quickly as possible. We will work even harder to be better.” The seeming contradiction between OpenAI leadership’s recent statements and these documents has ramifications that go far beyond money. OpenAI is arguably the most influential, and certainly the most visible, company in artificial intelligence today, one that has the stated ambition to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” A little more than a week ago, OpenAI executives were on stage introducing the company’s latest model, ChatGPT-4o, which they were proud to note was capable of carrying out highly realistic conversations with users (with a voice, as it turned out, that was a bit too close to that of actress Scarlett Johansson). But bringing artificial general intelligence to the world is a role that demands enormous public trust and serious transparency. If OpenAI’s own employees haven’t felt free to voice criticism without risking financial retribution, how can the company and its CEO possibly be worthy of that trust? (Vox reviewed many documents in the course of reporting this story. Key documents of public interest are reproduced below.) High-pressure tactics at OpenAI Throughout the hundreds of pages of documents leaked to Vox, a pattern emerges. Getting ex-employees to sign the ultra-restrictive nondisparagement and nondisclosure agreement involved threatening to cancel their equity — but it also involved much more. In two cases Vox reviewed, the lengthy, complex termination documents OpenAI sent out expired after seven days. That meant the former employees had a week to decide whether to accept OpenAI’s muzzle or risk forfeiting what could be millions of dollars — a tight timeline for a decision of that magnitude, and one that left little time to find outside counsel. When ex-employees asked for more time to seek legal aid and review the documents, they faced significant pushback from OpenAI. “The General Release and Separation Agreement requires your signature within 7 days,” a representative told one employee in an email this spring when the employee asked for another week to review the complex documents. “We want to make sure you understand that if you don't sign, it could impact your equity. That's true for everyone, and we're just doing things by the book,” an OpenAI representative emailed a second employee who had asked for two more weeks to review the agreement. (I spoke with four experts in employment and labor law for perspective on whether the termination agreement and surrounding conduct was indeed “by the book” or standard in the industry. “For a company to threaten to claw back already-vested equity is egregious and unusual,” California employment law attorney Chambord Benton-Hayes told me in an emailed statement.) Most ex-employees folded under the pressure. For those who persisted, the company pulled out another tool in what one former employee called the “legal retaliation toolbox” he encountered on leaving the company. When he declined to sign the first termination agreement sent to him and sought legal counsel, the company changed tactics. Rather than saying they could cancel his equity if he refused to sign the agreement, they said he could be prevented from selling his equity. The later documents the company sent him, which Vox has reviewed, say, “If you have any vested Units and you do not sign the exit documents, including the General Release, as required by company policy, it is important to understand that, among other things, you will not be eligible to participate in future tender events or other liquidity opportunities that we may sponsor or facilitate as a private company.” In other words, sign or give up the chance to sell your equity. How OpenAI played hardball To make sense of that — and to see why it makes OpenAI’s recent apology so hollow — you need to understand what equity at OpenAI means. In a publicly traded company, like Google, equity just means shares of stock. Employees are paid partially in their salary and partially in Google stock, which they can hold or sell on the stock market like any shareholder. In a private company like OpenAI, employees are still awarded ownership shares of the company (or, more frequently, options to purchase ownership shares of the company at low prices) but have to wait until an opportunity to sell those shares — which may not come for years. Large private companies sometimes do “tender offers” where employees and former employees can sell their equity. OpenAI hosts tender offers sometimes, but the exact details are a tightly kept secret. By announcing that someone who doesn’t sign the restrictive agreement is locked out of all future tender offers, OpenAI effectively makes that equity, valued at millions of dollars, conditional on the employee signing the agreement — while still truthfully saying that they technically haven’t clawed back anyone’s vested equity, as Altman claimed in his tweet on May 18. Vox reached out to OpenAI to clarify whether OpenAI has used or plans to use this tactic to cut former employees off from equity. An OpenAI spokesperson said, “Historically, former employees have been eligible to sell at the same price regardless of where they work; we don’t expect that to change.” It is not clear who authorized telling a former employee that he would be excluded from all future tender offers unless he signed. And the ex-employees I spoke with were nervous that, whatever public reassurances the company may be making, the incorporation documents generally gave OpenAI many avenues for legal retaliation, making it less reassuring for the company to retreat from any specific one. In addition to clauses stating that vested equity will vanish if a former employee does not sign a general release within 60 days, the incorporation documents also contain clauses stating that, “at the sole and absolute discretion of the company,” any employee who is terminated by the company can have their vested equity holdings reduced to zero. There are also clauses stating that the company has absolute discretion over which employees are allowed to participate in tender offers in which their equity is sold. “[Those] documents are supposed to be putting the mission of building safe and beneficial AGI first but instead they set up multiple ways to retaliate against departing employees who speak in any way that criticizes the company,” a source close to the company told me. These documents are signed by Sam Altman. OpenAI did not respond to a question about whether there was a contradiction between Altman’s public statements that he was unaware company documents included language about clawing back equity and the presence of these clauses in incorporation documents with his signature on them. Why it matters OpenAI has long positioned itself as a company that ought to be held to a higher standard. It claimed that its unique corporate structure — which involved a for-profit company governed by a nonprofit — would let them bring transformative technology to the world and ensure it “benefits all of humanity,” as the company mission statement reads, and not just the shareholders. OpenAI’s senior leadership has talked at length about their responsibilities for accountability, transparency, and democratic input, with Altman himself telling Congress last year that “my worst fears are that we — the field, the technology, the industry — cause significant harm to the world.” But for all the high-minded idealism, OpenAI has also had its share of scandals. In November, Altman was fired by the OpenAI board, which said in a statement only that Altman “was not consistently candid with the board.” The clumsy firing provoked an immediate outcry from employees, especially as the board failed to provide any more detailed explanation of what had justified firing the CEO of a world-leading tech company. Altman soon arranged a deal to effectively take the company and most of its employees with him to Microsoft, before he was ultimately reinstated, with much of the board then resigning. At the time, the board’s language — “not consistently candid” — was puzzling. (Has anyone ever met a CEO who is consistently candid?) But six months on, it seems like we might be starting to see publicly some of the issues that drove the unexpected board conflagration. OpenAI can still set things right, and may now be getting started on the long and difficult process of doing so. They have taken some first, necessary steps. Altman’s initial statement was criticized for doing too little to make things right for former employees, but in an emailed statement, OpenAI told me that “we are identifying and reaching out to former employees who signed a standard exit agreement to make it clear that OpenAI has not and will not cancel their vested equity and releases them from nondisparagement obligations” — which goes much further toward fixing their mistake. In a fuller statement, OpenAI said: “As we shared with employees today, we are making important updates to our departure process. We have not and never will take away vested equity, even when people didn't sign the departure documents. We're removing nondisparagement clauses from our standard departure paperwork, and we're releasing former employees from existing nondisparagement obligations unless the nondisparagement provision was mutual. We'll communicate this message to former employees. We're incredibly sorry that we're only changing this language now; it doesn't reflect our values or the company we want to be.” I think that represents a huge step forward over the company’s initial May 18 apology; it is specific about the steps OpenAI is taking and involves proactively reaching out to former employees. But I think OpenAI’s work here is far from done. Former employees felt the company put them under pressure from multiple angles, and OpenAI has not yet committed to changing all of those — specifically, they should commit to not excluding anyone from selling their equity on the basis of not signing a document or criticizing Open AI. And, to fully grapple with the situation, OpenAI needs to grapple with responsibility. It's hard to understand how the executive team could have signed documents that laid out avenues to claw back equity from former employees, as well as separation letters which threatened to do the same, without realizing this situation was happening. In order to set this issue right, OpenAI must first acknowledge how extensive it was. How I reported this story Reporting is full of lots of tedious moments, but then there's the occasional “whoa” moment. Reporting this story had three major moments of “whoa.” The first is when I reviewed an employee termination contract and saw it casually stating that as “consideration” for signing this super-strict agreement, the employee would get to keep their already vested equity. That might not mean much to people outside the tech world, but I knew that it meant OpenAI had crossed a line many in tech consider close to sacred. The second “whoa” moment was when I reviewed the second termination agreement sent to one ex-employee who'd challenged the legality of OpenAI's scheme. The company, rather than defending the legality of its approach, had just jumped ship to a new approach. That led to the third “whoa” moment. I read through the incorporation document that the company cited as the reason it had the authority to do this and confirmed that it did seem to give the company a lot of license to take back vested equity and block employees from selling it. So I scrolled down to the signature page, wondering who at OpenAI had set all this up. The page had three signatures. All three of them were Sam Altman. I slacked my boss on a Sunday night, \"Can I call you briefly?\" Check out the documents supporting this reporting below: Update, May 22, 7:32 pm ET: This story has been updated to include a fuller statement from OpenAI.

It's really easy to make people whole for this, so whether that happens or not is the difference between the apologies being real or just them just backpedaling because employees got upset. Edit: Looks like they're doing the right thing here: > Altman’s initial statement was criticized for doing too little to make things right for former employees, but in an emailed statement, OpenAI told me that “we are identifying and reaching out to former employees who signed a standard exit agreement to make it clear that OpenAI has not and will not cancel their vested equity and releases them from nondisparagement obligations” — which goes much further toward fixing their mistake. reply NotSammyHagar 20 hours agoparentThis reads like more than standard restrictions. I hate those like everyone, they are just intended to chill complaints in my opinion with enough question to scare average people without legal expertise (like me, like most devs), just like non-competes used to seemingly primarily be used to discourage looking at other jobs, separate from whether it was enforceable - note the recent FTC decision to end non-competes. About 5 months ago I had a chance to join a company, their company had what looked like an extreme non-compete to me, you couldn't work for any company for the next two years after leaving if they had been a customer of that company. I pointed out to them that I wouldn't have been able to join their company if my previous job had that non-compete clause, it seemed excessive. Eventually I was in meetings with a lawyer at the company who told me it's probably not enforceable, don't worry about it, and the FTC is about to end non-competes. I said great, strike it from the contract and I'll sign it right now. He said I can't do that, no one off contracts. So then I said I'm not working there. reply tedivm 20 hours agorootparentI have worked for multiple startups (Malwarebytes, Vicarious, Rad AI, Explosion AI, Aptible, Kenna Security). Not once have I seen an exit agreement that stated they would steal back my vested equity if I didn't sign. This is definitely not \"standard restrictions\". reply ungreased0675 15 hours agorootparentAnytime someone tried to get me to sign a terrible contract, they always said “This is just standard stuff.” reply ornornor 12 hours agorootparentSame. And in the same breath they also added “this is never used anyway, it’s just the template”. But “no it can’t be removed from the contract” reply mpweiher 12 hours agorootparentI always respond with \"if it's never enforced, then you'll be fine with me taking it out\" Then I strike the offending passage out on both copies of the contract, sign and hand it back to them. Your move. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ reply hollowpython 11 hours agorootparentDo you really do this, and is striking out a line of a contract binding? reply mpweiher 10 hours agorootparentYes, I really do this. Have done since I started working. At one of my first jobs as a student employee they offered me a salary X. In the contract there was some lower number Y. When I pointed this out, they said \"X includes the bonus. It's not in the contract but we've never not paid it\". OK, if this is really guaranteed, you can make that the salary and put it in writing. They did, my salary was X and that year was the first time they didn't pay the optional bonus. Didn't affect me, because I had my salary X. IANAL and I don't know how binding this is. I'd think it's crucial for it to be in both copies of the contract, otherwise you could have just crossed it out after the fact, which would of course not be legally binding at all and probably fraud (?) In practice, it doesn't really come up, because the legal department will produce a modified contract or start negotiating the point. The key is that the ball is now in their court. You've done your part, are ready and rearin' to go, and they are the ones holding things up and being difficult, for something that according to them isn't important. UPDATE: I think it's important to note that I am also perfectly fine with a verbal agreement. A working relationship depends on mutual trust, so a contract is there for putting in a drawer and never looking at it again...and conversely if you are looking at it again after signing, both the trust and the working relationship are most likely over. But it has to be consistent: if you insist on a binding written agreement, then I will make sure what is written is acceptable to me. You don't get to pick and choose. reply WhrRTheBaboons 5 hours agorootparentprev(EU perspective) it is binding. you just add both parties' initials/signature on the margin of each line that was changed. reply darkwater 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy not? A labor contract is a 2-ways street. If the company doesn't like the new version, they will not sign it and not hire you. reply mpweiher 9 hours agorootparentExactly. And just like I have to be fine with not getting the job if my conditions are not acceptable to them, they have to be fine with not getting me if their conditions are not acceptable to me. Considering the considerable effort that has gone into this by the time you are negotiating a contract, letting it fail over something that \"is not important\" and \"is never enforced\" would be very stupid of them. So if they are unwilling to budge, that either means they were lying all along and the thing that's \"never enforced\" and is \"not important\" actually is very important to them and definitely will be enforced, or that they are a company that will enforce arbitrary and pointless rules on employees as long as they think they can. Neither of which is a great advertisement for the company as an employer. reply darkwater 9 hours agorootparent> So if they are unwilling to budge, that either means they were lying all along and the thing that's \"never enforced\" and is \"not important\" actually is very important to them and definitely will be enforced, or that they are a company that will enforce arbitrary and pointless rules on employees as long as they think they can. Most of the time is basically just FUD, to coerce people into following the rule-that-is-never-enforced reply mrguyorama 18 minutes agorootparentIt's always \"not enforced\" or \"just a template\" right up until they decide they need to pressure you into something and then they will have no problem referencing those items. Do not sign a contract unless you are willing to entirely submit to everything in it that is legally binding. Also be careful with extremely vague contracts. My employment contract was basically \"You will do whatever we need you to do\" and surprise surprise, unpaid overtime is expected. nielsole 10 hours agorootparentprevI've seen legal departments redlining drafts of a contract repeatedly until an agreement had been reached. The final contract still contained the red lines. reply alfiedotwtf 7 hours agorootparentprevIANAL but I've seen strikes throughout contracts, and then an initial+date from both parties. Weird how in 2024 an initial that's so easily forgeable can be legally binding reply retrac 6 hours agorootparentA verbal contract, which has no record at all, can also be legally binding. reply cubefox 7 hours agorootparentprevI would guess that the initial is not the important thing, but that the strike is present on both copies of the contract. reply DonHopkins 11 hours agorootparentprevDon't forget to initial the crossed-out section and draw a passive aggressive happy face! reply cyrillite 6 hours agorootparentprev“This is just standard stuff” belongs in a category of phrases like “this is perfectly legal”. reply benreesman 17 hours agorootparentprevI’ve heard of some pretty aggressive non-competes in finance, but AFAIU (never worked in Connecticut myself), it’s both the carrot and the stick: you get both paid and a stiff contract if you leave with proprietary alpha between the ears. In tech I’ve never even heard a rumor of something like this. reply whitej125 17 hours agorootparentIt’s got a term - “garden leave” and yeah it was prevalent in finance. I say “was” because I think some states are changing laws wrt/ non-competes and this calling this practice into question. reply tomp 7 hours agorootparentNo, you're confusing stuff. First of all, taking any code with you is theft, and you go to jail, like this poor Goldman Sachs programmer [1]. This will happen even if the code has no alpha. However, noone can prevent you from taking knowledge (i.e. your memories), so reimplementing alpha elsewhere is fine. Of course, the best alpha is that which cannot simply be replicated, e.g. it depends on proprietary datasets, proprietary hardware (e.g. fast links between exchanges), access to cheap capital, etc. What hedge funds used to do, is give you lengthy non-competes. 6months for junior staff, 1-2y for traders, 3y+ in case of Renaissance Technologies. In the US, that's now illegal and un-enforceable. So what hedge funds do now, is lengthy garden(ing) leaves. This means you still work for the company, you still earn a salary, and in some (many? all?) cases also the bonus. But you don't go to the office, you can't access any code, you don't see any trades. The company \"moves on\" (developes/refines its alpha, including your alpha - alpha you created) and you don't. These lengthy garden leaves replaced non-competes, so they're now 1y+. AFAIK they are enforceable, just as non-competes while being employed always have been. [1] https://nypost.com/2018/10/23/ex-goldman-programmer-sentence... reply lotsofpulp 16 hours agorootparentprevThe federal government banned non competes last month: https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/... reply d4mi3n 15 hours agorootparentI think this still leaves garden leave on the table. The thing that can no longer happen is an employer ending it's relationship with an employee and preventing them from continuing their career after the fact. Garden leave was in fact one of the least bad outcomes of a non-compete as I understand it. reply kelnos 11 hours agorootparentprevI don't recall where I saw it, but I believe the FTC clarified and said that garden-leave type arrangements aren't covered under their ban. reply danielmarkbruce 20 hours agorootparentprevComp clawbacks are quite common in finance, at least contractually. It's rare for it to go ahead, but it happens. It isn't some especially weird thing. reply tedivm 19 hours agorootparentComp clawbacks in exit agreements, that weren't part of the employment agreement? I've seen equity clawbacks in employment agreements. Specifically, some of the contracts I've signed have said that if I'm fired for cause (and were a bit more specific, like financial fraud or something) then I'd lose my vested equity. That isn't uncommon, but its not typically used to silence people and is part of the agreement they review and approve of before becoming an employee. It's not a surprise that they learn about as they try to leave. reply danielmarkbruce 19 hours agorootparentIt must have been part of the original employment document package, that the equity was cancellable. In the details of the equity grant, or similar, somewhere. reply tsimionescu 16 hours agorootparentAccording to the Vox article, it's much more complicated legally. It's not part of each employee's contract that allows this, it's part of the articles of incorporation of the for-profit part of OpenAI. reply ecjhdnc2025 18 hours agorootparentprevMust it? Not clear what you mean. Do you mean it is generic to do that in contracts? (Been a while since I was offered equity.) Or do you mean that even OpenAI would not try it without having set it up in the original contract? Because I hate to be the guy with the square brackets ;-) reply ajb 17 hours agorootparentIf it wasn't in the original contracts for the equity, they wouldn't be able to claw back. Fairly obviously, the mechanism can't be in the exit agreement because you didn't sign that yet. Normally a company has to give you new \"consideration\" (which is the legal term for something of value) for you to want to sign an exit agreement - otherwise you can just not bother to sign. Usually this is extra compensation. In this case they are saying that they won't exercise some clause in an existing agreement that allows them to claw back. reply tsimionescu 16 hours agorootparentPer the Vox article, it's not directly in the contract you sign for the equity, it's basically part of the definition of the equity itself (the articles of incorporation of the for-profit company) that OpenAI remains in full control of the equity in this way. reply danielmarkbruce 18 hours agorootparentprevIt must. Joke aside - I'm saying \"it must\" the same way someone might say \"surely\". reply ecjhdnc2025 17 hours agorootparentWise. Stops people saying \"and don't call me Shirley!\" reply dmvdoug 17 hours agorootparentDon’t call me Shirley. reply adastra22 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat is the structure of those compensations, and the mechanism for the clawbacks? Equity is taxed when it becomes the full, unrestricted property of the employee, so depending on the structure these threatened clawbacks could have either (1) been very illegal [essentially theft], or (2) could have had drastic and very bad tax consequences for all employees, current and former. I'm not surprised that they're rapidly backpedaling. reply londons_explore 19 hours agorootparent> taxed when it becomes the full, unrestricted property of the employee I guess these agreements mean that the property isn't full unrestricted property of the employee... and therefore income tax isn't payable when they vest. The tax isn't avoided - it would just be paid when you sell the shares instead - which for most people would be a worse deal because you'll probably sell them at a higher price than the vest price. reply semi-extrinsic 14 hours agorootparent> which for most people would be a worse deal It's a worse deal in retrospect for a successfull company. But there and then it's not very attractive to pay an up-front tax on something that you can sell at an unknown price in the relatively far future. reply danielmarkbruce 19 hours agorootparentprevNot sure how they deal with the tax. Ping John Stumpf (former Wells CEO) and ask, he probably has time on his hands and scar tissue and can explain it. reply minhazm 19 hours agorootparentprevCan you find any specific examples? I've only seen that apply to severance agreements where you're being paid some additional sum for that non-disparagement clause. Never seen anything that says money or equity you've already earned could be clawed back. reply Bluecobra 18 hours agorootparentI negotiated a starting bonus with my employer and signed a contract that I would need to pay it back if I quit within a year. reply danielmarkbruce 19 hours agorootparentprevWells Fargo clawed back from the CEO (and a couple others if I remember) over the fake account scandals. reply ecjhdnc2025 18 hours agorootparentRight, but would that have been achieved with a clause open-ended enough to allow this additional paperwork on exit? Or would that have been an \"if you break the law\" thing? Seems unlikely that OpenAI are legally in the clear here with nice clear precedent. Why? Because they are backflipping to deny it's something they'd ever do. reply tsimionescu 5 hours agorootparentI think they are backpedaling rapidly to avoid major discontent among their workers. By the definition of their stock as laid out in their articles of incorporation, they have the right to reduce any former employee's stock to 0, or to prevent them from ever selling it, which is basically the same thing. This makes their stock offers to employees much less valuable than the appear at face value, so their current and future employees may very well start demanding actual dollars instead. reply throwaway2037 18 hours agorootparentprev> Comp clawbacks are quite common in finance Common? Absolutely not. It might be common for a tiny fraction of investment bank staff who are considered (1) material risk takers, (2) revenue generators, or (3) senior management. reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparentprev> Comp clawbacks are quite common in finance, at least contractually Never negotiated on exit. reply danielmarkbruce 19 hours agorootparentI don't think it was negotiated on exit. It was threatened on exit. The ability to do it was almost certainly already in place. reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agorootparent> The ability to do it was almost certainly already in place Why? OpenAI is a shitshow. Their legal structure is a mess. Yanking vested equity on the basis of a post-purchase agreement signed under duress sounds closer to securities fraud than anything thought out. reply danielmarkbruce 17 hours agorootparentI'm not saying it was thought out, I'm saying it was in place. My understanding is that the shareholders agreement had something which enabled the canceling of the shares (not sure if it was all shares, shares granted to employees, or what).

Friends and former colleagues pushed back against that (very publicly and for obvious reasons in one case) and didn’t get to keep their vested options: they had to exercise what they had before leaving. There was one thing that I cared about (anti-competitive behavior, things could technically be illegal, but what counts is policy so it really depends on what the local authority wants to enforce), so I asked a lawyer, and they said: No way this agreement prevents you from answering that kind of questioning. reply srockets 18 hours agorootparentA 90 days exercise window is standard (and there are tax implications as well in play).

The degree itself wasn’t worth a damn, but the network was invaluable. I have very close friends who are the exact kind of attorney who you would expect to have an undergraduate business degree. They’re greedy, combative people who absolutely relish these sorts of opportunities. And as a bonus, they are MY greedy, combative people who relish these sorts of opportunities. They’re great partners when confronted with this kind of contract. And fundamentally, if my adversary/future employer retains counsel, I should too. Why be at a disadvantage when it’s so easy to pay money and be at even? There are some areas my ethics don’t mesh with, but at the end of the day this is my work and I do it for pay.

Almost all contracts with stuff like this would have a “severability” clause which states like if one part of the contract is invalid, the rest is still valid. But even without that, judges have huge amounts of leeway to “create” an ex post facto contract and say “heres the version if that contract you would have agreed to, this is now the contract you signed”. A sort of “fixed” version of the contract. reply dragonwriter 14 hours agorootparent> At most it would just make that part of the contract void. Almost all contracts with stuff like this would have a “severability” clause which states like if one part of the contract is invalid, the rest is still valid.

Given the situation, undoing the agreement is an act of basic self-preservation at this point. The documents show this really was not a mistake and \"I didn't know what the legal documents I signed meant, which specifically had a weird clause that standard agreements don't\" isn't much of a defence either.

Also, while YouTube videos are not labelled directly, you can extract signal from the title, the captions, and perhaps even the comments. Lastly, many sources online use YouTube to host videos and embed them on their pages, which probably contains more text data that can be used as labels. reply optimalsolver 12 hours agoparentprev*Murati reply blackeyeblitzar 6 hours agoparentprevTo be fair I don’t think Google deserves exclusive rights to contents created by others, just because they own a monopolistic video platform.

If anyone reads that and still has a concern, I'd be happy to take a crack at answering further. The short version is that users flagged that one plus it set off the flamewar detector, and we didn't turn the penalties off because the post didn't contain significant new information (SNI), which is the test we apply (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so...). Current post does contain SNI so it's still high on HN's front page. Why do we do it this way? Not to protect any organization (including YC itself, and certainly including OpenAI or any other BigCo), but simply to avoid repetition. Repetition is the opposite of intellectual curiosity (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&so...), which is what we're hoping to optimize for (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor...).

Most especially when it is unsubstantive + indignant. This is the most important thing we've figured out about improving thread quality in the last 10 years. But it doesn't vary based on specific persons (not Sam or anyone else). Substantive criticism is fine, but predictable one-liners and that sort of thing are not what we want here—especially since they evoke even worse from others. The idea of HN is to have an internet forum—to the extent possible—where discussion remains intellectually interesting.

I'd say I would have a lot on my plate to worry about, the least of which the legal part that the company inherited. In this scenario it is probable that hostile clauses in contracts would be dug up.

The big change is bad faith argument developing into unapologetic bad faith developing into weaponised bad faith. It accelerated rapidly with some trends like the Tea Party, Gamergate, Brexit, Andrew Wakefield, covid antivax, and the Ukraine situation, and is in evidence on both sides of the trans rights debate, in doxxing, in almost every single argument on X that goes past ten tweets, etc. It's something many on the left have generally identified as worse from the right wing or alt.right. But this is just because it's easier to categorise it when it's pointing at you. It's actually the primary toxicity of all argument in the 21st century. And the reason is that weaponised bad faith is addictive fun for the operator. Basically everyone gets to be Lee Atwater or Roger Stone for a bit, and everyone loves it. reply ants_everywhere 19 hours agorootparent> It's something many on the left have generally identified as worse from the right wing or alt.right. It depends a bit by what you mean by left and right, but if you take something like Marxism that was always 100% a propaganda effort created by people who owned newspapers and the pervasiveness of propaganda has been a through line e.g. in the Soviet Union, agitprop etc. A big part of the Marxist theory is that there is no reality, that social experience completely determines everything, and that sort of ideology naturally lends itself to the belief that blankets of bad faith arguments for \"good causes\" are a positive good. This sort of thinking was unpopular on the left for many years, but it's become more hip no doubt thanks to countries like Russia and China trying to re-popularize communism in the West. reply ecjhdnc2025 19 hours agorootparentPropaganda at a national level, it's always been that, and I take your point for sure. I think perhaps I didn't really make it totally clear that what I'm mostly talking about is a bit closer to the personal level -- the way people fight their corners, the way twitter level debate works, the way local politicians behave. The individual, ghastly shamelessness of it, more than the organised wall of lies. Everyone getting to play Roger Stone. Not so much broadcast bad faith as narrowcast. I get the impression Stalinism was more like this -- you know, you have your petty level of power and you _lie_ to your superiors to maintain it, but you use weaponised bad faith to those you have power over. It's a kind of emotional cruelty, to lie to people in ways they know are lies, that make them do things they know are wrong, and to make it obvious you don't care. And we see this everywhere now. reply ants_everywhere 18 hours agorootparentWell, I was referring to Marx and Engels. That's sort of how the whole movement got started. The post-Hegelians who turned away from logic-based philosophical debate to a sort of anti-logical emotional debate where facts mattered less than the arc of history. That got nationalized and industrialized with Lenin and Stalin etc, but that trend precedes them and was more personal. It was hashed out in coffee houses and drinking clubs. You see the same pattern with social media accounts who claim to be on the Maxist-influenced left. Their tactics are very frequently emotionally abusive or manipulative. It's basically indistinguishable in style from how people on the fringe right behave. Personally I don't think it's a right vs left thing. It's more about authoritarianism and the desire to crush the people you feel are violating the rules, especially if it seems like they're getting away with violating the rules. There are just some differences about what people think the rules are. reply ecjhdnc2025 18 hours agorootparent> Personally I don't think it's a right vs left thing.

The headline of the article is a little funny, because records can't really show they weren't looking for an SJ sound-alike. They can just show that those records didn't mention it. The key decision-makers could simply have agreed to keep that fact close-to-the-vest -- they may have well understood that knocking off a high-profile actress was legally perilous. Also, I think we can readily assume OpenAI understood that one of their potential voices sounded a lot like SJ. Since they were pursuing her they must have had a pretty good idea of what they were going after, especially considering the likely price tag. So even if an SJ voice wasn't the original goal, it clearly became an important goal to them. They surely listened to demos for many voice actors, auditioned a number of them, and may even have recorded many of them, but somehow they selected one for release who seemed to sound a lot like SJ. reply HarHarVeryFunny 3 hours agoparentClearly an SJ voice was the goal, given that Altman asked her to do it, asked her a second time just two days before the ChatGPT-4o release, and then tweeted \"her\" on the release day. The next day Karpathy, recently ex-OpenAI, then tweets \"The killer app of LLMs is Scarlett Johansson\". Altman appears to be an habitual liar. Note his recent claim not to be aware of the non-disparagement and claw-back terms he had departing employees agree to. Are we supposed to believe that the company lawyer or head of HR did this without consulting (or more likely being instructed by) the co-founder and CEO?! reply tptacek 3 hours agorootparentThey hired the actor that did the voice months before they contacted SJ. The reaction on this site to the news that this story was false is kind of mindbending. reply summerlight 2 hours agorootparentMy guess: Sam wanted to imitate the voice from Her and became aware of Midler v. Ford cases so reached out to SJ. He probably didn't expect her decline. Anyway, this prior case tells that you cannot mimic other's voice without their permission and the overall timeline indicates OpenAI's \"intention\" of imitation. It does not matter if they used SJ's voice in the training set or not. Their intention matters. reply kstrauser 1 hour agorootparentPlease don't take this as me defending OpenAI's clearly sketchy process. I'm writing this to help myself think through it. If it weren't for their attempt to link the voice to SJ (i.e. with the \"her\" tweet), would that be OK? - It's fine to hire a voice actor. - It's fine to train a system to sound like that voice actor. - It's fine to hire a voice actor who sounds like someone else. - It's probably fine to go out of your way to hire a voice actor who sounds like someone else. - It's probably not fine to hire a voice actor and tell them to imitate someone else. - It's very likely not fine to market your AI as \"sounds like Jane Doe, who sounds like SJ\". - It's definitely not fine to market your AI as \"sounds like SJ\". Say I wanted to make my AI voice sound like Patrick Stewart. Surely it's OK to hire an English actor who sounds a lot like him, so long as I don't use Sir Patrick's name in the advertising. If so, would it have been OK for OpenAI to do all this as long as they didn't mention SJ? Or is SJ so clearly identifiable with her role in \"Her\" that it's never OK to try to make a product like \"Her\" that sounds like SJ? reply summerlight 1 hour agorootparentThere's no clear line for this. To get the definite conclusion, you will need to bring this to the court with lots of investigation. I know this kind of ambiguity is frustrating, but the context and intention matter a lot here and unfortunately we don't have a better way than a legal battle to figure it out. Thanks to Sam, this OpenAI case is clearer than others since he made a number of clear evidence against him. reply kstrauser 1 hour agorootparentSure. And I'm not necessarily concerned about the outcome of the seemingly inevitable lawsuit. I'm more interested in calibrating my own moral compass here. If I were asked to participate in this, where would my comfort zone be? I'll defer to a judge and jury about the legalities. As you noted, Sam gave them a lot of help. reply suoduandao3 26 minutes agorootparentMy own thought is - every artist in history has taken inspiration from previous artists. The British voice actor in the above example surely studied greats in his field like Sir Patrick. We don't typically mind that. Where I think the line is between standing on the shoulders of giants and devaluing someone else's art is how well digested, for lack of a better term, the inspiration has been. Is the later artist breaking the components out, examining each, and assembling them with the insights they gained? Or are they seeking to resemble the end result as much as possible? I think that separates the cheap hack from the person who 'steals like an artist' reply beeboobaa3 1 hour agorootparentprev> It's probably not fine to hire a voice actor and tell them to imitate someone else.

Not necessarily, when you're hiring them because they like someone else—especially someone else who has said that they don't want to work with you.

There are certainly ways they could have avoided doing so, and I'm not sure I understand the value of trying to dissect it into a dozen tiny pieces and debate which particular detail pushes it over the line from ambiguous to hard-to-deny? Maybe I don't understand what kind of clarity you're trying to achieve here. This particular area of law or even just type of \"fairness\" is by necessity very muddy, there isn't a set of well-defined rules you can follow that will guarantee an outcome where everyone is happy no matter what, sometimes you have to step back and evaluate how people feel about things at various steps along the way. I'd speculate that OAI's attempts to reach out to SJ are probably the result of those evaluations - \"this seems like it could make her people upset, so maybe we should pay her to not be mad?\" reply Alupis 1 hour agorootparentprevI cannot read the article because of it's paywall - is there actual proof OpenAI reached out to Johansson - or is it just being alleged by her lawyers? It seems she has every reason to benefit from claiming Sky sounded like her even if it was a coincidence. \"Go away\" payments are very common, even for celebrities - and OpenAI has deep pockets... Even so, if they got a voice actor to impersonate or sound similar to Johansson, is that something that's not allowed? reply supermatt 2 hours agorootparentprevEven if the voice actor was sourced before they originally contacted SJ, it was clearly the intent to sound like her. There are so many other distinctive voices they could have chosen, but instead they decided to go as close as possible to \"her\" as they could. Many people thought it was SJ until she stated it wasn't. I appreciate the voice actor may sound like that naturally, but its hardly coincidental that the voice that sounds most like the voice from \"her\" was the one chosen for their promotion. It is clearly an attempt to pass-off. reply HarHarVeryFunny 2 hours agorootparentprevSure, no-one is disputing that, and despite this Altman then contacts SJ again two days before release asking her to reconsider, then tweets \"her\" to remind the public what he was shooting for. The goal could have just been ChatGPT with a voice interface, but instead Altman himself is saying the the goal was specifically to copy \"her\". reply jackothy 2 hours agorootparentHe's not necessarily saying that was the goal from the start. All he is admitting with that tweet is that it is indeed (he finds it to be) reminiscent of \"Her\". reply HarHarVeryFunny 1 hour agorootparentWell, from the start, Altman wanted SJ to do the voice. Perhaps he'd never seen or heard of the movie \"her\", and the association is just coincidental? After \"she\" said no, then Altman auditions a bunch of voice talent and picks someone who sounds just like SJ. I guess that's just the kind of voice he likes. So, Altman has forgotten about SJ, has 5 voice talents in the bag, and is good to go, right? But then, 2 days(!) before the release he calls SJ again, asking her to reconsider (getting nervous about what he's about to release, perhaps?). But still, maybe we should give Altman the benefit of the doubt, and assume he wanted SJ so badly because he had a crush on her or something? Then on release day, Altman tweets \"her\", and reveals a demo not of a sober AI assistant with a voice interface, but of a cringe-inducing AI girlfriend trying to be flirty and emotional. He could have picked any of the five voices for the demo, but you know ... But as you say, he's not admitting anything. When he tweeted \"her\" maybe it was because he saw the movie for the first time the night before? reply LocalPCGuy 45 minutes agorootparent> After \"she\" said no, then Altman auditions a bunch of voice talent and picks someone who sounds just like SJ. According to the article, the word After here is incorrect. It states the voice actor was hired months before the first contact with SJ. They might be lying, but when they hired the voice actor seems like it would be a verifiable fact that has contracts and other documentation. And like others, not defending OpenAI, but that timeline does tend to break the narrative you put forth in this post. reply Beldin 57 minutes agorootparentprevAnd if you commision an artist to draw a black-leather tight-fit clad red-head superspy in an ad for tour product, it need not look like Black Widow from the MCU. But if it does look very much like her, it doesn't really matter whether you never intended to. reply jackothy 35 minutes agorootparentYou can see plenty of discussion elsewhere in this thread regarding how similar the result actually ended up being. All I'm saying in the comment you are replying to is that it's incorrect to claim that Altman's saying that \"the goal was specifically to copy 'Her'\". reply dragonwriter 44 minutes agorootparentprevLegally, the issue isn’t what they were thinking when they hired the actor, it’s what the intent and effect was when they went to market. (Even if there was documentary evidence that they actively sought out an actor for resemblance to SJ’s voice from day one, the only reason that would be relevant is because it would also support that that was there intent with the product when it was actually released, not because it is independently relevant on its own.) Whether or not they had any interest in SJ’s voice when they hired the other actor, they clearly developed such an interest before they went to market, and there is at least an evidence-based argument that could be made in court that they did, in fact, commercially leverage similarity. reply not2b 1 hour agorootparentprevIt was not claimed that they cloned ScarJo's voice. They hired a soundalike when they couldn't get the person they wanted. Use or lack of use of AI is irrelevant. As I said before, both Bette Midler and Tom Waits won similar cases. Since they withdrew the voice this will end, but if OpenAI hadn't backed off and ScarJo sued, there would be discovery, and we'd find out what her instructions were. If those instructions were \"try to sound like the AI in the film Her\", that would be enough for ScarJo to win. I know that the Post article claims otherwise. I'm skeptical. reply dragonwriter 19 minutes agorootparent> It was not claimed that they cloned ScarJo’s voice. There were some claims by some people when the issue first arose that they had specifically done a deepfake clone of SJ’s voice; probably because of the combination of apparent trading on the similarity and the nature of OpenAI’s business. That’s not the case as far as the mechanism by which the voice was produced. reply itronitron 1 hour agorootparentprev>> They hired the actor that did the voice months before they contacted SJ. Are you saying that story is false? reply foobarqux 33 minutes agorootparentprevI don't understand the point you are trying to make. The essential question is whether they were trying to imitate (using a voice actor or otherwise) Scarlett Johansson's voice without her permission. Nothing in the article refutes that they were; whether they sought the permission before or after they started doing the imitation is irrelevant. Others have pointed to previous case law that shows that this form of imitation is illegal. Moreover I can't see any reasonable person concluding that they were not trying to imitate her voice given that: 1. It sounds similar to her (It's unbelievable that anyone would argue that they aren't similar, moreso given #2). 2. Her voice is famous for the context in which synthetic voice is used 3. They contacted her at some point to get her permission to use her voice 4. The CEO referenced the movie which Johansson's voice is famous for (and again, depicts the same context the synthetic voice is being used) shortly before they released the synthetic voice. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but then again, I totally expected this opening the comment threads. Same happened with RMS debacle, same happened with similar events earlier, same happened on many a Musk stories. It seems that a neat narrative with clear person/object to hate, once established, is extremely resilient to facts that disprove it. reply bnralt 1 hour agorootparentRight. Even if you think OpenAI isn’t a good place, this is an investigation by an established newspaper that refuted some of the more serious accusations (that OpenAI got a Johannson impersonator - they didn’t, that they modified the voice to sound like Johansson - evidence suggests this didn’t happen). When the reaction is “I don’t care that an investigation refuted some of the accusations”, it demonstrates someone isn’t openly approaching things in good faith. Likewise, if someone’s attitude is - “OK, maybe there’s no paper trail, but I’m sure this is what the people were thinking”, then you’ve made an accusation that simply can’t be refuted, no matter how much evidence gets presented. reply sanderjd 1 hour agorootparent> refuted some of the more serious accusations (that OpenAI got a Johannson impersonator - they didn’t A lot of the argument here comes down to whether the article does refute that. I don't believe it does. What it refutes is the accusation that they hired someone who sounds like Johansson after she told them she would not do it herself. That was certainly a more damning accusation, but it's not an identical one. But in my view, it requires a pretty absurd level of benefit of the doubt to think that they didn't set out to make a voice that sounds like the one from the movie. Maybe good for them that they felt icky about it, and tried to get her for real instead, but she said no, and they didn't feel icky enough about it to change the plan. Do you believe the article \"refutes\" that? Does it truly not strike you as a likely scenario, given what is known, both before and after this reporting? reply bnralt 1 hour agorootparent> A lot of the argument here comes down to whether the article does refute that. It clearly refutes the claims that they got a Johansson impersonator. The article says this is a voice actress, speaking in her normal voice, who wasn’t told to mimic Johansson at all. You can say that you personally think she was chosen because people thought she sounded similar to Johansson, even though there’s no evidence for that at this point. But the claim - which was made several times in discussions on here before - that she is a Johansson impersonator is factually incorrect. > But in my view, it requires a pretty absurd level of benefit of the doubt to think that they didn't set out to make a voice that sounds like the one from the movie. I tried it several times in the past and never once thought it sounded like Johansson. When this controversy came out I looked at videos of Her, because I thought Johansson could have been using a different voice in that movie, but no - the voice in her is immediately recognizable as Johannson’s. Some have said Sky’s was much closer to Rashida Jones, and I agree, though I don’t know how close. reply sanderjd 8 minutes agorootparentI think this is quibbling over the definition of \"impersonator\"? I think the most plausible thing that happened is that they thought \"hey it would be so awesome to have an AI voice companion like the one in Her, and we can totally do that with these new models\", and then auditioned and hired someone that sounded like that. Does it not fit the definition of \"impersonator\", since they didn't explicitly tell the person the hired to impersonate the voice from the movie? Sure, fine, I guess I'll give it to you. But it doesn't refute \"they wanted to use a voice that sounded like the one in Her\", and there are a number of indications the this was indeed the case.

The dispute is instead about statements just like your We don't know why Altman referenced \"Her\", which, on the one hand, you're right, the mind of another personally is technically unknowable, but on the other hand, no, that's total nonsense, we do indeed know exactly why he referenced the movie, because we're a social animal and we absolutely are frequently capable of reasoning out other people's motivations and intentions. This is not a court of law, we don't have a responsibility to suspend disbelief unless and until we see a piece of paper that says \"I did this thing for this reason\", we are free to look at a pattern of behavior and draw obvious conclusions. Indeed, if it were a court of law, that's still exactly what we'd be asked to do.

But I disagree that it is likely to be, in this specific case, and the other specific case you cited.

According to OAI's timeline, they intended to have Sky in addition to SJ. OAIs voice models including Sky predate the GPT4o voice assistant. Also: \"In a statement from the Sky actress provided by her agent, she wrote that at times the backlash “feels personal being that it’s just my natural voice and I’ve never been compared to her by the people who do know me closely.”\" It did not seem like an issue before and the Sky voice was public many months before GPT4o. I don't believe SJ can claim to own all young, attractive woman voices whether they are used as a voice assistant or not. It seems like the issue is being blown out of proportion. It does make a good story. The public perception of AI right now is generally negative and people are looking for reasons to disparage AI companies. Maybe there are good reasons sometimes, but this one is not it. reply throwup238 2 hours agorootparent> It seems like the issue is being blown out of proportion. It kinda feels like its on purpose. Someone in a previous thread mentioned that this might have been a cynical marketing ploy and I'm warming up to the theory. After they recorded the Sky VA, they figured out a whole marketing campaign with SJ to promote the voice feature. After she turned them down (twice), they released with just enough crumbs referencing the movie to goad SJ into committing a first degree Streisand. With the slow roll out, everyone would have forgotten about the feature the day after the announcement but now it's been in the news for a week, constantly reminding everyone of what's coming up. reply whilenot-dev 1 hour agorootparentCalling it a Streisand on behalf of SJ is wrong though. She wanted it to be a topic of discussion and succeeds with it. reply chung8123 2 hours agorootparentprevIn addition they have prepared for a full court case before hand, with all their ducks in a row in theory. I am not a lawyer so I am not sure if the law works this way but this might help them defend their case and set a precedence. reply spiralk 2 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds plausible actually. The controversy has given OAI free marketing. reply buu700 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm also curious, legally speaking, is it an issue even if Sky's actress does sound like Scarlett? What if OpenAI admits they intentionally chose someone who sounded like Scarlett? Does it matter whether she was using her natural speaking voice or intentionally mimicking Scarlett's voice and mannerisms? This seems similar to the latest season of Rick and Morty. Whether justified or not in that particular case, it rubs me the wrong way a bit in principle to think that a production can fire someone only to hire someone else to do a near-perfect copy of their likeness. If (as in the OpenAI case) they'd gone further and trained an AI on the impressions of Justin's voice, would that have been considered an AI impersonation of Justin with extra steps? All of which is to say, this seems like a pretty interesting legal question to me, and potentially broader than just AI. reply sowbug 1 hour agorootparentThe fired actor would have already signed away any claim to the character's likeness. The likeness the company cares about is that of the character, not of the actor portraying the character. The actor never owned the character, so the actor shouldn't be miffed that someone else gets the part for future performances. reply buu700 1 hour agorootparentThat's probably the case. Having said that, there are also a lot of one-off side characters which use Justin's distinctive voice style, although I can't remember specifically whether that was the case in the latest season, and I'm not aware that detailed information about their internal agreements is public knowledge either way. I was speaking more about the general principle, not strictly that particular situation. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like there are some interesting overlapping legal and moral dilemmas in all of the discussions about both situations, regardless of what the specific facts of the OpenAI and R&M cases may be. reply sowbug 27 minutes agorootparentYes, I can see a plausible argument that a character is so intertwined with a well-known real-life persona that a company can't replicate a character without borrowing some of the persona's value. One might also make the case that the actor developed so much depth in an initially thin character that they deserve more credit than just acting the part. I don't personally subscribe to the notion that the recent legal invention of intellectual property is a moral right. Capitalism has been doing just fine as a productivity motivator. We don't need to capitalize expression of ideas, let alone pure ideas. I accept the tradeoff of the temporary monopolies of copyright and patent, and I appreciate that trademark and trade secrets disincentivize bad behavior. But I have no desire to try to find new boxes to store new kinds of intellectual property, like Scarlett Johansson's right to monopolize performances of a character in an app that remind people of her performance of a character in a movie. Such a kind of property right is not necessary. reply vitaflo 1 hour agorootparentprevSee Midler vs Ford, Glover vs Universal or Stefani vs Activision for prior cases in this area. Courts usually side with the person being imitated. reply evrydayhustling 1 hour agorootparentprev\"SJ can't own all female AI voices\" is attacking a straw man version of the complaint, which is much narrower. The question is whether OpenAI deliberately fostered the impression of an association between their product and her performance, which she had so far refused. To your point, there have many female assistant voices on the market, including Sky -- but what might have tripped the line of impersonation was the context this particular one was presented and marketed. I don't know where exactly that line should be, but you can certainly reject this kind of marketing without stifling anybody's legitimate career. reply gunapologist99 2 hours agoparentprevRegardless of the moral implications, \"sounds almost exactly the same\" is not copyright infringement. Perhaps it could be trademark infringement if she had trademarked her voice like Harley-Davidson attempted (and failed) to trademark the sound of their motorcycles, but \"sounds alike\" is a pretty hard case to prove, and it's completely blown away if they can demonstrate that another human sounds indisputably similar. People do celebrity impressions all the time, and that's not infringement either, because it's not actually copying that person's voice. I'm sympathetic to SJ in this matter, especially after the Disney Black Widow debacle, but it sounds like she had the opportunity to write herself a nice check, and she turned it down. On the basis of this article, it sounds like she doesn't have the cause of action that she had believed she had; I imagine that her legal team are now advising a fast settlement, but OpenAI's legal team might prefer to milk the free publicity for as long as they can, especially if they are fairly certain they would prevail at trial. reply l33tman 1 hour agorootparentIt isn't about copyright, it's about passing-off, it's described elsewhere in detail in these threads what it means. It's about intention and what the customer believes. If customers might believe its SJ, due to samas tweets, general likeness in voice, and the context (voice assistant), the public info about them trying to get SJ to do this - that's passing-off, even if it wasn't training on her voice per se. There are numerous law cases about this. reply Athari 2 hours agorootparentprev> it sounds like she had the opportunity to write herself a nice check, and she turned it down. If I were SJ, I'd turn it down too. Shes in no need of money, and selling her voice to OpenAI would make most of creators and every single voice actor hate her (not to mention the Twitter mob). In majority of creative circles, the current social norm is to hate AI, so touching AI in any way is too risky for reputation. reply Wowfunhappy 10 minutes agoparentprevBut there's nothing wrong with this!

Lots of voice actors are capable of doing voices that sound like other people, and some even have a natural voice that happens to sound very similar to a particular more noteworthy celebrity. AFAIU, the rights to your likeness only apply to your likeness, not to the likeness of someone else who happens to look or sound a lot like you. For a case that doesn't involve AI at all, consider situations where a voice actor in a cartoon is replaced (sometimes while still alive) by someone who can perform a voice that sounds the same. Decisively not illegal. Most people don't even find it immoral, as long as the reason for getting rid of the original voice actor wasn't wrong on its own (e.g. Roiland). reply WalterBright 1 hour agorootparentThe attempts to sound like Mel Blanc after his death just don't sound right to me.

Right. And the question is, did they actually used SJ's voice as part of their training data? Because there's a lot of that available given all her works. There's a reason why they wanted 'her', specifically. What reason is that? If they could just work with a noname voice actress (likely, for far cheaper), why not just do that from the get go? It could be a marketing gimmick and maybe they wanted her name more than just the voice to add to the buzz. If it is not that, then the sequence of events doesn't make sense. reply chung8123 2 hours agoparentprevI would say that OpenAI wanted something that sounded like her which in turn sounded like Scarlett Johannson. I also think the \"sounded like\" is less clear than you think. Is it similar, yes. But how similar I am not sure what the line is but for sure I didn't think it was Scarlett Johannson. By saying it is Scarlett Johannson and relating it to her our brains will make the association though.

The OpenAI team are clearly well aware of Scarlett's voice (its inconceivable the majority of the team at OpenAI haven't at least seen part of the film that almost defined their industry). The movie predates all of this by years - of course they knew. When auditioning actors \"months before\" they can still look for an actor who guess what?

It was a somewhat popular movie, yes, but not really defining and far from the first example of conversational AI speaking woman's voice. There are plenty of examples in movies and TV shows. If anything, the seminal work in this space is Star Trek casting Majel Barrett-Roddenberry as the voice of computer systems with conversational interfaces, as early as 1987 (or 1986, if she had that role in the Original Series; I don't remember those episodes too well), all the way to ~2008 (or to 2023, if you count post-mortem use of her voice). That is one distinctive voice I'd expect people in OpenAI to be familiar with :). Also, I can't imagine most people knowing, or caring, who voiced the computer in Her. It's not something that most people care about, especially when they're more interested in the plot itself. reply sanderjd 55 minutes agorootparent> Let's not exaggerate.

The tweet doesn't even require additional context or explanation to almost anyone in this industry. There is also a clear difference in the behaviour of the \"computer\" in Star Trek vs \"her\" - what OpenAI shipped is far more like the personality of \"her\" than the much more straight-laced examples in Star Trek, where the computer was virtually devoid of emotional-sounding responses at all. reply JoeMattiello 1 hour agorootparentWho cares. reply goatlover 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat matters is whether OpenAI leadership had the movie Her in mind, and the AI in Her is more similar to LLMs than the Next Generation Star Trek main computer. reply WalterBright 1 hour agorootparentprevComputers have had conversational voices at least since Lost In Space. reply giobox 1 hour agorootparentI think we can surely all mostly agree 'her' presents a much more realistic portrayal of a near-term future than Lost in Space et al. reply asaxena76 3 hours agorootparentprevEven if thats true why would that be illegal or unethical?

If I heard both voices in a conversation, I would have thought 2 different people were talking. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparentTruthfully, you can no longer trust yourself (whichever side you're on in this debate). We're all now primed and we'll pick up any distinguishing characteristics. You'd have to listen to them in a blind test and do this with several clips that do not reveal which ones are OpenAI and which are from a movie or something else that spoils it. And I wouldn't put the metric at 50/50, needs to be indistinguishable. It would be a reasonable amount where it sounds __like__, which could be identifying the chatbot 100% of the time! (e.g. what if I just had a roboticized version of a person's voice) Truth is that I can send you clips of the same person[0], tell you they're different people, and a good portion of people will be certain that these are different people (maybe __you're different__™, but that doesn't matter). So use that as the litmus test in either way. Not if you think they are different, but rather \"would a reasonable person think this is supposed to sound like ScarJo?\" Not you, other people. Then, ask yourself if there was sufficient evidence that OpenAI either purposefully intended to clone her voice OR got so set in their ways (maybe after she declined, but had hyped themselves up) that they would have tricked themselves into only accepting a voice actor that ended up sounding similar. That last part is important because it shows how such a thing can happen without ever explicitly (and maybe even not recognizing themselves) stating such a requirement. Remember that us humans do a lot of subconscious processing (I have a whole other rant on people building AGI -- a field I'm in fwiw -- not spending enough time understanding their minds or the minds of animals). Edit: [0]I should add that there's a robustness issue here and is going to be a distinguishing factor for people determining if the voices are different. Without a doubt, those voices are \"different\" but the question is in what way. The same way someone's voice might change day to day? The difference similar to how someone sounds on the phone vs in person? Certainly the audio quality is different and if you're expecting a 1-to-1 match where we can plot waveforms perfectly, then no, you wouldn't ever be able to do this. But that's not a fair test reply causal 1 hour agorootparentprevI agree they don't sound the same. But, since it's a subjective test, OpenAI was pretty Twitter-foolish to push the \"Her\" angle after being explicitly rejected by SJ. It's just inviting controversy. reply barrell 3 hours agorootparentprevWithout commenting on the debate at large, it’s a bit funny to read this comment. I mean voice cloning a year or two ago was basically science fiction, now we’re talking about voices being distinguishable as proof it’s not cloned, sourced, or based on someone.

The details matter. There is absolutely enough vocal difference, it doesn't take an audiologist to hear the two voices do sound different but very close. It would not be hard for the producers to describe \"a\" voice and that description would overlap heavily with ScarJo, and wow the marketing team reached out to see if she would attempt to fill the existing requirements.

But this report from WaPo debunks at least some of it, because the records they have seen show that the voice actor was contacted months in advance prior to OpenAI contacting Scarlett for the first time. (also goes to show just how many months in advance OpenAI is working on projects) However, this does not dispel the fact that OpenAI did contact Scarlett, and Sam Altman did post the tweet saying \"her\", and the voice has at least \"some\" resemblance of Scarlett's voice, at least enough to have two different groups saying that it does, and the other saying that it does not. reply serial_dev 12 hours agoparentI don't know, to me, it's just sounds like they know how to cover all their bases.

They still liked it, so it was time to contact the real star. In the end, it's not just the voice, it would have been the brand, just imagine the buzz they would have got if Scarlett J was the official voice of the company. She said no, and they were like, \"too bad, we already decided how she will sound like, the only difference is whether it will be labelled as SJ or not\".

The only real, though partial, rebuttal to her is that OpenAI copied a work product she did for a movie, and the movie was was more than her voice, so it's not totally her own work. So maybe the movie team as a whole has a stronger complaint than the voice actor alone. She didn't lose any game of wits. She just got done dirty by someone who got away with it. She doesn't need money from them. She has respect from people who matter, SAM and OpenAI behaved badly like big tech always does.

It's not necessarily what will prove true at the end of the day but I think we owe people the presumption of innocence. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentI think we owe people outside of a commercial environment the presumption of innocence and benefit of the doubt. But we owe profit-seeking corporations (or their officers) neither, and the assumption should be that they are simply amorally doing whatever maximizes profit. As soon as someone hangs their shingle out there as a business, our presumptions should change. reply jrm4 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, you owe people that. No, you do not owe \"corporations, especially those with a tendency, incentive, and history of being ruthless in this way.\" Wise up, people. reply rangerelf 4 hours agorootparentprevIs it necessarily a bad bias to assume OpenAI is still behaving as it's been behaving during its entire history: recklessly taking other people's IP? reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentYes, because the courts have yet to decide whether OpenAI has been \"recklessly taking other people's IP\" in an illegal way. Right now, it's only something believed by people who wish it to be true; legally, it's not clear just yet. In contrast, actually doing SJ impersonation here would be a much clearer violation. There's a huge gap between the two deeds, and I don't see the reason to just assume OpenAI crossed it. It's like, the people dropping leaflets in your physical mailbox are delivering spam, but you wouldn't automatically assume those same people are also trying to scam you and your neighbors by delivering you physical letters meant to trick people into parting with their savings. In both cases, the messages are spam, but one is legal, other is not, and there's a huge gap between them. reply glenstein 4 hours agorootparentprevI think the way I would split the difference here is that your point should inform how we think about regulation and investigation. How we write rules, how we decide to proceed in terms of investigating things. But when it comes to specific questions that hinge on evidence, I think you have to maintain the typical presumption of innocence, just to balance out the possibilities of mob psychology getting out of control. reply KHRZ 3 hours agorootparentprevBecause it follows the legal principle of innocent untill proven guilty?

This kind of thing is already illegal. If I’m producing a commercial for Joe’s Hot Dogs, and I hire a voice actor who sounds like Morgan Freeman, and he never says “I’m Morgan Freeman” but he’s the main voice in the commercial and the cartoon character he’s voicing looks like Morgan Freeman… well, many consumers will be confused into thinking Morgan Freeman likes Joe’s Hot Dogs, and that’s a violation of Morgan Freeman’s trademark. reply throwawaymaths 4 hours agorootparentno, that's definitely not illegal. Voices are not trademarkable, only jingles (melody, words + tone), and of course specific recordings of voices are copyrighted. The ONLY way they get in trouble is if they claim to be Morgan Freeman. reply dragonwriter 23 minutes agorootparent> Voices are not trademarkable But they are subject to right of publicity in many US jurisdictions. Which, while more like trademark than copyright (the other thing that keeps getting raised as if it should dispose of this issue), is its own area of law, distinct from either trademark or copyright. > The ONLY way they get in trouble is if they claim to be Morgan Freeman. That’s…not true. Though such an explicit claim would definitely be a way that they could get in trouble. reply zerocrates 4 hours agorootparentprev\"Trademark\" is not the correct way to talk about it, but commercial use of an impersonation can be a breach of the right of publicity, even if they don't actually say they're the person. reply thehappypm 4 hours agorootparentprevA reasonable person would assume that the voice in the commercial is Morgan Freeman, which could be very problematic for the commercial maker. reply fakedang 3 hours agorootparentprevVoices may not be trademarkable but I'm pretty sure styles and intonations are. reply nilamo 4 hours agorootparentprevWhich part of that is illegal?

Ford asked Midler to use her voice in ads. After she declined, Ford hired an impersonator. The U.S. appellate courts ruled in Midler’s favor, indicating her voice was protected against unauthorized use. reply m348e912 3 hours agorootparentThere's a gray area. If Ford Motor Company hired an actor happened to sound a lot like Bette Midler using their normal speaking voice, Ford would have had a much better chance in defending their case. As I understand it, that's essentially OpenAI's defense here. reply nilamo 3 hours agorootparentprevSo if I happen to sound like Tom Hanks, anyone recording me in passing would be breaking the law? How does anyone see that as reasonable? reply pnt12 3 hours agorootparentThat's a bit of a strawman: you're twisting the scope and arguing for it. A more similar context would be: they ask Tom Hanks to create a voice similar to Woody, the cowboy from Toy Story . Tom Hanks says no, Disney says no. Then they ask you to voice their cowboy voice. It's obviously related: they tried the OG, failed, they're going for a copycat after. But if never approached Tom Hanks or Disney, then there would be room for deniability - without mentions to real names, it would require someone to judge if it's an unauthorized copycat or just a random actor voicing a random cowboy voice.

Take any animated film that get a TV show spinoff, their voice actors get replaced all the time, and I really can’t imagine that spinoff tv shows are dependent on getting all the original voice actors to grant permission. How many different actors have voiced looney toons characters over the years? Didn’t Ernie Hudson audition to play his own character for the Ghost Busters cartoon and lose out to someone else? And these are all cases where there is clear intent to sound as close to the original actor as possible. reply Uehreka 1 hour agorootparentI Am Not An Entertainment Lawyer either, so I can’t answer with too much certainty, but I’d suspect the actors have a clause in the contract they sign allowing the character to be played by someone else post-contract. Think about how many clauses were in the last employment contract you signed. reply stale2002 2 hours agorootparentprevOk got it. So in your opinion, if a movie needs to have a tall, skinny red head, and then they approach someone who has those qualities and the role is turned down, then it would be illegal to get any other different tall skinny red head. That sounds absurd to me. If you have a role, obviously the role has qualities and requirements. And just because person 1 who happens to have those qualities turns you down, it is still valid to get a different person who fulfils your original requirements. reply Uehreka 1 hour agorootparentYeah I think the person you’re responding to gave a bad example.

They had to have a model of her ready to go when they asked her for permission immediately before launching; possibly they had one that had been built from her, and another legal-approved that they had converged to be close to the first one but that didn't include her as a direct source. reply TerrifiedMouse 4 hours agorootparentprevRight of publicity.

I said that the legality of that is more complicated. What jorvi describes might or might not be illegal based on various factors. And I pointed them towards the two references to support my argument. I explicitly didn't say in that comment anything about the OpenAI/ScarJo case. You are reacting as if you think that I have some opinion about it. You are wrong, and it would be better if you would not try to guess my state of mind. If I have some opinion about something you will know because I will explicitly state it. reply Matticus_Rex 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is correct, and is very different from both the Midler and Waits cases.

The actor sounds somewhat different from Johansson but the delivery of the lines is similar. (2) They then ask Johansson because they want to be the company that brought “Her” to life. She declines. (3) They try again shortly before the event because they really want it to happen. (4) They proceed with the original voice, and the “her” tweet happens because they want to be the ones that made it real. Asking shortly before the release is the weakest link here. It’s possible they already had a version trained or fine tuned on her voice that they could swap in at the last minute. That could explain some of the caginess. Not saying it’s what happened or is even likely, but it feels like a reasonable possibility. reply pavon 2 hours agorootparentMy unsubstantiated theory: They have a voice trained on Johansson's body of work ready to go, but didn't release it because they didn't get her permission. This explains why they were still asking her right up to the ChatGPT-4o release. Then people (including Johansson) associate this Sky voice with Johansson and Her. OpenAI realizes it looks bad, despite not being intentional, so they pull Sky for PR reasons. reply stingraycharles 12 hours agoparentprevYes, but it changes the narrative from “they couldn’t get Scarlett to record the voice, so they copied her voice” to something much less malicious. Contacting Scarlett, when you already have voice recordings ready but would prefer someone famous, isn’t that bad of a thing imho. reply tivert 12 hours agorootparentnext [9 more] > Yes, but it changes the narrative from “they couldn’t get Scarlett to record the voice, so they copied her voice” to something much less malicious. I don't think it's less malicious if they decided to copy her voice without her consent, but just didn't tell her until the project was underway, then continued even after she said no. There's legal precedent that hiring a copycat is not OK, so it's not like proving it was a copycat salvages their situation. I wouldn't be surprised if the real reason they hired a copycat early is because they realized they'd need far more of Johansson's time than she'd be willing to provide, and the plan was typical SV \"ask forgiveness not permission, but do it anyway regardless.\" reply MattGaiser 12 hours agorootparentThey used a different person, so it is not her voice. reply tivert 12 hours agorootparent> They used a different person, so it is not her voice.

If you hired the woman who voiced Sky to say lines that Scarlett had in some of her movies, that would be similar. The fact that this is a chatbot makes it somewhat of an echo of those cases, but it strikes me (a former lawyer) as being a bridge too far. After all, you have to balance Scarlett's rights against the rights of someone who happens to have a voice that sounds like Scarlett's (it would be different if this were someone doing an impersonation of Scarlett, but whose natural voice sounds different). reply lupusreal 2 hours agorootparentTom Waits sued Frito Lay for using an impersonator to sing about Doritos. reply avar 7 hours agorootparentprevFord commissioned a cover of a 1958 song[1] using a singer that would clearly be mistaken for Bette Midler's existing cover of that song, as part of an advertisement campaign where they first tried to get the rights to the original songs. If you listen to the imitation version linked from that Wikipedia article and the original 1958 you'll hear that they didn't only find a singer that sounded like her, but copied the music and cadence from Bette's version. I think that's way past what whatever OpenAI did in this case. It would be analogous if they were publishing something that only regurgitated lines Scarlett Johansson is famous for having said in her movies.

Please visit the WinDirStat blog for more up-to-date information about the program. On start up, it reads the whole directory tree once and then presents it in three useful views: The directory list, which resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer but is sorted by file/subtree size, The treemap, which shows the whole contents of the directory tree straight away, The extension list, which serves as a legend and shows statistics about the file types. The treemap represents each file as a colored rectangle, the area of which is proportional to the file's size. The rectangles are arranged in such a way, that directories again make up rectangles, which contain all their files and subdirectories. So their area is proportional to the size of the subtrees. The color of a rectangle indicates the type of the file, as shown in the extension list. The cushion shading additionally brings out the directory structure. WinDirStat is Open Source software.

Maybe there's no downside but it's such a huge speed boost that it would be weird to not use it otherwise, right? reply becurious 5 hours agorootparentAlong with the reasons others have mentioned, it would also bypass any filter driver in the file system stack (Windows has the concept of a stack of filter drivers that can sit in front of the file system or hardware) and would also ignore any permissions (ACLs) on who can see those files. There’s no way they can credibly use this technique outside of say something from SysInternals: it violates the security and layering of the operating system and its APIs. reply mardifoufs 2 hours agorootparentIs there a Linux equivalent for those \"filters\"? I'm a bit clueless about win32 and NT sadly enough... Would that mean that there's no way to \"scope\" the MFTs? Edit: That also makes sense, since if I got it right they aren't necessarily supposed to be consumed by userspace programs? I guess that's why those tools always ask for admin access and basically all perms to the FS. It's a bit sad that the user gets exposed to a much slower search and FS experience even if the system underneath has the potential to be as fast as it gets. And I don't think ReFS is intended to replace NTFS (not that it's necessarily more performant anyways) reply wongarsu 2 hours agorootparentThere is no equivalent on Linux. That's why linux has no online antivirus scanners (scanners that scan the file as it's opened) while this is a basic feature of every antivirus program on Windows. Linux has device mappers (dm-crypt, dm-raid and friends). But those sit below the file system, emulating a device. Window's file system filter drivers sit above the file system, intercepting API calls to and from the file system. That's super useful if you want to check file contents on access, track where files are going, keep an audit log of who accessed a file, transparently encrypt single files instead of whole volumes, etc. But you pay the price for all that flexibility in performance. reply SSLy 36 minutes agorootparentWhat are the APIs related to this named? reply mastax 6 minutes agorootparentIO Minifilter drivers are the modern version: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/i...

E.g. in Linux you might have files in /d1/d2/{f1,f2,f3} in the root filesystem but you also have a mountpoint of a 2nd filesystem on /d1/d2 that completely changes the visibility / contents of d2.

Why doesn't Microsoft do it in file explorer, and why wouldn't every tool use it instead of walking through the file system? One disadvantage is that you can't read the MFT of network shares or device emulators presenting \"virtual drive letters\" to the OS. The typical (and slower) Win32 API functions FindFirstFile()/FindNextFile() used to iterate through the files structure work at a higher level of abstraction so they work on more targets that don't have an NTFS MFT. Indeed, if you point WizTree to a SMB network share, it will be a lot slower because it can't directly read the MFT. It's conceivable that Microsoft developers could have programmed Windows Explorer differently to have an optimized code path of reading MFT for local disks and then fall back to slower FindFirstFile()/FindNextFile() for non-MFT disks. Maybe that adds too much complexity and weird bugs.

If this didn’t work securely then it wouldn’t be possible to implement disk defragmenter or even explorer. It’s so core to Windows NT’s security model that I wouldn’t call it a workaround. You do similar things even with more modern stacks - assign a permission to an application and grant permissions to the application to the user. The only real concern is that Windows NT permissions are not as granular as they could be. reply mananaysiempre 1 hour agorootparent> Windows NT permissions are not as granular as they could be. For objects, Windows NT permissions are ridiculously granular; e.g. GENERIC_WRITE can be mapped to a half-dozen separately settable type-specific flags, depending on the object type (file, named pipe, etc.). It’s too granular for even an administrator to make sense of, arguably, and the documentation is somewhere between bad and nonexistent. (The UI varies from decent, like the ACL editor you can access from e.g. Explorer, to “you can’t make this shit up”, like SDDL[1].) For subjects, the situation is not good, like on every other conventional OS. You could deal with that by introducing a “user” for each app, as on Android. But I’m not aware of any attempts to do that (that would expose this mechanism in a user-visible way). (Then there’s the UWP sandbox, which as far as I tell is build with complete disregard of the fundamental concepts above. I don’t think it’s worth taking seriously at this time.)

One possible reason is that it isn't a published part of the filesystem's external interface, and the format is not guaranteed to be static between versions or even point releases (though in reality, while the behaviours may be officially undefined that are unlikely to change significantly). Also, it requires admin elevation to access. Anything running elevated is a potential security concern as it can access much else too. > Why doesn't Microsoft do it in file explorer Not sure, but it could be because that would be seen as an unfair advantage so to avoid anti-trust allegations they would have to publish the format and make stability guarantees for it, so others could use it as easily/safely. That, and the reasons above & below too. > and why wouldn't every tool use it instead of walking through the file system? Largely because walking the filesystem works for all filesystems, local and remote, so you cover everything with one tree walk implementation. Implementing a tree-walk over the MFT data where available is extra work to implement and support for one filesystem, and not many care enough, or are not aware of the potential speed benefit at all, for it to be a huge selling point such that all toolmakers feel compelled to bother. reply WaitWaitWha 5 hours agorootparent> One possible reason is that it isn't a published part of the filesystem's external interface, and the format is not guaranteed to be static between versions or even point releases (though in reality, while the behaviours may be officially undefined that are unlikely to change significantly).

Navigating the directory view highlights the corresponding area on the tree map. Files are color coded according to their type. reply tylervigen 2 hours agoprevI have used WinDirStat for years. It's not perfect, but it solves my use case very well. My use case is just: my disk is full, I don't know why. This happens on one of my computers like once a year, so the fact that it's slow is fine. It usually helps me spot some folder set that is taking up a lot of space that I don't need on that PC, or something large that is duplicated. My personal favorite example is wedding photos and videos. Turns out: those are huge, I am not going to delete them, but they don't need to be backed up on every computer I own. reply LeoPanthera 12 hours agoprevI like \"ncdu\", a TUI equivalent for Unixy systems. Although I learned the hard way that if you run it on a Mac home folder, and have iCloud's \"optimize Mac storage\" turned on, macOS will suddenly try to download literally everything in your iCloud storage to try to count the size of it, probably filling your disk. Oops. reply angch 10 hours agoparentThere's also \"diskonaut\", a TUI which displays the output like the treemap of WinDirStat. Bonus is that the display is incremental and updates as it scans everything, so you don't need to wait for the complete scan to see how everything looks like. Written in Rust, and it's a `cargo install diskonaut` away if you have the rust toolchain installed. reply qwertox 8 hours agoparentprev`ncdu` has the `-x` flag which means that \"Only count files and directories on the same filesystem as the specified dir.\".

Any flavor you like: lists (diskwave, omnidisk), treemaps (GrandPerspective), pie charts (DiskSavvy), sunburst (baobab), icicle, etc. The two winning visualization types are sunburst and treemaps. Both have their own cons and pros, but in our tests user sunburst performed slightly better for regular users. My personal bet is that no disk space analyzing tool's developer took it seriously or tried to actually advance the algorithms. Most of the apps I know use quite straightforward implementation and haven't been touched for years. Guess a little bit of filtering, grouping and changing coloring algorithms could significantly improve the treemap's perception, but someone has to do the job. disclaimer: I'm the original designer of DaisyDisk. reply Brajeshwar 1 hour agoparentHey, your DaisyDisk UI gets stolen for Movies and stuff.

Microsoft outage started at approximately 3 AM EDT and seems to have primarily affected users in Asia and Europe. According to user reports and our tests, if you try to open Bing.com, you'll either see a blank page or a page with a 429 HTTP code error. However, Bing search still works if accessed directly. For some reason, the outage only affects the homepage.Bing and Copilot office Source: BleepingComputer To use Bing, go to this URL and search as usual. It will work. However, Copilot is completely offline whether you use the website, app, or Copilot in Windows. It's also important to note that ChatGPT internet search and DuckDuckGo are experiencing similar issues because they use the Bing API.DuckDuckGo refuses to load search pages, displaying an error message: \"There was an error displaying the search results. Please try again.\" While Microsoft has yet to comment on the outage, OpenAI confirmed issues with ChatGPT internet search in an update on its support page. This is a developing story... Update 1: Microsoft has confirmed an issue where users may be unable to access the Microsoft Copilot service. \"We're working to isolate the cause of the issue. More information can be found in the admin center under CP795190,\" the company noted in a post on X. Update 2: DuckDuckGo is back online, but Bing.com and Copilot are still having issues. In a new update, Microsoft added that it continues to isolate the root cause and \"transitioning requests to alternate service components to expedite service recovery.\"Related Articles: Microsoft's new Windows 11 Recall is a privacy nightmareWindows 11 24H2 now rolling out to Release Preview InsidersMicrosoft Edge update starts disabling Internet Explorer 11 todayWindows 11 Recall AI feature will record everything you do on your PCMicrosoft to start enforcing Azure multi-factor authentication in July freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"bleepingcomputer_728x90_320x50_InContent_1\", slotId: \"bleepingcomputer_728x90_320x50_InContent_1\" });Bing ChatGPT Copilot DuckDuckGo MicrosoftMayank ParmarMayank Parmar is an technology entrepreneur who is currently pursuing an MBA.

    "originBody": "The Space Quest II Master Disk Blunder May 22, 2024 There is nothing unusual about the outside of these disks, but there is something unique about the data that is stored on them, something that Sierra On-Line would have been totally unaware of and certainly wouldn’t have wanted them to include. If you happen to have one of these 720KB floppy disks lurking somewhere in your Sierra adventure game collection, then chances are you are not alone. Versions 2.0D and 2.0F of Space Quest II were not exactly uncommon. A simple directory listing Listing the files on the disk doesn’t reveal anything unusual: The listing shown is from version 2.0D. There are no mysterious additional files, in fact it looks like any other Sierra game disk. Nothing is out of place. The timestamps show that the game’s main data files, i.e. PICDIR, LOGDIR, VIEWDIR, SNDDIR, VOL.0 and VOL.1, were built on the 14th March 1988. The .OVL files are dated the 15th March 1988, and the AGI interpreter code itself is dated the 18th March 1988. These file timestamps capture a week of activity during which someone in the Sierra office was focused on preparing the 2.0D version of Space Quest II. One thing that is a little curious about the directory listing above is that the “free” space on the disk is greater than the used space. 302,918 bytes are used and 402,432 bytes are supposedly free. Using a hex editor To take a closer look at what is on the disk, and to peek into that supposedly unused part, we need a tool called a hex editor. Back in the 1980s, a commonly used tool for this came with Norton Utilities. These days a great modern equivalent is the excellent HxD Hex Editor written by Maël Hörz. For a freshly formatted DOS floppy disk, we’d expect all of the unused sectors to be filled with the 0xF6 byte value (i.e. DOS’s default format ‘filler’ byte), which is indeed the case for Disk 2 of Space Quest II version 2.0D, as shown below: There isn’t, however, a single unused sector on Disk 1 that is filled with the 0xF6 byte, in fact the longest string of consecutive 0xF6 bytes on Disk 1 is only two. Given that over half the disk is “free” space, then clearly the disk had not been formatted prior to being prepared as a SQ2 master disk. The following shows an example of a section of the SQ2 Disk 1 disk that is marked as unused: Rather than being filled with the 0xF6 byte, it is instead filled with something that looks like C source code. This strongly suggests that the master disk was used for some other purpose prior to being the SQ2 Disk 1 master disk. The files were then deleted, but the disk was not properly formatted afterwards. Due to the way the DOS FAT file system works, deleting a file does not actually remove the data. Instead it simply marks the sectors as no longer being in use, so that in the future they could be used for a new file. If those sectors are never used again for a new file, then they will keep what they previously had stored on them, and so it was important that people fully formatted a floppy disk after storing sensitive files on them. AGI interpreter source code It is difficult to see exactly what the above data looks like when viewed in a hex editor, but it clearly looks like text, so let’s copy and paste the ASCII text on the right hand side into a text editor to see what we have: As we can see, it certainly does look like C source code. There are two functions defined, one called DisplayStatusLine and another called StatusLineOn. In the case of DisplayStatusLine, it appears to be displaying a line of text that includes the current score and whether the sound is on or off. Does this look familiar? You bet it does. Take a look at the top of the Space Quest II screen shot below: That particular piece of C source code is responsible for displaying the white status bar at the top of the game screen, with the black text that shows the user what their current score is. This source code is a part of the AGI interpreter itself! This is just one small example. Scrolling through more of the unused sectors in the hex editor reveals that there is a large amount of such source code. Not only that but the code is stored over consecutive sectors, i.e. it is not fragmented as you might expect, so it is relatively easy to extract this data from the disk and then split it up into separate C source files. The split points are easy to determine, since each file has a comment at the top saying what the name of the source file is. Splitting into the separate files gives us 93 files in total, made up of 75 C source files, 16 assembly language source files, and 2 DOS BAT files: In total, there are over 15000 lines of code and most of these files are complete. It turns out that this Space Quest 2 game disk contains about 70% of the source code of Sierra On-Line’s AGI interpreter, complete with comments and change history. We will look at how that 70% figure was calculated later in the article. When we say “the AGI interpreter”, what we are referring to is the file named “AGI” in the directory listing that was shown earlier, along with the the .OVL files. The “AGI” file is the executable that performs the actual interpretation of the game data contained in the LOGDIR, PICDIR, VIEWDIR, SNDDIR, OBJECT, WORDS.TOK and VOL files. Source file change history Some of the source files contain a change history within the header comment at the top. The following is an example from the ANIMATE.C source file: The header comment starts by stating the name of the source file. It then gives a short description of what it does, in this case to “Handle one cycle of animation in an adventure game”. Next we have a line that says “compile: MWC”. This appears to state the name of the C compiler that was used to compile the C source. MWC was a C compiler from the Mark Williams company that was very popular in those days. After that, the header has a “Change History” section and this makes for very interesting reading. It mentions the date, time, initials of the person making the change, and a description of the change. The programmers have identied themselves using their initials, including their middle name initial. JAS is none other than Jeff Stephenson, the main programmer who was working on the AGI interpreter code, and DCI is Chris Iden. If you look at the game credits for the AGI games from 1985-89, you will see that Jeff and Chris were always credited with working on the game development system. Robert Heitman is also listed, but his focus was mainly on the graphics tools (i.e. the Picture Editor (PE) and View Editor (VE)), whereas Jeff and Chris worked primarily on the interpreter code. So it isn’t surprising to see their initials in the change history for the C source code of the AGI interpreter. AGI.EXE memory map In addition to the 93 AGI interpreter source code files, the SQ2 2.0D 720KB Disk 1 disk also contains over 2000 lines of a Memory Map of the AGI.EXE executable. For production releases of AGI games, the interpreter executable is called simply AGI, and is not directly executable, but during the development of the games, Sierra On-Line used a version of the interpreter that had the .EXE extension and could be run directly. Someone at Sierra generated a memory map of the AGI.EXE executable, i.e. the AGI interpreter, on the 7th October 1987. A small section of it is shown below: This gives a potential date to the collection of source code files. It ties in with the most recent change history comment in the code, which is from September 1987. The memory map also gives us a fairly complete list of the modules and source files that make up the AGI interpreter. Each module specifies the file that it is defined in. If we count the number of distinct source files mentioned, it comes to 98. The number of those source files that are present in full on the SQ2 disk is 71. This is where we get the figure of roughly 70% for the amount of AGI interpreter source code that is on the SQ2 disk. For some of the modules, only the C header file is included, and so those modules are not included in this calculation. Sierra’s intellectual property In 1984, Sierra On-Line was lucky to survive as a business. Some time around the release of King’s Quest, in May/June of that year, Ken Williams had to lay off around 100 of his employees, reducing the head count from approximately 130 down to about 30. Although it was a struggle, part of what turned their fortunes around was the success of the AGI adventure game system and the games that were built using it. By the end of 1984, King’s Quest had entered the top 20 on the software sales charts for computer games. It would stay there for the next half year, right up until the release of King’s Quest II, and it wasn’t long until King’s Quest II was also in the charts. This was helped a lot by the deal that Sierra made with Tandy Radio Shack to sell Tandy versions of the games in the Radio Shack stores. The AGI games continued to be best sellers from 1985 to 1988. Over those years, the AGI interpreter was Sierra On-Line’s primary means of making money and therefore a core part of their intellectual property. They not only invented the 3D animated graphic adventure game genre but also had a head start on their competitors that lasted several years. It is safe to say that the source code for the AGI interpreter is something that Sierra would have preferred didn’t fall into the hands of their competitors. For 70% of the source code to end up being copied en masse and sent out to tens, if not hundreds of thousands of their customers, was a big blunder. How did this happen? When a new release version of a game was prepared by Sierra, it involved creating a “production copy” master disk to be used by the FormMaster disk duplication machine. This machine did not simply copy files from the the master disk to each copy but instead copied every byte of every sector of the disk, regardless of whether the sectors were currently being used or not. What this meant in the case of the version 2.0D and 2.0F SQ2 Disk 1 disks is that it also copied the supposedly unused 402,432 bytes, despite there being no reason to. This is why the preparation of a master disk involved ensuring that it started out fully formatted before the game was copied on to it, and for the most part, Sierra On-Line got this step right. Most original Sierra game disks were formatted before use. It would seem that someone forgot to do this for the Space Quest II version 2.0D Disk 1 disk, and the same disk was then also used for version 2.0F of SQ2. This meant that potentially hundreds of thousands of SQ2 disks sent to customers and retail stores had a copy of 70% of the AGI interpreter source code hidden on them. Dodged a bullet It was almost certainly an unintentional mistake. Surprisingly, no one appeared to have noticed that this happened, not Sierra, not their competitors or their customers, and it was only discovered decades later, the first known discovery of it by online user NewRisingSun in October 2016. It is also fortuitous that this happened at the end of the AGI era. In March 1988, Sierra had already developed their SCI adventure game system and were about to release the first game using it, which would be King’s Quest IV. So “losing” the AGI interpreter source code into the public domain, should someone have noticed it, may not have been the issue it could have been only a year or two before that. It makes for an interesting digital archeaology story though, and it allows us, 36 years later, to see how our heros at Sierra On-Line wrote their AGI interpreter. For those who are interested, I have uploaded the extracted AGI interpreter source code into a github repo: https://github.com/lanceewing/agi Check out AGILE, the web based AGI interpreter, whose implementation was guided in part by the original AGI source code. « AGILE - Celebrating 40 years of King's Quest",

If your game doesn't fit in a power of 2, you have to pay more to get the bigger one (and maybe even a lot more if you also need to include a mapper, plus using a mapper means you've got to adjust your code and what not). But if you're using 75% of your quantized space, you don't need to be that picky. reply bryanlarsen 40 minutes agorootparentThe last time I built a ROM (in the 90's) it had 7 free bytes of space. That was not a coincidence. It was larger than that and then optimized until it hit a nice power of two and then I stopped optimizing. reply jpsouth 2 hours agoparentprevThis might be a silly question, but how does this even happen? I would have thought they’d finalise the game, get a ‘master’ of sorts and then send it to a mass production facility - how would the deleted archive end up on the master? Did they accidentally copy it over, then remove it before shipping? Edit: definitely should have read the comments here before adding my own! reply MenhirMike 2 hours agorootparentYeah, Duplication Houses usually duplicate the disk sector-by-sector, instead of on a file system level. (This makes a lot of sense, because it allowed the disk to contain any file system). But that also means that data that was still on the physical sectors of the disk got copied as well, regardless of whether the file system on the disk was still referencing that data. reply Rinzler89 2 hours agorootparent>Yeah, Duplication Houses usually duplicate the disk sector-by-sector I think they went even deeper. From the vintage computing nerds I saw on YouTuber, I think the duplication houses were replicating the raw magnetic flux off the disks as-is, since game studios were implementing some crafty low level anti-piracy measures on the golden disks to ensure that if you did sector level copies at home you wouldn't be able to run the game. reply EvanAnderson 1 hour agorootparentI wonder if anybody ever made an analog flux reversal-level disk copier out of consumer floppy drives. I'm not an electronics person but it sounds like it would something like a \"dubbing\" tape deck. Provided the reading and writing drives' spindle motors and heads were synchronized (which, presumably, could be done with an encoder on the reading drive) I would think it would be a fairly simple device. All the analog circuitry for reading and writing would be in an off-the-shelf floppy drive. reply MenhirMike 1 hour agorootparentI'm not aware of any direct copier, most disk duplicators that were sold to regular people were just a bunch of floppy drives with regular disk copy software. These days, there is the delightfully named Greaseweazle (https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle) and similar devices to _read_ disks at a magnetic level, but I'm not sure if there is something to _write_ disks. I don't see any reason why such a thing couldn't exist, I'm just not aware of it.

During my teenage years I used to listen to the same songs over and over on my walkman. I still remember 99% lyrics to the whole albums. The music used to have such a strong connection. Nowadays there are 1000+ songs in my playlist I can't even recollect 20% lyrics nor there is a chance in hell that I would listen to every single song on the entire album let alone every single song by tthe same artist. It's like if I don't like the first 10 seconds, it's hide song and Spotify makes sure I never have to listen to that again. Even though some of my all time favorites are songs I hated at first but then there was no hide song button. Sorry I digress but yeah the connections you make in childhood are really something. I just hope it's my age and not the technology responsible for this and the youth of today feel the same connection too. reply TillE 2 hours agoprevI don't think there's any particular secret sauce in the AGI engine, such that competitors would benefit from a leak. There are probably other examples I can't think of, but Hugo's House of Horrors was basically an AGI-style game made by one guy just a few years later. Beyond the initial novelty of a graphical adventure, Sierra games worked because they put a ton of effort into creating those graphics and actually writing the game. The tech isn't nothing, but it's a small fraction of the end product. reply Dwedit 2 hours agoprevThe Famicom version of Air Fortress has a ridiculously large amount of stuff unintentionally making it into the ROM. There is some uncompiled ASM code in there, some MS-DOS directory listings, some text strings from one of the EXEs used to build the game, and even more. The Japanese cartridge was 128+128KB large. Then they built the US NES version. Most of the 128K of graphics data was duplicate graphics, or unused. There was about 36KB of actual unique graphics. They shrunk the graphics down to 32KB by removing an image of a planet from one of the endings, and shipped it on a 128+32KB cartridge instead of a 128+128KB cartridge.

Back then, we could only afford to make an update once. When you mailed out the update disk, you had to charge for it ($10 or so, disk, mailing container, printed instructions, postage, and label); if you sent out 100k bad disks, you had to eat $1M. If it was version 1.0, it went into a box and was shipped to distributors, retailers, and mail-order, and you might never even know who the end user was. reply mmahemoff 2 hours agoprevMy favourite part is no-one apparently discovered the source code sitting on the disk for an entire generation. “Surprisingly, no one appeared to have noticed that this happened, not Sierra, not their competitors or their customers, and it was only discovered decades later, the first known discovery of it by online user NewRisingSun in October 2016.” Reminds me of the recent breakthroughs in Tetris and Super Mario Bros. When I played these games as a kid, I would have thought they’d be forgotten relics decades later, impossible for anyone but the most dedicated hobbyist to stand up and run, let alone keep learning new things about them. The internet and emulators breathed new life into those earlier games and computing. reply LaundroMat 2 hours agoparentI guess your last sentence answers your question. I'm sure some people had found the deleted files, but because that would before the internet was ubiquitous, it was not generally known or recorded. reply lance_ewing 1 hour agorootparentYeah, this could well be true. I was using a Hex Editor a lot back in the late 80s and early 90s, and that involved many of the Sierra games. Most of the time I was looking at the files installed on a hard disk though, as I generally installed the game from the floppy to the hard disk first and assumed I had everything. I think it would have been rare for me to be viewing the whole floppy disk of a Sierra game sector by sector in a Hex Viewer, although I did do that a lot for some disks.

I for one think it's a feature to have stories competing for the reader's attention and just take their time to bubble up to the front page. And this is quite an interesting story. Since the Sierra games' source code was never publicly released, it makes me think how radical id were to open source their games at the time, in the 90's. reply me_again 2 hours agoprevI sometimes wonder about the commercial impact of source code leaks. In this case, nobody noticed until the product was commercially irrelevant, but what might have happened if some competitor had noticed? My guess is probably nothing. Having the interpreter source code is a liability for other companies in case of an infringement lawsuit. Are there good examples where a source code leak actually led to significant consequences for a company? reply ryandrake 1 hour agoparentMy hunch is that companies tend to be paranoid and vastly overestimate the commercial importance of their source code. Are there really that many realistic opportunities to copy secrets from one mature source tree to another and commercially benefit from it? These code bases are likely totally different, use different design patterns, different internal APIs, data models are different, maybe even different languages. Anyone who has done integration work between two totally foreign-to-each-other code bases knows that the integration effort is often greater than just writing the code from scratch. The biggest risk is probably someone getting their hands on the entire project, including code, art assets, build infrastructure, and just compiling an identical program to release under their own name. But that would be obvious and probably easy to prove/litigate. reply MenhirMike 2 hours agoprevIt did apparently happen with quite a few games, where the Master Disk wasn't a brand new disk but some random disk that someone formatted and sent over to duplication. There are other games where cut content or early source code was recovered that way because the duplication house didn't work on a file system level but duplicated the entire disk as-is. reply JohnFen 2 hours agoprevStill not as bad as when a company I worked for managed to press and ship a ton of CDs that included a virus. reply MenhirMike 1 hour agoparentStill could be worse.

After 800 of them arrived for me to start mailing out, they found a small issue with the game, which they patched - \"don't worry the kids will just have to run the patch the first time they play\" - I tested it, the patch was 800MB...

I think part of the issue was there was not system to 'patch' - so the far larger download in theory allowed them to add smaller patches to the game in the future, but that didn't happen as far as I remember. I don't think we even ended up opening all the levels of the game as the uptake wasn't that great. reply boricj 1 hour agoprevBack when release artifacts were hand crafted, these often contained leftovers that weren't meant to be shipped, like cut content [1] or debugging symbols [2].

For copy protection, NevrLock and CrackAid. I still encounter DOS malware and a lack of proper cracking in some poor quality releases on the interwebs. For archival purposes, it's generally better to buy several physical copies of a game and Greaseweazle it and end up with at least 1 complete and unspoiled version. reply jandrese 2 hours agoprevI wonder if this is the only copy of that source code that survives? It's extremely common for source code from that era to be lost to time, especially from defunct companies.

I have found part of the AGI interpreter source code on a King's Quest III disk (version 2.14, 720KB version, disk 1). There is nowhere near as much, but lucky for us, it happens to include a few complete files that were not on the SQ2 disk. So that increases the total amount of source a bit. I have checked other Sierra disks, and so far the SQ2 and KQ3 occurrences are the only ones I know of. reply olliej 1 hour agoprevNot sure this would have counted as “losing it to the public domain” - accidentally leaking the sources doesn’t negate copyright (presumably just trade secrets stuff by Iqbal) reply rietta 2 hours agoprevFascinating! What a fortuitous mistake for historical preservation purposes. Also a good lesson in why media overwrites are important. reply mmastrac 2 hours agoprevAh yes, the two modes of disk erase failure: 1) the \"quick format\" that just re-wrote the FAT and root directory, leaving data, and 2) the immediately recognizable 0xE5 (σ in the 437 codepage). I used to use the Norton disk editor tool (IIRC, part of Disk Doctor) to explore my drive from time-to-time and it was somewhat fun to try and piece back together deleted files. In some cases, it was actually because I had accidentally deleted something important and UNDELETE wasn't good enough to get it back. In one hare-brained moment, I decided to see what would happen if I turned off the DIR attribute bits on all of the directory entries in the root of my drive to see what would happen in DOS. The stress of trying to find a boot disk to edit those attributes back left a few decades of PTSD, though I'm sure that taught me some valuable, subconscious lessons.

The issue is usually management making an arbitrary call on who is part of the development pipeline. Thus, for a time some contractors and partners may get a backup of the build tree or temporary repository access (if you catch the \"new\" users.) It is harder than one would think to keep things confidential... Cleaning up after one of these leaks is another set of problems, but usually at that point it is better to jump ship. Best of luck, =) reply greenthrow 2 hours agoprev [–] This article has a bunch of stuff asserted as facts that just aren't. As mentioned in another comment, there was nothing technically advanced about AGI itself. If other studios wanted to get into adventure games they didn't need to steal AGI to do it. And no one with a functioning brain would have used a stolen game engine for a commercial game. Companies don't want to give away their code but in the case of adventure games it's not because they are worried about their competitors. The other assertion that's off-base is that this would have been a sackable offense. No. Sierra still had legal protection against competitors using their game engine. This goof, while a little embarassing, had no real financial or security or any other damaging implications for the company. I doubt anyone would have gotten any more than a talking to about how to avoid it happening again. reply lance_ewing 2 hours agoparent [–] Yeah, that is a fair point. I was a little too eager and dramatic with my wording. I have now removed the bit about it potentially being a sackable offence, as I feel you are probably right regarding that.

Whether you're a photography enthusiast, an aspiring filmmaker, or simply a thrill-seeker looking for a new hobby, flying a drone opens up a whole new realm of excitement and exploration. In this tutorial, we'll take you through everything you need to know to take to the skies with confidence and skill. 1 minute of theory So what's the main difference between flying a drone versus driving a car? Mainly, drones move in 3D spaces whereas cars (if not jumping LOL) runs on a 2D surface. It's probably common to you of the X-Y-Z axes in 3D environments. In areospace, we call them a little differently, which is Roll/Yaw/Pitch, as illustrated below You can see that compared to cars, where you can only control the Yaw axis, airplanes give the extra Roll and Pitch axes control. The same goes with drones. Enough theories, let's play! Lesson 1: Hover Try to throttle up/down so that the drone can hover in the air using the joystick on the left by dragging the center dot up/down. This controls overall lift (thrust) generated by the drone propellers, the higher the throttle, the faster the propellers will spin. For best experience, make sure your screen is wide enough. Lesson 2: Turn (Yaw) Try to turn left/right using the joystick on the left by dragging the center dot left/right. This controls how the drone rotates around the vertical (YAW) axis. Lesson 3: Bank (Roll) Try to turn left/right using the joystick on the right by dragging the center dot left/right. This controls how the drone rotates around the longitudinal (ROLL) axis. Lesson 4: Nose up, nose down (Pitch) Try to move the nose up and down using the joystick on the right by dragging the center dot up/down. This controls how the drone rotates around the lateral (PITCH) axis. Lesson 5: Now let's fly forward For regular drones, since there's no horizontal thrust, the only way to move horizontally is by leaning towards the direction you want to go. Try to throttle up a little bit and pitch forward (nose down) to reach the mountains in front of us. Lesson 6: Coordinated turns Now let's fly around using both sticks. For best experiences, use a device with touch screens like a smart phone, tablet, or some laptops. To play in fullscreen, please add our site to your home screen by following this tutorial ‐ how to play FPVSIM Simulator on iOS/Android. It's going to take some time to calibrate yourself on how much stick deflections you need so the drone can point to the direction you want it to point to, but after a few sessions, you'll be able to fly like those guys/gals on YouTube. Congratulations, you have graduated from the \"newbie village\"! You can continue to fly in our web based simulator at FPVSIM Web which contains more features to help you learn to fly or download our desktop versions with more realistic graphics on our home page.

    "commentBody": "Drone Flying 101 – An Interactive Tutorial for Beginners (fpvsim.com)207 points by mosfets 17 hours agohidepastfavorite112 comments bambax 10 hours agoThere are two big families of drones: FPV and non-FPV (sometimes called cinematic). Flying non-FPV, GPS stabilized drones (like the DJI Mavic family of drones) requires almost no training, you just put the drone in the air and it stays there, waiting for your instructions. Flying FPV (in acro mode) has a steep learning curve (but is, arguably, much more fun). The way to learn is to use a proper simulator. The most versatile and popular one is Liftoff and costs around $20, but there are many others, including free ones. You should also buy a dedicated controller since normal game controllers don't work well (the throttle joystick needs to stay where it is instead of returning to center). Dedicated drone controllers can be found around $40-50 used. And then off you go! Be prepared to spend at least 20 hours on a sim before you can fly IRL (it took me around 100 hours to really be comfortable). It's surprising how well the learned skills transfer from the simulator to the real thing. reply MrFantastic 1 hour agoparentVelocidrone $20 is the most popular sim with the pros. It's designed to be the most accurate at as cost of graphic detail. They have open races every week. I can place in the top 300 sometimes. You can see the FPV of any of the races. The fastest pilots fly so fast it's insane. It's hard for me to comprehend how they can even comprehend what they are seeing. They will fly though a 3 gate ladder(aka corkscrew) in 1.5 seconds. reply ffsm8 50 minutes agorootparentThere is a reason why these fpvs are so successful in the Ukraine/Russian war. Much quicker than a regular soldiers reaction. And it's over. reply cjonas 4 hours agoparentprevI was able to fly the DJI avata in full manual mode with maybe only 4 hours in a sim. I'm not sure if that's because it just \"clicked\" or if the avata is just way easier than other FPV drones. I definitely think the ability to exit FPV with a click of a button and it's crazy durability have allowed me to be comfortable taking risks, which has made me a better pilot. reply th0ma5 2 hours agorootparentIt is not quite the same as FPV acro and has some additional safety features reply the__alchemist 3 hours agoparentprevGreat point. Using Liftoff and similar is a game changer. Flying in acro mode is something where you will crash repeatedly at first. (At least I did... in Liftoff thankfully!) Then after a relatively short time, the controls will be intuitive, it will feel easy, and you don't forget. Like riding a bicyle is a perfect analogy. I think 20 hours is excessive. I'd say 30 mins to 2 hours is fine, depending on the user. The most dramatic learning will happen in the first 10 mins or so. reply meheleventyone 3 hours agorootparentDepends on what you intend to do IRL if it's just fly around then a couple of hours in acro will get people up to the point where they can bimble about and sort of land but will easily get way out of their depth. reply sizzle 1 hour agoparentprevCurious, do pilots learn to fly using sims? reply Karrot_Kream 58 minutes agorootparentPrivate Pilot training tends to be in aircraft but when training for expensive, hard-to-book aircraft which require special certifications to fly there's often sim training involved. Sim training is also useful if you're about to fly an aircraft that's similar but not the same as an aircraft you're familiar with. reply NicoJuicy 10 hours agoparentprevWhat dedicated controllers would you recommend? Is there a FPV that works for both drones in real life and in games? Any ones in particular you like? reply matthew-wegner 6 hours agorootparentSome replies to this already, but quick notes: * \"Controller\" isn't used much as a term, when you start looking around. You'll see things listed under \"transmitter\" or \"radio\" * The majority of FPV transmitters use OpenTX or EdgeTX software (EdgeTX is newer and a fork of OpenTX). Both of these support plugging the transmitter in to a host computer over USB, where it can appear as a HID joystick * ExpressLRS (ELRS) is an open source radio protocol, with 2.4ghz and 900mhz versions. 2.4ghz is a denser waveforms, so better latency, but less penetration (unless you are going loooooong range, default to 2.4ghz). If you buy a radio today, get one with ELRS built in * ELRS transmitters include Bluetooth. They can act as a BLE controller to a host computer, for wireless gamepad use: https://oscarliang.com/expresslrs-bluetooth-joystick/ * And there is a 3rd option for more convenience, since both HID over USB and BLE wirelessly require a tiny bit of menu fiddling: A dedicated simulator dongle. This acts as a full ELRS receiver, so you would just turn on your radio within range and play the simulator: https://www.getfpv.com/squid-stick-wireless-usb-simulator-do... And finally, on radios themselves: * The big split is between smaller \"gamepad\" style transmitters and full-size box transmitters. The larger versions usually have more inputs than you would use, for other radio control hobbyists (wings/planes/etc) * Radiomaster is a solid recommendation. Check out the Pocket as an intro radio ($65 USD), and then the Boxer as a step up ($140 USD base, or $260 with all-metal gimbals and upgrades) * Unless you have a strong reason to, like someone is gifting you a pile of quadcopter hardware using a different protocol, go with ELRS 2.4ghz built in reply madhato 3 hours agorootparentELRS is fine but Crossfire is considered by many to be the superior radio link. The TBS Tango 2 is a great transmitter and comes with Crossfire built in. reply hylaride 2 hours agorootparentEver since ELRS 3 came out, I haven't met many people that argue that Crossfire is a superior radio link. The fact that ELRS 2.4GHz has gotten to 100KM and even now ELRS 900MHz RX's and TX's are widely available still gives that option, too. The smaller antennas for 2.4GHz are so much more convenient, as well. Also, ELRS has modes to go to higher refresh rates than crossfire in 900MHz (200Hz vs 150Hz for crossfire). ELRS is also being rapidly developed(https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/releases/) and has Gemini dual-channel modes (including cross-band support that doesn't have hardware for it yet), whereas crossfire (or TBS in general) has barely done anything. And ELRS is cheaper (as it's open source) because of multiple hardware vendors and is more widely available as TBS has always had rather poor inventory management (their site now shows as unavailable for many components). Don't get me wrong, crossfire was an absolute game changer when it came out, but TBS has really stagnated over the past few years. reply NicoJuicy 3 hours agorootparentprevThanks, that's excellent info! reply bambax 9 hours agorootparentprevI use the DJI Remote 2. It's a little expensive at $150 new / $100 used, but it's justified if you want to use it with a DJI video system in the future (Caddx Vista or DJI O3), or the Avata (but not Avata 2...) But there are controllers from BetaFPV that are much cheaper. A friend of mine just got started with the BetaFPV Radio Lite 3 ($60 new) and is very happy with it. Edit: RC2 -> Remote 2. reply 05 9 hours agorootparentYou probably meant DJI Remote 2. DJI RC2 is the one Mavics use. Anyway, I just wanted to warn anyone on the market against either DJI or BetaFPV controllers - DJI ones only work with drones that have O3 on them so if you want to fly a whoop you're going to buy another controller. And there's an issue where when your video link to the goggles breaks, your controller is offline for a couple seconds - that's all it takes to lose a drone when flying long range. Not being able to react to video loss by gaining altitude is Not a Good Thing(TM). Regarding BetaFPV: First, their gimbals are crap. Their build quality is crap as well. Oh, and it doesn't run EdgeTX, doesn't work properly with its own ELRS module when flashed to ELRS v3 and doesn't have a screen so that when you lose your drone good luck using telemetry RSSI to locate it.. Radiomaster Pocket is much better value for the same money reply bambax 9 hours agorootparentYes thanks for the correction, edited. DJI remotes work with Caddx Vista as well (the predecessor to O3); those are digital video systems that offer much better quality than analog. I have no experience with BetaFPV remotes, but I know they're cheap... reply 05 9 hours agorootparent> DJI remotes work with Caddx Vista as well Well, you're technically correct (the best kind). They work with first gen VTXes when they're upgraded to the V01.01 firmware. The catch is that if you upgrade your V1/V2 Goggles will no longer work with those VTXes.. And now there are Goggles 3 that aren't even compatible with O3 VTX yet, and it's 50/50 on whether or not they'll work with first gen - it's all a pretty big mess compatibility wise :) reply maicro 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are a lot of options out there, but from what I understand most of the common FPV controllers you'll see around will work as a HID when connected to a computer over USB. I personally have a Team BlackSheep Tango 2 - though I haven't been flying as much as I would like, and have done little simulator time, it's worked fine for both. If you want to get into the hobby in general, look up Joshua Bardwell on youtube - a lot of great information, including a variety of controller reviews, simulator reviews, and general \"here's how to get started\" videos. There are of course others, but Bardwell is the only one I'm actually subscribed to (not that I'm any great metric). EDIT: for a lot of great information, see my sibling comment from Matthew. reply wepple 9 hours agorootparentprevI’d avoid the DJI controller if you want to truly get into FPV. Eventually you’ll want to fly non-DJI quads (eg the o3 air units are too heavy for whoops, so you’ll be analog or HDZero) so stick with ELRS. The arguably best all rounder controller at a decent price point is the radiomaster boxer at about $99. Their pocket model is only $55 and super compact, but isn’t really full sized. reply coldtea 8 hours agorootparent>Eventually you’ll want to fly non-DJI quads If you do FPV for fun, maybe. If you do it for video needs you'll most likely getting a drone, usually DJI, and sticking with it. reply saidinesh5 4 hours agorootparentEven if it is just for fun, having a more powerful and a separate controller - that isn't tied to the video system is very valuable. If DJI signal gets lost, you simply punch out or trigger return to home using your ELRs controller.. and know that the quad will be safe.. reply ilikeatari 7 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, I am just getting into hobby and it looks like not many are flying dji for racing, some fly dji air unit ( just the video cam for video tx/rx but drone hardware rarely for freestyle. Even for cine dji does not dominate. What’s really cool is that a lot of people build and modify their drones as flying acro can lead to a lot of crashes:-) reply wepple 4 hours agorootparentDJI make the best easy to use quads that are basically GoPros that can be positioned anywhere in three dimension space at command. If you have a vlog about how you’re going off grid or hiking the Appalachian trail, that’s what you should use. For true FPV, the DJI quads are way too limited in many ways and are not exceptional at anything - they’re a solid high-end Toyota Corolla. The DJI video system is very good, and does make its way into a lot of custom FPV quads. But it’s very heavy and high latency (also, just as bad: variable latency), so never used for racing. And it’s also too heavy for smaller aircraft. It’s also more expensive than all alternatives, once you get past about 3 builds. reply mosfets 5 hours agorootparentprevDJI is not very good in terms of end to end latency which are necessary for racing. They are good with packed techs, but racing market is too small for them. reply coldtea 7 hours agorootparentprev>Interesting, I am just getting into hobby and it looks like not many are flying dji for racing, some fly dji air unit ( just the video cam for video tx/rx but drone hardware rarely for freestyle. Even for cine dji does not dominate. What’s really cool is that a lot of people build and modify their drones as flying acro can lead to a lot of crashes:-) Yeah, as I said for FPV and for non-video, people fly other stuff. But for non-FPV and also for video (meaning the millions doing: content creators, news, advertising, corporate, event videos, etc - don't know what Hollywood uses) typically use DJI. reply wepple 8 hours agorootparentprevDepends what type of video, doesn’t it? I’m surely biased but whenever I see people working on high-end film sets they’re using serious cinelifters, and even for property filming you typically see cinewhoops, and for action sport (motocross, drifting, etc) you’ll never see a DJI reply coldtea 7 hours agorootparentNot talking about Hollywood or high end film sets. Or something like a Nike or Superbowl ad, which has the budget of a small movie.Those can use anything, even real life helicopters. Also not familiar what they use for sports (another special case). But for millions doing content creation (professionally), news, ads, events, and such, I see DJI dominating. Again, I mean the non-FPV space (unfamiliar with that). reply bambax 6 hours agorootparentContent creators tend to use FPV more and more, because it lets them do tricks and \"spectacular\" shots not possible otherwise. But in many cases, even if the drone itself isn't DJI (and it usually isn't, for now), the video system is DJI (O3). reply wepple 5 hours agorootparentYeah, DJI clearly owns the video space for FPV, with the exception of racing and a lot of freestyle where latency is king, so HDZero or analog rules. reply 05 8 hours agorootparentprevIf H.R. 2864 [1] passes, we're all going to have to fly non-DJI quads ..

Emax tinyhawk i believe. Small enough to fly indoors reply saidinesh5 9 hours agorootparentprevThe drone controllers usually have more resolution than your typical PlayStation controllers. They can get recognised as USB joystick anyway. If you prefer game pad style controllers, you can use radiomaster pocket/Zorro depending on your budget.. ELRS version. reply mosfets 4 hours agorootparent+1 on the controllers resolution part. Just add to it, gamepads usually do things like dynamic frame rate for power saving reasons, these features are not the good if you do fly drones for competitions. Good to get a OpenTX/EdgeTX based controllers, which offers 1Khz frame rate in newer versions. reply btreecat 6 hours agorootparentprevYes. Look into radios from radiomaster with ELRS or multi protocol hardware. They have USB ports and can be plugged in and detected as a joystick. reply mosfets 4 hours agorootparentCheckout Jumper too, they are the biggest competitor of radiomaster, might offer better price with similar quality. reply fvdessen 8 hours agoprevNot entirely unrelated, but FPV drones are now the main weapon of the Ukraine war. They started using them against tanks, then groups of soldiers, but have now found that they are cost effective enough to go against individual soldiers. The drone soldiers operate in small teams from underground bunkers close to the front from which they launch hundreds of drones a day, with different types of drones for different targets. The limiting factor is the amount of drones, Ukraine plans to build one million of them this year domestically. Apart from jamming, there's not much to defend yourself against drones except staying underground, or moving fast enough that there is no time for you to be spotted and tracked. But drones can see kms away and move at hundreds of kmph, then go after you personally, even inside buildings, and even at night with infrared vision. In an interview they asked a drone-ace how many ennemies he killed, he said he couldn't remember; \"Do you remember how many cups of coffee you drank last year?\". I am not sure what to think about all this, but it is certainly fascinating reply 05 7 hours agoparentBombs and artillery is the main weapon, FPV drones are a novelty and they're being limited by being tied to the remote pilot. Pilots don't really scale that well - it takes a long time to train, and they have to be relatively close to the drone, so they're vulnerable to counter attacks. Autonomous drones are supposedly already used for oil refineries (vision based navigation, to mitigate GPS jamming), once this tech trickles down to smaller drones things will get really scary.. reply josefresco 9 minutes agorootparent> FPV drones are a novelty I can't find the link, but I believe I read Russian doctors claiming that drones were now the #1 cause of battlefield infantry injuries. reply evantbyrne 4 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn't describe the large scale use of FPV drones in conflicts over the past couple years as a \"novelty\". They perform reconnaissance on a scale that wasn't previously possible; harass, pin down, provide target coordinates for, and even directly attack infantry squads; and destroy immobilized or poorly armored vehicles. That's not even mentioning the single-use specially made drones with larger warheads, which are capable-enough of taking out armored vehicles that tank designs have been forced to evolve. reply topspin 1 hour agorootparentprev> once this tech trickles down to smaller drones That is here now. Small drones are appearing in Ukraine that target vehicles and infantry using machine vision and thermal imaging. This is driven by RF jamming that limits FPV. Also, the terminal phase of a small drone attack is often where the attack fails and automating that improves effectiveness even when FPV is possible. Less skill is necessary when a fighter can just designate a target and hit the 'kill' button, so this is a force multiplier. An interesting story on this is found here[1]. Quantity serial production is underway and it will be in wide use very soon, as in the next couple weeks. One thing they've done is secure the software to prevent reverse engineering. [1] https://mil.in.ua/en/news/drones-with-machine-vision-are-bei... Another thing that stands out to me in that article is the claim that production is limited by component availability. An obvious thing to do is further enhancing these drones by converting them from suicide drones to bomb delivery vehicles so they can be reused. > Bombs and artillery is the main weapon That's a generalization that overlooks a great deal in Ukraine. It's like selecting some organ in the body and calling it the \"main organ.\" These drones frequently provide precision forward observation that enables artillery and precision missiles. It's a system, and without FPV observation, FPV interdiction and other contributions Ukraine wouldn't be performing as well as it has. reply saidinesh5 4 hours agorootparentprev> it takes a long time to train, and they have to be relatively close to the drone, so they're vulnerable to counter attacks. You'd think so. I mean to fly a quad properly, you'd need like 20-30 hours. To just crash a drone into a large enough target, 6-7 hours is more than enough. As for having to be relatively close to the drone, range extenders these days seem to go a long way.. or even having a receiver outside a safe bunker - that seems to be how the Ukrainians/Russians fly these days. reply thadt 1 hour agorootparentprevFlying a drone from inside a bunker is, for all intents and purposes, playing a video game. Call of Duty and Flight Simulator have been training very capable pilots for years now. If you want to see the (near) future of warfare, hop on an open COD game. As for optional, full autonomy on small drones - I suspect it's further along than many might expect. reply bambax 5 hours agorootparentprev> once this tech trickles down to smaller drones We're almost there: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369380266_Channel-A... reply is_true 6 hours agorootparentprevI think the problem is with the autonomy.

Is it using Internet/4G? Isn't easy to jam those signals? reply exar0815 7 hours agoparentprevDrones basically have flipped the total modern artillery doctrine on their heads. With the proliferation of fire-finder-radar, modern artillery started to switch from dug in stationary guns to highly mobile \"shoot-and-scoot\"-tactics, in which a gun quickly fires half a dozen rounds in a time-on-target salvo and relocates to dodge the counterbattery fire. For this, modern Artillery systems like PZH2000, Archer, RCH155, Dana and Caesar are optimized. Since the advent of quick and cheap FPV drones, moving artillery on the road is much more in danger, and dug-in guns with jammers, SHORAD and overhead protection again regained the survivability edge - albeit mainly because russia lost most of its modern radar. The only western SPA with any chance of survival seems to be the PZH2000, as its on a tracked carriage allowing it offroad movement and concealment and being better armored than most wheeled contemporaries on Lorry-Chassis reply icegreentea2 6 hours agorootparentUh, I'm not sure FPVs have all of the effects that you're discussing. FPVs are significantly range limited (~10km), and have relatively small surveillance footprint. It's true that persistent ISR is significantly increasing the danger posed to all vehicles within the 10-30km (perhaps further) of the 'front line', but these are predominantly coming from different classes of drones. And yes, while FPVs can be queued onto SPGs (or whatever) by these other drones, so can other means of fires (like traditional artillery). As a reminder, tube artillery can usually reach out to at least 20km. I am not downplaying the impact that drones in general have, and I'm also not claiming that FPVs cannot significantly shape artillery operations within 5-10km of the front line. Here's the rub - Russia is clearly cable to assembly company sized AFV elements (though not consistently) to attack. And yes, we see these attacks generally get repulsed (with significant FPV drone involvement). So we know that Ukrainian ISR + FPV combination (Ukraine has been limiting its artillery usage) can be overwhelmed in the deeper space - it is possible to mass company sized elements, and transit them through into the line of contact, reasonably intact. There's no denying that PzH2000 is more survivable than Archer or Caesar (that is infact the entire point of Archer and Caesar - trade suitability and tactical mobility for strategic/operational mobility). But you're also missing like... M109? Like by numbers, there were more M109s donated than any other western platform. reply praptak 4 hours agorootparentDomakha has ~50km range. Here's a report (in Polish) from a FO mission to correct HIMARS fire (sadly the drone was lost but the Russians had to send a fighter jet to shoot it down with a rocket): https://x.com/Aldohartwinska/status/1792838189494706220 reply fullspectrumdev 4 hours agorootparentprevFPV drones have been used at much longer ranges than that - it’s pretty well documented with videos that with repeater systems there’s now been strikes in excess of 25km using FPV, by both sides. That’s not to downplay artillery though: you simply cannot deliver the volume of fires with drones that you can with tubes. reply exar0815 5 hours agorootparentprev>>And yes, while FPVs can be queued onto SPGs (or whatever) by these other drones, so can other means of fires (like traditional artillery). As a reminder, tube artillery can usually reach out to at least 20km. Yeah but that's the whole point thats been discussed in interested circles - the shift of the vulnerability of SPGs from the firing to the travel phase in absence of accompanying VSHORAD. (If they just had 2000 Gepards) And as Gunlorrys have to travel and fire on certain roads, that decreases the problem space. For the M109, you are completely right. I missed that one. I am not saying that tube artillery has a problem, but that ~10-20km around the line of contact seems to be the place you don't want to rely on mobility alone for survivability. Rheinmetall currently seems to be developing a 100km ranged base bleed grenade for 155mm pipes. reply icegreentea2 4 hours agorootparentOk that makes sense. I agree that persistent ISR has dramatically increased the vulnerability of especially road bound SPGs behind the line of contact. I guess in my first post, I was emphasizing that the catalyst for this increased vulnerability was not the FPV drones, but rather of ISR drones. reply hylaride 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm not going to go into details of why I know (other than I'm an FPV pilot with a drone licence in my country and I have direct connections to pilots operating in a certain conflict), but you're more wrong than right. FPV drones have become a factor and like all new technologies, had an immediate impact that has since been blunted by adapting, eg EM warfare/jamming, \"cope cages\" around tanks, and the fact that it's still artillery killing the most soldiers. FPV drones carrying anything more than antipersonnel grenades are heavy, with limited range and can have EW sensors track the control link signal sources that can then be responded with artillery. Since a lot of the adaptions have happened, FPV pilots on both sides have become more about harassing the enemy than a strategic flipping of artillery doctrine (which was shifting to more mobile batteries before FPV drones came into the picture). reply KptMarchewa 5 hours agorootparentprevLancets are much bigger problem for artillery as they are not as limited in range as FPVs. reply rainworld 5 hours agorootparentprevPrimary reason the 2000 fares better in terms of survival is because they are being extra careful with them. Likely the condition under which they were provided. But that means fewer missions, greater distance and so on. reply coldtea 8 hours agoparentprev>In an interview they asked a drone-ace how many ennemies he killed, he said he couldn't remember; \"Do you remember how many cups of coffee you drank last year?\".

It’s fantastic how tax payer pay for real outdated, but properly certified crap. Long story short: Bundeswehr soldier can’t use improvised drone at all. In fact he also needs a license and insurance.

Sure the criminals can level your city but they need toe eventually move their troops in to pillage the resources and then you can make them pay. Only downside is with countries that can afford to lose 1000+ men a day for years, it will cost them and you a lot. Anyone knows if in China such men loses are acceptable for the population. reply avidiax 14 hours agoprevIt's quite annoying that every stage of the lesson requires you to recalibrate your controller. When I learned to fly racing drones, I used Velocidrone; I have no experience of FPVSim. Even if you don't plan to eventually fly an acrobatic or racing drone, the sim experience can be a bit relaxing & focused. I used to practice on a 2nd monitor while I was in large mandatory group meetings for work. If you do plan to build and fly drones, then a simulator is absolutely worth every penny. You pay for real drone crashes with time and money, and you probably need 100 hours of practice before you can handle the real thing (and not that well). If I were going to get back into the hobby, I'd probably try to do long range fixed wing aircraft with FPV and flight automation. The view will be much more enjoyable and the batteries will last much longer. I think there's also less community pressure around RC planes vs. drones, especially the loud racing ones. reply 05 11 hours agoparent> If I were going to get back into the hobby, I'd probably try to do long range fixed wing aircraft with FPV and flight automation. For me personally that’s too boring.. Long range is illegal in lots of places; in the US you technically need a spotter and the craft needs to be in direct line of sight, and pretty close because it should be visible with unaided eye - so, no binoculars. 3.5\" is the sweet spot where you can build a sub 250g (or almost sub 250 - do cops really carry kitchen scales on them?) drone with decent performance that doesn't scare people when you fly around and still has the performance close to a 5\" one and you can still do all of the tricks. The only drawback with 3.5\" is that they're more susceptible to wind, so if it's always very windy where you fly, maybe consider a 5\". Oh, and you also don't need to install a remote ID module on a sub 250g quad. reply btreecat 6 hours agorootparentStill need a spotter. And if you have 107 for YouTube money, then sub 250g doesn't give you any alleviation from RID. reply chasd00 3 hours agoparentprevI was in to drone racing for a while then got out of it and in to high powered rocketry. Interestingly, a friend is moving and wants me to take over his passion project. A rocket powered glider using an 'M' (pretty powerful) rocket motor. He has a smaller POC working with an ardupilot autopilot launching on 'H' motors. The basic gist is the rocket takes the glider up and the autopilot handles the flying until the altitude is low and then manual takeover for landing. On an M motor, the glider is going to go far out of site so the ardupilot will have to get it back to the flight line where i can see it and land. I need to check the rules closely because there's exceptions for rocket powered gliders but I don't think i'll be able to launch at a sanctioned event and will probably have to go out to FAR (friends of amatuer rocketry) which is a multi-day drive for me. Tripoli, the main governing body for experimental high powered rocketry, has rules about guided recovery with some exceptions for gliders. I have a feeling a rocket powered glider would have to remain in sight at all times which wouldn't be the case with an 'M' motor sending it up. Someone building a rocket that can fly to 100k feet and then land at a waypoint would attract a lot of unwanted attention from authorities and be bad for the hobby which is why those rules exist. reply mosfets 5 hours agoparentprevSorry, this tutorial is meant to be played with the on-screen virtual joystick. Not many people have radios lying around after all. reply saidinesh5 14 hours agoparentprevI think these days things have changed for the better... Free simulators,light weight fun builds that don't easily be damaged/cause damage from crashes.. I just bought my first fixed wing, but it made me realize why i like my sub 100 gram \" 3\" toothpick\" kind of quads even more. i can fly those around the home, i get 10+ minutes of flight time (trust me, it gets annoying after 8-9 minutes and you need a break before you fly the next battery!), and even if i crash that 1S toothpick into something or someone, you barely cause a scratch.. reply btreecat 6 hours agoparentprevWings are just so much fun because of the longer flight times and no need for a flight controller. FC are essential for long range missions typically, but I have pushed several miles on just GPS overlay in my video feed. reply senectus1 12 hours agoparentprevI really wanna give this a go. what controller would you recommend? reply muu-g 29 minutes agorootparentCheck out https://www.fpvknowitall.com/fpv-shopping-list-controller-an... , it describes some of the best different options are depending on budget or requirements. reply 05 11 hours agorootparentprevRadiomaster Boxer is probably the goto one for FPV quadcopters. If you want to fly LoS and autonomous missions then Radiomaster TX16S (large touchscreen, community support, all the LUA tememetry widgets you could ever want). For the link, it's either ELRS for manual flying or mLRS for Mavlink telemetry over LoRa. reply wepple 9 hours agorootparent+1 on the boxer. Great for everything at a pretty damn good price point. reply senectus1 10 hours agorootparentprevThank you very much! reply mosfets 12 hours agorootparentprevI would recommend one of the radios that run OpenTX or EdgeTX (fork of OpenTX firmware: https://www.open-tx.org. These radios support a wide variaty of RF modules and have good support for simulators. No need to get a too expensive one. reply senectus1 10 hours agorootparentgood to know, thanks! reply saidinesh5 10 hours agorootparentprevDepending on your personal preference, go with radiomaster pocket/zorro/boxer - ELRS version. reply qup 12 hours agoparentprevVelocidrone is a lot of fun. There's also freerider fpv, DRL, and Liftoff. They're all pretty good, honestly. reply smallerfish 2 hours agoprevDoes anybody fly Ardupilot? Last time I was really into flying I used DRonin, which sadly got abandoned. I have a real aversion to BetaFlight, though I know it's got 90% of the market; however, Ardupilot seems to have a reasonably active community. I don't really care about freestyling - I'm more interested in cruising over forest canopy, and having a reliable return to home function if radio signal gets lost. (I have probably 15 built out airframes; over time I probably need to replace defunct hardware, but a lot of it still seems reasonably acceptable. Quite a few f7 controllers for example.) reply thadt 2 hours agoparentArdupilot is quite good, but I would say it's kinda similar to Linux in terms of an operating system for your drone. It can be configured to work with a wide array of hardware and operations, but its 'off the shelf' interface isn't going to be as polished as some other more hardware specific systems. If you want to build your own, and have full control over your system, Ardupilot is a great place to start. reply kqr 11 hours agoprevHuh, once I figured out how to switch to first person view and acro mode and hooked up my PlayStation controller this was surprisingly fun – it behaved a little like a more friendly helicopter simulator. The most annoying part was that I couldn't have throttle on a completely separate control from the rotation axes, and the frequent brief freezes I got in Firefox. If this is an indication of what it is like to fly real FPV drones, I'll have to put a lock on my wallet. reply 05 10 hours agoparent> The most annoying part was that I couldn't have throttle on a completely separate control from the rotation axes You wouldn't want that because throttle is essential for flight control unlike with fixed wing where it's somewhat set and forget in many situations. It's partially alleviated by 'real' radios not having a spring on the throttle axis, so it stays in the position you've put it and part of it is just more practice.. reply kqr 6 hours agorootparentI was actually thinking more in terms of helicopters having the collective on a separate input from yaw... bur then again, helicopter pilots use their feet to yaw, not their fingers. Not springing back the throttle to neutral makes a lot of sense and would probably help! reply mosfets 4 hours agoparentprevNice! Glad you liked it. Try a webkit based browser instead like Chrome/Safari/Edge, I'm not sure how much WebGL optimization firefox carries. reply btreecat 6 hours agoprevIs there a native Linux client yet?

Potensic is trying to exist, and their drones aren't bad, but not as good as those from DJI and costing about the same. Hubsan was once promising but seems to have entirely dropped the ball. Anafi's long dead. One sometimes hear about Skydio but they seem to only exist in the US? I don't know anyone who flies them. For FPV drones there are many more options. I think one of the best brands is GepRC but there are so many others, it's impossible to mention them all. Still, for the video transmitting system, DJI is still dominant there as well, but at least you can use alternatives if you really don't like them (Walksnail for digital, or lots of others for analog). reply 05 9 hours agorootparentSkydio has abandoned its consumer business - DJI basically killed them and now they're busy lobbying to ban DJI from government use (or ideally just ban them from being used in the US altogether - yay protectionism). iFlight is probably among the top BnF brands together with GepRC, but nowadays it's cheaper to build your own (used to be BnF/PnP ones were cheaper than parts, no longer the case). reply wepple 9 hours agoparentprevOnce you step outside of DJI there’s so much variety, what do you want to do? If you’re learning to fly FPV, get a betafpv all inclusive kit like the cetus series - that’s what I started on. Eventually though, if you’re flying hard you’ll crash hard so you want to know how to build and therefore fix your quads. I highly highly recommend Joshua Bardwells DIY build kit and YT video series. But you can also buy bind-n-fly quads like the Nazgul. reply ilikeatari 7 hours agoparentprevJoshua Bardwell has tons of educational videos on YouTube discussing options. Also his website has articles that are up to date on solid hardware options. It depends a bit if you wanna fly racing, freestyle or cine. I really do recommend his content especially learn to fly in sim with ELRS boxer radio. reply saidinesh5 10 hours agoparentprevWhat's the purpose though? If it's dji like flying, there's skydio . If it's fpv racing, freestyle etc ... There are many ready to fly options. Starting at 50 grams all up weight for indoor flying to 5\" 200+kmph racers to bigger 7\" long range quads.. reply palata 9 hours agoparentprevIf you want to go the DIY way, it can be a fun experience to build your drone (from a kit).

You can do it if you are far from populated areas but you need to go trough a complicated bureaucracy and obtain a permit before each flight. reply blutack 11 hours agoparentThis is not true as a blanket statement unless you are talking about commercial flying, large drones or restricted airspace. I'm not sure what country you are referring to but I haven't personally come across one that requires a per flight permit outside of higher risk commercial operations. Most EU countries are pretty harmonised on drone rules at this point. Sub 250g drones such as the DJI Mini series and the Autel Nano will give you the most flexibility in places you can fly legally. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparent> I haven't personally come across one that requires a per flight permit outside of higher risk commercial operations Portugal requires approval from the coast guard if your planned flight is within certain distance from a beach/the sea, which is quite easy in a coastal and islands country. reply blutack 9 hours agorootparentI don't read Portuguese but there's nothing specifically regarding beaches in their courtesy translation [1] beyond avoiding areas next to SAR helicopter bases (which is fair enough) and there's nothing on their UAS restrictions map [2] that would be unusual in any other EU country. I have flown (below 120m obviously) in Portugal near the beach with a but you need to be able to see the drone To have line-of-sight.

    "originBody": "Emacs Easy Draw Emacs Easy Draw is a drawing tool that runs inside Emacs. Requirements Emacs 27.2 Image support SVG support gzip and gunzip(or zlib support) libxml support Screenshots https://github.com/misohena/el-easydraw/wiki/Screenshots Use In Org-Mode - edraw-org.el Config (with-eval-after-load 'org (require 'edraw-org) (edraw-org-setup-default)) ;; When using the org-export-in-background option (when using the ;; asynchronous export function), the following settings are ;; required. This is because Emacs started in a separate process does ;; not load org.el but only ox.el.

Draw something and type C-c C-c and the data will be saved in the buffer. Link Notation [[edraw:file=./example.edraw.svg]] [[edraw:data=]] [[*Example][edraw:file=./example.edraw.svg]] [[*Example][edraw:data=]] Inline Images To toggle the inline display mode, type M-x edraw-org-link-image-mode Edit Image To edit the image, do one of the following on the link: M-x edraw-org-edit-link C-c C-o Right click on image (The right-click menu also provides some other useful functions for links) Export As HTML Customization Variables: edraw-org-export-html-data-tag HTML tag used to export data links. (svg or img) edraw-org-export-html-file-tag HTML tag used to export file links. (svg or img) edraw-org-export-html-use-viewbox Add viewBox= attribute to svg root elements when SVG export. Link Properties: html-tag HTML tag used to export the link. (svg or img) Example: [[edraw:html-tag=img;data=]] As LaTeX I have a minimal implementation, but I don’t use LaTeX usually, so there may be some problems. [[edraw:data=]] format creates a temporary file when exporting as LaTeX. Please let me know if there is a better way in LaTeX. Regular File Link Support You can also edit regular file links inline. For example, create a link like this: [[file:example.edraw.svg]] Then do M-x edraw-org-edit-regular-file-link on this link and the drawing editor will appear in its place. Inline display after editing is possible with org-toggle-inline-images. You can also use org-flyimage if you want to display images automatically. The normal file link has the following drawbacks compared to the edraw link format. No detailed settings for HTML export. SVG data cannot be embedded inside org files. Data URI links are technically possible, but inline editing of Data URI links is not implemented. On the other hand, regular file links have the advantage that they can be exported in many formats. Edit a Single Edraw File - edraw-mode.el The data that Emacs Easy Draw handles is a small subset of the SVG specification. The recommended file extension is .edraw.svg. Emacs Easy Draw cannot edit general SVG data, but the data it outputs can be viewed by web browsers and other software that can handle SVG. Open .edraw.svg files using edraw-mode To open a file with the extension .edraw.svg using edraw-mode, add the following setting to init.el. (autoload 'edraw-mode \"edraw-mode\") (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.edraw\\\\.svg$\" . edraw-mode)) NOTE: Setup later than other modes for .svg such as image-mode.

Unfortunately I don't want to get on the bandwagon. You know, when a guy is singing to me about toilet paper - you may need the money but, I mean, rob a 7-11! Do something with dignity and save us all the trouble of peeing on your grave. I don't want to rail at length here, but it's like a fistula for me. If you subscribe to your personal mythology, to the point where you do your own work, and then somebody puts decals over it, it no longer carries the same weight.

All of you guys! You're sissies! \" WAITS V. FRITO-LAY, INC., 978 F.2D 1093 In September and October 1988, some 250 American radio-stations aired a commercial to introduce a new Frito-Lay product (SalsaRio Doritos corn chips) featuring a song very similar to Waits's \"Step Right Up\" (performed by Waits impersonator Stephen Carter). Waits himself apparently first heard the commercial when he was at the Los Angeles radio station KCRW to do an interview (KCRW-FM: Morning Becomes Eclectic. October 3, 1988). Since the mid- 1970's Waits had spoken out against doing commercials. As a matter of fact, the song \"Step Right Up\" itself was condemning business talk in the music industry and in general. One can imagine Waits was not amused when he heard Carter sing: \"It's buffo, boffo, bravo, gung ho, tallyho, but never mellow / Try 'em, buy 'em, get 'em, got 'em!\" Waits was outraged. He realized \"immediately that whoever was going to hear this and obviously identify the voice would also identify that Tom Waits in fact had agreed to do a commercial for Doritos.\"(5) Frito-Lay Inc. company logo. Copyright Frito-Lay In November 1988 Waits sued Frito-Lay Inc. and its advertising agency Tracy-Locke Inc., alleging claims of: - False endorsement (under the Lanham (Federal trademark) Act. This act prohibits the use of false designations of origin, false descriptions, and false representations in the advertising and sale of goods and services) - Misappropriation of his voice (under California law) A false endorsement claim based on the unauthorized use of a celebrity's identity is a type of false association claim, for it alleges the misuse of a trademark, i.e., a symbol or device such as a visual likeness, vocal imitation, or other uniquely distinguishing characteristic, which is likely to confuse consumers as to the plaintiff's sponsorship or approval of the product.(5) Waits testified that when he heard the Doritos commercial, \"this corn chip sermon,\" he was shocked and very angry. These feelings \"grew and grew over a period of a couple of days\" because of his strong public opposition to doing commercials. Waits testified, \"It embarrassed me. I had to call all my friends, that if they hear this thing, please be informed this is not me. I was on the phone for days. I also had people calling me saying, Gee, Tom, I heard the new Doritos ad.\" Added to this evidence of Waits' shock, anger, and embarrassment is the strong inference that, because of his outspoken public stance against doing commercial endorsements, the Doritos commercial humiliated Waits by making him an apparent hypocrite.(5) The jury could have inferred from the evidence that the commercial created a public impression that Waits was a hypocrite for endorsing Doritos. Moreover, it also could have inferred damage to his artistic reputation, for Waits had testified that \"part of my character and personality and image that I have cultivated is that I do not endorse products.\"(5) Tom Waits did not sue Frito-Lay for copyright infringement. At the time Waits didn't own the copyright (in the work of authorship) to the song \"Step Right Up\". This was, and is, owned by Fifth Floor Music Inc (controlled by Martin/ Herb, Evan Cohen). One might assume Frito-Lay did indeed obtain the \"synch\" license from Fifth Floor Music to use the song in the commercial. And as they were not using the song as recorded by Waits himself, they didn't have to worry about copyright in the musical work (owned by Elektra/ Asylum). Had Waits at that time owned the copyrights to the song, he would surely have sued for copyright infringement. Publicity rights allow a person to control the use of his name or likeness in association with the sale of a commercial product. Waits sued for \"false endorsement\" (the public was led to believe that Waits was singing, and this deception violated Waits' publicity rights by associating him with a commercial product he did not want to endorse) and \"misappropriation of his voice\" (suggesting there was as a matter of fact something recognizable and distinctive as: \"his voice\"). Had Frito-Lay used the music only or used a voice that sounded nothing like Waits', Waits would probably not have had a case. But Frito-Lay somehow wanted the \"real thing.\" Jay S. Jacobs (2000): \"Waits's song \"Step Right Up,\" on Small Change is a parody of hucksterism, couched in the same angry language Waits used when he spoke to interviewers about art peddling. The mystery product that the song's persona is hustling does everything and nothing. It'll shine your car. Get rid of embarrassing stains. Lie to your wife. Pay off your credit cards. Walk the dog and pick up the kids at school. Make you six foot five, blond, and beautiful. Do your taxes. Return your tapes to the video store. And then, when you're done with it, it'll turn into a six-pack of beer and a pizza. Who in the world could take \"Step Right Up\" seriously as a sales pitch? Well, Frito-Lay did. The snack-food giant actually hit on the notion that \"Step Right Up\" would make the perfect jingle to introduce their newest corn-chip flavor, Salsa Rio Doritos. A hot and spicy song for a hot and spicy chip. They couldn't use their old corporate spokescartoon, the Frito Bandito; he'd been forced to retire during the seventies when a Mexican group protested that he was nothing but a racist stereotype. So, since they couldn't have their Bandito, the Frito-Lay people wanted the next best thing: Tom Waits.\" (1) Waits's predecessor Frito Bandito: \"The bandito character was created by animation legend Tex Avery for a commercial ad campaign in the late 1960's\" The 9th Circuit Court decision documents some entertaining background information on how Frito-Lay came to this particular commercial: \"The story of Tracy-Locke's search for a lead singer for the commercial suggests that no one would do but a singer who could not only capture the feeling of \"Step Right Up\" but also imitate Tom Waits' voice. The initial efforts of the ad agency's creative team, using a respected professional singer with a deep bluesy voice, met with disapproval from executives at both Tracy- Locke and Frito-Lay. Tracy-Locke then auditioned a number of other singers who could sing in a gravelly style. Stephen Carter was among those who auditioned. A recording engineer who was acquainted with Carter's work had recommended him to Tracy-Locke as someone who did a good Tom Waits imitation. Carter was a professional musician from Dallas and a Tom Waits fan. Over ten years of performing Waits songs as part of his band's repertoire, he had consciously perfected an imitation of Waits' voice. When Carter auditioned, members of the Tracy-Locke creative team \"did a double take\" over Carter's near-perfect imitation of Waits, and remarked to him how much he sounded like Waits. In fact, the commercial's musical director warned Carter that he probably wouldn't get the job because he sounded too much like Waits, which could pose legal problems. Carter, however, did get the job. At the recording session for the commercial David Brenner, Tracy-Locke's executive producer, became concerned about the legal implications of Carter's skill in imitating Waits, and attempted to get Carter to \"back off\" his Waits imitation. Neither the client nor the members of the creative team, however, liked the result. After the session, Carter remarked to Brenner that Waits would be unhappy with the commercial because of his publicly avowed policy against doing commercial endorsements and his disapproval of artists who did. Brenner acknowledged he was aware of this, telling Carter that he had previously approached Waits to do a Diet Coke commercial and \"you never heard anybody say no so fast in your life.\" Brenner conveyed to Robert Grossman, Tracy-Locke's managing vice president and the executive on the Frito-Lay account, his concerns that the commercial was too close to Waits' voice. As a precaution, Brenner made an alternate version of the commercial with another singer. On the day the commercial was due for release to radio stations across the country, Grossman had a ten-minute long-distance telephone consultation with Tracy-Locke's attorney, asking him whether there would be legal problems with a commercial that sought to capture the same feeling as Waits' music. The attorney noted that there was a \"high profile\" risk of a lawsuit in view of recent case law recognizing the protectability of a distinctive voice. Based on what Grossman had told him, however, the attorney did not think such a suit would have merit, because a singer's style of music is not protected. Grossman then presented both the Carter tape and the alternate version to Frito-Lay, noting the legal risks involved in the Carter version. He recommended the Carter version, however, and noted that Tracy-Locke would indemnify Frito-Lay in the event of a lawsuit. Frito-Lay chose the Carter version.\"(5) The case was tried before a jury in April and May 1990. Waits did not include Stephen Carter in the suit because Carter had only been paid scale for his participation. In fact, Carter became one of Waits's strongest witnesses. He felt badly about his part in the fiasco and wanted to redeem himself.(1) Tom Waits (1992): \"They imitated my voice. The guy who did the voice was like a fan of mine who does an impersonation of me and lives in Texas; plays in a band... He felt so bad that he did this. He knew when he did it he was doing a bad thing. But he vindicated himself by helping us win the case.\"(3) Tom Waits (1999): \"This guy from Texas got paid 300 bucks to do me. That was his specialty, anyway, that he does this perfect impersonation of me. And they did this whole thing around \"Step Right Up,\" and every now and then they would say \"Fritos\" or whatever. And afterward, the guy felt so bad, he came out as our star witness.\"(2) After (a four week) trial before Judge James Ideman in the United States District Court (Central District of California)(4), the jury returned a $2.6 million verdict in Waits' favor comprised of: - $375,000 in actual compensatory damages, for infringement of the right of publicity/ false endorsement (including $100,000 for the fair market value of Waits' services under the Lanham Act claim. $200,000 for injury to his peace, happiness, and feelings. $75,000 for injury to his goodwill, professional standing, and future publicity value); - $2,000,000 in punitive damages for voice misappropriation ($1.5 million against Tracy-Locke and $500,000 against Frito- Lay); - $100,000 damages for violation of the Lanham Act - $125,000 Attorney fees Tom Waits (1992): \"I haven't seen a dime. These things go on forever and forever. Never get involved in litigation. Your hair will fall out, your bones will turn to sand. And it will still be going on. \"It was like throwing a rock through a window-but you wait for five years to hear the sound. Litigation is like picking up a glass of water with a prosthetic hand. It's very frustrating, and you'll never get it to your lips. But when you have to, you have to. If somebody burned your house down, you'd have to do something about it.\"(3) Defendants Frito-Lay Inc. and Tracy-Locke Inc. appealed on December 3, 1991. In challenging the judgment on Waits' false endorsement claim(5) - that Waits lacks standing to sue for false endorsement. Asserting that because he is not in competition with the defendants, he cannot sue under the Lanham Act. - that Waits did not establish his claim at trial, and that damages and attorney's fees were improperly awarded. Because it is duplicative In challenging the judgment on Waits' voice misappropriation claim(5) - that the decision, recognizing voice misappropriation as a California tort, is no longer good law. - that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of voice misappropriation. Discussing the right of publicity, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict that the defendants had committed the \"Midler tort\" by misappropriating Tom Waits' voice for commercial purposes. The Midler tort is a species of violation of the right of publicity that protects against the unauthorized imitation of a celibrity's voice which is distinctive and widely known, for commercial purposes.(6) On August 5, 1992 the 9th Circuit Court vacated the award of damages under the Lanham Act as duplicative of the damages awarded for infringement of the right of publicity, but affirmed all other aspects of the verdict and judgment. Waits had won... Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F.2d 1093 (9th Cir. 1992): \"Waits' voice misappropriation claim and his Lanham Act claim are legally sufficient. The court did not err in instructing the jury on elements of voice misappropriation. The jury's verdict on each claim is supported by substantial evidence, as are its damage awards. Its award of damages on Waits' Lanham Act claim, however, is duplicative of damages awarded for voice misappropriation; accordingly we vacate it. Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees under the Lanham Act. Waits is awarded his costs on appeal.\"(5) Tom Waits (2002): \"... Yeah, we nailed 'em. It was David and Goliath... They were lame. The problem with a big company like that is that its hands don't talk to its feet, and nobody knows what anyone else is doing. In this case, it was an ad agency that hired a fan of mine actually, in Texas. And they paid him like 60 bucks to come in and do an impersonation of me. Then, a little later, I was doing a radio interview, and the guy says we have to break for a commercial, so he punches that ad in... I said that guy sounds just like me. I mean, there's a lot of things I can't remember, but I think I would have remembered doing that. I had an excellent attorney that went to bat for us.\"(7) Tom Waits (1999): \"Two and a half million bucks. Spent it all on candy. My mom told me I was foolish. I've always been foolish when it comes to money....\"(8) Perception of Doors(9) (The Nation: September 19, 2002) Woodland Hills, Calif. Thank you for your eloquent \"rant\" by John Densmore of The Doors on the subject of artists allowing their songs to be used in commercials [\"Riders on the Storm,\" July 8]. I spoke out whenever possible on the topic even before the Frito Lay case (Waits v. Frito Lay), where they used a sound-alike version of my song \"Step Right Up\" so convincingly that I thought it was me. Ultimately, after much trial and tribulation, we prevailed and the court determined that my voice is my property. Songs carry emotional information and some transport us back to a poignant time, place or event in our lives. It's no wonder a corporation would want to hitch a ride on the spell these songs cast and encourage you to buy soft drinks, underwear or automobiles while you're in the trance. Artists who take money for ads poison and pervert their songs. It reduces them to the level of a jingle, a word that describes the sound of change in your pocket, which is what your songs become. Remember, when you sell your songs for commercials, you are selling your audience as well. When I was a kid, if I saw an artist I admired doing a commercial, I'd think, \"Too bad, he must really need the money.\" But now it's so pervasive. It's a virus. Artists are lining up to do ads. The money and exposure are too tantalizing for most artists to decline. Corporations are hoping to hijack a culture's memories for their product. They want an artist's audience, credibility, good will and all the energy the songs have gathered as well as given over the years. They suck the life and meaning from the songs and impregnate them with promises of a better life with their product. Eventually, artists will be going onstage like race-car drivers covered in hundreds of logos. John, stay pure. Your credibility, your integrity and your honor are things no company should be able to buy. TOM WAITS Notes: (1) Source: \"Wild Years - The Music And Myth Of Tom Waits\" Jay S. Jacobs.

Case in point, Owen Wilson was the voice of the main character in the Cars movie, but they got a different voice actor for some of the cartoons who sounded similar. Same thing for the ghostbuster cartoon after the movie was a big success in the 80s. Why is that ok? reply fathyb 0 minutes agoparentIsn't because in Cars the character itself is the IP, not the actor? For example, if Owen Wilson started cosplaying as the Cars character and making money out of it, he could be sued.

A deliberate replication of an artist's distinct singing voice, while singing lyrics associated with that artist, is very different than a passing similarity to someone's non-unique speaking voice. Note that the Johansson issue is playing out only in the court of public opinion. reply sdenton4 1 hour agorootparentIf you think they weren't trying to replicate sj's voice, I can only assume you've got open ai stock clouding your judgement...

The AI and the now-famous actor are the end products of a selection process aimed at a similar audience. The AI creators were likely aiming for the most attractive female voice, according to a bunch of young men. That parallels the process used by those casting action movies, which are also aimed at young men. It should be to nobody's great surprise that the end products of both share many features. What is very odd is how similar celeb faces actually are. There really is a mathematical standard for beauty when it comes to female faces, which is why so many celebs are have eerily identical proportions. There is probably a model too for voices. https://gotobeauty.com/plastic-surgery/how-math-shapes-moder... reply KennyBlanken 1 hour agorootparentprevNon-unique? What? \"Passing similarity\"? All her friends and coworkers say it sounds like her - she describes being contacted by friends who thought she'd done it. A lot of the public, including HNers, identified the voice as hers, independently - not in some A/B test, but they heard it and said to themselves \"Johanasson did the voice for this.\" You're the only person in the room who thinks OpenAI didn't use samples of her voice for their voice model - or that the voice has \"passing similarity.\" Altman approached her asking her to do it. She refused; they went ahead and did it anyway, probably using interviews since the audio would be very clean - and two days before they went live with it, Altman tried to negotiate a second time and was rebuffed. Released it anyway. Why would Altman feel the need to panic-negotiate a second time, days before they went live, if they hadn't used her voice for it? If OpenAI designed it to sound like her, that's Midler tort. They actually used her voice to train it, which means Midler tort and more. The question will be how much more - I hope they get sued into the ground. reply Matticus_Rex 10 minutes agorootparent> You're the only person in the room who thinks OpenAI didn't use samples of her voice for their voice model Really? No one seems to be claiming that anywhere I've seen. We know that they really did use a voice actress, and that it really is her actual voice, and that she was hired for it before ScarJo was approached. There's no \"panic negotiation\" there -- the most panic needed would be if someone internally identified that there could be a PR issue if people mistakenly thought it was close enough to seem like intentional impersonation. Of course they wanted ScarJo, once they thought of it! It'd be great publicity. But that doesn't then mean that anyone who sounds somewhat like ScarJo (but certainly not identical) becomes retroactively unusable or makes it vocal impersonation. reply codelikeawolf 3 hours agoprevTom Waits did some advertising work when he narrated a dog food commercial [1], but I think his artistic integrity is still intact considering all he did was a voiceover (no singing). In true Tom Waits fashion, when he was asked about why he did it, his response was \"I was down on my luck and I like dogs\". One of the things I love about Tom Waits is that his interviews are just as entertaining as his songs. [1] https://youtu.be/8h6TYV3Tz00?si=hT51w3JvdGsJTPmW reply karaterobot 1 hour agoparent> The advertisers are banking on your credibility, but the problem is it's no longer yours. I think nowadays, the idea that doing a commercial damages your artistic integrity is considered sort of an anachronism. For better and worse, I guess, and largely driven by the consequences of technology in any case. But, a similar lawsuit today would probably be about damaging the monetary value of the artist's brand, rather than about damaging their artistic credibility per se, as it was with Waits at the time. It used to be a truism that taking money from sponsors changed your allegiances, and changed the nature of your art. For the worse. Whether time has been proven that true or false is an exercise for the reader. Point is, that's where Waits seems to be coming from. It's not about \"they didn't pay me first,\" it's about the commercial diminishing his credibility because it looks like he might have agreed to do it in the first place. reply ska 1 hour agorootparent> is considered sort of an anachronism. I'm not sure this is true. It was always the case that these things were contextual and based a lot on how the artist/musician/author presented themselves. The whole idea of \"selling out\" is predicated on the assumption you have some high ground to give up, or at least that the action you are taking would undermine strongly held beliefs of your fan base. When popularity swings more to (obviously) commercially driven output, there is plenty of selling, but less selling \"out\", as it were. The pendulum will likely swing again. reply karaterobot 26 minutes agorootparentAre you saying the actual anachronism is that artists are even associated with credibility, integrity, or authenticity to sell out in the first place? If so, I guess that's a more precise way of saying why selling out isn't a thing anymore. Personally, I think it's more a change in how artists view themselves in relation to the market—and how audiences view them as well—and that artists can still stay true to that understanding and have it be a kind of ethos... just a very different one than we had when I formed my opinions on music. What I'm saying is, artists can still perform acts of betrayal, and lose their credibility to their audience. So, they must have some to lose it. It's more that licensing their music is not one of those acts anymore. reply chefandy 3 hours agoparentprevYeah.

I'm not a voice expert and I dont know all the technical terms but it isn't very similar in tone, cadence, or what I want to call texture (?)

She owns the rights to her voice, not any vaguely similar sounding white female voice put together before they even talked to her. reply Retric 2 hours agorootparentOpenAI didn’t need to talk to her to create an imitation there’s many recordings freely available. Recording beforehand therefore has zero impact on their ability or intent to imitate such a public figure. The core question eventually put before a jury would be if it was unintentionally similar or an imitation and attempting to pay her for use of her voice is clear evidence they wanted it because of it or they perceived the voices where overly similar. Either of those are possible, but to then use the voice anyway became problematic. reply ComplexSystems 38 minutes agorootparentIt doesn't matter if they \"could\" have made a copy of her voice if they didn't actually do it, and the voice actress who recorded Sky's voice is saying just that. reply Retric 5 minutes agorootparentRead up on Glover vs Universal, the likeness doesn’t have to be that close to run into issues and that’s for the studio who owned the character. I’m not saying Sky did anything wrong.

Is that entire category supposed to be off the table after SJ declined? reply Retric 2 hours agorootparentThere’s literally thousands of flirty female voices which would have sounded like a different actress, singer, etc who they didn’t approach and therefore would have been less risky. Really using a voice on a digital assistant that sounds like the actress playing a role of a digital assistant is just dumb.

There isn’t one ChatGPT voice that would have either gone to this actress or Johansson. People are making the assumption that if Johansson agreed, Johansson’s voice would have replaced the Sky voice option, but there’s no evidence that this would have happened. It’s likely that Johansson’s would have been just another voice option, in addition to Sky and all the other options available. reply Retric 2 hours agorootparentIf they had 1,000 voices I would definitely be onboard with that interpretation, especially if they then went on trying to contact dozens of famous people for their voices.

My initial post said: “used Sky from the beginning” If they had released Sky’s voice publicly before contacting Scarlet it would have been a different situation, but they made the decision afterwards. Simply recording Sky’s voice beforehand doesn’t imply a different intent. This isn’t animation where you’re trying to match two mediums and you want the actors recording first. Having a similar voice to work with would have been useful internally to know if they wanted to pay what it might cost to use her voice. reply atleastoptimal 3 hours agorootparentprevthey hired the VA before they even contacted Scarlett. Here’s what probably happened. OpenAI people realize they can do TTS for ChatGPT so they hire some voice actors. Some people point out that it would be cool if it could be as good as it is in Her, especially with 4o on the way, so they decide to contact Scarlett Johansson either to do a voice or just some promotional thing. She declines, but after 4o is released OpenAI realizes they can fairly make the comparison to the movie based on the quality and speed of the voice. Simply subtly referencing the film via an obvious parallel doesn’t constitute deceptive impersonation. reply Retric 24 minutes agorootparentThat seems like an extremely generous interpretation on OpenAI’s behalf especially the timing of when they first think of the movie. Personally there’s many ways they could have been less suspicious from my perspective. Have a large number of voices or the ability to tweet them in many ways and no one voice seems important. Contact many famous people and it would have seemed like a promotional rather than a reference. Have someone lower on the totem pole than the CEO of a multi billionaire dollar corporation trying to make the deal.

They had absolutely no reason to think I would have been at that particular event. And I told them, yup -- it was me asking that question a few years ago.

Adding one extra round to the back and forth of how they got to that point doesn’t really change anything important. reply tptacek 3 hours agorootparentThese are a lot of words that don't do anything to change the fact that the voice alleged to be an imitation of SJ is in fact the natural speaking voice of a professional voice actor hired months before OpenAI contacted SJ, in an open call that mentioned nothing at all about SJ or \"Her\". reply dragonwriter 3 hours agorootparentIt being the “natural speaking voice” of the voice actor is immaterial to what the intent or effect was when it was publicly used, which is what is legally relevant. Yes, that they didn’t record the intent to imitate at the time of the selection is absence of evidence of intent at that time, which is, viewed extremely generously, very weak evidence of absence of intent at that time, but…that’s it. You seem to be looking at this as if right of publicity were like copyright, where what is essentially protected is, well, the act of copying. Right of publicity is a separate area of law, but it is more like trademark than copyright.

The Midler reasoning also rested on how much of the artist's brand recognition (though that's not the term used) was in the voice. Intentional impression of a singer doing that singer's song is very different than \"they hired someone with moderately similar vocal features to ScarJo and Rashida Jones to speak in their own voice.\" reply KennyBlanken 1 hour agorootparentExcept many, many people including a lot of HNers thought Johannson had done the voice. That is exactly what Midler tort is. reply Matticus_Rex 1 hour agorootparentPeople mistaking one person's real voice for another person's real voice is basically nothing like what happened in the Midler case. The Midler case was a vocal impersonation using one of Midler's songs. As discussed in the Midler case, where there's an imitation of the voice, one of the keys is also how much of the likeness/recognition/brand of the person is tied up in their voice, and that's substantially different between a singer's voice on their own song vs. an actress's voice. And given that it's not an impression/impersonation, and literally sounds more like another famous actress than it does ScarJo? This is a great example of facts you'd give to show where the Midler precedent doesn't apply — it's certainly in no way \"exactly\" like Midler. reply calmworm 1 hour agorootparentprevAgreed.

Is she responsible for making sure everyone who hires her very definitely isn't hiring her as a soundalike if she wants her work to get released? I'm sure it would be fine in reality, but if saying \"her\" (when advertising an app you can have a conversation with) is enough to make this impersonation, then the same logic says she's barred from certain roles (or categories of role) because someone more famous got there first. reply criddell 2 hours agorootparentprevDon’t get too hung up on facts like that.

I'm not sure why you're believing OpenAI when they say that the voice actor is who they actually used, and not that after bringing in the voice actor, they didn't just toss the recordings aside, have an intern collect clips of SJ in interviews, and throw that in to the machine?

And some people are so blind to this effect that they've formed what's effectively an army on these OpenAI-ScarJo threads. First, the \"Her\" reference from OpenAI. Then ScarJo saying \"Hey that sounds like me. Even some of my friends think so.\" The voices sound kind of similar in some ways, and dissimilar in other ways. If the voice actor was trying to mimic ScarJo, she didn't do a very good job. Is a casual reference to the title character exemplifying the same concept, a female-voiced AI, in a movie that won best screenplay at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, an IP violation? Even if that were the case, it would be a studio matter and not Scarlett's IP. I am curious why they reached out to ScarJo again 2 days prior, though. Did they want to use her purely for marketing? That seems doubtful, because they'd have to get movie studio clearance to use \"Her\" in official marketing. Did they have a separate model trained on her voice (I wouldn't put this past OpenAI) and were hoping they could get last-minute clearance to use it? This is actually my suspicion. That failed, so they just went with the voice models they already had clearance to use. That's not illegal. It's not even unethical. Anyone can try to train voice models on voice samples they collect. What's a problem is commercial use and representation of likeness.

Is there any reason why Elektra/Asylum didn't license the actual recording copyright[0] to Frito-Lay? I'm assuming Tom Waits (like any other musical artist) wouldn't have veto rights over licensing the recordings, in the same way he apparently couldn't stop Fifth Floor Music from licensing the song itself to Frito-Lay. The thing is, if Frito-Lay had actually licensed the recording, Tom Waits wouldn't have a leg to stand on in court, because of a very funny concept in copyright law called federal preemption. Any claim under any other law - state[1] or federal - that looks and quacks like a copyright is null and void. You only get to sue for copyright with copyright. So you can't, say, trademark a public domain work[2] and then sue people for reproducing it. Misappropriation, false endorsement and publicity rights are very much trademark-shaped laws, so they also lack any jurisdiction over copyright matters. There really just isn't room in the law for \"I license you this work\" but also \"you reproducing this work is a false endorsement\". The public is not confused when copyrighted works are used with permission. However, I'm also not sure why suing for copyright infringement was off the table in the first place. The thing is, when you make a derivative work, you own what you added. If you and me both go to Disney and buy licenses to produce Avengers merch, but I decide to copy your design for the merch, you get to sue me. My license to make my own derivative version of something does not entitle me to copy other derivatives of that same work. So Frito-Lay, having a license to record their own version of Step Right Up, doesn't get the right to copy Tom Waits' recording of Step Right Up. Who knows, maybe recording copyright is a lot narrower than other forms of copyright, but it's hard not to shake the feeling that he could have gone up against Frito-Lay for a lot more. [0] Music copyright has two souls: the copyright over the song itself - lyrics, sheet music, and so on - and a separate copyright over a recording of a specific performance of the song. Originally you could only copyright the song and not the recording. [1] The reason why federal preemption exists is that states started inventing their own recording copyrights for music. Which sounds absolutely wild to lawyers today, who are taught that copyright is inherently a federal question and that states have no say in how it works. What's even more wild is that some state recording copyright laws were actually perpetual, this somehow survived the \"for limited times\" language in the Copyright Clause, we didn't establish federal preemption and shut down these schemes until the 1970s, and we didn't extinguish already extant perpetual recording copyrights until the Music Modernization act in 2018.

It's amusing to think of an AI giving testimony in lawsuit, though. eta: all the folks saying the voice actor doesn't sound exactly like ScarJo and was hired before the negotiations with ScarJo are neglecting to remember: AI is really good at making voice imitations from snippets.

It's amusing to think of an AI giving testimony in lawsuit, though. Perhaps Andrey Karpathy if he has a change if heart - he's been hinted to have led the AI personality effort at OpenAI before he left. If not him, then the discovery process ought to be good. Scarlett's lawyers asked for details on how OpenAI trained the voice, then the voice got pulled ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. If/when the voice returns and this goes to court, we may find out if there was any fine-tuning on ScarJo's interviews/movie audio. reply Theodores 3 hours agoprevInteresting that the law suit was just against Frito Lay rather than PepsiCo. > When I was a kid, if I saw an artist I admired doing a commercial, I'd think, \"Too bad, he must really need the money.\" But now it's so pervasive. It's a virus. Artists are lining up to do ads. The money and exposure are too tantalizing for most artists to decline. Corporations are hoping to hijack a culture's memories for their product. They want an artist's audience, credibility, good will and all the energy the songs have gathered as well as given over the years. They suck the life and meaning from the songs and impregnate them with promises of a better life with their product. Tom Waits did have a point that I think today's content creators need to take onboard. With music it was not always about money for everyone, the love of music was motivating enough, bringing people together for a good time. I do not see many content creators in it 'for the content' and bringing a community together. There are definitely some but the algorithm isn't helping them. > Eventually, artists will be going onstage like race-car drivers covered in hundreds of logos. John, stay pure.

    "commentBody": "Magic UI: UI Library for Design Engineers (magicui.design)176 points by achristmascarl 15 hours agohidepastfavorite77 comments abeppu 3 hours agoSetting aside the slowness, tho I am not a designer, these all strike me as just visual noise. I think animated borders, animated shiny text, animated meteor backgrounds today are no better than an early 2000s page with animated elements. It doesn't help communicate, it just attracts the eye until one learns to tune it out. And it kinda tells me that we're not really learning to build better stuff over the decades. What is the difference between the animated Border Beam in this library and the animated hr in the vintage example of an archived geocities page? https://magicui.design/docs/components/border-beam https://blog.geocities.institute/archives/3879 reply thomascgalvin 2 hours agoparentI agree that a lot of these components are more distracting than useful. I do like the animated border around buttons, though; that would be very useful to draw the eye towards the \"default\" option on a page, as long as it was the only one. reply dvaun 2 hours agoparentprevIf this were splashed across technical docs then I’d agree. That said, we’re not the target audience for this aesthetic. reply rmdashrfv 2 hours agoprevI very much dislike the tweet that OP uses on the Magic UI site that's directed at Linear: \"Companies spend $30,000 and several weeks to get designs like this\" Yes.

I don't even care what it shows due to just how audibly resource heavy it is while showing pretty much nothing other than some simple copy. There's no way in hell opening the main page should cause so much load my computer sounds like I just opened Cyberpunk 2077 or Doom Eternal at max details, especially given the amount actually rendered (I just opened the page, didn't even scroll anywhere!).

But it's audibly resource hungry, because it puts so much load my computer immediately jumped to high power cooling due to how much load it puts. So yes, it's smooth, but that's more because I actually can run both the aforementioned titles at max detail at 4k, not because there's something secret breaking the site for some but not all. reply v3ss0n 5 hours agoparentprevSame here, I can't believe how a UI show case site could be this annoying reply quaintdev 7 hours agoparentprev\"I created animations.

I invested last year at ~$250 when redditors we're posting that \"Nvidia is the best shorting opportunity\" without any of the knowledge of the market.

This happened with a local sports drink maker. It was branded for kids, more healthy, less sugar then Gatorade and energy drinks. Company took off, went public, stock went through the roof for about two years. Blue skies, everything coming up roses, lots of articles in the local business mags and websites. Then their supply chain dried up - a precursor to the pandemic and the founder even said in a startup presentation they were the canary in the coal mine and one of the first businesses in the state to suddenly have their product, packaging, and materials all just evaporate in a matter of weeks. Suddenly they couldn't get product into stores, stores eventually pulled their placement and within three months they were bleeding money horrendously while scrambling to find replacements. Something they were already working on, but soon enough every supplier they'd call had the same answer, they too had no means to ship stuff out and they too were dead in the water. Then two months later the pandemic hit in full force and it was the death knell for the company. Delisted, and bankrupted, they closed up shop about 3 years after being a \"can't lose\" stock and company.

Investing is mostly about not losing money. reply panarky 20 hours agorootparent> Investing is mostly about not losing money Counterintuitively, when I focus hard on not losing money, I become too risk averse, I fail to take appropriate risk, and my returns are stuck in the low single digits. I can't count the times I sold great companies like Apple and Netflix and Tesla years too early because I was afraid to lose money and wanted to \"lock in\" a 50% gain. By focusing on potential for high returns instead of not losing money, with a diverse portfolio of assets that don't correlate perfectly with each other, total returns are much greater even though individual bets can show big losses for months or years. reply lumost 20 hours agorootparentThis is where a diversified portfolio makes sense. It's completely fine to take a \"big bet\" on what would amount to a years worth of returns/cash investment every now and then. But many great opportunities have already been priced appropriately, so the extra concentration of risk doesn't yield a great return.

No wealthy person is diversified. reply filoleg 3 hours agorootparent> To get wealthy, you cannot get diversified Sure, but not diversifying is also one of the most efficient ways to go broke. Which is something that diversifying will make much more difficult. Also, full baloney. I was not diversifying for many years and it indeed made me great money (thanks MSFT). But when I started getting spooked and diversified, guess what? I still ended up doing pretty well, even if it wasn’t on the same level as before (look up MSFT share price change between the start of 2017 and 2021). But it was so much safer and reliable, going broke wasn’t as much of a concern, and I knew I was much more secure in case of a downturn. Winning on risky triple digit percentage gains feel great, but I would rather take much safer diversified 50-60% gains over a 3 year period instead. Not saying that those 50-60% gains are even close to what I would expect from truly safe plays. But safety and risk is a spectrum, and you have more choices than just “fully diversified super safe index funds” and “all-in on one single ticker.” You can adjust and make things diversified and safer than all-inning on a single ticker, while still maintaining some amount of risk that would allow for outsized gains. reply bdangubic 3 hours agorootparentI am not saying anything that you are attempting to dispute here... Your logic is sound and you can get rich doing it. But you won't get wealthy. And getting wealthy does carry higher level of risk, I would think that is common sense. To me diversification goes against all logic because the rule #1 of investing should be that you as a investor KNOW what you are investing in. You can't tell me anyone investing in say S&P 500 has done extensive research on each every of the 500 companies. All they are hoping for is \"hey, these are 500 biggest companies in the World, imma just put my chips here and hope for the best - history tells me that is probably safe bet.\" On the other hand, you can do full-on research into a single or handful of companies and then put your chips there. You can't tell me that putting money in Magnificent-7 say 5 years ago was any riskier than putting money into S&P 500... and yet you could have gotten REALLY wealthy with the former and quite rich with the latter... reply filoleg 1 hour agorootparent> To me diversification goes against all logic because the rule #1 of investing should be that you as a investor KNOW what you are investing in. I largely agree with what you say. However, diversification has degrees, and it doesn’t necessarily mean that you gotta spray and pray across the whole range of S&P500 to be more diversified than the “all-in on a single stock ticker” strategy. Examples: * All in one single stock ticker - no diversification * All in a few different stock tickers that are in the same industry sector (that you are knowledgeable about) - diversified businesses, but not diversified across industries * S&P500 spray and pray - largely diversified Option #2 is imo the solid middle ground, and it gels perfectly fine with your idea that you gotta know what you invest in. Yes, it is riskier than option #3, because it doesn’t account for the scenario where the entire industry sector experiences a downturn. But it is still diversified, still has the potential to make you wealthy, and is not nearly as risky as option #1 (but also not as capped as option #3). reply itchyouch 4 hours agorootparentprevWealthy folks aren't diversified, because they have _control_ (and knowledge) over their particular investment (ie company founders). Stock investors do not have the luxury of control, thus they must diversify. And generally that's what the wealthy do. They go all-in on their own company, grow it to incredible returns, then use those returns to be invested in a diversified manner to grow further. Other stocks, realestate, angel investing, etc. Most of the billionaires are like this.

Their chips are great, on paper. But their software has always been a few generations behind. reply latchkey 19 hours agorootparentThey are moving a lot more quickly now on resolving those issues. It won't happen over night, but the ship is definitely changing course on that. reply mike_hearn 11 hours agorootparentWe've been hearing that line for years, but HN comments are a valuable source of info on where NVDA might go in future. You're the only poster here I could name who is strongly pro-AMD in the AI space. Everyone else seems to put their toes in the water in the hope of being able to get an edge by avoiding NVIDIA's monopoly prices, immediately gets burned by trash software quality and runs away screaming \"never again\". I only dabble in AI stuff but have decades of experience doing quick surface-level quality checks of open source projects. I looked at some of AMD's ROCm repos late last year. Even basic stuff like the documentation for their RNG libraries didn't inspire confidence. READMEs had blatant typos in, everything gave off a feeling of immense lack of effort or care. Looking again today the ROCrand docs do seem improved, at least on the surface, I haven't tried it out for real. But if we cast the net a little wider again, the same problems rear their ugly head. Flash Attention is a pretty important kernel to have if working with LLMs, maybe I'd like one of those for AMD hardware? https://github.com/ROCm/flash-attention We're in luck! An official AMD repo with flash attention in it, great! Except.... the README says at the top: Requirements: CUDA 11.4 and above. We recommend the Pytorch container from Nvidia, which has all the required tools to install FlashAttention. Really? Ah, if we scroll down all the way to the bottom we can find a new section that says \"AMD/ROCm: Prerequisite: MI200 & MI300 GPUs\". Guys, why not just rewrite the README, literally the first thing you see, to put the most important information up front? Why not ensure it makes sense? It takes 10 seconds and is the kind of attention to detail that makes me think the rest of your work will be high quality too. Checking the issue tracker we see people reporting that the fork is very out of date, and that some models just mysteriously don't work with it due to bugs. These issue reports go unanswered for months. And let's not even go there on the hardware compatibility front, everyone already knows what \"AMD support\" really means (not the AMD cards you might actually own) vs what \"NVIDIA support\" means (any device that supports the needed CUDA version, of any size). reply latchkey 3 hours agorootparentMike, thanks for the long thoughtful response. I would never try to defend AMD with regards to them needing to catch up. Even talking with executives at AMD, neither would they. Nobody is trying to pull a fast one on this. What has changed for certain, is their attitude and attention. I just got back from Dell Tech World. Dell was caught off-guard with this AI thing too. It is obvious the only thing that anyone is talking about now is \"ai ai ai ai ai ai\". Give them a bit of time and I think they will start to become competitive over the next few years. It won't happen over night. You won't see README's fixed right away. But one thing that is for certain, they are all at least trying now, instead of pretending it doesn't exist. Whether they will be successful or not, is yet to be seen. I wouldn't even know how to define successful. I don't think anyone is kidding themselves about Nvidia being dominant. But, I'm personally willing to bet on them selling a lot of hardware and working on their software story. You might not, and that is fine too. reply mike_hearn 1 hour agorootparentIt's great that you're pushing AMD forward, no doubt about it! And I'm sure they'll make good progress now. Like I said, the ROCrand repository seems to be in much better shape now. reply latchkey 1 hour agorootparentWhat is telling for me is that ROCm itself is on regular cadence updates. Not just small updates, but actual meaningful fixes and improvements. Not only that, but it is all being done in the open, unlike their competition. Hotz demanded some documentation, they provided it and he still complained. Some people just can't find happiness. Now, whether or not I am pushing them forward is yet to be seen, but at least I'm trying. By positioning myself as a new startup who's trying to help... that will easily garner all their support as well. As I said in another comment, why not let them try too? reply floatinglotus 19 hours agorootparentprevThe number of companies that wish they were a SW company rather than a HW company is very long, and despite all their efforts once they get to a certain size the die is cast. reply ethbr1 19 hours agorootparentThis. Going to GTC and seeing Jensen present demos at the keynote they were coding the night before was... interesting. Either you're the type of company that does that, or you aren't. reply latchkey 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you look at all the open \"AI\" job rec's at AMD right now, they want to be a SW company too. reply Jlagreen 5 hours agorootparentYes, but will they pay as well? Getting good AI talent now is very costly. HW engineers are cheaper. Nvidia has more SW than HW engineers for a reason and the transformation for that started slowly almost 2 decades ago and accelerated 2012 with AlexNet, the first public showcase of a NN running on GPUs. Jensen saw what that meant and transformed the company from that moment focusing on DeepLearning. Nvidia isn't waiting for a market to develop but prefers to create markets by tackling hard and complex problems. It seems that Nvidia got lucky with AI but it was a long lasting preparation for Jensen. reply latchkey 3 hours agorootparentI agree, it is an uphill battle for AMD. Tell me though, what Fortune 500 do you know that is willing to put all their eggs in one basket? It is MBA 101 to not do that. There needs to be alternatives in the space. Why not let them try? reply HDThoreaun 19 hours agorootparentprevBut every big tech compoany is handing nvdia billions a year now. Its not just amd working on amd's software anymore. Now theyve got armies of open source developers from around the industry ready to save their company a boatload if they can get the software working. reply prng2021 18 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t that like saying Apple’s iPads will only maintain a moat for a few more years because MS Surface tablets match in hardware and “only” lag in software? My general point is that the core software (and the software ecosystem built around it) is half of the product. NVIDIA isn’t going to stand still either. reply svnt 14 hours agorootparentB2C and B2B are completely different when it comes to moats. If I can save 20% of my data center costs and cut a price-gouging vendor while bringing the solution in-house at a big tech org I am a hero. Consumers won’t buy a Surface because Microsoft isn’t cool. reply Jlagreen 5 hours agorootparentYou ignore a very important fact which goes above any cost and that is security and stability. A fast unstable or unsafe system belongs into the trash can in any enterprise. B2C will first ask about security and stability. Do you think AWS, Azure and GCP are the cheapest cloud offerings? Of course not, but why do they dominate cloud computing in B2C while price gouging everyone? Because they offer something beyond price and that is security and stability as well as a reliable partner. They also offer support and capacity on a level which a startup CSP will never be able to offer. This is also the reason why all AI accelerator competitors won't be a competition for Nvidia. To beat Nvidia it's not only about beating CUDA, it's about beating Nvidia Enterprise AI suite with it's security offerings and support options. But enterprise business level SW is a level where AMD and others will never go to and will have to rely on Big Tech like MS, Amazon and so on to do that for them. But why should they if they have in-house solutions? Big CSPs developing their own AI accelerators shows you that they understand Nvidia's business model and are trying to compete head on because they understand that Nvidia is attacking them at enterprise level with AI enterprise solutions. And of course any enterprise using Nvidia enterprise SW will automatically use Nvidia HW. Once SW is more spread than HW then it dictates where the direction goes. If MS releases Windows 12 only for ARM then Intel and AMD are immediately screwed and they can't do nothing about that. No enterprise in the world cares if their CAD system runs on x86 or ARM as long as it can be used for the intended use. reply devonkim 20 hours agorootparentprevI don’t really see the software ecosystem catching up that quickly is the thing. Sure, we have some support for hardware like Google’s TPUs and Coral but the field’s practitioners and researchers are oftentimes so behind the curve of general systems work like dealing with the nuts and bolts of libraries and package management that anyone trying to compete against NVIDIA will need to spend a lot of time investing there rather than yet another group of ML engineers that shudder at the thought of packaging and distributing their software to the public and supporting frameworks for years with partnerships and continued investments doing a lot of work that’s basically toil and extremely undesirable for said ML engineers. reply floatinglotus 19 hours agorootparentprevNo. First off, it’s a HW/SW solution and things like CUDA/NCCL/etc make a HUGE difference. Second, the token/watt ratio of every other option is nearly an order of magnitude difference in real world tests. When you add in custom silicon like moronic Grok/Dojo and you see that there aren’t really any close competitors when using custom spins. That is money down the drain IMO. Best bet for most enterprises is to buy 25% AMD and 75% H100 if they can get it. I think Blackwell is potentially a long term generational problem due to power limitations in most data centers for now. reply mnau 21 hours agorootparentprevIsn't CUDA basically hidden behind pyrorch and others? I know that it's touted as the key competitive advantage, but it seems to stem from the fact it actually works, unlike others. Still great advantage, but not a lock in. If competitors get their act together, couldn't they just replace CUDA with another API, all hidden somewhere in the sw stack? reply ein0p 17 hours agorootparentprevFor training workloads? Yes.

Of course. reply deadbabe 21 hours agorootparentprevI don’t get the whole P/E thing. Do people basically say we shouldn’t bother buying anything with a crazy P/E more than 20? Despite the fact that these high P/E companies are now making people lots of money? Wtf? reply rcxdude 18 hours agorootparentIt's more that a high P/E means that the company itself needs to make a lot more money for the long-term shareholders to not be holding an investment that doesn't pay off in the end. You can still make plenty of money speculating on it as it's going up (so long as you sell), or short-selling it as it's going down, but generally speaking it's a sign that the business is being valued the assumption that it will grow by a lot, which is riskier (for example, Tesla's valuation more or less requires that they eventually monopolise the car market or enter and dominate some similarly large market. You can make an assessment yourself as to whether that's likely to happen if you want to make a prediction for how Tesla's value is likely to change over the long term). reply deadbabe 18 hours agorootparentThank you for this well reasoned take. reply snewman 20 hours agorootparentprevA company with a high P/E is by definition not making much money for its shareholders, relative to the size of their investment. Unless you mean that the share price may appreciate. That's absolutely a thing, but it's a dangerous game. Of course plenty of people have made fortunes this way; people have also lost fortunes; I think the advice to steer away from such companies is basically a statement about risk. reply chii 18 hours agorootparent> Unless you mean that the share price may appreciate. this has already happened because the P/E is high!

It’s just one metric that represents past performance. If it’s high, the market believes the stock price will go up. reply rcxdude 18 hours agorootparentNo, P/E being high means the stock market thinks the company's income will grow by a lot in the future. The price may go up or down as those expectations for the future change (a high P/E stock can announce record profits and have the stock go down, if in fact the stock was being priced on the expectation that the profits would be higher than announced). reply nipponese 20 hours agorootparentprevAnd to piggyback on this, these people may have between 0 and 100% understand of the core business. For me personally, it’s a turn off. reply floatinglotus 19 hours agorootparentprevYou need to “get it” because it’s really important. We’re all in here arguing about PE ratios of tech companies reaching 100x. Is that too much? Who knows. For the best tech company in the world? What is the limit?

LLMs are great, but the hype is greater, and I personally don't want to have my income and my investments correlated. NVIDIA may be selling a lot, but their P/E ratio is nearly 80, so that price isn't fundamentals alone. All we need is this ages equivalent to \"perceptrons can't XOR\" and there will be a fast correction. This could go on a long time and I wouldn't be surprised if NVIDIA doubled over the next few years. After all crypto is still doing well despite everyone more or less agreeing it's a scam.

How about analyzing satellite images of warehouse shipments? (which is a thing that is being done today) Not everyone has access to either of those things, yet as far as I am aware, the SEC does not consider that illegal. Why would aggregating credit card transactions be any different, honestly? Capital One already uses that information to direct its own business, much the same way. I wish this SEC would have made it clear why this was a problem. reply kortilla 17 hours agorootparentprevThe only leg the SEC had to stand on in this complaint is a very specific clause from the employee agreement that says not to use this information for trading. reply foobarqux 20 hours agorootparentprevThis is false, you are breaking your duty of confidentiality towards your employer. Read the numerous Matt Levine columns about this. I don't know that the specific information collected in this qualifies as material information but it seems like it might. reply kortilla 17 hours agorootparentNo, it has to be explicitly outlined in the employee agreement if you’re not allowed to share some of the information. “Duty of confidentiality” is not a magic thing that just exists. All of the cases where people have been busted (e.g. the capital one credit card transactions) are because the SEC has an exact quote from the employee agreement that says something like “don’t use this mega database to do trading”. If your employee agreement doesn’t have something explicitly barring you from noticing racks of incoming inventory and using that information, then it’s not insider trading. reply foobarqux 17 hours agorootparentYou are wrong. The duty of trust doesn't even require a formal contract, girlfriend/boyfriend qualifies for example. Also see point 4 from https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-26/watch-... for example where there is no discussion of explicit duty of confidentiality; it is presumed in an employment relationship. reply NoboruWataya 21 hours agorootparentprev\"My company bought their product\" does not sound like material non-public information.

There's a somewhat famous legend of a trade Peter Lynch did based, in some part, upon his wife commenting on buying pantyhose at the supermarket. I'll let you read for yourself - \"I had a great luck company called Hanes. They test marketed a product called L'Eggs in Boston and I think in Columbus, Ohio, maybe three or four markets. And Carolyn, ah, brought this product home and she was buying and she said, \"It's great.\" And she almost got a black belt in shopping. She's a very good shopper. If we hadn't had these three kids, she now -- when Beth finally goes off to college, I think we'll be able to resume her training. But she's a very good shopper and she would buy these things. She said, \"They're really great.\" And I did a little bit of research. I found out the average woman goes to the supermarket or a drugstore once a week. And they go a woman's specialty store or department store once every six weeks. And all the good hosiery, all the good pantyhose is being sold in department stores. They were selling junk in the supermarkets. They were selling junk in the drugstores. So this company came up with a product. They rack-jobbed it, they had all the sizes, all the fits, a down they never advertised price. They just advertised \"This fits. You'll enjoy it.\" And it was a huge success and it became my biggest position and I always worried somebody'd come out with a competitive product, and about a year-and-a-half they were on the market another large company called Kaiser-Roth came out with a product called No Nonsense. They put it right next to L'eggs in the supermarket, right next to L'eggs in the drugstore. I said, \"Wow, I gotta figure this one out.\" So I remember buying -- I bought 48 different pairs at the supermarket, colors, shapes, and sizes. They must have wondered what kind of house I had at home when I got to the register. They just let me buy it. So I brought it into the office. I gave it to everybody. I said, \"Try this out and come back and see what's the story with No Nonsense.\" And people came back to me in a couple weeks and said, \"It's not as good.\" That's what fundamental research is. So I held onto Hanes and it was a huge stock and it was bought out by Consolidated Foods, which is now called Sara Lee, and it's been a great division of that company.

So because Nvidia cards were relatively cheap compared to the last few years because of cryptomining, of course Nvidia is in dire straits and will be left to the mercy of the almighty gamer. The en-vogue group think on Reddit now is to show total disdain towards all AI, and insist that the 'AI PC' is solely a marketing tactic for Intel, Dell and Microsoft to sell more computers, mostly because it really seems most people on reddit don't do any work to appreciate the benefits AI can provide to productive people. reply jejeyyy77 18 hours agoparentprevso many folks here have industry knowledge that is as valuable as insider knowledge yet they don't have fortitude to act on it.

Probably not. What do you specifically value Nvidia at? Not the share price. Your own calculation. You, AnotherGoodName, are going to buy Nvidia outright. You're basically Elon Musk, and you think you can create better AI chips. You don't know what that number is? Then you don't intimately know the value of the company.

One of two things happens: 1. The AI boom goes bust. Nvidia sales and/or margins crater. The stock craters with it. 2. The AI boom is the real deal. Companies aren’t stupid and won’t keep paying Nvidia these prices forever. Pretty soon hardware and software architectures are standardized enough that anyone who can get onboard with TSMC, Samsung, or Intel can churn out hardware optimized for the right few functions and sell for a faction of the price. Nvidia can still be an innovator but they won’t be able to sell “bread and butter” products at these prices. Sales and/or margins crater, as does the stock. reply MyFedora 19 hours agoparentNVIDIA got lucky that modern computer architecture happens to favor GPUs for AI workloads.

Also, it's a hedge against China invading Taiwan and blowing up TSMC, in which case it would probably skyrocket to $100+. In the meantime Intel pays nice dividends. reply HDThoreaun 19 hours agorootparentprevIntel literally cant fail because of national security. The government will continuously bail them out which I think is a pretty big advantage, giving them time to figure something out. Theyre cheap as fuck too so tons of upside reply abduhl 20 hours agorootparentprev$869 sale means you sold between March 2024 and last week. Let’s game this out: 100 shares of NVDA at 453 pared down to just profits from 869 sale would mean holding about 48 shares and selling 52 shares. After today’s after hours movement your invested profit would be worth about $48k, or about $6300 more than when you cashed out your initial investment ($41712). You take that same $41712 and buy INTC between March and now. If it was bought in March then you’re in for something like $43/share or 970 shares. Intel has been sliding since April and is now at $31. Your profit from NVDA has shrunk by nearly 30%. In the worst case (you bought in March rather than April), you’ve given up near $19k in profit by following your convictions. Your gains have gone from 115% (had you held) to potentially as low as 70%. I guess it’s all house money anyways though, right? reply bobo_legos 20 hours agorootparentI have a 6 figure profit in NVDA shares right now. Cost basis is something like $100. I have considered selling( or at what price I would sell). The problem I have is what could I possibly buy with that profit? Intel hasn't shown that they have a real plan. The move in META seems to have already happened. I don't trust that Alphabet has any idea what they're doing. I could buy more Microsoft or Amazon shares I guess. I wouldn't throw money at these software stocks like Snowflake or the SNOWs of the world. AAPL might be a play if I have the conviction that Tim Cook has an AI plan in place.

When I was selling at $869 I would not know how it will go. And, as a matter of fact, a week or two after I sold NVDA dipped to $700, although temporarily. So, it's just a matter of personal risk tolerance, I guess. reply Jlagreen 4 hours agoparentprevYou mean the same companies who are paying AWS, Azure and GCP a lot of money for decades despite there being cheap alternatives?

To justify current valuation revenues must continue to grow next 4-5 years until plateauing while Nvidia profit margin gradually declines to something normal, like 30%. High growth is fragile. The value of Nvidia has dropped 50% multiple times in the past. Recression, or temporary oversupply, anything can mess it. reply noobermin 12 hours agoparentprevThis thought is strange. This very moment is the moment of success. Perhaps it can grow more, who knows, but a maximum declines on either side, that's literally what a maximum is.

The only reason it becomes profound is because a lot of people are just that stupid. reply UncleMeat 21 hours agoparentprevA significant question is what \"pretty soon\" means.

This AI bubble could be burst by a better cheaper product more dedicated to the task or a realisation that the issues with AI just can't be solved and a cooling off of the market hype. What I fear is that Nvidia sees no value in its basic graphics cards any more or wants a lot more for them because they could sell that wafer space to businesses for more $.

Where will they get their AI compute? I tell you where, from Nvidia direclty or from a CSP renting it to them. Oh wait, aren't MS, Amazon and Google such CSP? Oh right! Could that mean that Nvidia sells GPUs to CSPs which then rent it to customers or rather companies which aren't CSPs? So how do these other companies use Nvidia's GPUs from renting? Let me guess, maybe Nvidia Enterprise AI SW suite? Bingo! And how does Nvidia benefit from these other companies? Or right, Nvidia gets $4500 license fee per GPU if a company uses Nvidia Enterprise AI solution. Oh wait, does that mean that Nvidia might be into building a SaaS business? Correct, but psst... nobody listens to Nvidia management so only few have a clue. Clearly, Nvidia is earning money only from HW to use it for hobbies like Clara, Isaac, DriveSim, Omniverse and many more... GTC was way more about SW development than HW but that was just show to keep people entertained. Nvidia also is a nice HW company employing more SW engineers than HW engineers so that SW engineers also get a chance for work. reply sumedh 7 hours agoparentprevIsnt one of the reason to buy all this compute is to attract skilled AI people who want all that compute power, makes it easier to hire them. reply theGnuMe 17 hours agoparentprevThe race to build their own chips vs buy nvidia… I imagine they do both.

They are making 78% of margin on those chips - I would think that that leaves a lot of bargaining power to TSMC. They would loose much less than Nvidia. reply nabla9 21 hours agorootparentYou can't do shakedowns for your second best customer. Nvidia works also with Samsung for new 3nm nodes. Prices are defined by the profit margins of Nvidia's closest competitor (AMD 4.89%.) reply TheAlchemist 20 hours agorootparentWhy not ? Nvidia may be working with Samsung, but they don't have any alternative for now. So my understanding is, that TSMC currently has the monopoly on producing Nvidia chips, and Nvidia obviously has the monopoly on selling those chips. And somehow, Nvidia is extracting 99% of profits from that situation, while TSMC is getting close to nothing. My understanding of game theory is that it should be way closer to an even split. Could you elaborate on why the prices are defined by AMD margins ? I'm obviously missing something, but can't see what. reply purple_ferret 20 hours agorootparentprev>You can't do shakedowns for your second best customer.

So TSMC would have to increase prices for everyone, but then for some it would be too expensive and so they would lose those customers. reply nabla9 20 hours agorootparentThat's not how it works. You can't resell. Nvidia engineers work shoulder to shoulder with TSMC to squeeze everything from the architecture even before the fab is build. TSMC makes custom job for their best customers.

    "originBody": "News → Car Tech Carmakers Will Give Your Location to Police Without a Warrant, Senators Say Eight manufacturers reportedly told Congress they’d comply with a request for driver data without a court order. BY JAMES GILBOYPUBLISHED MAY 15, 2024 5:05 PM EDT NEWS lupengyu via Getty Images SHARE 0 JAMES GILBOY View James Gilboy's Articles _JamesGilboy jamesgilboy Connected cars' data security has become a political battleground in recent years as new cars have become ever-more high-tech. Consumers have good reasons to want their data kept private, and on the surface, the auto industry is an ally on that front. But behind the curtain, the industry is reportedly playing fast and loose with customers' data, selling it or reportedly even handing it over to police despite promising not to. Connected cars have been promised to bring about a variety of quality-of-life improvements, both to car ownership and our experiences on the road. They're touted as preventing theft, streamlining service, improving road safety, and smoothing out traffic. But the drawbacks are manifesting just as quickly, in forms such as privacy issues, stealth recalls, and even enabling stalking. Consumers have other reasons to worry, too: Insurers are pressing harder for vehicle data, and privacy is only becoming more valuable in an increasingly authoritarian surveillance state. The federal government has expressed concern too, with the Biden administration asserting that allowing Chinese EVs to be sold in the U.S. poses national security risks. BYD King, a Chinese hybrid sedan. BYD The industry is aware of the nation's privacy concerns, which is why many automakers signed the Alliance for Automotive Innovation's Consumer Privacy Protection Principles in 2014. Signatories of this lobby group's document promised not to hand over location, biometric, or driving behavior data to third parties without driver approval—with some exceptions. One of said exceptions requires police to obtain a court order (or a warrant, a subcategory of court order) to obtain driver info. But now, eight automakers have reportedly admitted to Congress that they'd go against their word when push comes to shove. Automotive News reports that Toyota, Subaru, Mazda, Nissan, Kia, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen have told Congress they would hand over drivers' data if faced with a subpoena. There's a major difference between a subpoena and a court order according to the APA Practice Organization, which says \"a subpoena is a lawyer's assertion that she/he is entitled to the requested information, while a court order determines that the lawyer is in fact entitled to it.\" In other words, a subpoena is a request for information; a court order is a judge or magistrate backing that request. Chris Ryan via Getty Images Acquiring location data through subpoena could be easily weaponized by a legal system under escalating scrutiny for its widespread abuse of power. To at least two Senators though, it also constitutes deceptive marketing on automakers' parts. \"Automakers have not only kept consumers in the dark regarding their actual practices, but multiple companies misled consumers for over a decade by failing to honor the industry’s own voluntary privacy principles,\" Senators Ron Wyden and Ed Markey reportedly wrote to the Federal Trade Commission. \"Vehicle location data can be used to identify Americans who have traveled to seek an abortion in another state, attended protests, support groups for alcohol, drug, and other types of addiction, or identify those of particular faiths, as revealed through trips to places of worship.\" This means a connected car ownership can make someone far easier to track than via their phone, whose location data generally still requires a warrant to obtain. It's also hypocritical of AAI members, who have previously lobbied against a right-to-repair bill on the purported basis of consumers' location data falling into the wrong hands. The auto industry's speaking out of both sides of its mouth here, showing many of its members can't be trusted with matters of consumer privacy. It may be best to consider the topic a matter of rhetoric and marketing to some manufacturers, rather than a cause they'll actually stand up for. With how much private information their products can gather on us, we should all be concerned regardless of whether we own a connected car. After all, when the time comes for many Americans to replace their current vehicle, there won't be many other options. Got a tip or question for the author?

    "commentBody": "Carmakers Will Give Your Location to Police Without a Warrant, Senators Say (thedrive.com)173 points by PaulHoule 23 hours agohidepastfavorite171 comments mikece 23 hours agoThere is a growing number of cases where the salesperson will activate OnStar (or a non-GM equivalent) without asking or telling the buyer about it. As far as I know, there is no (legal) way to deactivate OnStar or similar GPS trackers built into cars. Of course if you're driving in a city the proliferation of ALPRs is so pervasive that your movements are being tracked in real-time even if you're driving a 1958 Ford F-series truck. reply JohnFen 23 hours agoparent> As far as I know, there is no (legal) way to deactivate OnStar or similar GPS trackers built into cars. I'm not aware of any law (in the US) that prohibits you from disabling these things in a vehicle you own. Is it actually illegal? reply ru552 23 hours agorootparentIt's not illegal, it's just that it doesn't allow it in the UI. Who do you call to have that service disabled? No one knows. The best you can do is talk to someone and have the auto renewal turned off. That doesn't turn off the existing service until the renewal period hits though. reply JohnFen 22 hours agorootparentIt doesn't matter what the UI allows, I'm talking about physically disabling it. I wouldn't trust a software setting about this. > Who do you call to have that service disabled? No one knows. If you're not too squeamish about this sort of thing, you could likely find out how to disable this yourself in your vehicle with a web search. If you aren't comfortable with that, I'd bet that any serious motorhead would likely be able to help, as would any independent auto shop. reply PaulHoule 22 hours agorootparentprevThere's got to be a fuse to pull. reply silisili 22 hours agorootparentOn my truck there is, but disabling the module also disables the whole infotainment. You could probably just go aftermarket but seems like a lot of work. reply neuralRiot 22 hours agorootparentUnplug the GPS or the cellular network antenna. You might get an antenna error but it should keep working. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 22 hours agorootparentprevIIRC in some vehicles it is part of the ECM and can't be disabled without also effectively disabling the entire engine. reply JohnFen 22 hours agorootparentThere still has to be an antenna somewhere in a location where it can avoid all the EM interference. It seems like disconnecting that would be sufficient. reply nrdgrrrl 23 hours agorootparentprevSurely you can find the GPS antenna and disconnect it? reply Lammy 22 hours agorootparentBetter to replace it with an equivalent resistor so the ECU can't tell the difference between no-antenna and no-signal. reply mordae 21 hours agorootparentOr maybe just desolder the one capacitor between the physical antenna and LNA. Provided it's not in a can. reply anonymousnotme 20 hours agorootparentprevIs the GPS two way or one way? I had the impression that the GPS signals went from satellite to earth, but the receivers did not send a signal to the GPS satellite. I thought onstar connected the cellular network. If I have the wrong information and somebody has more specifics about this, I would really like to know. From reading the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnStar Looks like the cellular network is used. Is the cellular antenna and the GPS antenna the same or are there two physical antenna? If so, then I assume one can just disconnect it. Since according to the article it says 4g. Normally cellular providers discontinue old network, 2G and 3G network have been taken down in recent years. Does anybody know when 4g network will be removed/disabled? I did find: https://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c8-general-discussion/4... https://www.silveradosierra.com/threads/disable-on-star.7196... If the 4g network is taken down at some point, then whatever functionality that uses it will be disabled as well. So, one would think that perhaps that part of the system should be able to be replaced. If so, can't one just remove that part of the system? It is probably hard to remove, because if it is easy, then theft system is not as good. One more thought, in California one can request a copy of one's data and also request that it be deleted. Has anybody in CA requested a copy of all the data that has been collected? How much data per month or day does it collected? Has anybody requested that their data be deleted? Would this make it difficult the manufacturer to train the driving assistance AI if enough people requested that their data be deleted? reply bathtub365 14 hours agorootparentIf you disconnect the GPS antenna the car won’t be able to get a GPS position to report via OnStar. reply ranger_danger 13 hours agorootparentprevGPS is receive-only for civilians. The sharkfin style antenna pod is typically a PCB with several different antennas on it: https://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/B1188507781/Shark-fin... But for most cars today, removing the antenna would require removing the dash and radio, possibly voiding the warranty or a lease agreement if you have one. Interesting comment about AI training data... surely that would violate GDPR. reply CivBase 23 hours agorootparentprevYou own the hardware. But in the modern world we do not own the software that allows us to make use of the hardware. If deactivating OnStar requires a modification to the car's software, I can definitely see how it could effectively be illegal to deactivate. In the world of modern tech, the concept of ownership is practically dead. But I don't know if a modification to the software is actually necessary or if that's what OP was getting at. Just speculating. reply JohnFen 23 hours agorootparentNo need to mess with the software to deactivate these things. Just yank a fuse, disconnect the antenna, or -- worst case -- physically break the support circuitry. reply ranger_danger 13 hours agorootparent\"just\" is often quite complicated and expensive to do these days. reply exe34 23 hours agorootparentprevthe issue is that eventually they'll just make the car not start without it. it's like your inkjet printer refusing to print black and white because it's run out of yellow. reply JohnFen 22 hours agorootparentEventually isn't now, though. We'll have to cross that bridge when it happens. Personally, the inclusion of surveillance as a standard feature in cars means that I won't buy cars made so recently. It's easier to do that than to worry about disabling stuff. If that becomes impossible for some reason, I suppose that my driving days are over. reply hiatus 22 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like it would have profound safety implications. reply CivBase 22 hours agorootparentPretty hard to get into a vehicle collision if you can't start the vehicle. reply hiatus 21 hours agorootparentPretty easy to suffer some sort of injury if you're stranded and your car won't turn on. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 22 hours agorootparentprevHow so? reply hiatus 21 hours agorootparentTurn off the car in a place without service, can't turn it back on? reply Xirgil 23 hours agorootparentprevBut if you own the hardware there's nothing to legally prevent you from severing the power to whatever sensors/hardware onstar is using, no? reply sidewndr46 23 hours agorootparentthe car may not even start, or may disable virtually all functionality until the problem is fixed if you do that reply CivBase 23 hours agorootparentprevSure. As long as the software continues to work despite whatever you broke or disabled. It all depends on how forgiving the software is and how integrated the hardware is. If manufacturers really want to collect this data, they currently have the power to stop you. reply Zigurd 23 hours agoparentprevIt looks like OnStar and other systems are on a dedicated fuse. Pulling that fuse would disable remote access to data. This would not disable onboard logging. Real location privacy on a journey would also require stashing your phone and toll box in a shielded bag and avoiding license plate readers. reply reaperman 21 hours agorootparentThe interstate also has “traffic counters” which pick up unique bluetooth IDs that are broadcast from each car’s center console infotainment system. There’s a shocking number of ways to track a person in their vehicle before we even get down to the license plate. If most people here on HN don’t know about them, the general public is obviously completely unaware. https://tti.tamu.edu/researcher/now-taking-it-to-the-streets... reply ssl-3 20 hours agorootparentEven tires often have RFID, and have for a long time. And even the TPMS sensors in valve stems: They go on their merry way, broadcasting their unique ID (and tire pressure) to anyone who cares to listen. It's all quite real, and it is pervasive. The only question is: Who, if anyone, is listening and keeping track? reply ranger_danger 13 hours agorootparentprevNow if only this data could be used as an alibi in court. Sorry your honor, your government's own data proves I could not have been at Jimmy's house where this crime took place. reply steelframe 23 hours agorootparentprevYou can probably just enable Airplane Mode on your phone and expect that to work fine. reply Zigurd 23 hours agorootparentIt's been since 3G that I delved into baseband specs in any depth, but I would not trust a powered up phone not to be commanded to connect to a network. reply adamomada 22 hours agorootparentCouldn’t this easily be proven by monitoring transmission power from the device? There are all sorts of people who go on vacation and use the switch to avoid roaming charges. It would be plainly obvious to those people that their supposedly offline phone went online when they look at their bill. Or is there some secret apn bypass? reply Zigurd 19 hours agorootparentDepending on how careful you are and what equipment you've got on hand, you might be able to detect that going on, but I think \"easily\" is a stretch. If there is a secret involved in this it would be undocumented commands sent by the network to phones that then interpret them as commands to connect to the network, plus baseband processors the periodically look for such commands. They don't radiate, so very little power is used, but they should be entirely dormant. reply ranger_danger 3 hours agorootparentprevI ask this all the time but have yet to find anyone that has actually measured it. According to Snowden, basebands are still powered and operational even when the main application OS (android/ios/etc.) are shut down. And a non-removable battery sure doesn't help that. Plus, he also says that the baseband often has its own separate connections to the GPS, microphone and camera and can operate them without the application OS involved. If the baseband is still powered, I can only assume it is simply sending (or responding to) periodic commands that do not require network authorization, which could possibly still let the network know where you are even without involving any roaming charges. reply richjdsmith 21 hours agorootparentprevOr even a phone that is \"off\". Newer iphones (11+) can be found through the FindMy network, even when the device is off. https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/21/ios-15-here-are-the-devices-t... reply kevin_thibedeau 22 hours agorootparentprevModern cars have their own internal GPS and cellular links. Even if they don't have mapping, it's probably still there, always on for tracking and compass bearing. reply ssl-3 21 hours agorootparentGPS is even used for automatic HVAC controls in some vehicles. A light sensor is used determine the amount of sunlight streaming and heating the interior. GPS data is used to help calculate the angle of the sun, and determine which areas are likely to be heated the most, and thus needs more cooling. A compass can be used to make it work even when the car is stationary (when GPS heading is unavailable). A singular interior temperature sensor can be used for feedback, injecting some truth to balance things out. It may seem far fetched or even fanciful -- functionality that only exists on very expensive or exclusive brands, or very new vehicles. But as long as the GPS receiver and nav system exist on a network, and multi-zone HVAC is a thing in a given chassis, then the rest is mostly just software that is free (for the manufacturer) to copy and use. Thus, Honda has been doing this stuff for at least twenty years now on fairly pedestrian vehicles. reply ranger_danger 3 hours agorootparentGot any sources? reply jandrese 23 hours agoparentprevWhat's illegal about removing the fuse for the OnStar system from your own car? Certainly the doctrine of first sale applies here? reply crmd 23 hours agorootparentOn late model Toyotas, pulling the fuse for the DCM (Data Communication Module - component that sends nonconsensual telemetry back to Toyota) also disables the car's bluetooth microphone and front right speaker. There is a procedure to disable the DCM and restore at least the speaker, but it involves partial disassembly of the dashboard. reply JohnFen 22 hours agorootparent> also disables the car's bluetooth microphone and front right speaker.

My concern is more that it's ripe for parallel construction in cases that otherwise wouldn't make it out of the gate. reply ChrisMarshallNY 23 hours agorootparentFrom what I understand, LPRs are very precise; especially the car-mounted ones that I see around here. The biggest issue with LPRs, is the private corporations that run the infrastructure, sell the data to non-law enforcement people. Basically, license plates were designed to give authorities the ability to match the car with an owner, and are designed to be public, but the matching data is supposed to be behind a lock. LPRs simply supercharge the collection of the data, but they have contracted out the matching, and those contractors seem to be using what is supposedly a “locked” ability, to make money. reply google_expat 23 hours agorootparentPrecise but not accurate. I've gotten multiple tickets for running tolls from San Francisco that show commercial work vans or trucks (one of which didn't even have a license plate on it), despite having a compact car several states over that's never even entered that dystopian city/state. The big databases are unlikely to retain pictures that may be used to prove innocence -- so coupled with the legal principle that computers are presumed to be operating correctly these are nothing more than automatic probable cause machines with no upside. reply moduspol 22 hours agorootparentprevA LPR will tell you when a car was at a specific spot, but it won't tell you where a car is at all times.

Any attempt to go through a third party or do it yourself will cause significant damage to the front end that will cost more to repair. The amount of spying and protectionism built into these cars makes me uncomfortable with owning one. While there are manufacturers like Aptera who are claiming to want to buck this trend by offering mail-order replacement parts, I'm convinced that I should just weld together my own rolling chassis and build a modern electric horseless carriage. It's insurance and safety concerns that give me pause. People in my state drive like maniacs on the best of days.

Now that it is practical: maybe we want that? Cars are multi-ton, incredibly-expensive pieces of hardware that operate on shared roadways. There are about 42,000 deaths related to operating them each year. Increased tracking would simplify the challenges of * Finding stolen vehicles * Discovering the truth in accidents * Identifying unsafe drivers and removing them from the road * Identifying unsafe areas of the roadway and improving them Perhaps there is previously-inaccessible net societal good in not treating cars as a private space when they're operating on public roads that we should be tapping? There's already precedent for it; the legal reason the cops need a much lower standard to search your car than search your house is, practically, it's much easier to commit a crime and then exit the jurisdiction because the vehicle is mobile. So perhaps we should extrapolate that reasoning. Perhaps rights to privacy should be curtailed in the operation of large vehicles on public roadways.

    "originBody": "Voyager 1 Resumes Sending Science Data from Two Instruments Voyager 1 has resumed returning science data from two of its four instruments for the first time since a computer issue arose with the spacecraft in November 2023. The mission’s science instrument teams are now determining steps to recalibrate the remaining two instruments, which will likely occur in the coming weeks. The achievement marks significant progress toward restoring the spacecraft to normal operations. In April, after five months of troubleshooting since the original computer issue, the mission was able to get the spacecraft to begin returning usable engineering data about the health and status of its onboard systems, including the science instruments. On May 17, the team sent commands to the 46-year-old spacecraft that enabled it to resume sending science data to Earth. With Voyager 1 located more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from its home planet, it takes light over 22 1/2 hours to reach the spacecraft, and 22 1/2 hours for a signal to return to Earth. As a result, the team had to wait nearly two days to see if their commands were successful. The plasma wave subsystem and magnetometer instrument are now returning usable science data. As part of the effort to restore Voyager 1 to normal operations, the mission is continuing work on the cosmic ray subsystem and low energy charged particle instrument. (Six additional instruments aboard Voyager 1 are either no longer working or were turned off after the probe’s flyby of Saturn.) Normal operations were interrupted last year when Voyager 1 began sending a signal back to Earth that contained no science or engineering data. The team eventually determined the issue stemmed from a small portion of corrupted memory in the flight data subsystem, one of the spacecraft’s three computers. Among other things, this system is designed to package data from the science instruments as well as engineering data about the health and status of the spacecraft before that information is sent to Earth. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, will celebrate 47 years of operations later this year. They are NASA’s longest-operating spacecraft as well as the first and only spacecraft to explore outside the heliosphere. Created by the Sun, this bubble of magnetic fields and solar wind pushes against the interstellar medium, an ocean of particles created by stars that have exploded elsewhere in the Milky Way galaxy. Both probes flew past Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2 also flew past Uranus and Neptune.

I think it's an easy argument to make. I'm very impressed about figuring out this problem and working around it. It would take 50 years to repeat, because it would take so long to send another mission that far out (47 years, depending on how much delta-V we could give it), and the odds that it survives that long is low anyway. We are too poor, too involved in arguing about other stuff to come close.

I think it's an easy argument to make. I can't really agree. Voyager 1 & 2 have been extraordinarily successful machines but that's aided by the simplicity of their mission and their design. The core scientific purpose of the missions (visit and survey the outer planets) has been repeated many times over by other craft (Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini–Huygens, New Horizons, Juno) with greatly improved instruments. Compare Voyager to the Large Hadron Collider, the Manhattan Project, sequencing the genome, or even the Opportunity rover. All of these projects were successful despite being massively more complex undertakings. It's comforting to know that the human race will leave a trace beyond the gravity well of our own star, but hurling a chunk of metal away from the sun is not an inherently great achievement. reply NotSammyHagar 56 minutes agorootparentI'm not going to argue about the many other fantastic achievements. How about figuring out the atom, the components of that, then the subcomponents of electrons, etc. That's pretty amazing, figuring out electromagnetism in general, then using all those things together. Figuring out evolution and how it basically worked, well before we could use all the other discoveries to figure out the actual mechanism of genes. reply SlightlyLeftPad 18 hours agorootparentprevDoes simplicity in their design really detract from the feat of their accomplishments? There’s a tendency to gravitate towards expensive big budget missions. Is success measured by the biggest budget or the complexity of the problem?

Yes, the main feat has been repeated - later. For their time, the Voyager probes are state of the art devices, and their design has clearly proven durable and forward-thinking. (Not an entirely empty opinion, either - a couple of months ago I went on a bender and read journal write-ups of bugs they fixed over time, etc.) Sure, with this line of thinking perhaps you'd have to compare them more with the Pyramids or Antikythera-type devices, and I think I'd be comfortable with that. reply tomxor 18 hours agorootparentprev> but that's aided by the simplicity of their mission and their design.

    "originBody": "BB(3, 4) > Ack(14) May 22, 2024 Pavel has found a 3-state 4-symbol TM which can compute an “Ackermann-level” function and halts with exactly ( 2 ↑ 15 5 ) + 14 non-zero symbols on the tape. With a number this large, Knuth up-arrow format is becoming a bit awkward, so we can approximate this bound as: 𝐵 𝐵 ( 3 , 4 ) > 𝐴 𝑐 𝑘 ( 14 ) where 𝐴 𝑐 𝑘 ( 14 ) is the 14th Ackermann number defined as: 𝐴 𝑐 𝑘 ( 𝑛 ) = 𝑛 ↑ 𝑛 𝑛 As far as I know, this is the first TM found “in the wild” that is able to simulate an Ackermann-level function. The Machine 1RB3LB1RZ2RA_2LC3RB1LC2RA_3RB1LB3LC2RC0 1 2 3 A 1RB 3LB 1RZ 2RA B 2LC 3RB 1LC 2RA C 3RB 1LB 3LC 2RC It halts with final configuration 0 ∞ 3 2 𝑔 15 3 ( 0 ) + 1 2 16 1 Z> 0 ∞ which leaves exactly 𝜎 = 2 𝑔 15 3 ( 0 ) + 18 = ( 2 ↑ 15 5 ) + 14 non-zero symbols on the tape. (The function 𝑔 𝑘 ( 𝑚 ) will be defined below). Attribution This TM was discovered by Pavel Kropitz (@uni) and shared on Discord on 25 Apr 2024. His code was not able to specify a human-readable bound on the TM score and it was simply specified as Halt(SuperPowers(13)) indicating 13 layers of inductive rules needed to prove it. He began a validation of this result using my new “Inductive Proof Validator” (see discussion at end of article). I completed this validation and was able to extract the precise definition of 𝑔 𝑘 𝑛 ( 𝑚 ) on 20 May 2024 (Discord link) and used that to get a bound of 𝜎 > 2 ↑ 15 3 . Matthew House (@LegionMammal978) discovered on 22 May 2024 (Discord link) the remarkably simple closed form evaluation: 𝑔 𝑘 𝑛 ( 0 ) = 2 ↑ 𝑘 ( 𝑛 + 2 ) 2 − 2 which led me to rewrite this article with exact values for 𝜎 ! Analysis Let 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 𝑛 , 𝑚 ) = 0 ∞ 3 2 𝑚 + 1 2 𝑘 A> 1 𝑛 then we can prove that0 ∞ A> 0 ∞ → 241 𝐵 ( 16 , 3 , 0 ) 2 0 ∞ 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 𝑛 , 𝑚 ) → 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 0 , 𝑔 𝑘 − 1 𝑛 ( 𝑚 ) ) if 𝑘 ≥ 1 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 0 , 𝑚 ) 2 → 1 0 ∞ 3 2 𝑚 + 1 2 𝑘 1 Z> where 𝑔 0 ( 𝑚 ) = 𝑚 + 1 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 ( 𝑚 ) = 𝑔 𝑘 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 0 ) Proof by Double Induction This TM is remarkably simple in the sense that its behavior can be almost completely described by one single rule: 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 𝑛 , 𝑚 ) → 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 0 , 𝑔 𝑘 − 1 𝑛 ( 𝑚 ) ) but that rule is a whopper requiring double induction to prove! Lemma 1: For all 𝑘 ≥ 1 : 3 2 𝑘1 𝑛 + 1 → 1 0 ∞ 3 2 𝑚 + 1 2 𝑘 + 11 2 𝑚 + 2 3 1 𝑛 = 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 2 𝑚 + 2 , 0 ) 3 1 𝑛 → 𝐵 ( 𝑘 , 0 , 𝑔 𝑘 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 0 ) ) 3 1 𝑛 by Ind. Hyp. 𝐻 𝑘 = 0 ∞ 3 𝑔 𝑘 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 0 ) 2 𝑘 A> 3 1 𝑛 → 1 0 ∞ 3 𝑔 𝑘 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 0 ) 2 𝑘 + 1 A> 1 𝑛 = 𝐵 ( 𝑘 + 1 , 𝑛 , 𝑔 𝑘 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 0 ) ) = 𝐵 ( 𝑘 + 1 , 𝑛 , 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 ( 𝑚 ) ) → 𝐵 ( 𝑘 + 1 , 0 , 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 ( 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 ( 𝑚 ) ) ) by Ind. Hyp. 𝐻 𝑛 = 𝐵 ( 𝑘 + 1 , 0 , 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 + 1 ( 𝑚 ) ) QED Exact Values Through what appears to be a remarkable series of coincidences, there is a relatively simple closed form evaluation of 𝑔 𝑘 using only Knuth up-arrows and arithmetic: Theorem: For all 𝑘 ≥ 0 , 𝑚 ≥ 0 : 2 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 ( 𝑚 ) + 4 = 2 ↑ 𝑘 ( 2 𝑚 + 4 ) (where we define 𝑎 ↑ 0 𝑏 = 𝑎 𝑏 ) Proof by Induction on 𝑘 : Base case ( 𝑘 = 0 ):𝑔 1 ( 𝑚 ) = 𝑔 0 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 0 ) = 2 𝑚 + 2 2 𝑔 1 ( 𝑚 ) + 4 = 2 ( 2 𝑚 + 2 ) + 4 = 4 𝑚 + 8 = 2 ↑ 0 ( 2 𝑚 + 4 ) Inductive case: Assume ∀ 𝑚 ≥ 0 : 2 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 ( 𝑚 ) + 4 = 2 ↑ 𝑘 ( 2 𝑚 + 4 ) : 2 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 ( 𝑚 ) + 4 = 2 ↑ 𝑘 ( 2 𝑚 + 4 ) 2 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 ( 𝑚 ) + 4 = ( 2 ↑ 𝑘 ) 𝑛 ( 2 𝑚 + 4 ) 2 𝑔 𝑘 + 2 ( 𝑚 ) + 4 = 𝑔 𝑘 + 1 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 0 ) = ( 2 ↑ 𝑘 ) 2 𝑚 + 2 4 = ( 2 ↑ 𝑘 ) 2 𝑚 + 2 ( 2 ↑ 𝑘 2 ) = 2 ↑ 𝑘 + 1 ( 2 𝑚 + 4 ) QED Note: This depends upon the coincidence that 2 ↑ 𝑘 2 = 4 for all 𝑘 . If the parameters had been slightly different and we’d ended up with ( 2 ↑ 𝑘 ) 2 𝑚 + 2 5 above, I don’t think it would have been possible to get a closed form expression. Corollary: For all 𝑘 ≥ 0 , 𝑛 ≥ 0 : 2 𝑔 𝑘 𝑛 ( 0 ) + 4 = 2 ↑ 𝑘 ( 𝑛 + 2 ) From which it follows directly that: 𝜎 = 2 𝑔 15 3 ( 0 ) + 18 = ( 2 ↑ 15 5 ) + 14 Permutations 0 ∞ B> 0 ∞ → 86 𝐵 ( 7 , 3 , 0 ) 2 0 ∞ 0 ∞ C> 0 ∞ → 20 𝐵 ( 1 , 3 , 0 ) 2 0 ∞ Therefore, we can see that if we switch to: Starting in state B, the TM halts with a score of 𝜎 𝐵 = 2 𝑔 6 3 ( 0 ) + 9 = ( 2 ↑ 6 5 ) + 5 Starting in state C, the TM halts with a score of 𝜎 𝐶 = 2 𝑔 0 3 ( 0 ) + 3 = ( 2 ↑ 0 5 ) − 1 = 9 (which it does at step 72). This first permutation (start state B) is another top BB(3, 4) TM. Converted into TNF it is: 1RB3RB1LC2LA_2LA2RB1LB3RA_3LA1RZ1LC2RA0 1 2 3 A 1RB 3RB 1LC 2LA B 2LA 2RB 1LB 3RA C 3LA 1RZ 1LC 2RA Not Collatz One interesting thing about this TM is how surprisingly simple it is. For example, the fact that it does not have any Collatz-like rules (rules which act differently depending on the remainder of some value). Is this the end of the domination of Collatz-like TMs? It is far too early to know, but my guess is that there are Collatz-like Ackermann-level TMs waiting for us, but we are not seeing them right away because of selection bias. Perhaps this was the first Ackermann-level TM found because it is simple enough to be proven halting without having to implement modular arithmetic on Ackermann-level functions. Inductive Proof Validator This TM was the perfect test case for an “inductive proof” validator I am currently developing. The goal of this project is to develop a standardized certificate format for “inductive proofs” (an umbrella term for all the sort of forward-reasoning, rule-based analyses that are ubiquitous on this blog). The idea is that anyone with an “inductive decider” could write out their rules in this format and then this validator can check these proofs. The system is still very clunky and not ready for prime time, but I have been able (with a little elbow grease) to use it to prove the behavior of many TMs including this one.",

    "commentBody": "BB(3, 4) > Ack(14) (sligocki.com)167 points by LegionMammal978 5 hours agohidepastfavorite63 comments nickdrozd 2 hours agoIt is sometimes thought that extremely long-running Turing machine programs must be deeply complicated, or \"spaghetti code\". This new reigning champion program is a counterexample. All things considered, it is relatively simple. There are three states: A, B, C. (States are just like goto targets in C.) State B passes control to A and C, but states A and C don't \"know about\" each other; they only pass control back to B. This is a sort of modular construction, whereas in true spaghetti code each state would be able to pass to all the others. This program has some other interesting features. It never prints a blank (that is, whenever it scans a 0, it prints 1, 2, or 3). Additionally, every instruction changes either the state or the color -- there are no \"lazy instructions\" like B1 -> 1LB that just move position without changing anything else. reply LegionMammal978 1 hour agoparentThere is some debate in the bbchallenge project regarding the current long-running champions: do their properties reflect those of the actual longest-running machine of that size, or are their properties just the easiest to automatically search for and prove things about, as a kind of streetlamp effect? There's no way to know, until the entire search space has been ruled out, either definitely or heuristically. (Every size past BB(5, 2) contains chaotic, pseudorandom machines that are expected to run forever, but can't be proven to do so without big advances in number theory.) Though I suspect that no long-running machine can be utterly chaotic, at least when you look at the patterns it produces on the tape. To run for a long time, a machine must simulate some sort of higher-level rule: if it were dumping symbols on the tape at random, then it would very soon reach a halting configuration, a cyclical configuration, or some other simplified pattern. Still, one can have long-running machines that do simulate something chaotic on a higher level, spending an inordinate amount of time between each high-level step until it halts. reply nickdrozd 1 hour agorootparent> streetlamp effect I agree completely, all of these kinds of conjectures are shaped by what is detectable. If there are any \"dark matter\" programs out there, they by definition will be difficult to find. That said, I find it entirely plausible that the champions will win by exploiting complex and exotic mathematical facts, while the implementations of the math do not themselves need to be complex or exotic at the code level. More rambling thoughts about this: https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/09/25/spaghetti-code-conjec... reply LegionMammal978 1 hour agorootparentYeah, thankfully we're still in the range where halting machines are at least estimable in terms of inductive notations like the up-arrow. But as the machines gain more breathing room for working with variable-length data, we can start getting monsters like the TREE sequence. reply AlotOfReading 56 minutes agorootparentprevHandwaving here, but I think longest running machines can't follow a specific structure in general. Rough sketch of an argument: Let's construct a number from all intermediate states of the machine concatenated. The number of digits of this number should correspond to the runtime (sketchy). We only care about the halting machines, so it's finite. We know that it must be unique because if a smaller machine computes the same number, we could get a bigger number by simply running the smaller program and doing other nonsense. That means the biggest programs are komolgorov optimal, and the numbers themselves should be k-trivial and thus nearly but not quite computable. Since they're not computable, the programs themselves can't follow a structure to generate them (since that would be computable in turn for larger values). reply kevinventullo 1 hour agorootparentprevAt a high level, wouldn’t you expect Champions to be chaotic in the limit? As in, the halting problem tells us that any increasing sequence of Champions is not computable. reply tromp 1 hour agorootparentYes, for a busy beaver properly defined in information theoretic terms, like BBλ2 [1], one can prove that its champions must be incompressible up to some constant.

This is 3*4*log2(4*2*log2(4+1)) or about 64 bits of information. Meanwhile, in only 49 bits, BBλ(49) far exceeds Graham's number [1].

The official count of BB TMs as given in OEIS sequence A052200 ignores such symmetries. [1] https://oeis.org/A052200 reply nilstycho 53 minutes agorootparentprevAlso, is there any sense in restricting the universe of machines to those that include one and only one halting symbol? Machines with more or fewer than one halting symbol are possible, but they're less interesting, right? reply LegionMammal978 41 minutes agorootparentIf you mean multiple halting transitions, then it doesn't really help for BB purposes. If the machine does halt, then only one of the halting transitions will ever be taken, and the others will be 'dead code'. If you mean multiple halting states, then that is possible, and it can be used as a model of computation for, e.g., computable functions returning a single bit as output. But you still don't gain any additional running time before the machine halts. As for no halting transitions, the problem is choosing what point to measure the tape at. One thing you can do is to put a mark on one of the transitions, then see whether the machine only runs that transition a finite number of times, or if it keeps running it forever. This yields the \"Beeping Busy Beaver\" numbers [0], which are uncomputable even if you have an oracle for the halting problem. [0] https://www.sligocki.com/2021/03/06/beeping-busy-beaver/ reply nilstycho 3 minutes agorootparentWhat I mean is that instead of measuring the bits of a particular program BB(n,k), we could instead define a function BBWOHT(n,k) (\"Busy Beaver With One Halting Transition\"), and measure the bits of a particular BBWOHT(n,k) program, which would be fewer bits than in the equivalent BB(n,k) program. Perhaps this is semantic games, but I'm trying to get at the idea that while there may be 60 bits of information in the BB(3,4) program, there are fewer in the BBWOHT(3,4) program, because we can prima facie exclude a bunch of \"uninteresting\" BB(n,k) programs from consideration if we restrict ourselves to BBWOHT(n,k), in the same way that we can exclude a bunch of \"uninteresting\" BB(n,k) programs from consideration if we restrict ourselves to BB(n,k) programs that aren't symmetries of other BB(n,k) programs. mikewarot 1 hour agoprevThis all sounds like extreme Code Golf to me. Here's a tangent to explore: A BitGrid[1] (my personal hobby horse) only has 4 bits of state per cell, so a 4x4 grid of cells can't count more than 2^64, no matter what. Finding the highest it could count would be interesting. For small grids, the edge connections would dominate the outcome.

The \"colors\" (0, 1, 2, 3) are runtime data. At each state, the current color is read, and an instruction is executed (print some color, move left or right, goto some state) based on which color is there. Transliterated into C it looks like this: #include \"machine.h\" int main(void) { A: switch (SCAN) { case 0: WRITE(1); RIGHT; goto B; case 1: WRITE(3); LEFT; goto B; case 2: WRITE(1); RIGHT; goto H; case 3: WRITE(2); RIGHT; goto A; } B: switch (SCAN) { case 0: WRITE(2); LEFT; goto C; case 1: WRITE(3); RIGHT; goto B; case 2: WRITE(1); LEFT; goto C; case 3: WRITE(2); RIGHT; goto A; } C: switch (SCAN) { case 0: WRITE(3); RIGHT; goto B; case 1: WRITE(1); LEFT; goto B; case 2: WRITE(3); LEFT; goto C; case 3: WRITE(2); RIGHT; goto C; } H: HALT; } Question: are there any opportunities to rewrite this logic in a more \"structured\" style, or to make any other optimizations? reply sans-seraph 1 hour agorootparent> Question: are there any opportunities to rewrite this logic in a more \"structured\" style, or to make any other optimizations? Because A and C only jump to B it is possible to structure this using only loops and one boolean. Let us use Rust to demonstrate as it lacks GOTO: let mut a = true; loop { loop { if a { // state A match scan() { 0 => { write(1); right(); break } 1 => { write(3); left(); break } 2 => { write(1); right(); return } 3 => { write(2); right() } } } else { // state C match scan() { 0 => { write(3); right(); break } 1 => { write(1); left(); break } 2 => { write(3); left() } 3 => { write(2); right() } } } } a = loop { // state B match scan() { 0 => { write(2); left(); break false } 1 => { write(3); right() } 2 => { write(1); left(); break false } 3 => { write(2); right(); break true } } } } Of course it is possible to rewrite this as a single loop if you are willing to accept two bits of extra state rather than one. reply nickdrozd 44 minutes agorootparentWow!

So the first row & first column mean \"I have just read symbol 0 and am currently in state A\". The cell in the table describes which actions to perform. The first row & first column has \"1RB\" which means: \"replace the symbol on the tape with '1', shift 1 symbol to the right on the tape and switch to state 'B'\".

It is being clung to only because it is profitable for a small group of powerful academics and publishing houses, not because it has any actual merit in terms of the advancement of science. In fact, it's probably in no small measure responsible for contemporary replication crises. I'm as staunch an advocate of the scientific method as you will hope to find (I'm writing a book about it!) but IMHO traditional peer review is long past its sell-by date. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentBecause Discord is a proprietary glorified IRC SaaS; its contents are, by nature, ephemeral and under control of the vendor. I'd expect such links to rot very quickly. Collaborating on Discord is fine. Important results, including citations backing them, should really be published or at least replicated in more durable medium that's less susceptible to link rot, and easier to archive. Today, that's PDFs in paper repositories, or even regular blog posts. reply lisper 2 hours agorootparentI don't see any reason why the original publication venue has to end up being the canonical reference. That's not even true for traditional peer-reviewed papers. Have you ever seen an original physical copy of, say, Einstein's annus mirabilis papers? I haven't. I suspect that these are extremely rare and valuable collectors items and only trained archivists are even allowed to handle them. The right way to reference scientific publications is by URN [1], not URL. That makes the location irrelevant, as it should be.

I suspect that these are extremely rare and valuable collectors items and only trained archivists are even allowed to handle them. I'm not sure that they're collector's items, but they're probably not in that many university libraries. For example, the University of Michigan library has a physical copy in its special collection, but my university's considerably smaller library does not. But that's just because of age: this is a 119-year-old paper; were it a little younger, say, about 70 years, it would be in my university's holdings. I think that's a considerably different order of magnitude of its lifetime from a Discord link that I'd be absolutely astounded to see last a decade, and that in practice will probably last much less time than that. reply lisper 1 hour agorootparentWhat difference does it make if the original lasts a year or a century? The original is irrelevant except for historical purposes. What matters from a scientific point of view is that the results withstand scrutiny, and that they are reliably replicated and accessible. reply AlotOfReading 48 minutes agorootparentWe discover new approaches to replication all the time. Have you never come across foundational papers and arguments that everyone loved at the time, but made big methodological mistakes that led to the wrong conclusion? Or worse, found a source everyone references based on yet other secondary sources, only to look at the original context to discover that everyone's been misquoting it for decades? That happens regularly. reply LegionMammal978 28 minutes agorootparentIn this case, Ligocki's presentation of the proofs in the blog post is really more rigorous than anything that went on in the Discord server. There's not some golden Truth in there that's being imperfectly mediated; it's just about the attribution. You might have more of a point for results originating from programmatic searches, but that's why the programs are all published outside of Discord, so their output can be replicated. reply lisper 37 minutes agorootparentprevSure, but I don't see what that has to do with the choice of publication venue.

Etc. reply tsterin 8 minutes agorootparentI really like your point (I'm one of bbchallenge maintainers). I think that Discord is close to optimal for us in the short term, but bad for the reasons you and other have mentioned mid/long term. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, the responsibility for the replication crises is much trickier. It’s based on human motivations and poor science: 1. Outright fraud 2. Lack of independent verification of results before building up a body of work resulting in a bunch of garbage. Contributes to making #1 “easy”. 3. Financial pressures to publish or perish contributing to 1 & 2. If peer review didn’t exist you’d still something similar about producing “recognized” results. This is also probably why we haven’t done any major breakthroughs in particle physics which now has a much longer term thinking phase to come up with anything. The biggest problem with peer review is actually the establishment of an orthodoxy which discourages itself being upended by controlling the career success of anyone who dare challenge it - you have to support the orthodoxy to get career success and you fail to get recognition if your idea challenges the peer reviewers ideas and careers. That being said, such pressures existed before, but at least you could try to build your own following and it was competing orthodoxies instead of a single one winning out. reply lisper 1 hour agorootparent> Financial pressures to publish or perish But those only exist because of the current peer-review model. There is a huge non-linearity built in to the publication process that provides disproportionate rewards for conning a small number of people, fewer than half a dozen. That, combined with a presumption of trustworthiness, produces a perverse incentive for attempting such cons because they are very easy to pull off, much easier than actually doing good science. reply vlovich123 1 hour agorootparentThe rewards come from the grant model which I forgot to mention and also has similar problems to peer review. The stipulation to publish is a secondary effect. If peer review didn’t exist there would still be pressure to show that you somehow convinced the leading experts in the field. reply lisper 1 hour agorootparent> there would still be pressure to show that you somehow convinced the leading experts in the field And how do you tell who are the leading experts in the field? reply vlovich123 54 minutes agorootparentIt doesn’t matter. There’s plenty of ways. Tenure, those who get cited the most as contributing to other works, whoever manages to shmooze their way onto the grant review board, whoever has been doing “good” work in a space etc etc. If you think that peer review is the only way status is established, I’m afraid you’re failing to grok how humans work - we’re very status oriented and will come up with any mechanism to formalize and broadcast that status and academia and the scientific world is not immune from this. reply lisper 39 minutes agorootparent> Tenure And how do you think that gets decided? > those who get cited the most And how do you get cited without first getting published in a peer-reviewed publication? > whoever manages to shmooze their way onto the grant review board Do you think it's possible to do that without a publication record? > whoever has been doing “good” work in a space As decided by whom? The point is that the current system is based on a small cadre of people assessing each other's work on the assumption that they are all competent and trustworthy. The bigger the community, the easier it becomes to game the system, and the bigger the incentives to do so, and so the less reliable traditional peer review becomes as a predictor of scientific quality. To say nothing of the sheer horrible inefficiency. It takes months to do something that should take days. If anything was ever ripe for disruption, it's peer review. BTW, here is an example of what happens when someone actually sets out to game the system and is fairly good at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODgYbmmgOss reply vlovich123 8 minutes agorootparent> And how do you think that gets decided? Tenure precedes peer review afaik which I think pretty obviously negates this question - humans established tenure somehow so whatever that mechanism was. Peer review as a concept is quite old (17th century) and what these guys did on discord is peer review and collaboration. I’m assuming you’re just using shorthand to refer to journal peer review which is the more recent phenomenon. > And how do you get cited without first getting published in a peer-reviewed publication? Citations exist independently of peer review. Not sure why you think you can’t have one without the other. Journals are certainly not the only source cited. For example, math I believe doesn’t even generally use journals and yet citations are going strong there. > Do you think it's possible to do that without a publication record? Possible? Of course. Pick 10 random bureaucrats and have them pick admissions at random. Good? Well, now you seem to be arguing the pro publication position as a way of coming up with a better review board. But anyway, yes obviously there are better ways of establishing a grant review board by trying to populate it with some amount of “freethinkers”). Were agreed that the peer review system sucks for all sorts of reasons but we’re now very far afield from what I was trying to correct which is that the replication crises has many origins and isn’t just the fault of peer reviews. You’d have it even if journals and publish or perish weren’t a thing. LegionMammal978 3 hours agoparentprevFWIW, it's a public Discord server, you can find the invite link at the top-right of https://bbchallenge.org. Also, I'd consider these more as attributions than citations. All the major arguments supporting the results have been replicated in the blog post (in a more rigorous form), so it can stand on its own: the Discord links just provide historical context for those interested. reply j2kun 3 hours agoparentprevFinding bigger busy beaver numbers is not exactly foundational.

What I think you are doing here is to DEFINE \"foundational work\" as something that gets published in a journal. I don't mind if you use that definition, but if you do then the fact that all foundational work is published in journals is not insightful or informative, it is merely the definition. If, on the other hand, you intended for the statement to say something meaningful about how important scientific and mathematical work is communicated, then you need a different definition of \"foundational\". And you would have to look to that definition to decide whether this work was foundational, because if it was then it disproves your hypothesis: it would be a counter example that illustrates that some foundational work is shared in places other than journals. reply im3w1l 42 minutes agorootparentTo me, figuring out the halting behavior of small turing machines is similar in spirit going over all short logical propositions and trying to determine if they are true or not.

    "originBody": "Virtualization 59 It looks a lot like VMware just lost a 24,000-VM customer 59 Computershare CTO says he got a bill 15 times his previous quote Simon Sharwood Wed 22 May 2024 // 20:51 UTC Next Global stock-market share registry operator Computershare looks like it has just decided to bail from VMware rather than suffer Broadcom’s latest licensing regime and price hikes. Speaking during the closing keynote of Nutanix’s Next conference in Barcelona on Wednesday, Computershare's CTO Kevin O’Connor was asked how he feels Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware has played out. O’Connor replied that when he arrived 18 months ago he found the IT department using two hypervisors: Nutanix AHV, and another from what he described as coming from “a well-known competitor.\" Cough, VMware. The CTO felt two hypervisors was one too many and considered a consolidation, but the numbers didn’t stack up and no project was initiated. He later received a phone call he said took place after what he described as “the change.” And in that conversation he was quoted a future price for Computershare’s non-Nutanix hypervisor that represented an increase by a factor of between 10 and 15. CIO who dropped VMware 18 months ago now feeling thoroughly chuffed Veeam adds support for VMware alternative Proxmox to its backup software VMware giving away Workstation Pro, Fusion Pro free for personal use Microsoft gives Hyper-V ceilings a Herculean hike Migrating to AHV suddenly made a lot more sense and O’Connor has pulled the trigger. Over the next year, before that massively inflated bill falls due, Computershare will migrate 24,000 VMs to Nutanix. O’Connor said the project will pay for itself in “single digit months.” “Surprisingly, we've come out of this a lot stronger and leaner with cost base lower than it was before the acquisition,” he said without specifying which acquisition. “We're actually quite delighted it's spurred us to do what we should have done anyway.” Register comment The facts mentioned by O’Connor and the Nutanix emcee in the keynote give The Register a very high degree of confidence that Computershare is quitting VMware. If so, this smells like a little bit of trouble for Broadcom because earlier today, Steve McDowell, chief analyst at NAND research, told The Register that VMware by Broadcom is “laser focused on high-revenue, high-margin business” and has priced its wares “just below the pain threshold for customers they care about.” The Register has no insight into whether Broadcom cares about Computershare, but we do know it has concentrated its efforts on working with business that want to go all in on its Cloud Foundation stack - and the breadth of that bundle means customers are nearly always large entities. Computershare is certainly large: The Australian company had revenue of $3.3 billion last year, its 14,000-plus staff work across more than 20 countries, serving 40,000 clients and 75 million end-customers. All of which requires 24,000 VMs, which isn't the largest fleet around but also certainly isn't trivial. The Register imagines that calculating pain thresholds is an imprecise science. If Broadcom consistently gets it wrong then Computershare’s experience shows customers of its size and ilk will seek relief. ® PS: Anyone else find the Broadcom website for VMware stuff is now a bit sub-par?

According to the Cambridge dictionary, there are a couple of variants depending on your dialect: - \"to make something else seem better or more attractive when combining with it\" - e.g. \"Strawberries and cream complement each other perfectly.\" - \"to help make something or someone more complete or effective\" - e.g. \"She used photographs to complement the text of the news story. \" The only way I can make any sense of your words is to assume you're trying to argue that two competing but interchangeable services \"complement\" each other when used simultaneously because that might allow a customer to mitigate risk in a similar fashion to a multi-cloud setup. That's a pretty big jump to make from what you've actually said though and would really need further explanation for anyone to understand. reply mschuster91 5 hours agorootparentprev> Also pretty much guarantees flight of your former customer base to close compliments - who then have improved revenue to bring their products closer in alignment to yours. Classic VM hosting is a dead end anyway. Customers are shifting to the hyperscalers wherever they can, if only to reduce the headcount of their IT departments due to acounting wizardry making it worth it for the stonk markets even if the cloud costs more in the end. And then, there aren't that many alternatives to VMware, and none of them (bar OpenStack) as comprehensive. As long as Broadcom manages to squeeze enough out of the large customers who are vendor-locked too hard over the next 3-5 years, it'll be worth the money for them, and chances are the gamble pays off, with a small trail of extremely large customers paying for a decade until they can get their internal chaos sorted out to migrate off. reply alephnerd 8 hours agorootparentprevBroadcom makes $35B a year in revenue. VMWare made at most $13.4B. Even with severe churn, VMWare would make around $12.8-13B. VMWare is just a BU now, not a company, and the economics of managing \"just another product line\" is different from a company with a flagship product As I've mentioned before on HN, the math is different and it makes sense to up prices and only concentrate on F1000s at that size. > Pinning all your revenue on a much smaller customer base means losing one or two of them has a huge impact Large customers are sticky. You can't migrate your hypervisor or cloud provider overnight. These are multi-year projects. Also, it's better to target a smaller base of high paying customers instead of a large base of low paying customers because every sales motion and support ticket is an opportunity cost and a financial cost. reply yokaze 7 hours agorootparent> Large customers are sticky. You can't migrate your hypervisor or cloud provider overnight. These are multi-year projects. Yes, but that scale, everything is an multi-year effort. The contracts likely as well. That doesn't mean, it's not going to happen. And it's not like all has to happen in one go. So before you were all in VMware, and that vendor is practically promising to hike up the prices to make you bleed. What are you gonna do? I'd rather start early to have a migration path, even if it is just for negotiation purposes. And if it's someone who has the resources to that, it's large customers. reply alephnerd 7 hours agorootparentWhen you have a sticky existing customer who's about to churn, you end up discounting below the price of the migration, then slowly rise the cost again, then do the same thing again (this is easy because margins are 80% in our industry). All vendors do this - you can't escape it. This is why companies began leaving for the Cloud - sure it's upfront more expensive, but the negotiations are not as protracted. reply benterix 6 hours agorootparent> All vendors do this - you can't escape it.

I don't get your point here: if you mean the public cloud, it's the synonym of vendor lock-in now. reply alephnerd 6 hours agorootparentEverything is vendor lock-in. The difference is negotiations are not as protracted, the muscle to develop a multi-cloud strategy is fairly well built in our industry, AND cloud purchasing offers multiple different styles of billing (eg. subscription driven, multiyear, credit driven, etc) whereas with on-prem you have only a single type of billing model. reply markus_zhang 6 hours agorootparentprevSorry just to clarify, leave for the cloud or leave cloud? Looks like in this case it is indeed leave for the cloud (leave VMs) but I also heard a lot about leaving cloud for self hosting. reply alephnerd 6 hours agorootparentLeaving/left for the cloud. There is some scaling down of cloud resources for self hosting, but as a whole all CSPs have seen growth in users across all buckets. On-prem doesn't give you flexibility, and leaves you open to getting arm twisted by vendors. Similar stuff happens in cloud ofc, but it's easier to implement a multi-cloud strategy than a multi-hypervisor strategy. reply markus_zhang 6 hours agorootparentGotcha, thanks for the insight. reply mbesto 6 hours agorootparentprevAlso, where are ESXI customers at the enterprise level going to go? Do we really think they're going to magically switch over to HyperV (and get Win admins) or Proxmox (and have a lack of IBM-enterprise level support)? reply nunez 5 hours agorootparentprevVMware isn't just VMs. They are deep, deep, deep in the stack at some places. There isn't a realistic migration path away from VMware for the customers that Broadcom is interested in keeping. Or, put another way, the time it will take for those customers to move away from VMware (which they won't) will take Broadcom to make their money back on this acquisition a few times over. reply Spooky23 6 hours agorootparentprevDon’t attribute this stuff to strategy. The people running “the BU” are just counting on friction to hold on to revenue. They aren’t able to even meet the commitments they make and are disrespectful to customers in other ways. I think they overestimated their market power. I have 2 years left on my main ELA. I have budget to spend 5x to exit. My spend will go from 8 figures to under $1M. Personally, I resisted the visceral “fuck you” emotional response. But it’s one of the rare times when the quick take is correct. The reality is VMWare is dead and is too risky to keep in place. The smart move is not to play. reply op00to 3 hours agorootparentYou can fuck up A LOT and retain customers if you're honest and truly working in the customer's favor. The absolute second a customer picks up that you're in it to simply pick their pocket, there will be nothing left but a customer shaped hole in the wall. I have been in situations where we've completely fucked a customer's business causing all kinds of financial damage and customers have stayed because we committed to making things right. I've also been in situations where hubris assumed a sticky customer isn't going to unstick themselves, and of course the customer left. It's so much better business not to be an asshole. I really don't understand how people can't internalize this. reply OccamsMirror 5 hours agorootparentprevExactly this. Any smart CTO will be planning their exit. It’s pretty obvious that what made VMware great is now just a zombie. reply p_l 7 hours agorootparentprevLarge customers also can have resources to simultaneously negotiate you on price while starting 3 initiatives to \"remove vmware ASAP\". F1000 can have sticker price shocks and sensitivity too, especially if you happen to raise your prices soon after other events that might have made them look into cost savings... reply red-iron-pine 1 hour agorootparentI was an infrastructure architect at a F50, and I'm sure they'd have been quite sensitive to the changes.

The customer was already a Nutanix customer, so the hard work was already done. Basically, this customer was using BOTH Nutanix and VMWare internally (I am VERY surprised how the previous CFO did not get fired for something like that), and because they already had the Nutanix knowhow and licenses, migrated fully to it.

Spending 2x on hypervisors is dumb because now you need 2x the headcount on SMEs because you'll need both a Nutanix and VMware SME, as well as 2x the contract negotiations, and the money you are spending on both could have been better spend improving your product or hiring more people to sell your product.

A failed migration can become news, for example - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-15/ubs-says-... reply prmoustache 6 hours agorootparentIt only is because companies usually don't staff to be ready for large migrations.

If things are done right requires the same effort to patch and have downtime of all your systems than it is to migrate from one hypervisor to another. I've migrated tons of systems, sometimes p2v and v2v makes it simpler/faster but more often than not it is more useful and as fast to reinstall system then redeploy app (you can often use that time to migrate to major OS release) and it is dead easy to do a rollback if you encounter issues in migration, stop the new one, restart the old one. A company that is not staffed to migrate all its servers in less than 3 months is not staffed to have the most minimum level of IT security. reply icedchai 5 hours agorootparentThe reality is that in many organizations, nobody wants to update or reboot anything unless absolutely necessary. I once took a contract job at a company that wanted me to migrate and upgrade some Linux VMs running on a 5+ year old distro. This was a decent sized, established company, not a startup (1000's of employees, 100 million+ revenue) The existing VMs had not been updated or rebooted in years. Several had 1200+ day uptimes! These systems were accessible from the Internet and regularly used by customers for an important, highly specialized product. The only reason they were even bothering was they had failed some security scan and nobody there could even understand how to use SSH. The minimum level of IT security is apparently barely anything. reply alephnerd 6 hours agorootparentprev> Because migrations should happen all the time Hypervisor migrations? Complete DC migrations? If you are doing that every single quarter you are doing something VERY wrong (or you should migrate to the cloud). reply prmoustache 5 hours agorootparentYou don't have to do these migrations, but you should be able to do them because basic security maintenance of systems require regular patching, reboots, downtimes, etc. Setting up a new VM and deploy the apps/services takes minutes, not days.

(Also I hate hate HATE The Register's tone - so happy I'm not a PMM who has to wine and dine them at RSA or Re:Inforce. The moment RSA and these holdover 90s blog cartels like Register and DarkReading die, discourse in the space can become so much better. Practitioner lead conferences like Bsides and practitioner blogs are superior to these kinds of rags that are written in conjunction with vendors) reply hylaride 7 hours agoparentTo be fair, the tone is supposed to be that way. It was designed as a UK-tabloid style IT news source, which have informal and opinionated tones (I don't know if it was originally done in jest or not). The fact that it publishes in a low-brow, combative style in an industry that is (historically, anyways) mostly educated is part of the \"joke\", especially has most other tech press at the time it was created in the 1990s had conflict of interest relationships with tech companies (mostly relying on the same companies for advertising) - which is why the tagline is \"biting the hand that feeds IT\". It's easy to forget that most tech news sources were overwhelmingly uncritical to even bad tech. For those of us who had to actually deal with it, it was refreshing to know other people hated . For a good while in the 1990s (before it could stand on its own) it was a site written by people who actually worked with products from the tech companies (with their sales people) and could comment if they were going downhill or got screwed by pricing changes. Is it possibly outdated and tiring now? Sure (it stopped being a daily news source for me around 2010), but it helps to understand the history and why it is or was popular. reply alephnerd 7 hours agorootparentThe issue is these old school blogs aren't some random dudes eating ramen who love technology for the sake of technology anymore. They are now owned by press wire publishers and corporate conference owners, and as companies have increasingly moved away from both these options, the tone has become increasingly uneven. Look at how much RSA flamed Palo Alto Networks for deciding to quit RSA and how Register never uses snark in the articles it writes with CEOs, leadership, or companies who invite Register to their conferences. It's basically an attempt at extortion, not the truth. The practitioners who are technical don't write for these rags. And most of the Register's (and at all their parent companies publications) are non-technical journalists for whom this is a dayjob which they'll inevitably leave to become a Comm Marketer at a Vendor like the dozens I've worked with. > especially has most other tech press at the time it was created in the 1990s had conflict of interest relationships with tech companies So does The Register.

As I mentioned earlier, the register isn't on my radar anymore and obviously sold out. In your original post, you had a hate-on with their tone, but it was their tone that (originally) made them refreshing. The discourse without it would be have reporting on corporate release announcements and various reviews by people who don't use the products day-to-day in their actual job. Snarky tones about Larry Ellison needing yacht money or referencing whether a good or useful IBM product was worth having to deal with their aggressive sales people was the indications that the writers (again at one time) got or understood the industry.

I work in an IT department who relies on VMware and I certainly do not look forward to the prospect of updating all our tooling to work with multiple hypervisors. It works quite well as it is. And it certainly makes sense in the short term to spend the money on the product instead of on infrastructre. I just wonder about the long term in the context of how we do business. Because on the one hand you have management pushing topics like \"risk management\" where I have to take responsibility for the most trivial of things in day-to-day operations. And then there is the hypervisor issue where \"risk management\" goes out of the window and we happily rely on a single hypervisor that could (from one day to the next, more or less) upend all our business. reply alephnerd 6 hours agorootparentYep. It is a conundrum, and why a lot of my peers in F500s lead hybrid cloud or a multi-cloud migrations.

Finally, the new SKUs that Broadcom are pushing consolidate lots of products together that would have previously been purchased separately. If they were _only_ vSphere customers, the hike might have come from now needing to be NSX and vSAN customers against their will.

Going from those concerns, to now having substantial growth, can cause some pain points for a company reply sofixa 7 hours agorootparentprevThey still force you into a specific hardware organisation (hyperconverged, disks are on the compute nodes and storage is distributed) which doesn't make sense for everyone's workloads. Also, at least a few years ago(hope it's not still the case), a lot of their services were a bunch of open source poorly stitched together with bash, and their poor abstraction over it was leaking heavily. Their APIs were also very poor (I mean, VMware's are objectively complete shit, but at least they cover almost everything; Nutanix had major gaps in API coverage). Oh, and they're very expensive. reply grubbs 5 hours agorootparentI believe it's all Supermicro hardware.
