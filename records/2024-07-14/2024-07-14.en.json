Updates are very very minimal. I have their first jelly and it didn't even get the upgrade they promised. Other than that, it's not so bad. Swype-typing makes a small keyboard still useful. But the updates really are the achilles heel here. reply neltnerb 19 hours agoparentThey managed to lose all of their records of my purchase of one of their phones, directly from their store. I couldn't have sent it back for a warranty repair if I'd needed, they deleted my entire account. I even have email confirmations for the order from their system, it's kind of amazing. That said, I'd still buy another phone from them. This Atom L is years old and still has a three day battery life and no physical damage. The biggest issue with this brand in my experience is simply that it's not compatible with a bunch of phone networks for reasons beyond me. Verizon, for instance, will simply not work with my IMEI. That's a hard fail for a lot of people, and it prevents me from using it with most of those cheap piggyback carriers too. https://www.verizon.com/sales/nextgen/byod/enterDeviceIMEI.h... reply teruakohatu 15 hours agorootparent> They managed to lose all of their records of my purchase of one of their phones, directly from their store. That seems super convenient for them from a warranty perspective. reply cookiengineer 12 hours agoparentprevFor me personally, I learned to avoid every smartphone vendor that: 1) doesn't share the sources of their Android OEM images online 2) isn't compatible with LineageOS. 3) doesn't have replaceable batteries. If either of those apply, it's just a waste of money that can be avoided, regardless of build quality. In the case of the Jelly devices, they have a replaceable battery, but it's still just software waste. Usually I ended up buying devices that fit my description from ebay in used condition so it's also kinda better for the environment because I am breathing life into a device that would've been electronic waste otherwise. reply t0bia_s 11 hours agorootparent4) Is not bigger than 72mm W. What you ended up with? reply cookiengineer 7 hours agorootparentHonestly, some Sony XZ and Xiaomi Redmi devices were kinda nice in the past because even when they had a sealed battery they were still replaceable without super expensive heat plates. Ethically I'd probably recommend a Fairphone 2/3/3+ in used condition, though they are somewhat clumsy. Ironically it's somewhat more private because the fingerprinting sensor never works in all of these models :D In theory the Pixel 3+ devices would be amazing, but their resale value is just way too high for my cheap pockets. I set myself a limit of max 200 bucks for a used device, for both used laptops and smartphones and I never buy new hardware. I'd avoid MediaTek chipset devices, because they have a known RootKit that can be easily exploited. Their CPUs have an undocumented root mode, and there's some apps and SDKs available that got leaked a while back. My previous devices are now kind of ARM homeservers, because they either run ArchLinuxARM or PostmarketOS [1] on them, which is kinda nice and gives me a little satisfaction when I see that I can still use them for a nice tinkering purpose even without a battery inside. One phone even runs my local mesh router with external USB Wi-Fi adapters, off-the-grid and solar charged. The display is used for the Web UI to manage things, which is also kinda nice. It's basically a fullscreen WebKit in kiosk mode. [1] https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices reply t0bia_s 4 hours agorootparentSamsung Galaxy S line fits as well. reply exe34 9 hours agorootparentprev> isn't compatible with LineageOS I gave up on rugged phones for this, I got a pixel 5 and a rhinoshield, which has survived over a year so far, although I don't just throw it around like I could with the bv7000. that phone was the smartphone equivalent of an old Nokia 3310. reply cookiengineer 7 hours agorootparentSame here, same here. All Blackview and CAT models were insanely bad when it comes to their software, and I couldn't get them to run any self-built ROM and neither any GSI image so I gave up on my dream of an open rugged phone, too :( In the BV case I even tried using the MediaTek root-mode exploit, but didn't have success booting any compiled kernel because lots of drivers are messy in their firmware. reply ncruces 18 hours agoparentprevHonestly, I don't care about feature upgrades in a device like this, which, invariably, degrade experience, rather than improve it. I would much rather the industry moved to focus on security upgrades. Keep the device reasonably updated while it's on sale (either current or previous feature version max), then promise extended support for N years, where any critical security issues are patched, and that's all. I especially don't need the latest OS features, when 95% of the value is from apps that can be upgraded independently from the OS. reply nextaccountic 18 hours agorootparentI want open source OSes, giving the possibility of hobbyist communities that upgrade on their own current open source android roms will disable many features because they are proprietary. even roms that include proprietary code, like lineageos, will disable many features anyway because they can't make it work while updating the android version open source should be mandatory. let the rest up to the users (if there is a strong enough community) reply exe34 9 hours agorootparentprevor comply with the gpl and release the kernel sources so that it can be supported by lineageos et al. reply crossroadsguy 18 hours agoparentprevIn India that is the story with Motorola phones. They have started making decent hardware, as in competing with others, but they sometimes don't even respect updates for their flagship phones. And then, they are not alone in this. reply danieldk 12 hours agorootparentI took an Android detour late last year, early this year, just to see what the other side looks like. From the major vendors, only Google releases security updates like clockwork across all devices (similar to Apple). Many Samsung flagships have monthly updates (good), but rolling out the updates is a shit show. Like the S23 could get the update on the 11th of a month (~10 days after Google opened the monthly security bulletin), while the S22 would only get updated on something like the 28th. Also they usually missed Google's 5th of the month platform updates, causing some flagships to be vulnerable for a Bluetooth RCE for almost two months. Then some security updates are rolled out through the Google Play System updates (not Google Play or Google Play Services), however, the rollout regularly gets stuck on non-Google devices until someone at Google (?) fixes it. For instance when the Samsung S24 got out early this year, phones were stuck on the (I believe) July 2023 Play System. If you want regular updates on Android, your best bet is getting a Google Pixel. Unfortunately, Pixel has a long history of issues (like not being able to call emergency services). reply UncleSlacky 6 hours agorootparentprevLineageOS supports quite a few Motorolas, at least: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/#motorola reply goodburb 15 hours agoparentprevI have used my Android 9 flagship smartphone for 6 years without issues, but had all sorts of issues on iOS when I avoided updates, specifically with apps, missing or broken. Unlike iOS, most feature updates on Android are apps, not OS versions. iOS tends to be monolithic. You don't need to update to use the latest apps or security updates (which is also a patch), at least for a while. Android updates would make sense if the smartphone hardware advancments stop and the battery is easily replacable for a decade usage and more. e.g 8+ year old Android 7 devices are still supported and usable but slow. Many manufactures release OS updates without incrementing the version, they're usually low level fixes (mic, battery, speaker, sleep etc). reply torlok 10 hours agorootparentWhy would you avoid iOS updates? I only buy middle of the line used iPhones about every 3 years, and had no issues all the way into EOL. Apple keeps their phones updated for 6+ years and they always run smoothly. It's like the only great thing I can say about the company. Changing the battery yourself is easy too. reply goodburb 7 hours agorootparentWidget updates impacting task switcher and home screen with lag circa version 15/16 and battery drain on some models. While this is anecdotal, they don't always run smoothly at least statistically, and no software is always flawless... Arguably one could say that the major iOS versions don't have major differences while Android does. E.g 9 to 10 has major graphic stack overhaul and 12+ has major app API changes. iOS 12-13 is significant while 13-16 has less core changes and more UI/UX relatively etc. Android upgrades are technical and under the hood, usually hardware specific changes and API. Most people can't tell between Android 6 and 14 with vendor skin/theme. The point is you can keep an Android phone updated without changing the major version. You don't have to update the entire OS for the notes app like in iOS which I had to do because the Mac app refused to sync. You could also get major UI changes and new OS integrated features like quick share with app updates on the same Android version. Changing battery on any modern smartphone isn't easy and very risky for the average person. For the younger crowd, checkout smartphones before 2016, many had the ability to replace the battery under 10 seconds, though the point is that it's user serviceable. reply rchaud 3 hours agoparentprevMy Galaxy Fold is on Android 12, it's been bugging me to upgrade to Android 13, which I ignore. These days Android OS feature advances tend to be minimal. reply hagbard_c 20 hours agoparentprevThis is not as big a problem as you make it out to be due to the availability of alternative Android distributions. A quick search shows that LineageOS 20 already runs well on this device which means it should be possible to keep it up to date for a long time. I'm using a Samsung SIIIneo from 2014 with LineageOS 18.1 (Android 11) for which LineageOS 20 is available as well while Samsung dropped support at Android 4.4. Since I prefer the 'clean Android' experience over whatever vendor embellishments have been added I tend to switch to LineageOS as soon as I get a new (or \"new\") device anyway. I'm using LineageOS as an example but there are plenty of alternative AOSP-derived distributions for those who want something else. What I'd actually like to see is an updated Motorola Defy [1], a waterproof/shockproof device with a 3.7\" screen, a user-changeable battery, headphone jack, a good loud speaker, uSD card slot, etc. Just give it enough battery capacity to last for a week with mild use like the Defy+ offered, enough memory and storage to last for 10 years of Android development and make sure the bootloader can be unlocked by the user. That is one device I'd buy as a 'working' phone (i.e. a device which can withstand the rigours of farm life), what I use that Samsung SIIIneo for now. It already survived three falls from a 8.5m high barn roof while I was installing solar panels, my daughter's Defy+ survived going through a full wash/spin cycle when she left it in her trouser pocket. That is what I want from a phone, not some silly 'AI' gimmicks. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Defy reply nobodywasishere 20 hours agorootparentI used LineageOS on a number of devices for a number of years, and had to upgrade to a new device every year due to either performance, bugs, or official support being dropped. Can't tell you the number of various bugs I ran into that completely made it unusable, until the point I just started getting two of every device to be able to have a backup, and be able to do clean version updates. Being able to just get one device and use it for 5+ years is such a relief, and gives me a lot less to worry about day to day. Custom roms are best left to tinkerers who are okay with their device randomly breaking with no rhyme or reason, and spending hours either trying to fix it or reflash/restore to stock and set everything back up again. reply flawn 20 hours agorootparentYou got unlucky with your devices (having unfortunate hardware compatibility) or the ROM maintainers (being inexperienced or just not good). LOS is really great and rarely has any issues coming from the pure source of the OS. reply glenstein 19 hours agorootparentMy experience mirrors yours. I have it on two tablets and they're the most stable and lightweight in terms of a software experience of anything I've ever used. reply mitchell209 19 hours agorootparentprevI can’t even imagine what brands they’re buying where support is dropped that quickly. reply chasil 18 hours agorootparentprevI run Lineage on a Pixel 3a xl (no google), and a OnePlus 5 (mind the gapps). I have found both to be completely stable. My first Cyanogen phone was an HTC Incredible, and I don't remember any stability problems. reply andrepd 7 hours agorootparentSame. LineageOS is what allowed me to use devices I liked for as long as the hardware lasted, instead of being forced to buy the new crap. reply kelnos 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's only not a problem if you don't use banking apps, or anything else that cares about SafetyNet. I'm not willing to install something like Lineage and then figure out which brittle, unreliable hack will get SafetyNet to pass. Certainly not for my daily driver. Sure, some people don't care about things like Google Pay, but many many many of us do. I really miss the days of CyanogenMod, before SafetyNet was a thing, when I never worried about losing access to functionality I care about when installing a third-party Android OS. Even though the Pixel 8 is larger than I'd like, and the Pixel line has its share of problems, I'm thrilled that my new phone will get 7 years of security updates, and probably -- hopefully, if Google doesn't renege -- OS updates for those 7 years as well. That's incredibly important to me. reply mixermachine 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you use apps that require security (like payment apps) you might run into problems here. My company might need to exclude phones like this one soon because more and more CVEs are coming up. Alternative ROMs are often not the solution here because Play Integrity and Key Attestation no longer work. For general messaging and browsing this hardware likely work quite well. Btw I had the Motorola Defy and flashed it every month with a new ROM back in the days :D reply josephcsible 19 hours agorootparentI wouldn't use the phrase \"require security\" to describe such apps, since to fulfill what they actually require, you often end up being less secure. For example, most such apps will be fine with you running them on a phone with 20 critical CVEs from a year ago, but not on a phone that you unlocked the bootloader of to install a version of Android that fixes said CVEs. reply keyringlight 18 hours agorootparentThe challenge is trust, can you trust that an third party ROM hasn't been tampered with, and that third party maintaining the build for your device is often some guy on the internet you probably only know as a pseudonym. It might be the latest version, it might have some modifications that 'distro' of ROM applies to all their builds, some required per-device changes to make it work, but what degree of confidence is there that nothing else changed and the OS is lying to them? The same applies to most open source efforts, but I think it's understandable for institutions with consequences to what their apps do (like handling money and bank accounts) to opt out of potentially being undermined by the OS when they have the means. There's also elements of phones being general purpose computers now vs locked down appliances, GPL3 vs tivoization, and so on. reply josephcsible 14 hours agorootparentBut if you're going to worry that a custom ROM might be compromised, shouldn't you also be worried that you know that the stock ROM contains unfixed critical security vulnerabilities? Wouldn't any reasonable argument to forbid the former also forbid the latter? reply keyringlight 7 hours agorootparentI'd say when something like a bank is involved, they need something more substantial to point at for their insurance arrangements if/when something goes wrong. \"Our app allowed a $5000 transfer on the user's stock Samsung\" is easier to grasp the state of the system they're playing in than a user modified one. Also knowing what security risks are in play with N year old OS lets them decide if they want to allow the user to proceed or work around. Some applications are more aggressive in what version OS they need and that's a driver for upgrading phones, pushing the OEM to keep a phone in support for longer, or third party ROMs if this catch22 wasn't part of it. reply josephcsible 4 hours agorootparent> I'd say when something like a bank is involved, they need something more substantial to point at for their insurance arrangements if/when something goes wrong. \"Our app allowed a $5000 transfer on the user's stock Samsung\" is easier to grasp the state of the system they're playing in than a user modified one. Also knowing what security risks are in play with N year old OS lets them decide if they want to allow the user to proceed or work around. Some applications are more aggressive in what version OS they need I've seen plenty of apps need a minimum major version of Android, but never any that have needed a minimum security patch level. reply kjellsbells 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are cases every day where an employee of a company can demonstrate that A is at least as good as B, but trying to get permission to do B is impossible. There's simply no universe where an employee at a typical F500 company is going to be able to convince the IT team that they should permit custom code on phones even if the logic of the argument is sound. Even if they found the person, persuaded them, got them to persuade their management, in house legal teams, compliance teams etc., I seriously doubt whether the MDM solutions (eg InTune) would even have a checkbox to override the policy on one phone. To say nothing of the ongoing cost of tracking that one employee's specific setting. This also plays a bit into the argument of why integrating your personal device into the corpo ecosystem of your employer is not a decision to be taken lightly. reply josephcsible 4 hours agorootparent> There's simply no universe where an employee at a typical F500 company is going to be able to convince the IT team that they should permit custom code on phones even if the logic of the argument is sound. That's my point: I know that's how it is today, but the reasons for it being that way are illogical. reply hagbard_c 9 hours agorootparentprev> If you use apps that require security (like payment apps) you might run into problems here Works fine for me, two banking apps and two digital ID apps running on a Google-free device. About those CVEs, you do realise LineageOS offers OTA updates? Not everyone will install them but the same goes for vendor updates, probably even more so since those sometimes sneak in unwanted 'features'. If 'your company' 'might need to exclude [my devices]' I will just steer away from 'your company' just like I steered away from the many 'Windows only' companies. I survive, nay I thrive without having to use Windows and the same goes for Google et al. Nae kings, nae lairds, nae quinns, we are free men! reply Fnoord 17 hours agorootparentprevFormer SGS3 user here (non-neo, AFAIK). IIRC Samsung only managed one year of upgrades for it. The device had a, for that time, nice AMOLED screen and some flagship features. Custom ROM I ran on it (CM, probably, back in the days, or LOS) rather slow. And you get no baseband firmware/SoC upgrades anymore, since like 2015 or so. After this debacle I said never again Samsung smartphone. I gave mine away to Fairphone (they like to have smartphones of competitors to study design pros and cons). reply keyringlight 19 hours agorootparentprevI find it hard to universally recommend LineageOS because it can be a true 'your mileage may vary' situation depending what you use it for, which is fair enough for the fruits of a volunteer project. It's great if your aim is to get an old phone on a more recent release, but as they're not pretending that they're official firmware some apps won't work with that if they want the integrity check. Those apps can be broadly useful, and the whole reason you're updating in the first place. reply mrbluecoat 17 hours agorootparentSorry to hear that. Like others in this thread, LOS has been great for me (Essential phone model) reply skavi 20 hours agorootparentprevThat’s the first I’ve heard of the S III Neo. What an odd product. Came out 2 years after the original S III, in practically the same chassis, but with a few parts swapped.

However, for my own use, I want something in-between. A 4\" phone would be ideal. I'm still confused how there aren't any phones for people who still use a computer as their primary means of accessing the internet. Even for this one, the media review section makes it look like it's \"to distract oneself from social media\". As if a phone's primary purpose isn't to be a communication device for when you aren't near your computer. reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agoparentJust give us a commbadge then. Star Trek had it right all along. Commbadge (or flip communicator) is for talking. A PADD is for reading, writing, media consumption. A tricorder is for recording, remote sensing and remote operating needs. You always have at minimum the first one when in the go. When working, you usually have all on you. But then, at home and work you also have proper computer terminals available and then some. 10 years ago, I thought this was a quite obsolete vision, given how our smartphones are so multifunctional. These days I feel it was prescient, and that our phones are a bad idea, for human nature reasons. reply ghayes 14 hours agorootparentI tend to feel the Commbadge and communicator are tropes to make it easy to communicate to viewers.

I recently noticed my wife is increasingly often exchanging voice messages on Messenger instead of text messages, with increasing number of her friends. I queried about this several times, she says they all find it more convenient. It sounds unbelievable to my text-first sensibilities, but apparently it is. reply throwaway55110 12 hours agorootparentThis is very prevalent in the expat community where I have many friends. I hate it. At least the current AI developments made it possible for messenger apps to transcribe the messages to text (and back, though I haven't seen that feature yet) - we both get what's best for us. And same with voice calls and voicemail - I mostly don't accept calls and let them all go to voicemail. iPhone transcribes what they're saying in real time and I can decide to pick up. I'm really looking forward to an AI-first total overhaul of communication UX. reply vladvasiliu 11 hours agorootparent> iPhone transcribes what they're saying in real time and I can decide to pick up.

The whole point of owning it is that I have a very light-duty relationship with the phone: music/podcast, maps, some food delivery and ride share, and some messaging when I'm not at my laptop. I don't read stuff on it, let alone browse the web or doomscroll social media. So when I'm at home it can easily last a couple days. If I'm traveling by air, or other rare occasions where my phone gets heavy use, I have a slap-pack battery to stretch it out. I'm more likely to resort to that if I'm traveling and I forget to charge it: it's obviously not as much battery as a bigger phone, but for 99% of days, it's more than fine. It serves my purposes, and fits in more pockets than the big bricks do. I wish Apple would learn to count as low as several million, and go back to accommodating the smolphone niche, but their current policy seems to be that if a product doesn't sell enough units to supply one to every resident of a mid-sized European country, it isn't worth manufacturing.

Apple discontinued the iPhone mini because they weren't selling. The iPhone SE's popularity is driven by price, not the demand for a smaller phone. The iPhone SE is 5% taller and wider than an iPhone mini. People didn't buy the iPhone mini at $100 cheaper than an iPhone. If they were going to settle for a smaller phone, they wanted half-off. It allows Apple to be in the $400 market by putting out a device that won't compete with the regular iPhone. If Apple offers an iPhone SE sized device at $700, people don't want it. iPhone SE buyers mostly want a larger phone - they just don't want to pay for it. I love the iPhone mini, but people didn't want a small phone. They wanted a cheaper phone. I'd love it if this weren't the case. I do want a 5\" phone, but when Apple put out a 5\" phone, people wouldn't buy it. They'll only buy it if you price it at half-off. reply SpecialistK 7 hours agorootparentThere certainly was some market for a small phone, although how much is beyond my current knowledge. It's definitely a niche market segment. I think Apple's misstep was to make it a small version of the yearly models rather than a nicer version of the SE. The SE is on a 2-3 year cadence rather than yearly, and the hardware in the 2022 SE is very similar to the 13 mini. So I think the angle should have been to market the SE in 2 flavors: the current \"Touch ID\" model with hella bezels for US$429, and a \"Face ID\" model (the \"mini\") for US$499 or $529. It could keep just the single camera, notch instead of \"Dynamic Island,\" no MagSafe, worse screen and glass, etc. This wouldn't eat into the market for the more expensive models while still delivering enough performance for most people. Sure it wouldn't please the \"literal flagship, but smol\" crowd, but would have reduced engineering and make inventory easier. reply whyoh 11 hours agorootparentprev>Apple discontinued the iPhone mini because they weren't selling. I've read somewhere that they sold several millions of them in the US alone. Is that not enough to make a profit?

People who want a smaller phone probably have a computer at home. reply rtpg 13 hours agorootparentprevReading this post... I think that probably the mini's failures are due to it being so much more than the SE, but people wanting smaller screens are also people \"OK\" with less tech in the phone as well.

I don't want to deal with that. I would be happy to pay a premium if an OEM supports it. I neither have time nor patience/passion (more of this one) to tinker around anymore.

I was amazed by the vast range of devices in this category (at the time). After a few Google searches trying to understand why there was demand for such small phones, one article suggested that these phones are perfect for getting smuggled in prisons \"you know how\". Don't know if this is true, but it sounds plausible and the vast range of devices could be explained by this. They were tinier than the smartphone in this article, though. reply langcss 17 hours agoparentThere was a time around 2004ish where fashion was smaller the phone the richer you appear.

The Titan Pocket is a nice phone, a bit too big and too heavy for me, but like most of the Unihertz offering the major pain point is that the stock firmware is old and not to be trusted, and the community-driven LineageOS alternatives are flimsy and incomplete. This is also due to Unihertz and Mediatek not doing their part and releasing the relevant source code or documentation for specific drivers/services.

That aside, two things I would really like in a phone like this are a better camera, and the ability to plug in the phone to a bigger screen (some apps have an equivalent web-app you can use on a laptop, but there were enough that didn't have that that I had to stuff around on them with the phone). Also it is quite thick, but this didn't bother me very much. reply laurex 18 hours agoprevI still use an iPhone SE (original 2016 version), probably the most beautiful phone ever and quite functional, though this year it finally stopped being supported by a lot of apps due to its iOS. Surprisingly, most apps work just fine until they are just removed from availability. (I'm not gaming on it or anything!) It is the perfect size and with no notifications enabled, is dang near ideal as long as you don't need great photos (but if Apple ever returned the form factor which will obviously never happen, I am sure a decent camera is viable). That said, I really can't believe we are still stuck with these devices, which are mostly anti-social and too tempting to distraction.

Screenshots: UTM SE Apple has approved UTM SE, an app for emulating a computer to run classic software and games, weeks after the company rejected it and barred it from being notarized for third-party app stores in the European Union. The app is now available for free for iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. After Apple rejected the app in June, the developer said it wasn’t going to keep trying because the app was “a subpar experience.” Today, UTM thanked the AltStore team for helping it and credited another developer “whose QEMU TCTI implementation was pivotal for this JIT-less build.” UTM SE doesn’t include any virtual machines, but does help you find them. Screenshot: UTM SE As with other emulators on the App Store, you can’t do much with UTM SE out of the box. It doesn’t come with any operating systems, though the app does link to UTM’s site, which has guides for Windows XP through Windows 11 emulation, as well as downloads of pre-built virtual Linux machines. Mac OS 9.2.1 and DOS are listed in one screenshot from the UTM SE App Store page. Here’s the App Store description for UTM SE: UTM SE is a PC emulator that allows you to run classic software and old-school games. * Supports both VGA mode for graphics and terminal mode for text-only operating systems * Emulates x86, PPC, and RISC-V architectures * Run pre-built machines or create your own configuration from scratch * Built from QEMU, a powerful and widely used emulator Most Popular Most Popular Here’s how much Valve pays its staff — and how few people it employs Shooting conspiracies trend on X as Musk endorses Trump After initially rejecting it, Apple has approved the first PC emulator for iOS The making of Eno, the first generative feature film A supercheap Android phone with looks to spare Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Leaked schematics make a huge difference here. I've watched these videos — and the people you're referencing doing this are rarely using any kind of schematics at all to repair modern digital-logic boards. And not for lack of accessibility! Modern logic-board designs consist of a few proprietary ICs, plus generic labelled support components (e.g. VRM caps, surface-mount resistors and diodes, etc.) You can repair these boards, but these repairs fall into three categories: 1. bad solder joints or broken traces — which mostly just requires looking at the board carefully to notice these. 2. bad generic support components — which in theory you can determine the need for by testing with various multimeter modes across the individual component's legs; but more often you just notice that what the component is in line with isn't working, and \"swap out to see if that fixes it.\" And which where such a swap-out can be done by just looking the part to figure out what it identifies itself as; then de-soldering it and soldering on a replacement. 3. bad proprietary ICs — which you determine by tapping the signal lines leading from/to the IC on an oscilloscope; and which you \"fix\" by buying other for-parts copies of the board, de-soldering those ICs off of the sacrificial parts boards, and soldering them onto the \"almost good\" board. In none of these cases would referencing a schematic help! They're all effectively \"context free\" repairs — see, probe, think, do. (A schematic can in theory help you to find test points to differentially diagnose 1 vs 2 vs 3 in the case where a board is failing mysteriously... but once you have some experience in board repair, you can get 80% of the same information by just staring at the board for a minute.) --- Of course, if you're repairing a power supply, or an audio receiver, or some still-half-analogue electronic appliance from the 1970s — then yeah, schematics help. But these types of systems do still come with those schematics! (You just need to buy the thing directly. You aren't getting a schematic for an \"embedded\" PSU with a computer; but you do get the schematic if you buy that same PSU at retail at a Shenzhen parts-mall. And you get forwarded that same schematic [and more] if you make an industrial order of 10000 of them, too.) reply Gud 3 hours agorootparentprevThen how come Apple and so on are actively working against the DYI community? reply seanthemon 9 hours agorootparentprevAccessibility goes in, shiny new toy comes out Humans go ooo, accessibility never comes back again.. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 8 hours agorootparentI implore you to not trivialise and belittle “humans” for not always prioritising what you personally would like them to.

Explaining and justifying those reasons would be better. I choose hackability and upgradeability and less vendor lockin because I myself value those things, but I see that as a personal preference and not something I want or need to impose on the industry as a whole. Benefits to the environment and reducing waste are clearly valuable but it's not obvious to me without seeing data that such benefits would be high—many people tend to upgrade phones long before batteries need replacing anyway, so I would need to see data that demonstrates that a substantial number of things would be saved from the landfill by virtue of higher reparability. reply skhunted 3 hours agorootparentprevWaste and environment are the only reasons you gave that speak to the preference being bad in any sort of objective sense. The status quo ante iPhones was lack of repairability in cheap, small devices. The devices cost little and there was little economic friction to just getting another one. I don’t know for sure but I imagine the average length of use for Nokia devices was less than that of iPhones.

I can also assure you that losing the hardware acceleration offered by Apple's extensions and the general performance boost JIT/AOT offer is much more than 80%. But, sure. For argument's sake, let's accept your (incorrect) premise. Taking a 1ghz potential emulated target processor down to 200mhz is a fairly drastic drop.

And I actually do have evidence for my conspiracy theory: iDOS 2. Apple was perfectly fine with it up until someone in tech media posted a guide on how to run ancient versions of Windows on it, then they pulled the app. Furthermore, \"fingers shall not touch mouse apps\" was a Jobs decree. It's specifically the reason why Apple got into touch UI. Jobs designed the iPad out of spite due to a friend of his who was on the Windows tablet team around the turn of the millennium. Jobs was so angry that they were just putting Windows on a tablet - and handing people styluses to work around the small touch targets on XP - that he made Apple design a tablet computer demo around finger-only UI. That was then grafted onto the Purple project (which at that point was a clickwheel iPod with a phone modem in it) and we got the iPhone. So my suspicion is that Apple has an internal \"things which make Jobs spin in his grave\" list that they would never allow, come hell, high water, or the European Union's antitrust regulators. reply jamesgeck0 9 hours agorootparentprev> They just don’t want to grant a third party JIT permission because of security concerns The initial rejected UTM submission had no JIT compilation. reply derefr 3 hours agoparentprevYou can already get a desktop on iPadOS, though.

The source code says: \"TCTI (TCG with threaded-dispatch bytecode interpreter, experimental and slow; but faster than TCI)\"[3] So, apparently, it's some kind of optimized interpreter. Exactly what it means by \"threaded-dispatch\" is unclear, there's some surprisingly tricky looking things going on[4]. Does threaded refer to OS threading, or does it maybe mean that it's doing something a bit more like a cached interpreter? I wonder if it's even more clever than that.

Opinions Most Recent SCOTUS Cases Notes on Use ← S.D.Ohio: Indicia of residency can be subject to search and seizure under a SW CA4: No REP in one’s Google location data Posted on July 13, 2024 by Hall There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in one’s Google location data. It’s willingly shared with Google. United States v. Chatrie, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 16692 (4th Cir. July 9, 2024) (2-1): Location History is turned off by default, so a user must take several affirmative steps before Google begins tracking and storing his Location History data. First, he must enable location sharing on his mobile device. Second, he must opt in to the Location History setting on his Google account, either through an internet browser, a Google application (such as Google Maps), or his device settings (for Android devices). Before he can activate the setting, however, Google always presents him language that explains the basics of the service. Third, he must enable the “Location Reporting” feature on his mobile device. And fourth, he must sign in to his Google account on that device. Only when a user follows these steps will Google begin tracking and storing his Location History data. Roughly one-third of active Google users have enabled Location History. Even after a user opts in, he maintains some control over his location data. He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained. So, for instance, he could decide he only wants to keep data for certain dates and to delete the rest. Or he could decide to delete everything. Google also allows him to pause (i.e., disable) the collection of future Location History data. Whatever his choice, Google will honor it. From start to finish, then, the user controls how much Google tracks and stores his Location History data. Once a user enables Location History, Google constantly monitors his location through GPS, even when he isn’t using his phone. And if he has an Android phone, he can turn on another setting—”Google Location Accuracy”—that enables Google to determine his location using more inputs than just GPS, such as Wi-Fi access points and mobile networks. As a result, Location History can be more precise than other location-tracking mechanisms, including cell-site location information. But whether Google Location Accuracy is activated or not, Location History’s power should not be exaggerated. In the end, it is only an estimate of a device’s location. So when Google records a set of location coordinates, it includes a value (measured in meters) called a “confidence interval,” which represents Google’s confidence in the accuracy of the estimate. Google represents that for any given location point, there is a 68% chance that a user is somewhere within the confidence interval. Google stores all Location History data in a repository called the “Sensorvault.” The Sensorvault assigns each device a unique identification number and maintains all Location History data associated with that device. Google then uses this data to build aggregate models to assist applications like Google Maps. In 2016, Google began receiving “geofence warrants” from law enforcement seeking to access location information. A geofence warrant requires Google to produce Location History data for all users who were within a geographic area (called a geofence) during a particular time period. Since 2016, geofence requests have skyrocketed in number: Google claims it saw a 1,500% increase in requests from 2017 to 2018 and a 500% increase from 2018 to 2019. Concerned with the potential threat to user privacy, Google consulted internal counsel and law enforcement agencies in 2018 and developed its own three-step procedure for responding to geofence requests. Since then, Google has objected to any geofence request that disregards this procedure. Google’s procedure works as follows: At Step One, law enforcement obtains a warrant that compels Google to disclose an anonymous list of users whose Location History shows they were within the geofence during a specified timeframe. But Google does not keep any lists like this on-hand. So it must first comb through its entire Location History repository to identify users who were present in the geofence. Google then gives law enforcement a list that includes for each user an anonymized device number, the latitude and longitude coordinates and timestamp of each location point, a confidence interval, and the source of the stored Location History (such as GPS or Wi-Fi). Before disclosing this information, Google reviews the request and objects if Google deems it overly broad. At Step Two, law enforcement reviews the information it receives from Google. If it determines that it needs more, then law enforcement can ask Google to produce additional location coordinates. This time, the original geographical and temporal limits no longer apply; for any user identified at Step One, law enforcement can request information about his movements inside and outside the geofence over a broader period. Yet Google generally requires law enforcement to narrow its request for this more expansive location data to only a subset of the users pinpointed in Step One. Finally, at Step Three, law enforcement determines which individuals are relevant to the investigation and then compels Google to provide their account-identifying information (usually their names and email addresses). Here, too, Google typically requires law enforcement to taper its request from the previous step, so law enforcement can’t merely request the identity of every user identified in Step Two. Bloomberg: Geofence Warrant Decision Exposes Hole in Fourth Amendment Law by Cassandre Coyer & Tonya Riley (“A split appeals court opinion clearing the government’s acquisition of users’ mobile-device location data from Google of constitutional scrutiny will likely spark more friction between emerging technologies and the scope of law enforcement searches, attorneys warned. [¶] The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s ruling in US v. Chatrie concluded, over a dissent, that the use of such geofencing doesn’t constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.”) This entry was posted in GPS / Tracking Data, Reasonable expectation of privacy.

This is beyond asinine and I don't know how they can say they gave me any informed consent on the change - the whole thing is bizarre. I took a screenshot, and left it running for a few hours while I stewed over it luckily. Then went and confirmed the \"backup\" of my timeline afterwards just to be sure. But who knows if this \"feature\" even works as before, even though it has my backups. Side note. The solution to this is not to move my data to \"the device\" and off their servers.

Still, you can do two things to maximize your privacy: 1. In https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols, disable all activity history – everything should show \"off\". 2. In iOS, turn off background permission to all Google apps. (You can do this for most apps without loss in functionality). Then, turn off location permission all apps. For maps, give it location permission to \"allow while using\" only. This is the least intrusive you can get to. Beyond this, you can also use different google account for different google apps to minimize data mingling. Further beyond that, you can just stop using google apps. reply jffry 5 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it's similar to the Android app. If so: 1. Open Google Maps 2.

Now, in your mind, go back to that time period, and lets say there are elections coming up in your country. Are you there yet? OK. Now, the manifesto of the candidacies in the upcoming elections is proposing that the location history data of every citizen in your country should be stored in a database, just in case law enforcement needs to know the exact location of any individual at any time to be able to do their investigations. Suppose that their plan to implement it is technologically feasible and requires no additional effort from the citizens.

My bank knows everywhere I go (if I spend money). The main mobile phone companies know everywhere I go (in real time, and who with [if they have a phone]). Shops and supermarkets track you around the building by Bluetooth, et cetera. So, what's the problem if the police get access to this data to solve heinous crimes. I'm not talking the RIP Act (UK, regulatory investigation powers) - which lets a ridiculously broad swathe of people see, eg your internet history - but major crimes ... why not?

There’s a balance between individuals rights to privacy and what makes law enforcement easier.

You might be fine with the laws that are enforced with it today, but you might not be with what it’s used for in the future. reply dmantis 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause law enforcement must be costly and non-automated to avoid the unbalanced power distribution between an individual and the gov, which only serves the individual and not rules them.

But I don’t think it’s an inherent tradeoff? In theory, anyway, the police work for us. They’re spending taxpayer money. It’s expensive. If there’s a way of making them more efficient then we should want them to use it. Maybe there are ways? This doesn’t mean skimping on necessary safeguards, but that doesn’t mean we need to put up unnecessary obstacles about knowing where to look. We should still want them to win at finding criminals and we don’t want “game balance” because it’s not a game. Catching the bad guys and not prosecuting the wrong people both involve having more accurate information. Bad information means more mistakes. It doesn’t mean just trusting them.

Let's be honest though, it's a hypothetical boogeyman. The real problem is that we all secretly know that we don't live in a rainbow world where we all agree on what is \"right\".

No, it just shows that you can repress even with less ability to track people (a fact nobody doubted. The Romans could repress people too and they didn't have mass surveillance). It, however, absolutely doesn't refute the point that with more ability to track people you can repress more, more effectively, and in novel ways. >Elect trustworthy people first. Popular pressure (and even ocassional popular revolt), separation of powers, and various established checks and balances are there precisely so you don't have to depend on electing trustworthy people.

What's changed in the meantime, aside from the richness and granularity of location data, is awareness of the potential for the abuse of it all, supported by well-publicized incidents.

Is this some kind of trick question? Your location can be used for ad targeting in other contexts. For example if you granted location permission to google.com in your browser, Google gets your location at the time you do a query and uses it both to provide relevant results and to target ads. And if you have search history on, I assume that location snapshot would be saved along with the query in search history, which Google can see.

What happened to Google on privacy could easily happen to any company- people complained about the total amount of data Google had, the gut response of the devs was “oh, you can trust us, we’re not using it for anything nefarious, just features/debugging” And then Apple took that and used it as a marketing opportunity.

I completely agree, but I think we need to push society away from requiring for profit products into our life, or at least recognize that they have an association cost to the user. What is the reasonable expectation of a business to profit off a product that we’ve deemed “required”? Who would make or support a product they can’t profit on? In the EU, they required Facebook to offer a no-tracking version of the product, which meta replied by making a paid tier. Then they required Facebook to not charge for their no-tracking version. So why should facebook stay in the EU if it can’t profit from providing a service? While no one will shed a tear over Meta’s business, it is a massive way for people to connect with each other. Google Maps could theoretically suffer the same fate - and free access to maps seems like a public good. YouTube is another example that can be for the public good due to its educational content. The list of products that are “free” and probably good for society is huge now thanks to effective online advertising.

We kind of urgently need new models for certain things that start as for-profit and then fade towards more publicly owned utilities. This is the essence of the idea behind things like patents and copyright, and when we're talking about a service where the creators have been wildly successful the basic issues are mostly the same. Fair compensation, but not ownership in perpetuity. The thing about maps and similar is, it's not an idea to be protected because the idea is the easy part but the data is hard. Since google did some part of the actual mapping, they certainly deserve credit, but of course the whole thing could not exist if GPS wasn't essentially available as a public utility. Maybe if they want to be stingy with the map data forever, they should pay license fees for the GPS technology, since that's a piece of infrastructure they outsource to the public? Or for our individual data, since it's required to build their models? Regardless of your stance on political/economic ideology, surely individuals can agree that it's not sustainable for society to be beholden to for-profit corporations forever for things like maps, the ability to use a flashlight or a toaster, the ability to open doors on houses or cars you own, or access to water/air. Maintenance is a real issue for most technology even after it's figured out, so probably the corporations should be forced towards spinning off actually separated co-ops/nonprofits/utilities in the fullness of time. So basically wild profits and all the awful antisocial and anti-competitive behaviour you can get away with, but having some explicit expiration date for service-monopoly as well as idea-monopoly.

Do people really think Google isn't tracking location data without this setting enabled? How would anyone (save for a whistleblower) know? Location history seems like the data Google lets you collect/see for yourself, and not the totality of location data (which includes data collected from nearby wifi networks, nearby cellphones, and other bluetooth devices) that google collects. > Even after a user opts in, he maintains some control over his location data. He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained. This is pretty misleading. You can see the location information your device sent to google, but you can't see or delete the assumptions that google has made about you based on that data. A list of GPS coordinates showing where you frequently go on Saturday nights isn't what people are concerned about Google having. The fact that those GPS coordinates show that you spend hours at, for example, a gay bar is more of an issue. It doesn't matter if you delete the list of GPS coordinates from your google account because what you can't delete is the \"This user is gay and often goes to gay bars on Saturdays\" flag that google put there the instant they got that data. No matter what you delete that data stays with Google along with the \"here's how long this user stays at the gay bar, when they usually leave, where they go afterwards, and who they are with when they do\" flags. I think what happened to this guy (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike...) is a good indication that the entire system and the way it's being used by police is flawed and dangerous. Even worse, the situation with google is just the tip of the iceberg because it's not just our phones that are tracking us. It's also our cell phone companies, the random cameras and license plate/toll transponder readers we pass by, our \"smart\" cars, etc. There's so much tracking going on that the typically American has zero control over at all, but which police (and others) could tap into. We really need more protections against this. reply gruez 15 hours agoparent>Do people really think Google isn't tracking location data without this setting enabled?

It'd be nice if we had strong whistleblower protections as well. Maybe a massive bounty to anyone who can prove to regulators that their company is violating customer's privacy would help. > Is there any evidence this actually happens? Well, yeah. That's literally Google's entire business model. They collect as much data as they can about you, so that advertisers can request their ads to be show to certain segments of the population. That's what targeted advertising is. Nobody is sending Google updates on their lives, google just makes a bunch of guesses and inferences using the massive amounts of data they collect about you, and as long as they are correct most of the time it pays off for advertisers. Google isn't alone in that either. Many many companies do it, as well as data brokers. You can be extremely specific in who you target. See for example: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-data-brokers-selling-your-p... Among the worst are lists of people with mental illness, dementia, poor education/literacy, low intelligence, etc. I doubt Google lets you target people based on predatory lists like that, but they might keep them for their own uses. They have collected the test scores and grades of a lot of children through schools that force students to create google accounts and use chromebooks. It'd be pretty easy for them to sort people into buckets like \"smart\" or \"dumb\". Lots of companies privacy polices state specifically that they collect this kind of data. For example, here a company that collects \"Personal Information used to create a profile about you, which may include your preferences, reading or writing levels, abilities, aptitudes, and other data or analytics provided about you or your account by our third-party partners or data aggregators. \" (https://www.captivoice.com/capti-site/public/entry/privacy_p...) reply Hnrobert42 15 hours agoparentprevI completely distrust Google.

Google has been terrible at avoiding leaks, and everyone working there seems to be jaded after the layoffs rocked the company. Regarding the “gay bar” anecdotes - I think there are some weak protections around “derivative data” in some jurisdictions but this is likely a gap in laws.

The most hated corporations in the US are all insanely rich and are at zero risk of going out of business even though most people hate them. After a certain point, corporations have basically nothing to fear from bad press. Google specifically has been found guilty of violating the law and people's privacy on numerous occasions already, including misleading users into thinking they had turned off location tracking in their account settings even though Google was still collecting that information.

I suppose that they could if there was a lie_to_public_about_data_collection() function in Android's source code or a massive store of location data that shouldn't exist just sitting unencrypted on our devices and being transmitted to google unencrypted, but other situations would be much less clear. For example, when you open Google maps, you'd fully expect that your location would be sent to google. You'd also expect that google wouldn't keep that information tied to your account if you'd opted out of that tracking in your account settings. If google were keeping a copy of that location data on an internal server somewhere, associated with your dossier, but not made visible to users (or even most google employees) what proof would you expect to see posted to HN that we could verify for ourselves? Screenshots of the database/internal tool/documentation might be good, but screenshots can be faked and since we don't have access to the database, or the server deep inside google that hosts it, or their internal documentation we'd be unable to say for sure if it the screenshots were real.

You guarantee me the same return as the index within that time frame. If you beat the index, you keep 90% of returns ABOVE the index (and I get 10%). We both win, and you win big. If you don't beat the index (within the time frame), you make up the difference (so I get the return to the index). reply ProjectArcturis 3 hours agoparentThe point of actively managed funds is not so much to \"beat the market\", it's to provide diversified returns via strategies that are uncorrelated with the market. On average, the S&P500 has returned about 7% annually. If I had a strategy that returned 5% on average but was totally uncorrelated with the S&P, then you'd get the best overall long-term returns (maximize the geometric average of annual returns) by investing in a combination of my strategy and the S&P. reply Maxatar 1 hour agorootparentThis is a kind of revisionism that mostly took off after Warren Buffet won his bet that hedge funds would not outperform the market over a 10 year time period. The original goal and selling point of hedge funds was to produce consistent results regardless of the market's performance by using long and short positions to provide absolute returns in any market environment. With that said, even if you accept the revisionism, it's untrue that actively managed funds are uncorrelated with the market. What is true is that selection bias makes it seem like they are since when interest rates rise and markets go through a down swing, the majority (and yes I mean more than 50%) of hedge funds go out of business. As such the only hedge funds that remain are the ones that happened to weather the storm so to speak. reply bityard 1 hour agorootparentprevI want to agree with you, except that almost all of the salescritters for these products promote them as \"beating the market.\" They _have_ to sell them this way because if their customers had any idea what the whole-market returns actually were, they wouldn't pay extra for the privilege of a far riskier (and lower-performing, on average) investment.

No point being the one taking the risk - if the professionals don't dare take the risk then any non-professional (fund buyer) shouldn't either (under normal circumstances). PS.

There should be little risk for someone who claims to be able to beat the market. If they say that's too much risk, they likely don't think they can consistently beat the market. reply Maxatar 59 minutes agorootparentprevThat's right, fund managers expect their clients to take 100% of the downside risk and tax their clients 20% on the up side.

Presuming all strategies have a curve of diminishing marginal returns as assets under management increase, you would not expect any fund accepting outside money to have expected returns beating the market, but you would expect many of them to have a combination of correlation to the market and expected returns that would make them an attractive component in a basket of broad index ETFs and market-neutral funds. (Assuming risk-adjusted returns are the utility function being optimized. If variance is their preferred risk metric, this results in optimizing Sharpe ratio via mean-variance optimization, MVO.) It's fair to assume that any fund manager is optimizing the sum of returns from their own personal investments in the fund plus fees from outside investors. They pick the place on the volume/risk-adjusted-returns curve that still keeps their fund attractive enough to outside investors, and maximizes their personal profits (personal returns plus fund fees). If that optimal point on the volume/risk-adjusted returns curve for their particular strategy is at a point where risk-adjusted returns beat the market, then they maximize their returns by either never accepting outside funds (prop shops) or by not accepting additional funds and gradually buying out their investors (such as RenTech's famous Medallion fund). So, (assuming diminishing marginal returns) it's not rational to simultaneously accept outside investment and beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis. I suspect that many market-neutral funds could reliably beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis, but their volume/risk-adjusted-returns curve shape and their fee structures make it optimal for them to operate at a point on that curve where their expected returns are below the market. Note that this rational self-interest optimization below market returns isn't bad for the investors. Under most fee structures, it ends up being close to maximizing total investor returns. Increasing percentage returns would mean kicking out some investors. RenTech's Medallion Fund and many prop shops, and funds that are currently slowly buying out their investors seem to indicate there are at least some strategies where the optimal volume/returns trade-off is above market returns. You would expect all funds that are currently open to more outside investment to either be young and lacking capital or else have an optimal point on the volume/returns curve that is below market returns. Note that as previously mentioned, a simple mean-variance optimization on a basket would allocate funds to both index ETFs and market-neutral funds returning a bit under the market on average. It's entirely possible that both fund investors and fund managers are being perfectly rational. Of course, there are also plenty of people out there who fool themselves into thinking they know what they're doing. The world certainly isn't perfectly rational. I'm just saying that in a perfectly rational world, assuming (1) utility function of risk-adjusted-returns (e.g. Sharpe ratio, resulting in mean-variance-optimization) (2) declining marginal returns on investment, you would expect all funds accepting outside investors (except for young funds desperate for money) to under-perform the market in expected returns. Now, everyone talks about Sharpe ratio on the outside, but the particular risk models actually used internally by any fund are almost certainly not just variance of returns. I presume all funds simultaneously apply a mixture of commercially available risk models and internally developed risk models. Sharpe ratio is far from perfect, but it's a good least-common-denominator for discussion, and doesn't give away any secret sauce. Side note: it would be rational for someone to take you up on your proposal and simply use index futures to take a highly leveraged position on your benchmark index. As long as they had enough money to make you whole in the case of bad tracking error and large downturns, their expected returns would be large. However, you wouldn't be very smart to take such an agreement instead of just getting leverage yourself. This demonstrates why risk-adjusted returns are usually more important than expected returns. reply financltravsty 2 hours agoparentprevYou are not an UHNW individual/institutional investor, so no \"fund managers\" of any note are going to waste their time on this wager. \"Beating an index\" is really easy. Up to $10MM you can choose most any financial instrument class in the U.S markets and have a good probability of finding alpha for a long time (that would beat the S&P500 18.40% YTD). Many proprietary trading firms, or market makers, or quantitative trading shops do this regularly. Discretionary and systematic funds? Usually not. If their processes worked consistently, they would have no need to take outside capital and deal with relationship management. They could simply use more leverage (not exactly, but simplified for the general reader).

I haven't had much success getting any clear data about whether active management demonstrably produces better results. reply elil17 16 hours agoparentShort answer re: investing in active managers (based on my many years listening to rationalreminder.ca) is that, if you eliminate some of the worst active managers, the average returns net of fees are the same. However, eliminating the worst managers is challenging (but not impossible) to do ex-ante. Even then, you’re only getting the same average returns as indexing, not better. Plus, you will experience a higher dispersion with active managers (greater chance of extreme negative or positive outcome), which is not desirable. Because of these two issues, It’s definitely better to pick an index fund. Re: picking stocks yourself, the answer is also pretty cut and dry. There’s strong evidence no individual trader can expect to beat the market. Active managers can only beat the market gross of fees because they employ large teams of people to do a lot of work to gain a small edge (stuff like predicting retail sales numbers from satellite images of store parking lots). This is my attempt at summarizing a whole field of research in a few sentences. There are many more nuisances. I highly recommend listening to the Rational Reminder podcast if you’re curious about this sort of thing. They interview a lot of academics. reply Galanwe 13 hours agorootparentThere's more dimensions to an investment than average returns. Volatility adjusted returns (or Sharpe ratio) for instance, will tell you how much returns you have per unit of risk you take. This is important because getting 10% average annual returns with 10% annual volatility is worst than getting 5% returns with 1% annual volatility. You can only compare investments at equal amount of risk. An other factor to take into account is diversification. If you have an alternative investment to compare to your base, and it's average returns is lower than your base, but it is un correlated, then you actually get an increased volatility adjusted average returns by investing in both. That's just two dimensions to take into account, there are many others, but overall: - Don't compare investments based on annualized returns alone, it really doesn't make any sense. - Don't compare investments one against an other, instead look at the addivity of one on top of another. reply Karellen 8 hours agorootparent> getting 10% average annual returns with 10% annual volatility is worst than getting 5% returns with 1% annual volatility. Doesn't this depend on how long you're planning on investing for, and what your criteria for selling your investments are? If you're planning on investing for at least 10 years, and you're willing to give yourself a 2-3 year window for selling your investments once they reach a threshhold you decide on ahead of time, isn't the 10%/10% investment better? (e.g. if retirement is 20 years away, you might consider putting your funds in that sort of investment for 10 years, with a view to moving them to something less volatile in the 5 years after that, as soon as they cross a 10% annualised return threshhold during that window.) reply Galanwe 8 hours agorootparent> isn't the 10%/10% investment better? If you consider that \"you don't know any better\" and returns are normally distributed (i.e. you don't have some secret sauce nobody else knows about), then there is no dimension in which the 10/10 is better. You can convince yourself intuitively by imagining how you would maximize each strategy. The amount of money you have is a factor of the risk you take, because if you want to do something risky you will not be able to borrow much, whereas if you want to do something safe you can easily borrow. That is, you objective is to maximize your expected return, under the constraint of not breaking your risk limit. Suppose you have a 10% annualized volatility risk tolerance. That's your budget. If you invest it all in a 10% average return / 10% annual vol strategy, that's it. Now if I propose you a 5% average return / 1% volatility strategy, you just have to go to the bank and borrow 10x your capital.

Ponzi schemes, for example, will have a high empirical Sharpe ratio until they fail. Similarly, a fund that sells low-strike put options will have a high empirical Sharpe ratio until one of those puts is exercised, creating a large loss. In both cases, the empirical standard deviation before failure gives no real indication of the size of the risk being run. >Do you have any sort of reasoning or is it just a gut feeling? The reasoning is that their volatility is negligible over the long term due to political forces. Of course, it is also an assumption that could be wrong, but the mechanisms for government policy (democracy, aging demographics, and voter participation trends) seem to favor reducing purchasing power of currency rather than letting broad market equity prices stall or slide down. reply Galanwe 5 hours agorootparent> >However, financial assets are often not normally distributed, so that standard deviation does not capture all aspects of risk Volatility not being a full measure of risk obviously does not imply that volatility should be ignored. The former statement about returns not being normally distributed is a, trivially verifiable, factual mistake. Daily stock returns are normally distributed with a slight positive kurtosis.

Was I or the overwhelming majority of investors capable of realizing that and more importantly acting on it? Certainly not. But looking back it obviously wasn't random.

(Flip a fair coin enough times and it will come up heads 20 times in a row.) Also, some fraction of Buffet's success comes from deals that the rest of us don't have access to. reply mewpmewp2 5 hours agorootparentYeah, I have tried to simulate this several times under different conditions. Given zero sum game and random odds, there is always going to be small percentage who have a lot and most will have below what they started with. It is easy to explain as well, if you for example start with $1000 and you have 50% odds of winning 10% every time. If you win and lose 50% you are going to be below what you started. If you always win after lose and lose after win, then it would go like this: 1. $1000 2. $1100 3. $990 4. $1089 And so on... After 100 turns you would have only around 600 - 700. But it's a zero sum right. Where does the 300 - 400 go? It goes exponentially to select few who by random chance have more wins than losses. In fact the longer it goes on, the higher odds of there being outlier with a lot - you might expect that everyone would converge around $1000, but that is not the case. I did an example run with 10 000 investors, each doing 1000 trades, each trade they bet 10% of their portfolio, with 50% odds of winning. First investor had 562 wins and 438 losses, with $1,666,061. Median investor had only $7 left with 500 wins and 500 losses. Top 10th percentile investor had $364 with 520 wins and 480 losses. So interestingly even an investor that had 40 wins more than losses, lost 2/3 of portfolio. reply redox99 2 hours agorootparentStock market is not zero sum. reply mewpmewp2 31 minutes agorootparentYes, but in terms of beating the market it should be. reply JumpCrisscross 8 hours agorootparentprev> How does that explain Warren Buffet’s spectacular success?

Buffett has been underperforming the S&P 500 for about twenty years now: * https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/warren-buffett-has-underperfo... * https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37827101 For most people who are saving for retirement between the ages of (say) 30 to 65, that's most of their investing lifetime, and such underperform could radically effect the life they can live once they start working. Do you want risk your proverbial Golden Years simply because you chose not to take the market average returns? 2. While Buffett is a better-than-average investor (and certainly better than me), the main reason why we know him is because he's so rich, but as Morgan Housel notes, the vast majority of that wealth has come from compounding: > As I write this Warren Buffett’s net worth is $84.5 billion. Of that, $84.2 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday. $81.5 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s. Warren Buffett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a key point if you attach all of his success to investing acumen. The real key to his success is that he’s been a phenomenal investor for three quarters of a century. Had he started investing in his 30s and retired in his 60s, few people would have ever heard of him. Consider a little thought experiment. Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old. By the time he was 30 he had a net worth of $1 million, or $9.3 million adjusted for inflation.[16] What if he was a more normal person, spending his teens and 20s exploring the world and finding his passion, and by age 30 his net worth was, say, $25,000? And let’s say he still went on to earn the extraordinary annual investment returns he’s been able to generate (22% annually), but quit investing and retired at age 60 to play golf and spend time with his grandkids. What would a rough estimate of his net worth be today? Not $84.5 billion. $11.9 million. 99.9% less than his actual net worth. Effectively all of Warren Buffett’s financial success can be tied to the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the longevity he maintained in his geriatric years. His skill is investing, but his secret is time. That’s how compounding works. Think of this another way. Buffett is the richest investor of all time. But he’s not actually the greatest—at least not when measured by average annual returns. * https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10551666-more-than-2-000-bo... reply wenc 15 hours agoparentprevThe common refrain is that \"time in the market always beats timing the market\". The implicit assumption in that refrain is that, despite periodic dips, the U.S. stock market always goes up over time. This has been true since the Great Depression (see graph of S&P 500 since 1929) https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1929 The implicit assumption behind that is that the American economy always invents a way to grow. Buffet famously said, \"never bet against America\". For as long as these assumptions match reality, it's likely that passive management will continue to succeed. reply jackcosgrove 5 hours agorootparent> American economy always invents a way to grow There are various macroeconomic models which attempt to explain the factors of growth, for example the Solow growth model. In this model technological advancement is only one of three factors. The others are the savings rate and the population growth rate. According to this model, you may not be able to innovate your way to growth if one or both of the other factors are contrary to growth. This may sound academic but there are concrete examples in the last twenty years of countries that have not grown because of a stagnant or shrinking working age population, e.g. Japan and Italy. This has no bearing on the passive vs active debate, as I'm fairly confident that passive investing will always be the better strategy for a retail investor regardless of the growth potential of an economy. It's just in a country with unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, passive investing may be the way to minimize losses rather than maximize gains. The assumption of continued growth will probably hold true for the American economy through the end of the century at least, so for everyone here investing in US equities it is academic. But we can try to decompose an economy into factors and use those to check whether we expect growth to occur at all. reply qwytw 6 hours agorootparentprev> time in the market always beats timing the market > The implicit assumption in that refrain is that, Only if you were fine with waiting 50-100 years. The market in 1950 was more or less at the same level in real terms as in 1906, of course dividends were way higher back in those days. If we take that into: e.g. if you invested 200$ in S&P 500 in 1906 adjusted by inflation in 1950 you would have had ~$1570 in 1950. Which is an average annual return of ~4.7% which is not terrible but you would have made approximately the same by buying high grade corporate bonds just with way less volatility. reply 317070 13 hours agorootparentprevThat is too strong of a condition. The economy doesn't need to grow for passive investing to work. Even when the economy is flat, passive management works. As long as companies are economically productive, capitalism will hand over a chunk of the profits to the owners of the capital. Of course, growth increases the size of that chunk year over year, but capitalism doesn't stop when growth stops. Active investing is when you are looking to exceed this passive margin by timing your trades well. Active investing requires changes in productivity (such as growth). reply kjksf 7 hours agorootparentReturns from stock investing come from increasing stock prices. Stock prices increase when earnings of the company grow. In other words: when the economy grows. You can argue that Amazon and Apple and Google and Facebook etc. will grow earnings even if the overall economy is flat or shrinks but I don't see how that would apply to passive investing i.e. investing in S&P 500 i.e. investing in 500 largest US companies. S&P 500 is U.S. economy and they all are sensitive to overall economic situation. If people have less money, they buy less stuff. Amazon makes less money, their stock goes down. Apple sells less iPhones, their stock goes down. All other companies make less money, they spend less on advertising, Google and Facebook make less money. I don't see a scenario where overall U.S. (or world) economy declines and S&P 500 doesn't decline. In fact, declining economy is an argument for active investing. Even when overall economy declines, among 6000 companies listed on stock market there will be some that will be growing and if you invest in them, you'll make money. reply 317070 6 hours agorootparent> Returns from stock investing come from increasing stock prices. There are other ways to make returns. Return from stock comes mainly from increasing stock prices and from dividends. But fundamentally, it comes from profits. > Stock prices increase when earnings of the company grow. There are many reasons stock prices increase. But whether it does or doesn't isn't really relevant. When a company makes a profit, either: * the profit is reinvested, the value of the company grows and the stock price grows, making a return for the passive investor * the profit is returned as dividends, making the passive investor a return as well. No growth needed for the individual companies either. As long as they are profitable, they make a steady return for the passive investor. Thought experiment: imagine a company which is going to make 1 dollar of profit per year for all eternity, which it returns as dividends. For an investor with a discount rate of 95%, that company is worth 20 dollars. Say he buys the company for 20 dollars. After 10 years, that company is still worth 20 dollars, as eternity is still eternity, but the passive investor owning the company has made 10 dollars from the company. As you can see, the passive investor made a return, despite the company only being profitable, but not growing nor shrinking. You will make a return on your investment when your investment makes a profit, that is capitalism. Whether the profit is increasing, decreasing, flat or going in circles does not really matter, as long as it is a profit and not a loss. reply stkdump 5 hours agorootparentThis is all correct, but missing the higher order. Most investors will not take out the dividends, but reinvest them. A few might sell, because they are in retirement. But assuming that the retired people make up a small part of investors, profit is reinvested. Further, people invest a percentage of their income for retirement. All that means that work income and dividends make the stock prices go up and retirement makes the stock prices go down. You could say that retired people consume and help companies make profit, but it is actually worse for stock prices than investment, because the consumption requires companies to sell products and services that come with cost. reply cess11 6 hours agorootparentprevFor me returns on personal investment in stocks, funds and ETF:s consist largely of dividends. reply immibis 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd the assumption that the stock market will go up from now is itself a form of timing the market.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally, days before he was to accept the Republican nomination for a third time. A barrage of gunfire set off panic, and a bloodied Trump, who said he was shot in the ear, was surrounded by Secret Service and hurried to his SUV as he pumped his fist in a show of defiance. Trump’s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing “fine” after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his social media site. ▶ Follow the AP’s live coverage on the Trump rally shooting The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The agency said the investigation remains active and ongoing. Secret Service agents fatally shot Crooks, who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue at a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency said. One attendee was killed and two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. All were identified as men.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election. And it could alter the tenor and security posture at the Republican National Convention, which will begin Monday in Milwaukee. Organizers said the convention would proceed as planned. Trump flew to New Jersey after visiting a local Pennsylvania hospital, landing shortly after midnight at Newark Liberty International Airport. Video posted by an aide showed the former president deplaning his private jet flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents and heavily armed members of the agency’s counter assault team, an unusually visible show of force by his protective detail. RELATED COVERAGE A look at the history of presidential assassination attempts in America Biden delivers remarks a day after Trump rally shooting. Follow live updates A few short minutes after Trump took the stage, shots rang out President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump, was briefed on the incident and spoke to Trump several hours after the shooting, the White House said. “There’s no place in America for this type of violence,” the president said in public remarks. “It’s sick. It’s sick.” Biden planned to return to Washington early, cutting short a weekend at his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.” Officials said members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team killed the shooter. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection. Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a third person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. An AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos from the scene of the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking.

Puskar) Read More A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a person wearing gray camouflage lying motionless on the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds where Trump’s rally was held. The roof where the person lay was less than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle. The AR-15, like the shooter at the Trump rally had, is the semi-automatic civilian version of the military M-16. Asked at the press conference whether law enforcement did not know the shooter was on the roof until he began firing, Kevin Rojek, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, responded that “that is our assessment at this time.” Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is surround by U.S. Secret Service agents at a campaign rally, Saturday, July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pa.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and “taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.” A rally disrupted by gunfire Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the gunfire began after 6:10 p.m. As the first pop rang out, Trump said, “Oh,” and the raised his hand to his right ear and looked at it, before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern. The people in the stands behind him also crouched down as screams rang through the crowd. Someone could be heard near the microphone saying, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents rushed to the stage. They piled atop the former president to shield him with their bodies, as is their training protocol, as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat. Screams were heard in the crowd of several thousand people. A woman screamed louder than the rest. Afterward, voices were heard saying “shooter’s down” several times, before someone asked “are we good to move?” and “are we clear?” Then, someone ordered, “Let’s move.” Trump could be heard on the video saying at least twice, “Let me get my shoes, let me get my shoes,” with another voice heard saying, “I’ve got you sir.” 1 of 8U.S. Secret Service agents respond as Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is surrounded on stage by U.S. Secret Service agents at a campaign rally, Saturday, July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pa.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Read More Trump got to his feet moments later and could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his face, which was smeared with blood on his face. He then pumped his fist in the air and appeared to mouth the word “Fight” twice to his crowd of supporters, prompting loud cheers and then chants of “USA. USA. USA.” The crowd cheered as he got back up and pumped his fist. His motorcade left the venue moments later. Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover “Everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew, everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. Eventually, first responders were able to carry the injured person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring. When it was clear the situation had been contained and Trump would not return to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. One man in an electric wheelchair got stuck on the field when his chair’s battery died. Others tried to help him move. undefined Election 2024 Trump-shooting intro and wrap 131 Law enforcement officials say it appears somebody tried to kill Donald Trump as he spoke at a Pennsylvania rally Saturday. Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.” Two firefighters from nearby Steubenville, Ohio, who were at the rally told the AP that they helped people who appeared injured and heard bullets hitting broadcast speakers. “The bullets rattled around the grandstand, one hit the speaker tower and then chaos broke. We hit the ground and then the police converged into the grandstands,” Chris Takach said. “The first thing I heard is a couple of cracks,” Dave Sullivan said. Sullivan said he saw one of the speakers get hit and bullets rattling and, “we hit the deck.” He said once Secret Service and other authorities converged on Trump, he and Takach assisted two people who may have been shot in the grandstand and cleared a path to get them out of the way. “Just a sad day for America,” said Sullivan, who recalled that fluid sprayed from a mechanical line on the stage before a speaker tower started to fall. Related coverage Condemnation of Trump rally shooting crosses party lines, and blame game and calls for probe begin Biden says ‘everybody must condemn’ attack on Trump and later speaks with ex-president A few short minutes after Trump took the stage, shots rang out “Then we heard another shot that, you could hear, you knew something was, it was bullets. It wasn’t firecrackers,” he said. Political violence again shakes America The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008. Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security. Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the three men on Trump’s shortlist for vice president, all quickly sent out statements expressing concern for the former president, with Rubio sharing an image taken as Trump was escorted off stage with his fist in the air and a streak of blood on his face along with the words “God protected President Trump.” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement on X that he had been briefed on the situation and Pennsylvania state police were on hand at the rally site. “Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States,” he said. ___ Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington. Tucker reported from Westport, Connecticut.

I always took the second amendment to mean a collective right to gun ownership, but not an individual one as it explicitly mentions the militia. However, it seems to be a fairly common belief that it is to keep the government at bay and prevent tyranny. Well if any individual can own a gun, and believes in such and interpretation, what can be done to stop them? reply s1artibartfast 16 hours agorootparent2A was always meant to be about individual ownership. At the time the rationale for a right was frequently included in the text, just as a modern reading of the right implies it is being used as an explanatory clause. The entire concept was that there would be no governmental army and in times of need, citizens would be able to use their arms and organize for mutual defense. In this context, \"Militia\" is synonymous with an decentralized armed citizenry without government oversight. The clause provides this rationale and coveys a sentiment against a standing army. here are what some state constitutions had to say about gun ownership, prior to the bill of rights. Article XIII of the Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights of 1776 read: >That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. Similarly, as another example, Massachusetts’s Declaration of Rights from 1780 provided: >The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it. James Madison produced an initial draft of the Second Amendment as follows: >The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person. I pulled the quotes from this link, which has more text and discussion. https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt2-2/ALDE_... reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours agorootparentThe first clause of the second amendment wasn’t judged perfunctory until about 2013. It was never seen that way when the founding fathers were alive, or during most of America’s history. The NRA started the movement to eliminate the first clause from having any legal meaning at all in the late 1970s by simply excluding it when they recited it. reply s1artibartfast 3 hours agorootparentI provided my position with extensive rationale, citations from context, and a link to learn more. Do you have anything to support your position? anything in the federalist papers? What about the simple fact of reality of the time that every citizen was allowed to own arms without being in a formal organization? reply seanmcdirmid 3 hours agorootparentThe constitution is limitations on the government, not citizens. It doesn’t mean citizens only have the right to own weapons for militia use, it just means the government cannot restrict them for such. How the NRA rewrote the the 2A: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-... The decision to legally depower the first clause of the 2A came in 2008, not 2013, sorry about that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller In the 18 and 19th century, commentary around the 2A included the militia requirement, focusing more on what a militia was than if it was a requirement at all (see wiki commentary section in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United...). The idea that militia isn’t a requirement doesn’t even come into play until the late 20th century and is legally deleted in the 21st. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentI think your first link is revisionist history and rhetoric. IT isn't consistent with English common law, contemporary practice, or the other evidence. If the information already included in your own Wikipedia links dont convince you of this, I wont be able to either. Similarly, I don't buy the argument that it only restricts the federal government, not the states. The 10th amendment is clear that states are prohibited from infringing on some individual rights. This is obviously the case with the 6th through 8th,unless you think states and cities are free to conduct juryless trials and have cruel and unusual punishments reply HaZeust 19 hours agorootparentprevI’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this idea over the years, and I truly think that with the stats of having more guns than people in a country like the USA, the average person ought to have more faith in humanity since gun violence is not nearly as much as you’d think. reply spurgu 29 minutes agorootparentVery much agree. The vast majority of Americans have never even witnessed a gun fired in public. Which is crazy if you think like a European might: \"If everybody had guns then bad people would just shoot other people all the time\". There is nothing in ordinary American life hinting that guns are dangerous. You have to look at statistics in order to form some kind of an idea that there is a problem. The fact that there are so few incidents, relatively speaking, speaks volumes for the decency of the people, how responsible they are with their guns. I like to draw an analogy to the Nordic countries where we have \"the freedom to roam\". Anyone can roam around on public (and even private) land and put up their tent for the night, pick berries etc. This causes very little problems, because people learn from a young age to behave responsibly in nature. But then you have (too) many countries in Europe where wild camping is illegal. That means there's no culture around it. And the thought is that if they now made it legal it would just exacerbate the problems they have now, like people throwing trash in nature, causing wildfires etc. Yes, in the short term it probably would, because you just neutered people's ability to display responsible behavior by not letting them create a culture around it. If people are raised with that responsibility it tends to not become a problem during adulthood. That's why I support gun rights in practically every country. Teach people from a young age to be responsible with guns and let that flourish in adult life. Trust people. Don't punish everyone for a few bad eggs. reply skissane 19 hours agorootparentprevThe original meaning of the Second Amendment was the federal government couldn't take away your right to own a gun – but whether state or local governments could was outside of the scope of the federal constitution, it was a matter for state constitutions and state laws to determine. At the time it was passed, state and local laws imposing limits on gun ownership were widespread (often on grounds of race or property ownership) – and the Second Amendment was not seen as contradicting those laws in any way. Then they passed the 14th Amendment. And the original intention behind the 14th Amendment, was nothing to do with guns at all – it was to protect the rights of the recently freed slaves – nobody was even thinking about guns at the time they voted for it. And then, decades later, the Supreme Court started to interpret the 14th Amendment as applying parts of the Bill of Rights to the states. They used the 14th to apply the 1st to the states in the 1925 case of Gitlow v. New York. And then in the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago they did that to the 2nd as well. It was hard to argue not to do it with the 2nd when they'd already done it with most of the others. reply lamontcg 4 hours agorootparent> The original meaning of the Second Amendment was the federal government couldn't take away your right to own a gun There's also that \"well regulated militia\" bit in the text. We could require several months of membership in a firearms club and a minimum level of proficiency required to be displayed at a gun range, and it shouldn't violate any SANE interpretation of the Second Amendment, while keeping random 18-20 year olds from being able to buy an AR15 on a psychotic whim. We also routinely required guns to be surrendered inside of cities back in the 1800s because we understood that there was a difference between being armed on your private property and being armed while getting smashed in a bar. reply klyrs 2 hours agorootparent> We also routinely required guns to be surrendered inside of cities back in the 1800s because we understood that there was a difference between being armed on your private property and being armed while getting smashed in a bar.

Because if that was the case then it simply the federal government is the ones that cannot compel you to be a witness against yourself or the federal government cannot deprive you of your security of property or papers and the federal government is the one that cannot limit your freedom of speech but the state can do all of those things at will without regard to any federal powers. If that's your official position please state that clearly because the supreme Court has said that the second amendment is not a second class freedom compared to the others. And it was never the intention for it to be by the founders. reply skissane 18 hours agorootparent> The way you're talking about the second amendment I expect that you don't want the same interpretation applied to the first amendment the Fourth amendment or the 5th amendment. No, I'm saying that a consistent originalist interpretation would be that the Bill of Rights should not be applied to the States, absent a constitutional amendment clearly stating that, and understood as stating that at the time it was adopted. The 14th Amendment was adopted in 1868, it wasn't interpreted as applying the 1st to the states until 1925 – over 50 years later. If people wanted states to be bound by the 1st Amendment – or the 2nd or the 4th or the 5th – they should have passed a constitutional amendment explicitly saying so, not relied on SCOTUS to de facto amend it by interpreting the 14th as saying something that few thought it meant at the time it was adopted. reply beaglesss 18 hours agorootparentnext [6 more] [flagged] skissane 18 hours agorootparentI disagree: I think the reference to \"arms\" was originally understood as applying primarily to small arms, not artillery. I think, in the first few decades of the 2nd Amendment being in force, federal restrictions on purely private ownership of artillery – and especially large artillery – would likely have been upheld, while federal restrictions on purely private ownership of small arms would almost surely have been struck down. While people at the time could not have foreseen nuclear weapons, they are more like large artillery than small arms, so I think federal restrictions on purely private ownership of them would likely have been upheld even given the original meaning of the 2nd Amendment. (By \"purely private\", I mean to exclude military units organised by state or local governments.) reply beaglesss 18 hours agorootparentDude you could buy a cannon at the founding (and still can no background check). reply skissane 17 hours agorootparentThe point is, if the federal government had tried to restrict private ownership of certain kinds of artillery in the early 19th century, would it have been held to have violated the 2nd? Nobody can say for sure, because the issue (to my knowledge) never came up – but if it did, I expect SCOTUS would have drawn a legal distinction between small arms commonly used for infantry, hunting and personal self-defense, versus larger scale military weapons. Such a distinction can be defended on originalist grounds, since small arms was the primary thing the people who voted for the 2nd were thinking about. It actually raises an interesting historical question – to which I don't know the answer – in the debates on the proposal and ratification of the 2nd, was the status of larger scale weapons under it ever raised? reply thinkmassive 16 hours agorootparentprevYou could own a fleet of ships all outfitted with many cannons reply beaglesss 6 hours agorootparentCurious why my post about cannons was flagged but not similar facts about warships.

I was arguing that, on originalist grounds, incorporation ought to be rejected, which would mean no incorporation for the 2nd – but not for the 1st either. Whereas I'm not sure what you are even trying to say. reply silverquiet 18 hours agorootparentprevIt seems like you’re being downvoted and disagreed with but I was under the impression the process you are talking about was known as incorporation and was rather widely understood constitutional law. reply skissane 18 hours agorootparentYes, but what I'm saying is the \"incorporation\" was invented by the Supreme Court, almost out of thin air. A consistent originalist would reject the doctrine entirely. Okay, they read it out of the intentionally vague language of the 14th Amendment. But nobody who voted for the 14th thought that it meant that. Everyone who voted for the 14th actually knew what it meant at the time – it was a narrow measure to stop Democrats from taking away the civil rights of newly freed slaves. It was written in a vague and ambiguous way as a political fudge to make it easier for legislators to vote for it, given many of their (racist/pro-confederate) constituents opposed it. It was not written with the intention that it would be read as carte blanche imposing the near whole of the Bill of Rights on the states, which is essentially what incorporation amounts to. reply tithe 19 hours agoparentprevI think part of the answer is how you phrased the situation yourself, as a \"battle of ideas.\" The rhetoric by both \"left\" and \"right\" platforms pitches a divided America, and a \"battle for the soul of the nation.\" Battle against whom? My own countrymen? For what? For my vision for America? I was unsettled when I heard this (but maybe I'm just too sensitive.) When you combine this kind of inflammatory speech with blanket group classifications like \"liberals\" or \"MAGA\" or \"democrats\" or whatever, you've now identified an enemy in this \"battle\", and as I've seen lately, can completely lose sight that these people are our countrymen too. reply AnimalMuppet 19 hours agorootparentThe language on both sides is apocalyptic - if we don't win this election, it's the end of America!

This level of violence isn't new. This has never been new. There's always been stuff like this. Yes, today's era of political polarization is bad, but the US seems to go through cycles of great polarization and regrettably frequent violence followed by fairly calm periods - at least by one metric (e.g, by 'civil wars' 1860-65 was the worst, but if you measured by violent labor strikes the late 1800s-early 1900s were). Thus you get the American Revolution, then a period of relative calm, then the years leading up to the Civil War and the Civil War itself. Then a period of relative quiet, followed by the much smaller strikes, which often turned violent, as well as pogroms against blacks. Then relative quiet, then Vietnam, Civil Rights, etc. Summary of the data following: Proceeding in fifty-year intervals back from 2020-July 13,2024, ending at 1770-July 13, 1774, this era placed #2 in civil unrest, but #4 out of 6 - ie, below average - in a broader category, counting coups, massacres, civil unrest, rebellions, worker deaths due to labor disputes, and racial violence. For a sense of the persistence of it, look at Wikipedia's page[1]. In fact, if anything, it seems to be slowing down; Wikipedia (thus far) lists 17 incidents from 2020-2024 (inclusive). Scrolling 50, 100, 150, 200, etc. years back shows the following: 50 years ago [1970-July 13,1974]: 28 (!) 100 years ago [1920-July 13,1924]: 9. 150 years ago [1870-July 13,1874]: 10. Again, possibly an underestimate. 200 years ago [1820-July 13,1824]: 0. This is almost certainly an underestimate, but it's how many Wikipedia lists. 250 years ago [1770-July 13, 1774]: 5[2] So, we're the second-highest. However, Wikipedia also helpfully has lists of coup attempts, massacres, etc. So!

This is what I can't understand - the sitting president and their party put the country in a position where, if one person had bowed to their pressure, the election would have been overturned. Many of these people specifically worked towards this goal, sending fake electors - and the president explicitely supported this whole scheme, while everyone was telling him that there was no evidence for the election being rigged. How are any citizens supposed to be okay with this? Even if Trump fully believed his own lies, it doesn't make this one bit better.

I think it's fair to say Trump incited a riot and was directing the energy at Pence, because that was the legal option left. He could have instead demanded a recount and have the entire crowd protest the entire election instead of that specific move of the electoral certification. An intent to actually overthrow the government would have been a bigger coordinated effort instead of plausible deniable acts that failed rather quickly. At worst Trump is an opportunist here and that doesn't seem enough to call it an insurrection. > A delay wasn't going to make people change their minds, but direct threats of violence (remember the chants and the gallows?) stoked by the sitting president sure could have. There was a time that Trump had to take cover in a bunker because of some riots (link below), and that was never called an insurrection. And of course there have been lots of threats directed at Trump since 2016. The only difference in J6 was that it had to do with election results, but in theory that should be something that can be protested, and as a result it can devolve into a riot. > This is what I can't understand - the sitting president and their party put the country in a position where, if one person had bowed to their pressure, the election would have been overturned. I just don't think this can be coerced by force. It's not like you point a gun at Pence and he signs some papers and democracy is over. Everybody would need to witness Pence changing his mind willingly. It works through legal means and political consensus. If it becomes obvious that Pence did something against his own will, then it's a criminal matter that delays the process, and there is no way Pence would be coerced AND also pretend like everything is alright. All of those tweets are talking about the process itself and what legal paths to take. If there was a real intention to overthrow the government, there is no need to stick to the legal paths. I can grant that the tone of the tweets is careless and also expected of Trump, but in my opinion the four years of getting attacked relentlessly by the media and political establishment contributes to this. > How are you not all extremely scared of the consequences for your country? The constitution and the branches of government are structured in a way that prevents this type of corruption. The track record of no dictators is evidence of this, compared to Europe who had so many dictators in the 20th century.

Yes, it was his only legal option left to overturn the election and stay in power. This means that he attempted to overturn the election and stay in power. Our whole discussion should end here, but somehow his attempt is supposed to be acceptable, because it relies on a never-before used reading of documents, which coincidentally could have been allowed by the same courts he stacked? > An intent to actually overthrow the government would have been a bigger coordinated effort instead of plausible deniable acts that failed rather quickly. At worst Trump is an opportunist here and that doesn't seem enough to call it an insurrection. But there was a bigger coordinated effort. Fake electors were actually sent and stood ready. Republicans coordinated with leaders of multiple organizations, including the Proud Boys, and organized the rally close to the Capitol. Dozens of people worked to make the whole plot possible, and only a few individuals stopped it by not going along, which Trump attempted to coerce via indirect threats of violence. I won't engage in discussions on your second paragraph - you're completely misrepresenting the situation, and I don't think that this point was brought up in good faith. There was no coordination by Democrats with members of supporting organizations, or anything comparable to fake electors, during the situation you mentioned.

Because it was about taking the available legal paths, and going into the details of that is already stretching the definition of insurrection. It could be a bad faith attempt at bending the rules, but that is still within the bounds of the system. Also every president will appoint judges that are favorable to their side, all the other presidents did the same. The larger coordination that you mention is mostly due to a combination of two things. Trust in the institutions is extremely low, and Trump has been running on narrative of being the victim of those who represent those institutions (aka the establishment). This motivates large unstructured groups that can only coordinate indirectly (through action/reaction), and since they all share the same perspective it might seem more coordinated than it is. In short I see dirty politics and bending the rules on both sides creating a vicious cycle. Trump won 2016 unexpectedly by doubling down on bad rhetoric, then the Democrats and media thought he deserved to be relentlessly attacked along with his supporters for four years (for saying mean things, or saying the wrong things). This incentivized his supporters to go along with Trump's attempt at bending the rules and causing a riot over losing the election, which then made Democrats throw the entire book at him with all kinds of charges, which inevitably looks like they are going after him for political reasons, cementing the narrative that the establishment is corrupt (whether or not it is, it creates the perception). Hopefully it's not too late for each side to reflect on how they contributed to this cycle. Whoever wins in November isn't going to end the country, unless people actually believe it and that creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. reply Timon3 2 hours agorootparentHas any sitting president before Trump tried to abuse this loophole to stay in power? You're acting like this is all regular business, like it's just what presidents do. It doesn't matter whether the stacked courts could have interpreted the rules to make this loophole legal. Trump attempted to overturn an election and keep power. This is not a \"both sides\" issue, this is one side not holding their leaders accountable and attempting to end democracy to stay in power.

And honestly, what kind of defense is that? \"Yeah, the sitting president attempted to overturn the election and stay in power, but theoretically this never-before used procedural loophole could give his VP the right to ignore the election results due to the terrorist attack committed by the presidents followers\" - you can't seriously think this is acceptable behavior for your leaders, right?

The American political system was explicitly designed not to empower the will of the majority, because that would have been an existential threat to the status quo (slavery) at the time. And while it might be nice to claim that we should be civil participants in a battle of ideas, it would be naive to ignore the effect of centuries of gun culture and polarizing neo-reactionary rhetoric on American politics. Regardless of what the founding fathers may have intended (and notwithstanding that they disagreed on many things) a lot of Americans believe political violence is a necessity and a virtue.

He's notorious for openly calling for his political enemies to be persecuted, jailed, shot, hanged, punched, etc. The pearl-clutching in response to this incident is so cringe, so fake.

Immediately after, there is a three-round burst of automatic fire, then several seconds later there is a single silenced shot (\"kill confirmed\") all likely secret service.

Edit: After watching this: https://twitter.com/BNONews/status/1812327502028669328 It seems like the first 3 and then next 5 (not 4) shots were from the shooter, and there was a single sniper shot returned by secret service immediately after (some echo made it sound like a 3 round burst in the first video), with the final follow up confirmation shot several seconds later. reply mvdtnz 17 hours agorootparentprevYour concern about anti-right-wing violence is that there might be violence from the right wing? You're not at all concerned about the violence itself? reply autoexec 16 hours agorootparentOf course I am. I never implied otherwise. I just think it's very reasonable to be concerned that this incident could have caused a swift escalation in the already ongoing violence if Trump had been killed. Remember that Trump supporters in particular have a long history of using violence to further their political aims including an attack on the capitol building with the intent to interfere, through violence and intimidation, with a free and fair election by preventing congress from counting the Electoral College votes. They've gone so far as to attempt to kidnap a political rival, but what they haven't done (to my knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong) is actually shoot one. Considering that Trump's supporters were calling for violent retribution (https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-supporters-call-riots...) just weeks ago over a verdict against Trump, I think it's reasonable to conclude that more violence after a successful assassination would be likely. Honestly, it might still happen, but I'm really hoping it doesn't. Everyone I've seen on the left has spoken out against the shooter. The left does not want violence or war. Long before this incident Trump supporters have been asking for exactly that (https://www.businessinsider.com/new-us-civil-war-wont-look-l...) and in some cases trying to instigate it. Seeing this kind of violence from the left (if that turns out to be the case, little is known about the shooter at this point) is very disturbing, but as troubling as it is when someone starts shooting at a powder keg it's also completely normal to brace for the explosion which could follow. reply nailer 5 hours agorootparentOne protest at congress and some nut picking does not equate to a summer of violent rioting and mainstream left-wing sources indulging in conspiracy theories (eg Russiagate and fine people) and repeating calling Trump a fascist and a threat to democracy. reply mvdtnz 12 hours agorootparentprevAgain you seem concerned about hypothetical right wing violence on a day of actual left wing violence. Very interesting. reply chgs 4 hours agorootparentLeft wing violence from a registered Republican? Perhaps motives are best left for the clear light of day. reply autoexec 10 hours agorootparentprevMore correctly: I'm concerned about the continuation of the very real right wing violence Trump's supporters have repeatedly demonstrated, as well as a potential escalation of that violence in retaliation for an assassination attempt (especially in the hypothetical where it had been successful) which was carried out by a person who hasn't been identified as being left wing or right wing, but who quite likely was left wing/will be assumed to be left wing regardless of who they turn out to have been and regardless of what their true motivations actually were. Of course, it probably isn't as \"interesting\" when phrased that way but feel free to stick to the least charitable interpretation or phrasing you can think of if you need to. EDIT: looks like they ID'd the shooter. Motivations are still being investigated but it appears that he's a Republican (according to state voter records). The closest thing I've seen so far to a sign that he hated Trump before the shooting was a one time $15 donation to ActBlue on Biden's Inauguration Day. reply skissane 9 hours agorootparent> EDIT: looks like they ID'd the shooter. Motivations are still being investigated but it appears that he's a Republican (according to state voter records). He was registered as a Republican, but he also made a small donation to Democrats. As the NYT reports: [0] > A voter-registration record showed that Mr. Crooks was registered as a Republican, though federal campaign-finance records show he donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a liberal voter turnout group, through the Democratic donation platform ActBlue in January 2021. State voter registration is pretty meaningless. Some people haven't voted for party X for years, but have never bothered to switch their voter registration away from it. Some people never really supported party X at all, but registered under it so they could vote in its primary (relevant in a closed primary state such as Pennsylvania) I think we really need to hold off making assumptions about the shooter's politics were until we get some harder evidence.

Please see my reply further down in which I realise this. ---- IIRC, people have never been able to vouch for flagged articles, only for flagged comments. You gain your ability to vouch for flagged comments once your reputation hits a certain cutoff; rarely, you might lose it if dang feels you are abusing your vouching ability. I believe the only way to vouch for flagged articles, is an informal vouching process in which you email dang and try to convince him to turn the flag off manually.

I should add though that it being flagged by admins is less about political bias and more about the topic immediately resulting in a flame war. reply skissane 17 hours agorootparentI'm guessing it might also depend on the number of flags. Since this site isn't open source (except for a very old version) we can only guess at how it works. But my guess is it might work like this: 1. Every time someone flags an article, it increments the \"flagged\" counter 2. Once the flagged counter reaches a certain threshold, it becomes flagged – but vouched is displayed to eligible users 3. If an eligible user vouches it, the \"flagged\" counter is decremented again – if it falls beneath the threshold, it is automatically unflagged 4. However, there is a second threshold, and once the \"flagged\" counter reaches that, then nobody can vouch it any more And that's not mentioning the ability of admins to manually override, either by forcing an article to flagged (so vouching isn't possible), or by disabling flagging on it (so votes to flag it are ignored) reply lolinder 17 hours agorootparentprevI'm the opposite—I've only ever been able to vouch for flagged articles, the vouch button for comments is always missing when I need it. reply skissane 17 hours agorootparentOkay, I now realise my memory is confused.

Supports cloud platforms, bare metal, and virtualization platforms All system management is done via an API. No SSH, shell or console Production ready: supports some of the largest Kubernetes clusters in the world Open source project from the team at Sidero Labs It only takes 3 minutes to launch a Talos cluster on your laptop inside Docker. Try it now Why Talos Linux? Security Talos reduces your attack surface. It's minimal, hardened and immutable. All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. Predictability Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic updates. Evolvability Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions. Features Minimal Talos consists of only a handful of binaries and shared libraries: just enough to run containerd and a small set of system services. This aligns with NIST's recommendation in the Application Container Security Guide. Hardened Hardened by design: Built with the Kernel Self Protection Project configuration recommendations. All access to the API is secured with Mutual TLS. Settings and configuration described in the CIS guidelines are applied by default. Immutable Talos improves security further by mounting the root filesystem as read-only and removing any host-level such as a shell and SSH. Ephemeral Talos runs in memory from a SquashFS, and persists nothing, leaving the primary disk entirely to Kubernetes. Current Delivers the latest stable versions of Kubernetes and Linux.

    "commentBody": "Talos: Secure, immutable, and minimal Linux OS for running Kubernetes (talos.dev)168 points by sea-gold 22 hours agohidepastfavorite65 comments JustinGarrison 2 hours agoThanks for the interest in Talos Linux! I work at Sidero (creators of Talos) and there are lots of “secure, immutable, and minimal” Linux distos out there. Something that Talos does differently is everything is an API. Machine configuration, upgrades, debugging…it’s all APIs. This helps with maintaining systems way beyond the usual cloud-init and systemd wrappers in other “minimal” distros. The second big change is Talos Linux is only designed for Kubernetes. It’s not a generic Linux kernel+container runtime. The init system was designed to run the kubelet and publish an API that feels like a Kubernetes native component. This drastically reduces the Linux knowledge required to run, scale, and maintain a complex system like Kubernetes. I’ve been doing a set of live streams called Talos Linux install fest walking new users through setting up their first cluster on Talos. Each install is in a new environment so please check it out. https://www.youtube.com/siderolabs/streams reply amluto 15 hours agoprevI considered deploying Talos a few weeks ago, and I ran into this: https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/issues/8367 Unless I’ve missed something, this isn’t a big deal in an AWS-style cloud where extra storage volumes (EBS, etc) have essentially no incremental cost, and maybe it’s okay on bare metal if the bare metal is explicitly designed with a completely separate boot disk (this includes Raspberry Pi using SD for boot and some other device for actual storage), but it seemed like a mostly showstopping issue for an average server that was specced with the intent to boot off a partition. I suppose one could fudge it with NVMe namespaces if the hardware cooperates. (I’ve never personally tried setting up a nontrivial namespace setup.) Has anyone set up Talos in a useful way on a server with a single disk or a single RAID array? reply rstat1 13 hours agoparentThis is my main issue with it right now, I'm wasting a whole physical disk in one of my home lab machines because Talos demands control over a full disk for its uses. This is one of the more annoying problems with any \"immutable\" distro (or at least the ones I've tried). They demand a very specific partition layout that basically forces you to devote a whole disk to them, which as you said in a cloud environment (or any other environment where VMs are used in place of physical machines) doesn't matter, but ends up mattering a lot when using physical machines. reply sroussey 13 hours agorootparentI’m curious on your use case. I’ve always had boot disk or boot disk array separate from any data array. Are you referring to things like a home directory? reply amluto 13 hours agorootparentI’m referring to a server without a dedicated boot disk. This is not especially rare. On an edge-style machine, you generally have a very limited number of M.2 slots, and dedicating one to a boot device uses up potentially 100% of your potential storage capacity, not to mention that an extra drive would be a non negligible fraction of total cost. On modern servers, there may not be a usable SATA controller, and NVMe usually costs 4 PCIe lanes. Those aren’t free. You also end up paying the absurd OEM premium for an extra disk if you go with a big name OEM. Sadly, there is no industry standard cheap, reliable boot device standard, at least as far as I’ve ever seen. Maybe someone should push USB3 for this use case — the price is certainly right, and performance is likely just fine. reply vetinari 7 hours agorootparentServer machines usually came with an SD-card slot on the board (and with ability to boot from it). This was often used for ESXi-like environments, which also required dedicated device for themselves. There are also SATA-DOMs or USB-DOMs. You could use one of these modules with your machine. reply taskforcegemini 9 hours agorootparentprevis there a reason you can't just boot from usb? it sounds like the perfect match. I've built immutable bootsticks in the past that run in ram only (but with other distros). hetzner for instance lets you rent usb-sticks for their dedicated servers reply amluto 8 hours agorootparentFWIW, it’s been a little while since I’ve messed with the low-level details of BIOS/UEFI to kernel+united to USB root disk handoff, but I’m always slightly concerned that the system will mess up and hand off to the wrong device. For a system that uses USB for anything else, this opens up an attack/screwup vector in which the wrong disk gets used, leading to all manner of problems. Also, an external dangly thing is asking for trouble (getting dislodged). An internal device solves this. In any case, the Talos people seem to recognize this as a problem and are working on it. reply lknuth 10 hours agoparentprevI've leaned into it: all application state is on ephemeral storage and its constantly replicated \"off-site\" to a NAS running minio. To accomplish this, I have restricted myself to SQLite as storage and use Litestream for replication. On start, Litestream reconstructs the last known state before the application starts. [Source](https://github.com/LukasKnuth/homeserver/blob/912cbc0111e44d...) It works very well for my workloads (user interaction driven web apps) but there are theoretical situations in which data loss can occurr. reply amluto 10 hours agorootparentYou need to store data somewhere. If you’re willing to have that location be off-site and to pay for remote storage and possibly egress, and you’re okay with your local installation not coming up if the off-site storage is inaccessible and with the latency involved in bringing your on-site data back, fine. Of course, if you really lean in to a complete lack of local persistent state and you configure your network or some other critical service like this, good luck recovering from an upgrade and complete loss of ephemeral state. reply lknuth 8 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I understand your second point. Yes, if the external replication target is unavailable, I can't bring my local service back online. Same goes for if the replication target becomes unavailable and I don't realize it, there is potential for a lot of data to be lost if the application restarts. For my personal usecase this is fine. I also have monitoring setup to look for just this case. It's a tradeoff between resilience and simplicity that works for some use cases - mine included. reply amluto 7 hours agorootparentMy second point is that, in a setup of any complexity, a black start is nontrivial. You have a network, with routes, DNS config, maybe VLANs, maybe a whole SDN. If that’s down because the machines running it are trying to pull their own configuration over the network, it won’t come back up. You can get pretty far into the weeds with situations like this. Facebook supposedly got locked out of their own datacenter due to a network outage preventing the access control system from accessing whatever service it needed to allow anyone to open the door. reply splix 6 hours agoparentprevI'd suggest to run it on top a virtualization environment, like Proxmox. That solves a lot of problems, and not just related to Talos. Basically, you split k8s and the resource management, networking, disks, etc, as well as getting backup, migration, etc. reply INTPenis 10 hours agoparentprevThis is worrying because I am just in the process of migrating old CentOS clusters to Talos and we need one additional disk other than the system disk. It's used for the host based ceph cluster. But if I read this correctly there shouldn't be an issue adding one blank disk to the Talos VM, the issue is only more granular disk and partitions management. reply vbezhenar 12 hours agoparentprevJust use PXE?

Much easier than dealing with a bunch of USB boot drives and keeping them up to date. reply Veraticus 16 hours agoprevWe use Talos really extensively in production. It’s been an amazing solution for our Kubernetes clusters. Highly recommended for a really smart, really directed Linux distro. reply splix 6 hours agoprevWe've been using it for a while, and I'm absolutely happy with the project. Before that, we had a Kubespray based setup. It's a bunch of Ansible script and it allows to make any custom setup, like absolutely anything as you in control of the machines. But the other side of this is that it's extremely easy to break everything. Which we did a couple of times. And so any upgrade is a risk of loosing the whole cluster, so we decided it must be run in VM with full backup before each upgrade. Another problem that it takes about an hour to apply a change, because Ansible has to apply all the scripts each time. Then we migrated to Talos, and it's a day and night. The initial setup took like an hour, including reading the docs and a tutorial. Easy to setup, easy to maintain, easy to upgrade (and it takes minutes). Note that we run the nodes as VMs in Proxmox, so the disk and network setup are outside of Talos scope, as well as backups, and it's actually simplifies everything. So it \"just works\" and we can focus on your app not the cluster setup. reply JustinGarrison 3 hours agoparentThanks for the feedback and happy to hear you like Talos! reply apexalpha 5 hours agoprevI think a word is missing from the front page: Talos improves security further by mounting the root filesystem as read-only and removing any host-level such as a shell and SSH.

If the OS running in the pod does not allow you to do that - during development - then that's severely limiting. reply vbezhenar 11 hours agorootparentTalos is OS running in the host. You can run in the pod whatever you need. Also you shouldn't really use pod OS to debug it. Kubernetes supports debug containers: you launch a separate container (presumably with convenient debug environment) and mounts selected container rootfs inside, so you can inspect it as needed. It also helps, when the target container does not work and you can't just exec into it. There's a recommendation to remove everything from the container that's not necessary for running a given program, that reduces attack surface. reply gotbeans 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can still exec yourself into the pods. No one said you cannot. There is no shell or ssh on the hosts for you to login to, but still if you absolutely must you can create a privileged container and mount /.

It is not immediately clear from the website. reply sierra1011 12 hours agorootparent\"Talos: Secure, immutable, and minimal Linux OS for running Kubernetes\" I guess we'll never know... But in truth it's for running on hosts. reply FooBarWidget 12 hours agorootparentprevSome customers of an internal Kubernetes platform complain that their pods keep getting evicted because their nodes keep running out of disk space. The platform's maintainers' first instinct was that customers' pods should not write to ephemeral storage, e.g., should not write to log files on the filesystem unless mounted from external storage. But that turns out not to be the case: customers' pods did not write anything to disk at all. So why were nodes running out of disk space? Prometheus metrics show which partitions use how much disk space but cannot go into more detail. The team wanted to inspect the node's filesystem to figure out what exactly is using so much disk space. The first thing they tried is to run a management pod that contains standard tools such as 'df' and that mounts the host's filesystem. Unfortunately the act of scheduling a pod on that node causes it to experience disk pressure, and so the management pod gets evicted. So, being dogmatic about \"the host should not have any tools installed\" is good and all, but how do you debug this scenario without tools on the host? We eventually figured it out. By logging into the host OS and using the shell tools there. reply sierra1011 12 hours agorootparentSounds a lot like the host OS is generic instead of container-focused, which could be part of the problem. What was the cause/solution? Images too big? reply FooBarWidget 2 hours agorootparentActually, no, the host OS was Amazon BottleRocket, a specifically container-focused OS. The cause was indeed images being too big. Images — not only the raw images, but also their extracted contents on the filesystem — count towards ephemeral storage too. In their case they can't even control the size of the images because those are supplied by a vendor. The solution was to increase the node's disk space. reply sierra1011 27 minutes agorootparentInteresting, I use Bottlerocket on my work clusters too. I think we had issues like this using some ridiculous data tool images that take up gigabytes, so we just upped the EBS size.

The former president escaped with a bullet wound to his ear in the attack, which happened early on Saturday evening as the former president was giving a speech to supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles (50 km) north of Pittsburgh. Trump assassination attempt latest The Republican challenger, who is due to receive his party's formal nomination in Wisconsin this week, has since said it was \"God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening\". Mr Trump was seen ducking to the ground as a series of shots rang out and people screamed in panic during the attack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:34 Hear what secret service said to Trump He was mobbed by Secret Service seeking to shield him and as he was bundled off stage to a waiting armoured vehicle with a bloodied ear, Mr Trump pumped his fist in the air in a show of defiance and shouted \"fight\" as the cheering audience chanted \"USA\". As well as one person in the crowd being killed, two people were critically injured after the gunman fired \"multiple shots\" from an \"elevated position\" from outside the rally venue, said the Secret Service. The FBI has named the attack - shot dead by security forces - as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who according to state records was a registered Republican. Footage at the scene showed a white-roofed factory building, about 150m from where Mr Trump was speaking, with a body and a semiautomatic rifle on top. Advertisement Image: Pic: Getty Image: Pic: AP Writing on his Truth Social platform, the 78-year-old wrote: \"Thank you to everyone for your thoughts and prayers yesterday, as it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening. \"We will fear not, but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of wickedness. \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families.

In an address to the nation he said: \"It's sick. Sick. \"We cannot allow for this to be happening.\" Trump assassination bid is chance for political reset James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky The first questions are all about the incident itself, of course - the perpetrator, the motivation and method. Not forgetting: how on earth could this have happened? It's scarcely believable for anyone who has attended a Trump event and witnessed the security firewall that separates the man from the masses. The agents charged with Donald Trump's protection, Secret Service or otherwise, face a grilling on a failure in the fundamentals of the job. Allowing a former and, possibly, future president to be caught in the cross-hairs of a sniper's bullet puts them in the firing line and they will have to account for actions that ended in fatality, albeit not of the prime target. In the wake of the shooting, one eyewitness told the media microphones he was surprised it hadn't happened before now. He's not alone in a country that feels the persistent undercurrent of political violence. Read the rest of James's analysis The Biden campaign said it was pausing all messaging to supporters and moving to pull all of its television ads as quickly as possible. Read more: 'Fundamental security failure' allowed attack, experts say Minute by minute - how the assassination attempt unfolded Many Republicans quickly sought to blame the violence on Mr Biden and his allies, arguing that attacks on Mr Trump as a threat to democracy had created a toxic environment.

When Trump claims he hasn't even read it, I don't think he's lying (do you actually think Trump has the attention span to read over 900 pages of thinktank waffle?). It is just a list of things they hope they'll be able to talk Trump (and his appointees) into doing if he is elected. And no doubt he'll probably do some of them. But others he'll only agree to in a watered down form, and yet others he'll reject entirely. Because he doesn't personally agree with a proposal. Or because he worries about negative political blowback (2026 midterms). Or because competing advisors/lobbyists/etc are telling him not to. And nobody really knows for sure what Trump will or won't agree to do, not even Trump himself – although we can guess (the most extreme proposals in the document are arguably the least likely to actually be implemented, its more moderate proposals have a greater chance of actually happening) Project 2025 is a manifesto of American ideological conservatism; Trump is not an ideological conservative. He's happy to use them to get ahead, but he has no qualms about throwing them under the metaphorical bus whenever he thinks it is in his political self-interest to do so. And they know they'll do this to him – he's done it to them before and he'll do it to them again – but they don't really have anywhere else to go. Case in point: the recent GOP platform, where Trump single-handedly ripped out a big chunk of the anti-abortion language and anti-marriage equality language – because he is convinced (not without good reason) that stuff is going to cost him with the swing voters he needs to win.

I agree he's probably going to do some of the things they are asking. Something like making it easier to fire federal bureaucrats who are trying to oppose his agenda from within – I can see why that would appeal to him. But other stuff in Project 2025 probably doesn't. Also, having very briefly skim-read Project 2025, much it just sounds like a return to the policies of the Trump I or Bush Jr administrations on various issues (e.g. reinstating various abortion-related funding bans which the Biden administration reversed).

Major relevant factors include a high degree of individualism, relatively high risk tolerance, relatively strong belief in property rights, etc. - all of which are coincident with a belief in and desire for public gun ownership. I look at the US and I see one of the richest, most successful, and most impactful countries in the world (and not through any sort of low-liquidity arbitrage like being a tax haven).

    "originLink": "https://nvidia.github.io/warp/",
    "originBody": "NVIDIA Warp Documentation# Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. Warp takes regular Python functions and JIT compiles them to efficient kernel code that can run on the CPU or GPU. Warp is designed for spatial computing and comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics, and geometry processing. In addition, Warp kernels are differentiable and can be used as part of machine-learning pipelines with frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX. Below are some examples of simulations implemented using Warp: Quickstart# The easiest way to install Warp is from PyPI: $ pip install warp-lang The binaries hosted on PyPI are currently built with the CUDA 11.8 runtime. Users requiring a newer CUDA runtime in Warp can build Warp from source or install wheels hosted on GitHub as described in Installing from GitHub Releases. Basic Example# An example first program that computes the lengths of random 3D vectors is given below: import warp as wp import numpy as np num_points = 1024 @wp.kernel def length(points: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3), lengths: wp.array(dtype=float)): # thread index tid = wp.tid() # compute distance of each point from origin lengths[tid] = wp.length(points[tid]) # allocate an array of 3d points points = wp.array(np.random.rand(num_points, 3), dtype=wp.vec3) lengths = wp.zeros(num_points, dtype=float) # launch kernel wp.launch(kernel=length, dim=len(points), inputs=[points, lengths]) print(lengths) Additional Examples# The warp/examples directory in the Github repository contains a number of scripts categorized under different subdirectories that show how to implement different simulation methods using the Warp API. Most examples will generate USD files containing time-sampled animations in the same directory as the example. Before running examples, users should ensure that the usd-core, matplotlib, and pyglet packages are installed using: pip install usd-core matplotlib pyglet Examples can be run from the command-line as follows: python -m warp.examples.. Most examples can be run on either the CPU or a CUDA-capable device, but a handful require a CUDA-capable device. These are marked at the top of the example script. USD files can be viewed or rendered inside NVIDIA Omniverse, Pixar’s UsdView, and Blender. Note that Preview in macOS is not recommended as it has limited support for time-sampled animations. Built-in unit tests can be run from the command-line as follows: python -m warp.tests examples/core# dem fluid graph capture marching cubes mesh nvdb raycast raymarch sph torch wave examples/fem# apic fluid convection diffusion diffusion 3d diffusion mixed elasticity navier stokes stokes transfer stokes examples/optim# bounce cloth throw diffray drone inverse kinematics spring cage trajectory walker examples/sim# cartpole cloth granular granular collision sdf jacobian ik quadruped rigid chain rigid contact rigid force rigid gyroscopic rigid soft contact soft body Omniverse# Omniverse extensions for Warp are available in the extension registry inside Omniverse Kit or USD Composer. The omni.warp.core extension installs Warp into the Omniverse Application’s Python environment, which allows users to import the module in their scripts and nodes. The omni.warp extension provides a collection of OmniGraph nodes and sample scenes demonstrating uses of Warp in OmniGraph. Enabling the omni.warp extension automatically enables the omni.warp.core extension. Please see the Omniverse Warp Documentation for more details on how to use Warp in Omniverse. Learn More# Please see the following resources for additional background on Warp: Product Page GTC 2022 Presentation GTC 2021 Presentation SIGGRAPH Asia 2021 Differentiable Simulation Course GTC 2024 Presentation The underlying technology in Warp has been used in a number of research projects at NVIDIA including the following publications: Accelerated Policy Learning with Parallel Differentiable Simulation - Xu, J., Makoviychuk, V., Narang, Y., Ramos, F., Matusik, W., Garg, A., & Macklin, M.

Krishna, Miles Macklin, Florian Golemo, Vikram Voleti, Linda Petrini, Martin Weiss, Breandan Considine et al. (2021) Support# Problems, questions, and feature requests can be opened on GitHub Issues. The Warp team also monitors the #warp channel on the public Omniverse Discord server, come chat to us! Versioning# Versions take the format X.Y.Z, similar to Python itself: Increments in X are reserved for major reworks of the project causing disruptive incompatibility (or reaching the 1.0 milestone). Increments in Y are for regular releases with a new set of features. Increments in Z are for bug fixes. In principle there are no new features. Can be omitted if 0 or not relevant. This is similar to Semantic Versioning but less strict around backward compatibility. Like with Python, some breaking changes can be present between minor versions if well documented and gradually introduced. Note that prior to 0.11.0 this schema was not strictly adhered to.

My boards and code live here: https://github.com/netik/rpi_gameshow reply bfdm 4 hours agoprevThis is really nice. Well done! I've had a jeopardy based toy project on the backburner for several years, with the north star goal of solving the problem I've had with every jeopardy game I've ever played: you need an Alex/host who knows the answer and can judge players right or wrong. This ability to buzz in, be wrong and then have another player respond is fairly crucial to real strategic play. I get this is for fun and not meant to be \"real\" jeopardy, but I wonder if you could add support for something like this by allowing a \"join as host\" option when using the QR code that would reveal the answer and not have a score.

All it does is pause the video on the laptop for 10 seconds when someone presses the button on their phone, and show their name. On the plus side it works for any YouTube/PeerTube/local-file video, on the minus side no score-keeping or even checking of the answer. https://github.com/remram44/video-buzzer I think we only used it once, years ago. reply hk1337 37 minutes agoprevThat's really cool. I always liked trying to do interactive applications like this. What's the story behind the name, \"Buzzinga\" aka Bazinga? reply PaulMest 5 hours agoprevVery cool! I built a no-code version of this for my friends' birthdays where all of the clues were about them (inside jokes, dumb bets, catch phrases, etc). I just printed out categories in a grid on a sheet of paper and had a bunch of questions listed out in OneNote on my phone and manually kept score. I didn't put penalties in place if somebody got it wrong to encourage people to participate vs just optimizing for score. \"Jonpardy\" and \"Joshpardy\" are two of our friend groups most cherished and repeatedly cited events from the past 10 years. I've dabbled with the idea of creating some real implementation of this. I most recently put together an @Midnight / After Midnight no-code game for a friend's bachelor party. The buzz-in mechanics and score-keeping are somewhat similar. Maybe you could repurpose your core logic for several different game show themes? reply Wolfmans55 5 hours agoparentYeah, I made a category for a game night with friends called “Who wrote this Facebook status in ‘09?”, which was very popular. Repurposing the logic for different game shows is definitely interesting. Although I’ve matured Buzzinga in the last seven months, there’s definitely still room to improve, but eventually I can see this transition! reply ddtaylor 5 hours agoprevVery fun! I can't wait to give it a run through when I finish some of the questions.

Obviously latency can be an issue, so my non-perfect B+ solution is to essentially calculate the round trip of the buzz, divide it by 2, and subtract it from the server time. client ------------ pingTime ------------> server client <----------- serverTime ----------- server roundTrip = pingTime + pongTime buzzTime = serverTime - (roundTrip / 2); The server time is always the source of truth since client times can vary. Not using NTP which could possibly be more accurate. reply demondemidi 1 hour agoprevWhen I was in high school in the mid 80s I was in the av club and we filmed things for local access cable.

    "title": "Building and scaling Notion's data lake",
    "originLink": "https://www.notion.so/de-de/blog/building-and-scaling-notions-data-lake",
    "originBody": "Alle Beiträge ← Alle Beiträge Veröffentlicht am 1. Juli 2024 in Technik Building and scaling Notion’s data lake Von XZ Tie, Nathan Louie, Thomas Chow, Darin Im, Abhishek Modi, Wendy Jiao Lesezeit 12 min Diesen Beitrag teilen In the past three years Notion’s data has expanded 10x due to user and content growth, with a doubling rate of 6-12 months. Managing this rapid growth while meeting the ever-increasing data demands of critical product and analytics use cases, especially our recent Notion AI features, meant building and scaling Notion’s data lake. Here’s how we did it. Notion’s data model and growth Everything you see in Notion—texts, images, headings, lists, database rows, pages, etc—despite differing front-end representations and behaviors, is modeled as a \"block\" entity in the back end and stored in the Postgres database with a consistent structure, schema, and associated metadata (learn more about Notion's data model). Everything in Notion is a block, and these blocks are made up of data. Lots and lots of data. All this block data has been doubling every 6 to 12 months, driven by user activity and content creation. At the start of 2021 we had more than 20 billion block rows in Postgres, and this figure has since grown to more than two hundred billion blocks—a data volume of hundreds of terabytes, even when compressed. To manage this data growth while enhancing the user experience, we’ve strategically expanded our database infrastructure from one Postgres instance to a more complex sharded architecture. We began in 2021 by horizontally sharding our Postgres database into 32 physical instances, each comprising 15 logical shards, and continued in 2023 by increasing the number of physical instances to 96, with five logical shards per instance. Thus we maintained a total of 480 logical shards while ensuring long-term scalable data management and retrieval capabilities. By 2021 Postgres comprised the core of our production infrastructure, handling everything from online user traffic to various offline data analytics and machine learning needs. As the demands on both online and offline data increased, we realized it was essential to build a dedicated data infrastructure to handle offline data without interfering with online traffic. Notion’s data warehouse architecture in 2021 In 2021, we initiated this dedicated data infrastructure with a simple ELT (Extract, Load, and Transform) pipeline that used the third-party tool Fivetran to ingest data from the Postgres WAL (Write Ahead Log) to Snowflake and set up 480 hourly-run connectors for the 480 shards to write to the same number of raw Snowflake tables. We then merged these tables into a single large table for analytics, reporting, and machine learning use cases. Scaling challenges As our Postgres data grew, we encountered several scaling challenges. Operability The overhead of monitoring and managing 480 Fivetran connectors, along with re-syncing them during Postgres re-sharding, upgrade, and maintenance periods, became extremely high, creating a significant on-call burden for team members. Speed, data freshness and cost Ingesting data to Snowflake became slower and more costly, primarily due to Notion's unique update-heavy workload. Notion users update existing blocks (texts, headings, titles, bullet lists, database rows, etc) much more often than they add new ones. This causes block data to be predominantly update-heavy—90% of Notion upserts are updates. Most data warehouses, including Snowflake, are optimized for insert-heavy workloads, which makes it increasingly challenging for them to ingest block data. Use case support Data transformation logic became more complex and heavy, surpassing the capabilities of the standard SQL interface offered by off-the-shelf data warehouses. One important use case is constructing denormalized views of Notion’s block data for key products (e.g., AI and Search). Permission data, for example, ensures that only the right people can read or change a block (this blog discusses Notion’s block permission model). But a block’s permission isn’t statically stored in the associated Postgres—it has to be constructed on the fly via expensive tree traversal computation. In the following example, block_1, block_2, and block_3 inherit permissions from their immediate parents (page_3 and page_2) and ancestors (page_1 and workspace_a). To build permission data for each of these blocks, we must traverse its ancestor tree all the way up to the root (workspace_a) in order to ensure completeness. With hundreds of billions of blocks whose ancestor depths ranged from a few to dozens, this kind of compute was very costly and would simply time out in Snowflake. Constructing permission data for each block requires traversing the entire ancestor tree. Because of these challenges, we started to explore building our data lake. Building and scaling Notion’s in-house data lake Here were our objectives for building an in-house data lake: Establish a data repository capable of storing both raw and processed data at scale. Enable fast, scalable, operable, and cost-efficient data ingestion and computation for any workload—especially Notion's update-heavy block data. Unlock AI, Search, and other product use cases that require denormalized data. However, while our data lake is a big step forward, it's important to clarify what it's not intended to do: Completely replace Snowflake. We’ll continue to benefit from Snowflake’s operational and ecosystem ease by using it for most other workloads, particularly those that are insert-heavy and don’t require large-scale denormalized tree traversal. Completely replace Fivetran. We’ll continue taking advantage of Fivetran’s effectiveness with non-update heavy tables, small dataset ingestion, and diverse third-party data sources and destinations. Support online use cases that require second-level or stricter latency. The Notion data lake will primarily focus on offline workloads that can tolerate minutes to hours of latency. Our data lake’s high-level design Since 2022 we’ve used the in-house data lake architecture shown below. We ingest incrementally updated data from Postgres to Kafka using Debezium CDC connectors, then use Apache Hudi, an open-source data processing and storage framework, to write these updates from Kafka to S3. With this raw data we can then do transformation, denormalization (e.g., tree traversal and permission data construction for each block), and enrichment, then store the processed data in S3 again or in downstream systems to serve analytics and reporting needs, as well as AI, Search, and other product requirements. Notion’s in-house data lake is built on Debezium CDC connector, Kafka, Hudi, Spark, and S3. Next we’ll describe and illustrate the design principles and decisions we arrived at after extensive research, discussion, and prototyping work. Design decision 1: Choosing a data repository and lake Our first decision was to use S3 as a data repository and lake to store all raw and processed data, and position data warehouse and other product-facing data stores such as ElasticSearch, Vector Database, Key-Value store, etc as its downstream. We made this decision for two reasons: It aligned with Notion’s AWS tech stack, e.g., our Postgres database is based on AWS RDS and its export-to-S3 feature (described in later sections) allows us to easily bootstrap tables in S3. S3 has proven its ability to store large amounts of data and support various data processing engines (like Spark) at low cost. By offloading heavy ingestion and compute workloads to S3 and only ingesting highly cleaned and business-critical data to Snowflake and product-facing data stores, we significantly improved data compute scalability and speed and reduced cost. Design decision 2: Choosing our processing engine We chose Spark as our main data processing engine because as an open-source framework, it could be rapidly set up and evaluated to verify that it met our data transformation needs. Spark has four key benefits: Spark’s wide range of built-in functions and UDFs (User Defined Functions) beyond SQL enable complex data processing logics like tree traversal and block data denormalization, as described above. It offers a user-friendly PySpark framework for most lighter use cases, and advanced Scala Spark for high-performance, heavy data processing. It processes large-scale data (e.g., billions of blocks and hundreds of terabytes) in a distributed manner, and exposes extensive configurations, which allows us to fine-tune our control over partitioning, data skewness, and resource allocation. It also enables us to break down complex jobs into smaller tasks and optimize resourcing for each task, which helps us achieve reasonable runtime without over-provisioning or wasting resources. Finally, Spark’s open-source nature offers cost-efficiency benefits. Design decision 3: Preference for incremental ingestion over snapshot dump After finalizing our data lake storage and processing engine, we explored solutions for ingesting Postgres data to S3. We wound up considering two approaches: incremental ingestion of changed data and periodic full snapshots of Postgres tables. In the end, based on performance and cost comparisons, we opted for a hybrid design: During normal operations, incrementally ingest and continuously apply changed Postgres data to S3. In rare cases, take a full Postgres snapshot once to bootstrap tables in S3. The incremental approach ensures fresher data at lower cost and with minimal delay (a few minutes to a couple hours, depending on table size). Taking a full snapshot and dumping to S3, by contrast, takes more than 10 hours and costs twice as much, so we do so infrequently, when bootstraping new tables in S3. Design decision 4: Streamlining incremental ingestion Kafka CDC Connector for Postgres → to → Kafka We chose the Kafka Debezium CDC (Change Data Capture) connector to publish incrementally changed Postgres data to Kafka, similar to Fivetran’s data ingestion method. We chose it together with Kafka for their scalability, ease of setup, and close integration with our existing infrastructure. Hudi for Kafka → to → S3 To ingest the incremental data from Kafka to S3, we considered three excellent data lake and ingestion solutions: Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and DataBricks Delta Lake. In the end we chose Hudi for its excellent performance with our update-heavy workload and its open-source nature and native integration with Debezium CDC messages. Iceberg and Delta Lake, on the other hand, weren’t optimized for our update-heavy workload when we considered them in 2022. Iceberg also lacked an out-of-box solution that understands Debezium messages; Delta Lake does have one, but it isn’t open source. We would have had to implement our own Debezium consumer if we’d gone with either of those solutions. Design decision 5: Ingest raw data before processing Finally, we decided to ingest raw Postgres data to S3 without on-the-fly processing in order to establish a single source of truth and simplify debugging across the entire data pipeline. Once raw data is in S3, we then do transformation, denormalization, enrichment, and other types of data processing. We store intermediate data in S3 again and only ingest highly cleaned, structured, and business-critical data to downstream systems for analytics, reporting, and product needs. Scaling and operating our data lake We experimented with many detailed setups in order to tackle the scalability challenges associated with Notion’s ever-increasing data volume. Here's what we tried and how it went: 1. CDC connector and Kafka setup We set up one Debezium CDC connector per Postgres host and deploy them in an AWS EKS cluster. Because of the maturity of Debezium and EKS management and Kafka's scalability, we’ve only had to upgrade the EKS and Kafka clusters a few times in the past two years. As of May 2024, it smoothly handles tens of MB/sec of Postgres row changes. We also configure one Kafka topic per Postgres table and let all connectors consuming from 480 shards write to the same topic for that table. This setup significantly reduced the complexity of maintaining 480 topics for each table and simplified downstream Hudi ingestion to S3, significantly reducing operational overhead. 2. Hudi setup We used Apache Hudi Deltastreamer, a Spark-based ingestion job, to consume Kafka messages and replicate the state of Postgres table in S3. After several rounds of performance tuning, we established a fast, scalable ingestion setup to ensure data freshness. This setup provides a delay of just a few minutes for most tables, and up to two hours for the largest one, the block table (see graphic below). We use the default COPY_ON_WRITE Hudi table type with UPSERT operation, which suits our update-heavy workload. To manage data more effectively and minimize write amplification (i.e., the number of files updated per batched ingestion run), we fine-tuned three configurations: Partition/shard data using the same Postgres shard scheme, i.e., the hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field: db_schema_source_partition config. This partitions the S3 dataset into 480 shards, from shard0001 to shard0480, making it more likely that a batch of incoming updates map to the same set of files from the same shard. Sort data based on the last updated time (event_lsn), i.e., the source-ordering-field: event_lsn config. This is based on our observation that more recent blocks are more likely to get updated, which allows us to prune files with only outdated blocks. Set the index type to be bloom filter, i.e., the hoodie.index.type: BLOOM config, to further optimize the workload. Hudi Deltastreamer setup for the block table. 3. Spark data processing setup For the majority of our data processing jobs we utilize PySpark, whose relatively low learning curve makes it accessible to many team members. For more complex jobs such as tree traversal and denormalization, we leverage Spark’s superior performance in several key areas: We benefit from the performance efficiency of the Scala Spark. We manage data more effectively by handling large and small shards separately (remember we kept the same 480 shards scheme in S3 to be consistent with Postgres); small shards have their entire data loaded into the Spark task container memory for fast processing, whereas large shards that exceed memory capacity are managed through disk reshuffling. We utilize multi-threading and parallel processing to speed up processing of 480 shards, allowing us to optimize runtime and efficiency. 4. Bootstrap setup Here's how we bootstrap new tables: We first set up Debezium Connector to ingest Postgres changes to Kafka. Starting from timestamp t, we kick off a AWS RDS-provided export-to-S3 job to save the latest snapshot of Postgres tables to S3. We then create a Spark job to read those data from S3 and write them to the Hudi table format. Finally, we ensure that all changes made during the snapshotting process are captured by setting up Deltastreamer to read from Kafka messages from t. This step is crucial for maintaining data completeness and integrity. Thanks to the scalability of Spark and Hudi, these three steps usually complete within 24 hours, allowing us to perform re-bootstrap with manageable time to accommodate new table asks and Postgres upgrade and re-sharding operations. The payoff: less money, more time, stronger infrastructure for AI We started developing our data lake infrastructure in the spring of 2022 and completed it by that fall. Due to the infra's inherently scalable nature, we were able to continually optimize and expand the Debezium EKS clusters, Kafka clusters, Deltastreamer, and Spark job to keep up with Notion's 6-to-12 month data doubling rate without significant overhauls. The payoff was significant: Moving several large, crucial Postgres datasets (some of them tens of TB large) to data lake gave us a net savings of over a million dollars for 2022 and proportionally higher savings in 2023 and 2024. For these datasets, the end-to-end ingestion time from Postgres to S3 and Snowflake decreased from more than a day to a few minutes for small tables and up to a couple of hours for large ones. Re-syncs, when necessary, can be completed within 24 hours without overloading live databases. Most importantly, the changeover unlocked massive data storage, compute, and freshness savings from a variety of analytics and product asks, enabling the successful rollout of Notion AI features in 2023 and 2024. Stay tuned for a detailed post on our Search and AI Embedding RAG Infra built on top of the data lake! We’d like to thank OneHouse and the Hudi open source community for their tremendous and timely support. Great open source support was crucial to our ability to spin up the data lake in just a few months. As our needs grow and diversify, we continue to enhance our data lake by building automated and self-service frameworks to empower more engineers to manage and develop product use cases based on the data.

What does a backing data lake afford a Notion user that can’t be done in a similar product, like Obsidian? reply bastawhiz 3 hours agoparentThe whole point of a data warehouse is that you can rapidly query a huge amount of data with ad hoc queries. When your data is in Postgres, running an arbitrary query might take hours or days (or longer). Postgres does very poorly for queries that read huge amounts of data when there's no preexisting index (and you're not going to be building one-off indexes for ad hoc queries—that defeats the point). A data warehouse is slower for basic queries but substantially faster for queries that run against terabytes or petabytes of data.

Github workflows has downsides and this solution does solve them (and introduces its own). But what I am not getting is why this approach is better than the email workflow. The downsides of email workflow that the author mentioned are (1) Having to setup mailing list, (2) setting the mail client, (3) friction in submitting a patch, which I assume the author is referring to setting git-send, (4) email is limited such as not being able to modify it, not being able to download the patch, and limitation around the plain-text, and the author doesn't hint into what limitation he is thinking of. These are downsides of email workflow, and I do not think they are significant (except for 1, which could be done though a person's email address if the project is small). But the SSH workflow replaces them with similar issues such as (1) setting SSH server and maintaining it and the cost associated with it, (2) clients will need to maintain their identities though SSH, (4) replace email-replies with code comments (email-replies is better as you can do more than just text). (3) Here SSH workflow is better as it requires no work, but configuring git-send is a very small and usually 1-time change. In most cases, the only mail client requirement is to be able to write plain text. Virtually all mail clients can do this with a simple checkbox. Only the maintainer will need ability to `git am' the patch from an email message, and this is indeed a downside of email workflow. All in all, nothing wrong with more options, and I am sure SSH meets certain needs, but to me email-workflow and SSH compete in the same category and email-workflow is superior. reply beshrkayali 3 hours agoprevThere's definitely something very interesting here. Keeping the user in their editor for code reviews is pretty nice indeed, but I think that with larger projects and bigger changes, it's going to be way more difficult to skim through what has changed where, which helps me identify how to start reviewing. There would have to be an easier way to see what changed where quickly without having to mess up my working tree (which is almost always dirty with something) and having to stash or switch back and forth between branches for reviewing is going to be painful. Sometimes I have small comments or questions, I'd like to be able to do that without having to download the entire patch. Also, I'm not sure if I missed something, but does every review get applied as a commit by itself that I (as repo owner) would have to squash? This feels like a chore by itself. I have relied on github for previous work but for the last couple of years I've been primarily using Gerrit for my job, and although there are some drawbacks, I absolutely love its workflow. Github workflow is not free from drawbacks either, and if I'm asked now I absolutely prefer Gerrit's to Github's. Gerrit uses Git references in a unique way to facilitate code reviews and patches (which consist of one or more patchsets). I rarely use branches now except for extremely long-lived experiments, or for local temp purposes. A patch gets merged as a single commit no matter how many rounds of patchsets the submitter adds and reviews they get, and when needed I can quickly download the patch at any patchset to a different branch and then delete it. reply qudat 39 minutes agoparent> There would have to be an easier way to see what changed where quickly without having to mess up my working tree (which is almost always dirty with something) and having to stash or switch back and forth between branches for reviewing is going to be painful. Sometimes I have small comments or questions, I'd like to be able to do that without having to download the entire patch. I love this feedback and totally agree with you. Pulling a PR down and applying to review is great until you need to reference what's in main and have to ping-pong between them. At the end of the day, `git-pr` supports pushing and pull patchsets and we do have ideas around how a reviewer could review a patch request without applying it locally for something lighter-weight. Something like editing a patchset directly (with comments) and uploading that. I think I need to play around with Gerrit. When originally developing this idea, I looked at Gerrit but didn't actually play around with it. Someone else mentioned this already but I do want to experiment with revisions and supporting `git range-diff` workflows which I think could provide better support for larger reviews. reply e3bc54b2 28 minutes agorootparentGerrit is the gold standard of code reviews and I'll die on that hill. I've heard many a good things about phabricator too, but it requires lot of special tooling while gerrit just uses plain old git semantics. That said, I live git-pr so far. I have a forgejo instance and I like it for what it provides, but without federation, external contributors aren't able to contribute. If git-pr can be made to work with forgejo, I'll just go for it (self hosted, of course). reply zeotroph 1 hour agoprevHow do you envision pushing/reviewing a branch of 3 cleanly separated commits (say: write failing test, fix code, refactor) into a repo with a fast-forward/no-merge policy? The end result should of course be 3 commits, but review history should not be lost. 1) push 3 commits (author) 2) push 3 commits + 1 review commit (reviewer) or even 2a), + 3 interleaved review commits, might be needed if the final refactor removes something. then 3a) force-push 3 commits with the review comments applied (you mentioned --force is supported) 3b) or push 3 + 1 + (worst case 3) fixup commits, then a squash later? If 3a), does pico have the concept of patchsets like gerrit, so the state 2) can be retrieved later? PS: ... or even 2c, if the line I am commenting on is removed in patch 2 I would need to push a whole \"review tree\" (or fix conflicts in b and c): a -- b -- c -- review-c \\ \\ \\ `-review-b `- review-a reply qudat 28 minutes agoparentRight now, when force pushing, we preserve event logs for every server mutation, but the review themselves are lost. We do see this as a problem and are thinking about ways to address it. We do support the idea of a patchset (that's what the patch request managed). Right now we only support a single patchset for a patch request, but we are leaning toward introducing patch revisions where both contrib and owner submit entire versions of the patchset. This could provide better tracability since reviews would be in a separate patchset \"channel\" and not lost to force pushing. We also plan on supporting a patch request \"cover letter\" which includes all the events and comments during review. This cover letter is just an empty patch which could be `git am --empty=keep` or `git am --empty=drop` depending on preference. reply Daviey 6 hours agoprevCan you expand a bit more why this workflow (send patch over ssh, and rss feeds for owner), is better than either email workflow or using a centralised service with Pull Requests. reply qudat 3 hours agoparentSure. Pull Requests tend to force users into collaborating in a web view. Further, they require a collaborator to: - have an account on the platform - fork the repo - pull repo - create a branch - make the change - push to forked repo - click a button in the UI to create the PR With `git-pr` it can be this simple: - pull repo - make the change - submit pr with a single command `git format-patchssh host pr create x` If you've ever used the email workflow I don't think I need to explain why it sucks. reply pkal 2 hours agorootparentThis seems to come very close to recognising that if someone without permissions pushes something to a repository, it should be convered into a PR. > If you've ever used the email workflow I don't think I need to explain why it sucks.

On the reciving end you can respond inline to the patch, in the compfort of your email client, without having to use a browser.

I think it only gets harder when you want to do inline comments.

I used Phabricator extensively and in practice it is basically the same as Gitlab and GitHub and everyone else. You just say `arc diff` instead of `git push`. Phabricator was pretty nice overall I would say. The bug tracker in particular was good. I have to use Jira now and it's night and day. The big flaw was there was essentially no CI support. That and the fact it was written in PHP, which you'd think wouldn't matter, but I did end up being forced to learn some PHP to fix Phabricator bugs and write custom linters. Now we're using Gitlab which is also decent except it's written in Ruby which if anything is worse than PHP! Absolutely unreadable code base. I can't fix anything. (Except in gitlab-runner which is written in Go - I've contributed several fixes & features there.) reply lifeisstillgood 8 hours agoprevI like the basic philosophy that everything should be inside the code (yes lots of great collaboration and review tools out there with great browser based diffing- it’s just I am thirty years of reading code and writing code in a tool and I kinda get used to the code in the tool reply pushfoo 7 hours agoparentI agree for smaller projects, especially personal ones. For larger projects, approaches like GitHub's web client + terminal interface might be the next best thing since grepping doesn't scale well. For better or worse, GitHub branding also helps make their specific terminal tool an easier sell in large org environments. reply xelamonster 4 hours agorootparentHeh, well GitHub's search doesn't exactly scale well either. They _still_ only index the main branch, so if you want to find anything under active development or on an old tag version you're out of luck, clone + grep is the only way. reply lifeisstillgood 2 hours agorootparentGrepping for something “I am sure it was on a development branch somewhere” is always painful.

We have an ACL system for interacting with PRs and plan to expand it. reply EPWN3D 3 hours agoprevNifty, but it seems like this would lose commit message content and history entirely during the course of the review since you have to submit a single patch that gets applied, rather than publishing commits to a branch that gets merged. Am I understanding correctly? reply qudat 3 hours agoparentNot quite. We have adapted the `git format-patchgit send-email` flow to support editing the patchset. You can add, remove, even `--force` replace all patches within a patch request. The goal is to provide the flexibility of a pull request with the simplicity of generating patches. At the end of the day, the maintainer of the repo has to load the patchset locally, apply it, fix it up, then push to upstream. They have full control here. reply beepbooptheory 3 hours agoparentprevGithub also squashes the commits of a PR before it merges/rebases it onto a branch though. reply maxicarlos08 3 hours agorootparentNot necessarily, there are different ways of merging a PR in github reply djha-skin 5 hours agoprevI recently switched to neomutt and offlineimap/isync as my email client. I tried really hard after that to get a setup going so that I could accept git patches mailing list wise. I had to figure out how to set up a keyboard macro with just the right incantation[1] of b4[2]. I realized accepting patches meant my friends would also have to learn (neo)mutt if I wanted them to accept mine. It was really difficult. I can't imagine asking my friends to do that and collaborating with them. (I still like mutt though and still use it as my main client.) By the way, good luck getting that set up to work on Windows, which a large population of developers use because of their work laptops (or because they simply prefer the interface!). I made a script[3] that makes it easy to accept patches using an fzf interface, as a sort of reply to git-send-email[4]. I made sure to get it to work on Windows as well. I kind of think I might like this better. My script only involves some setup of two other third-party tools to accept a patch, but this feels a little cleaner. 1: https://git.sr.ht/~skin/dotfiles/tree/main/item/dot-muttrc#L... 2: https://github.com/mricon/b4 3: https://git.sr.ht/~skin/git-receive-mail/ 4: https://git-send-email.io/ reply tristan957 4 hours agoparentWhy would a collaborator have to learn your email client? reply hakre 1 hour agorootparentMessaging is very simple, but made hard so that the benefit is not on your side. Business opportunities, yay! reply djha-skin 4 hours agorootparentprevThey would need to learn a email client. The patch is in their email inbox and they don't have an easy way of applying it to their git Repository. Aerc or Mutt is necessary to accept patches easily usually, but then you have to learn those tools. reply worthless-trash 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you just copy paste into most email clients they somehow screw up the patch. reply elric 5 hours agoprevWould be even nicer if the command could be simplified (perhaps using a git alias) so that users don't have to go through the hassle of piping through ssh by hand. reply bruh2 7 hours agoprevThis is amazing! I found the text a bit too reference-y, as in giving too much theoretical background, while what I'm actually looking for is workflow breakdown. The demo video at the top of the page[1] demonstrates it beautifully and I recommend you go give it a watch. reply rakoo 6 hours agoparentThe details of a given patch give some info about the workflow reply aseipp 5 hours agoprevThis looks kind of small and homely and is obviously designed to appeal to a certain niche, which is nice. But the problem with a lot of \"alternative code hosting\" tools like this, IMO, is that they aren't actually that good for code review. This really dulls their appeal. What's the point of setting all this up if I don't read the patches? If you are only accepting 1 patch a year, then the reality is anything will work. Email, uploading .patch files to a bug tracker, GitHub, whatever. But if you're doing review and managing a dozen active patch sets at once with people who are asynchronous to you, then you need something better than that. Let's say 5-10 active contributors. That's where projects actually tend to struggle. There's this book called \"Rethinking UI\" and one of the first things it talks about is to write down features for your system, because the user interface comes from features. You can't design the UI without laying out a list of features. What features do I need in a code review tool? The two most important ones IMO are: 1. Code review is iterative, so a good feature is being able to see the history of a change as it is iterated on. 2. It's normal to have many patches in flight (your own + others). So, it's very useful to be able to quickly find things in a particular state: you need to review it (patch from someone else), you need to update it (patch you wrote and that got reviewed), it needs to be merged. Extra: 3. It should be easy to safely integrate a change when it's ready. Most tools are very bad at these core ideas: - Almost no actual mainstream review tools, or modern pop-up clones, ever include \"git range-diff\" in their repertoire of tools. range-diff is essential for many projects to do iterative review, and tools like Linux's b4 automate them. I won't include it all here, but I wrote about this review style elsewhere: https://gist.github.com/thoughtpolice/9c45287550a56b2047c631... - Most tools fall apart at \"What state is this in.\" For instance, in GitHub it's impossible to tell what state anything is in, except \"Can be merged\" or \"Cannot be merged.\" For instance, do I need to do another review on this PR after I did one before, and a coworker did one too? I have to go and look to see if everything was addressed properly. Tools like Gerrit have a more granular concept called \"The Attention Set\" which formalizes the concept of \"Do I need to do something?\" because it shows you when you need to take an action, like re-review or merge a patch. git-pr doesn't really seem to make those core problems any easier. Your approach sort of sidesteps these, these because you're expected to apply code manually and view it in your own editor. You could range-diff on your own. Part of the argument here goes back to the argument that best thing to do is sit in your editor -- but with a good review tool, you can do lots of review purely from your tool with no editor involved! I did tons of code review with Gerrit every day without ever opening my editor for 99% of it. A semi-related thing some people say is \"Well, in the Linux kernel style you can just send a pull request through any medium\", while GitHub and these other tools use a specific interface. The problem is you still need state to track the state of the work. That's required (it's one of my features!), notably so you can look at the change evolution and see if it's ready to merge. If I tell you \"Please merge my branch from https://example.com/foo.git with tag xyz-123\" that's technically a \"pull request\" like you would send to Linus, but understanding the actual state that PR is in is impossible without a lot of extra knowledge that a third party tool formalizes (even if poorly.) b4, the Linux kernel patch series tool, has a ton of stuff for things like this like digging up the right email threads to do diffs between, showing the cover letter, etc. And in the \"How do Patch Requests work?\" section, this sort of shows exactly the problem with this approach. I don't want to manually apply patches and run commands to merge it and push manually! I have 10 other patches to read after this one! Integrating things is why my tool is there! Why are steps 13 and 14 even necessary, for instance? Gerrit does all 3 of the above properly and is a very, very powerful and productive tool when you get used to it. Your approach does have a conceptual advantage which is that it focuses on the patch and not the \"branch\" as the unit of work. This is smart. So, if you keep going down this road and follow it to its logical conclusion, I think you'll tread some familiar ground. But I think realistically, you need to track actual state a patch is in, so that you can do things like range-diff it -- that would make the appeal of \"Just write comments in the code\" or whatever much higher because at least you can see when those comments get handled. You'll want to think about concepts like \"Change IDs\" as Gerrit calls them. Etc. BTW, Gerrit does all if this, it uses this 'Git notes' approach you briefly mention, and it stores all its content in a Git repo too, no extra database. The web UI has tons of affordances, and everything you do in the web UI is just a commit in the underlying repo. And you can interact with Gerrit entirely over SSH with pubkeys if you want; it looks like running normal commands e.g. `ssh austin@gerrit.foo.com gerrit review ...` -- in theory you could write a whole TUI. I strongly suggest spending some time with it, if you haven't. reply qudat 3 hours agoparentPico creator here. Thanks so much for your perspective, it's actually kind of hard to find users that live outside the pull request workflow. I think you are absolutely right about scaling issues. We have been thinking about range-diff and how it could work in our PR format. I'm going to read your thorough gist and ponder on what we can learn from it to improve our project. Thanks! reply IshKebab 7 hours agoprev> Github is bringing the IDE to the browser in order to support their workflow, we want to flip that idea on its head by making code reviews a first-class citizen inside your local development environment. What like this? https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.v... I'm all for standardising the pull request process but their suggested workflow sounds way worse than what we have now. Given how dominant Github is I seriously doubt anyone except the nerdiest nerds will use this. IMO if anyone is going to solve this it's going to have to happen inside Git, which I can't see happening. reply qudat 6 hours agoparentI think that's a fair observation. We don't expect massive companies to use this tool. Even within GitHub many companies are feeling its PR review feature-set lacking, especially for massive, long-standing code changes (just look at all the companies productizing code reviews). Our target demographic is the self-hosted hacker enthusiast. If you want a full-blown pull request workflow in the browser, this will never be that. However, there's a large demo of users that want a simple self-hosted solution that doesn't require a bunch of infra to manage. If you want to self-host a git collaboration tool you basically need to bootup gitea-scale services or be relegated to `git send-email`. The sweet spot for `git-pr` is right in-between those two tools. All you need is a tiny VM and a golang binary and you have a code review tool that is leveraging utilities you already have installed: git, ssh, and an editor. End users do not need to create an account, install any clients locally, and all user personas and workflows can be accomplished in the browser. reply IshKebab 6 hours agorootparent> you basically need to bootup gitea-scale services Is that actually difficult though? I was always under the impression that Gogs/Gitea were pretty easy to run because they're also written in Go. I just checked Gogs and it looks like it has exactly the same dependencies as Git-PR (Git and and SSH server). It would definitely be cool if Gogs/Gitea/Gitlab/Sourcehut standardised a PR API, but... like properly. reply g-b-r 5 hours agoprevInteresting, unfortunately format-patch does not support merge commits though. reply cess11 6 hours agoprevNot sure what I get from this that I won't from Gitea, and that doesn't need any adaptations to interfaces and if I want I get some basic project tracking tools and so on. reply qudat 6 hours agoparentWe are thinking about basic issue tracking, still in the \"idea\" status. reply michael-ax 7 hours agoprevwow, ty, this is brilliant! reply quectophoton 5 hours agoprevGitHub's greatest win has been convincing everyone that \"pull request\" means having a web interface for code review as well (conflating sharing code with reviewing it) and can only be done by creating accounts in websites; and that patch-based workflows can only be done through email. They even convinced people that repository clones are called \"forks\" when they have a web interface but not when they're local. I like that this project is trying to remove those misconceptions. Of course if the contributor already has their own publicly available repository, then they can send you a pull request through HackerNews if they want. Hey I made some performance improvements, they are at https://example.com/git-pr.git on branch `improvements`. That was a pull request. You can check out changes with `git pull https://example.com/git-pr.git improvements` and review them. I've also done ad-hoc patches through Slack, using `git diff` and `git apply` but the idea is the same. And yes I've also done stuff like this but with just `git push` instead of `git format-patchssh` (you want to look at pre-receive hook) messing around with friends on IRC.

Or, worse (IMHO) when they created the fork to house a patch - sometimes a meaningful feature, bugfix, or security fix - and then left it because the submission process was too onerous to bother. Onerous can also include never getting the PR reviewed, too, which is far more damaging (IMHO) because it disincentivizes future contributions, too I actually would love an \"implied PR\" view of the forks which would enable quickly filtering out the -0,+0 \"shallow forks\" from the -50,+2000 \"oh, that's likely doing something interesting\" ones, provided it has the sane ?w=0 to hide forks that felt it necessary to push up simple reformatting changes reply pindab0ter 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat would the alternative be, as you can't just edit someone else's repo?

The SSH daemon could create an isolated environment (e.g. QEMU, FreeBSD jail, etc) that contains a copy of the repository, and run the commands in there. Obviously this could also check SSH keys and the requested git commands before doing anything at all. It would probably be like what Sourcehut does[1] for letting you SSH into build VMs, but instead of a build it's a push. And they already do some logic during a push[2], so their code for those two places is probably a good place to look for how to implement this kind of thing.

They build special mechanisms to provide access control for sub namespaces, which sound a lot like \"forks\". Also i have no clue on their backend (iirc this info is researchable tho), but i wouldn't be surprised if functionally that is exactly how they do it anyway. It's all content addressed, i doubt they pay 2x the storage anytime you fork a repo right? reply saurik 4 hours agorootparentThe big difference is how it is organized to the users viewing it. My GitHub account is littered with old forks of repositories I created just to submit one line patches; and despite the pull request to a repository in some sense being data relating to the history of that project -- certainly the discussion is all organized under that project -- if the original person actually removes fork to garbage collect their namespace the commits referenced in that pull request just disappear. Meanwhile, despite people now using the word \"fork\" for this purpose due to GitHub, there is actual value in being able to search for actual forks of a project--things that people are choosing to publicly distribute and maybe maintain themselves--rather than seeing a thousand repositories which exist only for the purpose of contributing a single patch (or, though this is another topic, people making the metaphorical equivalent of a \"backup copy\" within the strange set of semantics and ownership that is GitHub). reply jagged-chisel 4 hours agorootparentprev> … git push directly to the repository Then we have a security problem or two. reply commodoreboxer 3 hours agorootparentYou cut off the important part: > in a separate branch namespace So not really. It's a special branch path that only exists for opening PRs, and doesn't do anything other than opening a PR. Yes, they share an object space, but so do forks in the first place, so any security issues with this flow are the same ones in the fork-PR flow. You can check out this which covers the whole flow: https://git-repo.info/en/2020/03/agit-flow-and-git-repo/ Or for a simpler overview, look at Gitea/Forgejo's implementation: https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/ reply mlhpdx 3 hours agorootparentIt's still a security problem. If you put an unlocked outside door on your house and rely on the interior doors to be locked, we'd agree that's not safe, right?

Folks with accounts \"littered with old forks created to make PRs\" may not have that kind of attentiveness. reply commodoreboxer 2 hours agorootparentI don't understand the analogy.

I don’t disagree with your point, and find pico.sh super interesting - but web is a much lower bar than ssh. reply koolala 3 hours agorootparentUnless... you use the Web to ssh! reply quectophoton 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah that part was mostly because people tend to think in terms of \"pull request, therefore web\" or \"email, therefore messing around with weird configs and stuff\". Tell someone that they can use Discord instead of email and they're probably like \"you can do that?!\". It's the same as when people say \"GitHub\" when they mean \"Git\"; or when they ask for your GitHub[1] to read some code. It's understood what they're trying to say, but thinking that \"GitHub\" is the same as \"Git\" causes unnecessary bias in thoughts. Using a different ecosystem as example, you can see this happening with ActivityPub implementations being biased towards Twitter-like usage thanks to Mastodon (where here ActivityPub would be equivalent to Git, and Mastodon equivalent to GitHub). But thankfully there's people who know they shouldn't be conflated, and are slowly bringing us collaboration between Git repositories through ActivityPub, starting with a web implementation (because as you say it has the lower barrier to entry). This should open more doors to more creative \"bridges\" that integrate with this ActivityPub flow. A more clear bias you see everywhere is that Git forges tend to just copy GitHub's flat URL structure of \"username/reponame\". It's rare to find something that does not have a flat structure like that (e.g. \"username/hackernews/repo-for-that-thread\") (yes I'm keeping \"username\" in the URL on purpose but it doesn't need to be there). Don't get me wrong, I like to organize things relatively flat most of the time, but I really appreciate a nested structure when I mirror thirdparty repositories (e.g. \"example.com/mirrors/github.com/username/reponame\"). So yeah, I like that from time to time we're getting projects like this that try to improve git collaboration and start from a point of view different than mimicking GitHub on everything. [1]: I've noticed when people ask for repos to read code they tend to ask for a GitHub link, but it's understood that a link to some Codeberg/Gitea/cgit/stagit instance also works. reply tpoacher 4 hours agoprev [–] meanwhile the equivalent process in svn is simply \"svn copy\" followed by \"set permissions\". i feel like branch permissions in bare git repos should be a thing already.

    "title": "Writing a BIOS bootloader for 64-bit mode from scratch",
    "originLink": "https://thasso.xyz/2024/07/13/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html",
    "originBody": "People say there are things that are complex and there are things that are just complicated. Complexity is considered interesting, complicatedness is considered harmful. The process of setting up an x86_64 CPU is mostly complicated. I’ll describe one way to go from a boot sector loaded by the BIOS with the CPU in 16-bit real mode to the CPU set up in 64-bit long mode. The setup is pretty bare-bones and there’s tons more to do. To follow along, you need the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, an assembler (I used nasm), and QEMU. If you don’t have an x86_64 CPU, you should still be able to run everything I describe by emulating an x86 CPU in QEMU. I assume you know x86 assembly and the syntax that nasm uses. I like the nasm tutorial by Ray Toal for getting started. I was surprised by how readable some of the Intel manual is. The initial chapters in volume 1 do a really good job at providing an overview of the system and explaining the terms used throughout the other volumes. But volume 3: System Programming Guide is most relevant to this discussion. There is an overview of all the operating modes in volume 3, section 2.2 Modes of Operation. The path we’re taking is highlighted in red. For everything up to 32-bit mode, take a look at “Writing a Simple Operating System – from Scratch”. It’s unfinished but still very good. Starting Point: BIOS After a reset, the x86 CPU is in “real mode”. That mode has a default operand size of 16 bits. You get a 20-bit address space and thus the ability to address 1MB of memory by using segmentation. Real mode is pretty much a backward compatibility mode for the Intel 8086 chip from 1978. After the BIOS the first code that runs is that in the boot sector. The BIOS searches the system for a disk where the first sector ends in the magic number 0xaa55 (i.e., the byte 0x55 followed by the byte 0xaa). It loads that “boot sector” to memory at address 0x7c00. So the BIOS gives us 512 bytes to work with. We need to use these bytes in order to bootstrap the rest of the bootloader. One can fit a surprising amount of stuff in 512 bytes, but it’s easiest to just load some more data from disk first. Fortunately, routines defined by the BIOS remain available to us as long as we’re in real mode. Boot Sector Setup Let’s set up a simple boot sector. It will just print a message to the screen using BIOS routines and then hang. This way, we know that the tooling works. This is the assembly we need: ;; src/boot_sector.s section .boot_sector global __start [bits 16] __start: mov bx, hello_msg call print_string end: hlt jmp end ;; Uses the BIOS to print a null-termianted string. The address of the ;; string is found in the bx register. print_string: pusha mov ah, 0x0e ; BIOS \"display character\" function print_string_loop: cmp byte [bx], 0 je print_string_return mov al, [bx] int 0x10 ; BIOS video services inc bx jmp print_string_loop print_string_return: popa ret hello_msg: db \"Hello, world!\", 0 Plus this Makefile: # Makefile .PHONY: all clean boot NASM := nasm -f elf64 BUILD_DIR := build SRC_DIR := src SRC := $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/*.s) OBJS := $(patsubst $(SRC_DIR)/%.s, $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o, $(SRC)) BOOT_IMAGE := $(BUILD_DIR)/boot_image all: $(BOOT_IMAGE) boot: $(BOOT_IMAGE)qemu-system-x86_64 -no-reboot -drive file=$ boot_sector .bootsign (0x7c00 + 510) : { BYTE(0x55) BYTE(0xaa) } > boot_sector } Running make boot should result in a QEMU window and the “Hello, World!” message should be displayed. Stage 1 – Loading Stage 2 From Disk We can split the bootloader into two stages. Stage 1 is the code in the boot sector. It is everything that the BIOS loads for us. The sole purpose of stage 1 is to load stage 2 into memory. Stage 1 does this by using BIOS-provided routines to load stage 2 into memory. In stage 2, we’ll switch from 16-bit real mode to 32-bit protected mode. In protected mode, we can’t use BIOS routines anymore. Without BIOS routines, loading sectors from a disk would become much more involved. So we’ll load a number of sectors from disk into memory and hope for the best. Of course, this is an unsafe technique, but it works for now. This is how one can access the disk using BIOS. There’s an osdev.org page on this. ;; src/boot_sector.s ;; ... __start: ;; ... mov si, disk_address_packet mov ah, 0x42 ; BIOS \"extended read\" function mov dl, 0x80 ; Drive number int 0x13 ; BIOS disk services jc error_reading_disk ignore_disk_read_error: SND_STAGE_ADDR equ (BOOT_LOAD_ADDR + SECTOR_SIZE) jmp 0:SND_STAGE_ADDR error_reading_disk: ;; We accept reading fewer sectors than requested cmp word [dap_sectors_num], READ_SECTORS_NUM jle ignore_disk_read_error mov bx, error_reading_disk_msg call print_string end: ;; ...

The Makefile remains unchanged. ;; src/stage2.s section .stage2 [bits 16] mov bx, stage2_msg call print_string end: hlt jmp end print_string: ;; ... stage2_msg: db \"Hello from stage 2\", 13, 10, 0 I just copied the print_string function so we can test if the jump works. Because this specific function only works with BIOS in real mode, it won’t be of any use to stage 2 once we have switched to protected mode. Finally the linker script: # linker.ld MEMORY { boot_sector (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x7c00, LENGTH = 512 stage2 (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x7e00, LENGTH = 32768 # 512 * 64 } ENTRY(__start) SECTIONS { .boot_sector : { *(.boot_sector); } > boot_sector .bootsign (0x7c00 + 510) : { BYTE(0x55) BYTE(0xaa) } > boot_sector .stage2 : { *(.stage2); } > stage2 } 32-bit Protected Mode Next, we’ll switch the CPU from real mode (16-bit) to protected mode (32-bit). In protected mode, segmentation is used by default to implement memory protection. Before switching to protected mode, you need to define a Global Descriptor Table (GDT) that contains segment descriptors for all the segments you want to define. Usually, paging is used in favor of segmentation. In fact, in 64-bit long mode, you need to use paging. But for the initial switch to protected mode, segmentation is required. The Intel manual describes the “flat model” as a very simple segmentation model that can be implemented in the GDT. The “flat model” comprises a code segment and a data segment. Both of these segments are mapped to the entire linear address space (their base addresses and limits are identical). Using the simplest of all models is fine, since we just want to get to long mode and abandon segmentation in favor of paging. The GDT is defined as a contiguous structure in memory. You fill a chunk of memory with the right data and give the CPU the address and the length of the memory chunk. The format of the GDT structure is described in the Intel manual. From section “3.4.5 Segment Descriptors”: The GDT is just an array of segment descriptors with a “null descriptor” at the start that’s used to catch invalid translations. The fields in the segment descriptor are described in detail in section “3.4.5 Segment Descriptors” of volume 3 of the Intel manual. We define the GDT like this: ;; include/gdt32.s ;; Base address of GDT should be aligned on an eight-byte boundary align 8 gdt32_start: ;; 8-byte null descriptor (index 0). ;; Used to catch translations with a null selector. dd 0x0 dd 0x0 gdt32_code_segment: ;; 8-byte code segment descriptor (index 1). ;; First 16 bits of segment limit dw 0xffff ;; First 24 bits of segment base address dw 0x0000 db 0x00 ;; 0-3: segment type that specifies an execute/read code segment ;; 4: descriptor type flag indicating that this is a code/data segment ;; 5-6: Descriptor privilege level 0 (most privileged) ;; 7: Segment present flag set indicating that the segment is present db 10011010b ;; 0-3: last 4 bits of segment limit ;; 4: unused (available for use by system software) ;; 5: 64-bit code segment flag indicates that the segment doesn't contain 64-bit code ;; 6: default operation size of 32 bits ;; 7: granularity of 4 kilobyte units db 11001111b ;; Last 8 bits of segment base address db 0x00 gdt32_data_segment: ;; Only differences are explained ... dw 0xffff dw 0x0000 db 0x00 ;; 0-3: segment type that specifies a read/write data segment db 10010010b db 11001111b dw 0x00 gdt32_end: ;; Value for GDTR register that describes the above GDT gdt32_pseudo_descriptor: ;; A limit value of 0 results in one valid byte. So, the limit value of our ;; GDT is its length in bytes minus 1. dw gdt32_end - gdt32_start - 1 ;; Start address of the GDT dd gdt32_start CODE_SEG32 equ gdt32_code_segment - gdt32_start DATA_SEG32 equ gdt32_data_segment - gdt32_start Switching to protected mode is very easy now. We load the GDT pseudo-descriptor into the GDTR register so that the base address and length of our GDT are known to the system. Lastly, we do a far jump to flush the instruction pipeline. ;; src/stage2.s section .stage2 [bits 16] ;; ... ;; Load GDT and switch to protected mode cli ; Can't have interrupts during the switch lgdt [gdt32_pseudo_descriptor] ;; Setting cr0.PE (bit 0) enables protected mode mov eax, cr0 or eax, 1 mov cr0, eax ;; The far jump into the code segment from the new GDT flushes ;; the CPU pipeline removing any 16-bit decoded instructions ;; and updates the cs register with the new code segment. jmp CODE_SEG32:start_prot_mode [bits 32] start_prot_mode: ;; Old segments are now meaningless mov ax, DATA_SEG32 mov ds, ax mov ss, ax mov es, ax mov fs, ax mov gs, ax ;; ... %include \"include/gdt32.s\" Interrupts are disabled during the switch. After the entire setup is complete, interrupts can be enabled again. This would require extra setup work. Now that we’re in protected mode, we can’t use the BIOS routines anymore. To print text, we can write straight to the VGA buffer instead. ;; src/stage2.s ;; ... ;; Writes a null-terminated string straight to the VGA buffer. ;; The address of the string is found in the bx register. print_string32: pusha VGA_BUF equ 0xb8000 WB_COLOR equ 0xf mov edx, VGA_BUF print_string32_loop: cmp byte [ebx], 0 je print_string32_return mov al, [ebx] mov ah, WB_COLOR mov [edx], ax add ebx, 1 ; Next character add edx, 2 ; Next VGA buffer cell jmp print_string32_loop print_string32_return: popa ret Best print something so that we know the switch worked. Note the message in the top left corner of the screenshot. 64-bit Long Mode For this part, refer to “10.8.5 Initializing IA-32e Mode”. Note that Intel calls the 64-bit mode “IA-32e” while AMD refers to it as “long mode” in the AMD64 manual. Before switching to long mode, the CPU must be in protected mode and paging must be enabled. We have protected mode now, but we are missing paging. I love paging. It’s just very cool. But I’d do a poor job at explaining the concept itself. Philipp Oppermann’s Introduction to Paging from the “Writing an OS in Rust” blog was really useful for me personally. OSTEP also talks about paging starting chapter 18, although it doesn’t go into the specifics of paging on x86 like Philipp Oppermann’s post does. In long mode with Physical Address Extension enabled (PAE, we’ll do that below ), a four level page table is used. The below code generates such a page table at a given address. ;; src/stage2.s ;; Builds a 4 level page table starting at the address that's passed in ebx. build_page_table: pusha PAGE64_PAGE_SIZE equ 0x1000 PAGE64_TAB_SIZE equ 0x1000 PAGE64_TAB_ENT_NUM equ 512 ;; Initialize all four tables to 0. If the present flag is cleared, all other bits in any ;; entry are ignored. So by filling all entries with zeros, they are all \"not present\". ;; Each repetition zeros four bytes at once. That's why a number of repetitions equal to ;; the size of a single page table is enough to zero all four tables. mov ecx, PAGE64_TAB_SIZE ; ecx stores the number of repetitions mov edi, ebx ; edi stores the base address xor eax, eax ; eax stores the value rep stosd ;; Link first entry in PML4 table to the PDP table mov edi, ebx lea eax, [edi + (PAGE64_TAB_SIZE11b)] ; Set read/write and present flags mov dword [edi], eax ;; Link first entry in PDP table to the PD table add edi, PAGE64_TAB_SIZE add eax, PAGE64_TAB_SIZE mov dword [edi], eax ;; Link the first entry in the PD table to the page table add edi, PAGE64_TAB_SIZE add eax, PAGE64_TAB_SIZE mov dword [edi], eax ;; Initialize only a single page on the lowest (page table) layer in ;; the four level page table. add edi, PAGE64_TAB_SIZE mov ebx, 11b mov ecx, PAGE64_TAB_ENT_NUM set_page_table_entry: mov dword [edi], ebx add ebx, PAGE64_PAGE_SIZE add edi, 8 loop set_page_table_entry popa ret Paging supersedes segmentation for managing virtual address spaces, permissions, etc. A Global Descriptor Table with segment descriptors is still needed though, and the segment descriptors must be modified slightly to enable long mode-specific features. This is another GDT that also implements the flat model. It’s almost identical to the GDT for protected mode. Just two bits were changed. ;; include/gdt64.s align 16 gdt64_start: ;; 8-byte null descriptor (index 0). dd 0x0 dd 0x0 gdt64_code_segment: dw 0xffff dw 0x0000 db 0x00 db 10011010b ;; 5: 64-bit code segment flag indicates that this segment contains 64-bit code ;; 6: must be zero if L bit (bit 5) is set db 10101111b db 0x00 gdt64_data_segment: dw 0xffff dw 0x0000 db 0x00 ;; 0-3: segment type that specifies a read/write data segment db 10010010b db 10101111b dw 0x00 gdt64_end: gdt64_pseudo_descriptor: dw gdt64_end - gdt64_start - 1 dd gdt64_start CODE_SEG64 equ gdt64_code_segment - gdt64_start DATA_SEG64 equ gdt64_data_segment - gdt64_start With the page table and the GDT in place, the switch from protected mode to long mode can be performed. ;; src/stage2.s ;; ... start_prot_mode: ;; ... ;; Build 4 level page table and switch to long mode mov ebx, 0x1000 call build_page_table mov cr3, ebx ; MMU finds the PML4 table in cr3 ;; Enable Physical Address Extension (PAE).

How in the world do you fit all that in 512 bytes? I'm guessing you don't have a real-world filesystem (that allows the kernel to be anywhere on the disk just as a normal file)? Because just dealing with file fragmentation should bump you way over 512 bytes I would imagine. reply rep_lodsb 2 hours agorootparentI've been thinking about how to structure a filesystem such that code complexity - in the boot loader and elsewhere - can be minimized. You'd want something similar to NTFS, except that it should be possible to refer to a file (MFT entry) directly by starting sector number. So they would either need to always remain at a fixed position, or have a link pointing back to any reference so it can be updated. Somewhere in the first sector (aligned to a 64 bit boundary), there would be a small structure that just contains a unique signature (not ASCII but some random value; 64 bits seems like more than enough as opposed to a GUID), and a pointer to the \"FS info block\". Leaving all remaining space in the sector available for boot code or possibly another \"overlayed\" filesystem. That info block in turn would point to the MFT entry for the stage 2 boot code. An MFT entry would contain at a minimum an easy to locate list of (start sector,count) extents. Maybe there could be a flag that tells the OS that a certain file should never be fragmented? File names would be entirely optional and for human consumption; for direct links within a filesystem, sector numbers would be used, and some kind of unique numeric identifier for anything \"higher-level\". I'm genuinely wondering if some expert here sees any problem with this scheme, other than it not conforming to how mainstream OSes do things? reply RiverCrochet 9 minutes agorootparent> File names would be entirely optional and for human consumption; for direct links within a filesystem, sector numbers would be used, and some kind of unique numeric identifier for anything \"higher-level\". Each file has index number (\"Inode\"?) in the MFT. The first 24 (0-23) are reserved, and 11 of them contain metadata about the volume . https://flatcap.github.io/linux-ntfs/ntfs/files/ - somewhere in the Windows API is something that allows opening a file by \"Inode\" number. This link and info may be really old so it could be more of the reserved inodes are used now. So, if 23 isn't being used yet, you could use that to put your 2BL - create a file there and name it $2BL or something. Would be funny to see what future Windows update that does use it does to it, if that ever happens (and of course maybe it is used). > Maybe there could be a flag that tells the OS that a certain file should never be fragmented? Haven't looked but I recall from an old book I read that small files are stored right in the MFT and I think existing data + the cluster size is the limit there. reply candiddevmike 46 minutes agorootparentprev> I've been thinking about how to structure a filesystem such that code complexity I guess I don't see the point in this because it already exists: FAT and it's variants .

The 80386 expands this to CR0, a 32 bits register. Then 64 bit long mode adds the EFER MSR and expands CR0 to 64 bits. But even today only 11 bits of CR0 are in use and EFER has 8 active bits. I wonder why intel/AMD did not simply use the free bits of the existing register, and made that decision twice? https://wiki.osdev.org/CPU_Registers_x86-64#CR0. reply rcxdude 5 hours agoparentProbably for more robust backwards compatibility with software that might assume a given value for or write to the reserved bits. The assignment of bits to registers like this in the hardware is pretty arbitrary, there's not really any cost to using the higher bits reply rep_lodsb 4 hours agorootparentThe flag register layout is another case of extreme backwards compatibility - its lower bits have the same definitions they had on the 8-bit 8080, even the same fixed values: Sign : Zero : always '0' : AuxCarry : always '0' : Parity : always '1' : Carry (the parity flag came all the way from the 8008 / Datapoint 2200[1], and is the inverted XOR of the result's lower 8 bits; aux carry is the carry out of bit 3, used for BCD arithmetic) Flag bit 15 has also stayed reserved, except at one time it was used by the NEC Vxx chips for their 8080 compatibility mode. That feature had to be first unlocked by executing a special instruction, because there is code out there that loads the entire (16 bit) flag register with 0000 or FFFF. With the mode bit unlocked, that would inadvertently switch the CPU to running a completely different set of opcodes!

You just put a Windows-like binary in a folder on a partition and it runs in a hosted environment in 64-bit mode. And of course there's countless bootloaders that can take care of all this for you too. reply leeter 2 hours agorootparentThis is fine if you're only running on a single core, however if you're a multiprocessor OS you still need to deal with legacy when bringing up the other cores. Intel and AMD should consider a mode that disables that and brings up the other cores using a 64bit SIPI. While I applaud Intel on the X86S idea... I think there is room for bits of that without throwing out all the backwards compat. An X86SC which drops real mode and only supports 16bit 'real mode' in virtualization. Yes, I see the argument that if you go to that point you might as well just use emulation. However running mixed 32bit/16bit code (Windows 98/95) becomes problematic just because of performance reasons. DosBox does well, but good luck supporting games for the Pentium 3 era that still used 16bit libraries because of course they did. (16bit Installshield was so common going into 64bit that MS just has code to replace it so 32bit applications can still be installed despite having a 16bit installer) reply rep_lodsb 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd then you're free from dealing with the somewhat convoluted processor init stuff, but instead depend on the Windows PE format, FAT filesystem, and an overcomplicated API.

I still believe CSP's maintain some of this support in their hypervisors' guest firmware for legacy OS binaries/ISO boot support? Also since Windows requires UEFI Secure boot enabled by default and CSM has to be disabled for the UEFI secure boot path, this is another reason legacy BIOS boot isn't exercised so much these days. We could have added legacy oroms hashes to UEFI Secure boot implementations https://patents.google.com/patent/US8694761B2/en, too, but again folks pushed back in their zeal to remove legacy BIOS overall. We didn't add the CSM spec https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents... to the PI https://uefi.org/specs/PI/1.8A/ since folks were hoping UEFI would remove the need for CSM.

You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website: Shit's lightweight and loads fast Fits on all your shitty screens Looks the same in all your shitty browsers The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee) Well guess what, motherfucker: You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit. You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why. It's fucking lightweight This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say \"Hi.\" at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit. It's responsive You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi. It fucking works Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker. It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is. Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you. This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before. Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful. Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them.

Another benefit is that I do not have to override or disable the CSS to make it even partially good, because it does not have CSS. It works how it is, unlike most. However: - Thecommand should not be needed, if the text is only ASCII anyways. - Thecommand should not be needed, if they use the simple HTML as this anyways (without CSS); the client should ought to set it automatically according to the user-defined window size. - They even have a command (with Google Analytics), which also should not be needed.

They should not add the pictures merely for decorations, but if you want to view a document explaining flowers then it is helpful to include the pictures of the flowers being described.

The ASCII quotations marks are good enough for most purposes, and are also more portable.

What most strikes me is that with ever so slightly more advanced browser defaults the Web could be ever so much more readable. What I'd like to see is a standard set of default page layouts (\"article\", \"overview\", \"lighttable\", \"catalogue\", \"discussion\", say) along with a few more primitive elements (notes, equations, interactive tables with some basic spreadsheet functionality,[1] and threaded discussions most principally) which could address a huge chunk of what's now highly-styled, and often unreadable, Web designs. The one thing I find not entirely universally suitable from my design is that the off-white / off-black background/text are not ideal for e-ink devices, though the overall effect remains generally readable. Gwern's own website () strikes me as one of the absolute best highly-styled websites, and absolutely stands out amongst that class. ________________________________ Notes: 1.

Perhaps they should add the reason for it, from Fermi's and Neumann's. When you are building a model of reality in Physics, If something doesn’t fit the experiments, you can’t just add a parameter (or more) variate it and fit the data. The model should have zero parameters, ideally, or the least possible, or, even at a more deeper level, the parameters should emerge naturally from some simple assumptions. With 4 parameters you don’t know whether you are really capturing a true aspect of reality of just fitting the data of some experiment. reply jampekka 30 minutes agoparentThis was mentioned in the first paragraph of the paper.

In many fields data is \"modeled\" with huge regression models with dozens of parameters or even neural networks with billions of parameters. > In 1953, Enrico Fermi criticized Dyson’s model by quoting Johnny von Neumann: “With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.”[1]. This quote is intended to tell Dyson that while his model may appear complex and precise, merely increasing the number of parameters to fit the data does not necessarily imply that the model has real physical significance. reply elijahbenizzy 1 hour agoprevThis is humorous (and well-written), but I think its more than that. I'm always making the joke (observation) that ML (AI) is just curve-fitting. Whether \"just curve-fitting\" is enough to produce something \"intelligent\" is, IMO, currently unanswered, largely due to differing viewpoints on the meaning of \"intelligent\". In this case they're demonstrating some very clean, easy-to-understand curve-fitting, but it's really the same process -- come up with a target, optimize over a loss function, and hope that it generalizes, (this one, obviously, does not. But the elephant is cute.) This raises the question Neumann was asking -- why have so many parameters? Ironically (or maybe just interestingly), we've done a lot with a ton of parameters recently, answering it with \"well, with a lot of parameters you can do cool things\". reply visarga 49 minutes agoparent> Whether \"just curve fitting\" is enough to produce something \"intelligent\" is, IMO, currently unanswered Continual \"curve fitting\" to the real world can create intelligence. What is missing is not something inside the model. It's missing a mechanism to explore, search and expand its experience. Our current crop of LLMs ride on human experience, they have not largely participated in creating their own experiences. That's why people call it imitation learning or parroting. But once models become more agentic they can start creating useful experiences on their own. AlphaZero did it. reply soist 34 minutes agorootparentAlphaZero did not create any experiences. AlphaZero was software written by people to play board games and that's all it ever did. reply maitola 30 minutes agoparentprevIn the case of AI, the more parameters, the better! In Physics is the opposite. reply luplex 37 minutes agoparentprevI mean the devil is in the details. In Reinforcement Learning, the target moves! In deep learning, you often do things like early stopping to prevent too much optimization. reply soist 33 minutes agorootparentThere is no such thing as too much optimization. Early stopping is to prevent overfitting to the training set. It's a trick just like most advances in deep learning because the underlying mathematics is fundamentally not suited for creating intelligent agents. reply bee_rider 13 minutes agoprevYa know, in academic writing I tend to struggle with making it sound nice and formal. I try not to use the super-stilted academic style, but it is still always a struggle to walk the line between too loose and too jargony. Maybe this sort of thing would be a really good tradition. Everyone must write a very silly article with some mathematical arguments in it. Then, we can all go forward with the comfort of knowing that we aren’t really at risk of breaking new grounds in appearing unserious. It is well written and very understandable! reply EdwardCoffin 3 hours agoprevFreeman Dyson recounts the episode [1] that inspired this paper in his web of life interviews (prepositioned to the fitting an elephant bit) [2] [1] https://youtu.be/hV41QEKiMlM [2] https://youtu.be/hV41QEKiMlM?t=118 reply parker-3461 2 hours agoparentThanks for linking these, I was not very familiar of these works/discussions taking place in the past, but these really helped establish the context. Very grateful that these videos are readily available. reply EdwardCoffin 1 hour agorootparentI listened to the whole series with Dyson some time in the past year. It was well worth it. I also listened to the series with Murray Gell-Mann [1] and Hans Bethe [2]. All time well worth spending, and I've been thinking of downloading all the bits, concatenating them into audio files, and putting them on my phone for listening to when out on walks (I'm pretty sure the videos do not add anything essential: it's just a video of the interviewee talking - no visual aids).

This was a lovely passage from Dyson’s Web of Stories interview, and it struck a chord with me, like it clearly did with the authors too. It happened when Dyson took the preliminary results of his work on the Pseudoscalar theory of Pions to Fermi and Fermi very quickly dismissed the whole thing. It was a shock to Dyson but freed him from wasting more time on it. Fermi: When one does a theoretical calculation, either you have a clear physical module in mind or a rigorous mathematical basis. You have neither. How many free parameters did you use for your fitting? Dyson: 4 Fermi: You know, Johnny Von Neumann always used to say ‘with four parameters I can fit an elephant; and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk’. reply Steuard 1 hour agoprevSadly, the constant term (the average r_0) is never specified in the paper (it seems to be something in the neighborhood of 180?): getting that right is necessary to produce the image, and I can't see any way not to consider it a fifth necessary parameter. So I don't think they've genuinely accomplished their goal. (Seriously, though, this was a lot of fun!) reply rsfern 52 minutes agoparentThey say in the text that it’s the average value of the data points they fit to. I think whether to count it as a parameter depends on whether you consider standardization to be part of the model or not reply dheera 2 hours agoprevI wish there was more humor on arXiv.

Somewhat closer to home, I think computer scientist Conor McBride[3] is the champion of paper titles (entries include “Elimination with a motive”, “The gentle art of levitation”, “I am not a number: I am a free variable”, “Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right”, and “Doo bee doo bee doo”) and sometimes code in papers: letmeB this (F you)you == me = B thisotherwise = F you letmeB this (B that) = B that letmeB this (App fun arg) = letmeB this fun `App` letmeB this arg (Yes, this is working code; yes, it’s crystal clear in the context of the paper.)

A compex parameter (z(theta) = sum(e^(z_ theta))) can draw more squiggly figures (epicycles) -- the pen can backtrack as the drawing arm rotates, as each parameter can move a point somewhere on a small circle around the point computed from the previous parameter (and recursively).

A couple years into my career, I was trying to get my AWS keys configured right locally. I hardcoded them into my .zshrc file. A few days later on a Sunday, forgetting that I'd done that, I committed and pushed that file to my public dotfiles repo, at which point those keys were instantly and automatically compromised. After the dust settled, the CTO pulled me into the office and said: 1. So that I know you know: explain to me what you did, why it shouldn't have happened, and how you'll avoid it in the future. 2. This is not your fault - it's ours. These keys were way overpermissioned and our safeguards were inadequate - we'll fix that. 3. As long as it doesn't happen again, we're cool. Looking back, 10 years later, I think that was exactly the right way to handle it. Address what the individual did, but realize that it's a process issue. If your process only works when 100% of people act perfectly 100% of the time, your process does not work and needs fixing. reply kmarc 20 hours agoparentBesides the obvious takeaway of the story, to anyone who reads this: use pre-commit hooks to avoid this kind of problems (or something equivalent).

Say no more. reply nanoxide 4 hours agoparentprevNever worked with AWS, but besides that it obviously shouldn't happen - is it really that bad? Couldn't the keys be invalidated/regenerated immediately after you realized they were compromised? reply vvanders 21 hours agoparentprevYep, been adjacent enough to a couple large ones through my career to see the details and been up-close to a few that this is the right way to approach it. Did the person know they screwed up? Did they show remorse and a willingness to dive in and sort it out? They likely feel like absolute shit about the whole thing and you don't need to come down on them like a ton of bricks. If that much damage could be done with a single person then you have a gap in your process/culture/etc and that should be addressed from the top. One of the best takes I've seen on this was from a previous manager who when confronted with a similar situation as the article(it was a full DB drop). The person tried to hand in their resignation on the spot, they instead(and I'm paraphrasing here) said: \"You're the most qualified person to handle this risk in the future as we've just spent $(insert revenue hit here) training you. Moving forward we want you to own backup/restore and making sure those things work\". That person ended up being one of their best engineers and they had fantastic resiliency moving forward. It turns out if you give someone a bit of grace and trust when they realize they screwed up you'll end up with a stronger organization and culture because of it. reply Aurornis 20 hours agorootparent> they instead(and I'm paraphrasing here) said: \"You're the most qualified person to handle this risk in the future as we've just spent $(insert revenue hit here) training you. This is an old quote that has been originally attributed to different people throughout the years. It shows up in a lot of different management books and, more recently, LinkedIn influencer posts. It’s good for lightening the situation and adding some levity, but after hearing it repeated 100 different times from different books, podcasts, and LinkedIn quotes it has really worn on me as somewhat dishonest. It feels clever the first time you hear it, but really the cost of the mistake is a separate issue from the decision to fire someone for it. In real world situations, the decision to let someone go involved a deeper dive into assessing whether the incident was really a one-off mistake, or the culmination of a pattern of careless behavior, failure to learn, or refusal to adopt good practices. I’ve seen situations where the actual dollar amount of the damage was negligible, but the circumstances that caused the accident were so egregiously bad and avoidable that we couldn’t justify allowing the person to continue operating in the role. I wish it was as simple as training people up or having them learn from their mistakes, but some people are so relentlessly careless that it’s better for everyone to just cut losses. However when the investigation shows that the incident really was a one-time mistake from someone with an otherwise strong history of learning and growing, cutting that person for a single accident is a mistake. The important thing to acknowledge is point #3 from the post above: Once you’ve made an expensive mistake, that’s usually your last freebie. The next expensive mistake isn’t very likely to be joked away as another “expensive training” reply latexr 5 hours agorootparent> This is an old quote that has been originally attributed to different people throughout the years. It shows up in a lot of different management books and, more recently, LinkedIn influencer posts. And a similar story has been recounted by pilot Bob Hoover, where a member of the ground crew fuelled Hoover’s airplane incorrectly. Instead of a dollar amount, the cost is that Hoover and the two passengers could have died. https://sierrahotel.net/blogs/news/a-life-lesson#:~:text=%E2... reply vvanders 20 hours agorootparentprevI'm fairly certain it occured since the story was first-hand and about 12+ years ago(although they may have lifted it from similar sources). It's not a bad way to diffuse things if it's clear there was an honest mistake Your point on willingness to learn is bang on. If there's no remorse or intentionally negligent then yes that's a different story. reply Aurornis 20 hours agorootparentOh I’m sure it occurred. The CEO was just repeating it from the countless number of management books where the quote appears. My point was that it’s a story that gets overlaid on top of the real decision making process reply NegativeK 20 hours agorootparentprevTo quote a statistician friend: 100% of humans make mistakes. OP's leadership was shit. The org let a junior dev delete shit in prod and then didn't own up to _their_ mistake? Did they later go on to work at a genetics company and blame users for being the subject of password sprays? reply nine_k 20 hours agoparentprevHere's one of may favorite anecdotes / fables on the topic. A young trader joined a financial company. He tried hard to shoe how good and useful he was, and he indeed was, at the rookie level. One day he made a mistake, directly and undeniably attributable to him, and lost $200k due to that mistake. Crushed and depressed, he came to his boss and said: — Sir! I failed so badly. I think I'm not fit for this job. I want to leave the company. But the boss went furious: — How dare you, yes, how dare you ask me to let you go right after we've invested $200k in your professional training?! reply ay 21 hours agoparentprevSo much this. There is a great book which I think should be on a table of every single person (especially leadership) working in any place which involves humans interacting with machines: https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Understanding-Human-Error... reply csa 19 hours agorootparentIs that a referral link on HN?

His co-founder (remotely present via Skype) chimed in \"you're lucky to still be here\". this type of leadership needs to be put on blast. 2010 or 2024, doesn’t matter. If it’s going to cost “millions in revenue”, then maybe it would have been prudent to invest time in proper data access controls, proper backups, and rollback procedures. Absolutely incompetent leadership should never be hired ever again. There should be a public blacklist so I don’t make the mistake of ever working with such idiocy. The only people ever “fired” should be leadership. Unless the intent is on purpose in which you should be subject to jail time reply computerdork 20 hours agoparentYeah, this is the lesson learned, why are they working in production??

That is shit leadership. It reveals they will hold a grudge about that event which the employee won’t ever live down and is likely to impair their growth in the company. After that event one should start looking for a new job. reply idle_zealot 20 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like they know they fucked up, but blamed their employee to avoid taking responsibility. Whether or not they chose to terminate the scapegoat is irrelevant to determining that they're bad leaders. reply BoorishBears 16 hours agorootparentOh please. It's shared blame, not no blame. The provess needs to improve but the query didn't run itself, leaving the person in their position but giving them what sounds like a light chewing out isn't a sign of bad leadership. reply hinkley 14 hours agorootparentprevBlaming the employee means you can emotionally extort them for the rest of their tenure and use them to balance out the raise pool. reply freehorse 21 hours agoprevThis sounds like a company that does not learn from errors, looks for \"junior engineer\" scapegoats instead of looking for the systemic processes that facilitated this, and not a great place to stay tbh. This was a chance for the company to reflect on some of their processes, and take measures that will avoid similar issues (and the steps to take are pretty obvious). And the description of what happened afterwords show a probably toxic environment. It should never be like this, and especially in this case I blame OP 0%. This is something that could happen to anybody in such circumstances. I have not deleted a full database, but have had to restore stuff a few times, I have made mistakes myself and have rushed to fix problems caused by others' mistakes and each single time the whole point and discussions was about improving our processes so that this does not happen again. reply computerdork 19 hours agoparentAgreed, and who allows the devs to work in production, even at small companies?

Lack of backups is inexcusable, and ten times more egregious than the author's mistake. reply dudus 21 hours agoprevSo a company gives junior engineers full access to a production database without backup so they can work on it developing features that require DDL SQL commands.

I've seen orgs where a blameless type culture isn't natural, and I've had to explain to the leadership that publicly humiliating (in jest) someone for getting caught by the phishing tests or posting private data to a pastebin type service is a bad idea. And I've interacted with plenty of people who externalize everything that goes wrong to them, naturally some of these folks will be in leadership positions. reply cybervegan 21 hours agoprevThere's a lot of responsibility there resting on your superiors because they weren't following \"best practises\". Sure you fucked up, but if they had backups, it wouldn't have been such a disaster, and if you had a Dev environment to test against, it would have been a non-issue entirely. Straight out of Uni, you shouldn't have been expected to know that, but I bet you grew as a consequence. reply Spivak 20 hours agoparentYep, whether the leadership recognizes it or not this is an organizational failure. No access controls for destroying prod data, no backups, no recovery plan, told to do testing in prod, whatever horrible process they have that required engineers regularly directly accessing the database. reply kaiokendev 20 hours agoprevHave been in situations just like this, on pretty much every side (the fuck-upper, the person who has to fix the fuck up, and the person who has to come up with a fuck-up remediation plan) The most egregious case involved an incompetent configuration that resulted in hundreds of millions $ in lost data and a 6-month long automated recovery project. Fortunately, there were traces of the data across the entire stack - from page caches in a random employee's browser, to automated reports and OCR dumps. By the end of the project, all data was recovered. No one from outside ever found out or even realized anything had happened - we had redundancy upon redundancy across several parts of the business, and the entire company basically shifted the way we did ops to work around the issue for the time being. Every department had a scorecard tracking how many of their files were recovered, and we had little celebrations when we hit recovery milestones. To this day only a few people know who was responsible (wasn't me! lol) Blame and derision are always inevitable in situations like this. It's how it's handled afterwards that really marks the competence of the company. reply heelix 4 hours agoprevI've really come to appreciate blameless post postmortems. People hide mistakes when you have a culture that punishes. My biggest foible: Our 400 person company had issued blackberries and was pulled into a project where all the work was in India. I covered EMEA, and phone rates were like a quarter a minute, or something like that. There was no concern about using the phone/data. I ended up spending a significant amount of time over there and one thing I noticed is it looked like I had a different carrier every time I looked at the device. Did not think much of it in the couple months I was there. When I got back - one of our Ops guys called me and we discovered it was closer to $9/min, with absurd data charges. Sat down with the CFO, as the $12k charge was not projected. I had no idea if I was about to be canned or not. Instead, leadership and sales got brand new blackberries, with an unlocked SIM card. Celebrations by all the brass... Was very happy to have a job. reply easeout 18 hours agoprevThat's a mistake I've made before, except we did have nightly backups. I was not the one who set up the backups, nor did I perform the restore. I just told my senior I made a big mistake, and he said thanks for saying so right away and we're going to handle it. Our client company told their people to take the rest of the day off. It must have been costly. I learned a lesson, but I also internalized some guilt about it. Reflecting on this, I was in an environment where it was the norm to edit production live, imagining we could be careful enough. I'm suggesting that the error the author publicly took the fall for was not all their fault. Everyone up the chain was responsible for creating that risky situation. How could they not have backups? reply cstrahan 20 hours agoprevI can relate to this with my own story, where I managed to delete an entire database — my first day on the job, no less. I was hired by a little photo development company, doing both walk in jobs and electronic B2B orders. I was brought in to pick up on the maintenance and development of the B2B order placement web service the previous developer had written. Sadly, the previous dev designed the DB schema and software under the assumption that there would only ever be one business customer. When that ceased to be the case, he decided to simply create another database and spin up another process. So here I am on my first day, tasked with creating a new empty database to bring on another customer. I used the Microsoft SQL Server admin GUI to generate the DDL from one of the existing tables, created (and switched the connection to) a pristine, new DB, and ran the script. Little did I know, in the middle of many thousands of lines of SQL, the script switched the connection back to the DB from which the DDL was generated, and then proceeds to drop every single table. Oops. Of course, the last dev disabled back ups a couple months before I joined. My one saving grace was that the dev had some strange fixation on logging every single thing that happened in a bunch of XML log files; I managed to quickly write some code to rebuild the state of the DB from those log files. I was (and am) grateful to my boss for trusting my ability to resolve the problem I had created, and placing as much value as he did in my ownership of the problem. That was about 16 years ago. One of the best working experiences in my career, and a time of rapid technical growth for myself. I would have missed out on a lot if that had been handled differently. reply esafak 20 hours agoparent> Sadly, the previous dev designed the DB schema and software under the assumption that there would only ever be one business customer. What kind of an assumption is that?! reply sosodev 20 hours agorootparentIt's not uncommon for B2B software to isolate each customer in their own database. reply esafak 19 hours agorootparentYes, but that is not the same as assuming there would only be one customer. I think your interpretation makes more sense. reply lkrubner 18 hours agoprevIf it's true that the company had no backups of their production database, then the engineer was nearly blameless. The CTO should have been fired. If there was no CTO, then the Board Of Directors should have asked the CEO why they felt they were competent to run a software company without a CTO. If the CEO was technical enough to take responsibility for technical decisions, then the CEO should have been fired or severely reprimanded. If a software company is making money, but developers develop against the production database, and there are no backups, then its the leadership that is at fault. The leadership deserves severe criticism. reply loktarogar 21 hours agoprevNo junior should have been able to cause this much damage on their own without a safety net of some kind. It's on the company for cancelling their backups. reply badgersnake 22 hours agoprevI wouldn’t blame you for resigning, it sounds like an awful environment. But individuals will always make mistakes, systems and processes prevent individuals mistakes from doing damage. That’s what was lacking here, not your fault at all. I just hope lessons were learned. reply unyttigfjelltol 22 hours agoparentShould have spun it as a novel game feature. Like burning the library at Alexandria. reply menzoic 21 hours agoprevClearly the fault of a terribly lead engineering organization. Mistakes are almost guaranteed to happen. This is why good engineering orgs have guardrails in place. There were no guardrails whatsoever here. Accounts used to manually access adhoc production databases should not have delete permissions for critical data. And worst off all no backups. reply m463 15 hours agoprevI can remember my huge fuckups on a few fingers of one hand. I'm not implying there are few of them, more like they each have a dedicated finger, and I remember them and the cold sweat feel of each specific one. The first one was decades ago. There was a server room. They had a hardcopy printer in there, and behind it was a big red mushroom button that shut down the whole room. It was about head level if you were looking behind the printer... reply D-Coder 1 hour agoparentI witnessed a similar one. The big box had an emergency power-off switch in back that stuck out. Our operator was dealing with cabling behind the big box, and when he stood up, his belt caught the switch. Oops. reply Kagerjay 2 hours agoprevIts really the fault of the process decided by upper management, a junior dev shouldnt have that much access. Least access privilege wasnt done correctly here reply lrvick 9 hours agoprevAny privileged access or secrets given to engineers in plaintext on their daily driver workstations -will- be compromised or misused. Full stop. There is never a good reason to do this apart from management inexperienced in security and infrastructure management. Every single usage of secrets of privileged action of consequence must go through code review followed by multiple signatures where an automated system does the dangerous things on your behalf with a paper trail. Never follow any instructions to place privileged secrets or access in plaintext on an development OS or you might well be the one a CEO chooses as a sacrificial lamb. reply steve_adams_86 20 hours agoprevI can't imagine putting someone who's new to this work in that kind of precarious position. If I let someone make a mistake that severe, I'd apologize to them and work with them through the solution and safeguards to prevent it from happening again. A little bit of room for error is essential for learning, but this is insane. I'm so glad the only person who has ever put me in that kind of position is me, haha. This career would have seemed so much scarier if the people I worked with early on were willing to trust me with such terrifying error margins. reply hcarvalhoalves 20 hours agoprev> The CEO leaned across the table, got in my face, and said, \"this, is a monumental fuck up. You're gonna cost us millions in revenue\". His co-founder (remotely present via Skype) chimed in \"you're lucky to still be here\". Should expose the CEO’s name. Between this and forcing you to work 3 days straight, that was the least professional way to handle this situation. reply dlevine 18 hours agoprevAfter 20+ years in tech, the only time I have ever seen a developer fired for making a mistake was when he leaked credentials because he used one of our repos as the base for an interview project at another company (on a day when he was allegedly working from home). We had a hardcoded key in our package.json to allow it to access a private repo, and he pushed that to a public repo which had an incriminating name like company-x-interview-project-hisname. We immediately got an email from Github because they scan for such things. We rotated our keys within a few minutes, and he was gone the next day. Obviously we should have been more careful with our keys, so all would have been forgiven if not for the fact that he leaked keys while looking for another job on company time. reply sgerenser 5 hours agoparentSo the question is… did he get the job with Company X? reply microflash 15 hours agoprevI recently dealt with something like this. Someone ran a `delete *` statement which truncated a bunch of tables in production with critical business data. They had autocommit on in their database client. Luckily, there was a backup available which restored the data. After the analysis, it was decided to provision less privileged roles and explicitly turn off autocommit in all database clients. I am also introducing a PR workflow with static analysis that detects these issues. Nobody was fired and no names were ever mentioned in the announcements. reply delichon 20 hours agoprevIt makes you a better developer. I backup obsessively BECAUSE I fucked up almost this badly and more than once. Hire yourself back and charge a bit more for the extra wisdom. reply throw156754228 12 hours agoprevA typical commercial change control process exists to factor in human error. There's a cost to setting it up. This company never set it up, but ended up paying another way. reply doctor_eval 22 hours agoprev> I found myself on the phone to Rackspace, leaning on a desk for support, listening to their engineer patiently explain that backups for this MySQL instance had been cancelled over 2 months ago. Ah. There is no part of this story that’s the protagonist’s fault. What a mess. reply occz 22 hours agoparentAgreed. Negligence bordering on criminal all the way up the management chain. The fact that they blamed the author is telling about the culture as well. reply pjerem 19 hours agoparentprevYeah. And even if this cancellation was to save money, it’s not even an excuse. What is hard and expansive are easy to restore backups. Simple backups that may be a pain to restore but that are going to save your company from bankruptcy are only costing you some cheap storage and someone that more or less routinely checks that your data is safe somewhere. I mean, of course I’m not advocating for flaky backups but even when you are cheap as fuck, you can afford a cron script running rsync and a couple hard disk drives. Going fully yolo on this topic should not be even remotely acceptable in any business. reply cwales95 22 hours agoparentprevYeah, cannot help but agree. It should have been impossible for this to happen in the first place. reply RaftPeople 21 hours agorootparent> It should have been impossible for this to happen in the first place. Exactly, CEO should have fired himself for allowing that environment to exist. reply newaccountman2 21 hours agoprev> backups for this MySQL instance had been cancelled over 2 months ago. Uhh, there's the problem, not that someone accidentally deleted something lol reply rambojohnson 2 hours agoprevthe fact that the leadership vilified a JUNIOR developer on the erasure of a PRODUCTION database speaks volumes as to how toxic of a workplace this was. glad to hear you promptly walked out. screw places like this. disgusting. reply alex_lav 20 hours agoprev> I found myself on the phone to Rackspace, leaning on a desk for support, listening to their engineer patiently explain that backups for this MySQL instance had been cancelled over 2 months ago. Ah. As usual, a company with legitimately moronic processes experiences the consequences of those moronic processes when a \"junior\" person breaks something. Whoever turned off those backups as well as whoever thought devs (especially \"junior\" devs) should be mutating prod tables by hand are ultimately accountable. reply amackera 22 hours agoprevLess \"Firing yourself\" and more like liberating yourself from a toxic unprofessional clown show. reply andrewstuart 20 hours agoprevIt is ALWAYS the fault of management when the databases are lost. Engineers must never feel guilty if the company was run in such a way as to make that possible. reply langcss 8 hours agoprev [–] She got gaslit. As a junior.
