    "content": "PRESS RELEASEJune 5, 2023Introducing Apple Vision Pro: Apple\u2019s first spatial computerIntroducing the era of spatial computing with Apple Vision Pro.CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today unveiled Apple Vision Pro, a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others. Vision Pro creates an infinite canvas for apps that scales beyond the boundaries of a traditional display and introduces a fully three-dimensional user interface controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible \u2014 a user\u2019s eyes, hands, and voice. Featuring visionOS, the world\u2019s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space. The breakthrough design of Vision Pro features an ultra-high-resolution display system that packs 23 million pixels across two displays, and custom Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design to ensure every experience feels like it\u2019s taking place in front of the user\u2019s eyes in real time.\u201cToday marks the beginning of a new era for computing,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cJust as the Mac introduced us to personal computing, and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro introduces us to spatial computing. Built upon decades of Apple innovation, Vision Pro is years ahead and unlike anything created before \u2014 with a revolutionary new input system and thousands of groundbreaking innovations. It unlocks incredible experiences for our users and exciting new opportunities for our developers.\u201d\u201cCreating our first spatial computer required invention across nearly every facet of the system,\u201d said Mike Rockwell, Apple\u2019s vice president of the Technology Development Group. \u201cThrough a tight integration of hardware and software, we designed a standalone spatial computer in a compact wearable form factor that is the most advanced personal electronics device ever.\u201dExtraordinary New ExperiencesApple Vision Pro brings a new dimension to powerful, personal computing by changing the way users interact with their favorite apps, capture and relive memories, enjoy stunning TV shows and movies, and connect with others in FaceTime.An infinite canvas for apps at work and at home: visionOS features a three-dimensional interface that frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale. Apple Vision Pro enables users to be even more productive, with infinite screen real estate, access to their favorite apps, and all-new ways to multitask. And with support for Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, users can set up the perfect workspace or bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Vision Pro wirelessly, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display with incredibly crisp text.Engaging entertainment experiences: With two ultra-high-resolution displays, Apple Vision Pro can transform any space into a personal movie theater with a screen that feels 100 feet wide and an advanced Spatial Audio system. Users can watch movies and TV shows, or enjoy stunning three-dimensional movies. Apple Immersive Video offers 180-degree high-resolution recordings with Spatial Audio, and users can access an exciting lineup of immersive videos that transport them to entirely new places.Spatial computing makes new types of games possible with titles that can span a spectrum of immersion and bring gamers into all-new worlds. Users can also play over 100 Apple Arcade games on a screen as large as they want, with incredible immersive audio and support for popular game controllers.Immersive Environments: With Environments, a user\u2019s world can grow beyond the dimensions of a physical room with dynamic, beautiful landscapes that can help them focus or reduce clutter in busy spaces. A twist of the Digital Crown lets a user control how present or immersed they are in an environment. Memories come alive: Featuring Apple\u2019s first three-dimensional camera, Apple Vision Pro lets users capture, relive, and immerse themselves in favorite memories with Spatial Audio. Every spatial photo and video transports users back to a moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering. Users can access their entire photo library on iCloud, and view their photos and videos at a life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail. Every Panorama shot on iPhone expands and wraps around the user, creating the sensation they are standing right where it was taken.FaceTime becomes spatial: With Apple Vision Pro, FaceTime calls take advantage of the room around the user, with everyone on the call reflected in life-size tiles, as well as Spatial Audio, so it sounds as if participants are speaking right from where they are positioned. Users wearing Vision Pro during a FaceTime call are reflected as a Persona \u2014 a digital representation of themselves created using Apple\u2019s most advanced machine learning techniques \u2014 which reflects face and hand movements in real time. Users can do things together like watch a movie, browse photos, or collaborate on a presentation.Even more app experiences: Apple Vision Pro has an all-new App Store where users can discover apps and content from developers, and access hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps that run great and automatically work with the new input system for Vision Pro. Apple\u2019s developer community can go even further and take advantage of the powerful and unique capabilities of Vision Pro and visionOS to design brand-new app experiences, and reimagine existing ones for spatial computing.A Revolutionary Operating System and User InterfaceBuilt on the foundation of decades of engineering innovation in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, visionOS was designed from the ground up to support the low-latency requirements of spatial computing. The result is a revolutionary operating system that delivers powerful spatial experiences that can take advantage of the space around the user, unlocking new opportunities at work and at home.visionOS features a brand-new three-dimensional interface that makes digital content look and feel present in a user\u2019s physical world. By responding dynamically to natural light and casting shadows, it helps the user understand scale and distance. To enable user navigation and interaction with spatial content, Apple Vision Pro introduces an entirely new input system controlled by a person\u2019s eyes, hands, and voice. Users can browse through apps by simply looking at them, tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using voice to dictate.Apple Vision Pro also features EyeSight, an extraordinary innovation that helps users stay connected with those around them. When a person approaches someone wearing Vision Pro, the device feels transparent \u2014 letting the user see them while also displaying the user\u2019s eyes. When a user is immersed in an environment or using an app, EyeSight gives visual cues to others about what the user is focused on.Breakthrough DesignApple Vision Pro builds on Apple innovation and experience designing high-performance products like Mac, iPhone, and wearables like Apple Watch, culminating in the most advanced personal electronics device ever. To achieve ambitious goals for performance, mobility, and wearability, Apple utilized the most advanced materials possible. Apple Vision Pro has an astonishing amount of technology in a compact design. A singular piece of three-dimensionally formed and laminated glass is polished to create an optical surface that acts as a lens for the wide array of cameras and sensors needed to blend the physical world with digital content. The glass flows into the custom aluminum alloy frame that gently curves around the user\u2019s face, while the modular system allows for a tailored fit to accommodate a wide range of people. The Light Seal is made of a soft textile, and comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to a user\u2019s face for a precise fit. Flexible straps ensure audio remains close to the user\u2019s ears, while a Head Band \u2014 available in multiple sizes \u2014 is three-dimensionally knitted as a single piece to provide cushioning, breathability, and stretch.1 The band is secured with a simple mechanism, making it easy to change to another size or style of band.Unrivaled Innovation in HardwareApple Vision Pro is designed to deliver phenomenal compute performance in a compact wearable form factor. Featuring a breakthrough ultra-high-resolution display system built on top of an Apple silicon chip, Vision Pro uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, with wide color and high dynamic range. This technological breakthrough, combined with custom catadioptric lenses that enable incredible sharpness and clarity, delivers jaw-dropping experiences. Users with vision correction needs will use ZEISS Optical Inserts to ensure visual fidelity and eye tracking accuracy.2An advanced Spatial Audio system is core to the Apple Vision Pro experience, creating the feeling that sounds are coming from the environment around the user and matching the sound to the space. Two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user\u2019s own head and ear geometry.3In addition to creating a breakthrough display and advanced audio experiences, the high-performance eye tracking system in Apple Vision Pro uses high-speed cameras and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the user\u2019s eyes for responsive, intuitive input.These groundbreaking innovations are powered by Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. M2 delivers unparalleled standalone performance, while the brand-new R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user\u2019s eyes, in real time. R1 streams new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds \u2014 8x faster than the blink of an eye. Apple Vision Pro is designed for all-day use when plugged in, and up to two hours of use with its external, high-performance battery.Industry-Leading Privacy and SecurityApple Vision Pro is built on a strong foundation of privacy and security, and keeps users in control of their data.Optic ID is a new secure authentication system that analyzes a user\u2019s iris under various invisible LED light exposures, and then compares it to the enrolled Optic ID data that is protected by the Secure Enclave to instantly unlock Apple Vision Pro. A user\u2019s Optic ID data is fully encrypted, is not accessible to apps, and never leaves their device, meaning it is not stored on Apple servers. Where a user looks stays private while navigating Apple Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. Additionally, data from the camera and other sensors is processed at the system level, so individual apps do not need to see a user\u2019s surroundings to enable spatial experiences. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.Pricing and AvailabilityApple Vision Pro starts at $3,499 (U.S.), and will be available early next year on apple.com and at Apple Store locations in the U.S., with more countries coming later next year. Customers will be able to learn about, experience, and personalize their fit for Vision Pro at Apple Store locations.

    "hn_content": "Apple announced its first spatial computer, the Apple Vision Pro. While the hardware is impressive, some are skeptical about the practical application of a bulky VR headset, with limited use cases outside of niche gaming, and the potential discomfort it might cause for long-term use. However, it could be useful for individuals who need more monitor space and have ample neck movement. For those who are wealthy, frequent travelers, it could be useful for remote meetings and presentations. The headset will be sold for $3,500, and it is set to challenge other VR headset makers such as the NReal Air, which is cheaper and lighter. Apple intends to release a cheaper and more updated model in the future.Apple's upcoming AR/VR headset boasts an impressive resolution, with 23 million pixels spread across two panels. However, some users have pointed out that despite this high resolution, the dot pitch of the display is still less than a good quality high end monitor. Reading text in VR is generally a horrible experience. Apple's foveated rendering system relies on lenses on a gimbal inside the headset that can take\u00a0a moment to respond to eye-tracking. Apple's AR/VR headset can be used as a mobile computer,\u00a0but it still needs a keyboard. There\u00a0will be a limited market for AR/VR devices in the prosumer market where the headset is priced too high. The killer app sells systems, but no one will make the killer app as it is not economically feasible.\u00a0Virtual reality (VR) is perceived as a potential solution to the issue of insufficient workspace; it also has the potential to revolutionize gaming, CAD, and AR\u2010based instruction. The weight of this technology's development cost is not justifiable by virtue of it being too expensive for what it offers. The Apple headset has a lower-than-anticipated level of resolution, but it may be used to work remotely more effectively and also for programmers who value low weight and portability; it is not ideal for those with difficulty turning their heads. Finally, it offers plenty of opportunities to enhance window management.Apple has announced the Apple Pro Display XDR, a large 6K monitor, as well as a new virtual and augmented reality system, the Apple Vision Pro. The latter is a headset that uses cameras to offer augmented reality, has a 120-degree field of view, spatial audio and a Lidar scanner. The display has already been praised for its clarity, as it features a display resolution that is more than five times as high as a typical VR headset. However, critics have suggested that the $3,000 product will be primarily useful for media consumption and telepresence meetings, rather than being helpful with day-to-day tasks or monitor work.Apple has announced a new AR headset, the Vision Pro, which allows users to interact with their environment while wearing the headset. The headset can support multiple apps and can be controlled by voice, a virtual keyboard, or Bluetooth keyboards and trackpads. The battery is designed for two-hour sessions but can be charged while in use. The high price point may limit the consumer adoption of this product, but it could be useful for early adopters or professionals who need to work remotely while on the go. The potential of being able to work seamlessly within the headset and replace traditional monitors and laptops is exciting, but it remains to be seen if the headset is comfortable to wear for extended periods and can provide a clear view for reading and typing. In addition, the headset may not support mouse input, which is a concern for some users.Apple's new mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, will allow users to turn any space into a workspace, with virtual monitors integrated into the headset. It's been positioned as a productivity tool, but users may also enjoy the headset for watching content. However, questions remain about the device's ease of use, including how users will interact with the virtual monitors and if the headset will cause discomfort during prolonged use. Users may also need to learn touch-typing to interact with a keyboard, although an external keyboard could be used. The headset will likely be attractive to business and first-class travelers looking for a better way to consume content on long-haul flights.Apple's new VR headset, Vision Pro, will come with an in-seat power capability and a two-hour battery life, potentially a solution for those seeking VR entertainment during long flights. An additional battery may cost extra, but third-party brands such as Anker or Belkin might release longer-lasting versions that are more cost-effective. Most planes have outlets available, though the number of times a plug has been able to support a charging brick tends to be quite low. Vision Pro has smaller and more effective screens than virtual reality headsets such as Oculus Quest, and its mixed reality will gradually transition between VR and AR. Its bulky size and cost might limit its target audience to people with more disposable income or for specific use cases.Apple has released a new VR headset, the Apple Vision Pro, priced at $3,499. The headset includes a new system called \u201cAdaptive Sync\u201d and has a screen resolution of 23 million pixels, as well as spatial audio and microphone. The company suggests it can virtually replace televisions and computer monitors for many people. Although the Apple Vision Pro is designed primarily for use with Mac hardware, it can also be used with the company\u2019s other devices and other brands of PCs. Some have criticized the product, stating that social pressures would make users appear ill-advised for wearing a bulky headset. Others, however, hail the device as a possible game-changer that captures Apple's unique design and innovation perspectives, despite a high price point.Apple's newly released mixed-reality headset has garnered mixed reviews from users. Some criticize its design and its potential for spatial interface, arguing that it is not yet worth the $3500 price tag. However, others see the potential for immersive experiences in virtual and augmented reality, including group movie viewing and enhanced medical procedures. The device's high resolution is suitable for 3D movies, and users can manipulate the virtual space to create the ideal environment for both work and entertainment. The headset may not be disrupting the market as much as anticipated, with the high price point signaling it is still geared towards executives rather than a mass market audience.The comments section discusses the limitations of current immersive tech, such as discomfort, battery life, and bulkiness, yet also explores potential use cases for augmented reality, including home decoration, watching movies alone, and virtual workspaces. One user recommends the novel 'Warcross' as an example of a potential future where augmented reality is prevalent. The discussion also touches on concerns about long-term effects on eye health and whether Apple could make a push into the gaming market with its latest headset technology.Apple's new AR headset, Apple Vision, has generated mixed reactions from the tech community, with some pointing out that photos and movies are typically viewed with others, while others suggest the device could have potential use cases in gaming and manufacturing. The headset also features eye display technology that allows wearers to maintain awareness of their surroundings while using the device. However, some question whether people will be willing to wear a headset for extended periods of time. The device is being described as a \"pro\" product, aimed at developers and early adopters. Apple has partnered with Unity to develop games for the device. Critics note that the AR/VR market has yet to find its killer app.Apple's release of a new VR/AR headset has generated mixed reactions from consumers and analysts alike. While some see potential use cases in fields such as remote work and simulations, others question the practicality of using a bulky headset for everyday activities like watching movies or browsing vacation photos. The device's high price point and limited battery life are also concerns. However, many are optimistic about the potential for advancements in the VR/AR space in the coming years and the impact it could have on the way we interact with technology. Despite Apple's historical lack of interest in gaming, some believe that the company's new headset could potentially be successful in that market if developer tools are easy to use and better than the competition.Apple's new VR headset has limitations, discomfort, and potential side effects like motion sickness, but the company aims to attract wealthy consumers with its \"wow\" factor. The headset offers a solo experience with limited capability for sharing. The price point of $3.5K is seen as reasonable for those with disposable income. The device is locked behind Apple's walled garden, prompting competition from companies like Microsoft to offer more open options. The adult entertainment industry is expected to use the technology for new experiences. However, some are skeptical about AR/VR technology's usefulness and quality, and Meta's offerings are seen as more affordable and better controllers for gaming. The experience of interacting with the headset is believed to be a seated one in a controlled environment.",

    "content": "The U.S. Patent Office has proposed new rules about who can challenge wrongly granted patents. If the rules become official, they will offer new protections to patent trolls. Challenging patents will become far more onerous, and impossible for some. The new rules could stop organizations like EFF, which used this process to fight the Personal Audio \u201cpodcasting patent,\u201d from filing patent challenges altogether. If you have a personal experience with patent troll attacks, please mention it. Comments are not anonymous and you should use your real name. TAKE ACTIONTELL USPTO TO WORK FOR THE PUBLIC, NOT PATENT TROLLSWe need EFF supporters to speak out against this proposal, which is a gift for patent trolls. We\u2019re asking supporters who care about a fair patent system to file comments using the federal government\u2019s public comment system. Your comments don\u2019t need to be long, or use fancy legalese. The important thing is that everyday users and creators of technology get a chance to state their opposition to these rules.Below this paragraph you can see a simple proposed comment you can cut-and-paste to express your opposition to the rules. It's even better if you add one sentence or more to the comment, especially if you can mention your own experience with the patent system. Of course, you can also write your own original comment. Sample comment: I am opposed to the USPTO\u2019s proposed rules changes for inter partes review (IPR) and other patent challenges. These proposed rules should be withdrawn, and the IPR process should remain open to all. The USPTO should follow the rules Congress set out, and consider all patent challenges, including IPR petitions, on their merits. IPR Is The Best Process For Limiting Bad PatentsThe Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, is one of the only places in the nation where patent trolls can be held to account for the outrageous and harmful claims they make in their patents. Congress created the \u201cinter partes review\u201d (IPR) process, which is overseen by specialized PTAB judges, more than a decade ago. \u201cInter partes\u201d simply means \u201cbetween the parties,\u201d and the IPR process allows members of the public to challenge patents that never should have been granted in the first place. The IPR process is one of two main ways to challenge patents, along with challenging them in district court. The big difference is that the IPR process, while not simple or cheap, is much faster and cheaper than going to trial in federal court. Invalidating a patent in court can cost millions of dollars, while even a complicated IPR process costs a fraction of that. Through IPR, thousands of patents have been thrown out. The patent challengers who have kicked out some of these wrongly-granted monopolies have protected not just themselves, but countless other hobbyists, software developers, small businesses, and nonprofits, who could no longer be threatened with some of the worst patents to slip through the cracks. A patent troll called WordLogic tried to shake down Wikipedia for $30,000. Once PTAB gave its initial ruling\u2014that WordLogic\u2019s patent was likely invalid\u2014WordLogic got smart and settled the case. The lawsuits WordLogic was pushing against Wikipedia, and many other organizations, were dropped. A patent troll called SportBrain Holdings sued more than 80 companies on a patent they said covered getting user data, then sharing it over a network and providing feedback. The patent did not hold up to serious analysis. When a panel of PTAB judges looked at it, they canceled all claims. SportBrain was challenged by Unified Patents, a membership-based for-profit company that will be explicitly banned if the USPTO enacts these troll-friendly rules. Shipping and Transit LLC (formerly Arrivalstar) filed for bankruptcy in 2018 after more than a decade of litigation and 500 patent lawsuits. Shipping and Transit sued a vast array of retailers and shippers, claiming its patents covered almost any type of delivery notification. In its court filings, it valued its own portfolio of 34 U.S. patents at $1. IPR filings against Shipping and Transit, together with court fee orders, were a critical part of ending this onslaught against small business. The IPR process hasn\u2019t eliminated patent trolling. But it\u2019s been so effective that patent trolls and their pro-patent protectors absolutely hate the process. That\u2019s why they are pushed so hard for these proposed rules, and are celebrating their arrival. The Proposed Rules Deliberately Sabotage The IPR SystemUSPTO Director Kathi Vidal has already tried to walk back responsibility for these rules. She said in Congress last month that the rules \u201cgiving stakeholders a chance to shape the rules.\u201d But the only \u201cstakeholders\u201d who seem to have had a hand here are patent trolls and large patent-holders.Many patent trolls would be exempt from IPRs altogether. The USPTO would prohibit anyone from challenging the patents of \u201csmall entities\u201d and \u201cunder-resourced inventors.\u201d But it\u2019s trivially easy for even the most litigious patent trolls to portray themselves as \u201csmall inventors.\u201d It happens all the time, and the USPTO rules buy into this sham. Many \u201cinventors\u201d are patent attorneys who have learned to game the system; they haven\u2019t invented anything other than patents. Patent trolls that have sued hundreds of small businesses, and even public transportation systems, including Shipping and Transit LLC and various Leigh Rothschild entities, have claimed to be \u201cinventor owned\u201d businesses. If these rules were in force, it\u2019s not clear that EFF would have been able to protect the podcasting community by fighting, and ultimately winning, a patent challenge against Personal Audio LLC. Personal Audio claimed to be an inventor-owned company that was ready to charge patent royalties against podcasters large and small. EFF crowd-funded a patent challenge and took out the Personal Audio patent after a 5-year legal battle (that included a full IPR process and multiple appeals). TAKE ACTIONWE HAVE A RIGHT TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST PATENT TROLLINGThe Idea That People Challenging Patents Are Abusing The System Is AbsurdThe rules create an upside-down world in which people who work to challenge patents are treated as the abusers of the system, rather than the patent trolls they\u2019re up against. For instance, the rules would punish groups that file \u201cserial petitions\u201d or \u201cparallel petitions\u201d by simply denying them access to the PTAB. It also creates new rules denying petitions \u201cto ensure that certain for-profit entities do not use the [] processes in ways that do not advance the mission and vision of the Office to promote innovation.\u201d But it\u2019s the patent office\u2019s own wrongly granted patents\u2014each one a 20-year government-granted monopoly\u2014that often inhibit innovation. USPTO patents have allowed business models like Lodsys, the company that sent out hundreds of threats to small app developers demanding royalties for using basic, off-the-shelf in-app payment systems. The office has done nothing to rein in patent trolls; but now that there\u2019s a system that can occasionally challenge them. This is wrong. It\u2019s in the public interest to challenge patents and test which ones are wrongly granted. All properly timed and filed patent challenges should be heard on the merits, whether they are filed by for-profits, non-profits, large entities or individuals. That\u2019s what Congress envisioned when it created the patent challenge process. The Rules Are A Direct Attempt By USPTO To Overturn Congress\u2019s Power The IPR process was created by Congress in 2013 to resolve certain patent disputes more quickly and efficiently than courts could. When evidence is presented that there is \u201cprior art,\u201d or previously existing technology, that should have prevented the patent from issuing, the IPR process allows for a relatively quick quasi-judicial process that can result in patent claims being revoked. The IPR process was created after a long debate by elected representatives. If Congress wants to change the system, they\u2019re able to do so. But USPTO officials must not be allowed to cripple patent challenges from the inside. As USPTO\u2019s own statistics point out, it\u2019s actually a tiny sliver of \u201clive\u201d patents that are even challenged, much less invalidated. In the last fiscal year, the USPTO partly invalidated 350 patents. Compare that to the 300,000 patent grants USPTO is handing out every year. The U.S. patent system remains wildly imbalanced\u2014in favor of patent owners, not patent challengers. These proposed rules show that USPTO has it backwards. Please join us and speak out through the public comment process. No one should tolerate a patent troll takeover at PTAB. TAKE ACTIONTELL USPTO TO WORK FOR THE PUBLIC, NOT PATENT TROLLS",

The EFF believes that challenge tests should be open to all, without limitation, as it is beneficial to the public. EFF only filed one IPR ever, which was crowd-funded by hundreds of people. Patent challenges should be open to all, regardless of whether they are for-profit or not.

The discussion mentions the potential for increased secrecy if patents were abolished and the importance of adequate funding for medical research and drug trials. There is also a brief discussion about the impact of patent protection on board game design and a reference to a patent infringement lawsuit involving a board game.Eli Lilly has lowered the price of its insulin by 70% and set a cap of $35 per patient. However, this does not change the fact that the company is still making a profit. Insulin makers admitted during a 2019 hearing that there is pressure to keep list prices high to benefit pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). PBMs prioritize drugs that provide them with higher profits. Eli Lilly risks being excluded from insurance formularies if they lower prices, resulting in patients losing insurance coverage for their product. Patents are a necessary requirement when applying for some government grants, such as a Canadian tech grant. Patent filings are required for defense-related tech when funded by DARPA. EU law only excludes patents for \"software as such,\" but inventions implemented primarily in software can still be patented in the context of an industrial or consumer application. The US does not allow software patents as of 2014, except for those with physical effects on the world.The debate over software patents and their usefulness continues: some argue that they are harmful, prevent innovation and encourage monopolies, while others believe that they incentivize technological progress. The US Patent and Trademark Office has suggested new rules to reduce the burden on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Critics, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), argue that the rules benefit large corporations and patent trolls, limit the ability of third parties to challenge patents and reduce transparency. Some commenters point out that while patents may be obvious in hindsight, the challenge is in coming up with the ideas in the first place. The importance of patents varies depending on the field and the stage of development, and while some patents may be novel and not obvious, others are considered unnecessary and ridiculous.The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has raised objections to a proposed rule change by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that could limit the ability of third parties to challenge patents it deems as frivolous\u00a0if they are for-profit entities and not currently in a litigation process. The EFF argues that the move is in effect an attempt to protect patent trolls. Critics have pointed out that\u00a0the limitations could have a chilling effect on the calling out of spurious patents that could affect innovation in the future. Some have also noted that\u00a0the USPTO is a demand-driven, fee-funded, and performance-based organization\u00a0and as such\u00a0that it has a financial interest in keeping patent applications flowing.\u00a0\n- Patent trolls make a lot of money and companies often don't fight patents until they get sued, so preemptive invalidation is preferred but too expensive.\n- More memory channels could be beneficial, but adding them to a motherboard can be costly for everyone.\n- Cashless USD is becoming a reality and could have an impact on wage-based economies.\n- The EFF's stance on patent holders is unclear.\n- Patents may need to be evaluated and adjusted based on technological pace and the value of the product they protect.",
    "hn_summary": "- The USPTO is attempting to limit IPRs for invalidating patents without protection domains, which the EFF believes will limit challenges to patents that should be open to all.\n- Patent challenges should be open to all, regardless of for-profit or non-profit status, as organizations of all sizes are protected by challenges from others.\n- The suggested USPTO rule change to limit third-party challenges to frivolous patents deemed non-litigious could have a chilling effect on innovation, according to critics."

    "hn_content": "A discussion on the limitations and merits of Rust programming language, particularly its approach to async functions and function coloring. \n\nSome users express reservations about Rust's async functions and consider it hacky and complicated, causing the language to lose some of its elegance. Others cite its benefits, including an easier time running code in multiple threads of execution.\n\nFunction coloring is also a topic of discussion, with some users pointing out the importance of knowing how a given function behaves and calling it safely without causing errors or bugs. \n\nThe conversation also touches on the merits of virtual threads, like Java's Loom, as an alternative to Rust's async functions. \n\nSome users mention the possibility of an effects system, wherein a function is marked with certain effects like touching the disk or network, making it easier to determine how the function should behave in the context of a given project.The thread begins with a discussion on whether or not functions should be marked as async or blocking. It's argued that async functions tell developers valuable information about a function's behavior which can be helpful in IDEs, but some argue that blocking has meaning in more contexts. The thread then moves on to talk about Project Loom and Kotlin's suspend funs, which are used to signal when a function will interact with the network or disk. There is also a discussion about blocking code in different languages. Finally, there is a critique of async/await as a language feature and how it can complicate the mental model.The discussion on async/await revolves around its primary use for handling callback code and automatic function splitting in asynchronous tasks. The design can be intuitive and easy to grasp, but it requires considerable mental gymnastics for reasoning about sequential processes in code. The coding model can mark async functions like sockets send that require non-blocking code execution, ensuring that functions are pure and unit testable. The functionality brings about the concept of IO and function purity to the type system. The async technology is only useful in some contexts, and not an overall panacea for all situations. Although popularized by JavaScript, async/await's use has proliferated in different languages, creating the need to segregate code into async and non-async functions.Developers discuss the Rust programming language and its asynchronous functionality, debating whether it's a positive addition or not. The discussion also turns to Rust's lack of higher-kinded types and whether it will ever include them. Other languages, such as Nim and OCaml, are mentioned and compared to Rust. The conversation also touches on the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 and the potential reasons for it going poorly. The importance of aligned authority, responsibility, and competence in successful endeavors is also mentioned. Overall, the discussion delves into various programming language features and their implications.Developers are discussing the use of `async` in Rust, with some arguing that it is a \"conceptual mistake\" to view `async` as a special abstraction. Others argue that `Result`-based error handling adds significant friction to Rust. Meanwhile, there are debates over the handling of containers, iteration, and smart pointers. Some argue that such features should be compiler built-ins, while others believe they should be written in the library. Overall, the discussions reveal the importance of balancing language complexity and expressivity while prioritizing safety and performance.Rust will refuse to compile code that does not explicitly handle cases. Using Rust's Option, it is easy to deal with empty vectors, and the compiler ensures that users don't access invalid values. Rust offers a lot of benefits for web development, such as compiled vs. interpreted code, strong typing and dependency management, but lacks a good web app framework. Rust positions itself as a C++ alternative and is suitable as a C++ replacement for web apps that require complex memory handling and performance. Rust's Option type is cheap, making safety more affordable. Other options for web development include .NET, JVM, Go, Python, Ruby, node.js, and PHP. Rust is a young language, and Rust packages for basic back-end web stuff for Enterprise use are rock solid. Dependency management in Rust is best in class, but there is no crate namespaces feature for ownership verification.The post discusses various programming languages and their features, with a particular focus on Rust. Some commenters express preferences for different languages, such as Go or F#. Others mention issues with Rust's borrow checker and lifetime management. There is also some discussion around the original vision for Rust as a more ML-like language. The article does not seem to relate to any specific new or exciting development in the industry, but rather provides a forum for discussion among developers about different languages and their strengths and weaknesses.Developers discuss the tooling and runtimes associated with C#, OCaml, and other languages, with some praising C# for easy, enterprise distribution, while others criticize it for being too reliant on OOP. Some comments focus on lowering build-test-debug cycle times while others debate the merits of various features and tooling. Additionally, some comments discuss upcoming features in languages like ASP.NET and .NET 8, and others provide information about new languages like Roc and Inko. Finally, some commenters express frustration with stagnant tooling in existing languages like OCaml.The post discusses using multiple compile units, shared generics, and lld in Rust programming. The commentator suggests that using shared generics may be a nightly-only feature. Lld is recommended for big projects. In C++, small changes to a header can result in having to rebuild thousands of different files. A specific header file included can add .5 seconds of compilation time. Boilerplate code constructs can also add .1 seconds to the time to compile a file. Overall, the post provides insights on optimizing large-scale builds and compile times in Rust and C++ programming languages.",

One moderator's account was locked by Reddit for \"suspicious activity\" after adding their subreddits to the protest list, and their posts and comments were subsequently deleted. Some commentators describe this exercise of power as an online version of labor disputes, with management testing the power wielded by the moderators. The moderators, who are essentially volunteers, are testing their power by taking industrial action, and it remains to be seen how much power they will prove to have.The comments on this post revolve around Reddit's moderation system and potential problems with a centralized platform. Some users suggest that a decentralized alternative could be a solution. One user shares that they have been researching the connection between Reddit post type and comment structure for a thesis. Data from the entire history of Reddit from 2005-06 until 2022-12 is available on torrents for further analysis, and one user plans on publicly sharing their thesis in 1.5 months. However, comments appear to be mostly speculative and opinion-based with little factual information.The new policies of Reddit around third-party apps are leading to hostility from users and may cause a loss of meaningful users from the platform. Some users have left due to the toxicity and hostility of the community, while others are looking for alternatives like Lemmy, a federated Reddit clone. Reddit's management is speculated to be making decisions on the fly without measuring anything, while others suggest that Reddit may be choosing to anger some parts of their community deliberately. Reddit may be relying on improved advertising metrics before an IPO, but it remains unclear as to whether this will outweigh the fallout from the new policies. Some users suggest that a paid tier for API access would be a compromise, or that people would be willing to pay for a good service with reasonable moderation.

Former leaders of the company accuse it of operating an unlicensed securities exchange in the US while using encrypted messages to discuss their activities. Critics note that Binance may not cooperate with the SEC's legal action.The post discusses the risks of putting things in writing, as it leaves a paper trail that can be used against individuals or companies in legal cases. The conversation also covers the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the process of requesting written communications of government officials, as well as cost and exemptions.

The post highlights the need for caution when communicating online and the risks and consequences of leaving a paper trail admitting to crimes.The post discusses the differences between the common law and civil law systems. Common law is based on contracts, agreements and negotiations, and can be interpreted by judges, encouraging negotiation. In contrast, civil law is based on democratic parliamentary authority and outlines crimes and punishments, with no room for negotiation. The post argues that the Anglo-American legal system encourages lying and denying to negotiate for better outcomes, which is not the case in civil law. However, the accuracy of some of the details in the post is questionable, including the use of the term \"Anglosaxon,\" the idea that the entire rest of the world uses the civil law system, and the claim that contracts do not exist in civil law.The post discusses the supremacy of the law over any contractual agreement made between parties and the differences between civil law and common law.

The comment section includes debates and opinions about the use and potential of cryptocurrency in the global economy, as well as the nature of the legal and regulatory environment surrounding the industry. Overall, there is no significant new or exciting development covered in this post.System D refers to the informal economy and the underground economy, which has a projected GDP of $10 trillion. The debate over whether cryptocurrencies are commodities, securities or currencies continues, with some arguing that \"everything is a security.\" While most people buy crypto with the expectation of making a profit, people also use it for funds transfer and as a cash alternative in countries with mismanaged currencies. Governments and other organizations are grappling with the potential risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies, and El Salvador is a clear outlier in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. However, the idea that BTC could replace fiat currency for tax payment is deemed \"suicidal\" given a nation\u2019s economic autonomy.The legality of securities in crypto is a contentious topic due to the lack of clear definitions offered by the SEC. While the Howey test offers a relatively clear definition of securities, some argue that the application of the test to cryptocurrency is insufficient. Binance is being sued by the CFTC for alleged violations of securities laws in relation to its Bitcoin and Ethereum trading, while Coinbase is being sued for its staking services. ChatGPT and AI models should be taken with caution when discussing financial securities as they are subject to errors, bias, and outdated information. Lastly, while subjective, many believe that almost every cryptocurrency/coin classifies as a security.The SEC has filed a lawsuit against Binance, alleging that the company mixed billions of dollars in customer funds and secretly sent them to a separate company controlled by its founder, Changpeng Zhao, resulting in a criminal offense. The lawsuit shows the structure of Zhao's companies and how Binance operates. The case raises the issue of financial modernization within the US and banks' power. While some acknowledge problems in the financial system, others argue against the blanket ban of experimentation with new systems before authorities explain and demonstrate the technology's benefits.US banks may not be capable of providing quick, low-cost domestic wire transfers like their counterparts in other countries. Banks in Singapore, NZ, and Australia provide inter-bank settlements within minutes, while international money transfer services are not subject to AML, KYC and other checks that slow bank transfers down. Innovation in finance is not always good and the financial system is hesitant to deal with cryptocurrencies.

Six strategies for better results include writing clear instructions, providing reference text, splitting complex tasks, giving GPTs time to \"think\", using external tools, and testing changes systematically. Examples of tactics to achieve these strategies are also provided, such as using delimiters to indicate distinct parts of the input and specifying the desired length of the output. The post emphasizes the importance of providing context and details, and how to use embeddings for efficient knowledge retrieval. Finally, the post provides examples of how to apply these tactics to specific tasks.OpenAI suggests several tactics and strategies to improve the performance of language models, including instructing the model to reason from first principles before coming to a conclusion, using inner monologue to hide the model's reasoning process, testing changes systematically, evaluating model outputs with reference to gold-standard answers, and using external tools such as embeddings-based search and code execution. One tactic for testing changes systematically is to use good evals, which are representative of real-world usage and contain many test cases; OpenAI Evals is an open-source software framework that provides tools for creating automated evals. Another strategy is to use embeddings-based search to implement efficient knowledge retrieval, and code execution to perform more accurate calculations or call external APIs. Lastly, evaluation of outputs can be done by computers, humans or a mix.- Neil Armstrong's iconic quote upon his first step on the lunar surface is still widely quoted today.\n- Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon on July 21, 1969, marking a monumental achievement in human history.\n- This historic event took place during the Apollo 11 mission.",

    "hn_content": "Sandstorm, an open-source platform for self-hosting web apps, offers a capability-based security model that isolates individual documents for each user, provides granular access control, and enforces that each document can only be accessed by the people with whom it has been shared. The downsides include the amount of effort required to update and integrate apps with centralized authorization framework. While packaging apps for Sandstorm is a bad idea, Sandstorm-native apps are more comfortable and quicker to make and maintain. Sandstorm is more secure than other self-hosting tools like Yunohost and Cloudron and is suitable for people who prefer higher security and tighter control over their web apps. While it is not as popular as other self-hosting services, Sandstorm's UX model is similar to the future of self-hosting, where installing apps is as easy as installing an app on your phone.Sandstorm is a self-hosting platform for third-party apps that simplifies the process of hosting and sharing. It offers several benefits, including independent authentication, easy sharing, and enabling creating collections comprising documents made with different applications, which can be shared with one link. Although Sandstorm requires aggressive app packaging work, it is still a good option for people new to the industry. Other self-hosting platforms, like Umbrel and YunoHost, also exist but are not as secure as Sandstorm due to their lack of isolation. While the use of Cap'n Proto protocol for inter-language IPC has many benefits, its adoption is limited due to the lack of proper support for most programming languages.A recent update generated buzz in the Sandstorm open-source collaborative software project, which has been stagnant since the collapse of its parent company. It is a self-hosting technology paradigm that delivers storage and running functions to server resources. The introduction of Tempest, an alternative to Sandstorm, has generated significant attention. Currently, Tempest runs many Sandstorm apps, but there is still much to be developed before it can replace Sandstorm servers. However, it's architecturally different from Sandstorm in fundamental ways that make it easier to implement new features. The project is open source and designed to be user-friendly, with a back-end powered by entirely open-source technology like PostgreSQL and Nginx. Contributions from app packaging to UI/UX enhancements are welcome. Other collaborative software packages mentioned in the post include Cloudron and Umbrel.",

    "hn_content": "Apple has unveiled its new Mac Studio, which features Apple Silicon and advanced machine learning (ML) capabilities, resulting in increased performance, power efficiency and user interface improvements. During its WWDC keynote, Apple demonstrated the Mac Studio's advanced language models (LMs) and transformer model, which are highly capable in performing sequential predictions based on their previous answers. The presentation also featured technical terms, for example, \"transformer model\", without using buzzwords such as AI. The use of highly technical terminology in the keynote is an effort to fight against the common notion that AI implies sentient, thinking machines.This post discusses the use of AI in video games and how it relates to pre-programmed versus machine learning models. The concept of AI in gaming has a long history, and the discussion centers around NPCs' behavior and the way they respond to in-game events through programmed or machine-learned behaviors. The writers also reference Apple's latest Mac Pro, which has received varied feedback from potential consumers due to its high price point and specific use case. The post also touches on the difference between ML and AI and how they are being used in various fields. Finally, the article mentions specific hardware like the HP Z6 G5 that users might compare to the Mac Pro.Apple's decision to use integrated memory in their latest Mac Pro design has stirred up some discussion. While some are curious to see if expansion via PCIe will be enough for the Max Pro market, others believe that the design is sufficient for video production and related markets. However, the 192GB of shared memory falls short in comparison to the 1.5TB of RAM available on the \"old\" Mac Pro, which may leave some users disappointed. Some users suggest using a PCIe card loaded with DRAM or adapting to NVMe drives, though there may be minor OS and app compatibility issues. The design decision may also limit the Mac Pro's ability to train models. Nonetheless, the M2 chips' increased bandwidth seems to compensate for the lower amount of RAM in certain use cases.Apple's M1 Max chip offers faster RAM connection than many servers and allows for customizable memory bandwidth options. There is a debate over the trade-offs between shared memory bandwidth and CPU-bound or GPU-bound tasks. The new chip enables feasible desktop training and running of large AI models. Apple has completed another successfully seamless migration to a new architecture for its customer base and developers. The Mac Studio targets a larger number of professionals, while the Mac Pro caters to a more niche high-end market. However, some people are disappointed that the Pro model offers zero extra performance, no upgradeability for the GPU, and a bunch of useless PCI slots. The new Apple chip offers lower memory bandwidth compared to discrete GPUs from Intel or AMD and NVIDIA.Apple has released a new version of the Mac Pro with an M2 Ultra chip, a move some believe marks \"a funeral for this product\". The Ultra has a 200W TDP and supports 192GB of unified RAM, while the machine is based around the Mac Studio model. However, some users baulked at the price of the latest device compared to the Mac Studio, which they say offers close to the same functionality.\n- Apple's new Mac Pro features multiple processors and shared memory access solved in OS\n- External GPU support may be limited to PCI and not expanded to TB4\n- The Mac Pro can run up to 3 8k60 displays and 6 6k60 displays\n- The Mac Pro uses chiplets and interconnect technology for improved performance\n- The M2 chip has an internal media engine that replaces dedicated Afterburner cards\n- The Mac Studio with the M1 chip has disappeared from the Apple website\n- The Mac Pro may not be worth the price for those who do not need macOS + PCIe combo\n- Upgrading to the new Mac Pro may not be necessary for those who own the previous version\n- The market share for Apple CPUs remains within historical ranges\n- The new Mac Pro may not support GPUs in PCIe slots due to Apple Silicon architecture display limitations.",
