XB-1 provides the foundation for Boom’s supersonic airliner, Overture. Today, Boom announced the successful flight of XB-1, the world’s first independently developed supersonic jet, at the Mojave Air & Space Port in Mojave, California. Like Overture, Boom’s supersonic airliner, XB-1 leverages state-of-the-art technologies to enable efficient supersonic flight including carbon fiber composites, advanced avionics, digitally-optimized aerodynamics, and an advanced supersonic propulsion system.

Flown by Chief Test Pilot Bill “Doc” Shoemaker, XB-1 took off from the Mojave Air & Space Port and flew in the same airspace that hosted many historic first flights, including the flights of the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, and the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. “Everyone on the XB-1 team should be incredibly proud of this achievement,” said Bill “Doc” Shoemaker, Chief Test Pilot for Boom Supersonic. “It has been a privilege to share this journey with so many dedicated and talented professionals. The experience we have gained in reaching this milestone will be invaluable to Boom’s revival of supersonic travel.” Test Pilot Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenburg flew the T-38 chase aircraft which monitored XB-1 in the air. Chase planes accompany new aircraft on their maiden flights to observe how the test plane is handling and verify things like altitude, airspeed, and airworthiness during flight. “Being in the air with XB-1 during its maiden flight is a moment I will never forget,” said Boom Test Pilot Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenburg. “The team has been working hard to get to this point, and seeing today’s flight through mission completion is a huge accomplishment for all of us.” XB-1 met all of its test objectives, including safely and successfully achieving an altitude of 7,120 feet and speeds up to 238 knots (273 mph). While XB-1 was in the air, the team performed an initial assessment of the aircraft’s handling qualities, including airspeed checks with the T-38 chase aircraft, and assessing the aircraft’s stability in the landing attitude (at a high angle of attack). XB-1 is 62.6 feet long with a wingspan of 21 feet and is powered by three GE J85-15 engines with a combined max thrust of 12,300 pounds of force (lbf) Two decades after Concorde’s retirement, the first flight of XB-1 marks the return of a civil supersonic aircraft to the skies and paves the way for the revival of mainstream supersonic travel onboard Overture, Boom’s sustainable supersonic airliner. XB-1 touches down after its maiden flight. “I’ve been waiting over 20 years for an environmentally friendly successor to Concorde and XB-1’s first flight is a major landmark towards my dreams being realized. When I last flew Concorde in 2003 I knew that this day would come. The first flight of the XB-1 supersonic demonstrator is a significant achievement toward making sustainable supersonic flight a reality, aboard Overture – my #1 choice as the successor to Concorde,” said Captain Mike Bannister, former Chief Concorde Pilot for British Airways. “Congratulations to Blake Scholl, all at Boom and especially its pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker. Having been Concorde’s Chief Pilot I envy his role in this exciting return towards mainstream supersonic flight.” The XB-1 program provides the foundation for Overture’s design and development, while establishing a safety-first culture in engineering and manufacturing. XB-1 validates key technologies and Boom’s own innovations, including: Augmented reality vision system: Two nose-mounted cameras, digitally augmented with attitude and flight path indications, feed a high resolution pilot display enabling excellent runway visibility. This system enables improved aerodynamic efficiency without the weight and complexity of a movable nose. Digitally-optimized aerodynamics: Engineers used computational fluid dynamics simulations to explore thousands of designs for XB-1. The result is an optimized design that combines safe and stable operation at takeoff and landing with efficiency at supersonic speeds. Carbon fiber composites: XB-1 is almost entirely made from carbon fiber composite materials, enabling it to realize a sophisticated aerodynamic design in a strong, lightweight structure. Supersonic intakes: XB-1’s engine intakes slow supersonic air to subsonic speeds, efficiently converting kinetic energy into pressure energy, allowing conventional jet engines to power XB-1 from takeoff through supersonic flight. “Boom Supersonic is the first civil business entity to create its own X-plane, a supersonic demonstrator,” said Ric Parker, Chair of Singapore Aerospace Programme, former Rolls-Royce CTO and Boom Advisory Council member. “This milestone is on the critical path to deliver Overture, the first supersonic transport aircraft to enter service in over half a century. It is such an exciting time to be involved!” It is fitting that XB-1 took off for the first time from the Mojave Air & Space Port, in airspace known as the home of many firsts in the world of aviation and aerospace. This region in the Mojave Desert is the proving grounds for the aerospace industry, where an aircraft broke the sound barrier for the first time in 1947 and where speed and altitude records are set. Now that XB-1 has successfully completed its first flight, the team will systematically expand the flight envelope to confirm its performance and handling qualities through and beyond Mach 1. When XB-1 is ready for its first supersonic flight, Test Pilot Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenberg will be at the controls. The inaugural flight of XB-1 takes place as Overture continues to advance toward production, with a growing global network of Tier 1 suppliers and an order book including 130 orders and pre-orders from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. “Congratulations to Boom on the XB-1’s first flight,” said Akasaka Yuji, Representative Director, CEO Japan Airlines. “I am looking forward to seeing your realization of sustainable supersonic flight to and from Japan.” Overture will carry 64-80 passengers at Mach 1.7, about twice the speed of today’s subsonic airliners. Optimized for speed, safety, and sustainability, Overture is designed to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). “Boom Supersonic’s remarkable achievements are a testament to the power of dreaming and doing,” said Amy Spowart, President & CEO of The National Aeronautical Association. “Like Sir Frank Whittle, Blake, and Boom, achieved what others tried and no other could with XB-1. Congratulations to the XB-1 team, including Chief Test Pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker! The National Aeronautic Association looks forward to celebrating your milestones in the historic fashion of the shoulders on which we all stand.” STAY UP TO SPEED Subscribe to the newsletter for Boom news and insights straight to your inbox.

It's a composite of weeks of takes. Also, the airliner may be glass screen cockpit on screens. This one had eyeballs to the sky. reply tjohns 4 hours agoparent> Also, the airliner may be glass screen cockpit on screens. This one had eyeballs to the sky. I'm not sure what you're getting at with this? The pilot had all glass avionics here. Other than the lack of an FMS (which is just never used in small aircraft), this had everything I'd expect to see in modern systems. But also, even in an aircraft with a glass cockpit, the pilot is supposed to be mostly eyes up. Unless you're inside inclement weather, aviation operates on the \"see and avoid\" principle. Especially so when you're flying low and in congested airspace like the Mojave MOAs. reply ggm 3 hours agorootparentThe airliner as described won't have windows for the pilot, it will be rendered on a screen. reply resolutebat 5 hours agoparentprevThe flight pretty much consisted of taking off, turning around and landing, it would be pretty boring if they just showed that. In particular, this didn't go even close to supersonic, this time. reply class3shock 14 hours agoprevFrom wiki: \"On June 3, 2021, United Airlines announced they had signed an agreement to purchase 15 Overture aircraft with an additional 35 options, expecting to start passenger flights by 2029.[14][15] On August 16, 2022, American Airlines announced an agreement to purchase 20 Overture aircraft with an additional 40 options.[16]\" later on... \"On December 13, 2022, Boom announced that it would develop its own turbofan engine after \"Big Three\" engine manufacturers Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric, as well as CFM and Safran previously declined to develop a new engine due to high capital costs.[29][30][31][32] Named Symphony, (see § Engines below) the engine will be developed under partnership with three entities: Kratos subsidiary Florida Turbine Technologies for engine design; StandardAero for maintenance; and General Electric subsidiary GE Additive for consulting on printing components.[33]\" So not only do they think they are going to finish designing, prototyping, testing, certifying, and moving to production an entirely new aircraft, they also think they are going to design a brand new engine, that the big three didn't think made sense and also get it through all those efforts? All in the next 5 years? If it doesn't come to anything, which seems likely, atleast it sounds like a fun way to spend lots of money. reply Robotbeat 8 hours agoparentNote that SpaceX did this. They developed their own engines (altho initial 5 flights did get a 3rd party built turbopump, analogous to XB-1, I suppose), developed their own highly vertically integrated rocket, and offered launch services. Now, RocketLab does the same and they’re being joined by Firefly, Blue Origin, and Relativity, all being at least F9-level reusable eventually. Everyone takes for granted launch vehicles being “easier” than airliners now, but go back to the 1990s and the attitude would’ve been switched (PARTICULARLY high-rate and economic reusable launch vehicles, which were considered virtually unattainable). I think it’s totally doable to make both an airliner and an engine, and the main reason we don’t think so is successful PR by old aerospace primes. reply class3shock 6 hours agorootparentFirst, to certify a new aircraft takes 5-9 years (source below). https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/airworthiness_certific... Lets say they are really good and they are ready to test fly in 3 years to meet that 5 year goal (which I'll tell you right now is not happening), they still need engines. 3 years to design, develop, and build a clean sheet engine. It took GE and Safran (CFM) 10 years between the announcement of the LEAP and its certification: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFM_International_LEAP So no, it is quite unlikely that a company with no experience in commercial jet engines (Florida Turbines, subsidiary of Kratos) will be able to field the equivalent of a modern day concord engine in 3 years. I would say the main reason people think it could be is successful PR from new startups. reply dmix 5 hours agorootparentProjections for these projects are always very optimistic. Why are you focusing so heavily on their runway being tied to some ideal date in 2 early contracts they signed? reply remarkEon 4 hours agorootparentprev>and the main reason we don’t think so is successful PR by old aerospace primes. It's partly that, and also partly that making engines successful is a different business. For capital intensive industries, it's natural that they separate and consolidate into specialties, which is why you see things work they way they do today. SpaceX is probably the exception that prove the rule, at least for space access. It would be nice to see Boom become that same exception for passenger jet aircraft. For obvious reasons, given the ongoings with Boeing. reply lobochrome 7 hours agorootparentprevFlying an engine once before a quick refurbish without risking human life isn’t the same as flying an engine for weeks before any significant downtime/maintenance. It’s a very different optimization task. reply woah 7 hours agorootparentprevWhy have China and India been struggling to make jet engines for decades? reply lasre 6 hours agorootparentin the case of India, their engine development project for the HAL Tejas started out with ~50 million USD in 1989 and had a target goal of 5 years. Given that (even after a 650% cost overrun and 30 years) the total engine development cost is still about $400 million USD, that buys about one and a half F-35Bs. Even when picking good and cheap, there’s cheap and then there’s shoestring. reply mlindner 7 hours agorootparentprevLack of an industrial base and native experience in doing so. Once one company does it, the experience gained can spread to other companies via employees moving around and forming suppliers for those same companies. For India it also has the issue of brain drain as any of the people working on India's engines could easily jump ship and move to the UK or the US and get pretty good jobs in our aerospace industries and get paid a whole lot more. Also China does have it's own engines used in its military aircraft. Designing very efficient engines that are also cost efficient is the focus of a lot of those big primes in the US/UK/Europe so competing with them may be difficult, however there is currently no one trying to make very efficient _supersonic_ engines. All supersonic engines are destined for military jets which care a lot more about peak performance as the primary design parameter. In other words there is no one operating in the segment Boom is trying to develop an engine and they can hire a lot of people from the rest of the US industry who already have a lot of experience designing engines or people who were trained by said people. Ironically it may be SpaceX who kills off Boom if they're successful in implementing suborbital long distance passenger travel with Starship, though that's still very much an open question if it's possible. Such travel would, if successful, most likely be way faster and cheaper than supersonic long distance travel because of the reduced losses from drag. reply Already__Taken 1 hour agorootparentI just don't see Starship getting any full commercial use like that on environmental and noise grounds. reply anovikov 3 hours agorootparentprevSpaceX did it but nowhere like on the timelines they have anticipated. They also expected 4 years from start to Falcon 5 flight - which was cancelled and replaced by Falcon 9 eventually - but it took 8 years and then another 3 years before regular flights and another 5 before reusability started to really work. reply hcks 11 hours agoparentprev« It’s never possible to innovate » This is currently the top comment on news.ycombinator.com reply class3shock 10 hours agorootparentIt's always possible to innovate. It just happens that often the people claiming too are mostly innovating at separating people from their money. If you want to chat why I think this is more the later than the former feel free to reach out, I love talking aerospace. reply Karrot_Kream 10 hours agorootparentSo funny thing is you're in a thread about aerospace. If I might hazard a guess, discussing the concrete reasons why you think this is a scam can help educate curious readers about the challenges in this field and can probably start a discussion on the technical details of supersonic aircraft that has less emotional and more technical content. It doesn't always work out that way though shrug. From my own context, the work of certifying the airframe alone takes forever, let alone prototyping another engine and one that requires the thrust requirements a supersonic aircraft needs, so I too am really dubious of the timelines. But I'm curious why you think this is a scam as opposed to general exuberance, or why you think innovation in this space in particular is unlikely. There's other variables here like United's purchase; we all know companies like Theranos have defrauded established players like Walgreens, but do you think United did not do their due diligence here? (I'm also deeply curious on why you feel that high-level criticism of the idea is relevant for this forum but the details of your criticism are not. I feel it'll teach me a lot about what motivates folks to use HN these days, but that's just my own curiosity.) reply class3shock 9 hours agorootparentI wouldn't call it a scam, I think it's like alot of start ups. It looks good, has lots of cool marketing, and \"in theory\" could work. But after a few years of missing deadlines and goals (because they were unrealistic) and eating up money, the \"in theory\" could work turns into \"in practice\" did not. I work in the area so maybe it's just more galling to me hence my snarky response. If by \"innovation in this space\" you mean supersonic commercial air travel, then not really. I could see someone making a couple planes that get bought by the saudi's and a few billionares but if you are talking in terms of eventually reaching all commercial air travel... that's a long way off if ever. Going faster takes you in the wrong direction in terms of efficiency (and thus cost and environmental impact), sound, manufacturability (and thus cost), maintenance (and thus cost), you get the picture. As for United, I'm sure it sounded good at some point to someone. I guess we can check back in 5 years and see how that investment is going. reply remarkEon 4 hours agorootparent>But after a few years of missing deadlines and goals (because they were unrealistic) and eating up money, the \"in theory\" could work turns into \"in practice\" did not. I work in the area so maybe it's just more galling to me hence my snarky response. What are the technical reasons they are behind schedule? Is the physics problem just too difficult, and the problem they've set out to solve just too hard without, idk, government backing? reply class3shock 10 hours agorootparentprevI guess my criticism is high level because, in my mind, the timeframe they market and what they claim to be trying to do in it, is so beyond what is reasonable that touching on simple aspects of the project, such as all the steps they need to go through before getting to their goal, is adequate to highlight unrealistic marketing for what it is. If you look at some of my other answers I go more in depth on specific topics to provide more technical content. If you are curious to learn something more you can always ask? Alot of my posts are questions. Edit: I wrote this and then saw there was more to your post I missed (or got added? maybe I'm having a stroke, do you smell toast?), will respond in below. reply jahewson 10 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not always economical though. When you have the top jet engine manufacturers in the world turning down your business the time has come to ask some tough questions. This is old technology, we know how to do this - what we’ve not figured out is how to make it profitable. There were supposed to be 350 Concorde built but we got 14. Operating an Airline is a brutal business now matter how cool the planes may be. reply ryanwaggoner 9 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not at all what they said. And the history of aerospace is littered with companies that made lofty claims, raised a bunch of money, and eventually went under. When Boom launched eight years ago, they were telling investors they were going to have a prototype flying in two years. For anyone who has any experience in aerospace, this is unrealistic to the point of being fraudulent. People said as much back then [1]. And sure enough, it took eight years, not two. And the actual hard parts are still ahead of them! 99% chance the full-size supersonic aircraft never flies, and 100% chance it won’t be before 2035. 1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11334780 reply Zigurd 10 hours agorootparentprevDelusional project planning kills products and companies. How many years before Starship rockets achieve rapid reuse after being caught by launch tower chopsticks and are reflown quickly enough to supply a yet to be designed and launched orbiting fuel station before the fuel and oxidizer boil off so that Starship can go beyond Earth orbit? The critical path will bite you in the ass especially if your idea of project management comes from software projects. If you pile on enough dependencies, especially on untried concepts, you might not know which possible critical path will bite the hardest. reply namibj 7 hours agorootparentBoil-off can be prevented by loosely wrapping in 50~100 layers of aluminized mylar (\"space blanket\"), adding some solar panels and heat rejection panels, and a 2 or 3 stage refrigerator to keep the contents cold enough to not trigger the boil-off safety overpressure valve. If you're clever with the orientation or possibly with a movable sun shade, you might even get by with just using space as a heat dump, by insulating against the earth and the sun and exposing to empty space to radiate the leakage heat away without a refrigerator. I think they have enough experience with orbital electromechanical design to make this not a problem with much suffering. reply greenthrow 10 hours agorootparentprevSo I can count on you to invest in my new startup that will be inventing human flight without any extraneous equipment right? reply lelandbatey 10 hours agorootparentprevI think this is a grand tradition on this fair site. I think we all are looking forward to whatever's coming next. reply OrwellianChild 14 hours agoparentprevOne dynamic that may be at play: Designing a new engine is a gamble. For a company who already makes money with existing designs, there may be little upside on a small-volume new product. This is likely the reason the \"Big 3\" passed on designing an engine they don't have an off-the-shelf option for. Boom would probably be the primary beneficiary of such an engine existing, so it isn't all that surprising that they will have to fund the development. The second supersonic airframe that can use their engine would be the one to turn that R&D profitable for Boom (and ease the introduction of more supersonic airframe options). reply class3shock 11 hours agorootparentI would agree that the big three didn't think they could make it work, be that for technical reasons, money reasons, limited market reasons, etc. the end result is the same. Where I would disagree is that Boom can make it work. The amount of specialized knowledge you need in design and analysis as well as test and manufacturing facilities makes it near impossible for an outsider get in the game. Which is why there aren't any in the commercial jet engine space. GE, PW, RR and I guess Safran is pretty much it. You can't just decide you are going to do the R&D yourself and pop out a new engine in 5 years. reply imron 11 hours agorootparentSpaceX went from nothing to orbital spacecraft in ~6 years. Plenty of people discounted them at the time too. I’m not saying Boom will succeed, but it’s not outside the realm of possibility if they can dedicate themselves to task the same way SpaceX did. reply arp242 11 hours agorootparentIt took them almost 20 years to do a manned flight though. And that's with professional astronauts knowingly taking the kind of risk you can't do with a passenger aircraft, unless you want to do a OceanGate. That's the tricky bit. I guess they can put something together in that amount of time. But making sure it's safe? More skeptical on that. Look at the recent woes at Boeing for example, and while Boeing's organisational issues are at fault for no small part, it does show all of this is tricky business. Also many other aircraft have had serious design issues, including Concorde. Also not convinced on the economic potential on all of this. There may be also issues with increased noise, environmental impact (possibly via regulations), and things like that. reply class3shock 10 hours agorootparentOr getting it certified that it's safe. https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/airworthiness_certific... \"Amended type certificates typically take 3-5 years to complete. By comparison, the certification of a new aircraft type can take between 5 and 9 years.\" reply Turing_Machine 5 hours agorootparentprev> It took them almost 20 years to do a manned flight though. Given that manned flight occurred in 1903, manned supersonic flight occurred in 1947, and manned spaceflight didn't occur until 1961, it appears that manned spaceflight is considerably more challenging. At this stage, supersonic flight is 77 years old. reply class3shock 10 hours agorootparentprevI think if we were just talking about the airframe I would agree that is was possible. Not the engines though. Look at some of the costs and timeframes involved in one of the big 3's newer engines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_PW1000G Now consider that you aren't starting with existing knowledge base, talent, facilities, etc. (which SpaceX had already started to build up) but from scratch. SpaceX also had nearly a billion in Falcon 9 and Dragon, Boom in its totality looks like it's worth a few hundred million? Lastly SpaceX had 150 employees in 2005 and 1150 in 2010. Boom has 150 and Florida Turbines (the part of Kratos working on this) has 100. All of that is to say they need more money, more people, and more facilities very quickly if they were to have any chance of hitting any of those timeframes. reply imron 9 hours agorootparent> Not the engines though. Look at some of the costs and timeframes involved in one of the big 3's newer engines Compare the cost of rockets when SpaceX started. People laughed SpaceX off too. SpaceX didn't start with an existing knowledge base, talent and facilities either. The idea of starting a rocket company and building reusable rockets was so laughable at the time that they couldn't even hire anyone for the chief engineer (Elon assumed the role because no-one else would do it). In 2002 SpaceX realised it wasn't going to be able to buy an existing engine from the Russians, and decided to make their ownLook at some of the costs and timeframes involved in one of the big 3's newer engines: Look at the cost and timeframes involved in spacecraft made by Boeing, Lockmart, Northrop Grumman and all their pals compared to SpaceX. I'm about 99.99999% sure that there are considerable cost savings to be had in supersonic aircraft as well. reply Alupis 11 hours agorootparentprevThere's significant differences between SpaceX and Boom though. SpaceX got lots of funding because of military/government potential. The US had no domestic capability to place people into orbit. SpaceX also promised cheaper satellite insertion. Boom promises... ultra-wealthy people a few hours shorter flights? Concord failed because of cost - few people could afford the ticket price, and even fewer actually needed to cross the ocean a few hours faster. There's less than zero percent chance Boom will be able to offer cheap \"everyday joe\" prices on their aircraft. It will fail for the same reasons as Concord... reply ricardobeat 8 hours agorootparentFalcon 1 was developed entirely with private funding on a budget of $100M. Only later, as it proved flightworthy, government funding came in. reply yeknoda 7 hours agorootparent100M outright. But billions from the existing knowledge, hired in talent, etc. reply mlindner 7 hours agorootparentSo you're arguing that Boom doesn't have access to existing knowledge? Or that they can't hire in talent? reply imron 9 hours agorootparentprev> Boom promises... ultra-wealthy people a few hours shorter flights? The question I was replying to is not whether they can build a profitable business, but whether they can build their own engine within 5 years. There's a greater than zero percent chance they can do this if they put in the focus and the effort. There's also a greater than zero percent chance that they can build a successful engine and then still go bankrupt. Early SpaceX had funding issues and likely would've gone bankrupt if the 4th launch of the Falcon 1 didn't succeed (the first 3 all failed). So good luck to Boom. Even if they don't succeed, I'm glad they are going to try. reply Dalewyn 11 hours agorootparentprev>Boom promises... ultra-wealthy people a few hours shorter flights? This along with another comment (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39794935) begs the question: Does everything here have to be a \"We Are The 99%\" meme? Practically every bleeding edge advancement is only available to the \"wealthy\", it's the \"wealthy\" who pay the First Adopters Tax so eventually the technology might trickle down to the commons. I say \"wealthy\" in quotes since those concerned aren't even that particularly richer than most people. Just people with slightly more surplus money in their wallet to throw around. I get the audience here is primarily FOSS and considers the very notion of money a fucking heresy, but the real world doesn't operate like that. reply Alupis 10 hours agorootparentOf course not - but this exact idea was tried and failed. What is Boom going to offer that makes it survive? So far, it seems nothing. There's estimates that if Concord still flew today, Trans-Atlantic ticket prices would start around $10,000. How many people actually want to fly in a cramped cabin for that fee? You can get very luxurious first class cabin space for much less. Ultimately, Boom will fail just like Concord. After the novelty wears off, there's very few actual customers - and even fewer repeat customers. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentI think it’s kind of bizarre that all the armchair airplane developers here know how this will end already. You could, presumably have faith that both the founders and investors have asked themselves the same questions and have come up with an answer that satisfies at least them. reply pas 8 hours agorootparentknow? no, but the data paints a very grotesque landscape of near certain failure. https://www.construction-physics.com/p/a-cycle-of-misery-the... Boom was founded by 3 people, 2 software guys and Joe Wilding (who had actual aerospace development experience). Now it's run by the only remaining software guy. sure there's an impressive staff, 700M invested in the company, but it's nowhere near the required many billions. and even after that there's zero guarantee that they can make money. reply fragmede 10 hours agorootparentprevslightly is doing a lot of work there. I'll admit I'm doing okay myself, and can afford $300 for a commercial plane ticket every once in a while, but there's a gulf between that, and being able to afford a $4,000 plane ticket, and another jump to $10,000 for a plane ticket, to being ever able to afford a to blow $250k on a trip to see the Titanic, however I'll fated that might be. There's the top 1%, but there's also a .1% and .01% that is, actually, wealthy. But you're right that there's a weird \"can't touch money\" vibe in some circles that's weird. reply ericd 9 hours agorootparentYou don't need to go to the .1% or .01% to pay for those more expensive flights, top 1% cutoff (of the US) is >$600k/yr. reply Turing_Machine 5 hours agorootparentprev> SpaceX got lots of funding because of military/government potential. Boom has raised a lot of money, including an undisclosed (but presumably large) slug of cash from the Saudis last November. > There's less than zero percent chance Boom will be able to offer cheap \"everyday joe\" prices on their aircraft.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system reply potatolicious 14 hours agorootparentILS generally still requires manual visual approaches from the minimum altitude to the ground. Only ILS Cat III-C is a true autoland that can take the aircraft down all the way to the ground. Even then, aircraft certification requirements even for Cat III-C capable aircraft requires that pilots be able to conduct a visual approach because the ILS system can fail. An aircraft that has literally no recourse when ILS Cat III-C capability goes down (either on the aircraft side or the airfield side) does not seem like a good idea, especially because in this case large categories of emergencies are positively correlated with avionics failure. For example an engine failure may cause power loss to avionics, so your fancy AR webcam feed is more likely to go down in that situation just when you need to make an emergency landing. Not impossible to overcome of course - you certainly can ensure your avionics have its own isolated (and multiply redundant) power source so that it does stay up in the event of many kinds of emergencies, but personally I'd need to really see the homework on that before I'd feel safe flying in that kind of setup. reply wkipling 11 hours agorootparentThe category of of ILS does not dictate its autoland status.

I want to sit in a plane for less time, always. reply sandworm101 15 hours agorootparent>> how do you not see supersonic flight as just generally good for everyone flying Because it require vastly more energy (fuel) per mile than most any other form of travel. Because the aircraft carry fewer people per takeoff/landing cycle, congesting airports. Those who care about time can already travel at much greater speeds. Door-to-door travel times for first class, and especially private, are already about 1/3 to 1/2 that of the common economy passenger on a domestic flight. If we wanted to speed up the process, the easy fruit is the speed of the airport rather than the aircraft. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> Those who care about time can already travel at much greater speeds There is massive room for improvement.

More practically, consider an economy networked with this travel and transport competing against one sticking to trains, trucks and Zoom. reply notahacker 14 hours agorootparentConcorde wasn't transformational for business at a time when executives couldn't work and videoconference from anywhere in the world and stay connected to the workplace for the majority of their flight duration. The realistic potential of an operationally-expensive medium range aircraft designed for scheduled passenger flights isn't going to radically change trucks, trains and Zoom. Or business jets, for people that care enough about time to pay for it in thousand dollar multiples. Even for the small fraction who can actually afford it, a supersonic airliner is still going to have range constraints eliminating the possibility of quickly crossing the world, and for the transatlantic hops it might manage, it's the 8am JFK-LHR flight competing with a business jet at a time and origin/destination airports of the executives' choosing... (for related reasons, I'd actually be more bullish about the economic case for supersonic bizjets, but there have been quite a lot of projects studying that market that haven't got anywhere...) reply sandworm101 14 hours agorootparentThe supersonic biz jet fails because they all need longer runways. The biz jet wants to land at smaller private airports to avoid the hassle (security) of large airports.

Crossing the world doesn't take days OR hours; you can have a meeting with someone halfway around the world right now.

How often does an executive actually need to go from New York to London? Or LA to Shanghai? We already ask \"could this meeting have been an email?\" Well, companies looking to save money should also be asking \"could this intercontinental business trip have been a Zoom call?\" Otherwise, it's just businesses subsidizing their executives' luxury travel expenses. reply benced 12 hours agorootparentThe existence of business class flights proves this wrong.

We also routinely had fire-retardant bombers flying eye level close enough you could read the tail numbers off with a naked eye (we were on the side of a mountain, bombers flew down the valley). Point is: the Blackbird, flying at altitude, sounded like a tree fell on the house . Big crash/thud suddenly.

They can sometimes cruise at slightly higher speeds to make up a bit of time when running behind schedule, but this comes at the cost of higher fuel burn and can only save a few minutes at most. reply mikepurvis 15 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately, I think the route to more efficiency is funneling people to massive hub airports where widebody planes carry them on less frequent runs to other hubs— but that results in longer boarding times, less flexible schedules, and more stopovers, none of which the market wants. So instead we have a bunch of smaller \"commuter\" jets making point-to-point trips, many of which are short enough that they really should be trains, not air travel. And that's a whole other issue. Sigh. reply sandworm101 15 hours agorootparentA supersonic passenger jet would not find much of market on short haul flights.

Yes, super sonic flight and things like Boom are a massive technical achievement, there is no doubt about that. But, we should not conflate technical capabilities with economic viability.

    "originBody": "FORBESINNOVATIONCYBERSECURITY PREMIUM Feds Ordered Google To Unmask Certain YouTube Users. Critics Say It’s ‘Terrifying.’ In two court orders, the federal government told Google to turn over information on anyone who viewed multiple YouTube videos and livestreams. Privacy experts say the orders are unconstitutional. Thomas Brewster Forbes Staff Senior writer at Forbes covering cybercrime, privacy and surveillance. Follow Click to save this article. You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account. Got it Mar 22, 2024,04:55pm EDT The government orders show an \"unconstitutional\" overreach by the government, multiple privacy experts said. AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES F ederal investigators have ordered Google to provide information on all viewers of select YouTube videos, according to multiple court orders obtained by Forbes. Privacy experts from multiple civil rights groups told Forbes they think the orders are unconstitutional because they threaten to turn innocent YouTube viewers into criminal suspects. In a just-unsealed case from Kentucky reviewed by Forbes, undercover cops sought to identify the individual behind the online moniker “elonmuskwhm,” who they suspect of selling bitcoin for cash, potentially running afoul of money laundering laws and rules around unlicensed money transmitting. In conversations with the user in early January, undercover agents sent links of YouTube tutorials for mapping via drones and augmented reality software, then asked Google for information on who had viewed the videos, which collectively have been watched over 30,000 times. The court orders show the government telling Google to provide the names, addresses, telephone numbers and user activity for all Google account users who accessed the YouTube videos between January 1 and January 8, 2023. The government also wanted the IP addresses of non-Google account owners who viewed the videos. The cops argued, “There is reason to believe that these records would be relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation, including by providing identification information about the perpetrators.” “No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up.” Albert Fox-Cahn, executive director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project The court granted the order and Google was told to keep the request secret until it was unsealed earlier this week, when it was obtained by Forbes. The court records do not show whether or not Google provided data in the case. In another example, involving an investigation in New Hampshire, the Portsmouth Police received a threat from an unknown male that an explosive had been placed in a trashcan in a public area. The order says that after the police searched the area, they learned they were being watched over a YouTube live stream camera associated with a local business. Federal investigators believe similar events have happened across the U.S., where bomb threats were made and cops watched via YouTube. They asked Google to provide a list of accounts that “viewed and/or interacted with” eight YouTube live streams and the associated identifying information during specific timeframes. That included a video posted by Boston and Maine Live, which has 130,000 subscribers. Mike McCormack, who set up the company behind the account, IP Time Lapse, said he knew about the order, adding that they related \"to swatting incidents directed at the camera views at that time.\" Again, it’s unclear whether Google provided the data. \"With all law enforcement demands, we have a rigorous process designed to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement,” said Google spokesperson Matt Bryant. “We examine each demand for legal validity, consistent with developing case law, and we routinely push back against overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands for user data, including objecting to some demands entirely.\" The Justice Department had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. Privacy experts said the orders were unconstitutional because they threatened to undo protections in the 1st and 4th Amendments covering free speech and freedom from unreasonable searches. “This is the latest chapter in a disturbing trend where we see government agencies increasingly transforming search warrants into digital dragnets. It’s unconstitutional, it’s terrifying and it’s happening every day,” said Albert Fox-Cahn, executive director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up. I’m horrified that the courts are allowing this.” He said the orders were “just as chilling” as geofence warrants, where Google has been ordered to provide data on all users in the vicinity of a crime. Google announced an update in December that will make it technically impossible for the tech giant to provide information in response to geofence orders. Prior to that, a California court had ruled that a geofence warrant covering several densely-populated areas in Los Angeles was unconstitutional, leading to hopes the courts would stop police seeking the data. “What we watch online can reveal deeply sensitive information about us—our politics, our passions, our religious beliefs, and much more,” said John Davisson, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “It's fair to expect that law enforcement won't have access to that information without probable cause. This order turns that assumption on its head.” MORE FROM FORBES MORE FROM FORBES Google Just Killed Warrants That Give Police Access To Location Data By Cyrus Farivar MORE FROM FORBES This $4 Billion Car Surveillance Startup Says It Cuts Crime.

He was, essentially, talking about the principle of innocent until proven guilty; that innocent people shouldn't suffer by being punished for a crime unjustly. 2999 innocent people, in your formulation, though, are not being punished for a crime. They're not even being accused of a crime. reply AnthonyMouse 4 hours agorootparent> innocent people, in your formulation, though, are not being punished for a crime. They're not even being accused of a crime. They are, however, being harmed. It's easier to use historical examples because they're not afflicted with modern politics. The FBI was known to investigate and harass civil rights leaders during the civil rights movement. Suppose they want to do that today. Step one, come up with some pretext for why they should get a list of all the people who watched some video. It only has to be strong enough to get the list, not result in a conviction, because the point is only to get the list. Meanwhile the system is designed to punish them for a thin pretext by excluding the evidence when they go to charge someone and their lawyer provides context and an adversarial voice, but since their goal here isn't to gather evidence for a particular investigation, that's no deterrent. Step two, now that they have the list of people interested in this type of content they can go on a fishing expedition looking for ways to harass them or charge them with unrelated crimes. This harms them, they're innocent people, therefore this should be prevented. Ideally by never recording this type of information to begin with. There is a reason good librarians are wary about keeping a history of who borrowed a particular book. reply dllthomas 4 hours agorootparentSurely you are not contending that Blackstone was of the position that no innocent person should be investigated, however briefly, unless it results in at least 10 convictions. I very much agree that (some, probably minimal) harm is being done to these people. Pretending that they \"suffer\" in the sense Blackstone was using the word is disingenuous. reply AnthonyMouse 3 hours agorootparentBeing investigated is a red herring. The problem is from the other end. Your premise is that a person being investigated when they're innocent of the original crime is basically harmless because the investigation will come to naught. The actual issue is that if they can find a pretext to get a list of all of the people who viewed some content they don't approve of, now they have a list of targets with which to play \"bring me the man and I'll find you the crime\" and that is a harm in need of preventing. reply dllthomas 3 hours agorootparent> Your premise is that a person being investigated when they're innocent of the original crime is basically harmless because the investigation will come to naught. Not at all. I would say that it's usually (not always!) small in the particulars but adds up in aggregate, and that we should be a lot more careful with how much surveillance we allow. I just would also say that the kinds or amounts of harm being done there are manifestly not what Blackstone was talking about in his \"formulation\" as it leads immediately to absurd conclusions that go very well past the present case. I will not here that \"there is a concern here analogous to Blackstone's ratio\" is a different thing than, paraphrasing what was up thread, \"this is substantially more extreme than Blackstone's ratio should forbid\". And in case I haven't said it in thread anywhere, I share concerns about surveillance. I just think if we are enlisting support from historical figures, we should find a quote where they're talking about the question or acknowledge the distance, rather than pretending the quote means something it didn't - that will only turn off those who might be persuaded. reply AnthonyMouse 2 hours agorootparent> \"there is a concern here analogous to Blackstone's ratio\" is a different thing than, paraphrasing what was up thread, \"this is substantially more extreme than Blackstone's ratio should forbid\". I agree with this. What's happening here is different than the scenario in the original ratio, even though it's a similar concern. > I just would also say that the kinds or amounts of harm being done there are manifestly not what Blackstone was talking about in his \"formulation\" as it leads immediately to absurd conclusions that go very well past the present case. If we direct ourselves to the case at hand, I'm not sure that a general rule that the government can't compel innocent bystanders to assist an investigation against their will would even be a net negative, much less cause serious problems. When a crime is committed people will generally be inclined to help bring the perpetrators to justice, because who wants thieves and murderers and so on going unpunished? Whereas if someone is disinclined to help, we might consider that they could have a reason, e.g. because the law being enforced is unjust or they believe the investigation is not being conducted in good faith, or they simply don't trust the government with the information, at which point the ability to refuse acts as a reasonable check on government power. > I just think if we are enlisting support from historical figures, we should find a quote where they're talking about the question or acknowledge the distance, rather than pretending the quote means something it didn't - that will only turn off those who might be persuaded. I feel like historical quotes tend to detract from discussions in general, because they're effectively an appeal to authority and then the discussion turns to exactly where we are now, debating whether the current situation can be distinguished from the original, which is a separate matter from whether what's happening in the modern case is reasonable or satisfactory in its own right. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparent> What's happening here is different than the scenario in the original ratio, even though it's a similar concern. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure Blackstone wrote about negative or natural rights. In fact, let me pull out more context around the exact quote. He specifically addresses direct punishment but immediately after is the nature of having the duty to defend one's innocence. Which is exactly the case here. Fourthly, all presumptive evidence of felony should be admitted cautiously, for the law holds that ***it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.*** And Sir Matthew Hale in particular lays down two rules most prudent and necessary to be observed: 1. Never to convict a man for stealing the goods of a person unknown, merely because he will give no account how he came by them, unless an actual felony be proved of such goods; and, 2. Never to convict any person of murder or manslaughter till at least the body be found dead; on account of two instances he mentions where persons were executed for the murder of others who were then alive but missing. Lastly, it was an antient and commonly-received practice that as counsel was not allowed to any prisoner accused of a capital crime, so neither should he be suffered to exculpate himself by the testimony of any witnesses. I would not be surprised if Blackstone found the act of investigation without the qualification of sufficient suspicion as gross injustice and directly relevant to his intent. As this is a less inconvenient version of locking everyone in a room and interviewing them checking their pockets for stolen goods before they leave. The negative or god given right of innocence is innate. The punishment is the accusation and search, which is an explicit infringement on the natural right. Yes, rights can be infringed upon, but not without due cause and not simply because one is in a position of authority. I know that this is a point of contention in this (these) discussions, but I stand by that a right is being violated and harm is being done by the simple act of investigation. Mass surveillance (which is mass investigation), is an infringement on our god given rights. The point is to have friction for the infringement of rights. All rights can be violated, but they must need sufficient reason. It does not matter if these rights seem inconsequential or not. Because at the end of the day, that is a matter of opinion and perspective. Blackstone was writing about authoritarian governments and the birth of America was similarly founded on the idea of treating government as an adversary. These were all part of the same conversation, and they were happening at the same time. I do not think I am taking the historical quote out of context. I think it is more in context than most realize. But I'm neither a historian nor a lawyer, so maybe there is additional context I am missing. But as far as I can tell, this is all related and we should not be distinguishing investigation (or from the other side of the same coin, exculpation) from punishment as these are in the same concept of reducing one's rights. They are just a matter of degree. https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/sharswood-commentaries-on... reply AnthonyMouse 1 hour agorootparent> He specifically addresses direct punishment but immediately after is the nature of having the duty to defend one's innocence. The issue is that the ratio can't mean much outside the realm of a criminal conviction when any of the rest of it would need a different standard. Suppose we want to evaluate if it's reasonable for the police to search your residence for a murder weapon. Should we let 100 guilty people go free to avoid one search of an innocent person? That's probably not right, a search is enough of an imposition to require probable cause, but if you had to prove the crime to the same level as would be necessary for a conviction in order to get a warrant then searches would always be superfluous because they could only happen in cases where guilt is already fully established without the results of the search. Conversely, with this YouTube kind of situation where the police want data on large numbers of people, the majority of whom are fully expected to be innocent, they're not even reaching probable cause for those people. Which is a lesser standard for justifiable reasons but it's still not one which is being met for those people. And so it's still a problem, but it's a different problem with a different standard. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparentI find this interpretation odd. I do not see the numbers as meaningful in a literal sense but rather in a means of making a point and a grounding for the surrounding abstraction. I think the point is to explicitly discuss these bounds and view them as a spectrum. To think of them in the abstract but to push back against authority. Certainly Blackstone was not saying that infringement of rights (punishment) should not happen under any circumstance. Rather that there should be significant friction and that we should take great care to ensure that this is not eroded. reply bowsamic 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is true of literally any investigation though reply AnthonyMouse 2 hours agorootparentIt isn't. If the police are investigating John Smith and they get a warrant for the files of John Smith then they don't also get the files of anybody else along with them. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparentAnd importantly, there has to be sufficient reason for investigating John Smith. It can't be arbitrary (he looks funny, has a limp, is black, is gay, plays Doom, is a Muslim, etc). Rights can be infringed, but they need reason. And they need good reason. reply godelski 4 hours agorootparentprevI would contend that Blackstone was of the position that no innocent person who was not of sufficient suspicion of committing a crime should be investigated. These are innocent bystanders. There is nothing suspicious about their activities other than they did something that a suspected criminal did. A perfectly legal activity? To take this to the ridiculous side, are we going to investigate everyone who took a poop at a specific time because a criminal did? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJklHwoYgBQ reply dllthomas 3 hours agorootparent> Blackstone was of the position that no innocent person who was not of sufficient suspicion of committing a crime should be investigated I expect so. But pretending that's what he was talking about in the quote you were referencing is going to undermine your (our, probably) position with those not already convinced. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparentI'm not convinced I am taking him out of context[0]. Was Blackstone not also discussing natural rights? I see him as viewing punishments as infringements on ones rights. As a spectrum. And those rights even including the simple aspect of presumption of innocence. My best understanding is that so much is literally about the mundane and simple. Because natural rights are... well... natural. They are things we have until we don't. That's why they are called negative rights, because they need be removed, not given. Punishments (infringements) can be extremely minor to major. But they are still one in the same because it is about the concept in the abstract. Or rather, in generalized form. As far as I can tell, this is explicitly within the context of the quote. That said, I do see your point and appreciate your feedback. Maybe this can be an opportunity to turn this into a lesson? It seems too cumbersome to bring up from the get-go and similarly backfire. But discussing in the abstract is a difficult task when it is neither a natural way of thinking nor is it a common way that is taught. But I still think it is an important tool and something that does distinguish humanity. I am open to suggestions (I think HN of all places is more likely to be successful when discussing things in the abstract, but it is still general public).

But that's not the same > potentially investigate if there's something off? If you're asking information from people who witnessed a crime *and volunteering information* (which is not investigating that person and not accusing them of a crime, nor is lack of volunteering information a suspicious activity) and they then generate suspicious evidence, then yes, that enables capacity for investigation. It is true that things are not static, time exists, and entropy marches on. That's the difference. There is nothing that these people did that warrants suspicion. These people are not being asked or questioned. This was not done voluntarily. They didn't even know this was happening to them. This was a thing imposed upon them, full stop. I want to give a scenario to help make things clear. Suppose I send nudes to my partner. The government intercepts these without my knowledge, looks at these, and deletes them, and literally nothing else happens. Is this okay? I did not know this happened to me. No \"harm\" has fallen upon me. And as far as I know, nothing has changed in my life. But then later I find out this happened. Let's say 20 years later. I feel upset. Do you not think I am justified in being upset? I think I do. My rights were violated. It is worse that it was done in secrecy because it is difficult for me to seek justice. It is because I have the right to privacy. It is a natural, de facto, negative, but a god given right. They put my information at risk by simply intercepting it and making a copy.

Some hyperbole in your telling of the story and failure to mention that he was awarded restitution. According to Wikipedia: Brandon Mayfield (born July 15, 1966) is a Muslim-American convert in Washington County, Oregon, who was wrongfully detained in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings on the basis of a faulty fingerprint match. On May 6, 2004, the FBI arrested Mayfield as a material witness in connection with the Madrid attacks, and held him for two weeks, before releasing him with a public apology following Spanish authorities identifying another suspect.[1] A United States DOJ internal review later acknowledged serious errors in the FBI investigation.

The burden of proof is step by step. I don't think I should have to cite the 4th Amendment but The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and ***no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.*** The setup was to treat the government as an adversary. Needing to understand positive rights vs negative rights[0]. Obviously rights are not infinite, but there should be friction. Doesn't matter if the thing is seemingly innocent or inconsequential, what matters is power. Perception shifts and creeps so this is why people take a stand at what might seem trivial.

Franklin says if you know 101 people watched a video, and 100 of them are guilty of a crime, you can't just round up all 101 and throw them in jail. I.e., if you have a standard of punishment that would convict even one innocent person for every 100 guilty people it catches, it's not a good standard. Which I think we can all agree with. But that's not what's happening here, is it? reply godelski 4 hours agorootparent> you can't just round up all 101 and throw them in jail Yes. \"100 people\" (or whatever) had their rights violated.

Otherwise, the only reasonable search would be when a government official is already certain of your guilt. reply godelski 4 hours agorootparentI'd consider your rights being violated \"punishment.\" Blackstone was talking in the abstract. Clearly Franklin was too considering many of the other things he's known for saying. reply andsoitis 3 hours agorootparent> I'd consider your rights being violated \"punishment.\" You are wrong. Punishment is when you impose a penalty as retribution for an offense. reply godelski 2 hours agorootparentYou can call me wrong, but maybe first ensure you understand negative rights. I understand why you think I'm wrong, but I hope you understand why I think that way. We can disagree, and that is fine, but let's not act as if there are objective answers in social constructs. Because, I do think punishment is an imposed penalty. In this case, on your rights. Rights are abstract, and these are not binary nor clearly discrete. House arrest is not jail, nor are fines. But as communicated to you elsewhere, the 4th amendment is about ensuring friction for removing someone's negative rights. But I disagree that punishment is imposed as a penalty as retribution for an offense. You imply that this requires an actual offense to have been made. I assure you that punishment can be imposed for any arbitrary reason. I can also assure you that punishment is a spectrum, from extremely minor (as I think we'd agree is in this case) and extremely harsh. reply okr 3 hours agorootparentprevIf it is an order by a court, then i think it is ok.

The police didn't upload they videos. It's not entrapment, and it doesn't sound like the actual content of the videos is illegal. Instead, they had an open communication channel with their target and were able to send them various links to youtube videos. Their theory being if they can find any user who clicked on all (or most of) those links, it's probably their target. And it's unlikely some random user would have accidentally viewed all those videos. The actual request for the raw list of all viewers seems unconstitutional to me. Too broad, gives the police a lot of infomation about all users who watched just one of the videos. But I suspect a much narrower request where google identified the target user and past just that user's info on would be constitutional. reply ChuckMcM 5 hours agoparentprevI certainly concur with this. On the one hand, a narrow warrant that reveals a lot of people (classic example are warrants on motels to provide the names of everyone who checked in on a certain date, or was registered on a certain date) are certainly constitutional and have been upheld many times.

Failing that, using it will make you a target of the government's security apparatus. If you create a cryptocurrency that can't be traced[0] or an anonymous marketplace where people can buy and sell anything they want[1], you're going to end up on the wrong end of US government trade sanctions or US drug laws. Running a Tor exit node gets your IP address blocked by much of the internet and can even get you a visit from the FBI[2]. Tor itself only exists because it was created by the US Navy as a tool for dissidents in dictatorships to be able to access the internet. The only way to solve the problem would be to elect politicians who would either dismantle most of the surveillance system or address crime and terrorism so decisively that there was no longer any plausible threat to justify continuing to maintain a mass surveillance apparatus in which case it would (hopefully) eventually wither away as part of budget cuts once politicians forget why it was even \"necessary\" in the first place. There is no solution to political problems without obtaining and using political power to solve them. The strategy of eliminating the system's justification isn't foolproof though because the bureaucracy that runs the military draft (Selective Service) somehow still exists even though the draft was ended around half a century ago and is almost certainly never coming back. Politicians only noticed it existed a few years ago long enough to debate whether to extend the wrong of registration for it to include women in addition to men. The eventual decision was to leave the status quo intact[3]. The sensible option of abolishing that relic of a past rights violation rather than continuing to waste money on maintaining the bureaucracy was not seriously considered. That means the direct route is almost certainly the better approach. [0]: https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/10/github_tornado_cookie...

If you make a HN account that you only access via Tor through a browser with Javascript turned off and stick your writing through some AI editing service, it's probably pretty difficult to trace anything back to you. If you stream yourself 16 hours a day every day, your nickname probably isn't saving you from much, as it only takes one person to go \"oh I know them\" and then your secret's out. So like everything, it's about a striking a balance. Who is out to get you, and how much do you like doing things online? Just a question you can ask yourself before you move into a cabin in the woods and work on your novel 24/7 or whatever.

And Ross Ulbricht, maybe he wouldn't have been caught so easily if he changed hosters occasionally and the VPN had listed 100 internet cafes in different cities as connecting IP addresses instead of just 1.

It was in the Snowden leak.

Within weeks of the MUSCULAR leaks, all Google datacenters were communicating with each other with proper SSL termination. Are you familiar with Aurora? It was that time in 2009 when a Chinese military unit broke into Google and started poking around for information about some known dissidents. They were expunged quickly and the level at which Google stepped up their security game is unparalleled in the history of infosec. Yes, the NSA or various law enforcement groups can get information from Google if it goes through the proper channels, and there's probably a handful of intelligence community insiders who hand data out of Google from time to time as well, even as part of various intelligence sharing agreements, but the idea that the NSA just has free access to whatever they want there is ridiculous. reply Bu9818 2 hours agoprevUse Invidious, use RSS, use yt-dlp, use Tor. reply Razengan 1 hour agoprevAll this surveillance and cops still can't catch day to day petty thieves and scammers. reply self_awareness 3 hours agoprev1.

Say that there is a stalker who hacked someone's devices and pulled private information and videos from them, and posted them publicly. Something unequivocally bad. We would all agree that there needs to be a way to investigate and stop this person and seek justice for the victims. Until recently, taking this to the cops would get you a blank stare and nothing would happen. At least now in certain places it is taken seriously. But traditional investigative methods don't work. They would need to get access logs to the places where that data was uploaded, at the very least. Cops are not particularly great at investigating (most crime is solved by confessions or just catching them in the act). They don't have any reason not to just blindly grab all the data and sort through it by hand, because that's what they know how to do, and if they request it and get denied, why would they care? They either try something else or say 'fuck it'. Local Judges see a request for records and a block of time and it seems reasonable to get that info. No one is sitting and explaining to them the implications of allowing cops access to personal information from viewer logs. Historically, the lower courts are not the place to seek enlightened rulings. Google? I honestly have no love for them, and they bend over for China every day for worse stuff, so I would be surprised if they gave two shits about their users, except that if this becomes common enough they might actually have to devote support to these requests, and they hate giving support, so they might fight it just for their own self-interest.

    "title": "Mozilla Ends Onerep Partnership Over CEO's People-Search Networks",
    "originLink": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/mozilla-drops-onerep-after-ceo-admits-to-running-people-search-networks/",
    "originBody": "March 22, 2024 6 Comments The nonprofit organization that supports the Firefox web browser said today it is winding down its new partnership with Onerep, an identity protection service recently bundled with Firefox that offers to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites. The move comes just days after a report by KrebsOnSecurity forced Onerep’s CEO to admit that he has founded dozens of people-search networks over the years. Mozilla Monitor. Image Mozilla Monitor Plus video on Youtube. Mozilla only began bundling Onerep in Firefox last month, when it announced the reputation service would be offered on a subscription basis as part of Mozilla Monitor Plus. Launched in 2018 under the name Firefox Monitor, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website Have I Been Pwned? to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches. On March 14, KrebsOnSecurity published a story showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder Dimitiri Shelest launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called Nuwber that sells background reports on people. Onerep and Shelest did not respond to requests for comment on that story. But on March 21, Shelest released a lengthy statement wherein he admitted to maintaining an ownership stake in Nuwber, a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he launched Onerep. Shelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him. “I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.” The full statement is available here (PDF). Onerep CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest. In a statement released today, a spokesperson for Mozilla said it was moving away from Onerep as a service provider in its Monitor Plus product. “Though customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep’s CEO do not align with our values,” Mozilla wrote. “We’re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first.” KrebsOnSecurity also reported that Shelest’s email address was used circa 2010 by an affiliate of Spamit, a Russian-language organization that paid people to aggressively promote websites hawking male enhancement drugs and generic pharmaceuticals. As noted in the March 14 story, this connection was confirmed by research from multiple graduate students at my alma mater George Mason University. Shelest denied ever being associated with Spamit. “Between 2010 and 2014, we put up some web pages and optimize them — a widely used SEO practice — and then ran AdSense banners on them,” Shelest said, presumably referring to the dozens of people-search domains KrebsOnSecurity found were connected to his email addresses (dmitrcox@gmail.com and dmitrcox2@gmail.com). “As we progressed and learned more, we saw that a lot of the inquiries coming in were for people.” Shelest also acknowledged that Onerep pays to run ads on “on a handful of data broker sites in very specific circumstances.” “Our ad is served once someone has manually completed an opt-out form on their own,” Shelest wrote. “The goal is to let them know that if they were exposed on that site, there may be others, and bring awareness to there being a more automated opt-out option, such as Onerep.” Reached via Twitter/X, HaveIBeenPwned founder Troy Hunt said he knew Mozilla was considering a partnership with Onerep, but that he was previously unaware of the Onerep CEO’s many conflicts of interest. “I knew Mozilla had this in the works and we’d casually discussed it when talking about Firefox monitor,” Hunt told KrebsOnSecurity. “The point I made to them was the same as I’ve made to various companies wanting to put data broker removal ads on HIBP: removing your data from legally operating services has minimal impact, and you can’t remove it from the outright illegal ones who are doing the genuine damage.” Playing both sides — creating and spreading the same digital disease that your medicine is designed to treat — may be highly unethical and wrong. But in the United States it’s not against the law. Nor is collecting and selling data on Americans. Privacy experts say the problem is that data brokers, people-search services like Nuwber and Onerep, and online reputation management firms exist because virtually all U.S. states exempt so-called “public” or “government” records from consumer privacy laws. Those include voting registries, property filings, marriage certificates, motor vehicle records, criminal records, court documents, death records, professional licenses, and bankruptcy filings. Data brokers also can enrich consumer records with additional information, by adding social media data and known associates. The March 14 story on Onerep was the second in a series of three investigative reports published here this month that examined the data broker and people-search industries, and highlighted the need for more congressional oversight — if not regulation — on consumer data protection and privacy. On March 8, KrebsOnSecurity published A Close Up Look at the Consumer Data Broker Radaris, which showed that the co-founders of Radaris operate multiple Russian-language dating services and affiliate programs. It also appears many of their businesses have ties to a California marketing firm that works with a Russian state-run media conglomerate currently sanctioned by the U.S. government. On March 20, KrebsOnSecurity published The Not-So-True People-Search Network from China, which revealed an elaborate web of phony people-search companies and executives designed to conceal the location of people-search affiliates in China who are earning money promoting U.S. based data brokers that sell personal information on Americans.

    "commentBody": "Mozilla Drops Onerep After CEO Admits to Running People-Search Networks (krebsonsecurity.com)284 points by todsacerdoti 14 hours agohidepastfavorite103 comments hayst4ck 7 hours agoIf company A creates a problem that company B is paid to solve, then company B benefits when company A is able to make the problem bigger. Therefore Company A and company B both have a vested interest in the problem continuing to be problematic. Both are in a symbiotic relationship that allows them to both extract a profit while providing no net benefit to society. This is rent-seeking (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking). Rent-seeking is an economic drag and ethically indefensible. Regulation is how this problem gets solved and it's the only way it gets solved. reply BLKNSLVR 6 hours agoparentThere was an article on HN recently about government agencies (but also applied to private companies) that are setup to solve problem X and often evolve to, not necessarily causing it, but making it harder to solve. reply Brananarchy 6 hours agorootparentIf it's the one I'm thinking of: the title was about government, but all of the examples in the article were private firms with profit motives. The author implied that government must work the same way as industry, but that's a huge assumption.

Not someone who's mainly looking at it from a business development or career angle. Now the aftermath could use a fighter, looking for how they could legally disassemble the entire racket. Not only because it's arguably on-mission, but more importantly because Mozilla has a reputation to redeem on this now. (For example, no matter how that party has squeaked by wrt consumers, maybe there's a new angle in their dealings with Mozilla, such as a different kind of fraud. And Mozilla is much more able to pursue the matter than most individuals would be.) reply myself248 12 hours agoparentThis.

God knows they should pursue building a browser. It’s a simple concept, it doesn’t need ChatGPT-set-to-dramatic words. reply ds 12 hours agoprevAll the existing databroker remover tools are flawed because they make use of manual labor to remove you from sites, primarily done by people in third world countries. We @ https://redact.dev are working on a pure software mechanism for doing these optouts directly from your own device. We already have full mass deletions for over 40 social media and utilitys. reply vohk 12 hours agoparentI really dislike the trend of making everything a subscription service. I can imagine a niche market that wants to continuously delete content older than an arbitrary window but isn't this the sort of service that most users would need only need sporadically? The pricing seems to implicitly acknowledge this: $35/m billed monthly vs $8/m billed annually! Would you really expect anyone to intentionally renew monthly? I can't argue that people forgetting to unsubscribe pays the bills, but as a business model it leaves a bad taste. reply micromacrofoot 12 hours agorootparentData brokers are like the hydra, one goes down and another 2 new ones pop up. It's a lot of work to keep on top of deletions if you want privacy. reply quatrefoil 9 hours agorootparentNot really. There's a fairly small and stable number of companies that actually collect and resell information about you. There is also about a zillion ephemeral web front ends that republish this data, however. I suspect this is done for a reason, but a bit of sleuthing quickly reveals who the big players are. These \"data removal\" services spend a lot of effort going after the frontends, which is pretty self-serving: they can show the customer that there's something new to remove every single month or quarter, so you have to keep paying forever. reply jart 9 hours agorootparentWhat else could they do? They're working within a system that the government designed, and the government always designs things to keep people running on the hamster wheel. reply quatrefoil 8 hours agorootparentRequest deletion from backend brokers? Many have some mechanisms for opt-out, either in general or for people in specific states (e.g., California). reply jart 8 hours agorootparentOK so if Optery reports 330 removals, how many removals did they actually have to do on their end? A hundred? Thirty? Ten? Why should we care? If you pay a man to remove the snow from your driveway, would you be upset if he used a plow rather than a shovel? reply makeitdouble 7 hours agorootparentWouldn't you be upset if you paid him hourly so he used a spoon and went slowly enough that snow accumulates faster than he'll ever clear your driveway ? Parent's argument is that current approach leads to an endless cat and mouse game the user ends up paying, when there would be ways to end it faster and cheaper. reply jart 7 hours agorootparentYes but how is that the fault of removal services? They can't do anything to stop the usual suspects from filing for a fresh corporation from Delaware each week. reply makeitdouble 6 hours agorootparentThat makes it a weirder proposition to me. Does that mean the user keeps paying just to have someone somewhere do \"something\" ? And that, even if fundamentally it can't solve the sutiation, can't prove it's even improving in any specific ways (telling you it removes hundreds of instances doesn't tell you how many have been added in the meantime), and they also have no incentives to be too zealous as the numbers in the reports would be going down and the motivation to subscribe also diminish. Ps: perhaps the way out of this is to make it a non profit that provides jobs to people in need, and have the subscription a recurring donation ? reply bigyikes 11 hours agorootparentprevI don’t necessarily doubt you, but do you have any source for this, or in general any information on the landscape of data brokers? It’s hard to imagine what the situation actually looks like behind the scenes. reply mgiampapa 12 hours agoparentprevThis explains some trends where posts are being edited on Reddit with nonsense then deleted. Personally, I think this kind of behavior makes the web poorer as a knowledge base. Yes you have a right to do it with your own content, but doing it at scale makes the internet a less useful tool and it makes me a bit sad since the scrapers will already have the data anyway. reply dotnet00 8 hours agorootparentThose are mostly in response to reddit's API changes. By editing the comments before deletion, the archives also get wiped and it takes a bit more effort for reddit to restore deleted comments behind users' backs. Yes, it makes the web poorer as a knowledge base, but it's in response to companies like reddit ruining the internet by baiting in users, changing the agreement and then trying to keep the content that was written under the previous agreements. reply Brian_K_White 10 hours agorootparentprevHopefully it just makes sites remove the ability to edit or delete things once they've been published. Especially forums where things have been referenced by other things. As much as I routinely fine-tune and fix up a comment after initially writing, I will happily go back to the old days before such ability became common, in trade for the sanity of references that don't disappear or change meaning after the fact. The typos don't hurt as much as the swiss cheese and schitzo conversations. reply CaptainFever 6 hours agorootparentA good compromise in the meantime would be the Internet Archive. A lot of useful data is preserved there. This made me curious about archivist ethics: https://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-state... > Privacy: Archivists recognize that privacy is an inherent fundamental right and sanctioned by law. They establish procedures and policies to protect the interests of the donors, individuals, groups, and organizations whose public and private lives and activities are documented in archival holdings. As appropriate and mandated by law, archivists place access restrictions on collections to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are maintained, particularly for individuals and groups who have had no voice or role in collections’ creation, retention, or public use. Archivists should maintain transparency when placing these restrictions, documenting why and for how long they will be enacted. Archivists promote the respectful use of culturally sensitive materials in their care by encouraging researchers to consult with those represented by records, recognizing that privacy has both legal and cultural dimensions. Archivists respect all users’ rights to privacy by maintaining the confidentiality of their research and protecting any personal information collected about the users in accordance with their institutions’ policies. reply superq 7 hours agorootparentprevPersonally I think we need the ability to delete more, not less. Yes, I do see the irony of writing that here. :'( reply arp242 6 hours agorootparentThe problem with the wholesale deletion of comments is that it also affects other people. For example if we have a back-and-forth constructive conversation here and one of us deletes all comments, then the value of the other person's comments are diminished, and sometimes even incomprehensible. It's pretty clear you're putting something in the public when you're commenting on HN; this isn't a surprise and nothing is done surreptitiously. If you contribute to a debate in some TV discussion programme then you can't have that deleted later either. And there are options without wholesale deletion: specific comments can be deleted or edited for specific reasons, and your account can be \"soft-deleted\" by changing your username to something random. If you want to have more ephemeral temporary conversations then that's fair! But HN is not the right platform for that, IMHO. reply stainablesteel 10 hours agoparentprevthat's not actually a flaw a real flaw is that companies in this niche are actually centralizing data to re-sell while adding a new line in the dataset that says \"wanted to remove their data footprints\" reply shrimp_emoji 12 hours agoparentprevIn other words, would you describe your site as the Gillette razor attachment mechanism of online data deletion? reply miguelazo 12 hours agoparentprevMany databrokers make it very difficult to remove your info, on purpose, of course. That is why the legit removal providers have to rely on manual labor for some. I'd love to see it fully automated, but I'll believe it when I see it. Last I checked, Optery was removing 325+. Best of luck-- you have a long way to go. Edit: this looks like a totally different service. Mass deletion of old posts is one thing, removing PII from data brokers is another. reply Sephr 10 hours agoprevI would only trust a tool for sending mass opt-out requests to every company that I've interacted with if it was free and open source. Even with good intentions, commerce becomes yet another tracking instrument. reply jart 9 hours agoparentNot possible. Open source code doesn't have limited power of attorney. Data brokers would also read its code and thwart whatever logic it uses to fill out forms. reply Sephr 7 hours agorootparentYou have power of attorney for yourself. Open source tools can run on your own systems and represent you. reply jart 6 hours agorootparentIf the open source software interacts with the data brokers as you, then how would it do that without giving up even more of your personal information? Services like Optery also lose the ability to remove your information from a data broker if you have a direct account with them. So you better hope that open source maintainer doesn't lose interest after a while, since if they do, you'll be permanently doomed to logging into hundreds of broker sites each year to refresh your opt-out. reply Zuiii 6 hours agorootparentprevExactly. What we really need is a public, open list of all tracker companies that anyone can contribute to (like adblock lists). What we do with that list is up to us and our governments. reply AdmiralAsshat 14 hours agoprevI think Mozilla's heart was in the right place here, but pretty disappointing that they didn't vet their partner more thoroughly than what some GMU grad students were able to uncover.

People complain about the Google search deal and I get why, but I've been using the browser since back when it was called Phoenix, and at this point I'm pretty sure the Google deal is the only reason it's still alive. The engineering is still solid; its stewardship seems anything but. reply ckozlowski 12 hours agorootparentprevCan you share more? reply IntToDouble 12 hours agorootparentIn terms of the incubator, looks like it was replaced with Mozilla Ventures: https://builders.mozilla.community/ https://builders.mozilla.community/old/alumni.html With respect to Kanary, I have my entire family the platform and it's drastically reduced the amount of garbage (figurative) that comes through our door.

What specifically did this influence, or is likely to be influenced? What specifically is made worse by this? There's always these vague accusations, but never any specifics. reply jqpabc123 6 hours agorootparentBy default, Firefox makes it real easy to uniquely identify and track you, refuses to block ads and apparently, don't care much about marketshare. Wonder why? Details are readily available if you know how to search. reply arp242 6 hours agorootparentAny browser makes it easy to track you because that's how the web works and it's hard to fully prevent without significantly affecting compatibility and/or feature set. Firefox does have some \"Enhanced Tracking Protection\" features for this though. And (extensively) changing the content of webpages by default would be inappropriate for a mainstream browser; it's not their job to curate what you see, and this includes ads (for starters, it's not so easy to even classify what an \"ad\" is). These are just more vague accusations, and just as unencumbered by any evidence as your previous vague accusations were. reply jqpabc123 14 minutes agorootparentGo here and see for yourself: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org reply citizenpaul 11 hours agoprevI've had to make the hard acceptance that privacy is absolutely irrevocably dead. Anyone with power or money can now find out not only anything about you but likely even more than you know or realize about yourself.

Unless there is massive senate/house/pres unification on absolutely crushing the endless disgusting behavior of spying on people to diminish them and enrich yourself is made illegal WITH CONSEQUENCES. Nothing will change. This will never happen because the US gov is the both the biggest customer and purveyor of these services.

We are actively conducting a search for a permanent CEO to build upon Stability AI’s foundation and lead the company into its next phase of growth. “On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank Emad for his leadership and relentless commitment to Stability AI and the open source movement,” said Jim O’Shaughnessy, Chairman of the Board at Stability AI. “As we search for a permanent CEO, I have full confidence that Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte, in their roles as interim co-CEOs, will adeptly steer the company forward in developing and commercializing industry-leading generative AI products. Their complementary skill sets and experience ideally suit them for this role, giving us confidence in our future and in our ability to emerge from this period as a stronger company.” “I am proud two years after bringing on our first developer to have led Stability to hundreds of millions of downloads and the best models across modalities. I believe strongly in Stability AI’s mission and feel the company is in capable hands. It is now time to ensure AI remains open and decentralised,” said Emad Mostaque. This leadership change marks an opportunity for Stability AI, the management team, Board of Directors, and investors in a shared commitment to realize the full vision for the company’s next stage of growth. Together, we are committed to preserving the exceptional team, cutting-edge technology, and vibrant community that’s been cultivated over the years, ensuring Stability AI remains a leader in open multi-modal generative AI.

In my opinion, a paid, easy to use, robust UI around Stability's models should have been the number one priority and they waited far too long to even begin. There's been a lot of amazing augmentations to the stable diffusion models (ControlNet, Dreambooth etc) that have propped up, lots of free research and implementations because the research community has latched onto the stability models and I feel they failed to capitalize on any of it. reply jonplackett 2 hours agorootparentLeonardo.ai have basically done exactly this and seem to be doing OK. It’s a shame because they’re literally just using stable diffusion for all their tech but built a nicer front end and incorporated control net. No-where else has done this. Controlnet / instantID etc are the really killer things about SD and make it way more powerful than Midjourney, but they aren’t even available via the stability API. They just don’t seem to care. reply biztos 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, and I'm grateful to them for sticking to that plan. :-) But for the individuals involved, it might also be Step 2: Leverage fame in AI space for massive VC injection on favorable terms. reply OscarTheGrinch 2 hours agorootparentprevHeres a Stable Diffusion buisness idea: sign up all the celebrities and artists who are cool with AI, and provide end users / fans with an AI image generation interface, trained on their exclusive likenesses / artwork (loras).

Also no need to pay actors outrageous sums to use their likeness in perpetuity as long as you do business.

Depending on the task I fear it could be too slow to be useful. I believe there is some research on how to distribute large models across multiple GPUs, which could make the cost less lumpy. reply AnthonyMouse 1 hour agorootparentYou can get a decent approximation for LLM performance in tokens/second by dividing the model size in GB by the system's memory bandwidth. That's assuming it's well-optimized and memory rather than compute bound, but those are often both true or pretty close. And \"depending on the task\" is the point. There are systems that would be uselessly slow for real-time interaction but if your concern is to have it process confidential data you don't want to upload to a third party you can just let it run and come back whenever it finishes. And releasing the model allows people to do the latter even if machines necessary to do the former are still prohibitively expensive. Also, hardware gets cheaper over time and it's useful to have the model out there so it's well-optimized and stable by the time fast hardware becomes affordable instead of waiting for the hardware and only then getting to work on the code. reply Takennickname 55 minutes agorootparentprevI will make a 2 trillion parameter model just so your comment becomes outdated and wrong. reply renewiltord 2 hours agorootparentprevMixtral 8x7b is better than both of those and runs on a top spec M3 Max wonderfully. reply GaggiX 3 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT is 20B according to Microsoft researchers, also the fact that big AI models are trillion parameter models is mostly speculation, about GPT-4 it was spread by geohot. reply speedgoose 3 hours agorootparentTo be precise, ChatGPT 3.5 turbo being 20B is officially a mistake from a Microsoft Researcher, quoting a wrong source published before the release of chatgpt3.5 turbo.

And while AIs may become more compute-efficient in some respects, the tasks we ask AIs to do will grow larger and more complex. Sure you might get a good image locally but what about when the market moves to video?

I don't know if those hits will be in profits (depends on the company) but it will clearly hit that uncanny valley. - 6-8 year mark will have studios hiring like crazy to get the talent they bled back. They won't be as big as before, but it will grow to a more sane level of operation. - 10-12 year mark will have the \"Apple\" of AI finally nail the happy medium between efficiency and profitability (hopefully without devastating the workers, but who knows?). Competitors will follow throw and properly usher the promises AI is making right now. - 15 year mark is when AI has proper pipelining, training, college courses, legal lines, etc. established and becomes standard faire, no stranger than using an IDE. As I see it, companies and AI tech alike are trying to pretend to be the 10 year mark all the while we're currently in legal talks and figuring out what and where to use AI to begin with. In my biased opinion, I hope there's enough red tape on generative art to make it not worth it for large studios to leverage it easily (e.g. generative art loses all copyright/trademarkability, even if using owned IPs. Likely not that extreme, but close). reply minimaxir 6 hours agoparentprevAI businesses/models are capturing economic value: the problem is that costs are increasing much faster than revenue. reply Satam 5 hours agorootparentWith the current limitations of AI in mind, it often looks like a solution looking for a problem. It's too unreliable, slow, dumb, and too expensive for a lot of the tasks companies would like to use it for.

They're the new WYSIWYG/low-code. Everyone that doesn't fully understand the problem space thinks they're some ultimate solution that is going to revolutionise everything. People that do are responding with a resounding 'meh'. Stable Diffusion is a great example. Something that can generate consistent game assets would be an absolute game changer for the entire game industry and open up a new wave of high tech indie game development, but despite every \"oh wow\" demo hitting the front page of HN, we've had the tech for a couple of years now and the only thing that's come out of it is some janky half solutions (3D meshes from pictures that are unworkable in real games, still no way to generate assets in consistent styles without a huge amount of complex tinkering) and a bunch of fucking hentai lol. reply skydhash 4 hours agorootparentHuman work is much more deterministic than AI as it encompasses a lot more constraints than what the task specified. If you take concept art creations, while the brief may be a few sentences, the artist knows to respect anatomy and perspective rules, as well as some common definitions (when the brief says ship, you know that it’s the ship concept approved last week). As an artist, I’ve used reference pictures, dolls, 3d renders and one of the most aspect these tools had was consistency. I don’t see Large Models be consistent without another models applying constraint to what they’re capable of producing, like rules defining correct anatomy and extracting data that defines a character. The fact is we do have tools like MakeHuman [0], Marvelous Designer [1], and others that let you generate ideas that are consistent in their flexibility. I look at Copilot and it’s been the same for me. I’m either working on a huge codebase and most of the time, it means tweaking and refactoring, which is not something I trust a LLM with. Or it’s a greenfield project and I usually write only the necessary code for a task and boilerplate generation is not a thing for me. Coding for me is like sculpting and LLM-based solutions feel like trying to do with bricks attached to my feet.

We've crossed the threshold where something like Magic the Gathering could be recreated by a tiny team and a low budget. I don't think the limiting factor here is the software; it looks like we got AI-generated art pretty much as soon as consumer graphics cards could handle it (10 years ago it would have been quite hard). I'd be measuring progress in hardware generations not years and from that perspective Stable Diffusion is young. reply callalex 4 hours agorootparentCurrent AI is entirely incapable of generating the balanced and fun/engaging rule sets required for a MtG style game.

Instead of wasting all the compute on bitcoin we pretrain fully open models which can run on people's hardware. A 120b ternary model is the most interesting thing in the world. No one can train one now because you need a billion dollar super computer. reply mirekrusin 2 hours agorootparentSETI made sense because there is a lot of data where you download chunk and do expensive computation and return thin result. Model training is unlike that. It's large state that is constantly updated and updates require full, up to date state. This means you cannot distribute it efficiently over slow network with many smaller workers. That's why NVIDIA is providing scalable clusters with specialized connectivity so they have ultra low latency and massive throughput. Even in those setups it takes ie. a month to train base model. Converted to distributed setup this same task would take billions of years - ie. it's not feasible. There aren't any known ways of contributing computation without access to the full state. This would require completely different architecture, not only \"different than transformers\" but \"different than gradient descent\", which would be basically creating new branch in machine learning and starting from zero. Safe bet is on \"ain't going to happen\" - better to focus on current state of art and keep advancing it until it builds itself and anything else we can dream of to reach this \"mission fucking accomplished\". reply mejutoco 32 minutes agorootparentThat is the challenging part indeed. But if we think of mixture of experts models outperforming \"monolithic\" models, why not? Maybe instead of 8 you can do 1000 and that is easy to paralellize. It sounds worth exploring to me. reply sigmoid10 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's wrong. What you described is data parallelism and it would indeed be very tricky to e.g. sync gradients across machines. But this is not the only method of training neural nets (transformers or any other kind) in parallel. If we'd like to train, say, a human brain complexity level model with 10^15 parameters, we'd need a model parallelism approach anyways. It introduces a bit of complexity since you need to make sure that each distributed part of the model can run individually with roughly the same amount of compute, but you no longer need to worry about syncing anything (or have the entire state of anything on one machine). The real questions is if you can find enough people to run this who will never be able to run it themselves in the end, because inference alone will still require a supercluster. If you have access to that, you might as well train something on it today. reply mirekrusin 19 minutes agorootparentLack of data parallelism is implied by computation that is performed. You gradient descend on your state. Each step needs to work on up to date state otherwise you're computing gradient descend from state that doesn't exist anymore and your computed gradient descent delta is nonsensical if applied to the most recent state (it was calculated on old one, direction that your computation calculated is now wrong). You also can't calculate it without having access to the whole state. You have to do full forward and backward pass and mutate weights. There aren't any ways of slicing and distributing that make sense in terms of efficiency. The reason is that too much data at too high frequency needs to be mutated and then made readable. That's also the reason why nvidia is focusing so much on hyper efficient interconnects - because that's the bottleneck. Computation itself is way ahead of in/out data transfer. Data transfer is the main problem and going in the direction of architecture that dramatically reduces it by several orders of magnitude is just not the way to go. If somebody solves this problem it'll mean they solved much more interesting problem – because it'll mean you can locally uptrain model and inject this knowledge into bigger one arbitrarily. reply ImprobableTruth 5 hours agorootparentprevTransmission speeds aren't fast enough for this, unless you crank up the batch size ridiculously high. reply monkeydust 42 minutes agorootparentprevReminded me of Petals offering distributed ML inference anyone tried this? https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals reply kleinsch 5 hours agorootparentprevPeople are estimating that Meta is buying $8-10B in GPUs this year alone. https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/01/18/mark-zuckerberg-indicate... reply loeg 5 hours agorootparentYeah, certainly within an order of magnitude of that number. reply __loam 5 hours agorootparentprevI would expect most of the big tech firms have the capital to build a gpu cluster like that. reply vishnugupta 4 hours agoparentprev\"Decentralised\" AI probably means something to do with crypto.

Meanwhile the FOMC is openly talking about looser labor markets via open market operations (that's direct government interference in free labor markets to suppress wages for the pro-capitalism folks, think a little about what capitalism is supposed to mean if you are ok with this), and this against the backdrop of an election between two men having trouble campaigning effectively because one is fighting off dozens of lawsuits including multiple felony charges and the other is flying back and forth between Kiev and Tel Aviv trying to manage two wars he can't seem to manage: IIRC Biden is in Ukraine right now trying to keep Zelenskyy from drone-bombing any more refineries of Urals crude because `CL` or whatever is up like 5% in the last three weeks which is really bad in an election year looking to get nothing but uglier: is anyone really arguing that some meme on /r/crypto is what's pushing e.g. BTC and not a pretty shaky-looking Fed? Meanwhile over in crypto land, over the same period of time that AI and other marquee Valley tech has been turning into a scandal-plagued orgy of ugly headlines on a nearly daily basis, the regulators have actually been getting serious about sending bad actors to jail or leaning on them with the prospect (SBF, CZ), major ETFs and futures serviced by reputable exchanges (e.g. CME) have entered mainstream portfolios, and a new generation of exchanges (`dy/dx`, Vertex, Apex, Orderly) backed by conventional finance investments in robust bridge infrastructure (LayerZero) are now doing standard Island/ARCA-style efficient matching and then using the blockchain for what it's for: printing a consolidated, Reg NMS/NBBO/SIP-style consolidated tape. As a freelancer I don't really have a dog in this fight, I judge projects by feasibility, compensation, and minimum ick factor. From the vantage point of my flow the AI projects are sketchier looking on average and below market bids on average contrasted to the blockchain projects, a stark reversal from even six months ago.

I don't think much of the AI startup scene or socials groups like e/acc would have existed if it weren't for the tech that they just gave away for free. Its interesting how Stability AI and their VC funding have done a much better job of acting effectively as a non-profit charity (because they don't have profits. lol) to speed up AI development and open source their results as compared to other companies that were supposed to have been doing that from the beginning. They really were the true ActuallyOpenAI.

At least the open source AI people have code that you can use, freely without restriction. The doomers, on the other hand, don't do anything but try and fail to prevent other people from releasing useful stuff. But, in some sense I should be thanking the doomers because I rather that people with such incompetence were the enemy as opposed to people who might have a chance of succeeding. reply janalsncm 2 hours agorootparentNot being e/acc doesn’t make one a doomer.

But the actual results of all of this is memes and people making cool startups. Regardless of whether a couple people who are taking their own jokes too seriously truly believe that they are going to, I don't know, create magic AGI, the fact remains that the actual measurable results of all this is only: 1: funny memes 2: cool AI startups Anything other than that is made up stuff in either your head, or the heads of people who just want to pump up the valuation of their startups. > Marc Andreessen’s manifesto Yes, I'm sure he says a lot of things that will convince people to invest in companies that he also invests in. It is an effective marketing tactic. I'm sure he has convinced other VCs to invest in his companies because of these marketing slogans. But regardless of what a couple people say to hype up their startup investments, that is unrelated to the actual real world outcomes of all of this. > you wouldn’t need a new term for it The fact that me and you are talking about it, actually proves that yes some marketing terms both make a difference and also don't result in, I don't know, the government being overthrown and replaced by libertarian VCs or whatever nonsense that people are worried about. reply jrflowers 1 hour agorootparentprev>You are taking the memes way too seriously.

They could have stopped at any time. Google nailed high traffic from the beginning, so ad sales was always a safe Plan B. The founders hoped to find something more aesthetic to them, failed, and the conservative path worked. The reason I write this is misleading is b/c this is very different from a ZIRP YC era thinking that seems in line with your suggestion: - Ex: JustinTV used their VC $ to pivot into Twitch, and if that didn't work, game over. - Ex: Uber raised bigger & bigger VC rounds until self-driving cars could solve their margins / someone else figured it out. They seem to be figuring out their margins, but it was a growing disaster and unclear if they could with such an unpredictable miracle. In contrast, both Amazon & Google were in positions of huge cash flows and being able to switch to highly profitable growth at any time. They were designed to control their destinies, vs have bankers/VCs dictate them. reply bamboozled 5 hours agorootparentprevI am quite sure Google had a lot to offer from day one, which is why they were encouraged to start the business.

[0] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stability-ai-ceo-no-human-193... reply bruce511 5 hours agoparentI think when parsing that statement it's important to understand his (and your) definition of \"programmer\". We (I) tend to use the term \"programmer\" in a generic way, encompassing a bunch of tasks waaay beyond \"just typing in new code\". Whereas I suspect he used it in the narrowest possible definition (literally, code-typer). My day job (which I call programming) consists of needs analysis, data-modelling, workflow and UI design, coding, documenting, presenting, iterating, debugging, extending, and cycling through this loop multiple times. All while collaborating with customers, managers, co-workers, check-writers and so on. AI can do -some- of that. And it can do small bits of it really well. It will improve in some of the other bits. Plus, a new job description will appear- \"prompt engineer\". As an aside I prefer the term \"software developer \" for what I do, I think it's a better description than \"programmer\". Maybe one day there'll be an AI that can do software development. Developers that don't need to eat, sleep, or take a piss. But not today.

And don't they want to arrest someone for having the child porn to train it on? reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentThere's two controversies that are the opposite of each other. 1. Some people are mad that Stable Diffusion might be trained on CSAM because the original list of internet images they started with turned out to link to some. (LAION doesn't actually contain images, just links to them.) This one isn't true, because they removed NSFW content before training. 2. Some other people are mad that they removed NSFW content because they think it's censorship. That actually isn't the legal issue I meant though. It's not that they trained on it, it's that it contains adult material at all (and can be shown to children easily), and that it can be used to generate simulated CSAM, which some but not all countries are just as unhappy about. reply SV_BubbleTime 5 hours agoparentprevI don’t know if that is a factor. But the dog whistle is “safety”. reply anonylizard 5 hours agoparentprevThat 'anti-adult tirade' is a strategic choice. 1.

Brian Potter Mar 04, 2024 111 Share this post Why Is It So Hard to Build an Airport? www.construction-physics.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 33 Share Airports are a critical piece of modern infrastructure. Aviation contributes an estimated 8% to global GDP through direct and indirect effects (ie: the businesses and commerce that it enables), and an estimated 25% of companies’ sales rely on air transport. In 2022, civil aviation in the US flew over 850 million passengers, generated more than a trillion dollars in economic activity, and was responsible for most long-distance inter-city trips. All this was made possible by 550 commercial airports, the largest 50 of which handle more than 80% of air traffic.1 Despite their importance, airports are enormously difficult to build, not only in the US but around the world. Airport construction is nearly always vigorously opposed by various interest groups, often successfully. As air travel greatly expanded in the 1960s and 70s, there were “no more virulent domestic conflicts… in the advanced industrial world than those over airport construction.” In her history of US airports in the second half of the 20th century, Janet Bednarek notes that building a new airport was so “extraordinarily difficult…that very few completely new major commercial airports were constructed.\" Of the 50 largest airports in the US, the average age is 82 years, and only three have been built in the last 50 years. The US has built more commercial nuclear reactors in the past 25 years (two) than it has major commercial airports (none), even though air travel increased by almost 50% over that period. “Major” means annual traffic exceeding 1 million passengers per year. Via FAA, Wikipedia. What makes it so hard to build an airport? And how has the US managed to accommodate increased air travel in spite of this difficulty? Let’s take a look. Jet aircraft and the beginnings of modern air travel Commercial air travel has been around since 1914, but for most of its early history airplanes were a niche mode of transportation, compared to trains or ships. It wasn’t until 1955 that more people traveled in the US by air than by train, and 1957 that air travel surpassed sea travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It was the invention of the jet airliner that transformed air travel into the ubiquitous mode of transportation that it is today. Boeing’s 707 first flew in 1957, followed shortly by the Douglas DC-8, and by 1963 air travel miles in the US exceeded both railroads and buses combined. Between 1955 (shortly before the first jet US airliners debuted) and 1985, air travel in the US increased from just over 40 million annual passengers to more than 400 million. This enormous increase in air traffic driven by jet airliners required greatly expanding civil aviation infrastructure. Not only did airports need to be enlarged to handle the rise in passengers and aircraft moving through them, but jet airliners required much longer runways to take off and land than propeller planes did. Lockheed’s Constellation, a 4-engine propeller airliner which entered service in 1943, needed a 6000 foot-long runway, but the Boeing 707 needed more than 10,000 feet at full takeoff weight, as did the Boeing 747 which followed 10 years later. In 1957 an American Airlines executive stated that not a single airport the company flew to could fully accommodate the new jets, either because of insufficient runway length or insufficient terminal facilities. Many believed that the new jet airliners would require their own special “jetports” built specifically to accommodate them. Expanding aviation infrastructure to handle jets proved difficult. The most important reason was noise. Residents near airports had long complained about the noise from planes: in 1948, when what would become JFK International opened, residents from 18 civic organizations protested the noise from low flying planes. But noise from jet aircraft proved to be a much more severe problem. The Air Force jets under development in the 1950s were expected to be “the loudest man-made industrial noise up to now.” And while tests of commercial jet aircraft showed that they weren’t necessarily noisier than comparable prop airplanes (tests comparing the 707 to the Lockheed Constellation measured similar noise levels), the high-pitched frequencies of jet engine noise were discovered to be far more disturbing to human ears than piston engines were. And because of the longer takeoff and landing distances, a jet airliner would expose many more people to noise than a piston engined aircraft. Relative annoyance of different aircraft at different decibel levels. To be comparably disturbing to piston engines, the early jet engines had to be 15 decibels quieter. Via Link. Noise levels at different distances of different transportation modes. Via Politics of Airport Noise. Early on, it was hoped that people would simply get used to the sounds of jet airliners, and accept them as the price of progress. In 1961, the FAA put out a pamphlet, “The Sounds of the 20th Century,” aimed at explaining why jet engines made noise, and emphasizing the many benefits that air transportation brought, in the hopes that understanding would breed acceptance. When questioned about aircraft noise by a US congressman in 1962, the head of the FAA stated that “we feel the statement that people must live with noise is realistic in the light of our growing society using complex means of transportation and communication. Noise in urban America is one of the prices paid for progress and economic growth.\" But despite these hopes, it was clear to most that jet noise was a serious problem, with the “potential to impede air commerce in the USA”. A year after the introduction of the first commercial jets, congressional hearings were held on aircraft noise problems, and the following year the FAA acknowledged that the introduction of jet airliners had led to “a substantial increase in the number of complaints from persons in the airport environment, as well as adverse community reaction to turbojet noise at a number of major airports.” Jet noise became such a problem at LAX that appraisals for property values near the airport dropped as much as 20% Jet airliners were also introduced during a time when citizens were increasingly skeptical of progress at any cost, and of the decisions made by unaccountable government technocrats. Opposition to airports was joined by opposition against highway construction, dams, nuclear reactors, and other technology and infrastructure that activists felt was misdirected progress. Noise began to be considered another harmful pollutant by the burgeoning environmental movement. Citizens increasingly filed lawsuits against airports for damages, in some cases even attempting injunctions to stop the use of jets. In 1961, 800 homeowners in Queens sued the Port Authority for $2 million in damages from aircraft noise, though the suit was ultimately discontinued for lack of funds. In 1966, one irate housewife threatened to blow up JFK’s aircraft control tower. The FAA was so concerned about reactions to jet noise in Washington DC that it didn’t authorize jets to land there until 1966. In response to political pressure, jet noise bills were continually introduced in congress, and in 1968 a bill was passed that authorized the FAA to include noise levels as part of its criteria for certifying new aircraft. By the time the FAA bill passed, technology was already helping to solve the noise problem. The first generation of jet airliners used turbojet engines, in which air enters the engine, gets compressed, burned, and is exhausted out at supersonic speed. It was this supersonic exhaust which created the lion’s share of jet engine noise. But in the late 1950s, a new type of jet engine was developed, the turbofan. Unlike the turbojet (where all the air enters the combustion chamber and is burned) a turbofan has a large fan mounted to the front that pulls air into the engine but around the combustion chamber (because this air bypasses the combustion chamber, turbofans are also called bypass engines). The turbofan extracted much more energy from the hot exhaust of the combustion chamber, leading to a colder exhaust stream. Not only was this more fuel efficient (jet engines are most efficient when the speed of their exhaust matches the cruising speed of the aircraft), but they were much quieter than turbojets. By 1961, turbofans had replaced turbojets on all new commercial jets. And while turbofans were being developed, NASA was conducting research on technologies that could be used to quiet jet engines, such as redesigned engine nacelles and fan blades. As a result of this technology and research, and of slowly increasing stringency of FAA noise regulations after 1968, the noise of jet engines steadily fell. Airliner noise over time. Via “Aircraft Noise Technology For The 21st Century.” But the decreasing noise of individual jet engines was partially offset by continuously rising jet traffic. In 1960, just 16 airports in the US had jet service; by 1970, that had risen to more than 300. Between 1962 and 1970, the number of jet aircraft used by US airlines rose by a factor of five. And the more passengers on a jet, the harder the engines had to work, and the more noise they made. Despite improvements from turbofans and other technology, complaints against jet noise showed no signs of abating. In the two years after jets were introduced at National Airport (now Ronald Reagan) in Washington DC, the FAA received more than 6000 letters from angry citizens. By 1968, LAX was facing three billion dollars in lawsuits over jet noise. By 1972, noise in the US (much of it jet related) generated more complaints than “any other pollutant or threat to the environment,” and experts worried that “violent civil disobedience at airports [was] a real possibility in the near future.” In the mid-1970s, millions of people were exposed to average aircraft noise levels exceeding 65 decibels (the level at which noise is the “most important adverse aspect of the environment”), and airports around the country were facing hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits.2 Besides improving engine technology, other solutions to the noise problem could likewise only partially address the issue. Airports could route planes over less inhabited areas, but there was often limited ability to do this. At JFK, for instance, the Port Authority tried to limit takeoffs to runways which faced over the water, but this wasn’t possible if traffic was high enough or winds weren’t favorable. Airports could also mandate takeoff and landing procedures that minimized noise impact, such as “low altitude, reduced power climbs, [and] higher angles of descent,\" but pilots resisted many of these, claiming they were unsafe. Reduced noise procedures were thought to be responsible for at least one crash at JFK. Legal rulings and federal government policy also constrained how airports and municipalities could address problems of aircraft noise. Courts had established that exposing a property to aircraft noise constituted a “taking” that required compensation (dating from a 1946 case in which low-flying military jets caused a farmer's chickens to kill themselves as they ran into the walls in fright). And they had also established that airport owners were responsible for the noise that they generated. But even as the courts assigned responsibility for noise to airports, they greatly restricted what airports could do about it. Airport rules that limited night takeoffs and landings, for instance, were often overturned, with courts ruling that air traffic fell under the jurisdiction of the FAA. Zoning rules near airports that might limit noise exposure were also often struck down as not beneficial to the general public. And though airports lobbied for a federal noise abatement policy (in part to reduce their own liability), the government resisted, and the FAA carefully structured its aircraft noise rules to avoid taking any responsibility for implementing noise restrictions. Ultimately airports were left with little choice but to install soundproofing in residences near airports, and to acquire parcels of land via eminent domain that were too affected by noise. This often resulted in airports buying hundreds or even thousands of homes in adjacent areas and demolishing them. LAX, for instance, bought and demolished the entire town of Surfridge. By the 1980s, airports around the country were spending $100 million per year on noise abatement, most of which went towards acquiring land parcels. Over time, FAA noise standards have gotten more stringent, noisier aircraft have gradually been phased out, and aircraft noise has steadily decreased. But tolerance for noise seems to be falling faster, and by most accounts airport noise continues to be the most important issue limiting airport construction. Decline of population exposed to noise levels over time, via NAS. Ideally, the noise problem would be solved simply by building an airport far from any heavily populated areas. But this has also proved difficult. While some airports, such as Chicago’s Midway, Boston Logan, and New York’s LaGuardia were built close (or even within) the cities they served (before jets made such construction infeasible), many others were built far from the city, only to have the city eventually expand around it. O’Hare (which began as an aircraft factory for Douglas Aircraft in WWII) was originally built on farmland relatively far from Chicago, but post-war sprawl pushed development outward, and by the late 1960s O’Hare had some of the most severe noise problems in the country. Denver International Airport was likewise deliberately built far from Denver on an enormous empty plot of land in a partially successful attempt to minimize noise issues. And an airport can’t be too far from a city and remain useful, since travelers need to access the city, workers need to be within commuting distance, and so on. In Canada, Mirabel airport was built 35 miles from Montreal, surrounded by a 79,000 acre buffer zone to prevent any issues of incompatible land use. Mirabel was expected to replace Dorval (today Montreal-Trudeau) as Canada’s main eastern airport, but, in part because of its long distance from the city, this never happened, and Mirabel stopped serving passenger traffic in 2004. In addition to the noise problem, this sheer size of airports makes building them near cities difficult. Though early airfields were often small (when Chicago Midway opened, it took up just 80 acres, and by the 1950s it was the busiest airport in the world on 650 acres of space), a modern airport needs thousands of acres. Runways are two miles or more in length, and require thousands of feet of space between them to allow simultaneous landing of planes. This, along with the additional land needed to be acquired as a noise buffer, means that airports are “the largest land using facilities on the urban periphery,” often the size of a city in their own right. In the early 1980s, Dallas Fort-Worth Airport covered as much land as the city of Dallas did, and Denver International Airport is as large as the city of San Francisco. In addition to the difficulty of finding this much space, an airport perversely both creates demand for more housing (for the workers, along with whatever increase in commerce the airport causes) while removing thousands of acres of space for it. The noise problem means that building a new airport is strongly resisted by local residents. But residents aren’t the only ones opposing airport construction. They’re also fought by environmentalists. In addition to the noise they generate, the size of airports means building one will encroach on what might be ecologically valuable areas such as forests or wetlands, damaging them even if they’re just used for a noise buffer (the risk of bird strikes means that the ideal airport is one surrounded by “sterilized fields” where birds aren’t inclined to nest). The huge amount of jet fuel that flows through an airport creates the risk of leaks and spills. Decades of fuel spills at JFK resulted in a “vast lake of jet fuel” beneath the airport, anywhere from 5 million to 9 million gallons in size. Environmental opposition has thus been a major factor in limiting airport construction. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club have opposed new airports at Palmdale in California and near Minneapolis in Minnesota. Environmental opposition stopped both the expansion of JFK (which would require filling in portions of Jamaica Bay) and the construction of a new fourth airport in the New York region. It stopped a small training facility near the Everglades from becoming the largest airport in the world. Environmental opposition to airports has been greatly aided by the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in 1969: NEPA has been leveraged to oppose, among other things, the construction of the Denver International Airport, and the expansion of Oakland, Anchorage, and O’Hare airports. New airport construction is also often resisted by airlines themselves, which have invested significant money in their terminal facilities at existing airports. Similarly, where airlines have a “fortress hub” (an airport whose traffic is mostly captured by a single airline), they will often resist new airports as a threat to their dominance. Delta, for instance, opposed the construction of a new airport in Atlanta that would have been used by Southwest Airlines. The factors that make it hard to build a new airport also make it hard to expand an existing airport. Often, urban encroachment means an airport has no feasible room to grow, like at Chicago’s Midway and New York’s La Guardia. If it is possible to expand, such expansion will invariably be protested vigorously by residents and environmental groups. Protest against expansion of JFK by filling in Jamaica Bay has kept the airport at roughly the same size since it was first built in 1948. The construction of an additional runway at Boston Logan was successfully resisted for over 30 years, and a new runway at Sea-Tac was resisted for 16 years. Local and environmental opposition prevented the expansion of LAX in the late 1990s. Chicago had such a difficult time overcoming opposition to expanding O’Hare that it asked the federal government to force such an expansion through legislation. A GAO report found that, on average, it took 10 to 15 years for a US airport to complete a new runway. And airports around the world don’t seem to fare much better. Heathrow in London has been trying for more than 50 years to add a third runway. And while between 2008 and 2016, the 4000+ commercial airports around the world added around 400 new runways, zero runways were added at the top 100 airports by traffic (which handle roughly half of all air travel). Via GAO. Their enormous size, along with their noise and other negative environmental impacts, makes a new airport the ultimate in NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) infrastructure: people are fine with having an airport, but will fiercely resist having an airport built near them. Most NIMBY difficulties stem from the asymmetric nature of the costs and benefits of a new project: a new apartment building, for instance, will benefit a city overall (slightly lowering housing costs and slightly increasing the size of the city’s labor market), but those benefits are diffuse. The costs, on the other hand – traffic, parking, construction disruption – will be borne almost entirely by the surrounding residents, who will thus rationally oppose it. An airport pushes this dynamic to the extreme. The disruption to the immediate area is immense, due to the size of the airport and the negative impacts of noise, not to mention the increased traffic that an airport generates. The benefits, on the other hand, are diffuse. While the region and state benefit from the economic activity the airport generates, many of the benefits of an airport accrue to the entire country, in the form of a better functioning aviation system, with fewer delays to passengers nationwide. Expanding capacity at O’Hare might reduce congestion at other hubs far from the city of Chicago. Similarly, not only are many of the users of an airport tourists who don’t live in the area, but at hub airports they might merely pass through without interacting with the local region at all. Unlike much other US infrastructure, modern, large airports that serve commercial jets only became needed as the environmental movement gained steam and building things in general became hard. Thus, building a major commercial airport has always been difficult: there has never been a \"golden age of airport building.\" Strategies for increasing air traffic Given the difficulty of building or expanding airports, how has the US (and other countries) managed to steadily expand the volume of air traffic without catastrophic congestion? For one, despite the difficulty, airports have been able to add new runways. Between 2000 and 2015, 21 of the busiest airports in the country added 18 runways and extended 7 runways. This is important, as an additional runway brings more capacity gain than any other sort of airport improvement. Airports have also rebuilt their infrastructure to squeeze more capacity without needing any additional land area. Airports such as JFK, Atlanta-Hartsfield, and O’Hare, for instance, have removed cross-runways and added parallel runways to allow for simultaneous landing of aircraft, increasing the volume of aircraft the airport can handle. Airports have also been able to build more terminals and more gates, and added technologies like jetways, automatic baggage handlers, and people movers that move people through the airport faster. Evolution of runway layout at JFK over time. Via The Metropolitan Airport An important measure of airport capacity is “plane movements” – how many takeoffs and landings an airport can support over a period of time. This is typically limited by runway capacity. But even if no runways are added and the number of plane movements remains fixed, capacity can be increased by raising the number of passengers per plane. Many airports, for instance, created policies to discourage general aviation aircraft, freeing up room for higher-capacity commercial planes. In 1968 the New York Port Authority greatly increased the landing fees for small aircraft, which resulted in general aviation traffic declining by 30% over the next few months. This was followed by the FAA imposing quotas on general aviation traffic at five major airports, which had a similar effect. Similarly, commercial aircraft have steadily gotten larger over time. In the 1960s, international routes were limited to the Boeing 707 or the DC-8, which had a maximum capacity of 174 and 269 passengers respectively, but the 1970s saw the introduction of the Boeing 747 which initially could seat 366 passengers. And besides introducing new, larger models, individual models also got larger over time: stretching an aircraft to get more passengers has long been a strategy for aircraft builders. When the 737 was first introduced, it had a capacity of up to 130 passengers. Today, a 737-MAX10 can have up to 230 passengers. And average aircraft capacity seems to still be rising: between 2000 and 2016, average seat capacity on flights around the world increased by 31%. Airlines have also gotten better at filling their aircraft to capacity. In 1970, commercial aircraft were on average just 49% full. Today, that has risen to more than 80%. These all increase the number of passengers transported per airplane, and thus allows more passenger volume from the same number of runways. As airports have become congested, traffic has often shifted towards other airports that have more capacity. Inability to add capacity has caused Boston Logan to begin redirecting traffic to other, regional airports. This sort of shift is often facilitated by the hub-and-spoke network of US air travel: since the hub isn’t the final destination, it's often possible for airlines to shift routes to go through different hubs if one becomes congested. As O’Hare became congested, for instance, some airlines shifted routes to other hubs at St. Louis and Denver. Finally, capacity can be increased by changes in air traffic control and how planes are routed. Significant congestion issues at European airports in the late 1980s were resolved by improvements to the air traffic control system. In the US, the NextGen air traffic control program was created to expand air transportation capacity, which does things like researching wake turbulence to see if required aircraft separation distances can be safely reduced. Similarly, airport congestion often only occurs at limited peak hours, and capacity can be increased by shifting flights to non-peak hours (though airline resistance might make this difficult). One benefit that airports do have for increasing capacity is that, unlike many other aspects of the air transportation system, they’re very profitable. Airports have “extremely high credit ratings” (Fitch lists several major airports as having various levels of “A” credit), and can easily finance their expansion via issuing bonds. So financing airport infrastructure is a comparatively smaller problem than it is for things like mass transit. Nevertheless, the air travel system seems to be constantly bumping up against its capacity limits, especially in places like New York which have high traffic and limited ability to expand. Severe flight delays occurred across the country in the late 60s, the late 1980s and the late 1990s. Airbus, in fact, based its development of the enormous A380 on the expectation that limited airport capacity meant that airlines would have no choice but to use fewer, larger planes. (The fact that this didn’t happen, and airlines instead chose to buy thousands of smaller aircraft like the 737 MAX, apparently successfully, is something I don’t quite understand.) Conclusion Air travel is an interesting dichotomy. On the one hand, building the infrastructure for it is unbelievably difficult. Airports are incredibly hard to build, aircraft are incredibly hard to make a profit selling, airlines are frequently going bankrupt. And yet this hasn’t stopped air travel from steadily becoming cheaper, safer, more convenient and more ubiquitous. The pre-jet era, when aircraft and airports could be developed without spending billions of dollars, was also the era where air travel was noisy, inconvenient, and reserved for a relatively small number of people. It was somehow brought to the masses, transformed from a miracle to a modern convenience even as every aspect of it steadily got closer and closer to being impossible to achieve.

While reading this article, I thought about something like that too. Build an airport quite a while away from the big city, and provide a high-speed, maybe even maglev train there. Make it free for customers. Also, make it very inconvenient for passengers and staff to approach the airport by other means, only allow cargo delivery there through the road network.

Or go one step further and just put on barriers to block the trains too. Don't let anyone near the airport unless they walk/bike the few miles. That will drive up servicing costs but will dramatically lower congestion. If don't correctly, virtually nobody will ever get to the airport.

Even if you live \"near an airport\", you probably live 15+ miles from an airport. Tottenham London to Heathrow is 24 miles by car. The British Museum to Heathrow is 19 miles. Columbia University on the Upper West Side to JFK is 17 miles. DC to Dulles is 26 miles. Downtown Denver is 25 miles to the airport. SF to SFO is 14 miles. LA to LAX is 20 miles. The Loop in Chicago to O'Hare is 17 miles. Dallas to DFW is 21 miles. Houston is 22 miles. Seattle to SeaTac is 15 miles. Most cities don't have airports that close to the city. Maybe you live in San Diego and the airport is right there downtown, but most people are traveling to get to their airport. Ok, maybe you don't want to take a train and can hire an airport van or whatever, but you're likely traveling a distance to get to an airport. I'm not saying that it isn't nice to have a more convenient airport, but if we're being realistic about climate change air travel is going to have to be something we do sparingly rather than often. People in the US, UK, Germany, and France currently emit an average of 15t, 5t, 8t, and 5t of CO2 respectively. A trip from NYC to London will be 2t of CO2 - which probably needs to be around 40% of your annual CO2 budget. That is to say, an inconvenient airport should be an inconvenience very few times per year. Making other things in your life more conveniently located should be a much higher priority - the things you'll use daily, weekly, or monthly. An airport is something you'll use infrequently - or will have to use infrequently if we're going to be realistic about climate change. Plus, as I noted, 30 miles isn't really that inconvenient compared to current situations in most cities. Even the \"close\" airport in London is 20+ miles away from most of London. Is there a huge difference between 20 miles and 30 miles? That's less than a 10 minute difference by car. With a high-speed train it could be a lot less. Paris to Lyon on the TGV averages 167 MPH. At that speed, 30 miles is covered in 11 minutes. I certainly understand the desire for convenience, but airports are something individual people use infrequently (or will have to use infrequently given the reality of climate change). If getting to the airport is annoying, it's probably not an annoyance in your life frequently. reply rangestransform 14 hours agorootparentI will vote against whoever tried to make my flights less convenient reply com2kid 13 hours agorootparentSo demand rail service that drops you off inside the airport right at the security line. Demand baggage pick-up and delivery services be offered. Having someone pick up your checked luggage the day before you fly out, walking off a train right into the airport, and then getting on the plane w/o any fuss, is amazing. VS the American Standard of waiting in a huge line to weigh your checked luggage, that you just paid an Uber 60-80 to carry for you. reply dukeyukey 8 hours agorootparentprevThen the new airport will never get built, it'll get horribly congested, and your flights will still be less convenient.

It costs max around $20 USD. > I don't want to travel 30 miles if my plane get cancelled. My local airport (Sea-tac) is almost 30 miles from Seattle. It can easily take an hour driving to get there. I do agree that taking lots of luggage onto the light rail (WHICH DOESN'T DROP YOU OFF IN THE AIRPORT!!) is a bad idea. But I am one of those people who despises checked luggage, since it can add another 30+ minutes to checking in. Compared to carry-on and TSA pre-check, where I can walk into the airport, through security, and be at my boarding gate in under 10 minutes. But hey, Seattle is, as much as I love it, not a world class American city. Let's try NYC. It can take over an hour to get from midtown Manhattan to JFK driving. It also takes over an hour on the subway. Oops, another bad example. You know what, I am starting to think flying out of Boston Logan[1] is pretty nice. But seriously, if you want a huge international airport, you need a lot of land, and you don't want to put that smack dab in the middle of a city, unless the land got paid for long ago, and even then, you'll be stuck with an airport that you cannot expand. Meanwhile a train from Tokyo to Narita Airport is under 20 minutes. [1] I legit like flying out of Boston Logan, the big dig was expensive but wow was it effective.

Looking at it a bit more holistically and seeing the growth of the DFW metroplex from 1980-now though, I think it makes sense for DFW airport to have succeeded. Having the very centralized airport with (theoretically) good rail service to both major cities makes a heck of a lot of sense and have been a good thing for the DFW economy. It would be nearly impossible to build the airport as it is now post that growth, but there's a good chance it wouldn't have survived in the early days given how far out there it was in 1979.

They ended up spending about 2 billion to clean up the rocky mountain arsenal to make it a wildlife refuge and meet all those standards, and spent five billion on Denver international airport. I'd imagine the environmental cleanup would have been substantially cheaper if they just devoted that swath of land (much nearer to downtown Denver actually) for the airport and devoted the swath of unpolluted land Denver airport presently sits on for a wildlife area, maybe one that won't end up being hemmed on all sides by Denver suburbia in time like the present rocky mountain arsenal.

Boston's population is technically only 650k but Boston proper doesn't even include Cambridge which is like not including one of the boroughs when talking about NYC's population.

There was a ton of \"white flight\" in the US starting in the 60s with white middle class and above fleeing cities to the suburbs. As such, they specifically did not want their adjacent town to be annexed by the major city. In plays out pretty comically in Austin TX in my opinion. You have these teeny affluent enclaves (search for \"Sunset Valley\", \"Rollingwood\" and \"Westlake Hills\" near/inside Austin) that anyone else would consider \"part of Austin\", but they don't vote in city elections or pay city taxes (but they certainly take advantage of all the benefits of being close to Austin...) reply Al-Khwarizmi 19 hours agorootparentprevIn Spain it happens as well. The official city population numbers quoted by most sources are actually the population of the city's municipality. Sometimes municipalities are large, including rural areas and small towns close to the city, while other times they are smaller and leave outside areas that are effectively boroughs of the city (you walk down a street and are in a different municipality, without even going through any non-urban area). Some years ago there was a project to merge municipalities, focusing especially on cases like that, but it failed spectacularly because it required consent from all municipalities involved and the smaller ones never wanted to merge (partly because it's advantageous for them to not pay big city taxes but still use their services, but I suspect mainly because mayors don't want to just give up their position and go find another job). This makes rankings by population rather biased and spawns many endless discussions on whether city X is bigger than its rival city Y (and sometimes it might actually have real-life consequences, say, when the central government comes up with some funds for cities of size greater than some threshold). reply dukeyukey 3 hours agorootparentprevFrance does it too. Paris Proper has about 2 million people; the Paris metro area is about 10 million. China does it in reverse, they define a \"city\" which includes mostly farmland and rural areas, artificially upping city population figures. reply bombcar 17 hours agorootparentprevIt really depends on a number of factors: * Age of the city * Natural boundaries (rivers, mountains) * How government is setup, in some countries (and in some areas of countries) many things are done at the city level, others bump a lot up to county, state, or even country government.

Flights landing at Heathrow fly directly over central London (with great views of iconic buildings). It is technically possible to extend the runways somewhat but actually doing so is a planning / political nightmare. Heathrow is located just inside the M25 (the main London orbital motorway) immediately adjacent to the junction of the M25 and the M4 (the busy motorway that goes West from London). So not only is Heathrow virtually impossible to expand, it's in an area known for its horrendous rush-hour traffic. It does have a railway connection to central London, but this is a partially underground line with multiple stops (every few minutes in practice). Journeys to Heathrow from most places in the UK can be horrendous. Gatwick, London's second airport, is ~30 miles South of the city, and does have reasonably fast rail connections. Gatwick does have space for a new runway, but lots of factors have prevented this. reply bombcar 17 hours agorootparentMaking a runway longer only lets bigger planes land.

They'll happily tear stuff down and build a shiny new thing in its place. As I understand it the whole concept of green belt / urban conservation is also fairly minimal in the US mentality, so large land grabs for building and expansion of airports are easier in the US. Meanwhile, in Europe, most airports have history and grew organically. And the whole green belt / urban conservation thing is much stronger in Europe. For example, London Heathrow started off life as a single grass runway with a few simple buildings and grew organically over time. Its growth ultimately limited by the city that grew around it, and so you end up with for example the present controversial discussion over the possibility of a third runway.

Some nuance: > […] but not an actually useful park beyond sitting with a book or a smoke perhaps Yes, and grass to play improvised football or things like it. > chock full of amenities europeans would be lucky to have Not really, because European social life is not organized-activity-oriented. At least nowhere near my perception of American life (8y in CA). In Europe, you meet first (let’s hang out, meet at a cafe, in the park) and then roam around and maybe do something spontaneous. In many cases, this involves mixed ages (kids playing, grandparents etc). > Bathrooms Yes. To be fair, I think it depends on how urban it is. In bigger parks like Golden Gate Park SF, the homeless don’t bother to go that far. If you have bathrooms near urban centers they tend to get misused and scare away regular folks anyways. > To act like the greenspace is not available or unusuable doesn't speak to what is actually there for use today. The green space in the US wins overall (again based on mostly CA), if you commit to the car ride to get there. In fact, if you count the national/state parks it might be best in the world. In terms of green space integrated into urban life, I would say Europe is way better. In the US you can’t easily “integrate” green space that way into car-centric urban sprawl, because everything is already compartmentalized and divided and driving distance afar from other parts. reply sofixa 19 hours agorootparentprevI live in Paris and was recently in the US, and I strongly disagree - US cities have much less greenery, be it trees on the streets, mini parks or big parks.

Taking an airplane is the most convenient way. In Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France, and the UK taking a train is faster and more convenient (even if more expensive often) reply vel0city 17 hours agorootparentThe distances involved often lend themselves to air travel being more convenient even if there are trains. There's a sweet spot for distance where trains make the most sense, but after that a plane will end up being faster even with all the dead time at the airport. I live in Dallas. Door to door, a train would be faster and more convenient than a plane for me to go to Houston or Austin. A direct flight will always be faster and more convenient for me to go to Denver, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Orlando, Seattle, etc. Dallas to New York is ~1,400mi. That's like Madrid to Warsaw. It'll take me ~6 hours everything included to go that distance by plane. What's the travel itinerary for Madrid to Warsaw? Is it direct (same level of convenience)? Is it faster? reply jon_richards 17 hours agorootparentSome context, the Beijing–Kunming high-speed train takes 10 hours 43 minutes (including 6 intermediate stops) to travel 1,710 mi. reply pchristensen 17 hours agorootparentprevThe US is also much, much bigger. Germany is about the size of Nevada. France is about the size of the entire Eastern seaboard. The US would definitely be better served with better rail infrastructure, but there's no getting around the fact that Seattle to Boston is 200 miles longer than Lisbon to Moscow, and slightly longer than Edinburgh to Aleppo. reply TulliusCicero 17 hours agorootparentIf you look east of the Mississippi, the overall population densities aren't really that bad, and should be able to support high speed rail easily. ...except for the fact that within metro areas, US cities are designed in a very sprawly way that's hostile to public transit. This is an entirely unforced error that has nothing to do with geography and everything to do with culture. We deliberately chose to make our cities sprawly as fuck through various regulations. reply asdff 17 hours agorootparentA park and ride high speed rail system in those cities would probably stand on its own if it actually does save you time and cost. reply TulliusCicero 16 hours agorootparentPark and rides are somewhat of a stopgap measure. You really need walking/biking/bussing to rail to be effective last/first-mile options, in order for rail to be effective and popular too. reply asdff 16 hours agorootparentIts not perfect but that doesn't mean its the enemy of good, it can do a lot to reduce trips. Its also a drop in replacement for how a lot of people presently use their airports with long term economy parking lots, and it makes it a lot easier to justify connecting that up with more substantial transport down the line once you have that initial park and ride station. reply TulliusCicero 16 hours agorootparentYeah I'm not against them, but it's very much a modest, incremental measure, like going from no bike lanes to painted bike lanes in the door zone. You need much bigger changes to truly make HSR viable imo. reply asdff 16 hours agorootparentI imagine most anywhere that would get an hsr would also have a present day bus system that can have routing better oriented to serve the new infrastructure. Bike lanes are always nice but I imagine not very many people are going to want to start their inter city trip with luggage in tow trying to lug that around on a bike. reply TulliusCicero 14 hours agorootparentYou might be surprised. High speed rail isn't always about trips where you need a lot of luggage, and cargo bikes are popular in places with good bike infrastructure. Of course, the number of places with actually \"good\" bike infrastructure isn't very high. There's the Netherlands...and that's about it. And even the Netherlands doesn't really have \"great\" bike infrastructure as a standard (though it does have it in some places). reply philwelch 14 hours agorootparentprevThe Acela corridor is well suited for HSR. A few years ago Amtrak was trying to divest its long haul routes that lose money and reinvest in upgrading Acela, which would make it profitable. Unfortunately the plan fell through for political reasons. reply 7952 11 hours agoparentprevA lot of British airports emerged out of WWII air bases. I am not sure how they were chosen exactly. But they probably wanted places that were flat, dry and grassy with lots of space. They could have considered proximity to places that needed to be defended or suitability for launching attacks. And they knew that airfields were likely to be bombed. reply mc32 20 hours agoparentprevMost US airports were built early before we had the current population. When they began as airports, they were mostly on the periphery, with exceptions. reply ofrzeta 20 hours agoprevIn Munich/Germany plans for a new airport (as a successor to München/Riem) started in the 60s. Construction started in 1980. The airport went into operation in 1992. Obviously the people in the Erdinger Moos didn't like the decision to build the airport there and many lawsuits ensued that lead to a stop of the construction for three years. In the end and the last lawsuit I think there was no option of another appeal so that was that. In the end I think it just came down to a question of national interest where you can't have some individuals stop a project like this because an airport is needed in the area and it has to be built somewhere. reply michaelt 18 hours agoparent> you can't have some individuals stop a project like this because an airport is needed in the area and it has to be built somewhere. Environmentalist opponents of airport construction will often disagree with that premise - for example, pointing to the rise of videoconferencing and remote working. reply sofixa 19 hours agoprev> And an airport can’t be too far from a city and remain useful, since travelers need to access the city, workers need to be within commuting distance, and so on. In Canada, Mirabel airport was built 35 miles from Montreal, surrounded by a 79,000 acre buffer zone to prevent any issues of incompatible land use. Mirabel was expected to replace Dorval (today Montreal-Trudeau) as Canada’s main eastern airport, but, in part because of its long distance from the city, this never happened, and Mirabel stopped serving passenger traffic in 2004. It was because of very stupid mismanagement and lack of connections, not the distance. The old airport remained opened and continued serving domestic flights, while international ones were moved to Mirabel... which was extremely dumb because Montreal was the major interchange point between international arrivals and smaller locations not served directly by international flights in Canada. So most of the utility of Montreal airport was killed, and airlines started serving other airports in Canada to do the same thing. Also, there was no good link to the airport - it shouldn't have opened without a direct at least somewhat fast rail link, but it had no good road nor rail connection. Also, it was put in the wrong place - one of the potential locations was midway between Ottawa and Montreal and could have served both cities, but politicians decided they don't want that. reply jrockway 18 hours agoparentMontreal isn't the only city that failed with a too-far-away airport. Tokyo built Narita against much local opposition (they still check your ID before you're allowed inside the airport, to make sure you're not an angry local resident), and the opposition resulted in not being able to build the transport link they wanted (the Narita Shinkansen). The result is a good hour wasted on conventional rail to get to Tokyo. (Sky Access kind of fixed this, but I think it's limited to 160km/h and still takes 40 minutes.) Meanwhile, in the 2010s they expanded Haneda and started accepting international flights, and you can get to Tokyo via a variety of normal trains (and buses if your destination is on the Shinjuku side of things) in 15 minutes. The whole thing is landfill, so no residents to be mad either. Last time I flew to Haneda they made all the flights from the US arrive and depart at times when public transportation wasn't running, to discourage those flights, but it seems like they stopped doing that. So now it's more convenient for everyone, and Narita is largely pointless for everyone that isn't an extreme budget traveler (but I think Haneda built Terminal 3 for that use case... so... is there any reason for Narita to exist if you aren't visiting Chiba?) reply niklasrde 18 hours agorootparentArlanda feels like another good example of a \"far out\" (23 mi) airport that works pretty damn well. 18 minutes on the train. reply mayormcmatt 17 hours agorootparentArlanda is my favorite major-city airport. I'm not as well-traveled as many, but I've been to dozens and it's my favorite. I've transited between Stockholm, Norrtalje, and the airport in bus, tax, and train, with each being the easiest experience I've had with that respective form of transit. reply Jensson 17 hours agorootparentZurich Airport was much better for me, a few minutes to Zurich by train and they go every few minutes and tickets are cheap since those are the commuter trains. No need to plan, just go to the train station and hop on the first train and you are there in less than 10 minutes. It really blew my mind when I first visited, I never thought getting to a major international airport could be that convenient. Swiss transit is so well designed. reply Symbiote 15 hours agorootparentCopenhagen is as good if not better than both, at least accounting for the population being double that of Zurich. Metro and commuter trains run all day and all night (the trains also go to Malmø in Sweden). Long distance trains go all the way across Denmark and as far as Gothenburg in Sweden, although there are very few been midnight at 4am. reply bobthepanda 17 hours agorootparentprevHaneda is bigger, but not big enough to take on Narita’s 2019 42 million additional pax. Most large cities have more than one airport anyways. London has like six, New York has three, Beijing has two, etc. reply thrawa8387336 17 hours agorootparentprevI had to laugh out. The Japanese do not like the American tourists? reply bobthepanda 13 hours agorootparentmore like, Narita cost a lot of money to build, and the smart money if allowed to would just flood Haneda with as many flights as possible and leave Narita an empty husk. Putting more restrictions on Haneda allows Narita to not be a totally useless airport. reply proggy 17 hours agorootparentprevEh, I get all that, but Narita is still quite useful as a transfer hub for passengers traveling between North America and East Asia. Haneda’s gate capacity is also a limiting factor, Narita is a necessary companion airport to soak up excess passenger demand. reply benjymo 18 hours agoparentprevIt also should be connected to the national rail network so long distance trains go there directly. It greatly reduces time to switch trains when you're not directly from the nearest city. Vienna did this with their airport. reply sofixa 14 hours agorootparentYep, Paris CDG has a small version of this (high speed trains only, but this allows for connections between planes and rail to be made) which is getting expanded with a link to the regional network of the region right to the north of the airport. reply bluGill 17 hours agorootparentprevOnly if the airport is onithe way.

There is a via rail track and stopIt's the main counterexample to 'The Olympics are good because they force the development of infrastructure that otherwise wouldn't get built' argument. > Many of the weird choices about that airport was made so it would be open and useful for the 1976 Olympics. The location was closer to Montreal (but father from Ottawa) in part to make the international arrival experience better for the fans (not for the long-term users of the airport). The plan was 'International flights in time for the Olympics and Domestic flights a couple of years later' as a way to 'show off to the world.' That's just poor and short sighted planning, nothing specific for the Olympics. Paris for instance isn't making any such short term infrastructure decisions, only rushing to finish some stuff before the Olympics (e.g. line 14 to Orly, while failing others like line 15 South which was supposed to be ready but won't). reply bluGill 17 hours agorootparentIt is a common enough thing with the olympics to consider it specific to the olympics even though it hapbens elsewhere. reply thaumasiotes 18 hours agorootparentprevI thought the main counterexample to that argument was the fact that it has never worked anywhere. From what I've heard, the Olympics have failed to benefit every city that's hosted them except LA, and the reason they were good for LA was specifically that no new infrastructure was built to accommodate them. reply mdtusz 18 hours agorootparentMany will disagree with me, but the Vancouver Olympics prompted construction of some things that I would consider vital to the Sea to Sky region - the highway upgrade being the biggest. reply rqtwteye 18 hours agorootparentprevI think Munich did well in 1972.

(Although of course this is complicated to assess and contested). Same reason, all infrastructure was either already there or usable after (the Olympic stadium was sold to a football team).

It was a pretty common urban planning concept for a large city to have one airport devoted mostly or entirely to domestic flights, and one mostly or entirely for international flights. New York domestic: EWR New York international: JFK New York freight: LGA Chicago domestic: MDW Chicago international: ORD Houston domestic: HOU Houston international: IAH Dallas domestic: LUV Dallas international: DFW Paris international: CGD Paris international: ORY Washington domestic: DCA Washington international: IAD Notice how some airports (IAD, IAH) specifically have \"International Airport\" in their codes. It worked fine for a very long time until the airlines optimized into the hub-and-spoke system we have today, where connecting flights has become normalized. Because people think now it's normal to have connecting flights all the time, the domestic airports have added international flights, and vice-versa. What was once orderly and predictable has become very messy, and had a number of other side-effects. reply chrisdhal 15 hours agorootparent> Notice how some airports (IAD, IAH) specifically have \"International Airport\" in their codes.

Which, like urban highways, really doesn't make a sense in most cases if one spends a few minutes thinking about it. And especially doesn't make sense for an airport whose main traffic is connecting international and domestic flights. Urban planners in many places in the 1950-1990 time were... special. Blindly copying bullshit that didn't make sense originally and definitely didn't make sense in their city. reply vel0city 18 hours agorootparentprevLUV is an airport in Indonesia, Dallas Love Field is DAL. DAL was forced to be a domestic-only airport from the Wright amendment as DFW was way the hell out in the middle of nowhere in '79, nobody would have bothered going out there if they weren't forced to by federal law. American Airlines wanted an airport, and the federal government gave it to them. And sure, IAH is the bigger international airport in Houston, but it also carries an absolutely massive amount of domestic travel as well. My comment was about having an airport be almost exclusively international travel with few domestic connections. reply masklinn 14 hours agorootparent> DAL was forced to be a domestic-only airport from the Wright amendment as DFW was way the hell out in the middle of nowhere in '79, nobody would have bothered going out there if they weren't forced to by federal law. American Airlines wanted an airport, and the federal government gave it to them. That's more than a little revisionist: following the CAB's demand for a joint international-class airport (Dallas refused to use GSW, and DAL had gotten way too small for the traffic, and its runways too small for international jets), Dallas, Fort Worth, and the existing airlines signed an agreement to phase out cross-state operations at local airports and move them all to DFW. When DFW opened, all the airlines moved their non-local operations there per the agreement. Except Southwest, who'd been created after the agreement, decided they were not bound by it, and enjoyed a now empty and easily accessible airport. And since Southwest's operations were initially intrastate, they didn't fall under CAB jurisdiction, which was the reason for DFW existing in the first place. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 then meant Southwest was able to expand to interstate traffic without being restrictible by a dying CAB. Wright was passed to protect an airport which CAB had all but forced on the area (though to be fair CAB was paying for airports, which was why they wanted them regrouped). Plus bankrupting DFW would have completely broken DAL and aviation to the region. reply vel0city 14 hours agorootparentThanks for informing me to the history of the CAB decisions. In the end though, it still seems like American and Braniff weren't happy people were sticking it out with Love instead of their larger and fancier airport, and deregulation gave people the market to choose which airport they really wanted to go to until the Wright amendment forced people again. Even knowing this additional history of it being a joint decision pre-deregulation, I'd still argue my earlier viewpoint still has a good bit of truth to it. American Airlines (and a few others) wanted people to use the new airport instead of the airport the people wanted and got Congress to force people to go to DFW. GSW failed because people didn't really want it. DFW would have failed post deregulation as well if the federal government didn't force it to succeed. FWIW I do agree this was ultimately a good thing in the end though. It would not have been good for DFW airport to fail, and the region definitely did need a larger airport. It seems like we do agree with this line though: > nobody would have bothered going out there if they weren't forced to by federal law. reply sumtechguy 18 hours agorootparentprevI too thought 'international' in the name meant something. Until I worked with a guy who was into gliders. They named the large empty grass field that you had to drive for an hour to get to an 'international' airport. It was basically just enough to get a very small airplane aloft with a glider attached. They thought it was funny they pulled it off. reply reaperducer 18 hours agorootparent\"International\" in the name of an airport signifies that it is certified to receive international flights. I'm pointing out the use of \"International\" in airport codes, not names. reply bluGill 17 hours agorootparentprevInternational means customs is there when you land your plane. Tiny airports near borders tend to be international while larger ones far away are not as nobody flies the from elsewhere anyway. some airports you need to make an appointment or customes will not be there. reply sofixa 18 hours agorootparentprev> Just to confirm, the new airport served pretty much only international flights Yes, they decided they'll try to do it like Paris with CDG and Orly, but fundamentally misunderstood the differences the traffic - Orly mostly serves tourist destinations or places where lots of people living and working in France have origins in such as Portugal and the Maghreb from where there will be limited amounts of changes to international flights; and Air France is abandoning Orly and focusing entirely on CDG because even the small opportunity misses aren't worth the extra costs. And both are well connected to the city they're serving, including to each other with the RER B (okay it takes 1h30m, but at least it's a mostly direct connection). And CDG even has high speed rail to other cities. Montreal isn't even close in terms of traffic patterns... and even if it was, the connectivity to Montreal (and ideally Ottawa) really wasn't there. reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentprev\"exceptionally poor planning\" is common in big projects like this. As soon as the design/planning teams gets big enough that there are many people who barely know eachother, they start competing to the detriment of the whole... Nobody wants their part late/over budget, so they do things to screw other parts of the project just so their part isn't late or over budget. reply bombcar 18 hours agorootparentYou also have large groups of various entities brawling over it, and you end up with compromises - where compromise means nobody is happy about anything. reply bombcar 18 hours agoparentprevExactly - it has to be holistic and actually planned out. If you want to run two airports in the same city, there really should be some form of quick connection between them, or each has to be so big as to be self-sufficient. Moving an airport is even harder than just building one, because the airport often doesn't own all the businesses and land around said airport, and so is negotiation making those less valuable. And at some point, it's stuck - LAX is so enclosed in Los Angeles and LA is so big that you'd be quite far from it to add a new airport. You're more likely to repurpose Ontario or even a military base instead. reply giantrobot 14 hours agorootparent> You're more likely to repurpose Ontario or even a military base instead. Ontario was repurposed, at least expanded greatly in scope. It used to be basically a UPS and FedEx airstrip with very limited passenger flights.

They failed to implement any proper connections to the city itself, which is related to but not due to the distance.

    "originLink": "https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2023/09/04/why-the-2-inflation-target/",
    "originBody": "Why the 2% inflation target? Written by Ethan Messeri Inflation has been in the news a lot lately. Recently, it has always been in the context that inflation is too high. From eggs to rent prices, everything is going up, and whenever someone talks about inflation, lower is always better. However, as many know, the Federal Reserve, the central bank for the United States, has had a de facto target rate of inflation at 2% and an official target rate ever since 2012. So why does the Fed want some level of inflation? Why should the target not be 0%? After all, no one likes it when prices rise, so why not 1%? Why not negative inflation or deflation? Is there a reason for 2%? The story of the 2% inflation target starts oddly in New Zealand. In 1989, New Zealand wanted to codify the independence of its central bank, and in this bill, it directed the New Zealand finance minister and head of its central bank to come up with an inflation target (Irwin 2014). If this target was not met, then the head of the central bank could be fired. According to David Caygill, New Zealand’s finance minister at the time, “Inflation targeting wasn’t from our point of view the main point of the act,” and establishing the bank’s independence from political processes was far more important (Irwin, 2014). There were some concerns that a target would lead to higher employment, but the main opposition to the inflation target was in the hospital at the time. Once the bill became law, then an inflation target had to be chosen. In an off-hand remark in an interview, the former head central banker said the inflation target should be zero to 1 percent. However, Don Brash, the head of the central bank, claimed “It was almost a chance remark,” and “The figure was plucked out of the air to influence the public’s expectations ”(Irwin, 2014). They used this number as a starting point and pushed it up to 2% to give themselves a bit more room. One could easily believe that an arbitrary number based on lack of political opposition and an off-hand comment by a central banker would not have much effect, but that assumption would be wrong. Once the central bank said that inflation would be 2%, everyone else assumed that it would be too, since the central bank could use monetary policy to change the inflation rate. For example, contracts assumed a 2% inflation rate, which means wages would only rise 2% a year. This meant that costs only would have to rise 2%, meaning that inflation slowed. It also got rid of the inflationary cycle where one buys goods now since they now believe they will be much more expensive later, creating a shortage of goods and an increase in prices. In 1989, the inflation rate was 7.6% in New Zealand, and by 1991 it was 2%. Countries started to take notice, and Canada and Britain implemented inflation targets shortly after (Irwin,2014). The United States was having a debate about the inflation rate the Fed should target, at the same time. Paul Volcker, who was Fed chair from 1979 to 1987, and his succeeding Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, who served during this time period and until 2006, favored an inflation rate that was 0% to 1% (Sommer, 2023). They argued that this target was minimal enough to not affect business decisions, and prices would stay stable. However, Fed Governor and later Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, favored a higher inflation target that would allow for the Fed to take greater action if there was a recession (Sommer, 2023). She argued that, if there is a recession and the inflation rate is already very low, then there would be a high risk of deflation. Although the idea of a more valuable dollar may sound great, many economists think it is worse than high inflation (Engeman, 2019). The problem is that the value of money would increase when people do nothing with it. This would be problematic since people would not invest or spend money to get the country out of a recession when they could just get a return from doing nothing. Instead of taking a risk and investing the money, the velocity of money decreases, and there is less spending leading to higher unemployment and less growth. The cycle could then create more deflation and less spending, putting the country into a self-fulfilling recession cycle. During the late 1990s, Japan saw the deflationary fear come true, where a deflationary economy created a decades-long stagnation. Combined with the mild 2001 post 9/11 recession, the argument to have a higher inflation target in the U.S. was strengthened (Irwin,2014). Thus, the implicit 1% target started gradually increasing. One analysis of FOMC meetings found that the Fed preferred an implicit target of 1.5 core inflation from 2000 to 2007 (Shaprio, Wilson, 2019). However, after the 2008 recession, the consensus shifted to a compromise of 2% inflation target in line with New Zealand, which was later made official in 2012 by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, which is still in place today (Shapiro, Wilson, 2019). The above current events show that an inflation target has some power and inflation seems to show that inflation targets have some power. A study by the IMF confirms this and says, “Nonetheless, empirical evidence on the performance of inflation targeting is broadly, though not totally, supportive of the effectiveness of the framework in delivering low inflation, anchoring inflation expectations, and lowering inflation volatility. Moreover, these gains in inflation performance were achieved with no adverse effects on output and interest volatility” (Jahan, 2010). However, is 2% the right number? The first problem is that if the Fed does change its inflation target, it loses a lot of its credibility, which is what the inflation target’s power comes from. This loss of trust is a major problem. For example, if you no longer believe the Fed inflation target, then you will base your actions on what you think the inflation rate will be, which can lead to cycles of inflation. If you believe inflation will be high soon, you will buy a lot of stuff now when prices are lower. However, other people will realize this too, and then there will be a race to buy goods and services, which will lead to less supply and higher prices. This creates more demand, which leads to higher prices, creating the inflationary doom loop. Showing that losing the Fed’s credibility may not be worth the benefit of a better target. The story of the inflation target is one which is much more random and less thought through than you would expect. A politician and central banker which few around the world knew changed world economic history, and created one of the most powerful monetary policy tools. However the world has cemented this target into the core assumptions of the world economy and there would be repercussions all around if we changed the target. Each target has trade offs but perhaps finding an optimal level would lead to a more prosperous world. Bibliography Engamann, K. (2019, January). The fed’s inflation target: Why 2 percent?

(2023) (umich.edu)223 points by luu 15 hours agohidepastfavorite500 comments sob727 13 hours agoYellen supposedly told Greenspan & co in the mid 90s that 2% was a good way for companies to be able to adjust labor costs down if needed (if you don't give someone a raise when inflation is 2%, you're effectively lowering their salary). It was the only way to have some flexibility there. If you admit that this is a desirable thing, this is defeated by wage negotiations (or say, benefits) than tend to be indexed to inflation. Another interesting thing that happened under Greenspan is how inflation is computed (hedonics, replacements, etc... conceptually, think \"if I can't buy a porterhouse steak anymore, I'll get the lesser hanger\", meaning inflation is underreported). I'm not suggesting this was intentional or coordinated, but this had the huge benefit for federal and local governments that it lowered the benefits they had to pay out that were linked to inflation. Issue is it hurts the poor more. reply FactKnower69 11 hours agoparent>2% was a good way for companies to be able to adjust labor costs down if needed (if you don't give someone a raise when inflation is 2%, you're effectively lowering their salary) This is EXACTLY the issue. The economy is rigged such that in the absence of any positive action, workers' purchasing power goes down over time by default. This obviously isn't a problem for the rich, whose money is stored almost entirely in assets which by definition rise in value with inflation. Meanwhile, everyone else whose income comes primarily from a wage must constantly struggle for more concessions just to earn the same real amount they did last year. reply itsoktocry 10 hours agorootparent>The economy is rigged such that in the absence of any positive action, workers' purchasing power goes down over time by default.

But your comment implies that people are getting poorer over time, and it flies in the face of reality, doesn't it?

Society has become significantly wealthier, despite the absurdities of inflation and interest rates. I think you are confusing two entirely different things. You can have a society that's getting wealthier and still people getting poorer. In fact, you have just that in the real world. It's as simple as seeing how the median salary and average salary compare and evolve. It's as simple as comparing how minimum wages evolved with inflation. It's no coincidence that even in the US, humanity's apex in economic development and wealth, the average Joe cannot afford a house while a few decades back it could. reply throwawaymaths 4 hours agorootparentprevPeople are not getting poorer because productivity has been going up to compensate. As in, we're milking more and more out of the labor and middle classes. (Ok also technology papers over the problem as commerce becomes somewhat more efficient) The family is not too much less wealthy but also we have families with two incomes, breadearners working overtime, stressed out family dynamics, and student going into deeper and deeper debt to be credentialed enough to participate in the sophisticated workforce. If you look at the \"wtf happened in 1970\" chart, the y axes are productivity and real wages. It turns out 2% inflation is enough to steal the productive increase of labor and middle classes and transfer it to the politically connected, wealthy, and financial sectors. At some point it's just going to be impossible to wring more gains out of labor and technology improvements. We're probably really close. reply oblio 10 hours agorootparentprevAre you talking about a timescale of 100 years or 30?

As to poor people’s lives in the US, it’s basically flat with wage growth or loss depending on how you calculate inflation over the last 40 years. The median income earners in Q1 1990 made 408$/week, one inflation source puts that at 951.17$/week in Q1 2023, vs 1095$ so is what the actual dividing line was. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881500Q https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ So 0.3% annual growth over that timeframe with many ups and downs so numbers also look different depending on what exact dates are chosen. The line between 1st and 2nd quartile is again basically flat, though the data doesn’t go before 2000. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252916100A Though again there’s many ways of calculating inflation, and many of them show that hypothetical person worse off. And of course individuals aren’t going to stay at exactly the same income band so many many people really are significantly worse off. reply patmcc 10 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn't address the claim oblio was making - 'People are poorer than they were in 1990, especially the mid to lower classes' - real GDP per capita could double but it all be captured by the top quartile, for example.

Real terms is a bit suspect in this case as wage earners are more likely to pay nominal rent then owner equivalent rent. It may well be accurate that the average wage earner is worse off today then they were in 1971. I'd venture a speculation that this is reflected in media, sitcoms of the 70s rarely had roommates - and the 80s/90s poked fun of those who lived in their parents basements.

So while wages increased 15%, the price of everything else around us increased over 700%. reply erko_ 3 hours agorootparentThe 15% increase in wages is in real terms, meaning it's already been adjusted with inflation.

Gasoline was roughly 1/3rd the price, but 4 years of state college was 20k, not 100k. A house I grew up in, while 30 years newer, cost 80k compared to 300k now, even though it needs a lot more work. Minimum wage there went from 4.25 an hour 30 years ago to 7.5. Health care costs have gone up way more than double. So maybe people make twice as much cash, but their costs for the things they actually need, without bullshit fake adjustments, cost 3 to 4 times more than they used to.

I don't think your graph says what you think it says. The graph shows a time series of the rate of homes which are owner-occupied to those that aren't. When the average Joe buys a house, they tend to stick with it for life. However, the graph you linked clearly shows this rate plummeting from 2004 to 2016, with the nosedive amounting to around 6%. This means that in a short span of a decade, the amount of home owners living in their own home dropped 10%. You have a small spike around 2020 which I bet was caused by WFO allowing people to live in places cheap enough that they could finally afford their home, but that stagnated already. Also, it's interesting how such a meteoric drop happens in an indicator that tracks home ownership, which is something people do for life. You need a very radical change in the people's ability to afford a house to see so many people stop affording them in such a quick timespan. reply throwawaymaths 4 hours agorootparentprev> have average people You mean median person.

If economy in general goes up 20x and your own wealth increases 1.5x, yeah you got wealthier compared to before, but poorer compared to everything else. reply dgoldstein0 9 hours agorootparentThis sounds fine to me if \"your own wealth increases 1.5x\" means an increase in purchasing power as opposed to the 1.5x being wiped by inflation. E.g. if housing costs quadruple you can't use that extra cash to buy a nicer house/rent a nicer apartment than before, and probably you want to save the extra money as a result of the higher housing costs rather than buying better food (assuming it didn't also rise significantly in price) We like to hand wave and approximate costs via a single \"inflation\" number but smart phones are infinitely more cheap than 20 years ago - they didn't exist back then - whereas they don't solve basic needs like food & shelter. So we need better metrics. So I have to hand wave a bit but if the economy grows such that everyone has better purchasing power, but the top 5% or 1% benefit 100x more than everyone else, I think that's a win; it'd of course be better if the new wealth was spread closer to equally, but the main thing is to make sure as much as practical that everyone is better off. I'm not actually sure we know what the right economic policies to promote this sort of goal are. reply kbelder 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause there is no absence of any positive action. That's one of the main benefits of the free market. reply roenxi 10 hours agorootparentprev> Society has become significantly wealthier, despite the absurdities of inflation and interest rates. That is the issue with the absurdities of inflation and interest rates - how do you tell whether we're better off if the yardstick for measuring value is being purpose fully distorted? And the way we measure the distortion seems to be unreliable;I don't see how inflation is supposed to rise faster than wages but asset prices seem to be inflating substantially faster than the inflation rate making it harder to save. GDP also disassociated from energy use in the 1970s so I don't see why it going up means I'm better off either - I need cheap energy to be comfortable. All the stuff GDP measures is nice, but rising energy prices are a massive problem that we don't focus on as much as we did when they were driving GDP growth despite the fact that they are still a major part of existing. Asia is better off in real terms. A friend of mine was talking about how he went home to his ancestral village and they had toilets now which is a massive QoL step change. So if \"society\" is global, yes. If we're talking English speaking countries, you can tell me I'm better off, but I'm not sure what metrics you're using or why we believe they matter. I have access to much better electronic equipment than my parents, and our ability to cure ailments has improved markedly. But a bunch of people I know had to leave the city because they literally couldn't afford to live here. Debt seems to be out of control. We're seeing political discontent in the UK and US that seems to be linked to people who don't believe that they are becoming better off, and I tend to believe people when they say that. TLDR; maybe. But you're making a claim that is vaguer than you might think. We're a much smarter society than we were 50 years ago, but it is less obvious who it is that is \"significantly wealthier\" and what that means. reply jrmg 7 hours agorootparentBut a bunch of people I know had to leave the city because they literally couldn't afford to live here. Haven’t people always done that though? America’a history is one of constant migration.

In recent decades, as land across the U.S. filled with development—particularly along the coasts—highly mobile cities became increasingly populated by people born there. As an example, in 1960, 20 percent of U.S.-born residents of Los Angeles were from California, while by 2010, 70 percent were. At the same time, population growth rates have converged and are now similar across all regions. Coate and Mangum theorize that these two trends are connected by home attachment, or “rootedness”—that is, people prefer to live near family and social connections.4 Despite individual differences in the intensity of home attachment, the authors find a preference for home among the young and the old, and for both college- and noncollege-educated workers. reply chii 4 hours agorootparentprev> We're seeing political discontent in the UK and US that seems to be linked to people who don't believe that they are becoming better off I think there's a section of people in this demographic who have been seeing how much better off _others_ are (thru social media etc), and thus feel discontent. This is exacerbated by the fact that such type of discontent inducing content is clickbait and gets people emotional (therefore, engagement). There's some truth, perhaps, to the idea that some people were better off in the seventies than today, but the majority of people are likely living a wealthier life today. They just dont feel it, because there exists an even wealthier class that is now very visible, and it has been ingrained into the youths that modern society has moved past feudalism and classism. reply ajkjk 10 hours agorootparentprevTheir comment is about the math, which has to be true.

If a firm needs to lower costs, the alternatives to mild inflation are: * Negotiating actual salary cuts, or * Job losses Ideally in a market, prices adjust up and down freely. Obviously this is not a sensible approach to salaries. Given the bias towards loss aversion, having mild inflation make mild losses is preferable to having, say: 5% deflation, 7% salary cut. This concept is from Econ 101. And it doesn't mean everyone's wage drops. It means struggling firms can adjust wages less painfully. Your alternatives to 2% are: * active deflation, with actual wage cuts * higher inflation, where you have active salary negotiations each year to predict inflation and negotiate higher or lower than inflation, like in the 70s reply ponow 53 minutes agorootparentWhy should firms get a free 2% cut in salaries paid? Generally, firms are in a stronger negotiating position about salary, especially for the lowest skill labor and poorest people. If there's a downturn, then everyone will have to tighten belts, and firms can make that case to employees. Making a real 2% salary cut the universal default is cruel, and if your typical hourly wage-earner understood clearly the choice being made on their behalf, they'd be pissed. Deals shouldn't be altered without agreement, but that's what 2% inflation targets do. If you agree to a salary, then nobody should be specifically putting their thumb on the scale one way or the the other. Professionals and job-hoppers have less problem negotiating to keep up with inflation. It's the poor people who get screwed. Also, inflation is less steady the farther away from zero it is, I'd wager. So we have inflation spikes sometimes, like we've seen. There's always a time lag between spikes in price increases on goods, and wage increases (which require negotiation). During that lag period before a compensating wage increase, savings get used and real loss is suffered. I highly doubt that the loss in savings is generally recovered, and the Fed never even aims to recover that loss. The most vulnerable people lose the most, and are impeded from building wealth as a result, and probably come to depend on government more. reply dxbydt 10 hours agorootparentprevEcon 101: index to 2% inflation, tolerate mild losses.

The premise of your quip is nonsensical, since people are let go anyways. You wouldn't know that you were the marginal human that was cut because we are in inflation or not. reply oatmeal1 10 hours agorootparentprevYou haven't understood the issue. The issue is involuntary dilution created by fractional reserve banking. When a new loan is created, the bank and (especially) the borrower benefit from the increased money supply. That increased money supply dilutes everyone else. The rich get loans to pay for college, buy houses, expensive cars, and own stock in companies that use leverage to grow faster, whereas the poor get loans to buy mobile homes and cheap cars. Overall, the poor wage earners experience a net dilution compared to the rich. reply ponow 38 minutes agorootparentBut isn't that money multiplier due to fractional-reserve banking essentially a one-shot deal, and doesn't continue to expand over long time periods? So if banks keep 10% in reserves, then a cash deposit gets multiplied by 1/.1 = 10 times, and that factor does not grow with time. Even if there were no law against continually lowering reserve ratios (and therefore increasing this multiplier), the market would tend to create a bound, for otherwise the bank would have greater risk of collapse from runs and unexpected loan defaults. By contrast, if the central bank (Fed) keeps increasing its balance sheet (by buying assets using money it created from thin air), we have continual growth in the money supply (since the folks who sold the assets have new money in their accounts, granted magically by the central bank). In fact, if we had a law that banned fractional-reserve banking for all commercial banks, so that all commercial banks had to have 100% / full reserves, eliminating your dilution, the central bank could still perform open market operations and buy assets with printed money, and thereby continue to increase the money supply. Full reserve for private/commercial banks is still compatible with money printing by a central bank. So I know fractional-reserve gets a lot of heat by sound money folks, but the continual inflation observed since the 70s is not primarily a fractional-reserve problem, but a central bank money printing problem. reply 317070 8 hours agorootparentprev> The economy is rigged such that in the absence of any positive action, workers' purchasing power goes down over time by default. In Belgium, nearly all wages and salaries are \"indexed\" automatically in order to avoid social unrest [0]. If the government notices that prices of an index of goods have increased with 2% or more since the last increase, all wages, benefits and rents go up with the same number. The exact details could fill whole books though. Indeed, if it weren't for such a mechanism, you would need to see strikes way too regularly in order to fix the runaway inflation against fixed wages (which is bad for productivity, which causes even more inflation). It creates a setting where most people (who don't understand inflation anyway) don't need to care about inflation too much either.

All things being equal (and of course they aren’t), inflation is good for debtors and bad for debt-holders. If you owe $500k on your mortgage, inflation at 5% annually is reducing your debt load substantially without you needing to do anything. reply ponow 21 minutes agorootparentExcessive debt is not good. Encouraging debt by the effective subsidy of inflation tends to be coupled with varying interest rates to control that inflation, and therefore there are periods of low interest rates. Savvy investors try to borrow heavily during these low interest periods creating a boom, even though the enterprises they might invest in are no more worthy of investment. This is malinvestment, because real physical capital (including skilled labor) becomes reallocated into more risky ventures because of the influx of easy money. When reality returns and it's clear that many of those risks don't pan out, there is upheaval, bankrupcy, layoffs, etc., a \"bust\". This is a bad thing for economic stability and human happiness. Debt should not be encouraged nor discouraged. Interest rates should be natural, based on market forces about the time value of money. Homeowners don't deserve a mortgage subsidy paid via inflation.

Once you've taken out a fixed-rate mortgage, inflation absolutely has the effect of reducing the value of the debt you owe. It's more if you're about to take out a mortgage that you're rooting against (expectations of) inflation, as lower inflation will also serve to decrease the prevailing interest rate. reply rpcope1 3 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, it wouldn't be surprising to see the US government manipulate inflation in such a way that once the debt load becomes unbearable, it just simply inflates away the debt rather than do austerity or a debt jubilee. reply anonuser123456 8 hours agorootparentprevI hate to break it to you, but the rich are taxed on nominal gains, not real.

This used to make more sense where in the first couple hundred years the end goal of a profession was being the head of your own shop. But it is still true that a lot of people, including all stripes of middle class, are self employed or have income other than wages (I shared a chairlift recently with someone who spent 1/3 of the year ranching his cattle, 1/3 of the year farming a crop with his grandfather and a hired hand, and 1/3 of the year as a ski bum - 3 types of seasonal hard labor that gave him the freedom he wanted) reply simonh 8 hours agorootparentprevYou’re missing the ‘if needed’. The idea is not that wages will permanently lag inflation, we can see from the figures that this has not been the case. Workers know what the inflation rate is and what it means when they negotiate wages. It’s that if there is an economic downturn employers can mitigate some of the impact by freezing wages instead of having to sack employees (or as many, anyway). If needed. This is also not the only reason for targeting inflation at some low but positive level. Another is that you _really_ don’t want persistent deflation, so aiming for modest inflation reduces that risk. Inflation also erodes unproductive savings, encouraging investment, which supports jobs and growth. reply gentleman11 8 hours agorootparentHasn’t it been the case?

The closest thing you will find is OER, but that's unrelated to the stock market or other common assets used by the rich to park wealth. reply iamsanteri 3 hours agorootparentprevYou are viewing inflation narrowly from a worker perspective. Inflation is there to also spur economic activity in a way that encourages people to keep their cash moving and invest their money in a similar way to how companies start losing out if they slow down and rest on their laurels (e.g. stop innovating or growing). In any other case people would just start hoarding their cash. So it’s a way to keep the economy chugging just like purposefully keeping a couple of percent of unemployment always there (even if full total employment would be possible). It tends to keep people on the edge, active and moving. But there are other useful reasons for inflation too. It enables stable expansion of currency and funding of deficits, money printing and overall economic expansion (or funding of wars for political ends) despite all the inconsistencies when allocating this added money supply, and particularly the outright morally bankrupt socialistic rescue of large ”systemically important” banks etc. The same governments that create and manage the money supply may also introduce millions of large deviations and problems with the price formation on goods and services or investment such as IRA sucking the world dry to get all the investment and manufacturing capacity back to the US. It’s a complex topic, but you have to keep in mind that central banks are the mystical force that keeps this whole game running. If you corrupt this system too much it tends to fail and I’d like to remind that the US Fed is the third central bank attempt in the US alone. It’s just crazy how it is all set up this way and people remain fascinated by it. In the end it comes down to trust and military firepower and compulsion (as well as tax collection in that currency, i.e. legal tender) to keep everything legitimate and workable… I could go on and on but you get the point. You are just a cog in the machine, so don’t worry too much if your salary buys you a tad less than before, we gotta work with it somehow and that’s the intention. If you upskill and work hard enough, you can ask for more salary. Or if you’re closer to the source, then you have have nothing to worry about (govt. contracts, even something like large venture capital during the zero interest rate time, or just close and cozy with banks). reply hayst4ck 7 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is much more complex than devalued wages. It's worth asking where the inflated money goes. It doesn't go to your bank account, it doesn't get sent out in checks to every citizen. It goes directly into the pockets of people who take out loans to fund business ventures -- capitalists/owners. That's what the interest rate is, interest on loans. When you have socialism for the rich as we do in America, that further compounds the corruptive damage of inflation, because those loans that are given out are then not defaulted on, so inflation then becomes a direct handout to the rich free from the consequences of risk. This makes both the rich richer and the poor poorer. Inflation fuels wealth inequality, which fuels corruption, which destroys rule of law, which destroys innovation, which shrinks the economy, which requires more inflation. Ray Dailio's Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order talks about why the problem is so much more complex and worse than you think it is (45min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8 reply ponow 10 minutes agorootparentYeah, it angers me to hear people argue that inflation is good because it encourages people to invest instead of hoarding cash. 1. It's your money, so it's not for others to control. 2. You may have a good reason for keeping money under your mattress. For example, you're poor and inexperienced with investing and have heard how people lose their shirts if they don't know what they're doing. There is a lot of complexity to investing, and scary contracts and qualifiers, and then you find out that you don't really own clear title to the stocks you've bought, and hear stories that brokerage firms transfer stock that they don't even have, but will protect favored rich clients if push comes to shove. 3. Maybe there's real risk in the economy, so recklessly investing despite that danger shouldn't be forced one someone with the threat of stealing value. 4. The rich can afford advisors who will help them invest so that they don't have to hold onto inflating cash, and know of ways to preserve value. Only the poor have a sizeable portion of their wealth in cash. reply afpx 9 hours agorootparentprevJust put most of your liquid money in a gold ETF. reply saagarjha 8 hours agorootparentA lot of people don’t have much liquid money they can afford to put in an ETF. reply kypro 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm highly critical of the Federal reverse and I think they suppress wages in other ways, but the 2% inflation target in my opinion has no impact on wages broadly. Assets don't automatically rise in value with inflation. If you own shares in a business generating $100,000 in profit in the current year, then it won't automatically generate $102,000 the next year. In fact, because of inflation it will probably generate less profit because costs are always going up. And if profits are decreasing then so should the value of the company. Hard assets are slightly different, they will generally go up with inflation, but notably the same is true in the reverse. If you're very poor and have a lot of debt, inflation is great because the value of that debt will be devalued. And for these two reasons I'm not sure it's as simple as saying inflation is good for the rich. Inflation is bad for companies with high variable costs. Finally one of the core drivers of inflation is wages. It's very hard for inflation to rise without wages rising, because demand in an economy is ultimately a product of the purchasing power of consumers which is tightly coupled to wages. Without wage growth to get inflation you'd probably need some other driver of demand such as demographics (immigration, high birth rates, etc), fiscal deficits (more public borrowing), or accommodative interest rates (more private borrowing). reply chii 4 hours agorootparent> It's very hard for inflation to rise without wages rising for inflation caused by external factors - such as a war and spiralling high energy prices - it can rise without wages rising. reply username332211 10 hours agorootparentprev> The economy is rigged such that in the absence of any positive action, workers' purchasing power goes down over time by default.

You're contradicting yourself. You can't have \"regulatory capture\" and \"deregulation\" at the same time.

With what results, we see. > They are effectively not enforced Antitrust law enforcement has indeed been irregular since they were passed--but what enforcement has been done has done more harm than good. The classic cases of antitrust enforcement, such as Standard Oil or Alcoa Aluminum, resulted in higher prices and scarcer products for consumers--i.e., a negative impact, not a positive impact. However, antitrust laws are a very small part of the total body of regulations that affect businesses. It's just that most of those regulations are written by executive branch bureaucrats instead of Congress. The Federal Register is much larger than the United States Code, and includes much more detailed micromanagement of all kinds of business activities.

In favor of a little bit of inflation, or a little bit of deflation? Well, inflation is painful, sure, but it's not nearly as bad as deflation. Let's exaggerate the numbers to make this point: if we had 50% deflation, your paycheck--the dollar amount you brought home--would be cut in half.

You'd lose your car, your house, your credit. Cf with 50% inflation. You'd be paying back your debts with inflated dollars, which is hard for banks--but remember, they are also paying back their creditors with inflated dollars too...

Replacing porterhouse with hanger steaks in the basket simply means giving the change in price of hanger steaks a higher weight than the change in price of porterhouse steaks in the basket. It does not mean recording the difference in price between a porterhouse and hanger steak as a decrease in the price index. If porterhouse and hanger steaks both go up by 5% then switching from porterhouse to hanger steaks will not lower inflation, even if hanger steaks are cheaper. And of course that’s the correct way to compute inflation, if people stop using typewriters and start using computers why would you still include typewriters in the consumer basket. It’s not even true in general that the trend has been switching towards lower quality products.

What the general population don't realise is that the value of goods and services are going down over time, due to efficiency increases, at a rate of around 5% / year. The banks can print enough money to soak that up unnoticed, and then an extra 2% just because they can. It's essentially a stealth transfer of wealth from the people to the banks and it's been going on for decades/centuries (before fiat, it used to take the form of coin shaving, impure metals etc). You really see the effect when you look at house prices. They are roughly the same price in gold as they were in the 1970s. Rather than housing going up in value since then, it has been the monetary units going down in value, due to the supply roughly doubling every decade (look up M2 USD). You can understand the incentive to print money when you realise that every year the banks are collecting interest on every dollar/euro/pound etc. in existence. And the banks don't really own any of them - they printed them out of thin air as loans and have to destroy them when the loans are repaid, but total debt only increases every year... reply qwytw 13 hours agoparent> They are roughly the same price in gold as they were in the 1970s So you're implying that there was no inflation between 2011 and 2022 (gold prices were basically the same) or that prices increasing 8 times or so between 2000 and 2011 because gold got a lot more expensive?

It's not at all constant (it's actually more volatile than the dollar) It's pretty rich for you to be using the word \"absurd\" to describe what other people are posting, when you come out with this. Let me translate into actual plain English: the price of gold in dollars has gone up quite a lot between 2000 and 2020. (But note that it still hasn't reached the peak value it reached around 1980, after the huge inflation of the 1970s.) That is not because anything about gold has changed: it has the same industrial and other uses (such as jewelry) as before. The reason the price of gold in dollars has been so volatile is that dollars are volatile--because the government keeps monkeying with them. From 2000 to 2020, the government was printing dollars. In the early 1980s, by contrast, the government was destroying dollars (under Volcker), and the gold price in dollars dropped significantly. Not only that, but this observation isn't limited to gold. It's true of, well, basically everything that isn't money. For instance, houses, as npoc observed. And cars. And food. And clothes. And... The obvious conclusion from observations like this is that what is absurd is using dollars as any kind of measure of value, because the thing they are actually measuring has nothing to do with value to us, producers and consumers, and everything to do with how the government is messing with the money supply. Any commodity that has an actual use independent of government manipulation of the money supply--gold, wheat, whatever--is a better measure of value than money. reply qwytw 11 hours agorootparent> Let me translate into actual plain English Or \"Let me leave out most of the details that matter\".. > quite a lot between 2000 and 2020. > From 2000 to 2020, the government was So specifically between 2001 and 2011 governments have printed several times (~5x) more money than between 2011 and 2022? Because that's obviously not the case. In the first ten year period the price of gold increased fivefold during the second (despite growth in money supply only accelerating) it collapsed and didn't start recovering until 2019 (it's now worth only only slightly more than in 2011..). How does that fit in with the with whole printing hypothesis? > In the early 1980s, by contrast, the government was destroying dollars Just like after 2011? > that dollars are volatile It's not though. Generally the dollar depreciates at a fairly predictable rate. There is a spike here or there but it's nothing compared to the volatility of gold. > houses Yes.

If your claims are true, then inflation was 800% in the 2000s and then 0% in the 2010s. There's clearly market supply/demand driving changes in gold price, not simply exchange rate fluctuation. reply pdonis 10 hours agorootparent> There's clearly market supply/demand driving changes in gold price Of course. And in all other commodity prices. But in a world where the money supply was stable, those price changes, over time, would average out to zero. Or, if you factor in increased productivity over time, they would average out to a steady (if probably slow) decrease in the prices of goods and services. What you would not see is an average increase in the prices of goods and services over time. You would certainly not see such an increase normalized in everyone's expectations, so that everyone expects cost of living increases in their pay, everyone expects things to gradually get more expensive, etc. That requires monetary manipulation by the government. reply chowchowchow 8 hours agorootparentThere’s no natural state of money is there? I feel like characterizing monetary policy that way, as manipulative, is normative and kinda begs the question that there’s a natural state of monetary policy. How could there be growth in the economy with a fixed pie of money? It is contradictory.

If you mean there is no specific quantity of money that is \"natural\", that's true. Any quantity of money can work. But that does not mean that changing the quantity of money as a routine, common operation is a good thing. > How could there be growth in the economy with a fixed pie of money? It is contradictory. No, it isn't. Economic growth means producing more goods and services. With a fixed quantity of money, that means either the velocity of money increases (money goes around in a circle faster in order to facilitate an increased number of transactions) or average prices decrease (so less money is required on average per transaction)--or more likely a combination of both. Both of those things are perfectly possible. (And even that leaves out increasing quality of goods and services, which results in more value created even if quantity stays the same, and with a fixed quantity of money means more value for the same money even if nothing else changes.) > There’d be a tremendously high bar for investment in any enterprise which could generate dollars if I could buy more tomorrow with the dollars I already have today. If the quantity of money is fixed, what does \"enterprise which could generate dollars\" mean? It can only mean a productive enterprise, which produces goods or services that people will pay money for. You want to encourage such enterprises, not discourage them. Indeed, it is only in an environment where the quantity of money is not fixed--where people can scheme to be given the privilege of printing more--that people end up squandering resources on activities which produce no useful goods or services, but do result in more money going into their pockets. Which is the situation we have now, where the government prints money as a way of stealthily transferring wealth to financial institutions without those institutions having to produce useful goods or services. > Think about how much bitcoin is being put to work in the productive economy versus hodled. But that is because the quantity of Bitcoin is not fixed. People can mint more. So Bitcoin is irrelevant to analyzing the case where the quantity of money is fixed. reply qwytw 2 hours agorootparent> Both of those things are perfectly possible Yes, we saw that in the 1800s and the subsequent period leading to the great depression. Money supply was growing too slow, deflation was pretty rampant and the economy was stuck in a permanent boom and bust cycle (with depressions which were generally much worse than anything we experience these days). In such an environment using debt to invest becomes extremely risky.

While this affects a few development details, everything has been done to make the transition as easy as possible. What remains the same All HTML snippets are the same. This means you don't need to update your markup. This is important because it means, if you're using Bulma straight \"out of the box\", you don't need to change anything. You can just swap bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css with bulma@1.0.0/css/bulma.min.css and everything will work. Things will look slightly different, but they will still work. What changes Dart Sass is used to build Bulma if you use the sass npm package, you're already using Dart Sass CSS Variables are used instead of literals: color: var(--bulma-primary); instead of color: hsl(171deg, 100%, 41%);, which means you can customize Bulma with CSS only (without using Sass) Customization by setting your own value for Sass variables works differently. See how to customize Bulma with Sass. What's new (i.e. did not exist before) The notion of Themes is introduced: a theme is a collection of CSS variables within a context, and is the best approach to customize Bulma As a result, a Theme for Dark Mode is included Color Palettes are created for each of the 7 primary colors Skeleton loaders exist as standalone components but also as variants of other components You can add a prefix to all your Bulma classes so that .button becomes .my-prefix-button a pre-built prefixed version exists as one of the alternative versions Assets 3 45 7 103 54 24 2 155 people reacted",

    "commentBody": "The Bulma CSS framework reaches 1.0 (github.com/jgthms)223 points by imjonse 20 hours agohidepastfavorite110 comments toddmorey 17 hours agoI have always loved the helper syntax for this framework: button is-medium is-loading has-text-left That's just so pleasingly readable to me. Bulma is much more css component oriented (contains classes like button and tab) than utility oriented (tailwind-style). But there are a few utility helpers like margin and padding (pt-1, ml-2, etc). I see some folks have never heard of it, but it's been around a while, has about 50k gh stars, and has seen quite a lot of production usage. Definitely a good choice if it fits your needs / style. reply stanislavb 13 hours agoparentOn the topic of GitHub stars - Bulma seems to be the 5th most popular CSS Framework - https://www.libhunt.com/css reply Ringz 16 hours agoparentprevApart from the great CSS framework, I think you could slowly suggest GHS (GitHub Stars) as a new ISO standard. reply toddmorey 16 hours agorootparentYeah I know stars are a fairly worthless vanity metric, but it's the best quick proxy that I know of for community size on this sort of project. I usually check stars and skim open issues. Sometimes a code search to see how many projects and what sort of projects consume the library. reply diggan 16 hours agorootparent> skim open issues What do you go looking for with this? And what results make you consider/not consider the project based on what you find while skimming open issues? reply jawmes8 15 hours agorootparentI usually look for duplicate issues that aren’t being addressed, or if there’s just a lot of seemingly non-trivial ones that go unanswered reply sph 10 hours agorootparentFor me the presence of a stale bot that automatically closes issues after 30 days - like Bulma - is a major red flag. Sweeping issues under the carpet actively makes your library worse, only because one really values the vanity metric of \"closed/open issue ratio\". Github star count is another useless metric, often inflated by \"star this on github\" widgets on the homepage. reply paulddraper 13 hours agorootparentprevSort the issues by # of reactions, and then read the top few. Just like reading Amazon reviews. See what people are complaining about and then answer whether you care about those things reply 0cf8612b2e1e 14 hours agorootparentprevChecking issues can be a little less useful than it used to be.

I could totally see that he'd be able to monetize this like Tailwind, it's a really well thought-out framework with a good compromise between responsiveness, utility classes and components. reply farleykr 17 hours agoprevJust out of curiosity: does anyone know why so many of the sponsors listed on bulma.io are casinos and betting sites? reply johnchristopher 17 hours agoparentProbably it's the same person/web agency casinos go to ? Or all the sponsors are entities from a larger casino/betting group and the inside dev./web agency uses bulma et voilà. reply jeltz 17 hours agorootparentLooking at the links: probably not. These look like shady casinos and casino affiliates. Most likely they do it for cheap high quality backlinks. Several of them promote unregulated casinos targetting the Swedish market. reply voat 17 hours agoparentprevCheap SEO backlinks reply theallan 16 hours agorootparent$100/m is cheap for a back link? (honest question - I've no idea). 67 logos on the home page at the time of writing this, that's $6'700/m. While obviously not FAANG salary scale, it isn't to be sneezed at either. reply kube-system 16 hours agorootparentThere are/were places where you could get really cheap (or free!) backlinks, but most search engines got wise to that trick, and those backlinks (links from spammy sites with little organic traffic) aren't very valuable anymore. To get a link on a reputable standalone website, $100/m seems cheap to me. What better alternatives are there at this quality level? A B2B partnership/sponsorship? You can easily spend 5 digits for that. reply sph 10 hours agorootparentprevThey have a lot of money to launder. Better to spend some of it to reduce exposure, and increase SEO ranking. reply Andrex 16 hours agorootparentprev> $100/m is cheap for a back link? (honest question - I've no idea). Depending on the backlink and ambitions for the website in question, I personally don't see that as unreasonable. reply tempaccount420 6 hours agoparentprevPersonally I'm not political about that but it's unfortunate Bulma chose to hide them now. reply p2hari 18 hours agoprevJust wanted to say thanks for everyone behind Bulma.

I like the minimalistic approach of Bulma. Was able to create a responsive single page app with minimal effort. Themes feature is a welcome addition. reply somishere 11 hours agoprevAlways on the lookout for a quality (low/no js) CSS framework. One that uses sane structural paradigms and doesn't leave a build beholden to 3rd party documentation / questionable design decisions. One that is straightforward to pull back / strip out when the time comes. One with reasonable overheads (branding, download size, etc). And with all that in place - one that handles forms / browser chrome well. Yet to find it, but this looks like it comes pretty close. I'm willing to try it. That said, I had performance issues on the site in Firefox. Very noticeable when switching between dark / light mode.

If you look at the sponsor list you will see a huge portion is gambling related. Does it offer something that that industry finds particularly valuable? reply _fat_santa 18 hours agoparentI think it's more that they provide backlinks. If you're a gambling company this is pretty much the only way you can advertise in the US. reply jeltz 18 hours agorootparentIt is also some illegal casinos which target the Swedish market \"utan spelpaus\" means that it is a casino which ignores the Swedish anti-addiction self block. And \"utan svensk licens\" means that they do not have a Swedish gambling licence. reply diggan 15 hours agorootparentWhich, funnily enough, is expanded on in no less than three[1][2][3] dedicated websites that are essentially called \"Casino-Without-Swedish-License\" in various ways, and are also linked as sponsors on the bulma.io website. [1] - casinoutansvensklicens dot co [2] - utansvensklicens dot casino [3] - casino-utan-svensk-licens dot com reply ulucs 18 hours agoparentprevFunnily enough, the main case is getting cheap reputable backlinks for those companies reply joeyhage 17 hours agoparentprevI did not realize this until now, thanks for pointing it out. I will have to find an alternative because explaining to clients that I use software that openly and prolifically “sells out” to casinos isn’t something I want to spend my time doing reply Uehreka 14 hours agorootparentI was gonna make a jokey comment, but I’m seriously at a loss for words. This is the most overtorqued ridiculous take I’ve read all week. Who cares who else is using the free libraries that you’re using? reply joeyhage 11 hours agorootparentThey are paying sponsors, not consumers. You should read the rest of the comments about these specific gambling organizations and their motives. reply theallan 16 hours agorootparentprevDaft question, but if you hadn't realised, then your client's obviously asked that question yet (and might not)? Open source needs to find a way to make money and backlinks is a reasonable way of doing it. I should say for my own open source project I refuse backlinks to gambling sites on morality grounds though - although looking at how much revenue it might bring in on a monthly basis, there is a lot of temptation there. reply joeyhage 15 hours agorootparentIn my mind, it’s one thing to omit information I don’t know but another to withhold information reply jddj 12 hours agorootparentIt's a bunch of CSS convenience classes, you haven't stumbled upon the panama papers here. reply joeyhage 11 hours agorootparentAgreed, but I’m free to curate the tools I use based on whatever criteria I want. reply mfru 11 hours agorootparentSure, if you have the privilege to make your life unnecessarily harder than it is, then choosing another CSS framework based on whether it has shady sponsors or not is a great pastime. reply conradfr 16 hours agoprevI worked on a project that was using Bulma last week and to be honest, while not bad per se, it just felt like Bootstrap but with a lot less to offer. I'm probably missing something. reply kovezd 16 hours agoparentThat's the appeal: is lightweight. reply conradfr 15 hours agorootparentI guess that makes sense. reply diggan 15 hours agoparentprev> it just felt like Bootstrap but with a lot less to offer. Make sense, Bulma is a CSS-only framework while Bootstrap (last time I used it) also has JavaScript parts to it, so naturally it'd have less to offer. reply partiallypro 14 hours agoparentprevBootstrap is too heavy even when you customize what you're getting, I wish that Foundation would get an update that strips its jQuery dependency, but that project seems mostly dead though I prefer it. reply stevenicr 12 hours agoprevRemade an old site using bulma around 2020 (https://globaladvancedmedia.com/ ) - it had been a wysiwyg publish via old netobjects fusion, with wordpress for a couple of sections. Really enjoyed how easy it was to understand and build with. Around that time I also enjoyed skeleton and a couple others. There were several I tried that just did not sink in for me, one by yahoo I think and then I tried tailwind a couple of times. In my quest for quick, super lightweight / fast load / no bloat builds.. bulma would be my go-to if I needed to use a framework for speed with quick to publish.. lately I have also been just building some with straight grid and css line by line, mainly for the practice and in the quest of using the absolute lightest / fastest to load / core web vitals kind of quest. reply creativeCak3 12 hours agoprevI love the simplicity of Bulma! For someone that does not want to dig into the mess that css can be, it simplifies a lot. I built my personal site with it (https://thebigg.dev/). Congrats on reaching a 1.0! reply ryanbigg 9 hours agoparentYour personal site is so minimal, that it doesn’t even load on my phone. Is the URL right? (Also, that would be a good domain name for myself ;) reply creativeCak3 9 hours agorootparentYes, the url (https://thebigg.dev/) is correct. I just tested on my phone and it's loading just fine--I have an Android phone and test it on Firefox and Chrome and works just fine. Interesting that it does not load for you...what phone/browser are you testing it on? Also, sorry! Already bought the domain a while back ;) reply alentred 12 hours agoprevJust early this week I spent some time (in fact, a bit too much time) on the \"State of CSS 2023\" [0], choosing the CSS framework for \"my next hobby project\". The usual thing: I don't know CSS well enough, but got bored by Bootstrap, and am still scared of Tailwind... Long story short, I was hesitant about Bulma because I feared it will eventually succumb to the same fate the Materialize CSS did. But the framework looked so elegant and easy, I have decided to go with it. Was very happy with my decision so far. I am now double happy seeing it well maintained and it having a fresh update. Thank you for this framework! [0] https://2023.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-frameworks/ reply actionfromafar 18 hours agoprevI have done very very little frontend, and I get confused easily by all the newfangled cool stuff, but a few years ago I had to do \"Frontend in Anger\". Bulma worked for me, I could create a web site with forms and not exactly pretty design, but not a complete eye-sore and it worked both on mobile and on desktop. Just a page-reload web site with separate pages and a Python backend with some kind of python library where you write HTML in Python syntax. reply rendaw 10 hours agoprevThis issue has been open for over four years now, I'm surprised more people aren't hitting this despite being a mobile-first css framework: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2769 It says v1 is a full rewrite though... what does that mean? I would expect v0 to be a rewrite and v1 to be when that stabilizes. Could this have been silently fixed? reply whatamidoingyo 20 hours agoprevI've been using Bulma for years and was surprised there wasn't a 1.0 yet. It is by far my favorite CSS framework. reply ksylvest 17 hours agoprevBulma is an awesome CSS framework! If anyone is interested I worked on a wrapper React component library for Bulma called Tights: https://github.com/ksylvest/tights reply lacoolj 17 hours agoprevYES I love Bulma CSS I am so glad to see this. Thank you contributor(s)! reply imjonse 20 hours agoprevIt is a full rewrite in Sass, with CSS variables, themes and colors being the main novelty. reply chrisweekly 18 hours agoparentIMHO Sass is becoming something of a liability, as its APIs can conflict w/ increasingly capable pure CSS. reply CSSer 17 hours agorootparentI also refuse to touch node-sass (Bulma wisely opted for the Dart implementation, so this is a bit of a tangent). Node itself partially shares the blame for the binding situation, and it's improving with Node ABI. Regardless, it's just too complex a dependency when, as you pointed out, pure CSS is increasingly very capable. It's encouraging to see Tailwind recognizing this and embracing it more thoroughly in their 4.0 alpha. reply nicoburns 12 hours agorootparentIf you want something faster than dart-sass, then https://github.com/connorskees/grass (a rust implementation) is pretty good these days (although it doesn't quite have full compatibility yet). reply c-hendricks 16 hours agorootparentprevnode-sass has been deprecated for about 4 years now: https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated/ reply err4nt 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's also possible to define custom author-defined features fully within standard CSS syntax, which can then be safely picked up and processed by tools (server side or client-side) and handled without needing a custom language and its own custom syntax. It's a solution that's far, far bigger than the problem it solves. reply cantSpellSober 18 hours agorootparentEh they have some really well-done Sass functions, finding \"enough contrast\" for example: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/main/sass/utilities/fun... The closest to that in CSS is color-contrast() which isn't in any browser yet. There's a lot CSS still can't do. reply moritzwarhier 17 hours agorootparentI think the comment you are responding to is thinking about native ways to extend CSS without violating or extending the syntax rules. For example, @-rules. The actual interpolation/processing would still be outside of the browser. IIRC, the normative framework for this is pretty new, and I don't now the rules about function names. The pain with SASS et al is real though. Most frequent offenders in my experience: - the max() function - the division symbol occuring in values of native properties such as grid-column or aspect-ratio Both have been deprecated in newer versions, but it is impossible to automatically fix this unless you know that all of your (S)CSS was written before these features were introduced. reply cantSpellSober 18 hours agorootparentprev...and now they have Sass functions to handle reading/writing CSS vars: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/main/sass/utilities/css... Putting that effort into a JS version of the library might be better reply ademup 12 hours agoprevBulma.io layout is broken in landscape mode on my phone (responsively and full page refresh) with several sections going beyond the edge of the page. Firefix on Pixel 7. I'd love to use this because it looks good, but this makes me lose trust. reply Alifatisk 14 hours agoprevI remember using Bulma years ago, and they just hit 1.0? What’s the reason it took so long? reply philipov 18 hours agoprevIs this named after the Dragonball character? reply vidalee 18 hours agoparentYes! As you can see by the primary color of the framework :) reply faitswulff 17 hours agorootparentRIP Akira Toriyama. I wonder if the 1.0 announcement was related to his passing. reply pull_my_finger 14 hours agorootparentWell apparently, among other things, it includes a complete rewrite to use Dart Sass, so I doubt they did all that to honor Toriyama, when the only link is the name being a random reference to one of his secondary characters. reply LaundroMat 18 hours agoparentprevThe older site used to have a reference to Dragonball, so yes. reply dev1ycan 17 hours agoparentprevhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUXe8vqdvx4 :^) reply block_dagger 6 hours agoprevBeen using Bulma since 2018 on every new project. Love it. reply geenat 17 hours agoprevShould have dumped the build step. reply codingclaws 12 hours agoprevDoes CSS really need frameworks? reply holoduke 11 hours agoprevCan you use this without compiling? I just want to press f5 in my browser. No command line. reply onli 13 hours agoprevI use bulma for a small site of mine: https://www.sustaphones.com/. Some impressions from my usage, after having just updated to 1.0: 1. It's absolutely awesome that 1.0 did not break compatibility with the old HTML. That's quality. 2. Bulma 1.0 finally has a grid component. Very nice, as my site is basically one big grid, and the flexbox solution from before was missing equal height boxes. Though the grid performance seems aweful on my old test phone, but that might not be bulma's fault? 3. I refuse to use build pipelines in my free time for web projects, and with that limitation I never felt in control of bulma. It was default colors or nothing (or custom CSS, which as an artificial limitation I tried to limit to a minimum here). Now, there is CSS variables support and that might be perfect for me - but the docs do not cover how to use that, and whether it's built in a way that they can be used. Can I for example set a custom primary color? The docs show changing the link color to some numeric value, that does not translate for me. That's a bit disappointing after reading about themes and color palettes in the changelog. 4. Even with my very limited usage of bulma's colors, the new dark mode did not work for me. My site has a \"has-background-light\" class at the body, because otherwise bulma's boxes have an unbearably low contrast at their borders/shadows with the background, especially at their top. But \"has-background-light\" stays a light background even in dark mode. That sounds reasonable and like a mistake on my side, until the docs don't present a \"has-background-light-dark\" or something like this, something that changes from light to dark dynamically. 5. Regardless of that, I wouldn't use the default dark mode, it's too dark (and my site embeds images with white background, which I can't change - would have to use a filter maybe). 6. The form helpers, specifically the dropdowns, still feel nice. Though I had to include some hacks to get them to work on mobile and desktop. 7. The color definitions used break the browser dev tools contrast check tool, the colors aren't resolved. This is especially problematic as not all default colors are accessible, the yellow warning color for example has too low a contrast for a white background, with which it's presented in the docs. A framework like this really should only have accessible default colors. 8. The framework does not feel completely thought out with regards to responsiveness. Specifically, often you want to have your outer element only have some margin until the viewport gets very small. But the mx-* margin helper has no variant with included breakpoint, the layout's container `is-fluid` modifier sets a fixed 32px margin, way too much on small screens. reply kthartic 17 hours agoprevBut what is Bulma? I read the github readme and I still don't know what it does (other than it's a CSS framework). The only link that looks useful is the documentation link which leads to a 404 page. I just wanna see an overview or some examples, I'm confused how this isn't the first thing shown on the github page. reply globalise83 17 hours agoparenthttps://bulma.io/ reply kthartic 17 hours agorootparentGreat, but this should be super clear in the readme.

Outside of the tech world no native English speaker would have any idea what a11y was supposed to represent either. We do love shortening words but usually in a more natural way. reply mst 16 hours agorootparentprevI suspect it's basically \"wanted shorter terms for things that couldn't be turned into an acronym\" because ... well, because we're lazy and like typing less. Though i18n for internationalisation has been around for so long now that when I see something like a11y or k8s or etc. I assume it's Another One Of Those and go find out what the long version is. You do need a font where 1 versus l is obvious, but that's also true of reading code so most of us probably -do- have such a font already.

Countless efforts have been made to develop robots that look and behave like real pets, human's best friends. Yet quadruped robotic systems have been very complex and take a big upfront capital and lots of expertise to start. It was too difficult for individuals to get a dynamic walking robot in their hands. Solution OpenCat as the Solution Goal: to easily build and develop quadruped robot kits by greatly lowering the cost and technical barriers Solutions: use hobbyist high-performance servos as the joints arrange servos in an optimized body frame use low-cost popular hardware as the controller (Arduino, ESP32 or Raspberry Pi, etc.) to support add-on modules such as smart camera module, IoT sensors, and voice command modules efficient and open source control codes for vivid motion tasks Button OpenCat Stats 0 OpenCat-based Commercial Robot Pets Shipped 0 Countries of Users 0 DIY Robot Pets from Our Users 0 Github Stars commercial robots Commercial Robots Powered by OpenCat OpenCat has been deployed on Petoi's mass-produced palm-sized, realistic lifelike robot cat Nybble and robot dog Bittle that can run, walk, and self-balance like a real animal. We've successfully crowdfunded these two open source robot building kits and brought them to thousands of users from 60+ countries. DIY Robots Based on OpenCat Many DIY versions of OpenCat-based quadruped robots have been developed in the worldwide community. Dream of building your own robot pets? Why Do We Share via Open Source? to foster collaboration in the robotic motion, IoT(Internet of Things), and AI development of affordable quadruped robots with more users and developers to bring STEM & robotics educational resources and curricular to the mass and inspire engineering and computer science students, adults, teens, and kids of all ages to join the robotic AI and IoT revolution to modulate the functionalities of a complex system history How OpenCat Started People have been amazed by the versatility of Boston Dynamics Dogs since their viral demo in 2015. In 2016, Petoi's founder & CEO Rongzhong Li started the OpenCat project with robotic pet prototypes in his dorm room. After one year of R&D, he founded Petoi LLC and devoted all his resources to build and manufactured smart bionic four-legged open source robot building kits.",

The Petoi site boasts about how many stars they have on Github, but don't actually link to it. reply clhodapp 11 hours agoprevPetoi had a rep at OpenSauce in San Francisco. I picked up a Nybble, because I like the look of Nybble better than Bittle. It's a fun little toy and I really appreciate what Petoi are doing with the robots & the OpenCat framework! However... due to either a design flaw or my own subtle mistake in assembling it (haven't identified which yet), the poor cat's tail is too long! It hits the floor and topples the bot over! reply nine_k 8 hours agoparentMod yours into a bobcat or a lynx! reply tamimio 12 hours agoprevDespite their cool look and visually appealing design, QUGVs are still not optimal for practical real-world applications. Their limited mobility in comparison to UAVs for ISR operations, coupled with a mediocre payload capacity relative to traditional UGVs, results in a platform that have disadvantages from both categories. In my opinion, QUGVs are primarily beneficial for educational purposes or just a show or a ‘wow’ reaction from those outside the robotics field. For example, Boston Dynamics cannot descend stairs in reverse last time I checked, while Unitree tend to overheat rapidly, with internal components that are susceptible to failure, and they are constructed with cheap components, such as three Jetson Nanos, rather than a single, more robust SBC, etc. reply tweetle_beetle 11 hours agoparentYou're not wrong, but probably applying a critique which is irrelevant to the product under discussion. I don't think potential owners of 'robotic pets' will be making purchases based on maximising payload capacity, or practical real-world applications. reply tamimio 11 hours agorootparentYou are not wrong either, hence why I said > QUGVs are primarily beneficial for educational purposes… But it still beneficial to give a heads up for anyone before investing efforts and time that QUGVs are simply for these purposes, which is something you can see in some comments in here, personally, I would invest those efforts in drones but YMMV. reply idiotsecant 9 hours agorootparentWhat efforts are you saying are poorly invested?

Combined with UAV capabilities, it could be a very capable mapping or ISR tool in places like caves, or following earthquakes. The ‘hopping’ type in particular might be particularly valuable for lunar and asteroid mapping. reply mkoubaa 11 hours agoparentprevHumans bred cats for thousands of years for utility that had nothing to do with \"payload capacity\" reply rafaelmn 10 hours agorootparentYou think these robots are good for pest control ? reply nadermx 10 hours agorootparentCould be with a proper addon reply idiotsecant 9 hours agorootparentprevI think I saw that black mirror episode. reply tacocataco 6 hours agorootparentprevYes... if we breed robot cats for thousands of years. reply l33tman 10 hours agorootparentprevI would buy THAT for a dollar! reply mschuster91 9 hours agoparentprev> Their limited mobility in comparison to UAVs for ISR operations UAVs are highly susceptible to wind and drift, especially indoors with no GPS, and while DJIs collision avoidance is pretty good, any land based vehicle won't (fatally) crash if it touches anything. reply jpt4 9 hours agorootparent\"Hopping drones\", with movement akin to the hunting method of robins [0], will be used as a kind of living minefield in military operations. When anti-air is absent/suppressed, they will engage in high energy aerial maneuvers to cover as much ground, with as little contest, as possible. Once emplaced, they will lower their signature and engage in low energy defensive fire/ambush behaviors, to hold territory. The critical consideration is that movement is dangerous, under conditions of pervasive battlefield surveillance, so when it is possible at all it must be exploited to its full potential, and thus can be conducted via an expensive process such as flight. In turn, to make movement dangerous to the enemy, one must make terrain frictionful to cross, through high lethality, low detectability assets, of which mines are the paradigmatic example. [0] Brief bursts of flight interwoven between slow stalking of different ground locations for worms. reply eszed 8 hours agorootparentI hadn't thought of that, but it's terrifying. Like, far more nightmare-inducing than a conventional minefield. How would you counter? Up-armoured bipedal robots with roughly human-shaped heat-signatures is the only thing that would defeat easily-implemented automatic counter-measures. But if the \"minefield\" is under surveillance + command and control, then that goes right out the window. Besides, the cost-benefit (let alone logistics) is firmly in favor of the defender's \"robins\". I suspect attackers will try jamming signals and then send in the meatshields. Ugh. reply nine_k 8 hours agorootparentWhy, a \"vacuum bomb\", that is, a large-volume detonation of combustible spray, could give a serious kick to anything and everything within the area. (If not that, a small nuke can generate enough heat and gamma rays to burn everything near the point of the blast, but the military escalation hasn't reached this point just yet.) reply tamimio 6 hours agorootparentprevThat’s because you are not following the industry; denied-GNSS navigation has been a thing for a while. I have also seen several drone designs that can attach themselves to the silo steel wall from the inside for inspection jobs. UAVs aren’t perfect; their biggest drawback is the battery endurance before jumping to an airplane scale, but they are effective, efficient, and reliable for all their applications, even more than UGVs (UGVs have been used in real-life applications since the 90s or even before, yet drones took over in the last decade). QUGVs, on the other hand, are merely a toy, for education, or marketing purposes. The only purpose I can see for QUGVs, or even UGVs in the future, is interoperability with drones, but definitely, drones are and will be the dominant force in the field for the future. reply persnickety 2 hours agoparentprevQUGV?

In https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat-Old/issues/7, the creator admits that the \"nyboard\" (https://docs.petoi.com/nyboard/overview) at the heart of their robots is derived from Arduino, but insists that they don't need to comply with the licensing terms for derivative boards (https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415094490770-L...) because Arduino is unlikely to sue them. reply NavinF 10 hours agoparentIt's unfortunate that the hardware isn't open source, but I think he's technically right that his board is not an Arduino derivative from a legal perspective. \"I initially built the prototype with an Arduino board.

The amount of information available, even filtering for the best of the best by whatever heuristic I can choose, is vastly larger than my ability to process as a single person. If anything, I've found that the faster I reject due to dark patterns, the better off and more informed I am. If something is truly worth learning about, it will bubble up again elsewhere soon enough. reply serf 6 hours agorootparentprevI feel, personally, that 'signs of quality' are one of the best metrics an individual can have for making a decision to spend time on something. Making a judgement on what to spend time on is literally the thing that allows for it to happen. Otherwise my time would be spent on shit. reply barfbagginus 10 hours agorootparentprevDo you feel that a focus on dismissing and defending dark patterns is appropriate or constructive? What world are you helping construct, and what values are you supporting? Are you aiming for a world where open hardware becomes dominant and beneficial? I feel the point was a valid red flag. This org may be more interested in marketing itself than it is in supporting open source. Looking at their repos, we find that the designs for their robots are not public. This company is using the open core / artificial scarcity model for their hardware, while presenting themselves as a fully open source organization. This is an organization exploiting open source for its marketing, without supporting open hardware. This is important: Contributors looking for a real open hardware project to work on should consider looking elsewhere. If they contribute to this project, they would be contributing to a partially proprietary ecosystem. This tends to compromise the promise of Open hardware, which includes low cost replication and iteration on hardware designs. Tldr: when an open source organization practices dark patterns, people need to hear about it. It's not a minute fact- it's a major compromise of Open source values and outcomes. reply exe34 12 hours agorootparentprevI instinctively closed the popup, so I have no idea what I just agreed to... reply isuckatcoding 11 hours agoprevReal pets looking nervously around… In seriousness this is really cool!

Quit calling them cats and dogs.

But those shouldn't be that expensive, really. Anti-suffering advocates caused the process of slaughter for general farmed meat animals to get researched a lot, so that now we know fairly well how to kill a tame animal without causing suffering. IIRC the one requiring the least skill and least likely to accidentally cause great suffering is the \"inert gas asphyxiation\", i.e., displacing the air in the poorly ventilated space the animal is in with commonly nitrogen, until the Oxygen concentration drops so low the brain just passes out. We know from many pilots who fucked up how humans experience oxygen deprivation to the extend that your copilot already passed out. The become loopy, incoherent, but notably not with memories of when asked during it that they feel bad/suffering. And well, even when liquid the nitrogen sufficient to flood an their normal room would only cost like 1~5$. And it carries reasonably in basically just 5~10l versions of those fact insulated tea/coffee bottles for being on the go and having hot tea when making a stop after say 5 hours. So yeah, essentially, it shouldn't cost more than 200~300$ during the entire lifetime to have appropriate medical supervision for a normal cat. More than that is due to either greedy vets or cat owners who spend a lot on fancy healthcare to get a few extra years of lifespan for their cat. But from a pure financial POV, most of that isn't worth it: generic cats are very not hard to breed/multiply. reply fragmede 11 hours agorootparentprevwhich, That medical help can get expensive.

    "originBody": "magick.css by winterveil Github Discord Donate In the grand compendium of universal knowledge, it is universally acknowledged that the scribbles of a wizard not only transcend the mundane but are, without a shadow of a doubt, the most exhilarating form of notation known to humanoid kind. For who could resist the allure of a well-placed spell in the margins? Albus Greybeard, On the Virtues of Mystical Marginalia, 1132 Fundamentals magick.css is a minimalistic, (mostly) classless CSS framework that is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. It is contained in a single file, and every choice is commented. The goal is to achieve an elegant, but magically playful look, while maximizing readability and the ability to convey information; somewhat akin to the notes of a wizard. The framework retains its beauty and functionality across all devices and screen sizes, and works entirely without JavaScript. It is inspired by LaTeX, old school TTRPG rulebooks, CSS frameworks like concrete.css and Tufte CSS and the \"usability as design\" ethic of brutalism. How to use magick.css magick.css works best with normalize.css, using it is strongly recommended! The easiest way to check out magick.css for your own project is to add it from a CDN. Just add these two lines to your html : You could also just download the magick.css file from this repo, and include it into your htmlas you normally would:You could also add magick.css to your JS project like this: npm install normalize.css magick.css And import them in your code: import 'normalize.css' import 'magick.css' For anything beyond that: magick.css should work with any HTML5 document, as it is 99% classless. There are some cool features that you can use, though; just scroll down to discover them! Layout To have your page structured as a responsive, readable column, wrap all of your content intags, and then usetags to break up long form content content into sections. This page is a good example of how to do this. (You could of course just ignore this advice and use magick.css for typography and styled components only.) Here is a simple example of the usual structure: To add tangential information, magick.css uses thetag. You will find it used from time to time on this page. Should you want to elaborate on a point, or provide additional context, you can use magick.css's sidenotes. Sidenotes are automagically numbered! You can find out more about this in the Extras section below. Typography Here is a showcase of the typography that magick.css offers: Heading 1: A title bold and grand, the story's gate. Heading 2: A subtitle beneath, where chapters await. Heading 3: With secrets whispered, plots thicken here. Heading 4: Fine details shared, the message stands clear. Paragraphs flow, a river of text, Links like portals, where will we go next? Strong as stone, our words firmly stand, Emphasized whispers, softly they land. Underlined secrets, subtly hinted, Small, yet mighty, our words are minted. Code speaks in logic, crisp and neat, Typography's spell, now complete. Headings beloware not styled by magick.css; they are usually not needed for hierarchical structuring, but instead for very specific use cases. So should you need them, you can style them as you see fit. [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures [...] write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. Edward Tufte, foum post, ‘Book design: advice and examples’ thread Structured Content Lists Lists are kept simple, as to not distract from the content: This is... ... an unordered list. This is... ... an ordered list. And this weird fellow here... ... is a description list. Tables In a similar manner to lists, tables are clear and concise, directing reader focus to the data at hand: Potion Main Ingredient Catalyst Glow Dew Bioluminescent algae (81mg) 🜼 Float Leaf Dandelion puff (61mg) 🝆 Might Brew Ginseng root (78mg) 🝀 Vanish Draft Mimosa pudica (26mg) 🜞 Remembrance Tea Ginkgo biloba (39mg) 🜇 Forms & Input Interactive elements can be used on their own, or as part of a form. Keep reading to see examples of both. Buttons I am a button. I am disabled. Text Inputs Free standing text inputs are not opinionated in regards to their size or placement, as their use can vary greatly. Here are some examples: Checkboxes & Radio Buttons Labels for checkboxes and radio buttons are expected after the input element. This way, magick.css can ensure proper grouped spacing between them, without requiring additional wrappers and classes. I am a checkbox. I am disabled. I am a radio button. I am disabled. Fieldset I am some option. I am another option. Forms Forms provide a structured context for interactive elements. In magick.css, forms are styled to stand out, grabbing the user's attention. To stay within the established design, this is achieved by giving forms a handwritten, paper note feel: Name: Practiced Schools: Message: Radio Buttons Radio 1 Radio 2 Checkboxes Checkbox 1 Checkbox 2 Submit Reset Media & Figures Media elements such as images and video can stand alone or be presented as a figure, giving structure and elegance to your content, and an opportunity to add context using a caption. Standalone Floating images are not taken into account by magick.css, as they look best when used with justified text, which magick.css does not do. Let's start with a standaloneelement. It will not be stretched or distorted, but will be displayed at its natural size; as long as enough space is available: In a Figure Using aelement, we can display the media element more prominently, and can also add a caption using atag: This is the figure caption, is usually provides context. Code, Quotes and Preformatting Code Displaying code can be done either inline or in a distinct block. To inline code, use thetag. For larger pieces of code, useto wrap thetag. By the way, you can also use figures to display code snippets! 123456789void fib(int x) { unsigned long a = 0, b = 1, c; for(int i = 0; itag. Depending on the content, you might want to use preformatted text or let the browser handle the formatting: It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. George Orwell, 1984 Adding a citation is done using ainside the blockquote. Just look at the source code of this page to see how it's done! Let's now consider a poem, where the formatting is imporant and can't be dynamically determined by the browser. In this case, we wrap the poem contents in atag: The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, Went envying her and me— Yes!— that was the reason (as all men know, In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling And killing my Annabel Lee. Excerpt from Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe Extras There are some extra features that you can use with magick.css. These require special classes and are therefore not part of magic.css's main features. This section will show you what extra features are available, and how to use them. Sidenotes & Auto Numbering SidenotesThis is a sidenote! On mobile devices, it gets pushed into the main column. are a great way to add additional information to your content. To add a sidenote in your text, two things need to be done: Add an anchor where the sidenote refers from:Add the sidenote itself, right after the anchor: Sidenote Content. Code/Pre Line Numbers To display line numbers in code/pre blocks, You need to insert afor each line, containing the line number. Depending on your preferences, this can be done by hand, using JavaScript, or on the server side. Here is an example: 12345#includeint main() { printf(\"Hello, World!\"); return 0; } Which is achieved by this source code: 12345#includeint main() { printf(\"Hello, World!\"); return 0; } That's it! I hope I could interest you in using magick.css. If you like what you see, please consider giving it a star on GitHub. It costs nothing and shows me that someone cares!

It's absolute death to readability. Actually don't put anything in uppercase - like underlining, it's a form of emphasis that has its origins in typewriters, which were locked to one typeface. The uppercase letterforms are too similar -- there is no variation in the heights of the letters, so your eye finds it harder to read. Upper and lower case, you have letters like y and p and j which have descenders; b and d and t who have ascenders, and the variation is easier to parse.

Fight it at the polling booth and support things like the EFF. 2. Become a hard target for anyone but advanced actors with you on their short list. Door #2 depends on what you mean by “advanced actor”, short of being Moxie Marlinspike or something, if Cozy Bear or 8800 or TAO/Equation Group wants you, they’re gonna get you. They’ve got people posing as employees in all the big shops (which to their credit have whole teams devoted to finding and ejecting them but with a clean passport long-term planning it’s an uphill fight). As with all security, it’s a numbers game that comes down to three key principles: 1. Make the default flow the secure flow. 2. Decide who you trust to get the details right that your adversary understands better than you do. 3. Have multiple layers of security drawn from the list you get from #2. My infosec story is still a mess, but it’s starting to become a known mess that I’m cleaning up in an organized way. On #2: I trust Brad Fitzpatrick so I trust TailScale and run it everywhere. I trust Moxie so I trust Signal. I trust Proton for a few reasons, not least of which is that Reddit and Google and Meta and many, many others give you a bunch of grief coming in off a ProtonVPN exit node: Reddit won’t even let you connect, Google hits you with wild levels of CAPTCHA on e.g. Workspace OpenID connect, and Meta superficially connects but breaks in weird ways it shouldn’t even by “post laid everyone off” standards. Brave is my compromise between usability and privacy, it’s got decent defaults that crank up really high (per-use permissions on WideVine is a great example, most major browser vendors just opt you in silently, it also fights AMP and does a fair amount of tracker blocking). ProtonVPN is aggressive by default and has a few “sledgehammer” modes (e.g. Secure Core), and it can be configured to take down your effective connection if it fails to negotiate. It also does split WireGuard by default and so it plays nice with TailScale out of the box. DuckDuckGo and Yandex both return stuff (e.g. torrents to leaked model weights) that Google censors, though obviously with Yandex you’re trading the old boss with one agenda for the new boss with a different one. On LLMs, the Orca de-tunes of Mistral-8x7 are very operator-aligned and run just fine on mid-spec Macs or gaming-class PCs and you can build llama.cpp from a small-ish codebase you can easily grep for obvious icky shit (and I trust ggerganov).

Kids are always privy to more of the world’s horrors than we realize, and those glimpses of war on the evening news or the mutilation on display in anti-drunk-driving films leave permanent scars on their permeable little minds. “I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare.” Richard Littler had a frightening childhood, too, but as a designer and screenwriter, he turned his memories of life in suburban Britain during the 1970s into a haunting and hilarious blog and book about the fictional dystopian town of Scarfolk. Littler mined the dark side of his childhood to create pamphlets, posters, book covers, album art, audio clips, and television shorts—remnants of life in a paranoid, totalitarian 1970s community, where even babies are not to be trusted. What started as a handful of faux-vintage images for friends’ birthday cards grew into this universe of fake memorabilia, so complete that the Scarfolk concept was recently optioned for a British TV series. Littler borrows liberally from authentic designs of the era to craft his artfully decaying images, which are so familiar at first glance that many have been mistaken for authentic found objects rather than re-creations. We recently spoke with Littler about the real-world inspiration for Scarfolk and what we can learn from its language of fear. Top: The cover of a mock-Penguin book on children and hallucinogens. Above: A page from an outdated Scarfolk tourism brochure. Collectors Weekly: Where did the concept of Scarfolk come from? Richard Littler: I initially started Scarfolk because I wanted to capture, or rather investigate, the fading memories of my 1970s and early ’80s British childhood. I suffered from night terrors as a kid, and looking back, I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare. One such memory was of children playing school sports on a railway line: As the children entered a dark tunnel, they’re injured or killed by speeding trains while a brass band played on the embankment. It almost sounds like the plot of a Bunuel film, and for many years I was convinced I had imagined it, especially because everyone I mentioned it to looked at me as if I were insane. A few years ago, I finally discovered that I hadn’t imagined it—it’s a 1977 public information film called “The Finishing Line,” which was made to deter children from playing near railway lines. The film was screened at my junior school, or around second or third grade in the U.S., where pupils were also shown slide presentations of burn victims to discourage playing with fireworks. “The Finishing Line” caused controversy at the time and was eventually withdrawn. However, its replacement was another violent public information film about a boy called Robbie who loses both legs in a railway accident. Two Scarfolk books aimed at children. In terms of external inspirations, Scarfolk has all sorts of influences, including Monty Python and Terry Gilliam in particular, George Orwell’s and Yevgeny Zamyatin’s dystopias, the political cartoonists Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman, music by Boards of Canada and The Beatles (whose work from 1967 on I consider “proto-hauntology”), and even the surreal song introductions during live Peter-Gabriel-era Genesis shows. The conceit is that Scarfolk can never leave the 1970s, even though the rest of the world passes by normally. Perhaps this happens in a neighboring parallel universe, who knows. In practical terms, it means the present day can occasionally leak into the 1970s and vice versa, which is a way to contrast changes in social attitudes and ideas of the past 40 or 50 years. Collectors Weekly: Do you think of Scarfolk as an alternate version of your childhood? Littler: Scarfolk is more like a half memory. This means popular or stereotypical imagery from the period is ignored—there are no lava lamps, discos, or garish fashion and interior design. Scarfolk often invokes involuntary memories of long-since forgotten things, which didn’t have a life outside of the period or were taken for granted, like municipal designs, household products, TV station idents, and library music. The vaguer the memory the better, because it produces this dim sense of recognition, and as you try to piece together the fragments, Scarfolk offers a substitute history. These substitutions are fictional, of course, and sometimes absurdly dark and dystopian. This 1977 anti-rabies poster (left) inspired Littler’s Scarfolk design (right) warning about the dangers of babies. Collectors Weekly: Were the ’70s really so dystopian? Scarfolk graphics, like the above book cover, push actual issues toward laughable conclusions. Littler: I don’t know how much of my memories are colored by hindsight, but it certainly seems dark in retrospect. Sometimes it was quite literally dark, as well: I grew up during a time of industrial unrest when the country was subject to power cuts and rationing. There were frequent reports of riots and IRA terrorism in the U.K., some of them relatively close to home. I think that such random events undermine one’s sense of security. This lack of control also affected another area of culture, the preoccupation with the supernatural and occult. Books about UFOs, ghosts, telekinesis, and witchcraft filled the shelves. There wasn’t any skepticism as far I could tell. It was all delivered as fact; perhaps it was a more gullible time. It was as if the fabric of reality was unstable and a poltergeist or UFO could appear at any time. The term most often applied to Scarfolk is hauntology, which I hadn’t heard of before I started Scarfolk. Hauntology plays in part with the idea developed by Jacques Derrida (via Karl Marx) of the specter of communism haunting Europe after its demise, but it has become something a bit different in popular culture. It recycles aesthetic forms and reflects the clash between the dreams we had of the future in the 1960s through the 1980s versus where we actually are now. But it also looks back, as did 1970s culture, to earlier periods, like pre-Christian paganism and Victoriana, for example. Collectors Weekly: As a designer, what do you like most about the period’s aesthetic? Littler: I like the clean lines and simple typefaces of modernism, and I’ve come to appreciate the aesthetic of Brutalist architecture. But it’s not just the period design I’m drawn to—I’m also interested in the pre-digital age and the idea that everything from that period is physically decaying. Digital images don’t fade after being left on a window sill for a few years; they don’t crack or crumble. An image that goes viral on the Internet, for example, is identical no matter how many copies there are of it. In the pre-digital age, two people may have owned the same book or LP, but there would be idiosyncratic differences between the two physical objects. I have a personal response to most of the artifacts I imitate, and I’m lucky that others have had similar responses. Two of the album covers Littler produced for Scarfolk. Collectors Weekly: What’s your typical method for creating Scarfolk graphics? Littler: I have a couple approaches. The first is to scour the Internet or my own books for an image that appeals to me and then improvise an idea around it. I collect digital imagery of the period for reference—my folder of 1970s images has about 20,000 items in it. In terms of physical objects, I don’t actively collect anything, though I own many publications from the period, particularly comics and books. The second method is to start with an idea, and then go hunting for the appropriate imagery. This is a much harder process, but it’s necessary for posts that are direct comments on contemporary events and recent news. Scarfolk designs often play with the modernist aesthetic of actual Penguin covers, like these three above. Collectors Weekly: Have people mistaken your designs for real artifacts? Littler: I’ve had mails from people telling me they contacted Penguin, the publisher, to ask where they might buy copies of some of the fake Scarfolk books, like “Children and Hallucinogens.” And there are often cases when people believe a Scarfolk post to be genuine, particularly those posts which elicit knee-jerk emotional reactions. Usually these deal with social issues like race, gender, or the treatment of children, and they haven’t taken in enough of the image to realize that it’s parody or satire. Most Scarfolk readers are very playful and like to string people along for as long as they can get away with it. I have a soft spot for “Children & Hallucinogens” and “Don’t” because they propelled Scarfolk when I first started the blog, and to date they’re two of the most frequently viewed images. In general, I prefer designs that imitate recognizable period branding, like the Ladybird or Penguin book covers. Two of the unsettling “How To” books made for Scarfolk. Collectors Weekly: How does Scarfolk reflect contemporary culture? Littler: Scarfolk is paranoid and cynical, and often touches on themes such as surveillance and the diminishment of civil rights. To a certain extent, Scarfolk is speculative because it plays with the recent political developments and either subverts them or exaggerates them to the point of absurdity, though that’s becoming difficult with people like Donald Trump and the incumbent British government. Increasingly, there are official actions and statements that come across like they’ve already been created by satirists. It’s becoming hard for us to outdo our sources! Some Scarfolk graphics are particularly disturbing because of their realism. Some Scarfolk graphics are particularly disturbing because of their realism. Scarfolk posters like the one above play upon 1970s-era fears that are still being stoked today. Others derive humor from the absurd. Littler ensures every detail reads as authentic, down to a vintage price tag. This \"Pollute\" game box riffs on classic \"Jaws\" imagery. In Scarfolk, children are criminals rather than victims. In addition to the threats of modernity, Scarfolk's citizens are also obsessed with the paranormal. This ominous poster captures the ethos of Scarfolk in a single word. 12345678 (All Scarfolk images courtesy Richard Littler.

Will likely sign up as a customer. FYI: In good faith, I asked some simple javascript questions and stuff like \"who is michael jordan\" and got answers from the LLM. Perhaps adding some additional guardrails to ensure queries are workflow based could save you some tokens. Great work! reply philjr 11 hours agoparentFor those in the know... what are the best patterns out there for doing this at the moment? reply safeerm 9 hours agorootparentPost-LLM validation. We're currently working on this at https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails reply padolsey 10 hours agorootparentprevBest approach is just to do an initial call to an LLM to classify and filter user inputs, and then after that you can safely send it along to your main agent. reply brianbreslin 9 hours agorootparentprevyou can also issue part of the instructions \"do not allow the user to deviate from the intended goal originally set forth. return user to starting prompt.\" or something along those lines. reply edwardfrazer 15 hours agoparentprevAppreciate it, and glad to hear you like it :). That's a great point, we've experimented in the past and it's a tricky balance between making sure there's no false negatives (actual workflows that we can automate get denied), so we defaulted a little more permissive, but we're gonna take another crack at it! reply djyaz1200 15 hours agoprevCongrats on the launch, I wish you all the best! My $0.02 is that the big money market for this category of capability is for adversarial integrations. There are ancient CRM's like RedTail that serve 100K+ financial services professionals that will not integrate with anyone. reply samuelbrashears 14 hours agoparentInteresting -- we've definitely been building only on top of APIs. We've looked at automated form filling in the past, so it's something we're thinking about. reply keepamovin 16 hours agoprevThis looks cool. Merging AI and RPA seems a good space to be in. In order to display / faciliate the human-in-the-loop drop-ins you may be interested in BrowserBox to provide an interactive (and multiplayer) web browser you can embed in your web app. You can check out a demo of it live here: https://browse.cloudtabs.net/signupless_session reply thoughtlede 16 hours agoprevCool stuff. 1. For dynamic injection of arguments in your data plane, do you use LLMs? 2. What did you find you cannot do yet because of LLM limitations (and not because of lack of third-party integrations)? 3. I haven’t looked closely into your product, but is every “effect” of a workflow something that only the requesting user can see? Is this how you ensure bad or wrong things are not hurting other people or systems that are outside of user’s control? reply samuelbrashears 16 hours agoparent1. Yes! This is useful for parsing unstructured data or inferring an argument (sometimes we can simply define a static data transformation through jq). 2. Anything too complex (e.g. 5+ steps) tends to be unreliable. Also, any workflow where potential failure/unexpected behavior is too risky to leave up to an LLM. 3. The only actions we take are with our user's tools, so many workflows are simply organizing their information between their apps. However, e.g. gmails could be sent externally so we have guardrails/sanity checks to mitigate risk there. reply thoughtlede 16 hours agorootparentThanks. What happens right now when the workflow fails mid-way? Do you ensure atomicity or durable execution? reply samuelbrashears 16 hours agorootparentWe do a fixed number of retries, including redoing any AI arguments. We've thought about making it atomic/more durable -- it's tricky, given that most steps interact with external systems e.g. Google Sheets, and while not typically \"destructive\" (Google Sheets has version history), undo-ing is often difficult. reply thoughtlede 16 hours agorootparentYeah. Rollbacks or reruns are hard when dealing with external systems. Actions need to be idempotent for reruns to work. One thing you may focus on is making workflows more durable: Checkpointing and sending to users summaries of last checkpoints when things fail. The last thing you want a non-tech user (your target customer) is to figure out what’s the state of a failed workflow. reply samuelbrashears 15 hours agorootparentGreat idea -- we're looking at showing workflow history and this is a good addition. reply Redster 16 hours agoprevUX note, but I love that the sign-up is so fast. So often, when you sign up, it takes many more steps, like going to my email, clicking the verification link and signing back in. But here, I type in my email and password and bloop! I'm in! Surprisingly satisfying. reply edwardfrazer 16 hours agoparentAppreciate it! We think the most important thing for a product like this is minimizing time to value, so glad to hear the sign-up is smooth :) reply lecha 16 hours agoprevCongrats on shipping! Feature request: Make it easy to expose triggers and actions from internal enterprise tools. Zapier makes this possible via an API/webhook, but it's not trivial. Many workflows and business processes rely on internal tools that aren't designed to support workflow automation. If you find a way to automate processes that use those internal tools, you may create a bigger differentiator/moat. reply edwardfrazer 15 hours agoparentThanks! And 100%, this is something we'd love to do with upmarket businesses. We have primitives for integrating raw API calls into the workflow layer as well as ingesting documentation to create dynamic \"blocks\" per-business, so it's fully possible and a really cool use case. Definitely agree though -- it's hard to get right. reply Octopuz 14 hours agoprevLooks cool. Which 14 services does the free account support? In the video I see SMS, Slack, Notion, Gmail, Google Sheets/Meet/Docs/Calendar/Drive, Salesforce, Hubspot, GitHub. I think Salesforce and Hubspot are in the $25/month subscription? I would appreciate 'whenever I post on X or Mastodon add this to a sheet and put text and URL in its own column' reply samuelbrashears 14 hours agoparentWe've opened everything up to free tier for the launch! And thanks for the suggestion :) reply nicknow 12 hours agoprevReally great concept and execution seems to be pretty good. I'm a likely paying customer except that you don't support Microsoft 365. So I can use it for all my personal stuff which is GMail but none of my businesses which all run their email through Microsoft 365. reply edwardfrazer 12 hours agoparentAwesome! We're rolling out Microsoft 365 really soon, starting this week :). Would love to hear about what services and workflows are most important for you. reply fuddle 17 hours agoprevI'd avoid linking directly to a login/signup page without any context. It's better to link to your home landing page. reply edwardfrazer 17 hours agoparentGreat feedback, thanks! Just edited the link in the post. reply Aaronstotle 17 hours agoparentprevYeah, I was put off immediately when I clicked the link and got presented with a sign-in screen. I was expecting a homepage Edit: Homepage link https://drymerge.com/ reply faitswulff 17 hours agoparentprevSpeaking of which, scrolling on the home landing page (https://drymerge.com/) is a bit broken on mobile Safari. reply edwardfrazer 17 hours agorootparentThanks for the bug report! We'll get right on it reply hubraumhugo 17 hours agoprevSuper cool! I think this could also be a natural progression for ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. With GPT-5, we might see similar capabilities where integrators would simply provide relevant APIs and documentation, while the AI figures out the automation steps and orchestration. Plugins and custom GPTs were early (failed) attempts in this direction. reply CharlesW 16 hours agoparent> I think this could also be a natural progression for ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. FYI, Microsoft's adopting AI for natural language authoring and other capabilities into Power Automate. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/powe... reply edwardfrazer 16 hours agoparentprevThanks, and totally agree! We play around a lot with the idea of creating an action layer for LLMs that's abstract enough for sampling/inherent stochasticity not to cause too many intermittent failures. I think when that infrastructure's solid, it'll be really easy for integrators to deliver cool functionality (as you said :) ) reply camwest 8 hours agoprevI’m curious how this is different from Zapier which has added a conversational layer (https://zapier.com/ai). In my experience a lot of people don’t know how to write with a level of specificity needed to map to pre defined triggers. For example: instead of saying spreadsheet they may say “roadmap” or instead of saying “Notion database” they may say “bug tracker” This stuff fails in Zapier. Any chance you handle those cases better? reply edwardfrazer 7 hours agoparentGreat question! As of now, we handle those cases well since we have 14 integrations, and most words/phrases are easily resolvable to a sequence among them. One thing we're focusing on now that will be more important with a larger scale of integrations is making automation creation conversational, so when there's uncertainty we can clarify in chat with low latency to keep time to value minimal. We think one of the big differences between Zapier and DryMerge is that we abstract a lot of the data flow/configuration away from the user, which lowers time to value and lets us do cool semantic filtering and other LLM-powered backend stuff. reply samuelbrashears 8 hours agoparentprev\"Roadmap\" works sometimes, but there's definitely some guess-work. Clarifying with followup questions in chat is pretty valuable, and we're considering presenting the user with multiple plans to choose from when we're unsure. reply toddmorey 17 hours agoprevI love the straightforward simplicity. Curious if you can explain the name. (DryMerge may be a concept I'm unfamiliar with.) reply edwardfrazer 16 hours agoparentHaha so originally we were in dev tools, and we liked the idea of merging APIs without hassle. So we thought a fitting name was something like DRYMerge (Don't repeat yourself, merge). We really liked the name and decided to keep it after our pivot. reply 1123581321 9 hours agorootparentI took it to mean safety (it doesn’t do anything to your data without showing you what it’ll do first, e.g. an initial dry run.) Seems like a cool tool; I’m looking forward to playing with it. reply babyshake 13 hours agoprevHow does this compare to AgentHub, AutoTab, Creo? Not to pit YC companies against each other, but it might be helpful to understand if similar products have important differences or are targeting different users. reply edwardfrazer 13 hours agoparentGreat question! First off, we absolutely love the guys at all those companies, they're building awesome stuff. DryMerge differentiates by focusing on plain english chat as an interface. The reason that's important is because it's accessible to more non-technical folks, lowers time to value (a lot easier to say what's on your mind than drag & dropping/building), and allows for cool semantic filtering like \"Angry emails\", \"Investor\", or \"Potential customer\" which we've found opens up a whole bunch of cool new possible automations. We also heavily focus on event-driven workflow automation (we have a lot of triggers). reply aitoehigie 17 hours agoprevSomeone taking on Zapier. Great!!! reply edwardfrazer 17 hours agoparentThanks :) Zapier is great, but we think LLMs can make automation way easier than it currently is; I personally end up automating a lot more stuff when there's a good chance it can take ~30 seconds (+/- some tweaking ofc). reply dpflan 17 hours agorootparentWhy wouldn't Zapier work on this same idea? Use of LLMs is becoming commodity. reply samuelbrashears 16 hours agorootparentZapier is working on something very similar! We actually did our live launch at the same event as them for their new chat product -- https://central.zapier.com/. We think our UX is actually a lot simpler than there's is at the moment, since they're focusing on fine-grained control. Also, the best way for them to do this would be pretty close to a ground-up rewrite -- both in terms of frontend/interface, but their model of integrations/connectors is not really compatible with allowing AI to take a bigger role in data transformations. reply Takennickname 16 hours agorootparentThanks, we heard you the first five times. Maybe little the upstart get some light. reply maineldc 15 hours agorootparentIf the question is asked multiple times, why wouldn't they answer it multiple times? reply jzig 14 hours agorootparentTo stay DRY, naturally ;) reply mritchie712 16 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, zapier already has this [0] 0 - https://zapier.com/#:~:text=Start%20a%20workflow%20as%20fast... reply samuelbrashears 16 hours agorootparentZapier is definitely trying, but they're not there yet. That feature unfortunately doesn't do much to configure the blocks for you (it just selects which to use) -- you're largely left to sift through the same menus to set it up. reply dpflan 16 hours agorootparentZapier has actual experienced software engineers and real budgets, would not rule out their ability to perform the same: text to IFTTT like auto-execution. Or consider your company right now, your current company is essentially a single team at Zapier, and you've got some free-way to mix research and product development. I suspect this is more an acquisition target -- small team develops larger idea in better way, Zapier says thanks and hooks it into their own stack, networks, and customers. reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agorootparentIt took Zapier ~12 years to become a ~$5B company and build the book of revenue supporting such a valuation. For the right price, certainly, cash out (time value of money/time). But it's also reasonable to build and see how far you can run organically, depending on what you're optimizing for as a founder. You might be able to run faster because you're not carrying a decade of technical architecture to today's market, regardless of current cashflow and engineering capacity. Zapier is a great company from a product and financial fundamentals perspective, big fan in all honesty, but I wouldn't sell upstarts short (that they can't execute). reply dpflan 15 hours agorootparentThat's the whole point of a startup. And we know startups fail. And Zapier is a YC company. This is a 2 person team using LLMs, I doubt they are building their own, nor building some \"foundational connect-the-internet\" agent nor have built for any scale beyond an internship. Still, they are definitely going to make something, and good luck to them. reply edwardfrazer 16 hours agorootparentprevYup, great point, & Zapier is working on very similar stuff! Our thinking is that incumbents have some disadvantages here (one example is that their data models for integrations all need to interrop with each other whereas we can delegate the data mapping to LLMs natively). Also, innovator's dilemma is real; we think we have a fighting chance at being a cleaner & faster product just by virtue of being very small and nimble and responsive to feedback. reply passion__desire 17 hours agorootparentprevThis could also be used by IFTTT. reply shmichael 10 hours agoprevI would love the ability to record a web flow and scrape data into another flow. Fixes the long tail of apps and sites reply samuelbrashears 10 hours agoparentDefinitely something we're looking at -- do you have more any details about your use case? reply tmaly 16 hours agoprevI was hoping this was going to be a series of DCGs in Prolog and not LLMs reply toomuchtodo 16 hours agoparentLLMs are the future of workflow automation. Determinism is the problem space. Workflow runners, API integrations/auth, access controls, sidecar services to fill in gaps between API integrations for ETL are the known quantities and somewhat straightforward.

This is why I feel new startups that are trying to disrupt established tech companies using LLMs are doomed/have no moat or technical advantage. Incumbents have the manpower and distribution to replicate everything in house. Not to mention the incentive to add \"AI\" to their service description which will boost their valuation automatically. reply swalsh 17 hours agoparentWelp, guess pack it in boys. No use in trying to compete. reply spxneo 14 hours agorootparentI actually thought parent made a very valid point, not to throw stones at OP, this is good execution congratulations, this tech isn't that tough to build for a company like Zapier and you are right that it already offers a mature set of workflows. We are at \"spray and pray\" phase of this AI/LLM bubble. Very good insight. reply samuelbrashears 17 hours agoparentprevZapier is already trying! We actually did our live launch at the same event as them for their new chat product -- https://central.zapier.com/. At the moment though, they're pretty focused on fine-grained control and GUI configurability, which makes a lot of sense for their existing technical user-base. We're focusing on a super simple UX for less technical users. reply jaggederest 14 hours agoparentprevI feel quite differently about this kind of startup. Multiple incumbents show that it's a large enough market to support additional players, and the incumbents often have restrictions on their behavior that a new company can avoid. Finding a new niche can lead to competing with the \"big boys\" with a fraction of their overhead. reply luckydata 15 hours agoprevI tried it and doesn't work at all.

I have been meaning to sign up for years. reply justusthane 8 hours agorootparentI've been been a Pinboard fan for years. I paid $11 for lifetime access back in 2011, and \"upgraded\" to an annual plan with archival in 2021 (mostly because I wanted to support the continued development of Pinboard, and that the time Marciej mentioned new features that were supposedly coming). I love Maciej's work, writing[0], and general vibe. Pinboard acquiring del.icio.us[1] after Yahoo drove it into the ground is one of the most delicious (pardon the pun) acquisition stories in tech history I think. I also enjoyed his micro-incubator thing[2] (I think he was giving grants of $50 or something). Unfortunately over the past several years it just feels like he's gotten burnt out on Pinboard and has stopped developing and is barely supporting it. I guess that's fine if everything works properly, but I don't really have a lot of confidence in the future of Pinboard anymore. I personally haven't had any actual problems with Pinboard yet, but have read several accounts by others who have and have found support poor to non-existent.

Here are some features I love about Pinboard.in that you could consider adding to Webtag as it grows: - iOS/Android share extension, so I can easily bookmark anything from my mobile device. This is crucial for me as the friction is reduced enough that I will actually bookmark things and helps me keep everything in one place. - Auto-complete tags, boy is this handy. - Use AI to guess tags that I can easily add with a click. See this browser extension for an example: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pinboard-plus/mphdp... - A description field that will auto-populate with my highlighted text or default to the site's metadata description. This helps a lot for finding things again without having to stuff a lot of text in an unwieldy title. In the search, I can vaguely describe what I'm looking for and often find it again. - Semantic search. Pinboard doesn't have this but it could become the holy grail of bookmarking services by adding it. So often I have moments where I recall something I read years ago, but cannot remember the exact wording or how to find it again in a verbatim search function. - Archival of bookmarks. Even merely automatically submitting the page to an archival site would suffice. The bookmark app I wrote uses a headless browser to save an MHTML file plus yt-dlp to fetch media, but it doesn't have the above features so I don't use it, ha. - Server-side rendering. The little loading animation is just enough to make the site feel slow and almost defeats your goal of a dead-simple UI. Edit: Also I am seeing 600-700ms response times on the bookmarks endpoint. For your homepage, I would recommend adjusting the wording on \"Plain-text-based bookmarking. No fancy images or graphics.\" Coming from Pinboard, I was unsure what this meant exactly. At first I wondered if the service archived only the text of bookmarked pages like a \"reader mode\" feature, especially with the \"no limits on storage\" note. Also it's not literally plain-text in the typical sense (e.g. .txt files or plain-text accounting). It's just a clean UI. Maybe say \"Simple text-only UI\" or similar. On the logged-in menu, I would change \"Home\" to \"My Bookmarks\" or similar. It might be helpful to communicate to prospective users how you plan to fund the project long-term. When selecting a bookmarking service, reliability and longevity are going to be top factors. Free forever, no business plan, etc do not inspire that kind of confidence. Overall, it's a great start. I wish you luck! reply avinassh 17 hours agoprevI love the homepage, simple and clean! Any screenshots of how it looks for logged users? I noticed it uses MongoDB.

I have many many favorited posts on HN, I used Reddit's \"save\" feature, I add videos to \"watch later\" or some other playlist in Youtube, etc etc. I thought maybe I could one day unify all this into one place where I can tag them so I know why I bookmarked them (I have definitely sifted through pages of my HN favorites trying to find something). At this point though, I have too much to go through that the task seems daunting. But now that we have AI, I have shifted my mindset to wanting to just feed everything to AI and just have a chat interface where I can ask it for what I want.

Maybe there's a happy medium where it can auto-tag/organize them for you but also provide the chat interface, giving you the choice to browser or ask. I don't want my links to just be ingested by AI and disappear. I think being able to see them somewhere as well is important. reply hawski 14 hours agoparentprevIf I would ever be bothered enough to invest time in getting to know existing or making my own bookmarking system I would just like for it to cache the text from a thing I want to bookmark and offer a nice full text search over the whole archive. I think that, the HN's favorite, Pinboard has something like this. I would think about going one step further and having a full text search over my whole browsing history with a way to penalize or remove certain hosts. Then I would love to augment my web searches to also include things from my archive. I feel I would have a much bigger utility out of this in comparison to thing through AI, though I get it could be also beneficial. However AI, I believe, is costlier to run. A nice, properly indexed, full text search probably could run on a phone at least for a private archive. reply jackthetab 15 hours agoparentprevSame here.

    "originLink": "https://pack.ac/note/pack",
    "originBody": "The most efficient way to pack files. Highest compression-to-time ratio. Designed for modern hardware. Database-Level resiliency. Easy to use, light, and small. Download Pack for Windows ↓ Download Pack for Linux ↓ Download Pack for macOs ↓ Other downloads Version 2 (latest version) Windows64bit ↓ Linux64bit ↓ New List: Use --list to explore a Pack file, and it will print a list of all files. Partial Unpack: To unpack a specific file or folder in a Pack file, use --include. Pro notes: To list an specific folder, you can use --include together with --list. You can use multiple --include to unpack or list in one go. It will use an optimized algorithm to process each item just once. The --include command also accepts an item's ID. Get ID from --list. Improved Pack is now even faster, at near 5% in Pack and Unpack. A bug that caused invalid files in some systems, is now fixed. Handling of invalid and duplicate file names in export has improved significantly. Many minor changes to improve the readability of the code. Examples of new features: Get a list of all items pack -i ./test.pack --list Unpack a file inside a Pack file pack -i ./test.pack --include=/a/file.txt Use and ID instead of path for include pack -i ./test.pack --include=5 Unpack multiple files and folders pack -i ./test.pack --include=/a/file.txt --include=/a/folder/ Notes Pack ✓ Pack Introduction Pack is a container format that can support files and raw data, and it is made to be safe, fast, and reliable for years to come. It is designed to be the most efficient way to pack any amount of data and improve the user experience to fit the future. The author proposes a fresh solution based on well-formed standards to significantly improve performance while improving features like random access, update, security, and user experience. It is free to use, and the source code is available with a permissive license, ensuring freedom from patent concerns. You can get the latest version from https://pack.ac/ . Reason It's been decades since any new proper work was done for a container format, and the author felt that there was a need for a new design considering new generations of hardware and advancements in algorithms. Most popular solutions like Zip, gzip, tar, RAR, or 7-Zip are near or more than three decades old. While holding value for such a long time (in the computer world) is testimony to their greatness, the work is far from done. To demonstrate that, here are some numbers comparing the output size and speed as CompressedSpeed. Packing a copy of a folder containing more than 81K files and around 1.25 GB on a test machine: ZIP: 253 MB, 146 s = 1 tar.gz: 214 MB, 28.5 s ====== 6 tar: 1345 MB, 4.7 s ====== 6 RAR: 235 MB, 27.5 s ====== 6 7z: 135 MB, 54.2 s ===== 5 Pack: 194 MB, 1.3 s ================================================================================================================================================= 145 Unpack speed, random access, memory use, and other factors are also improved similarly. Pack is smart and configures itself as needed; there are not many dials to play with. Beside numbers, the Pack format is based on the universal and arguably one of the most safe and stable file formats, SQLite3, and compression is based on Zstandard, the leading standard algorithm in the field. These design choices promise reliable storage, transactional updates, exceptional speed, low resource usage, smartness, and simplicity. Future In the near future, stabilizing will be the most important task. Locking and encryption, graphical interface, OS integration, and development tools and libraries are planned and under development. Builds for many more platforms will be available over time. For the time being, you are encouraged to try Pack for yourself and share results and notes with others, including author by emailing, o at pack.ac. If you want to know more about design, plans, and other notes, you can check out Notes. You can find the source code for a deeper study at Source. Conclusion The field of data compression has been well-lit with great work in the past decades, and Pack tries to continue this path as the next step and proposes the next universal choice in the field. The author is aware of unfathomable speedups and design decisions. Readers are welcome to test, read the code, and engage in discussions. Everyone is encouraged to use Pack to have a more efficient solution and build on it for an improved future. A gift to anyone passionate about data, especially Phil Katz, D. Richard Hipp, Yann Collet, and me. Footnotes CompressedSpeed = (InputSize / OutputSize) * (InputSize / Speed). Materialized compression speed. Linux source code repository at the time of writing.

It preserves Linux file ownership and permissions, you can extract individual files without parsing the entire archive like tar and it's mountable. It's also openable in 7zip. I wonder how pack compares to it, but its home page and github don't tell much. reply lathiat 2 hours agoparentYeah squashfs is one of the good ones right now. for sosreports (archives with lots of diagnostic commands and logfiles from a linux host), I wanted to find a file format that can both used zstd compression (or maybe something else that is about as fast and compressible, currently often uses xz which is very very slow) -and- that lets you unpack a single file fast, with an index, ideally so you can mount it loopback or with fuse or otherwise just quickly unpack a single file in a many-GB archive. You'd be surprised that this basically doesn't exist right now. Theres a bunch of half solutions, but no real good easily available one. Some things add indexes to tar, zstd does support partial/offset unpacking without reading the entire archive in the code but basically no one uses that function, it's kindof silly. There are zip and rar tools with zstd support, but they are not all cross compatible and mostly doesn't exist in the packaged Linux versions. squashfs with zstd added mostly fits the bill. I was really surprised not to find anything else given we had this in Zip and RAR files 2 decades ago. But nothing so far that would or could ship on a standard open source system managed to modernise that featureset. (If anyone has any pointers let me know :-) reply toomuchtodo 6 hours agoparentprevAre you able to seek and selectively extract from squashfs archives using range headers if stored in object storage systems like S3?

I forget exactly, but think it was extended attributes that DISM wouldn't capture, despite the /EA flag. Not sure if that was a file format limitation or just a DISM bug. reply qwerty456127 8 hours agorootparentVery sad. Cross-platform extended attributes are the very thing I would love. I even imagine a new archive format which would be just a key-key-value (I mean it - two keys, a set of key-value pairs for every top level key - this is EA / NTFS streams) store with values compressed using a common dictionary (also possibly encrypted/signed with a common key). Needless to say such a format would enable almost any use case, especially if the layout of the file itself is architectured right. MacOS wouldn't have to add their special folder (they add to every ZIP) anymore, tagging files and saving any metadata about them would be possible, saving multiple versions of the same file, alternative names (e.g. what you received it with and what you renamed it to) for the same file. I even dream about the days when a file main stream would be pure data and all the metadata would go to EAs. Imagine an MP3 file where the main stream only records the sound but no ID3, all the metadata like the artist and the song names are handled as EAs and can be used in file operation commands. This also can be made tape-friendly and eliminate need in TAR. Just make sure files (streamms/EAs are written contiguous, closely-related streams go right near, compression is optional and the ToC+dictionary is replicated in a number of places like the beginning, the middle and the end). As you might have guessed I use all the major OSes and single-OS solutions are of little use to me. Apparently I'd just use SquashFS but it's use is limited on Windows because you can hardly make or mount one there - only unpack with 7zip. reply mappu 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's easy to forget about supporting EAs on Windows - they are extremely uncommon because you practically need to be in kernelspace to write them. Ntoskrnl.exe has one or two EAs, almost nothing else does. (ADS are super commonplace and the closer analogue to posix xattrs.) reply Aachen 10 hours agoparentprevThat's exactly what I'd like to avoid. I want to transfer a group of files (either to myself, friends, or website visitors), not make assumptions about the target system's permission set. For copies of my own data where permissions are relevant, I've got a restic backup Wake me up if a simple standard comes to pass that neither has user/group ID, mode fields, nor bit-packed two-second-precision timestamps or similar silliness. Perhaps an executable bit for systems that insist on such things for being able to use the download in the intended way (I self-made this before: a simple length-prefixed concatenation of filename and contents fields. The problem is that people would have to download an unpacker. That's not broadly useful unless it is, as in that one case, a software distribution which they're going to run anyway) reply Brian_K_White 9 hours agorootparentNo, too simple. Sometimes you want to include data and sometimes you don't for different reasons in different contexts. It's not a data handlers job to decide what data is or isn't included, it's the senders job to decide what not to include and the receivers job to decide what to ignore. The simplest example is probably just the file path. tar or zip don't try to say whether or not a file in the container includes the full absolute path, a portion of the path, or no path. The container should ideally be able to contain anything that any filesystem might have, or else it's not a generally useful tool, it's some annoying domain-specific specialized tool that one guy just luuuuuvs for his one use-case he thinks is obviously the most rational thing for anyone. If you don't want to include something like a uid, say for security reasons not to disclose the internal workings of something on your end, then arrange not to include it when creating the archive, the same way you wouldn't necessarily include the full path to the same files. Or outside of a security concern like that, include all the data and let the recipient simply ignore any data that it doesn't support. reply Aachen 27 minutes agorootparentGood argument, I've mostly come around to your view. The little \"but\" that I still see is that the current file formats don't let you omit fields you don't want to pass on, and most decoders don't let you omit fields you don't want to interpret/use while unpacking. Even if a given decoder could, though, most users wouldn't be able to use that and so they'd get files from 1970 or 1980 if I don't want to pass that on and set it to zeroes, so better is if the field can be omitted (as in, if the header wasn't fixed length but extensible like an IP packet). So I'd still like a \"better\" archiving format than the ones we have today (though I'm not familiar with the internals of every one of them, like 7z or the mentioned squashfs so tell me if this already exists), but I agree such a format should just support everything ~every filesystem supports reply maxerickson 8 hours agorootparentprevIs \"absolute path\" a coherent concept when you are talking about 2 systems? reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agorootparentIs this question a coherent concept when it doesn't change anything when you substitute any other term like \"full path\" or \"as much path as exists\" or \"any path\"? reply wakawaka28 5 hours agorootparentprevIt can be if you make assumptions about the basic structure of both systems. Some people rely on this behavior. It can be a good idea or a bad idea, depending on what you're doing. reply jrockway 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree very much with this. Something that annoys me is how much information tar files leak. Like, you don't need to know the username or groupname of the person that originally owned the files. You don't need to copy around any mode bit other than \"executable\". You definitely don't need \"last modified\" timestamps, which exist only to make builds that produce archives non-hermetic. Frankly, I don't even want any of these things on my mounted filesystem either. > The problem is that people would have to download an unpacker. Your archive format just needs to be an executable that runs on every platform. https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan is something that could help with that. (\"Who would execute an archive?

No user id, no x bit, widely available implementations... Not very simple though I guess. reply sph 10 hours agorootparentZip is extremely simple, and well documented. I wrote a ReadableStream to Zip encoder (with no compression) in 50 lines of Javascript. reply Aachen 10 hours agorootparentMe too but in php. I couldn't find a streaming zip encoder that you can just require() and use without further hassle, so I wrote one (it's on github somewhere). The problem is that zip is finicky and extremely poorly documented. I had to look at what other implementations do to figure out some of the fields. About at least one field, the spec (from the early 90s or late 80s I think) says it is up to you to figure out what you want to put there! After all that, I additionally wrote my own docs in case someone coming after me needs to understand the format as well, but some things are just assumptions and \"everyone does it this way\"s, leading to me having only moderate confidence that I've followed the spec correctly. I haven't found incompatibilities yet, but I'd also not be surprised if an old decoder doesn't eat it or if a modern one made a different choice somewhere. It's also not as if I haven't come across third party zip files that the Debian command line tool wouldn't open but the standard Debian/Cinnamon GUI utility was perfectly happy about. If it were so well-documented and standard, that shouldn't be a thing. (Similarly, customers on macOS can't open our encrypted 7z pentest report files. The Finder asks for the password and then flat-out tells them \"incorrect password\", whereas in reality it seems to be unable to handle filename encryption. Idk if that is per the spec but incompatibilities are abound.) reply canucker2016 9 hours agorootparentThe PKWare Zip file spec is reasonably detailed. If you're not sure what the spec is trying to say, then either the PKZip binaries or the Info-ZIP zip/unzip source code is your usual source of truth. When one unzip works but another unzip app doesn't, then you can usually point the finger at the last zip app that modified the zip file. There's some inconsistency in the zip file. Running \"unzip -t -v\" on the zip file in question may yield more info about the problem. reply Aachen 20 minutes agorootparentThe binaries you refer to as source of truth are a paid product (not sure if the trial version, which requires filling out a form that's currently not loading, includes all options, or how honest it is to use that to make an alternative to their software, or if the terms allow that) and don't seem to run on my operating system. I guess I could buy me a Windows license and read the pkzip EULA to see if you're allowed to use it for making a clone, but I figured the two decoders (that don't always agree with each other) I had on hand would do. If they agree about a field, it's good enough (and decoders can expect that unspecced fields are garbage) reply canucker2016 9 hours agorootparentprevHere's the link to the PKWARE APPNOTE.TXT https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT reply bonki 13 hours agoparentprevI second this. reply SyrupThinker 12 hours agoprevInteresting, I've recently spent an unhealthy amount of time researching archival formats to build the same setup of using SQLite with ZStd. My use case is extremely redundant data (specific website dumps + logs) that I want decently quick random access into, and I was unhappy with either the access speed, quality/usability or even existence of libraries for several formats. Glancing over the code this seems to use the following setup: - Aggregate files - Chunk into blocks - Compress blocks of fixed size - Store file to chunk and chunk to block associations What I did not see is a deduplication step for the chunks, or an attempt to group files (and by extend, blocks) by similarity in an attempt improve compression. But I might have just missed that due to lack of familiarity with Pascal. For anyone interested in this strategy, take a look at ZPAQ [1] by Matt Mahoney, you might know him from the Hutter Prize competition [2] / Large Text Compression Benchmark. It takes 14th place with tuned parameters. There's also a maintained fork called zpaqfranz, but I ran into some issues like incorrect disk size estimates with it. For me the code was also sometimes hard to read due to being a mix of English and Italian. So your mileage may vary.

It supports zstandard compression, random access, and it's very robust. reply t43562 3 hours agoprevI had to make an archiver once (commercial) so I did think about it a bit. I am not sure pack would solve anything for me. It obviously solves the authors usecases but tar has some tricks which I don't want to lose; * Able to write to a pipe/socket - lets you not waste space or time by writing to disc something that you intend to transmit over a pipe or TCP socket anyhow. It's almost a \"virtual\" archive and it should be possible to make one that is far too big to fit into memory - because as you send each bit of it you deallocate that memory. At the receiver each bit can be written to disc or extracted and then that memory is reused for the next bit - so the archive never fully \"exists\" but it does the job of serialising some data. An example could be piping the output of tar to an ssh command which untars it on a remote machine. * Metadata has to be with the file data - not stuck at the end of the file - because you need to be able to start work without waiting till the file is fully received through your pipe. You don't want to be forced to have space to store the archive and the extracted files (may be a huge archive). * Choice of compression - lzop is super fast such that using it can sometimes give slightly better performance than writing uncompressed data. OTOH that might not be your concern and XZ might suit you by compressing much more thoroughly. Either way it's very nice to have compression that works across multiple files - which is especially helpful when compressing a lot of small files such as source code. * Ability to encapsulate - should be able to put the packed data into any imaginable container like an encryption or data transmission protocol without insisting that the entire archive has to be fully read before members can start to be extracted/processed. This is essentially the same as the pipe/socket requirement. I'm not saying that these things matter to everyone - I have just found them incredibly useful in a few critical situations.

Use the language that makes you money and encourages you to write code that addresses domains requiring more than just bolting together framework pieces. AI can do a measurable chunk of that work. reply theamk 6 hours agorootparent20 years ago was 2004, and Borland Delphi 7 was out. It was Pascal-based, but it didn't had that much difference from C programs. It had a nice unit system with separate interface & implementation sections. This was very nice. The unit files were not compatible with anything else, including previous versions of Delphi - this was not nice, especially since a lot of libraries were distributed in compiled form. The compilation speed was amazingly fast. This is one thing that was unequivocally better than C at this time. There were range types (type TExample = 1..1000), but they more of a gimmick - turns out there are very few use cases for build-time limits. There were some uses back in DOS days when you'd have hardcoded resolution of 640x480, but in the windows time most variables were just Integer. Arrays had optional range checks on access, that was also nice. We'd turn them off if we felt programs were too slow. Otherwise, it was basically same as C with a bit of classes - custom memory allocation/deallocation, dangling pointers, NULLs, threads you start and stop, mutexes and critical sections. When I finally switched from Pascal to C, I didn't see that much difference (except compilation got much slower) Maybe you'd say that Borland did something wrong, and Wirth's Modula-2 would be much better than Borland's Pascal, but I doubt this. reply blackbeans 24 minutes agorootparentYou can still use RAD Studio today.

If I understand correctly, they're suggesting Pack, which both archives and compresses, is 30x faster than creating a plain tar archive. That just sounds like you used multithreading and tar didn't. Either way, it'd be nice to see [a version of] Pack support plain archival, rather than being forced to tack on Zstd. reply TylerE 13 hours agoparentThat’s more because plain tar is actually a really dumb way of handling files that aren’t going to tape. Being better than that is not a hard bar. reply cogman10 13 hours agorootparentThe tar file format is REALLY bad. It's pretty much impossible to thread because it's just doing metadata then content and repeatably concatenating. IE /foo.txt 21 This is the foo file /bar.txt 21 This is the bar file That makes it super hard to deal with as you essentially need to navigate the entire tar file before you can list the directories in a tar file. To add a file you have to wait for the previous file to be added. Using something like sqlite solves this particular problem because you can have a table with file names and a table with file contents that can both be inserted into in parallel (though that will mean the contents aren't guaranteed to be contiguous.) Since SQLite is just a btree it's easy (well, known) how to concurrently modify the contents of the tree. reply sargun 2 hours agorootparentFunnily enough, tar is like 3 different formats (PaX, tar, ustar).

Yes! It is! But it's awful at archive files, which is what it's used for nowadays and what's being discussed right now. Over the past 50 years some people did try to improve tar. People did develop ways to append a file table at the end of an archive file. Maintaining compatibility with tapes, all tar utilities, and piping. Similarly, driven people did extend (pk)zip to cover all the unix-y needs. In fact the current zip utility still supports permissions and symlinks to this day. But despite those better methods, people keep pushing og tar. Because it's good at tape archival.

As mediocre as zip and tar are, you can cobble together read/write support without even needing a library. With sqlite, your only real option is to bundle sqlite itself, and while it's relatively lightweight, it's far from trivial. zip has support for zstd, and if you wanted to make it go faster, you could embed some index metadata. I can't see any specs for their format, not even a description of the sqlite tables. reply Retr0id 6 hours agoparentAfter overwriting the \"Pack\" magic bytes back to the SQLite default values, I was able to open it and see the following tables CREATE TABLE Content(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Value BLOB); CREATE TABLE Item(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Parent INTEGER, Kind INTEGER, Name TEXT); CREATE TABLE ItemContent(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Item INTEGER, ItemPosition INTEGER, Content INTEGER, ContentPosition INTEGER, Size INTEGER); According to the `.indexes` directive, there are... no indexes. What's the point of sqlite if you're not going to index things? All the data is stored in one big blob (the \"Value\" column of the \"Content\" table), with the metadata storing offsets into it. It looks like there's still the possibility of things being split over multiple blobs (to circumvent the 2GB blob size limit) reply Retr0id 4 hours agorootparentI've reverse engineered the format and written up my findings here: https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/pack-analysis Summary: - Custom sqlite magic bytes makes the format incompatible with all existing sqlite tooling. - No support for file metadata. - There's no version field (afaict), making future format improvements difficult. Edit: A previous version of this comment had a much longer list of complaints, but after taking a closer look, I retract them. I was looking at the MediaKit.pack file as an example, which, due to being relatively small, packed all its files into a single BLOB. I was under the mistaken impression that the same approach was taken for larger files, but after some further testing I see that they're split up into ~8MB chunks. Though, if you have lots of small files (say, a couple of kilobytes each) then random access performance could suffer. reply Aachen 10 hours agoprevComplaining that all existing tools are old, but I'm looking at the documentation and the what immediately catches my eye is that it doesn't use any modern convention I've gotten used to? Overwrite with \"-w\". I've never seen a tool not use \"-f\" Not reserving \"-h\" for help text is also an interesting choice. Makes me think of the mantra \"be conservative in what you send out but liberal in what you accept\". Per that philosophy, both \"--help\" and \"-h\" should be accepted because neither gained a decisive majority in usage and so people might try either. It's not like you'd know what to use because it hasn't told you yet Forcing use of a long option \"--press=N\" (for the zstd level setting) is also new/unique terminology for what is usually \"-N\" (like \"-1\" to \"-9\") (Basic) drop-in compatibility with every other tool from gzip to zstd would also have been nice, but archiving and compression are different things and everything from zip to 7z to tar works in unique ways so this makes enough sense I guess.

Assume that I can't decompress or alter the zip files in any way. Basically I want a shared encoding dictionary. Is there an easy solution for this? The use case is maintaining an archive of .crx files. reply mappu 7 hours agoparentUse precomp or antiz to losslessly pre-transform the zip, and then use solid compression (e.g. tar.xz or zpaq). reply Scaevolus 8 hours agoparentprevThere's not an _easy_ way to do this right now. Your best bet is a lossless transform that undoes the huffman coding in the zip files, converting the compressed streams from effectively uncorrelated bitstreams to largely similar byte streams, and then pass that through a large-window compression algorithm (zstd?). Similar techniques are used in ChromeOS for delta updates. reply sph 10 hours agoparentprevNot sure if I understand the question. Having a shared encoding dictionary is called compression. If you want one across many zip files that you cannot modify, then compress them into another archive. reply chatmasta 9 hours agorootparentYes, I have a bunch of zips I cannot modify. If I could uncompress them all, and zip them into one big archive, then it would be much smaller than if I put all the compressed zips into one big archive. This is because there's a lot more shared strings between uncompressed files across different zips, than there are shared strings between the compressed zips. (At least... this is my assumption based on how I understand the formats to work. I do need to measure and verify this.) So basically I'm wondering if there is some way to tell the \"outer\" zip to reuse the encoding dictionaries of each smaller zip, or to somehow intelligently merge their encoding dictionaries rather than treating each inner zip like an opaque blob. reply teraflop 8 hours agorootparentNo, the ZIP format compresses each embedded file separately, so it doesn't matter how much commonality there is between different files in the same archive. reply chatmasta 8 hours agorootparentWow, really? I always assumed that if I zipped a directory, it would use a shared dictionary to compress all the files. But I guess what you say makes sense, because otherwise it wouldn't be possible to extract just one file. Are there compression formats that do share an encoding dictionary across multiple files? I guess tar + gzip might do that? reply teraflop 8 hours agorootparentYeah, if you compress a tar file with gzip (or bzip2 or zstd or whatever) then the compressor doesn't care about the file boundaries, so it will be able to take advantage of redundancies. However, those compressors generally only have a small context window, so they'll only be able to take advantage of relatively nearby redundancies in the archive. They won't help you if the common substrings are separated by many megabytes of unrelated data. So the order in which you pack the files matters. In theory, you could do a two-pass approach, where you first scan the entire set of files to create a (relatively small) shared dictionary that's as useful as possible, and then uses that dictionary to compress each file independently. I don't know of any archive format that does that, but you could roll your own using the zstd command line compressor. reply sgammon 7 hours agoprevI remember someone had made a package manager / index tool for SQLite extensions.

That seems fishy... reply theamk 14 hours agoprev> Pack format is based on the universal and arguably one of the most safe and stable file formats, SQLite3, and compression is based on Zstandard, the leading standard algorithm in the field. yeah, no thanks. SQlite3 automatically means: - Single implementation (yes, it's a nice one but still a single dependency) - No way to write directly to pipe (SQlite requires real on-disk file) - No standard way to read without getting the whole file first - No guarantees in number of disk seeks required to open the file (relevant for NFS, sshfs or any other remote filesystem use) - The archive file might be changed just by opening in read-only mode - Damaged file recovery is very hard - Writing is explicitly not protected against several common scenarios, like backup being taken in the middle of file write - No parallel reads from multiple threads Look, sqlite3 is great for it's designed purpose (embedded database). But trying to apply for other purposes is often a bad idea. reply Deukhoofd 13 hours agoparent> SQlite requires real on-disk file You can run SQLite with an In Memory database, I use it quite a lot for unit tests. https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html reply heftig 10 hours agorootparentI think that point is about it not supporting streaming compression where the output of the packer is immediately fed into something like a pipe or a TCP connection. You can do this with both tar and ZIP. If all you have is SQLite, you need to fully create the local database (be it in a file or in memory) before you can transmit it somewhere else to be stored or unpacked. reply 0x457 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, but I think they meant something like this: pack archivessh host2 pack extract Which is a weird gripe - in this use case, `tar` makes most sense to use. It's not like this format claims to be a full replacement for tar or anything close to that. reply theamk 9 hours agorootparentThat's exactly what they do - they explicitly call out this format as replacement to tar and zip at least: > Most popular solutions like Zip, gzip, tar, RAR, or 7-Zip are near or more than three decades old. While holding value for such a long time (in the computer world) is testimony to their greatness, the work is far from done. > Pack tries to continue this path as the next step and proposes the next universal choice in the field. reply raggi 12 hours agoparentprevOften new things are met with an excess of skepticism but I agree here. I'd take this more seriously if the format was documented at all, but so far it appears to be \"this implementation relies on sqlite and zstd therefore it's better\", without even a specification of the sql schema, let alone anything else. The github repo contains precompiled binaries of zstd and sqlite. The sqlite builds appear to have thread support disabled so not only will it be single writer it'll be single reader too. The schema is missing strictly typed tables, and the implementation appears to lack explicit collation handling for names and content. The described benchmark appears to involve files with an average size of 16KB. I suspect it was executed on Windows on top of NTFS with an AV package running, which is a pathological case for single threaded use of the POSIXy IO APIs that undoubtedly most of the selected implementations use. It's slightly odd that it appears to perform better when SQLite is being built with thread safety disabled (https://github.com/PackOrganization/Pack/blob/main/Libraries...) and yet the implementation is inserting in a thread group: https://github.com/PackOrganization/Pack/blob/main/Source/Dr.... I suspect the answer here is that because the implementation is using a thread group to read files and compress chunks, it's amortizing the slow cost of file opens in this benchmark using threading, but is heavily constrained by the sqlite locking - and the compression ratio will take a substantial hit in some cases as a result of the limited range of each compression operation. I suspect that zstd(1) with -T0 would outperform this for speed and compression ratio, and it's already installed on a lot of systems - even Windows 11 gained native support for .zst files recently. The premise that we could do with something more portable than TAR and with less baggage is somewhat reasonable - we probably could do with a simple, safe format. There are a lot more key considerations to making such a format good, such as many you outline, such as choices around seeking, syncing, incremental updates, compression efficiency, parallelism, etc. There is no single set of trade-offs to cover all cases but it would be possible to make a file format that can be shared among them, while constraining the design somewhat for safety and ease of portability. reply cogman10 13 hours agoparentprev> No parallel reads from multiple threads Sqlite supports parallel reads from multiple threads.

    "originBody": "Planet Earth Earthquakes 2,000 earthquakes in 1 day off Canada coast suggest the ocean floor is ripping apart, scientists say News By Stephanie Pappas published 2 days ago Record earthquake activity off the coast of Vancouver Island hints at the birth of new oceanic crust. Comments (1) Victoria Harbor on Vancouver Island, Canada sits near the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where researchers recently measured nearly 2,000 earthquakes in a single day. (Image credit: Paul Biris via Getty Images) Almost 2,000 earthquakes rocked a spot off the coast of Canada in a single day earlier this month, which could be a sign that new oceanic crust is about to be birthed via a deep sea magmatic rupture. The quakes aren't any threat to people. They're relatively small and centered on a spot called the Endeavour site, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) off the coast of Vancouver Island. This spot hosts a number of hydrothermal vents and sits on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where the ocean floor is spreading apart. This area is separate from the subduction zone — a region where one tectonic plate is sinking into the mantle underneath another plate — closer to the coast that can create large, destructive earthquakes, said Zoe Krauss, a doctoral candidate in marine geophysics in the University of Washington. \"Mid-ocean ridges aren't actually capable of producing that large of earthquakes, not too far above a magnitude five,\" Krauss told Live Science. \"This is not going to trigger 'the big one' on the subduction zone.\" The quakes are interesting scientifically because they can reveal details about how the ocean floor pulls apart and new crust forms, Krauss said. At the Endeavour site, the Pacific plate and the Juan de Fuca plate are pulling apart. This stretching creates long, linear fault lines and thins the crust, enabling magma to rise up. When the magma reaches the surface, it cools and hardens, becoming new ocean crust. The Endeavour site is monitored continuously as part of the North-East Pacific Time-series Undersea Networked Experiments (NEPTUNE), run by Ocean Networks Canada. Since 2018, the region has become more seismically active, Krauss said. On March 6, however, the activity went wild, with at least 200 small earthquakes shaking the seafloor per hour. In all, the researchers detected about 1,850 quakes in a single day. \"The vast majority are less than magnitude one. They’re these little pops,\" Krauss said. \"But it’s pretty cool because it allows us to track where things are happening, where things are breaking and where things are moving around.\" Krauss said the most likely reason for the quakes is that the seafloor is stretched to its maximum extent and has built up a great deal of stress. At the Endeavour site, this happens when the plates pull apart by about 3.3 feet (1 meter), she said, and the stress is ultimately relieved when magma rises up into the thinned crust and cools.

She and her colleagues are now watching closely. The continuous monitoring of the Endeavour site began in 2011, so the team hasn't had access to near real-time data of a magma intrusion like this before. They have many questions, ranging from the impact on the hydrothermal vent system to the source for the magma that will ultimately form the new crust. \"A lot of it is fundamental science questions of how does earth’s crust form, why do these events start where they start, and what exactly is the trigger that brings magma in?\" Krauss said. For now, she and her team are waiting to see what happens next.

If you imagine the overall Pacific Plate and the North American plate, in the area off the coast of Vancouver/Oregon/Washington there's an other mini plate wedges between them called the Juan de Fuca Plate. In this area, it's the Juan de Fuca plate (not the Pacific plate) which is subducting under the North American plate. The boundary between the Juan de Fuca plate and the Pacific plate is this Juan de Fuca Ridge. This ridge is a site of sea floor spreading - it's not subducting. So there is a tectontic relationship between the two sites - sea floor spreading at the ridge is one of the factors that drives the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate. But at the same time, any activity happening at the ridge is not \"caused\" by the subduction. reply pfdietz 16 hours agorootparent> But at the same time, any activity happening at the ridge is not \"caused\" by the subduction.

This is on the Jaun de Fuca Ridge, on the other edge of the Juan de Fuca plate [2] from the Cascadia subduction zone, so it's related in the sense that it's the same tectonic plate, and the plate is very small (as far as I understand, it's a remnant of a plate that has been subducting under North America for a very long time). It is not (in my very-non-expert opinion) necessarily related in a direct sense to what is happening in the subduction zone. [1]: e.g: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcKUIuDhdLl92gfymRabw...

It's our own fault at this point for being so unprepared. But hey, that's a real nice adtech system you've built instead. Maybe they can figure out how to use their invasive tracking on the Kaiju as an early warning system. reply IG_Semmelweiss 14 hours agorootparentOur AI startup has an LLM trained on the hollywood scripts. We are using it to determine where and when will be the next moster attack. We may still get a decent script out of these tokens... reply edward28 12 hours agorootparentIt may have been overfitted to the US though. reply vram22 7 hours agoparentprevHad not heard of the term, so googled it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju reply layer8 16 hours agoparentprevNow I’m picturing a Kaiju in https://youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ. reply hollander 17 hours agoparentprevMonster of Lochness relocated reply ethbr1 17 hours agoprevnext [2 more] [flagged] tmaly 17 hours agoparentwould be epic reply bilsbie 16 hours agoprevnext [3 more] [flagged] bhhaskin 16 hours agoparentThat does seem to be the go to these days. reply bhhaskin 16 hours agorootparentNot sure why I am being down voted... Outrage sells so media companies have a massive insensitive to push that narrative wether it's true or not. Not saying climate change isn't real or not an issue, just that it isn't the cause for every bad thing that happens in the world. If it is responsible then it should be backed up with science that supports it. reply energybored11 17 hours agoprevnext [2 more] [flagged] bryanlarsen 16 hours agoparentCarbon tax money doesn't go to the government. 90% is rebated to consumers and 10% to hospitals & schools. reply __xor_eax_eax 17 hours agoprev [–] Possible that this could explain some of the recent unexplained ocean warming? reply 0xB31B1B 17 hours agoparentThe ocean warming is well explained. It’s the result of removing sulfur compounds from ship fuels. This change reduces could cover and increases the flux of solar radiation into the ocean causing heating. This is well agreed upon by scientists and not controversial. Cloud cover reduction is measurable and clearly visible in pre and post 2021 satellite imagery where shipping lanes have cloud trails before the change and do not have cloud trails now. reply tejohnso 16 hours agorootparentEverything I've seen indicates scientists are completely flabbergasted with this six sigma warming. For example https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/06/14/record-war... Your theory is mentioned in the article and is far from a valid, complete explanation. reply __xor_eax_eax 17 hours agorootparentprevI've heard that theory is pretty contentious. I'm certainly not an expert though reply mecsred 16 hours agorootparentActual information for those interested. https://www.nasa.gov/missions/aqua/nasa-study-finds-evidence... reply JoshTko 16 hours agorootparentI don't understand how china show nothing for the chart \"% of cloud clouds from ships. reply evandale 15 hours agorootparentProbably no data. China will not make data publically available if it makes them look bad. reply boomboomsubban 15 hours agorootparentHow would they stop data from being collected by NASA satellites? reply boomboomsubban 15 hours agorootparentprevPresumably for the same reason the Gulf of Mexico doesn't show up despite having six of the ten largest US ports. I'd guess they only tracked the open ocean, but whether that's a design decision or those types of clouds don't form over certain bodies of water I couldn't say. Either way, much of the traffic in the Pacific comes from or ends at China, I don't think anyone is denying that. reply uoaei 16 hours agorootparentprevSo the change in regulation happened in 2020. How then does this hypothesis explain changes in ocean temperature before then? What is the relative magnitude of the correction vs CO2-only-based models? reply mecsred 16 hours agorootparentIt doesn't. This model isn't an alternative to CO2 based atmospheric warming models, it just explains a very recent trend in ocean temperature. This branched off a discussion about recent temperature trends. Everyone asking questions about general long term trends either aren't reading or are starting a different conversation. reply uoaei 15 hours agorootparentGP explicitly referenced this phenomenon in an unqualified manner when addressing ocean warming. If they wanted to be understood the first time, they should have clarified the context. reply btilly 14 hours agorootparentIf you check, the GP said \"the recent unexplained warming\". That's sufficient qualification to say that this is the explanation. Of course the sudden recent spike is on top of an existing warming trend. And that trends is due to long-term trends from CO2. reply uoaei 5 hours agorootparent\"recent\" is enough of a weasel word that context is still needed. reply Scarblac 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy would the extraordinary heating effect start in March 2023 then? reply chucksta 15 hours agorootparentNorth America is done going through most of its winter phase reply groby_b 15 hours agorootparentAh yes, global ocean temperatures are famously tied to winter on a single continent. reply btilly 14 hours agorootparentShip tracks are concentrated to an from that continent. So the effect of the clearing of those tracks was concentrated on those oceans. The fact that they could warm more easily than expected, only mattered when they started to warm. And then a sufficient area warmed sufficiently quickly to impact global ocean temperatures. That's the problem with snarky dismissals like the one that you just gave. Often they are missing some important point that will move the think you are ridiculing from ridiculous, to surprisingly reasonable. And if that happens, you're the one who looks bad. As an alternative, I would suggest curiosity questions. If there is no good answer, your point is still made. And if there is one, you will still look good. The only disadvantage is that you don't get the pleasure of that \"gotcha\" moment. reply organsnyder 17 hours agorootparentprevHow did the ocean stay cool before steamships were invented? reply eptcyka 17 hours agorootparentThere was less CO2 in the atmosphere, which increased its capacity to cool off the oceans. reply Kuinox 17 hours agorootparentprevThere was less CO2 in the air. reply samatman 15 hours agorootparentprevWe don't know that they did. It takes satellites to get a representative measure of ocean temperatures worldwide. There's some noisy data from ships dipping mercury thermometers into the oceans, but this was hardly a widespread practice. reply energybored11 17 hours agorootparentprevThey did not. reply organsnyder 17 hours agoparentprevThe warming isn't localized—or even more prevalent—in that area. reply __xor_eax_eax 16 hours agorootparentHmm. Yea, you would expect to see localized warming I imagine reply tejohnso 16 hours agoparentprevWe are increasing the energy imbalance in the earth system. A large part of that energy is absorbed by oceans. And at the same time our temperature buffers like the arctic sea ice, are disappearing. I think we're seeing the same thing that is always seen when a complex system is sufficiently perturbed. Loss of stability, chaotic behaviour, and eventual collapse. reply sourthyme 17 hours agoparentprev [–] I thought this was explained by excess greenhouse gases. Ref: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/.... reply __xor_eax_eax 16 hours agorootparent [–] Over the long-term, yes. But the very recent, very acute 1.5 degree warming is unexpected against pure CO2-based models. I've read a bunch of theories (reduction in certain type of emissions from ships being a prevalent one), but nothing conclusive reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
