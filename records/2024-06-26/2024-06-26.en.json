    "originBody": "Ball It's a little ball that lives in your dock. You can drag it and it'll bounce around the screen. You can also swipe on it with two fingers. It comes in red. You can flick it, bounce it, try to make it hit the corner, see how many times it can bounce, count how many times it hits the wall, and more. It's a ball. It's fun. It's a ball. Download in Releases Credits It's inspired by Nate Heagy's widget for the OS X Dashboard, which I remember fondly because someone put it on our class eMac in fifth grade. It was a lot bouncier and come in more colors, but it didn't go in the dock! Credit also goes to Wessley Roche, who made this little Gist explaining how to get the position of the dock. I've extended this to try to estimate the position of the app's dock icon when it's clicked, so the ball can animate out of it. Final words I hope you enjoy this little ball.",

Only very minor downtime, and we’ve received a lot of communication from our customers about it, they like it quite a bit. So that’s been nice. reply toddmorey 5 hours agoparentThis has been a complete show stopper for my organization: https://github.com/nate-parrott/ball/issues/10 We've submitted numerous GH issues and even tried to chase the developer down on LinkedIn.

Screensaver? She climbed onto the window's edges -that were open on your windows screen, rolled, jumped, etc. Sometimes made a comment about you not having cleaned up your desktop. It was a small executable, than ran with or without sound. It wasn't very random, but it made for an interactive mind distraction on a rough day. She also walked across the bottom of the screen, out to the right (eg), then you would hear her walking, and eventually she would show up on your left of the screen. Fun little thing with no particular purpose. reply hnlmorg 11 hours agoparentThere was a few programs like this. The earliest one I recall was Neko https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software) But I think there were sheep, dancing babies (ugh!!), something like Bonzi Buddy rings a bell (I once had to clean something named that off a colleague’s workstation when he reported it thinking it was malware). There was also toys like this on Linux and Unix too. Most famously xeyes. I miss the playful era when things like this and novelty screensavers were “cool”. reply praseodym 11 hours agorootparentBonzi Buddy was widely classified as spyware: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BonziBuddy But if you read the description of its spyware behaviour from a current perspective, it's not that different from the telemetry that’s implemented everywhere and Windows bugging you to use Bing as a search engine. reply Gormo 6 hours agorootparentYes, Bonzi Buddy was spyware.

Can't remember its name, but for example in the late 90s/early 00s I ran across an extension that gave dragged icons gravity and momentum, allowing the user to \"throw\" them around their desktop. No practical purpose, just fun. Arguably the Kaleidoscope fits into this category too. While there were tame themes for it that did more tame things like make your Mac look like Windows/BeOS/NeXTSTEP/etc, many third party Kaleidoscope schemes skewed more whacky and fun than your average theme software.

I'm not sure it has those anymore, but the problem is that people's desktops are always covered-up with windows, so those things aren't very helpful. It would be nice to have a taskbar calendar with appointments and notifications though. But Microsoft will never make something that is both pluggable and simple here.

I've played with it in emulators and it's pretty fun. I love early attempts at making programming accessible to people. To a much lesser extent, I feel like Flash (the animation program, not the player) kind of gave me that feeling the first time I used it. Flash was so immediately approachable compared to trying to figure out something like C++ with OpenGL or SDL or something, and it was just downright fun to create things with it. I've really not found anything since Flash that I've had as much fun developing in. Gamemaker is cool and still pretty fun, but I still don't feel like it's quite as streamlined and it doesn't give me the same \"anything is possible\" feeling Flash did. Maybe I'm just getting old. reply jimbokun 4 hours agoparentI still believe HyperCard is the most productive development environment for end user applications ever made. reply bergfest 11 hours agoparentprevAnd then there was Macromedia Director.

When I discovered Flash I was a literal child (12 years old), so it's not like I was reading license agreements regardless, but even if I were an adult, I could still enjoy the software simply because it's fun to use. I certainly don't have many nice things to say about Adobe as a company, I hate that they moved to a subscription model, and I hate that they didn't open source Flash Player, guaranteeing an expiration date on the tech, but that really doesn't detract from how much I really enjoyed using the software. reply akira2501 8 hours agorootparentprevWell thankfully the market has moved _well_ past that point. :| reply immibis 3 hours agorootparentWe still use Chrome, don't we? reply robertlagrant 3 hours agorootparentprevWhere is the rent-seeking happening? reply fragmede 1 hour agorootparentCharging for Photoshop as a SaaS product reply robertlagrant 59 minutes agorootparentOkay, but where's the rent seeking? reply Cthulhu_ 8 hours agorootparentprevThere's a few causes I'd posit. We've gone through a number of tools now, and they all seem finite. We don't have time to just noodle around anymore. We have loads of other things to play with as well. And of course, life, obligations, etc; time is a rare commodity and you want to spend it on something you know you'll enjoy. That said, last time I spent some time on just playing with software was with the Pico-8 virtual console and its intentionally constrained development tooling. reply tombert 3 hours agorootparentI will admit that Pico 8 is probably the most fun dev environment I've found since Flash. It doesn't give me the same \"anything is possible\" feeling Flash did, but that might just be because I'm more jaded and not a child anymore (as my quickly receding hairline keeps reminding me of!). I do think that Flash was more fun for me just because it was \"animation-first\", instead of \"programming first\". It felt like I could easily make \"real\" cartoons, and then make a game out of it, instead of trying to bolt on a bunch of PNGs into a gaming framework. I know it wasn't for everyone, but for a kid like me, it was kind of magic. reply xattt 5 hours agorootparentprevTangent, but was the difference between Shockwave, Flash and Shockwave Flash?

Flash was downright fun indeed! reply tombert 3 hours agorootparentYeah, P5 and Processing are cool, I like them, but the part of Flash was so magical was that I sort of discovered the coding part. I pirated a copy of Flash so I could draw dumb animations, I would then convert looping animations into movie clips, and then I sort of accidentally figured out that you can attach code to those movie clips, and then I figured out how to make basic games. None of my games were that impressive, but it was ridiculously fun for me. I like P5, I've played with it, but the integration with the animation tool is what really made me love Flash. I miss it. reply rchaud 5 hours agorootparentprevWhile these libraries are great, doing anything with them requires writing code.

When Flash went away, it was very clear to me that if HTML5 at that time was the future and it's immediate replacement, we were screwed. If you're looking for something that could build next, Flutter seems to be carrying on the promise of one codebase to run on everything similar to Flash. The other techs that I'm bullish on and are still developing are WebAssembly, and to some degree Rust. reply tombert 3 hours agorootparentI don't think that P5 has direct integration with a drawing/animation tool does it? I think what I liked about Flash was that it was a drawing/animation tool first, and there were easy ways to bolt things onto the drawings and animation. It was slow and Flash player had a lot of issues, but I don't think P5 is really a direct replacement for that. reply cess11 3 hours agorootparentprev\"Flash went away faster than a replacement emerged.\" Not really how it looks to me: https://haxe.org/ reply tombert 3 hours agorootparentI feel like Haxe is more of a replacement for Flex and Flash. I like Haxe, I think it's pretty neat, but Flash was cool to me because of the animation and drawing tools that I could later add code to. Flex was cool because it gave you a more traditional framework for making Flash apps (XML-based layouts and forms and remoting stuff), but I found it only about 1/8th as fun as Flash, because it felt more like \"boring\" programming, which is still fun, just not as fun to me as drawing cartoons. reply Daub 6 hours agoprevYou all probably know this, but the way that a cursor changes to an icon of a hand when hovering over a link was directly inspired by HyperCard.

When I think about them today, I realize... they were probably HyperCard programs. There was one that was basically an interactive storybook about a black cat, that I forget the name of now but I know is on Macintosh Garden. 99% sure that one is HyperCard. My dad gave me a program called Soroban that was basically just an abacus, I think it gave you simple arithmetic problems and you'd do the calculations on the abacus to figure out the answer. He actually may have written that one himself, I'm not sure. (unfortunately I don't remember how to use an abacus today) Interested to hear about what kinds of obscure HyperCard programs you all encountered back then... reply jdlyga 15 hours agoprevHyperCard and SuperPaint were my legos as a kid. My dad is a scientist that needed a Macintosh to run calculations, so I was one of the only kids I knew who's family had a computer at the time. I built so many little contraptions using HyperCard. I have a huge fondness for black and white monitor applications and the fun little ways they created patterns using only monochrome. reply LargeWu 4 hours agoparentSimilar. My parents were teachers, and my dad had dominion of the Mac lab, even though he wasn't particularly astute with them. But, since they were idle in the summers, he was able to bring one home. First Apple IIe's, later early Mac's. I spent many, many hours screwing around in HyperCard. We also got our first computer (an Apple II GS, the precursor to Mac. With a full color monitor!) via the \"Apple for a Teacher\" program where teachers were able to buy them at a significantly discounted price. I had won a creative writing contest for 3-2-1 Contact magazine where the prize was 5 games of my choice, and I was able to convince my parents I needed a computer to play them on during the rest of the year. reply metadat 19 hours agoprevHeads up: If you click the window-maximize box in the upper right-hand corner it zooms out to the HyperCard Editor!

Nothing there, either. Oh, there is no shortage of attempts. And all of them are failures for the same reason: they insist on being more capable, more complexity-laden than HyperCard. And thus, none of them can readily substitute for it. https://www.loper-os.org/?p=568#selection-660.0-660.5 reply basch 5 hours agorootparentprevPowerPoint? Maybe PowerPoint with embedded excel? reply alexambarch 17 hours agoprevAs someone who’s too young to have been around for HyperCard, what was the main draw? Was it the accessibility of the tech or was it just really well executed? reply Paul-Craft 16 hours agoparentIt was both, really. HyperCard put the power of a GUI into your hands with simple metaphors and syntax. The language is English-like enough to feel easy to use, but not so much as to fool you into thinking it can do things it actually can't do (looking at you, Inform 7!). You'd attach code to widgets in a visual way that drove home the idea that this bit of code generated that behavior when you clicked a button, typed into a text field, etc. Oh, and, let's not forget that the HyperCard environment also implemented object persistence, which came in handy, because you wouldn't have to write file handling code, or any kind of \"save state\" functionality. Of course, you could also mess up a stack in such a way that it was hard to figure out and hard to fix due to said semantics, but, on balance, I'd say transparent object persistence was a pretty big win. And, it was literally right there if you had a Mac. After selling it briefly as a standalone product for $49.95, Apple started bundling it with every new Mac for about a decade. If your Mac came with System 6, 7, 8, or 9, you had HyperCard. It also came with the Apple IIGS during that time. (Great machine, BTW!)

If your Mac came with System 6, 7, 8, or 9, you had HyperCard The full story here is: Bill Atkinson went on an LSD trip and had the idea for HyperCard (literally according to his own account), and wrote it. He gave it to Apple in return for the promise that they would bundle it with every Macintosh for free. Eventually Apple realized that selling and giving away Macintosh software like MacWrite, MacDraw, etc, undercut their attempts at getting people to write software for the platform, so they spun off their software division as Claris, which coincided about the time of HyperCard 2.0 releasing, which became a paid Claris product. From then on, every Macintosh shipped with a copy of HyperCard Player, which just let you run stacks other people made but not author them yourself. There were ways around the Player issue though. The copy of HyperCard on our family Mac somehow had the HyperCard application from 2.0, but the Home and other stacks from HyperCard 1, leading to me always being confused with reading any documentation, it took me literally years to realize what was going on (we didn't have AOL or anything back then, all I had were two HyperCard books from my uncle) The last major update to HyperCard was in 1992, after which it was abandoned (but still sold, with no updates, for another decade) There was an effort to rebuild HyperCard as a new interactivity layer for QuickTime 3.0 so that you could build multimedia applications and host them cross-platform on the web with the QuickTime plugin. This made it to an early alpha that was demoed at WWDC. Steve Jobs came back, and hated Bill Atkinson since he was a traitor who stayed at Apple instead of going to NeXT, so killed it. reply w10-1 1 hour agorootparent> Bill Atkinson went on an LSD trip and had the idea for HyperCard There's another (to me more plausible) story.

Hypercard 2 (1990) definitely required a separate purchase (I had to talk my parents into buying it), but I think we had Hypercard 1 from being bundled with System 6.

(or at least that's what Robyn and Rand told me when I chatted with them at a MacWorld Expo around its release). Their earlier games (The Manhole, Cosmic Osmo, etc) had been much more pure-Hypercard affairs. Interestingly, for Riven (Myst's sequel) they were still using Hypercard to author the game, but the game no longer ran through Hypercard; instead, it ran on a custom C++ engine which ran on the data files output by the Hypercard authoring tools. reply kalleboo 3 hours agorootparentThe cool thing about Myst being built in HyperCard is you can just change the file type from APPL to STAK and open it up in HyperCard and mess around.

We also used it to mock user interface concepts, etc. We also made a lot of use of ResEdit which was great for creating and modifying assets such as icons, strings, bitmaps, etc. Once I got into the Mac ecosystem, it was stunning how quickly you could build sophisticated (for the time) GUIS, demos etc. It sure beat trying to build interfaces using curses on a traditional unix box and was a lot cheaper than a Sun box or a Lisp machine! reply lispm 2 hours agorootparentBtw., with the MacIvory Nubus-based Lisp Machine for the Mac, one could call Lisp on the Lisp Machine from HyperCard. reply roywiggins 17 hours agoparentprevI remember being introduced to HyperCard and the idea of linked cards- hypertext, in other words- blew my mind.

(or Basic on Atari 800xl's at home!) I remember it being called object oriented programming, and putting things together like jigsaw puzzles. reply cortesoft 14 hours agoparentprevIt is hard to separate out HyperCard from where I was in life when I was using it. It was 1991, my family had just bought a Mac LC, and I was 8 years old. I had learned BASIC from reading an old book from 1978 that a co-worker of my dad had given me when I expressed interest in computers. That same friend said I should try HyperCard. It literally changed my life. It is hard to explain to people who have grown up with the internet, but at this point my family had no internet access at all (we didn't even get a modem for a few more years) and I didn't know anyone who knew how to program. Everything was self taught from reading books that I either got from my dad's co-worker or from the library. HyperCard was so easy to learn for me as a kid. For one, it was all visual. If you wanted to add a button for someone to click, you would select \"Add Button\" and drag it to where you wanted it to be. In addition, you could learn how to do things from other HyperCard stacks by clicking on various buttons and reading what the script for those buttons did. Since I was self taught (and very young), I didn't know anything about data structures or algorithms. However, HyperCard made everything intuitive to me. To persist data, you could output it into 'fields' (which like buttons, could be created by clicking 'new field' and placing it where you wanted). While I later learned how to make these fields invisible, when I first started I would just make them really small and put them in a corner behind something else. I would then write data to them from button scripts, allowing me to persist data. Since I didn't know about data structures, I would treat everything as strings that I would store in these fields. I didn't know what an array was, so I just would create a long string of comma separated values that I would read in, act on, and then write back out to the fields. I created primitive databases by having each line of the field be a different record... I had never heard the term 'csv' at the time, but it just seemed natural to me. Debugging was easy; I could just expand the fields into my visible view to see what was being written to them. Things being 'object oriented' was very natural, since everything in HyperCard is a visual object you can interact with. I learned SO MUCH hacking around with HyperCard. It made me love programming, and it was so much fun. I didn't even realize how much I was learning until much later in life; I avoided majoring in computer science because I feared ruining my favorite hobby if I pursued it as a career. Later (after not finding an alternative to pursue after graduating college) I decided to give software development a try, and I realized how much I already knew just from HyperCard. Event driven architectures just made sense, because that is how HyperCard always worked. I had a pretty good grasp of data structures because I had created them visually as I needed them, without realizing what I was doing. 33 years later, I still get a thrill from programming that HyperCard instilled in me. So yeah, HyperCard changed my life. reply whartung 12 hours agorootparentIt’s funny, the graphic nature of Hypercard is what put me off of it. It was essentially MacPaint with a few controls and a scripting language. While fundamentally it was persistent cards with fields, buttons, and actions, as presented with the assorted demos, it was graphically rich. And myself, I am not graphically rich. Hardly. I find it intimidating. I find the web intimidating for the same reason. I really struggle trying to make a web page, even with a zillion templates. For whatever reason, it’s very hard for me. It’s a cool system. It was a bit hamstrung later on by being trapped with its original card size. Even as screens got larger. reply cortesoft 12 hours agorootparentI am usually the same way, and have zero graphic design sense. HyperCard never felt like it does designing a web page... i just placed buttons wherever, and they were never properly lined up in my stacks. All slightly different sizes, not aligned, horrible UI choices all over the place... but I never really concerned myself about it because I very rarely shared my projects. They were for myself. reply atribecalledqst 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I could never do serious front-end work, I just can't do (and also don't enjoy) making anything graphical. That said I have made a couple web apps for personal & work use (and I have a Neocities) and it is certainly a freeing experience to write them without giving a crap about aesthetics or design. I get the job done, it's not pretty, but once the functionality's there I'm happy.

What is the modern day tool that achieves the same thing as HyperCard back then? Is it html/javascript? reply matthewn 17 hours agoparentI would say that HTML/Javascript is not a \"tool\" in the same sense that HyperCard was. HyperCard's real strength was that it allowed mere users (not programmers) to create their own apps (or \"stacks\", in the HyperCard parlance) through pointing and clicking, plus an English-like scripting language (HyperTalk). We have largely abandoned the idea that users should be able to create their own apps, so there is no popular, modern analogue to HyperCard, though some people keep trying. For instance, LiveCode is a commercial product that is directly inspired by HyperCard. And CardStock is an open source HyperCard clone that swaps out something English-like for Python as the underlying scripting language. https://livecode.com/ https://github.com/benjie-git/CardStock reply scroot 1 hour agoparentprevMy take is that there is no such thing. This is not because there aren't tools now that do \"similar things\" to what HyperCard did, but there is simply no longer a personal computing environment in which such a tool fits so instrumentally and seamlessly. HyperCard came about in an era where personal computer users were still being inculcated into what using a computer even meant. That was the moment to let end-user programming and malleable systems like HyperCard take over. (A somewhat similar thing might be said of OpenDoc, but that's a bit different) From a corporate perspective, what even was HyperCard? A way computer users could just make their own basic applications? How do you continuously make money? What about your computer's dev community? Because of these and other commercial concerns, both the way users today engage with personal computing _and_ the tools we have to manipulate our computing environments are strongly determined by a consumption model -- and there exists a strong bifurcation between users and programmers. We have no true HyperCard equivalent today because personal computing went in a different direction. reply dfabulich 16 hours agoparentprevA lot of people have asked this question. There are a bunch of simple GUI-builder tools, including GUI builders for the web, but none of them are popular, due to the sweet spot of supply and demand that Hypercard hit. When Hypercard launched, it came with every Mac, it was free, and there was nothing else like it available on the Mac. On the Mac, the alternative to Hypercard was to layout UI widgets in code, with no GUI builder at all, or eventually to pay $$$ for a professional-grade IDE like CodeWarrior. As an entry-level user with no budget, if you wanted a GUI builder for the Mac, you got Hypercard, or nothing. This created a community of Hypercard enthusiasts. Furthermore, when Hypercard launched, Macs had a standard screen resolution. Every Mac sold had a screen resolution of 512x342 pixels, so you could know for sure how your cards would look on any Mac. Supporting resizable GUIs is one of the hardest things to do in any GUI builder. (How should the buttons layout when the screen gets very small, like a phone? Or very wide, like a 16:9 monitor?) Today, Xcode uses a sophisticated constraint solver / theorem prover to allow developers to build resizable UIs in a GUI; it works pretty well, I think, but it's never going to be as easy to learn as \"drag the button onto the screen and it's going to look exactly like that everywhere.\" The last issue is the real killer for modern Hypercard wannabes: it's a small step from a web GUI builder to raw HTML/CSS. You don't have to pay big bucks to have access to professional-grade HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sure, they're not that easy to learn, but you can teach a kid to write interactive web pages, no problem. As a result, the demand for a simple GUI builder is lower than it was for Hypercard, and even when you do capture a user, they tend to outgrow your product, and there are a zillion competitors, so none of them can build a community with real traction. reply tangentstorm 15 hours agoparentprevFor one: https://internet-janitor.itch.io/decker It even looks a bit like Hypercard, by default (it's lo-fi, but there are colors under the hood). reply tunaoftheland 4 hours agorootparentAgreed, Decker has that right feel to it to be a good reimplementation of HyperCard.

Let's fix this. QuickLook headers If we want to mess with how QuickLook displays things, we need to get at its window. Then we can hopefully poke around in the views and change how they draw. The QuickLook API is public and documented, and if you look through the docs you'll see that this window is called QLPreviewPanel, there's one instance of it per app, and you retrieve it with [QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel]. Debugging Finder I'd only ever used QuickLook from Finder, so that was where I thought to start. Let's bust out the debugger and see what Finder's up to: $ lldb -n Finder error: process exited with status -1 (attach failed (Not allowed to attach to process.)) Actually, first, let's deal with SIP. SIP is a new Apple technology that helps you out by stopping you from reading and writing memory on your own computer. In order to fix problems in system processes like this, we have to turn it off and reboot. Alright, let's try that again: $ lldb -n Finder Process 4040 stopped thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = signal SIGSTOP frame #0: 0x000000018df1bf54 libsystem_kernel.dylib`mach_msg2_trap + 8 libsystem_kernel.dylib`mach_msg2_trap: -> 0x18df1bf54 : ret libsystem_kernel.dylib`macx_swapon: 0x18df1bf58 : mov x16, #-0x30 0x18df1bf5c : svc #0x80 0x18df1bf60 : ret Target 0: (Finder) stopped. Executable module set to \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\". Architecture set to: arm64e-apple-macosx-. We're in to our own machine. Let's try setting a breakpoint on sharedPreviewPanel. (lldb) break set -n sharedPreviewPanel Breakpoint 5: where = QuickLookUI`+[QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel], address = 0x00000001f81c025c (lldb) c Navigate to an image file, press space, and: Process 4040 stopped thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 5.1 frame #0: 0x00000001f81c025c QuickLookUI`+[QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel] QuickLookUI`+[QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel]: -> 0x1f81c025c : pacibsp 0x1f81c0260 : sub sp, sp, #0x40 0x1f81c0264 : stp x22, x21, [sp, #0x10] 0x1f81c0268 : stp x20, x19, [sp, #0x20] LLDB has stopped the Finder process in the sharedPreviewPanel function.

We can probably ignore QPreviewTitleBarView and its children, so let's focus on the other branch of the tree. There's a QLPreviewBackgroundView, then a bunch of NSViews, and then a QLPanelPreviewView, a QLPreviewContainerView, and right at the very top, an NSRemoteView. NSRemote­View I haven't come across NSRemoteView before and I'm not really sure what it is. There doesn't seem to be a public header for it. I wonder how it works? Well, we might be getting ahead of ourselves here. We still don't know if the NSRemoteView has anything to do with our image. Let's hide it and see if our image disappears. (lldb) po [(NSRemoteView *)0x119c3a040 setHidden:YES] (lldb) c Indeed it does. So it's this NSRemoteView that's actually displaying our image. The “remote” makes me think it's communicating with another process which is doing the actual rendering, so we'll probably have to look inside the remote process to see what it's doing. But which process is that? Perhaps the NSRemoteView can tell us? Let's see what it can do: (lldb) po [[NSRemoteView class] fp_shortMethodDescription] : in NSRemoteView: Class Methods: + (void) initialize; (0xd465800195a3a894) + (void) observeValueForKeyPath:(id)arg1 ofObject:(id)arg2 change:(id)arg3 context:(void*)arg4; (0xea63800195a944bc) + (id) _findFirstKeyViewInDirection:(unsigned long)arg1 forKeyLoopGroupingView:(id)arg2; (0x3679000195a95140) + (BOOL) automaticallyNotifiesObserversOfTouchBar; (0xc10a800195ad0774) + (const __CFString*) privateRunLoopMode; (0x7101800195a95148) + (CGColor*) _warningColorCG; (0x2119800195aadb38) + (void) initAll; (0x932a000195a3ad40) + (id) _warningColorNS; (0x7d7d000195aadbbc) + (BOOL) _appModalSessionWouldBeSafe:(BOOL)arg1; (0x9c39800195a9b638) + (id) _remoteViewForIdentifier:(id)arg1; (0xda2a800195a94dc4) + (BOOL) allowSetObjectForKey:(id)arg1 bridge:(id)arg2 bridgePhase:(unsigned char)arg3 withReply:(^block)arg4; (0x6272000195aa1b44) + (BOOL) anyRemoteViewAttachedToWindow:(id)arg1; (0x285f800195a94c14) + (void) deferBlockOntoMainThread:(^block)arg1; (0xe1c800195a9514c) + (BOOL) isFakeEvent:(id)arg1; (0x4b56800195ab2860) + (id) remoteViewsAttachedToWindow:(id)arg1; (0xe551800195a94a14) + (void) rendezvousWindow:(unsigned char)arg1 kind:(unsigned char)arg2 spawnedBy:(id)arg3 styleMask:(unsigned long)arg4 contentRect:(CGRect)arg5 identifier:(id)arg6 listenerEndpoint:(id)arg7 completion:(^block)arg8; (0x8501800195aa4da0) + (Class) rendezvousWindowClass:(Class)arg1; (0x6316800195a99d48) Properties: @property (retain, nonatomic) NSAccessibilityRemoteUIElement* accessoryViewAccessibilityParent; @property (readonly, nonatomic) NSRemoteView* spawnedBy; @property (readonly) CGPoint requestedOrigin; @property (readonly) BOOL _isAssociated; @property NSObject* delegate; @property (retain) NSView* accessoryView; @property (readonly) BOOL isValid; @property (copy, nonatomic) NSString* serviceName; @property (retain, nonatomic) NSUUID* serviceInstanceIdentifier; (@synthesize serviceInstanceIdentifier = _serviceInstanceIdentifier;) @property (copy, nonatomic) NSString* serviceSubclassName; @property (readonly) unsigned long hash; @property (readonly) Class superclass; @property (readonly, copy) NSString* description; @property (readonly, copy) NSString* debugDescription; @property (readonly, nonatomic) NSXPCInterface* auxiliaryInterfaceOutgoing; @property (readonly, nonatomic) NSXPCInterface* auxiliaryInterfaceIncoming; @property (weak) NSXPCConnection* auxiliaryServiceConnection; (@synthesize auxiliaryServiceConnection = auxiliaryServiceConnection;) @property (readonly) BOOL wantsAlertStylePadding; Instance Methods: - (oneway void) release; (0xc97d800195a40a60) - (void) dealloc; (0x715b800195a94fa0) - (id) description; (0x1b2e000195a94710) - (id) retain; (0x3811000195a3ff68) - (BOOL) isValid; (0xc844800195a413e0) - (void) .cxx_destruct; (0x7560800195ab293c) - (void) _setDelegate:(id)arg1; (0xc37a800195a3feac) - (id) delegate; (0x1a7c800195a3fb64) [...hundreds and hundreds of methods...] A lot! Searching for “process” in that list of methods yields _serviceProcessIdentifier so let's call it. (lldb) po [$v _serviceProcessIdentifier] 5959 What's that process? $ ps -c 5959 PID TTY TIME CMD 5959 ?? 0:14.34 QuickLookUIService This has to be it. Debugging Finder isn't what we want.

So, the other side of that NSRemoteView is... somewhere... in this process. If we could iterate through all the views in the process, we could see if any of them looked like the other end of an NSRemoteViewDelegate. I searched the internet for a function that would get all views, but I couldn't find anything except for the odd person saying to just use Xcode.1 Well, why don't we just use Xcode? After opening Xcode, creating a project, choosing where to save the project, entering a team name, choosing a template, entering a bundle identifier, creating a scheme, and setting the scheme target so it'll let me use the debugger, I attached it to QuickLookUIService, pressed “Show View Hierarchy”, and: Xcode's view debugger attached to QuickLookUIService. Well, that was easy! We can click through these views and get info about them, including their addresses so we can mess with them in the debugger. And we can see straight away that the frontmost view, which Xcode tells us is a QLBorderView, is a border with rounded corners! Wait, there's a border? The Border There is. I hadn't noticed it at first, but if you zoom in, you can see that as well as rounding the corners, QuickLook also superimposes a slightly-too-small border: The QLBorderView turns out to be very simple; it's just a view whose layer has a borderWidth and a borderColor. Let's get its address from Xcode and tell it to cut it out: (lldb) po [0x600000850180 setBorderWidth:0]; Border successfully removed! Unclipping So, the border is gone, but the corners are still rounded. We can see in the view debugger that the image view's corners are not rounded, so something must be clipping it. Let's have a look through all of the parent views' layers and see if any of them have a nonzero cornerRadius. You could probably write some code to do this but I just clicked through each one and copied its layer's address into the debugger to check: (lldb) p [(CALayer *)0x60000283f5a0 cornerRadius] (double) $78 = 0 (lldb) p [(CALayer *)0x60000283f660 cornerRadius] (double) $79 = 0.43438914027149322 Well, that didn't take long. Let's try... (lldb) po [0x60000283f660 setMasksToBounds:0] (lldb) po [0x60000283f660 setNeedsDisplay] Corners restored! Keeping it that way So, we've now fixed our view. We can see all of our pixels. But we're not done yet, because when you click on a different file, you get a new view, and the new view is rounded. It looks like QL creates one view per previewed file, and reuses the old view only for the same file. So, we need to intercept it when it makes new views and stop it from screwing them up. Let's start with that border view. When is it created? We'll break on its init method, which its method list tells us is initWithFrame:. (lldb) break set -n '[QLOverlayBorderView initWithFrame:]' (lldb) c This does indeed trigger when you select a new image: Process 5959 stopped thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1 frame #0: 0x00000001f827c7fc QuickLookUI`-[QLOverlayBorderView initWithFrame:] QuickLookUI`-[QLOverlayBorderView initWithFrame:]: -> 0x1f827c7fc : pacibsp 0x1f827c800 : sub sp, sp, #0x30 0x1f827c804 : stp x20, x19, [sp, #0x10] 0x1f827c808 : stp x29, x30, [sp, #0x20] Target 0: (QuickLookUIService) stopped.

The border view is being called from something called enableBorder. What if we disabled enableBorder? There are no docs for the QLDisplayBundleViewController, of course, but there's always a method list: (lldb) po [$x0 fp_shortMethodDescription] : in QLImageDisplayBundleViewController: Properties: @property (readonly) IKImageView2* imageView; Instance Methods: - (id) imageView; (0xf978000106a02cf8) - (BOOL) _epsilonEqualRect:(CGRect)arg1 toRect:(CGRect)arg2; (0x8f22800106a02d50) - (BOOL) useLayerMaskForCorners; (0xe439000106a02dbc) - (void) updateContentCornerRadius; (0x582e800106a02e8c) - (void) didSave:(BOOL)arg1 toURL:(id)arg2 forClosing:(BOOL)arg3; (0xf67c000106a02e90) - (void) enableBorder; (0x7b35800106a02f2c) - (void) disableBorder; (0x9d21800106a02f90) - (void) teardownMarkup:(long)arg1 needsSave:(BOOL*)arg2; (0xe96b000106a02ff4) - (BOOL) mustHandleDragAtLocation:(CGPoint)arg1; (0xdc49800106a0305c) - (BOOL) mustHandleDoubleClickAtLocation:(CGPoint)arg1; (0xb042800106a030b0) - (void) copy:(id)arg1; (0x325c800106a03140) - (void) selectAll:(id)arg1; (0xb532800106a031a4) (QLDisplayBundleViewController ...) As well as enableBorder, there's a disableBorder. If we're lucky it might disable the border. (lldb) po [$x0 disableBorder] It does! So, to fix our QuickLook process, we'll have to arrange for disableBorder to be called instead of enableBorder.2 Now, what about the rounded corners? We can set a breakpoint to see where the corners get rounded: (lldb) break set -n 'setCornerRadius:' -c '$x0 == 0x600002cbd830 && $d0 != 0.0' When this breakpoint is hit, we can see that it's being called from a method called updateCornerRadius. So, our strategy for making our fix persist will be to: Patch updateCornerRadius to return immediately without doing anything. Patch enableBorder to just call disableBorder and return. Aside: Method Swizzling In Objective-C, classes have methods and methods have implementations. As a holdover from the bicycle-for-the-mind days, the Objective-C runtime is hacker-friendly and provides functions to help us monkey around with things: Method class_getInstanceMethod(Class, SEL); IMP class_getMethodImplementation(Class, SEL); IMP method_getImplementation(Method); IMP method_setImplementation(Method, IMP); void method_exchangeImplementations(Method, Method); In theory, you should be able to use these functions to switch out the implementations of enableBorder and updateCornerRadius. But, try as I might, I couldn't get it to work reliably. Maybe I was holding it wrong, but instead of spending time figuring out why, I just went straight to no-nonsense instruction patching. Patching the corner radius Let's patch updateCornerRadius to return immediately without doing anything. We'll write a ret instruction over the first instruction in the function. As documented in this 76MB PDF, the encoding of ret in ARM64 is 0xd65f03c0. We can write a simple Python script that will find the function in memory and patch it: (lldb) script x, = lldb.target.FindSymbols('-[IKImageContentView updateCornerRadius]') e = lldb.SBError() lldb.process.WriteMemory( x.symbol.addr.load_addr, struct.pack(' 0x1c3ec9a60 : ret 0x1c3ec9a64 : stp d9, d8, [sp, #-0x30]! 0x1c3ec9a68 : stp x20, x19, [sp, #0x10] 0x1c3ec9a6c : stp x29, x30, [sp, #0x20] Success! Patching enableBorder Patching enableBorder is a little tricker, since we don't just want to have it ret, we want to have it jump to disableBorder. The ARM64 instruction for performing an unconditional jump is b, and is encoded as follows: The instruction is 4 bytes long, like all ARM64 instructions. The high 6 bits are 00101. The low 26 bits are the number of instructions to jump, relative to the current instruction. Each instruction is 4 bytes, so we just need to subtract the destination address from the source address, sign-extend to 26 bits, and set the high 6 bits to 00101. Here's the Python code to do that: (lldb) script def get_symbol_address(name): symbol_context, = lldb.target.FindSymbols(name) return symbol_context.symbol.addr.load_addr enableBorder = get_symbol_address('-[QLDisplayBundleViewController enableBorder]') disableBorder = get_symbol_address('-[QLDisplayBundleViewController disableBorder]') jump_offset_bytes = disableBorder - enableBorder jump_offset_insns = jump_offset_bytes // 4 def sign_extend(val, nbits): return (val + (1 : b 0x20b23f164 ; -[QLDisplayBundleViewController disableBorder] 0x20b23ed64 : stp d15, d14, [sp, #-0x90]! 0x20b23ed68 : stp d13, d12, [sp, #0x10] 0x20b23ed6c : stp d11, d10, [sp, #0x20] Nice! 3 Putting it all together We now have all the building blocks we need to make a nice script that attaches to all running QuickLook processes and patches them. This article is long enough already, so instead of reproducing it here I'll just link to the repo. That way you'll get any fixes that have been made since I wrote this article, too. You can find the latest version of the script here. Conclusion I am reminded of the words of the late, great Douglas Adams: The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair. Well, perhaps not impossible. But that was rather involved! The bit where I try and sell you something Thanks for reading.

    "originBody": "June 25, 2024 A brief introduction to interval arithmetic Why x^2 isn't always x*x. You've got a wall in your apartment and a couch. You measure the wall with a ruler and get 7 feet, then you measure the couch and get 7 feet. Can you fit the couch against that wall? Maybe. If the two measure is exactly 7 feet than sure, 7 ≤ 7. But you probably didn't line your measuring stick up perfectly with the couch, and also the stick itself might be a tiny bit long. There's some uncertainty around the edges, say 1/10th of a foot. Instead of treating each as exactly 7 feet, we can instead say that each is somewhere between a minimum of 6.9 feet and a maximum of 7.1. We can write this as an interval (6.9, 7.1). From there, we can say interval (a, b) is \"definitely less than\" another interval (c, d) if b >> x = 0.3 >>> x + 0.00000000000000001 0.3 >>> x + 0.00000000000000002 0.3 >>> x + 0.00000000000000003 0.30000000000000004 If a (double precision) floating point calculation lands in the interval (0.3 - 3e-17, 0.3 + 3e-17), it's collapsed to the value 0.3. This has lead to some proposals to use interval arithmetic instead of floating point. An interval may be less precise than a single FP number, but it will be more accurate: you won't have an exact number but you'll know that the correct number is somewhere in the bounds. While a bunch of FP computations will always give you an exact number, but it could be very far from the actual answer. These proposals have been around as long as floating point. The father of the IEEE-754 standard, William Kahan, wrote an essay about why interval arithmetic can't replace FP. His argument comes back to overestimation: in most computations, interval boundaries grow too big to be useful. He wrote that back in 2006. Since then, there's been one big new interval arithmetic proposal: John Gutafson's universal numbers. I think his posit version isn't intervals but I'm not sure? This is well outside of the my area of expertise. I can tell, though, that Gustafson and Kahan hate each other. That's the main connection between intervals and computer science. Of course, there are also particular domains where intervals are really important, such as in manufacturing tolerances. Logic for Programmers update 14k words!

However, the introduction says >Instead of treating each as exactly 7 feet, we can instead say that each is somewhere between a minimum of 6.9 feet and a maximum of 7.1. We can write this as an interval (6.9, 7.1). Yes we can use an interval to express an uncertainty. However, uncertainties in physical measurements are a little bit more complicated. When I measure something to be 7 plus minus 0.1 feet, what I am saying is that the value of the measured variable is not known for sure. It can be represented by a bell curve centred on 7 and 95% of the area under the curve (95% probability) that the true value lies between 6.9 and 7.1. The value of the measured variable is much more likely to be 7 than 6.9. There is also a small chance that the value lies outside of the 6.9 to 7.1 range. In an interval, there is no probability distribution. It is more like an infinite list of numbers. In practice, interval arithmetic is seldom used for uncertainty analysis for scientific experiments. reply notrealyme123 1 hour agoparentTo close the loop: The connection is called an alpha-cut.

The interval on the support is how you connect propability and intervals. reply klysm 1 hour agoparentprevGaussian distributions are a horrible choice for representing measurement uncertainty. If the tool is properly calibrated, 100% of the probability mass will be within (6.9, 7.1). A normal distribution would have probability mass in negative numbers!

Nothing in it is incorrect. It's also not really a meaningful critique or response to the article. The article did not attempt to describe \"uncertainty analysis for scientific experiments\". It blatantly began by describing interval arithmetic and ended by justifying it as being meaningful in two contexts: IEEE floating point numbers and machining tolerances. Neither are experimental domains and both do have a meaningful inbuilt notion of interval that would be not be served by treating intervals as gaussians. reply PeterisP 9 hours agoparentprevWhat I hear is that similar techniques should/could be used by explicitly modeling it not as an interval (6.9, 7.1) but as a gaussian distribution of 7±0.1, and a computer can do the arithmetic to see what the final distribution is after a set of calculations. reply adammarples 6 hours agoparentprevThere is no reason to assume a normal distribution. If you have a tool that measures to a precision of 2 decimal places, you have no information about what the distribution of the third decimal place might be. reply samatman 3 hours agorootparentThis is correct, which is why intervals don't choose an interpretation of the region of uncertainty. If you do have reason to interpret the uncertainty as normally distributed, you can use that interpretation to narrow operations on two intervals based on your acceptable probability of being wrong. But if the interval might represent, for example, an unknown but systematic bias, then this would be a mistake. You'd want to use other methods to determine that bias if you can, and correct for it. reply klysm 1 hour agorootparentprevI'm not sure why you are being downvoted - this is absolutely true. reply empath75 5 hours agorootparentprev> There is no reason to assume a normal distribution.

In ClickHouse, interval arithmetic is applied to index analysis. A sparse index consists of granules, and each granule is an interval of tuples in lexicographic order. This interval is decomposed into a union of hyperrectangles. Conditions such as comparisons, logic operators, and many other functions are evaluated on these hyperrectangles, yielding boolean intervals. Boolean intervals represent ternary logic (always true, always false, can be true or false). Interesting tricks include: applying functions that are monotonic on ranges (for example, the function \"day of month\" is monotonic as long as the month does not change), calculating function preimages on intervals, and even calculating preimages of n-ary functions, which is useful for space-filling curves, such as Morton or Hilbert curves.

Would be interesting to get more bench (speed / memory) comparing float with unum. reply jcranmer 12 minutes agorootparentI've been aware about the unum stuff for a while, but I've never delved deeply into it, and some of my hot takes on it: * Gustafson's unum project seems to be invariably pitched in a cult-like this-is-the-one-true-way [1] manner which makes it hard to evaluate dispassionately. * There seem to be several versions of unums, the latest of which is not-even-a-unum anymore but instead a regular floating-point number with different distribution called 'posits.' That Gustafson seems to have changed the vision so many times suggests to me that early criticisms were in fact correct. * Conversations I've had with numerical experts about interval arithmetic is that it generally doesn't work [as a replacement for where we use floating-point today]--intervals tend to blow up to infinity, especially as it's difficult to account for correlated error (which is the point of this article here, actually). A lot of Gustafson's pitch seems to be \"you shouldn't need a numerical analyst to write math,\" which is naturally going to rile up a numerical analyst (like Kahan). But the numerical analyst's retort that you're still liable to get into trouble if you're not savvy enough to know the pitfalls is equally true of Gustafson's proposal; there's no magic bullet that makes problems go away. From my perspective, the real problem is that we lack the tooling to let programmers discover issues with their numerics code, no matter how they're implemented. Gustafson and Kahan are talking past each other on this problem, with Kahan rightly pointing to all the functionality that IEEE 754 added to enable this functionality, and Gustafson rightly pointing out that those features are unused and largely unusable, and Kahan (probably rightly) pointing out that unums' promise of a magic bullet to numerics comes with issues of its own. [1] This is possibly meant just as a joke, but it's the kind of unfunny joke that instead makes me wonder about the character of the person who presents it, like how asshole-as-a-character internet personalities turn out to frequently also be assholes in person. reply fuzzfactor 2 hours agorootparentprevIn 1980 I started working with a straightforward algorithm that was computerized then by agreeing on its implementation in a few pages of 32-bit double-precision floating-point Fortran code. Up until then, aggregate data had been manually compiled and published in kilos of handbooks over the decades. This was the first acceptable computer approach since it was the exact same pre-1980 algorithm, and expected to play a part in correct 20-digit decimal billable amounts based on computer data which had been meticulously rounded to 4 decimal places, which is what took up most of the Fortran code. Well, I needed to do the same calculations on an 8-bit Radio Shack Pocket Computer. And there was only 512 bytes of user space for my TRS-80 Basic code. The exact algorithm would fit, but not any of the standard multi-step rounding procedure. The floating point output was not often good to 4 decimal places. Massaged it iteratively until the algorithm was no longer fully recognizable. Still no good. Changed from floats to integers. This also saved more memory for workspace. I was no mathematician, and in order to get integers to do the whole thing, leaving only the need for a final move of decimal point, it was not easy. Ended up with a very dissimilar representation of the algorithm, using numbers specifically geared to the problem at hand, nothing universal like Gustafson. When I read his material I was intrigued that one of the objectives was to obtain more numerical accuracy from lesser-bit computers himself. reply librasteve 4 hours agoprevGreat article! you may be interested in the relationship between programmatic Junctions and Interval Arithmetic ... a question in our Discord channel asked \"why are arithmetic operations on Ranges restricted\" with some examples like this: (1..2) + 3 => (4..5) #ok (1..2) + (3..4) => 4 #not (4..6)! to cut a long story short, I made the Math::Interval module to extend the Range class to provide a working Interval Arithmetic model that uses a Junctions of Ranges to represent disjoint results # a divisor that spans 0 produces a disjoint multi-interval my $j1 = (2..4)/(-2..4); ddt $j1; #any(-Inf..-1.0, 0.5..Inf).Junction say 3 ~~ $j1; #True (The long story is at https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2023/11/11/junctions-for-i...) reply klysm 1 hour agoparentA good mental tool for thinking about that is adding two dice rolls reply drsopp 11 hours agoprevThere are several ways to handle uncertainties and propagation of error.

We can write this as an interval (6.9, 7.1). This is not how measurements work in physics. You have to measure at least twice (If you measure only once the sample variance will be infinite due to the bessel correction). Only then you can compute the mean value of your measurements and the standard error. Assuming you made two measurements 6.9 and 7.1 you would write length = 7.0 +/- 0.1 .

An interval type is just an intersection of two inequality types. For example `(>0) & ( Why x^2 isn't always x * x It turns out he's claiming they're different if x^2 is interpreted as squaring each element in the interval x, while x * x is interpreted as a cross product: the interval obtained by multiplying all pairs of elements in the interval.

Is that some kind of standard notation? reply Twisol 17 hours agoparent\"Pointwise squaring on an interval x\" is just a weird way of describing the usual function f(x) = x^2 with domain restricted to an interval. It's pointwise because that's how functions f : R -> R are defined: given a point, or value, of the domain, give me a new point in the codomain. If you think of `x` as a whole interval unto itself, and not just a single point, then I think the options become more interesting. The most natural product on two sets is indeed the cross product; but for intervals, I can imagine defining a common parameterization over both intervals and then multiplying pointwise up to that parameterization. reply GrantMoyer 15 hours agoparentprevIt makes sense if instead of thinking about intervals, you think about the supports of random variables[1].

Yes, it's just algebra. reply tel 4 hours agoparentprevThere's some abuse of poor notation going on in the article. I don't think the author is intending to be confusing through this imprecision, but instead is just faithfully representing the common way people discuss this kind of stuff. But it is confusing. And it is imprecise. (I'll use x below to mean multiplication due to HN's weird formatting rules) Nominally, if we have two intervals A and B we might anticipate there's a difference between AxA and AxB. In normal math we expect this because we use the different letters to indicate the potential for A and B to be different. Another way of saying it is to say that AxA = AxB exactly when A = B. The trick of language with interval math is that people often want to write things like A = (l, h). This is meaningful, the lower and upper bounds of the interval are important descriptors of the interval itself. But let's say that it's also true that B = (l, h). If A = B, then it's definitely true that their lower and upper bounds will coincide, but is the converse true? Is it possible for two intervals to have coincident bounds but still be unequal? What does equality mean now? In probability math, the same issue arises around the concept of a random variable (rv). Two rvs might, when examined individually, appear to be the same. They might have the same distribution, but we are more cautious than that. We reserve the right to also ask things like \"are the rvs A and B independent?\" or, more generally, \"what is the joint distribution of (A, B)?\". These questions reinforce the idea that random variables are not equivalent to their (marginal) distributions. That information is a very useful measurement of a rv, but it is still a partial measurement that throws away some information. In particular, when multiple rvs are being considered, marginal distributions fail to capture how the rvs interrelate. We can steal the formal techniques of probability theory and apply them to give a better definition of an interval. Like an rv, we'll define an interval to be a function from some underlying source of uncertainty, i.e. A(w) and B(w). Maybe more intuitively, we'll think of A and B as \"partial measurements\" of that underlying uncertainty. The \"underlying uncertainty\" can be a stand in for all the myriad ways that our measurements (or machining work, or particular details of IEEE rounding) go awry, like being just a fraction of a degree off perpendicular to the walls we're measuring to see if that couch will fit. We'll define the lower and upper bounds of these intervals as the minimum and maximum values they take, l(A) = min_w A(w) and u(A) = max_w A(w). Now, when multiplying functions on the same domain, the standard meaning of multiplication is pointwise multiplication: (A x B)(w) = A(w) x B(w) and so the lower and upper bounds of AxB suddenly have a very complex relationship with the lower and upper bounds of A and B on their own. l(A x B) = min_w A(w) x B(w) u(A x B) = max_w A(w) x B(w) So with all this additional formal mechanism, we can recover how pointwise multiplication makes sense. We can also distinguish AxA and AxB as being potentially very different intervals even when l(A) = l(B) and u(A) = u(B). (As a final, very optional note, the thing that makes interval math different from probability theory is that the underlying space of uncertainty is not endowed with a probability measure, so we can only talk about things like min and max. It also seems like we can make the underlying event space much less abstract and just use a sufficiently high-dimensional hypercube.) reply IshKebab 12 hours agoparentprevYeah it sounds like something he's made up.

By the way, SI has so many multiplying/dividing prefixes so that you could pick the units that would make most of the numbers in your field integers. reply bjourne 18 hours agoprevCouldn't the overdetermination problem be solved by tagging intervals with their ids? E.g., \"x*x\" should be resolved as \"(x, i[-3, 3])*(x, i[-3, 3])\" and \"i[-3, 3]*i[-3, 3]\" as \"(nil, i[-3, 3])*(nil, i[-3, 3])\". Since the tag matches in the first expression and not in the second (nil != nil) different rules could be used. Btw this comes up a lot in compiler design for dynamic languages since constraining the value ranges of variables means that you can implement them more efficiently. In static languages it is not as important since the domains of most variables are either given to you or inferred by the type system. Also an interesting head scratcher is how to implement interval arithmetic for modulus: i[3,6] % i[3, 6] = ???* reply kragen 17 hours agoparentthis is basically how affine arithmetic works. but in interval arithmetic or modal interval arithmetic the representation of a float is two floats, and in affine arithmetic the representation of a float is a potentially unboundedly large set of float coefficients, none of which can be safely ignored, so there are some drawbacks to this approach i'm not sure why wayne doesn't mention affine arithmetic and modal interval arithmetic in this post; i'd think they were relevant reply lifthrasiir 14 hours agorootparent> none of which can be safely ignored Or more accurately speaking, they can be ignored but at some expense of accuracy. (You can always approximate every variable with a (-inf, +inf) interval!) There are several working ways to \"compress\" affine variables when they get too many. Probably a worse problem with AA is that every multiplication introduces a new variable, so it can be very frequent to head into the maximum number of variables set for the reasonable performance... reply kragen 10 hours agorootparentagreed. i find reduced affine arithmetic the most appealing, but haven't tried it reply moonchild 10 hours agoparentprevthis requires all terms to be represented symbolically, which 'works', but now you need a full-blown symbolic rewrite engine to try to simplify things. very reasonable for an optimiser but not so much for numerics. for numerics a more common approach is interval mincing. we have a function f(x) = x*x, and try to apply f([-3 3]). we can 'mince' the inner interval and say that (e.g.) [-3 3] = [-3 -1] U [-1 1] U [1 3]. so we have f([-3 -1] U [-1 1] U [1 3]); distribute function application over U (which is sound) to get f([-3 -1]) U f([-1 1]) U f([1 3]), which is obviously tighter than f([-3 3]). we picked a subinterval size of 2, but can shrink it arbitrarily until we're satisfied with the result. this technique is essentially a form of case analysis, and can also be applied to optimisers/static analysers (complementarily to simplifying rewrites) reply kragen 10 hours agorootparentaffine arithmetic does not need a full-blown symbolic rewrite engine, though it too sometimes produces overbroad intervals reply moonchild 10 hours agorootparentso a middle ground (as many pseudo-symbolic approaches). glanced at wikipedia—this seems not dissimilar conceptually to the abstract domain of polyhedra, in that it's symbolic but has a flat structure and expresses only linear relationships. of course, polyhedra are exponential where affine arithmetic is quadratic (overall space in number of terms), and polyhedra are global where affine is local (therefore easier to implement as a library, but no sharing). more missed connections between numerical analysis and program analysis? (meh but no sharing probably means affine generally loses for a given resource budget. would still be interesting to try though) reply kragen 9 hours agorootparentthis sounds interesting! i think aa is linear in the number of terms, and reduced aa is linear in the number of independent variables, but possibly i don't understand your meaning reply moonchild 9 hours agorootparentfeel free to ping on irc if interested in chatting more on the topic, though i'm not sure i have a ton more original thoughts atm if you have an expression with n terms, then you will end up with O(n) terms each taking up O(n) space, so the overall space usage is quadratic. (that's the fair way to compare to polyhedra since they're always global) reply kragen 8 hours agorootparentwhat's the scenario where you'd materialize the values of all those terms at once? maybe cache-invalidation-based incremental evaluation, like acar's self-adjusting computation? affine arithmetic (or raa) seems like it could be a good fit for that kind of thing, because it can handle small input changes within the affine approximation (with just a multiply-accumulate) and sometimes would benefit from being able to recursively subdivide the input space into smaller intervals without recomputing unaffected parts of the expression on the other hand, if i am merely evaluating a polynomial with n terms, such as 3x⁴ - 2x³ + 17x² + x - 4 for n = 5, i only have three aa objects at any one time during evaluation of the expression, regardless of n. in this case the program might look like this a ← x; a ← a⁴; b ← 3; a ← a · b b ← x; b ← b³; c ← -2; b ← b · c; a ← a + b b ← x; b ← b²; c ← 17; b ← b · c; a ← a + b b ← x; a ← a + b b ← -4; a ← a + b this assumes we have three registers for aa objects, creatively called a, b, and c; that we can only do arithmetic on these registers; and that the power operations are unary (otherwise they require an additional register) this is true of any polynomial with horner's-rule evaluation we can cut this down to two registers a ← 3 b ← x; a ← a · b; b ← -2; a ← a + b b ← x; a ← a · b; b ← 17; a ← a + b b ← x; a ← a · b; b ← 1; a ← a + b b ← x; a ← a · b; b ← -4; a ← a + b obviously there do exist expressions with deeper minimum evaluation stacks, but i think they're only worst-case logarithmic in expression size, aren't they? reply _Microft 11 hours agoprevIf you are curious about this then you might also want to have a look at \"propagation of uncertainty\". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty (warning: contains math symbols) reply AstroJetson 10 hours agoprevThe real takeaway was the Frink language. https://frinklang.org.

When you ask if a single non-interval lies within a given interval, the answer is yes or no (with a given resolution). When you ask what the relationship between 2 intervals is, there are multiple answers (*). In a given problem domain, each one may have different semantic implications. (*) interval 1 is larger than interval 2 and fully includes it interval 2 is larger than interval 1 and fully includes it interval 1 begins before interval 2 interval 1 ends after interval 2 interval 2 begins before interval 1 interval 2 ends after interval 1 interval 1 and interval 2 are disjoint interval 1 and interval 2 are equivalent at a given resolution reply mikhailfranco 12 hours agoparentAllen's interval algebra describes the 2*6+1 = 13 relations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen's_interval_algebra It's possible to build a graph where the relations are nodes, and the edges are possible smooth operations on the intervals (e.g. translation).

Basically if you multiply two intervals (-3,3) * (-3,3), it's relevant whether it's actually the same quantity multiplied by itself (in which case, you want the answer 0-9, because you'll always be multiplying something like -1 * -1, because you're sampling once from the interval and then squaring it), or it's two different quantities, both of which are in the same interval, in which case the answer you want is (-9,9), because you could be multiplying something like -3 * 3, because you're sampling twice from the same interval and multiplying the two results together. reply zeehio 12 hours agoprevUsing intervals for measurements has some limitations. But for many use cases we do not need more than intervals, so it's nice to have convenient tools for them. Intervals are a convenient model. That's because measurements are complicated. You use a ruler (or some other instrument) to measure something and get a value x. You are happy. Then for some reason you decide to repeat the measurement and you get a slightly different value. And problems start. You decide to write down all the values you get. You are happy again. Shortly after, you realise you have to use those values in calculations and you just want \"one representative value\", so you take the average or \"the most common value\" or some other aggregation, use your intuition! Things start to go wrong when you have to take a decision by setting some threshold like \"I do this if my value is above a threshold\". Because the actual value may be different from your averaged number. So you take the standard deviation and call it the uncertainty x±s. But one day you realise that your measurements are not symmetric. You start by saying \"instead of x±s, I will use different upper and lower bounds to define an interval\". For instance some things are measured on a log scale and you have a measure like 100±\"one order of magnitude\" which is \"100, but may be between 10 and 1000\". Then you add a confidence, because you are not 100% certain you actually are in that range. Your measurement becomes \"with 95% confidence I can say the measure is in [10,1000], with an expected value of 100\". Then you want to combine and aggregate those intervals and you realise they within the intervals their regions are not uniform, you actually have a probability distribution. In the simple case is a Gaussian distribution, described with mean and variance. It can also be a binomial (a \"p out of n cases\" scenario). Or a lognormal like un our 10-1000 example. And now for each measure you take you need to understand what probability distribution it follows and estimate its parameters. And that parameter estimation is a measure, so it has confidence intervals as well. At this point adding two measurements becomes not so easy anymore... But don't panic! The nice part about all of this is that usually you don't care about precise error estimates, because you can live with bounding errors covering a worst case scenario. And you can use the Central Limit Theorem (sometimes it is abused rather than used) to simplify calculations. It is a rabbit hole and you need to know how deep you want to dig. Intervals are usually convenient enough. reply kerkeslager 14 hours agoprev [–] I've experimented on a few systems to apply interval arithmetic to type inference, i.e. // starRating is an int, meaning // integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. let starRating = console.readInt(\"How many stars do you rate this movie?\"); db.addStarRating(starRating); // starRatingList is a list> let starRatingList = db.readStarRatings(movie); // totalStarRatings is an int // this type can't be sized at compile time, but we can still check it! let totalStarRatings = sum(starRatings); // avgStarRating is a very difficult type, because we need to either have // a fraction type that's slow, or some handling of rounding/truncating // when we do division.

When they rug-pulled GAMA (after selling a bunch of NFTs), as consolation prize they \"open sourced\"[0] a few things. One of their many promises was that their space-station \"metaverse\" would have \"Quantum Engine AI Integration\" (letting you talk to NPCs, among other things). They released a lightly edited Unreal Engine game template (the \"metaverse\"), along side a file named `api.yml`[1] which documents an AsyncAPI[2] API (the \"AI integration\"). There is no actual integration, the API spec is just positioned adjacent to the Unreal project - there's a note in the README that amounts to \"integrate it yourself\". The back-end component was never open-sourced, and they've long since shut down the API server, but based on the docs, the API used by the r1 is clearly a direct evolution of that design. As for the R1's API, there is no documentation, but I partially reverse-engineered it and wrote some docs of my own[3], which is enough to see the similarities.

    "title": "The album art of Phil Hartmann (2022)",
    "originLink": "https://www.conorherbert.com/music/the-album-art-of-phil-hartmann",
    "originBody": "The Album Art of Phil Hartmann 24 Aug Written By Conor Herbert You might remember him from such roles as Troy McClure or Lionel Hutz, but in the years before legendary comic Phil Hartman shaved the second ‘n’ from his name, he was designing album art for some West Coast rock bands. The Phil Hartman story could — and perhaps should ‚ be told in two parts. In the first story, a charismatic comic goes from the stand-up circuit to Saturday Night Live, becoming an invaluable cast member on America’s most hallowed skit show and graduating to legendary roles on The Simpsons. In the second, an actor on the brink of genuine stardom is murdered, the victim of a terrifying act of domestic violence. These stories are best kept distinct in order to fully appreciate Hartman, who – like many tragic artists before him – runs the risk of becoming all but synonymous with his sensational death. His life was so much more than his tragic and infamous killing, enshrined not only in his art, but his charismatic personality often celebrated by his many co-stars and collaborators. We’ll never hear him as Zapp Brannigan or see him in the Troy McClure film he was planning, but thankfully, we’ll always have “A Fish Called Selma,” and we’ll never have to go without his pitch-perfect Reagan. There is, however, a third thread to Hartman’s story, a chapter of public life that’s far less recognized than his indelible screen presence. It picks up long before his charismatic rise to the peak of comedy, when Hartman was more class clown than class act, a Canadian kid moving about the United States. Still going by Hartmann, his birth name, Phil graduated from Westchester High in Los Angeles, taking up art at Santa Monica City College. He soon dropped out to become a roadie for local rock band Rockin’ Foo and, when the group needed art for their debut, his past as a visual art student made him a natural candidate for the job. The four-piece must’ve liked his work, as Hartmann illustrated — and signed — the art to both their first and second records. In 1972, three years on from dropping out, Hartmann started studying graphic design at California State University. This time around he graduated, but not before taking on some projects from his music scene connections. In ‘72 alone, Phil cut covers for power pop four-piece Bones, boasting an approachable group photo; The Pure Food and Drug Act, whose sole record bears an FDA-inspired stamp; and Pure Food and Drug Act member Harvey Mandel, for whom Hartmann depicted the scale-laden psychedelia of The Snake. On graduating, Phil opened his own graphic design studio and started taking on commissions. His first big client came to him through his brother, former Geffen-Roberts staffer John Hartmann, who’d recently left that fledgling managerial company and started his own business with Harlan Goodman. Hartmann & Goodman had managed to make away with a couple of Geffen’s clients, including British rock trio America — you know what they say, a Goodman is a Hartmann to find — but it was their totally new relationship with country rock band Poco that saw Phil strike up a rapport. In hindsight, it’s possible to see Poco as something of an odds-and-ends band. That’s not how it was at the time, but the group — founded by Buffalo Springfield alumni Richie Furay and Jim Messina — might be best remembered as a repository for the immense talent within. Bassist Randy Meisner left during their first record, taking the band’s country rock approach to new heights by co-founding The Eagles. His successor in Poco, Timothy B. Schmidt, would later succeed him in The Eagles after tensions led to a vicious backstage brawl. Poco carved out a string of classic rock hits, but their legacy is often positioned between what had been and what would eventually come to pass. It makes sense that Hartmann & Goodman would have had a connection to Poco, seeing as Geffen-Roberts had managed acts such as Buffalo Springfield’s Stephen Stills and Randy Meisner’s The Eagles in the early 1970s. The first record on which Hartmann & Goodman managed the group, 1974’s Seven, was also the first to boast Phil’s artwork, a minimalist image of an upright horseshoe on a solid green backdrop. If there’s nothing radical about the piece, it does speak to a few simple tenets of the group, imparting luck on their first post-Richie Furay record, tethering them to a classic symbol of country living, and tapping into the folklore of the untamed frontier. Phil’s second commission came just seven months later, when the quartet dropped Cantamos, a return to their lighter country-rock roots. Phil’s familiar Navajo-inspired textile pattern fits the sound, his folksy ochre palette tethering the Californian record to the distant folklore of the American Southwest. A quaint illustration sits inset, showing the four members jamming away inside a log cabin, flanked by a wood-burning stove. It’s cozy, it’s intimate, it’s unadorned: their electric riffs on hold, the art seems to centre the return of the classic, easygoing Poco. Hartmann’s graphic design breakout – if it could be called that – came in 1975, the same year that he joined the then-new Groundlings sketch troupe. Phil designed two albums that year: Poco’s Head Over Heels, a poppier tack that nonetheless flopped, and America’s History, a bestselling document of that West Coast trio’s first five years. That’s more on Dewey Bunnell, Gerry Beckley and Dan Peek’s hitmaking prowess than anything else, but Hartmann’s visuals make for a tender front to that premature celebration. An illustration suspended on a cream canvas, the drawing shows all three members surrounded by glimpses of their own past. Dan Peek, whose cowboy chic is based on a Hat Trick poster, beams from beyond Westminster, an allusion to the group’s beginnings as kids of UK-based USAF personnel. Gerry Beckley, centered, wears a shirt of leaves, a backdrop upon which Hartman sketches the Holiday cover. Dewey Bunnell’s appearance is also taken from a photograph originally released with Hat Trick, with the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge a reference to their recent Hearts cover. That job spawned another rapport and, over the next two years, Hartmann designed Poco’s Rose of Cimarron with Monterey Pop Festival art director Tom Wilkes, and the red-plated Indian Summer all by himself. He continued his streak with America by designing Hideaway, centering band shots by Henry Diltz; Harbor, framing Diltz’s tropical shots in a sunnier palette; and Live, casually laying Diltz’ photograph atop well-worn handwritten notation. The one and only record by L.A. quintet Silver, featuring the brother of Eagles member Bernie Leadon, was overseen by Hartmann & Goodman. It’s no surprise that Phil was responsible for the fairly simple design, framing pictures taken by prolific music photographer Guy Webster. If these records had seen Hartmann in more unadventurous straits — bulky, patterned and often revolving about the photos of others — his biggest personal achievement came in 1978, when Poco released their eleventh record, Legend. “I did over 40 album covers, including the white Poco album,” said Hartman in a 1996 interview. “That's the only piece I have up in my office.” More than just a passion project or a point of pride, Legend was both a personal achievement for Phil and a commercial peak for the radically restructured group. Arriving after years of commercial failure, Legend was recorded by Poco members Paul Cotton and Rusty Young, whose decision to start their own outfit was trumped by the label’s need for brand recognition. A radio-friendly pivot surely helped the record sell, but Hartmann’s cover can’t have hurt those figures, his minimalist rendering of a galloping horse befitting the lofty title. It’s little more than a handful of lines, arranged to both cut a figure and imply a shape unseen. The red eye sits as a solitary splash of colour, drawing the audience’s own to the deceptive simplicity of that eight-line head. It’s not hard to see why the cover ended up mounted on Phil’s office wall – not only is it entirely his own vision and handiwork, but it’s easily a standout in his oft-simple portfolio. It might’ve been the peak, or maybe it was just the best so far: either way, that very year, Phil made his acting debut in Brian Trenchard-Smith’s Ozploitation film, Stunt Rock. In 1979, Phil’s work with the Groundlings saw him become a leader in the troupe. He helped fellow Groundling Paul Reubens develop The Pee-wee Herman Show, a stage show that found its way to HBO in 1981. All the while, Hartmann took on a few more graphic design commissions, designing art for Michael Murphey’s 1979 record, Peaks Valleys Honky-Tonks & Alleys, which stressed folksy photography; America’s Silent Letter, which saw Phil working with photographer Gary Heery; and The Firesign Theatre’s Fighting Clowns, which fused his worlds of troupe comedy and graphic design. His final credits include a cover for America satellite Avalon, an AOR trio whose only record bore some graphic similarities to America’s Harbor, as well as two of Poco’s final records, 1982’s Ghost Town and 1984’s Inamorata. These final assignments were the product of faith alone – Hartmann & Goodman hadn’t managed Poco since Legend, and their late return to the younger Hartmann’s vision falls as a vote of confidence. Phil was confident too, but about something else altogether: in 1985, he co-wrote and appeared in Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, a role that helped him secure his place at Saturday Night Live. Phil’s graphic design days were over: he dropped the second ‘n’ from his surname, and the newly-christened Phil Hartman stepped to the national stage. Hartmann, left, with Poco. On October 11 1986, Phil Hartman made his debut on the 12th season of SNL. It was just two days later that America submitted their revised sales numbers to the RIAA, earning a quadruple platinum plaque for History. That’s more than four million copies in a little over a decade. The band haven’t run the numbers again in the thirty-six years since, but one thing’s for sure: even before he stepped onto the stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Hartmann’s art had gone international. These days, it seems that Hartmann’s most famous covers are the ones he didn’t design. A persistent rumour that he designed the cover for Steely Dan’s Aja isn’t all that far-fetched, given the proximity of Poco — bassist Schmidt sung backing vocals on three Aja tracks — and the minimalist bent that characterised some of Phil’s work. It’s nice to believe that Hartmann might’ve been hip to the Dan, but Aja owes its striking cover to photographer Hideki Fujii and graphic designers Patricia Mitsui and Geoff Westen. It’s also easy to see why some believe that Hartmann was responsible for America’s Hearts, but that cover was designed by the ever-prolific Gary Burden. That being said, there are more Hartmann covers out there. The man himself ballparked his folio at “more than 40” pieces, but Discogs puts just 21 covers to his name, suggesting that there’s just as many still waiting to be exhumed, their attributions yet to make it to the internet. It could be that they’re long out of print, tethered to minor projects that have since faded from our collective memory, or perhaps it’s an issue with credits, like his Crosby, Stills and Nash logo. That’s stuff we might never know. If one thing’s for sure, it’s that whether you know him as Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Lionel Hutz or Troy McClure, you might remember Phil Hartman from more places than you’d think.

The decision does not legalize possession of small amounts for personal use, but it will no longer be treated as a crime. The Supreme Court hasn’t decided at what level — quantity or amount — to draw the line between dealers and users. Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

There was a new drugs law in 2006, that was aiming exactly on \"decriminalization\", somewhat similar to what Portugal did a few years ago back then. It's considered only a misdemeanor to use drugs in Brazil. The thing is, in the law, it never says how much of a drug is a crime or not. So you can already guess what end up happening. The law in 2006 was so open, that what happened, was an increase of people arrested, and not a decrease. So in my opinion, this is a complete valid from Supreme Court, because there is a legal problem with how the lower courts are judging here. The decision from Supreme Court is actually because of a man that was convicted in São Paulo Court, with 3 grams (!). Fun fact: The 2006 law doesn't even mention which drug is a drug. It says that Anvisa (Brazil FDA) is that classify that. So if a President really want to make it LEGAL, they could just nominate liberal names on Anvisa, and suddenly, Anvisa could classify weed and other drugs as non-dangerous, and it would be legal to even sell it... Another fun fact: in 2000, by mistake, ANVISA removed a poppers drug (Chloroethane) from the drugs that was banned.... So for a few weeks, it was completely legal Chloroethane. And a guy end up being released from prison because of this! reply Perenti 14 hours agoprevI had a friend get charged with cultivation in 1982 for 200 female plants. His lawyer called in lots of witnesses that Geoff smoked a _lot_ of dope, and that it was for personal use. He also presented a petition with nearly half his village saying it was personal use, as he really smoked a _lot_ of dope. He also helped anyone with any task, and was a generally loved person, not a drug crazed maniac, but very very chill. He was fined for personal use. This was Australia, not Brazil, but Judges are supposed to use discretion.

Even with a super low final yield of only 1 oz per plant (this would be a beginner’s yield growing indoors, not someone with 200 plants), that would still be 200 oz of dried flower. 1 oz is like a year supply for an average person. I could see a heavy user getting through an ounce a month maybe? So this is still 10x what anyone would ever need, and that’s if you were a very inexperienced grower. reply metachris 12 hours agorootparent1ox seems like a year's supply for an average person. A really heavy smoker can consume up to several grams a day. Let's say 5 grams, that'd be 150g per month (5oz per month). Agree that it's hard to argue for 200 plants being personal use; 20 would be more realistic. For 200 plants, it's a big operation! Also, you can grow them in like 3-month cycles too. reply Retric 4 hours agorootparentSomeone smoking 5oz per month is likely making poor decisions.

The government decriminalizes the substance in some specified way, public platitudes are made about this widely known legal change, and police, on the streets, interacting with random people, continue to arrest them flagrantly for possession of any amount of marijuana out of sheer corrupt inertia until their victims cough up a bribe to avoid the tedious and sometimes dangerous process of being in custody and under blatantly false or at least ambiguously glued-up criminal charges. And so it goes, crap without end, Amen. Mexico didn't just decriminalize it either, the country's supreme court outright, definitively legalized recreational consumption and possession of marijuana in 2021, but because of a blend of dishonest law enforcement, state-level legal inertia and lack of clearly defined regulatory follow-through, and extremely ambiguous enforcement procedures, people, to this day, regularly get arrested and charged with possession, even of very small amounts. My main point: a media-friendly formal announcement of a certain new legal freedom in many countries (particularly developing countries with shitty, half-functional institutions) often widely fails to show meaningful improvements on the ground for years afterward. reply mandibeet 5 hours agoprevI think it is a major shift in drug policy in Brazil reply eru 15 hours agoprevSee https://archive.is/20240626025842/https://www.bloomberg.com/... for the whole text. When I only read the headline at first, I thought: the object level decision sounds good, but I'm worried this went via the judges, not lawmakers. Funny enough, when I open the article, I see that Brazil's President of Senate had exactly the same complaint. Something curious from the article: > Brazilian drug law states that it is a crime to buy, keep, transport or bring drugs for personal use, in this case with a light penalty. Each judge can decide what quantity or amount of marijuana is consistent with personal use or drug trafficking. According to top judges that vote in favor of the decriminalization, this perception reinforces bias, especially against poor and Black people. I would like to see the original quote from the judge here. I doubt the original talked about 'Black people' the same way that (translated) phrase would be understood by an American audience. EDIT: https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-supreme-court-decriminalizes-m... gives the name of the judge. > Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes said these existing laws disproportionately harm \"young people, especially Black people, who are treated as drug traffickers for possessing small amounts.\" So let's see if that's enough to dig up the original quote in Brazilian. Another update: https://www.poder360.com.br/justica/leia-frases-de-moraes-so... has was it likely the source of the English phrase: > Ao defender sua posição, o magistrado escreveu, por exemplo, que “os jovens, em especial os negros (pretos e pardos), analfabetos, são considerados traficantes com quantidades bem menores de drogas (maconha ou cocaína) do que os maiores de 30 anos, brancos e portadores de curso superior”. The important bit here being 'negros (pretos e pardos)'. A literal translation for 'negros' would indeed by 'blacks', but I wonder what the exact connotations in Brazil are. Wikipedia has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Brazilians The whole article is interesting, but here's something relevant to US cultural influence: > According to Edward Telles,[22] three different systems related to \"racial classification\" along the White-Black continuum are used in Brazil.[23] The first is the Census System, which distinguishes three categories: branco (White), pardo, and preto.[23] The second is the popular social system that uses many different categories, including the ambiguous term moreno (literally meaning \"tanned\", \"brunette\", or \"with an olive complexion\").[24] The third is the Black movement, which distinguishes only two categories, summing up pardos and pretos (\"blacks\", lowercase) as negros (\"Blacks\", with capital initial), and putting all others as \"whites\".[25] More recently, the term afrodescendente has been adopted for use,[26] but it is restricted to very formal discourse, such as governmental or academic discussions, being viewed by some as a cultural imposition from the \"politically correct speech\" associated with the United States. > Sociologist Simon Schwartzman points out that to \"substitute negro for preto, suppressing the pardo alternative would mean to impose unto Brazil a vision of the racial issue as a dichotomy, similar to that of the United States, which would not be true.\"[41] reply guitheengineer 14 hours agoparent> I would like to see the original quote from the judge here.

I watched the judge’s talk here in Portuguese https://youtu.be/qQYoE0xBkCo?si=wWfJf7Wjs4NKpO_5 Alexandre de Moraes referred to data that he had which showed that a young illiterate black guy will be considered a dealer with 20g of cannabis, while a middle aged graduated white man will need 60g for the same to happen. He also talks about what happens after someone gets caught with cannabis, they have to go watch a lecture, but since there’s no punishment for not attending it, nobody shows up. His intention is to remind everyone that the current state of the law is ineffective and ends up affecting only the underprivileged (while not discounting punishment for those who really are trying to sell drugs and benefit from it, mentioning that a person getting caught in the act of selling should be really punished). reply HeatrayEnjoyer 15 hours agoparentprev>the object level decision sounds good, but I'm worried this went via the judges, not lawmakers.

Huh, who says that? I just want, ideally, democratically elected lawmakers to make an actual law explicitly spelling out things. Because what a judge cobbles together, another judge can take away.

In practice judges in Civil Law systems also tend to let themselves be guided by precedent. (Conversely, in Common Law precedent crumbles before a judge sufficiently motivated to find reasons why the case before her differs enough to warrant a new judgement. Often there are even multiple precedents to choose from, depending on which features of the case you want to emphasise. Identifying a precedent is like find a metaphor or analogy.) reply kiba 15 hours agorootparentprevIt is difficult to codify emerging societal consensus because the founders deliberately made it difficult, so judges get around the difficulty of codifying consensus by changing their interpretation of the law, in effect creating new laws. The proper way to do this may be via constitutional amendment, perhaps regularly. But the structure of the constitution makes it difficult to do regular amendment and changes. Also, just as Judges can change their interpretation of the law for the better, they can also do the reverse. It would be better for example, if abortion rights was made more explicit or made outright a right guaranteed by the constitution. reply eru 14 hours agorootparent> Also, just as Judges can change their interpretation of the law for the better, they can also do the reverse.

Yes, I agree about the possibility of reversal! --- At the risk of going on a tangent: There's some argument to be made that eg foreign policy is best handled at the federal level, but other things like rules on acceptable levels of noise or the schedule for garbage collection should be handled my more local authorities. It's easy to see that eg Florida has very different concerns about garbage rotting away in the hot weather compared to Alaska perhaps worrying about attracting polar bears? See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity > Subsidiarity is a principle of social organization that holds that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate or local level that is consistent with their resolution. The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as \"the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level\".[1] The concept is applicable in the fields of government, political science, neuropsychology, cybernetics, management and in military command (mission command). The OED adds that the term \"subsidiarity\" in English follows the early German usage of \"Subsidiarität\".[2] More distantly, it is derived from the Latin verb subsidio (to aid or help), and the related noun subsidium (aid or assistance). If you care about local self rule and subsidiarity at all, rules on abortion are something that should probably be handled by perhaps the counties or at most the states. Compare also how things like education, traffic rules and manslaughter are handled by the states. Curiously enough, Germany handles rules on abortion with an explicit law at the federal level, most other healthcare regulations being done at the state level. I wonder what the history there is. Perhaps it wasn't historically seen as particularly related to healthcare? In any case, I agree that an explicit rule on abortion on any level is probably better than just relying on judges. Laws can't and shouldn't handle every case explicitly, and it's good to have judges. But if you have an issues that's so politically prominent, it makes sense to give it an explicit rule. reply rayiner 7 hours agorootparentIt’s funny you mention German law, because technically the law in Germany is that abortion violates the right to life guaranteed in the Basic Law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Constitutional_Court_ab...

I wonder what the history there is. Perhaps it wasn't historically seen as particularly related to healthcare? Going on a tangent here, but one reason is that the law predates both the federal states (in their current form) and healthcare regulations. The relevant paragraph 218 StGB dates back to the creation of imperial law in the German Empire of 1871 and was later carried over by the successor states. Compulsory health insurance as a cornerstone of the federal healthcare system was mandated by Bismarck some 12 years later. (140 years ago, and some countries still dont have that, smh) But you're also right in that it wasn't made in the context of healthcare, but is actually a (priviledged) case of homicide law - which is obviously federal. It's got a quite interesting history really.

Roe got it from Griswold and Griswold got it from “penumbras.” It’s constitutional “law” from the mid-20th century, when old white men could just pull things out of their butt and say “that’s the law.” It’s like psychology before it was scientific and empirical. What’s “reactionary” about believing that stuff that’s in the constitution is the law and stuff that isn’t isn’t? The “right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” is not only in the Constitutional text, but gets its own whole-ass amendment. (And nobody is dropping any words. It says “militia” not “military.” The militia was a bring-your-own-gun concept at the time the second amendment was written.) reply vkou 3 hours agorootparentThere's a right to the security of your person and effects, which requires the right to body autonomy.

What is a “human right?” How do you ascertain what is and isn’t such a right? How does a judge decide something is a “human right” that justifies overriding democratically adopted law? To me it seems like the concept of “human rights” is like the idea that there is “divine law” that overrides man-made law, which judges discover by looking into seeing stones.

This is a consequence of slavery and the way the country dealt with its end, pushing former slaves to marginalization. And I believe the US went through similar developments, no?

    "originBody": "Skip to Main Log in June 11, 2024 Half of Workers Around the World Are Struggling with Burnout New Study from BCG Reveals That When Employees Feel Included at Work, the Likelihood of Burnout Is Halved Report Highlights Four Key Employee Sentiments That Have the Biggest Impact on Inclusion BOSTON—At some point in their careers, most, if not all, employees around the world have likely experienced symptoms of burnout at work—a state of exhaustion characterized by disenchantment with one’s job and a sense of inefficiency. A new report released today by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reveals that, on average, 48% of workers from eight countries indicate that they are currently grappling with burnout. Based on a survey of 11,000 desk-based and frontline workers in eight countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, UK, and US) and titled Four Keys to Boosting Inclusion and Beating Burnout, the report also reveals that when employees feel included at work, burnout is halved. Inclusion is central to building and maintaining a successful workforce. Inclusion in the workplace means that employees feel valued, respected, supported, and like they belong. Workers experiencing higher inclusion are also more likely to stay in their jobs, decreasing turnover costs for businesses. For this research, BCG quantified inclusion as a score of how inclusive an employee finds the workplace to be, using BCG’s BLISS Index, a statistically rigorous tool that identifies the factors that most strongly influence feelings of inclusion in the workplace. Further, the survey revealed four sentiments that have the greatest impact on employees’ overall sense of feeling included: Good access to resources Senior managerial support Psychological safety with direct manager Fair and equal opportunity for success These signal how much, or how little, people are experiencing inclusion in the workplace. When employees feel that these sentiments are positively addressed in their workplace, they feel more included and less burned out. Unfortunately, these most important sentiments are also the ones where survey respondents indicated the lowest levels of satisfaction. And while burnout is prevalent across all employee types, it’s far higher for certain subgroups. Women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and deskless workers experienced up to 26% higher burnout. Moreover, these employee groups reported lower inclusion than employees who were in majority groups or were desk-based. Feeling included means many different things to many different people. It follows that building inclusion can be daunting. But focusing on these four most important sentiments gives employers a clear starting point to ask workers the right questions and focus their efforts to understand the employee experience. “Inclusion doesn’t end at recruitment. It requires listening to workers on an ongoing basis and addressing their pain points. It must address both the employee offer and the daily experience of employees with their managers,” said Gabrielle Novacek, a managing director and partner at BCG and coauthor of the report. “By focusing on the four key areas and diagnosing where they may be falling short in their current efforts to meet their employees’ needs, companies will be able to identify where to invest and innovate to improve feelings of inclusion and reduce burnout.

    "commentBody": "Half of Workers Around the World Are Struggling with Burnout (bcg.com)137 points by achenet 6 hours agohidepastfavorite170 comments Aurornis 6 hours agoI did some volunteer mentoring for a while. Burnout was the most common complaint. However, once you dug into each complaint of burnout you discovered that “burnout” has become a catch-all term for a very wide range of feelings. Before that experience I assumed everyone defined burnout as a severe state of deep distress and lack of energy following extended periods of intense stress, frustration, overwork, and/or lack of control. Instead, a lot of people used “burnout” more casually, as a catch-all term for any frustrations with their job any or intermittent tiredness. A lot of people would say they were suffering from burnout one week, then everything would be fine again the next Monday after they did something fun over the weekend. To them, burnout could be as simple as being a little tired one week or having to work full 8-hour days for a couple days in a row. The number of people for whom “burnout” meant a deep and serious affliction that required possibly months to recover from was a lot smaller. It’s similar to the way people casually talk about their “OCD” because they like to be organized, their “ADHD” when they have nothing resembling clinical ADHD, or their “PTSD” after a mildly unpleasant experience. These terms have become so diluted that they can mean almost anything when you ask people to self-report. Sure enough, this survey was self-reported. BCG wants to sell you services related to burnout, so maximizing the number of people reporting “burnout” is in their best interests. A self-report survey of unknown cohorts is the perfect way to maximize that number for their headline. reply hakanderyal 5 hours agoparentIn my experience there are different levels to burnout, with each stage is progressing towards a full-blown one like you described. Agreed that I also wouldn't trust any self-reported burnout unless the person has experienced a full-blown one before. reply snird 4 hours agoparentprevAt one point in my career, I've been a CTO of a startup company. I worked 12-14 hours a day, including weekends. My relationship with the CEO was bad, and he actively added \"senior tech leads\" to the company to compete with me. One day, I arrived to the office, and stood in the hallway across our office door. I froze. I couldn't physically move. I stood there, unable to move, for 2.5 hours until someone passed by and saw me. I'm sharing this story so that readers may have an idea of what severe burnout may look like. It's not that I didn't want to move - I couldn't, my brain didn't let me. I lost my ability to control my body at that point. reply ffsm8 3 hours agorootparentI don't think that'd still classify as burnout, honestly. That's more like a stress response from getting into the range of an abuser. I'm sure it was extremely traumatic for you, I just don't think anyone could classify such a response as burnout reply intended 3 hours agorootparentStress causes burnout. What they described would still be burnout. You’d need other features to get to abusive and a trauma response. reply snird 3 hours agorootparentprevNoted, I never delved deeper into the definitions - it was hard enough as it happened. If that's not burnout, then I don't know what is a burnout, apparently. I never even considered that. reply agumonkey 5 hours agoparentprevI wonder if this shift is due to the web. Everybody can read medical terms and interpret it as they want. reply intended 3 hours agoparentprevIts 11,000 responses. And They didnt ask people if they felt burnt out. reply dogleash 2 hours agoparentprevSelf-diagnosing is just part of the current fad of credentialism in discussing the psyche. Nobody can exhibit a pile of adjectives. They need to be attached to a proper noun from a book to be acknowledged. If there isn't a proper noun attached, the individual's external nonconformity or internal dissatisfaction are just a personal failing for not having fixed themselves already. And ironically it makes society worse at supporting everyone, even those for whom the proper noun is appropriate. reply bdcravens 6 hours agoprevMost people don't have \"fulfilling\" jobs. They have a paycheck. A very small percentage of Americans, let alone those around the world, have the privilege of analyzing how their job makes them feel. I get paid great money to play with computers. My father was an elementary school janitor. reply GiorgioG 6 hours agoparentI think Office Space summed up the problem nicely: \"Peter Gibbons: The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care. Bob Porter: Don't... don't care? Peter Gibbons: It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime; so where's the motivation? And here's something else, Bob: I have eight different bosses right now. Bob Slydell: I beg your pardon? Peter Gibbons: Eight bosses. Bob Slydell: Eight? Peter Gibbons: Eight, Bob. So that means that when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled; that, and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired.\" Most companies only care about the next quarter, or next investor call. Quality be damned, cut corners, work late. It's a never-ending series of death marches. reply VyseofArcadia 5 hours agorootparentWhen I was a youngster, the eight bosses line made me laugh because it was absurd. Deeper into my career, it makes me laugh because it's true. On a good day, on an unimportant project, I still have three bosses. I have my team lead, my PM, and my actual manager. Currently I'm on a cross-team project of critical importance, so you can add on my manager's manager, his manager, the other team's manager, and his manager. I've got seven goddamn people breathing down my neck on this. I used to work at a place where I had one manager, even for critically important projects. He was the only one breathing down my neck (and that wasn't often). No PM constantly hassling me to groom my backlog[0], the managers above my immediate manager all had enough trust to not directly meddle. Most productive I've ever been in my career. Ended up leaving because I just didn't give a shit about the project, but sometimes I dream of going back... [0] I need to rant about this. How am I supposed to be agile if I have to have my backlog completely planned out for the whole project? And I can't just estimate it or backlog the big chunks, because when we start making progress and I update the backlog to reflect things we've learned, I have to justify every single change to my PM who will grumble that we are going off plan. If I don't update the backlog, I get grilled about how accurate it is at the next too many cooks/status update meeting. We can either do agile or try to plan out the next six months of work at the start. Stop trying to make me do both. reply bdcravens 6 hours agorootparentprev> Most companies only care about the next quarter, or next investor call. Quality be damned, cut corners, work late. It's a never-ending series of death marches. Or next round of funding. > Quality be damned, cut corners, work late. It's a never-ending series of death marches. Ditto on working in a startup. reply lenerdenator 6 hours agorootparentprevBut if they don't only care about the next quarter how is Gerald Q. Public, born 1958, going to retire to Florida after buying three McMansions (and selling them all at a loss), a sports car, and paying for three divorce settlements? Who are we to deny him the experience of moving down to Boca so he can get his maintenance-provided house on a golf course wiped off its slab by a hurricane before being rebuilt so that he can play golf and wife swap until the dementia sets in? Workers, always thinking they make the value. reply thn-gap 6 hours agorootparentprevI watched Office Space for the first time when I was a teenager many years ago. It's funny how much my perception of the movie changed and how much it resonates with my work now, specially since the last years. One difference is that I have 10 different managers, which makes me dissociate enough from work without the need of any hypnotist. reply dwighttk 5 hours agorootparentprevI think Michael Bolton got it better Peter Gibbons: Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you'd do if you had a million dollars and you didn't have to work. And invariably what you'd say was supposed to be your career. So, if you wanted to fix old cars then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic. Samir: So what did you say? Peter Gibbons: I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech. Michael Bolton: No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to begin with. If everyone listened to her, there'd be no janitors, because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars. reply mlinhares 6 hours agorootparentprevThe lack of \"another dime\" when you work extra is also something that prevents most people from going above and beyond. If there's nothing else out there, why would you care? Working with my wife now to get her to start a business so we can keep my salary to pay the bills but focus on the business so our effort can have a meaningful impact on the bottom line. reply ralferoo 5 hours agorootparentI have one that's even worse than that. The company I worked at once insisted on you keeping a timesheet for work done and which clients should be billed for each 15 minute block. They charged the clients according to that. They even went as far as charging other internal teams for your time if you had a chat with a colleague in another team! If you, however, had any unaccounted for blocks (i.e. not 8h per day), it'd be brought up in your appraisal, and on one occasion when we were told we had to work overtime one evening (about 4 hours) but wouldn't be paid for it, that's when my feelings towards their policy really shifted. From that point on, even if I'd worked late to get the work done for the customer, I made sure that the timesheet only listed the 8 hours so that the company wasn't going to profit from my misfortune. They picked up on that too, and weren't happy, but there was nothing they could do about it. That culture was truly toxic as an employee. If you were a couple of minutes late for the start of the day, you were hauled into your manager's office for a 10 minute shouting at about the importance of time keeping. There was an unofficial \"flexitime\" working policy - \"you can start any time you like before 9 and end any time you like after 5:30\". Obviously, anyone who'd been there more than a year grew tired of this, and at 5:30 every day there was a stampede to leave the office. Nobody left even a minute early because we had timestamped entry/exit logs and we knew the consequences, but equally almost nobody was prepared to stay a minute longer than they had to. reply mlinhares 1 hour agorootparentWhat an insane hellscape. I'm glad I never worked in consultancies like this. reply nine_zeros 6 hours agorootparentprev> Peter Gibbons: Eight, Bob. So that means that when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled; that, and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired.\" This is literally my company. 8 bosses - all of who spending their entire existence in monitoring and PIPing engineers instead of using their authority to deliver constructive outcomes for the business. There is zero growth mentality among them (except headcount growth for their empires). Can't even imagine how to steer their org to produce value. Why the f will a IC care more about the success of the business than the 8 destructive bosses above them? reply marginalia_nu 6 hours agoparentprevBig part of the problem is arguably alienation. A janitorial job can be rewarding because you can see that you are making a difference in the world. You get to meet the people whose lives are improved by what you do, every day. Filling out spreadsheets, it can be hard to tell what the purpose of what you are doing, whom it benefits, and how the world would be worse off if you simply didn't show up. reply moooo99 6 hours agorootparentThis is it! People have a little bit of a screwed perception of what is „fulfilling“. Yes, there are people whose only kind of fulfilling may be working for a NGO that is trying to fight climate change, save kids in poor countries of the world or clean up the ocean from plastic waste. While all of those are certainly noble goals, the vast majority of people doesn’t even shoot that high to find any kind of purpose. Most people are already satisfied and feel a sense of accomplishment when their job creates something of value for *someone*. I had a job with a great paycheck, but spent 40 hours a week doing barely anything. It was fun at first, but it became physically exhausting. I have now a job with similar pay but I build apps that people actually use in their day to day work and quite enjoy, it’s significantly more stressful and demanding than not doing anything, but I don’t feel nearly as exhausted as I did with the previous job. I’ve felt it myself and have heard others talk about it, but there is an increasing number of jobs that is either objectively useless or perceived as such (by the people employed in that job). Either way, it’s not surprising to me that burnout continues to be on the rise. reply art-not 6 hours agorootparentI’ve had the same experience. I actually took a 40% pay cut to work somewhere where I had to actually do something, because of exhausting and depressing doing nothing was reply alan-hn 4 hours agorootparentThis is the reason I think its crazy how some people claim that UBI would cause everyone to become lazy and do nothing Nobody likes doing nothing reply boilerupnc 6 hours agorootparentprevThis! I enjoy my work in tech, but it mostly never seems to have a beginning nor an end. There’s always the next iteration of work waiting on the horizon. Even though I could afford to hire out, I relished the opportunity to do a repetitive home task like mowing the yard. The mental satisfaction of seeing an unkept yard transform into clean edges, clipped blade mulch islands and more order than chaos - all as a result of the sweat from my brow - provided an internal joy that is hard to describe. There was a beginning, middle and end which soothed my soul and reminded me of what I miss during my regular work in tech. reply twojacobtwo 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is a large part of my experience of burnout. Perhaps not so much alienation, as i understand it, but what you say in your last paragraph resonates with what really sticks in my mind when I'm starting to feel burnout. I end up having to endlessly push the idea of the pointlessness of my work out of my mind and that becomes a form of additional mental 'overhead', so to speak. reply brightball 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are a lot of other outlets to turn that job into something more fulfilling. - People do their job to make money to provide for their families. For some, that's all the justification you need. - If it pays well, donate a portion of your income to a charity that you believe in AND get involved with that charity. There are tons of great options out there like Habitat for Humanity, literacy programs, Shriner's, Boy Scouts or a local church just off the cuff. This turns your job into a way that you are helping your community through a organization with a greater purpose. It can shift your perspective. Just providing some ideas. To each their own. reply jordanb 6 hours agorootparentprevPeople think that the worst part of being a janitor is cleaning toilets. In reality the worst part of being a janitor is living in poverty. This is true about a lot of jobs in our economy. reply GiorgioG 6 hours agorootparentprevAt least in software it's not alienation, it's never-ending hamster-wheel of sprint after sprint of delivering features by cutting corners atop of existing cut corners. reply AnimalMuppet 6 hours agorootparentWhy do you think that isn't alienating? What you describe makes it almost impossible not to be alienated from your work output (and your company). reply drawkward 6 hours agorootparentprevUnless you have had a career as a janitor, it is extremely patronizing to tell the janitors of the world how fulfilling they should find their jobs. reply agnoster 6 hours agorootparentDidn't say \"should\", just said \"can\"? reply makeitdouble 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's less about personal views, and more about the fact that janitor's job is time and location bounded, and the result is immediate and readily assessable. Our jobs can be the polar opposite of all of that. reply senordevnyc 2 hours agorootparentprevHave you had a career as a janitor? reply marginalia_nu 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy is that? reply bartonfink 6 hours agorootparentFor the same reason it's inappropriate for me to say you're wasting your time on a third tier search engine and you should probably just give up. reply marginalia_nu 6 hours agorootparentYou're free to make judgements about my work all day. Now come on, give me an argument for why it is patronizing. Stop implying it. reply wtetzner 5 hours agorootparentI guess because if you haven't done it, how would you know if it's fulfilling? reply marginalia_nu 3 hours agorootparentI'm not claiming it is though, only comparing relative degrees of alienation from the outcome of your work. reply mikepurvis 3 hours agorootparentprev\"... how the world would be worse off if you simply didn't show up\" I've been reflecting on this recently and I think in the context of a job, it operates at both a macro and micro level, and ultimately to feel fulfilled in the long term you need to feel like you matter on both levels. Macro contributions are the stuff upper management sees— the new products and features, the deals closed, the systems you designed and maintained, the technical directions to advocate for and staff you mentor, the conference presentations you give. These are highly visible contributions are are \"easy\" to recognize you for, but on the other hand they're also relatively easy to succinctly describe, for example, on a job req, which will be necessary if you do indeed stop showing up. In contrast to this, the micro contributions are what your close colleagues see. They're who recognize your taste, your care and attention to detail, the thoughtfulness with which you lay out code, balance requirements, utilize tools, and maintain hard-to-measure things like interface boundaries and testability. It's these contributions that quietly keep technical debt under control, save time by preventing problems from ever occurring, and push systems toward ever greater reliability and observability. If you disappear tomorrow, none of this stuff will fall apart overnight; it will degrade in more subtle ways that take much longer to manifest as an actual \"problems\". I think for me at least, I sometimes feel a disconnect where I have lots of acknowledgment at the macro level, but still feel burnt out and unappreciated due to gaps at the micro level. The Q12 question about having a \"best friend at work\" [1] I think is also really tied into all of this, since that's likely to be a person who will see you and what you have to offer much more than a busy manager hustling between meetings all week and rubber-stamping your code reviews. [1]: https://www.gallup.com/workplace/397058/increasing-importanc... reply yetihehe 6 hours agorootparentprevIt can be even worse. When you do a stellar level job, no one complains. When yu slip a little, you have thousands of users complaining about some minor setting showing wrong values: \"This crap is useless, they can't even implement one value properly\". And you get this after sitting three weeks chasing some obscure bug deep in some library from your hardware vendor. reply flakeoil 6 hours agorootparentprevBut isn't part of taking a job in the first place to earn money so that you can eat, live and enjoy it with your family and friends. Maybe the issue is more that we earn so much and have no life outside of work so the \"earning money to live\" is not there anymore. We try to find meaning in the work itself instead of in the after-work part. reply everdrive 5 hours agorootparentprevI think the low status and the low pay of a janitorial job makes it pretty hard for a lot of people. Higher-paying, higher-status IT work has a different set of problems: meaninglessness, drudgery, and cognitive-dissonance. reply marginalia_nu 5 hours agorootparentWorth noting the comment is specifically about alienation, not which job is better across all axes. reply KineticLensman 4 hours agorootparentprev> You get to meet the people whose lives are improved by what you do, every day Yes! When I retired I started volunteering at a raptor conservation centre, and got given loads of simple mundane tasks. Some were really tedious (cleaning the birds' water bowls, removing poop, getting rid of nettles that blocked a view, etc etc) but at the end of the day my minder could see that the tasks had been done and that I wasn't a flake. They also demonstrated commitment, which helped me move up to helping with the birds themselves, and now I help fly them in experience days, showing them to paying members of the public, and bringing in funds that resource critical conservation projects (nest boxes, anti-poacher campaigns, etc). reply adolph 5 hours agorootparentprev> Big part of the problem is arguably alienation. I’ve heard said (don’t recall the specifics) Maslov’s hierarchy is upside down, that with sufficient meaning/purpose, many deprivations of lower elements can be handled. Not certain if I’d go that far, esp at extremes, but that the pieces of the “hierarchy” are more like eqalish puzzle pieces than a stacked pyramid. reply marginalia_nu 20 minutes agorootparentI think in general, if you arrange needs into a hierarchy, people will arrange them roughly in reverse of the degree to which they are being satisfied for the person you're asking. reply surgical_fire 6 hours agorootparentprevIn either case, the purpose of what you are doing is earning a salary to pay your bills. Workers would do well to always keep it in mind. reply marginalia_nu 6 hours agorootparentIf the only purpose of your life truly is to pay bills, that would cause anyone to burn out. reply dfxm12 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is some need to work to burnout or else they can't pay bills. This is especially true in places like the USA where so many social benefits are tied to employment. Employers understand this. They know a lapse in employment could be devastating, so they can put the screws to employees. reply fuzzfactor 3 hours agorootparentIf you are only working for money, you may or may not already be monetizing burnout itself. If not, it looks like a growth industry, and it might be a good idea to monetize the things that burn other people out. reply surgical_fire 6 hours agorootparentprevNah. You cab find happiness and purpose elsewhere. From family to hobbies. Work is merely a means to an end. reply sodality2 6 hours agorootparentprevNot the only purpose of your life. Just the only purpose of working. reply marginalia_nu 6 hours agorootparentWith a full time job, you're spending most of your waking hours preparing to work, commuting to work, working, and commuting from work. There's not really much time and energy remaining to do something meaningful. Like it or not, your work is to a good approximation your life, the rest is a rounding error. reply sodality2 5 hours agorootparentI don’t think that’s always true. With remote work, flexible schedules, etc, you can reduce the costs of working. In the worst cases, you might have a long commute making your 8 hour work day into 10+. But you still have weekends and probably at least 6-8 waking hours outside of work. (I’m imagining an 8-6 with commute, so assuming 8 hours of sleep, 6-9pm and 5-8am) Best case, you remove a commute and gain a whole day back with a 4x8 schedule reply marginalia_nu 5 hours agorootparentThose additional 6-8 hours dwindle down to 1-2 hours real quick when you consider you still have housework to do on top of work, cooking, cleaning, washing, you also need to eat and buy groceries. Also can't do anything exciting immediately before going to sleep. reply harimau777 6 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds a lot like \"The peasants should know their place\". reply surgical_fire 6 hours agorootparentMuch to the opposite. The ruling class always want excuses to pay workers less. \"Purpose\" is one such bullshit. reply AnimalMuppet 6 hours agorootparentprevOf course I'm doing it for the money. I don't like my work that much. (When I was younger, I used to say \"Don't they realize that I'd do this for free?\" But even then, I'm not sure it was really true...) But when I was working in medical instruments, and they brought in a doctor who explained how our instrument turned a surgery that had a 50/50 survival rate into one that had better than a 99% survival rate... I was more motivated to work there, and to work well there, and not because I was getting more money. My work had a purpose. It wasn't just a job. reply drewcoo 6 hours agorootparentprevDo you say that as someone who's been a janitor or is this only fantasy janitoring? reply dfvnbggfg 6 hours agorootparentprev> You get to meet the people whose lives are improved by what you do, every day. dude have you ever been to high school? reply marginalia_nu 6 hours agorootparentI have been to high school, and I am very grateful for all the adults that put up with me, even though I was not at the time. reply AnimalMuppet 6 hours agorootparentprevHave you ever been to a high school that didn't have janitors? Peoples' lives are improved by what janitors do, even in high school. reply phil21 6 hours agoparentprev> My father was an elementary school janitor. If you paid me the same to be a janitor, I'd take that trade any day of the week. I've been a janitor before and while the job is not fun and has some shitty (pun intended) days - overall I was a better human being not being stuck behind a desk for 10+ hours a day. Unfortunately our economy is what it is, so you can only really be paid for non-physical work these days. Thus a lot of folks who are doing quite well on paper are struggling internally living a life that simply does not suit them. It's weird to live your entire life knowing you were not built to do what you do day in and day out to pay the bills. Gilded cages are rampant in our industry. reply lqet 6 hours agorootparentThe janitor in my school was a relaxed guy in his late 50s. He was always joking and seemed to be quite satisfied with his job. All the children respected him - he was the guy you turned to when something was not working right, and he fixed it. He and his family lived on the school campus in a nice bungalow with a nice garden. His children also went to my school. While his salary certainly wasn't great, he did not have to pay any rent (the bungalow was owned by the city and came with the job), and the job was super secure. He was also the person who worked for the school the longest (since the school opened in the early 70ies), and was a walking history book. In my previous job, we would regularly see a guy with a small truck delivering vegetables door-to-door during our lunch breaks. We all envied him. He was always smiling and whistling, while we were sitting miserably before our food, counting the minutes remaining before we had to go back into a hell of customer tickets and technical debt. reply hindsightbias 4 hours agorootparentOne of my job sites had an isle window overview of a couple acres of grassland. Whenever the grounds guy was mowing and rocking with his headphones guys would stop and watch him do a couple of rows. I don't think people who never mowed yards as a kid would get it. When people asked what I do in tech, I'd say \"tech janitor\". reply harimau777 6 hours agoparentprevI'm not sure that I think that burnout is directly related to a job being fulfilling. It seems to me that it is more related to having a lot of responsibility but very little power. Or somewhat equivalently, being in a position where other people can make your work much more difficult without you having much control over it. In software at least, I think it could also be related to the pace of modern development. Agile sprints mean that you are constantly in a situation where things are down to the wire. reply tonypace 5 hours agorootparentThat's it, a very clear formulation. As a teacher, that describes my experience precisely. I am willing to bet it describes all other high-burnout professions. reply rtpg 6 hours agoparentprevI don't want to exotisize \"blue collar\" labor. That being said, I've always wondered if burnout ends up being more likely in roles where you feel like you're suppose to care. Being bored all the time is annoying and sucks, but being in a thing where you feel like you _shouldn't_ be bored and yet are also sucks. Does it suck more? Not sure! reply vector_spaces 6 hours agorootparentI'm in tech after a decade working blue collar, most of my friends are still working blue collar, and they're all burned out Blue collar doesn't just pay you poorly -- it's also tedious, and there's a pervasive sense that nobody gives a damn about you, your safety, or really anything about you. \"nobody\" being managers, but also your white collar coworkers who \"work upstairs\", customers, security, etc. You have very little autonomy: you'll tend to have to ask permission to go for a bathroom break, or to step outside for a minute to get a breath of fresh air, or if anything is going to cause you to be more than 5 minutes late for your shift. Yes, you'll have to beg and might not even be allowed to attend funerals of close family members. You may or may not have to help the customer who keeps sexually harassing you. You probably will be asked to speak to customers with a certain tone and facial expression regardless of how awful you're feeling. Nobody cares that you just went through a breakup RE safety: you'll have employers doing everything from getting you to work with wiring that isn't up to code when you're not an electrician, to lifting things alone that nobody should lift alone, to working at an unsafe pace, to working during small disasters where half the business is underwater. You might not even be a full employee -- you'd be surprised how many dishwashers, waiters and cooks in San Francisco restaurants are employed as independent contractors but are effectively employees You aren't making much money, so commuting will tend to be a long slog. You might even be working more than one of these jobs. Yes, I've had \"cool\" low wage jobs with nice managers that tried to treat me like a human being. I know those exist. They are exceptional and often don't last Also I am not writing this to single out the parent, just want to affirm that your boring white collar job is better in ways you probably can't fathom and confirm that blue collar jobs are very much prone to burnout reply rtpg 6 hours agorootparentThanks for confirming this, I appreciate the blunt perspective here. The idea of even having to think about your own safety in that way is something I have never had to experience.

Burnout is something that happens to you no matter what you care about. reply jmyeet 5 hours agoparentprevPeople don't need fulfilling jobs. They need fulfilling lives. That means it should be relatively easy to earn enough to comfortably live, having enough time to have a family, spend time wiht that family, socialize, have hobbies, go on vacation, help out in their communities, etc. What's happened in the last 40-50 years is that productivity skyrocketed but real wages remained relatively stagnant to the point where you need 2 people each with a full-time job and each having a \"side hustle\" or second job just to make ends meet. And you'll still have a lower standard of living than someone working a basic job 50 years ago. Some turn this conversation, much like homelessness, into a \"personal moral failure\", meaning it's your fault if you don't have a fulfilling job. Not all jobs can be fulfilling. But if people earn a decent income they don't really care. We should instead talk about why the demand for greater and greater profits have concentrated the value created by workers into the hands of the very few and why the workers who create that value don't their fair share of those profits. reply blackeyeblitzar 6 hours agoparentprevI would say even most computer jobs aren’t fulfilling.

No one is actually doing the 100 hour weeks they glorify, because it’s impossible to sustain. The truth is though it’s a broken system. In my opinion even a startup should be able to make it on 40 hours.

I think being a hard worker regardless of reward is an honorable trait, but keeping that up for decades is difficult. Naturally I am very loyal and agreeable. I like to solve raw engineering problems, but also social ones. I find a way to adapt to pretty much anything and anyone. This almost always ends with my employer exploiting me. Recently I've switched it up. I focus for a solid 2-4 hours a day on my tasks, and I use the remaining time for learning. It keeps my mind moving and keeps burnout at bay. Even average engineers like myself can optimize their workflow endlessly. You have a few choices at that point. You can give your surplus labor back to your employer in exchange for raises, bonuses, promotions etc. You can take back those hours to improve your WLB. You can reinvest those hours into learning that benefits your current employer, but more importantly, makes you more attractive in the job market. Right now I find myself consistently choosing the third option. Not because I'm focused on maximizing my earnings, but because it is the most fulfilling and enjoyable option for me. reply snapcaster 6 hours agoparentWhy did you think being a hard worker regardless of reward is an honorable trait? I don't mean any disrespect but when i read sentences like that all that pops into my head is \"sucker\" reply francisofascii 5 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of indirect reasons to working hard. You are theoretically less likely to be fired. You gain a solid reputation among colleagues. You get better at the job which make is easier to get hired elsewhere. Also your conscience plays into it. You feel guilty if you slack off. And there is ego, people want to be the best, or at least not the worst. reply snapcaster 4 hours agorootparentOkay to be clear, the \"without reward\" is the part that makes you a sucker not hard work by itself reply RHSeeger 5 hours agorootparentprevI guess it depends on your definition of \"hard worker\", but I think that people should do the work they agreed to do, to the best of their ability. I hired a company to install new HVAC in my house, a number of years ago. They spent some time examining the house and came up with a plan. During the course of doing the work, they would occasionally touch base with me to discuss changes they thought made sense (moving one of the thermostat to a location that it more likely to result in the correct temperature, etc). They did a good job and put real effort into making sure I got what I needed. I hired an electrician to put some outlets in a floor, so that we didn't have cords reaching across the floor from the middle of the room. I described what I was looking to do (plug in the lazyboy, phones, lamp, etc). As he was nearing the completion of his work, I noticed that the outlets were way too recessed; anything with a larger plug (iphone charger) couldn't even plug into it. He pushed back when I told him it needed to be corrected; telling me I could just use an extension cord. I had to keep pushing to get him to spend the time (time that I was paying for per hour anyways) to fix it. There is a difference between \"getting the job done\" and \"doing a job to the best of your ability\"; not killing yourself, but making sure the job is done right, the way you would want it done for yourself. The later is what I consider hard working. I want that from the people I hire and I do my best to provide the same myself. > the way you would want it done for yourself Side note, the HVAC system was, give or take, the same system the owner of the company had in his own house. I got everything I could hope for out of their work, and I still reach out to them for anything related (and recommend them highly). reply swat535 2 hours agorootparentprevBecause it's a question of morality, if you think they are \"suckers\" for adhering to what they deemed as honorable, then I don't think I have much more to add.

This is an actual specialty, and though it be steeped in the 'soft' sciences, a bleak reality of getting humans into groups to achieve a common goal. When it works well, you get the A-Team. When it doesn't you get Game of Thrones. reply phil21 6 hours agoparentThe funny/ironic thing is, all those items tend to be the first to go when management experiences personal burn-out themselves.

Corporate work has gotten a hellscape. Work got ever more compressed as ever more oh so minute details are being constantly tracked and evaluated - just look at Amazon warehouse workers, your average callcenter staff, or truckers, once the \"kings of the roads\". Take a second too long on the loo and your manager gets automatically pinged, third time and you're let go. Or if you're in IT, the rat race to the bottom that is called \"agile\" with sprint points whatnot. And on top of that comes all the surveillance software where every mouse movement, every key stroke is analyzed for performance, and on top of that come stack ranking and similar bullshit pitting employees against each other. The trades don't have it much better. Private customers don't have much spare money left over so they let their stuff degrade until it breaks down completely which makes repair jobs much more complex and extensive, and the customers try to haggle on price wherever they can, landlords are notorious penny pinchers and large construction projects pit tradespeople from across the continent against each other, the cheapest bid wins. And anything public service has it the worst - education is usually the first ones who get their budgets cut when politicians need to fiat money (often leading to teachers having to pay for their own classroom supplies or assisting the poorest of the poor children from their own paycheck), payment usually sucks compared to the private sector, you're subject to ridiculous public records requirements, and (for the Americans) should Project 2025 pass as planned, what used to be career track positions will now to a large degree be political positions, so anything as simple as a party donation can led to you getting fired. reply goqu 6 hours agoprev [–] Some people can work long hours and never experience burnout because they love what they do, while others simply need a better work-life balance.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read! The feedback from the first ShowHN was invaluable and gave us our direction for the last three months, so we'd love to hear any more comments you have! hubraumhugo 2 hours agoDo you also see the ingestion process as the key challenge for many RAG systems to avoid \"garbage in, garbage out\"? How does R2R handle accurate data extraction for complex and diverse document types? We have a customer who has hundreds of thousands of unstructured and diverse PDFs (containing tables, forms, checkmarks, images, etc.), and they need to accurately convert these PDFs into markdown for RAG usage. Traditional OCR approaches fall short in many of these cases, so we've started using a combined multimodal LLM + OCR approach that has led to promising accuracy and consistency at scale (ping me if you want to give this a try). The RAG system itself is not a big pain point for them, but the accurate and efficient extraction and structuring of the data is. reply ocolegro 2 hours agoparentWe agree that ingestion and extraction are a big part of the problem for building high quality RAG. We've talked to a lot of different developers about these problems and haven't found a general consensus on what features are needed, so we are still evaluating advanced approaches. For now our implementation is more general and designed to work across a variety of documents. R2R was designed to be very easy to override with your own custom parsing logic for these reasons. Lastly, we have been focusing a lot of our effort on knowledge graphs since they provide an alternative way to enhance RAG systems. We are training our own model for triples extraction that will combine with the automatic knowledge graph construction in R2R. We are planning to release this in the coming weeks and are currently looking for beta testers [we made a signup form, here - https://forms.gle/g9x3pLpqx2kCPmcg6 for anyone interested] reply LifeIsBio 2 hours agoparentprevI want to second this. It seems like document chunking is the most difficult part of the pipeline at this point. You gave the example of unstructured PDF, but there are challenges with structured docs as well. We’ve run into docs that are hard to chunk because of this deeply nested and repeated structure. For example, there might be a long experimental protocol with multiple steps; at the end of each step, there’s a table “Debugging” for troubleshooting anything that might have gone wrong in that step. The debugging table is a natural chunk, except that once chunked there are a dozen such tables that are semantically similar when decoupled from their original context and position in the tree structure of the document. This is one example, but there are many other cases where key context for a chunk is nearby in a structured sense, but far away in the flattened document, and therefore completely lost when chunking. reply ocolegro 1 hour agorootparentIs this an example that could benefit from something like knowledge graph construction or structured entity extraction? I'm just curious because we have theorized and seen in practice that extraction is a way to answer questions which require connected information across disparate chunks, like you can see in the simple cookbook here [https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/knowledge-graph]. Or do you think this is something that can just be solved with more advanced multimodal ingestion? reply constantinum 50 minutes agoparentprevAny one here exploring to solve extraction/parsing problem for RAG, do try LLMWhisperer[1]. Try it with complex layout documents -> https://pg.llmwhisperer.unstract.com/ If anyone wants to solve for RAG right from loading from source, extraction, and sending processed data to destination/API, try Unstract [2] (it is open-source) [1] https://unstract.com/llmwhisperer/ [2] https://github.com/Zipstack/unstract reply lacoolj 1 hour agoparentprevI run into the same issue with an internal company RAG, all unstructured data in PDFs but even once converted to markdown, they still need fine-tuning and a lot of manual intervention. It feels like we are inching closer to automating this type of thing, or at the very least brute-forcing it in like the LLM race is trying to do with bigger models and larger contexts. Will have to play with this over a weekend and see what it might help me with :) reply machiaweliczny 2 hours agoparentprevTry sonnet 3.5 image understanding. reply ocolegro 1 hour agorootparentHave you tried it out yet, how does it compare with gpt-4o? reply jonathan-adly 2 hours agoprevThis is excellent.

I am leaving my position, and I recommended this to basically replace me with a junior dev who can just hit the API endpoints. reply michaelmior 2 hours agoparentAs someone without no experience with RAG in production, I'm curious how effective you've found HyDE to be in practice. reply ocolegro 1 hour agorootparentI can't answer for the kindly poster above (ty), but from our experience techniques like HyDE are great when you are getting a lot of comparative questions. For instance, if a user asks \"How does A compare to B\" then the query expansion element of HyDE is incredibly useful. The actual value of translating queries into answers for embedding is a bit unclear, since most embedding models we are using have been ft'ed to map queries onto answers. reply qeternity 1 hour agorootparentprevNot GP but Hyde is a crutch for having poor semantic indexing imho. Most people just take raw chunks and embed those. You really need a robust preprocessing pipeline. reply p1esk 1 hour agoprev“ What were the UK's top exports in 2023?\" \"List all YC founders that worked at Google and now have an AI startup.\" How to check the accuracy of the answers? Is there some kind of a detailed trace of how the answer was generated? reply ocolegro 1 hour agoparentgreat question, I can talk about how we do the more challenging \"List all YC founders that worked at Google and now have an AI startup.\" For this we have a target dataset (the YC co directory) that we have around 100 questions over. We have found that when feeding an entire company listing in along with a single question we can get an accurate single answer (needle in haystack problem). So to build our evaluation dataset we feed each question with each sample into the cheapest LLM we can find that reliably handles the job. We then aggregate the results. This is not perfect but it allows us to have a way to benchmark our knowledge graph construction and querying strategy so that we can tune the system ourselves. reply p1esk 5 minutes agorootparentOK, so you have a way to evaluate the accuracy and convince yourself that it’s probably works as expected. But what about me, a user? How can I check that the question I asked was answered correctly? reply FriendlyMike 57 minutes agoprevIs there a way to work with source code? I've been looking for a rag solution that can understand the graph of code. For example \"what analytics events get called when I click submit\" reply ocolegro 46 minutes agoparentNo we don't have any explicit code graph tools. Sourcegraph might be a good starting point for you, their SCIP indices are pretty nice reply sandeepnmenon 3 hours agoprevCould you provide more details on the multimodal data ingestion process? What types of data can R2R currently handle, and how are non-text data types embedded? Can the ingestion be streaming from logs? reply ocolegro 1 hour agoparentCurrently R2R has out of the box logic for the following: csv, docx, html, json, md, pdf, pptx, txt, xlsx, gif, jpg, png, svg, mp3, mp4. There are a lot of good questions around ingestion today, so we will likely figure out how to intelligently expand this. For mp3s we use whisper to transcribe, for videos we transcribe with whisper and sample frames to \"describe\" with a multimodal model. For images we again transcribe to a thorough text description - https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/multimodal We have been testing multi-modal embedding models and open source models to do the description generation. If anyone has suggestions on SOTA techniques that work well at scale we would love to chat and work to implement these. Long run we'd like the system to be able to handle multi-modal data locally. reply davedx 3 hours agoprevI’ve checked out quite a few RAG projects now and what I haven’t seen really solved is ingestion, it’s usually like “this is an endpoint or some connectors, have fun!”. How do I do a bulk/batch ingest of say, 10k html documents into this system? reply ocolegro 3 hours agoparentAll the pipelines are async, so for ingestion we have typically seen that R2R can saturate the vector db or embedding provider. We don't yet have backpressure so it is up to the client to rate limit. Ingestion is pretty straightforward, you can call R2R directly or use the client-server interface to pass the html files in directly to the ingest_files endpoint (https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/api-reference/endpoint/ingest_fil...). The data parsers are all fairly simple and easy to customize. Right now we use bs4 for handling HTML but have been considering other approaches. What specific features around ingestion have you found lacking? reply vintagedave 3 hours agoparentprevI'd like to know this too.

Can you talk a bit about how the process is faster/better optimized for the dev teams? Sounds like there's a big potential to accelerate time to MVP. reply ocolegro 4 hours agoparentSure, happy to. R2R is built around RESTful API and is dockerized, so devs can get started on app development immediately. The system was designed so that devs can typically scale data ingestion up to provider bottlenecks w/out extra work. We have implemented user-level permissions and high level document management alongside the vector db, which most devs need to build in a production setting, along with the API and data ingestion scaling. Lastly, we also log every search and RAG completion that flows through the system. This is really important to find weaknesses and tune the system over time. Most devs end up needing an observability solution for their RAG. All of these connect to an open source developer dashboard that allows you to see uploaded files, test different configs, etc. These basic features mean that devs can spend more time on iterating / customizing their application specific features like custom data ingestion, hybrid search and advanced RAG. reply causal 2 hours agoprevHave you integrated with any popular chat front-ends, e.g. OpenWebUI? reply ocolegro 1 hour agoparentNo not yet, I've had difficulty getting these different providers to work together on integrations. If you have any suggestions we are all ears. In the meantime we've built our own dashboard which shows ingested documents, and has a customizeable chat interface - https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard. It's still a bit rough though. reply SubiculumCode 1 hour agoprevI've been interested in building a RAG for my documents, but as an academic project I do not have the funds to spend on costly APIs like a lot of RAG projects out there depend on, not just LLM part, but for the reranking, chunking, etc, like those form Cohere.

It should be pretty smooth. reply ldjkfkdsjnv 3 hours agoprevThis looks great, will be giving it a shot today. Not to throw cold water on the release, but I have been look at different RAG platforms. Anyone have any insight into which is the flagship? It really seems like document chunking is not a problem that can be solved well generically. And RAG really hinges on which documents get retrieved/the correct metadata. Current approaches around this seem to be using a ReRanker, where we fetch a ton of information and prune it down. But still, document splitting, is tough. Especially when you start to add transcripts of video that can be a few hours long. reply wmays 4 hours agoprevWhat’s the benefit over langchain? Or other bigger platforms? reply ocolegro 44 minutes agoparentI'm just seeing this now. The key advantages can be extracted from the response above to Kluless - R2R is built around RESTful API and is dockerized, so devs can get started on app development immediately.

But your quickstart guide is still huge! It feels very much not \"quick\". How do you: * Install via Python * Throw a folder of documents at it * Have it set there providing a REST API to get results? Eg suppose I have an AI service already, so I throw up a private Railway instance of this as a Python app. There's a DB somewhere. As simple as possible. I can mimic it at home just running a local Python server. How do I do that? _That's_ the real quickstart. reply ocolegro 2 hours agoparent [–] You are right that the quickstart is pretty large, we will think about how we can trim that and show only the essentials. To do what you are requesting is pretty easy, you can just launch the server and use the client directly. The code would look like this: ```python from r2r import R2RClient base_url = \"http://localhost:8000\" # or other client = R2RClient(base_url) # load my_file_paths ... response = client.ingest_files(file_paths=my_file_paths) # optionally set metadata, document ids, etc..

Multiple security firms sounded the alarm on Tuesday, warning organizations whose websites use any JavaScript code from the polyfill.io domain to immediately remove it.

These in-fills make life easier for developers in that by using polyfillers, they know their web code will work across a greater range of browsers.

Affected site owners have also been alerted by the internet giant. \"We detected a security issue recently that may affect websites using certain third-party libraries,\" a Google spokesperson told The Register. \"To help potentially impacted advertisers secure their websites, we have been proactively sharing information on how to quickly mitigate the issue.\" Sites that embed poisoned scripts from polyfill.io and also bootcss.com may end up unexpectedly redirecting visitors away from the intended location, and send them to malicious sites, Google told advertisers. More than 100,000 sites are already carrying the hostile scripts, according to the Sansec security forensics team, which on Tuesday claimed Funnull, a CDN operator believed to be Chinese that bought the polyfill.io domain and its associated GitHub account in February, has since been using the service in a supply chain attack. Though Funnull claims to be based in Slovenia, and it says it has offices around the world, the listed addresses are nonsensical, the website's underlying language is Mandarin, it may actually by located in the Philippines, and there are other odd things about the organization, leading to folks suspecting the biz is actually Chinese in nature. Polyfill.io is used by academic library JSTOR as well as Intuit, World Economic Forum, and tons more. Since February, \"this domain was caught injecting malware on mobile devices via any site that embeds cdn.polyfill.io,\" Sansec, an e-commerce security company, warned, adding that any complaints about the malicious activity are quickly vanished from the GitHub repository. \"The polyfill code is dynamically generated based on the HTTP headers, so multiple attack vectors are likely,\" Sansec noted. It may take decade to shore up software supply chain security, says infosec CEO What happens when the maintainer of a JS library downloaded 26m times a week goes to prison for killing someone with a motorbike? Core-js just found out Over 170K users caught up in poisoned Python package ruse In the rush to build AI apps, please, please don't leave security behind In fact, Andrew Betts, who created the open source polyfill service project in the mid-2010s, told people earlier this year to not use polyfill.io at all. As we understand it, Betts maintained the project and contributed to its GitHub repo until a few years ago, arguing now that it's really no longer needed. In February, he said he had nothing to do with the domain name's sale, and presumably the associated GitHub repo, to the mysterious CDN, and urged everyone to remove its code from their webpages as a precaution following the change in ownership. \"If you own a website, loading a script implies an incredible relationship of trust with that third party,\" he Xeeted at the time. \"Do you actually trust them?\" Soon after other popular CDN providers including Fastly, where Betts works today, and Cloudflare created mirrors of polyfill.io so that sites could continue to use the code for the meanwhile without having to load in stuff from a suspected Chinese entity. \"The concerns are that any website embedding a link to the original polyfill.io domain will now be relying on Funnull to maintain and secure the underlying project to avoid the risk of a supply chain attack,\" Cloudflare's Sven Sauleau and Michael Tremante said in February. \"Such an attack would occur if the underlying third party is compromised or alters the code being served to end users in nefarious ways, causing, by consequence, all websites using the tool to be compromised,\" they added. Now that seems to be the case. ® Editor's note: This article was updated to clarify and include further observations about Funnull.

Barry Schwartz on June 25, 2024 at 9:00 amReading time: 2 minutes Chat with SearchBot Chat with SearchBot Please note that your conversations will be recorded. SearchBot: I am trained with Search Engine Land content. Ask me anything! Powered by Search Engine Land (and love) Close Google Search will stop its continuous scroll user experience where Google loads more results as you scroll past the first page of the search results. Instead, you will see see the classic and old pagination bar at the footer of the Google Search results. Desktop first. Starting today, Google will start to turn off continuous scroll for the desktop Google Search results. Google launched continuous scroll on desktop search in December 2022 and first in mobile search in October 2021. So continuous scroll only lasted about a year and a half for desktop search. Google will remove continuous scroll from the mobile search results in the coming month. What Google said. A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that today, June 25, removing the ability to continuously scroll on desktop Search results, followed by mobile in the coming months. The “Next” at the bottom of the page will show on desktop search and the “More results” button will show on mobile search. Google said this change is to allow the search company to serve the search results faster on more searches, instead of automatically loading results that users haven’t explicitly requested. Google also told us that it found that loading more results automatically didn’t lead to significantly higher satisfaction with Google Search. What continuous scroll looks like on desktop. Here is a GIF of continues scroll in action on desktop search: What the pagination bar looks like. Here is what the bottom of the page one Google Search results look like on desktop with the classic and old pagination bar: Why we care. If you were on page two, you may see less clicks to your website. It all depends on if those searchers scroll and now click to the next page. Also this may impact your Search Console data because searchers may scroll more or less versus click the “Next” button. Add Search Engine Land to your Google News feed.

Sure, it says \"X million results\", but if you actually start to scroll, you soon run out. Eg. a search for \"facebook\" only has 68 results! reply elaus 8 hours agoparentI didn't know this, but you're right: 56 results for Facebook! Not even very good results, just the usual random SEO spam mixed with relevant results. If this isn't an error, this is a HUGE change? reply silverquiet 8 hours agorootparentI would think that any more than one would be incorrect. reply londons_explore 7 hours agorootparentI can imagine you might want news about facebook. You might also be looking for third parties commenting on the trustworthyness or not of facebook as a service/company. You might be after investing info in meta. You might want to install their app you might want help logging in or a guide to setting up an account. I'd consider all of the above relevant enough to be worthy of a position on the results page. reply dustypotato 7 hours agorootparentYes, but they include a box for news in the first page. I assume 90% of people who search for google /facebook/youtube intend to go to the site itself. And if they want specifics they just type in the additional keywords. so this would be Facebook trustworthiness Facebook stock Facebook app Facebook account setup help . I guess google is no longer a \"search engine\" as in doing a keyword search across multiple webpages and returning the matches, but an AI powered answer engine that guesses what you want based on your keywords and only returns those results. reply gpderetta 7 hours agorootparentWhile you could potentially justify it by evoking an ill defined query intent detection, X returning less results than X+Y will always be surprising for me. reply idiotsecant 5 hours agorootparentBut why? That is the naïve assumption from the context of primitive search techniques, but in the space of actual answers I think its going the right thing. Just give the user what they asked for. reply JohnFen 4 hours agorootparentI think this approach is probably in line with Google's, or at least it seems like it. Trying to intuit what I really want instead of paying attention to what I actually searched for is also one of the big reasons why I find Google search to be terrible. I am not its target demographic, it appears. reply silverquiet 7 hours agorootparentprevOften I'm surprised at how I just seem to be wired differently from others - if I wanted any of the above, I'd probably search for them instead of just \"facebook\". reply eddd-ddde 7 hours agorootparentprevFacebook dot com. Facebook article on Wikipedia. Perhaps an entry for the movie as well. Maybe some information on the stock. I think a single result would be wrong. reply silverquiet 7 hours agorootparentHere's what I would search for for each of those. facebook facebook wiki facebook movie facebook stock (though I of course know the ticker symbol is FB, so I'd just type that into Yahoo Finance and it would know how to handle that) edit: I guess it's a reflection of my distrust of Google/most (all?) large companies - I really don't like it when they guide me in any direction other than what I've specified because I'm pretty sure it's some dark pattern designed to relieve me of my money. reply stogot 6 hours agorootparentI dislike needing to be this verbose with search engines, and hate it with voice assistants too. I’d rather a little inference than to have to be explicit every time reply squigz 6 hours agorootparentprevI don't really understand why that distrust doesn't seem to extend to wanting them to display a single result for something, as if you can trust that single result to be what you want? reply silverquiet 5 hours agorootparentThat's a fair point - I could be wrong about my motivation there; I was more or less thinking out loud. reply brokensegue 4 hours agorootparentprevThe ticker is meta reply renegat0x0 2 hours agorootparentprevI think search should also output links to some Facebook scandals, about Cambridge analytics, clearview, some research papers how Facebook affects children, speech rules dramas, Facebook myanmar scandal. I think one would have to explicitly search for these terms for anything like it to appear. If not then search should not be used to discover new topics. reply Bluestein 7 hours agoparentprevOn that note: \"nobody\" (nobody commercial, providers) wants \"organic\" results anymore. They want \"filtered\", algorithmic, \"suggested\" and the like. Besides, if their \"secret sauce\" algos are so good (such as they indeed are) at determining what will hit you the best, with the best likelihood of \"engagement\" (for whatever that is for the system in question), any extra effort put beyond the very few, first, results, is an inefficiency, and adds cost, so ... reply autoexec 1 hour agoparentprevGoogle wants you to be only focused on a small set of results, mostly the ads at the top of the results. They'd rather you refine your search giving them more data and more chances to show you top ad spots than let you scroll/next through results. reply renegat0x0 3 hours agoparentprevYes, Google made the Internet boring for ears now. How many results would you expect for terms like \"war\", \"peace\", \"elon musk\", \"bill gates\"? I would expect billions. Google has the data. So why does it not want to share it with you? - One reason might be that you will not be interested in articles from 2011... but that is quite sinister to me. Why Google should decide if I want to see results from around Bush administration? - Second reason is that some links are not safe for Google. Google will not show you results for emulation, because it might violate some patents, IPs. It plays nice to the point in destroys the Internet. - That is why I created list of domains https://github.com/rumca-js/Internet-Places-Database. I can search for something using my own off-line Internet meta data - The other thing is someone mentioned to me that it is easier to maintain small list of links, which you can blocklist. For political reasons it is difficult to show the world as is - Google is a potemkin village that showed you really good result as the first link, while trimming all the remaining links. Redirecting traffic from small sites to corporate overlords, since it made good deals with them - In era where Internet is full of walled gardens, I think even Google might struggle to scrape everything from facebook, or amazon reply mountainb 3 hours agorootparentIt is sinister. The internet is just not a good resource for reliable information. There are some databases that are good resources, but they are not on the public internet. The few good public databases like Archive.org are being litigated into oblivion. The powerful people in the US have decided that they want the internet to be like the old network news. For a brief moment in time, the internet was pretty good. Not anymore. It is a place to go to be censored, monitored, exploited, and to receive your maintenance level of corpo-gov propaganda. The \"social\" features are just there to create illusions of real activity and for various \"let 1000 flowers bloom\" type propaganda operations in which lonely people are baited into stating extreme positions before they become victims of a 1984 five minute hate session. reply m0guz 7 hours agoparentprev> Sure, it says \"X million results\" Google also removed that few months ago. reply svens_ 7 hours agorootparentIt's still available, just hidden in the search tools. reply mrkramer 7 hours agorootparentYea, you have to click \"Tools\" to see the number of search results and the time it took for Google to retrieve information. Again, idk why they hid that. reply kentonv 7 hours agorootparentThose counts have always been wildly inaccurate, to the point that engineers on the team were embarrassed to be displaying them, but product people felt it was important to the user experience anyway so kept it. Nice to see the engineers finally getting a win there. (I worked on Google search like 15 years ago. I'm assuming they haven't found a way to make the estimate any more accurate, since it was seen as intractable at the time.) reply cancerman 8 hours agoparentprevEven if there are more results, there are basically useless past, 10, maybe 20. They shove all the mainstream trash down our throats, even if it's not remotely related to the query, while never bothering with it really was. reply throwaway4good 8 hours agoparentprevFunny. I get 50 results for \"facebook\" - ending with: In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 50 already displayed. \"Infinite\" scroll until I hit that message (no pagination). If I search for \"foo\" - it will show a \"More results v\" button after about 50 and keep on doing that. I am in Germany. reply stogot 6 hours agorootparentNow I’m wondering what the missing 6 (from the OP 56) are compared to German results?! reply thih9 8 hours agoparentprevI'm already seeing the paginated search result page, perhaps I got assigned to the right AB test bin. And I can confirm, I searched for \"facebook\" and got 7 pages of results; last page was YouTube results only. reply consp 8 hours agorootparentOn Firefox this has always been the case for me. reply hifromwork 7 hours agorootparentSame for me - I never saw anything else than paginated search result. Maybe for some reason Firefox didn't get this feature? reply csmpltn 8 hours agoparentprevIf you hit the last page on the pagination bar, they just keep concatenating new page indexes at the end, so that it effectively grows infinitely large... reply oplaadpunt 8 hours agoparentprevIt doesn't actually say that any more for me on google, I think they removed it at some point when it obviously didn't make sense any more. reply bbarnett 8 hours agoparentprevThe sad part is, with them down ranking http only sites, and with all the spam farms, going 10+ \"pages\" in, eg 100+ links, used to be an easy way to get to real results. Then they added infinite scrolling, and oh well! They should add a \"this site hasn't changed in a decade\" or \"only give http results\" for people searching for older stuff. Google takes these weird stances, like making it impossible to find legacy sites (http sites) because they want to push encryption (fine, but don't hurt users!). Or refusing to add zoom + reflow on chrome (super simple to do, just use a virtual dpi), showing how little they care about those with vision issues, or the aged. Why? Repeatedly they've stated it is to \"punish\" sites not updating for mobile. Well, even mobile sites are hard to see for some. What a ridiculous, absurd, stupid response. The only people they are punishing is the sight impaired, or the aged. Thanks Google. reply Xelbair 8 hours agorootparentYou seem to be under assumption that they make changes for benefit of the user, but not the adtech. This is extremely weird assumption when talking about google. reply bbarnett 4 hours agorootparentIt's not extremely weird, when they stated both of those reasons, multiple times, in press releaes and bug reports. I am well aware of where their profits come from, but when going after them in the public sphere, you must address, and refute the reasons they publicly cite. Also note, often there are multiple reasons. By ripping down their stated reasons, and showing the absurdity of them, and also validating how it literally hurts accessibility for those with visual disabilities, you doubly ahow them to be an organization filled with uncaring individuals, which care not for accessibility. Personally, I wouldn't want to work in a place that wouldn't put in a wheelchair ramp. I wouldn't want to work with people that accept that. Yet that's Google. What does it say about those working there? reply tored 8 hours agoparentprevProbably curated by an intern. reply nashashmi 8 hours agoparentprevNot to mention the same results get recycled over and over again. Google is dead. What’s next? Kagi? reply cynicalsecurity 8 hours agoparentprevI don't remember seeing it any more for a very long time. Yeah, it felt like scam. reply nblgbg 8 hours agoparentprevthis is interesting ! do u know when they started doing this ? reply wordofx 9 hours agoprevInfinite scroll is probably the absolute worst ux feature ever conceived. Love to see it get ripped out of everything. reply lelandfe 8 hours agoparentI dunno, it’s pretty apt for Instagram, Twitter, etc. It is admittedly awful in many other situations, though. reply Gualdrapo 8 hours agorootparentIf by \"pretty apt\" you meant \"really effective into keeping their users scrolling mindlessly and contributing to the 'doomscrolling' effect\", yep. Seems to be pretty great for them. The funny thing is that for us who don't use Instagram or Twitter they won't let us scroll past a screen height without asking to be logged in... reply squigz 6 hours agorootparentIf users want to scroll endlessly, they should be able to, and they're going to, regardless of what scrolling implementation a platform uses - I scroll through many pages of HN just fine without infinite scroll. reply soraminazuki 5 hours agorootparentBut infinite scrolling never worked properly on browsers. With infinite scrolling, it just forgets everything once you navigate out of the page. To resume from where you were, you have to scroll and scroll and scroll and load the results all over again. Even if you were a single page away when you hit the back button. I've now been conditioned to open almost every link in a new tab because of this and it drives me crazy. This and the fact that going a back a page is so slow nowadays for whatever reason. reply sovok_x 3 hours agorootparentYou just use bad tools for that. When using custom AutoPagerize UserJS mod that utilizes pushState, endless scrolling works like a charm for me for years already. Like I can scroll to thousand-numbered items of HN seamlessly. It remembers the exact page you were on after you close the tab and overrides \"target\" property of added pages' links to open everything in new tabs regardlessly, preventing accidental page reloads. IDK why developers don't reproduce this. Kinda sad more and more Web sites switch to pointless AJAX app model recently and it stops working for those. reply nunez 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's true, but pagination without read ahead goes a long way to drop engagement, especially for users with slower Internet connections. reply nottorp 5 hours agorootparentUsing or thinking of \"engagement\" is the 8th deadly sin*. It just proves you're not thinking of the user's interests. * sin count taken from the Iron Maiden song. reply antisthenes 5 hours agorootparentprevIf infinite scroll was an alternative to regular pagination on every site, you'd have a point. But oftentimes it's the only option available, and it's garbage for everything except mindless scrolling. reply lelandfe 8 hours agorootparentprevI don't think Twitter even lets you scroll at all, these days. Anyway, \"HN yells at cloud\" was a fairly predictable low value comment. No, that's not what I mean. I mean \"pretty apt\" insofar as pagination would add no value. The order and count are changing so rapidly that infinite scroll is the obvious choice. reply mdorazio 7 hours agorootparentThe order should not be changing - that’s another user-hostile invention designed to encourage doomscrolling. Increasing count is a non-issue because once you reach a content piece you saw previously you know where you are (same as any bulletin board). reply lelandfe 7 hours agorootparentPeople use these apps because of their personalized feeds. Saying the apps shouldn't have that, or calling it anti-user, seems pretty misaligned to what the users actually do on them. The apps are not bulletin boards. Anyway, again - infinite scrolling is apt for their use cases. We can say that and also all frown at the concept of doomscrolling afterwards. reply nottorp 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's not. Unless you don't care about not being able to find where you were if you mistakenly scroll. reply dzhiurgis 8 hours agorootparentprevOr Google Sheets, which is even more complex. It gets particularly tricky when you got tons of data to be rendered but can't keep DOM in memory - you need to scroll virtually. reply average_r_user 8 hours agorootparentthis happens to me with big sheets it's annoying reply lofaszvanitt 6 hours agorootparentprevNo, it's just plain shit. When you have to interrupt your work you have to start all over again and you have zero indication where were you. Idiots come up with things and more idiots copy them and laud it as some kind of secret sauce. While it's just plain idiocy. reply lostlogin 9 hours agoparentprevIt would be ok if the scroll bar and slow loading could be solved. However I don’t think they can be. Rest in hell. reply mrspuratic 8 hours agoparentprevThe Google search page faux-infinite scroll is not just clumsy, it also breaks \"back\" navigation if you click through, then back, after loading more results. (edit: to clarify, I have the continuous scroll setting off, so it's \"incremental infinite scroll\" where More Results loads more results inline) reply rawmaterial 5 hours agoparentprevOnly if there are clickable links in the footer/colophon. For search results, tumblelogs etc it's fine (ideally you can create #links for sharing). reply tjpnz 8 hours agoparentprevRemember how they used to have links at the bottom of pages? If you scroll fast enough many implementations still retain them. That was one bandwagon people were quick to thoughtlessly jump on and even YouTube was half-assing it last I checked. reply ralusek 4 hours agoparentprevI love infinite scroll, and hate pagination. All lists should be some combination of these: infinite scroll, filterable, sortable. Pagination should never be involved. If I want to get to something on page 2, I scroll. For anything else, I’m going to sort and filter. If the thing I want is on page 17, and I see 1, 2, 3…79…159, 160, 161, I’m still just going to want to filter. The absolute best pagination is set up in a way that lets you binary search drill down for what you’re looking for, but even that is something I’d almost never prefer over filtering reply chrash 4 hours agorootparenthard disagree. i had an experience just this morning looking for some pictures from an event i participated in, and the infinite scrolling was absolutely infuriating. they didn't have an index to filter on, and when i clicked on a picture to download it and navigated back, it took me to the top of the page. i had to scroll through about a dozen loading indicators to get back to where i was. sure, this was a bad implementation, but adding it to every single list of results on the web is asinine trend chasing and bad UX. reply vishnugupta 8 hours agoparentprevThis infuriates me to no end. I like a news article, share or save the URL and when it’s opened it is something totally different. reply superhuzza 9 hours agoprevI'm surprised it took Google this long to come to this conclusion, there are so many UX downsides to infinite scroll, especially for SERPs. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/infinite-scrolling/ reply mrkramer 8 hours agoparentThey have infinite scroll for the YouTube search results but the irony is that the top search results are often not the ones you are looking for so you have to scroll somewhere to the middle to find useful results (or try different query or filters) and the bottom ones are something like related/similar videos from that topic. reply Zanfa 7 hours agorootparentYouTube's search is the worst. It's basically \"here's 3 videos potentially related to what you're searching for and here's another 50 completely unrelated videos\". reply sumedh 7 hours agorootparentThere has to be reason for that. Youtube obviously has smart engineers so they must be doing it on purpose. It is so frustrating though. reply rurp 3 hours agorootparentI would assume the reason is money, barring some counter evidence. Some videos must lead to longer sessions with higher engagement on average. Even for a single view session some videos will have more ads and/or more profitable ads in them. reply mrkramer 7 hours agorootparentprevYouTube takes thousands of data points and signals to rank search results and there are millions of videos to search and rank, it's quite hard problem to solve. Initially I wasn't a fan of vertical search engine/s but I think vertical video search engine for particular niche/s would be a good idea because YouTube is slacking. reply shermantanktop 7 hours agorootparentprevSearch engines are an engineering problem. Tuning ranking and relevance to be “good” on a mass-market content site is an unholy black art. The expectation is that results will accomplish numerous mutually contradictory goals, and be deeply personally relevant to a user who has used the search bar twice ever. reply ot 10 hours agoprev> Google said this change is to allow the search company to serve the search results faster on more searches I'm surprised that this makes enough of an impact: in order to find the top 10 results the engine needs to retrieve and rank a much larger number anyway (I'd guess at least 100 make it to the final stages of the funnel), and that is where virtually all the cost is. That initial set is probably held in some cache so that subsequent page loads don't re-do the search from scratch. So either this is a small win in frontend efficiency, or continuous scrolling is fast enough that a large fraction of users goes past the initial set? reply londons_explore 9 hours agoparentI suspect the problem is that the most expensive to serve users go past the initial set. Yet I believe most of those users are the lowest value users - many of them will be bots and web scrapers, whilst others might be real humans doing long tail queries that have no relevant ads to serve. reply nottorp 5 hours agorootparent> most of those users are the lowest value users Yes they are. Because they want results not SEO \"content\" sites. reply smeej 7 hours agorootparentprevI'd pay extra both to serve and to receive incredibly niche ads that would only show up for long tail queries. That was the original promise of all the ad tracking, wasn't it? Outrageously accurate ad targeting? Reach the weirdos in your tribe wherever they are? Now it just feels like drowning in a sea of things a bunch of giant corporations have decided everyone ought to want, and have been programming people to want en masse, rather than helping people find the unique, interesting little things they would actually want were it not for all the programming. reply haizhung 9 hours agoparentprevCaching the retrieved results for future follow-up page 2 queries is nontrivial. It’s also not clear if it’s worth it, the number of requests going to page 2 are in the lower percentages at best, maybe evenSo either this is a small win in frontend efficiency, or continuous scrolling is fast enough that a large fraction of users goes past the initial set? Yeah, it doesn't really make sense. Infinite scroll is pages tacked onto each other in the frontend - the backend should be doing the same amount of work for page X, except less overall because it's not returning the header/footer. I don't think frontend efficiency works either because the first page of results should be the same - or, possibly, the tiniest bit more work because now they have a footer to return as well. reply mrkramer 8 hours agoprevI actually liked continuous scroll and I thought it is a good change but I guess Google figured out that SEO people got upset because they couldn't brag how: \"We can make your website show up on the first page of Google search results.\" reply nblgbg 8 hours agoprevBring back the plain old google search without any of the AI!

    "originBody": "Ghosts in the ROM Uncategorized Add comments Aug 212012 While digging through dumps generated from the Apple Mac SE ROM images we noticed that there was a large amount of non-code, non-audio data. Adam Mayer tested different stride widths and found that at 67 bytes (536 pixels across) there appeared to be some sort of image data that clearly was a picture of people. The rest of the image was skewed and distorted, so we knew that it wasn’t stored as an uncompressed bitmap. After some investigation, we were able to decode the scrambled mess above and turn it into the full image with a hidden message from “Thu, Nov 20, 1986“: Read on for the reverse engineering details of how we recovered this and the other three photographs stored in the ROM, and some information about the Motorola 68000 era Macintosh. We found this Macintosh SE on the side of the road in Brooklyn and carried it to NYC Resistor. It boots, but lacks any media, so we decided to do some further digital archeology. We removed the two ROM chips (the ones in the middle of the board, above the VLSI ASIC that is the Integrated Woz Machine) and dumped them with my PROMdate device. The pinout for the chips is the same as the M27C512 PROM, but with the Vpp pin reused for A17. Since it is a mask ROM that can’t be reprogrammed there is no need for the programming pin (Thanks, Nick!). This exapnds the address space to 128 KB (1024 kilobits) compared to the 64 KB of the M27C512 programmable ROM. The m68k has a 16-bit wide bus, so each 128 KB 8-bit ROM has half a word and they need to be merged into a single 256 KB binary file. We knew we had a good dump and merge when strings on the file contained human readable textlike “Chicago“, “PACK” and “CDEF” (if you have the byte order wrong these will be “APKC“, etc). Reports of the easter egg said that it could be found by jumping to address 0x41D89A. I was able to boot the ROMs in Mini vMac and confirm that these were indeed the secret images that had already been discovered. That could have been the end of it, but we wanted to know how they were stored and displayed, and to be able to look for any other surprises stored in the ROM, so further investigation was required. To disassemble the ROM, I found it easiest to convert the raw binary dump to an ELF file so that objdump will process it. We know from history that the ROM was mapped to address 0x0040_0000 (24 MB) in memory, so we set the starting address of the ELF file there. IDA Pro is another great tool for doing exactly this sort of reverse engineering, but we’re using free software for this analysis. m68k-elf-objcopy --change-addresses=0x400000 --redefine-sym _binary_mac_se_bin_start=rom --strip-symbol _binary_mac_se_bin_size --strip-symbol _binary_mac_se_bin_end -I binary -O elf32-m68k -B m68k roms/mac-se.bin roms/mac-se.elf Looking at the easter egg function address with m68k-elf-objdump -D roms/mac-se.elf, we see: 41d89a: 4eba 0018 jsr %pc@(41d8b4 ) 41d89e: 5847 addqw #4,%d7 41d8a0: 0287 0000 000c andil #12,%d7 41d8a6: 6100 002e bsrw 41d8d641d8aa: 307c 00b5 moveaw #181,%a0 41d8ae: a03b 0120073 41d8b0: 4efa ffec jmp %pc@(41d89e ) The 0xa03b instruction is odd — Motorola reserved all instructions that start with 0xA, so this it is not a legal m68k instruction. Instead it will trigger an illegal instruction trap, and the trap handler looks at the next word and vectors to the appropriate handler. This A-line or A-trap is the official way to enter the Macintosh Toolbox and saves significant code space over the normal system call methods. This list of codes tells us that it is _Delay and that the value in %a0 will be used as an argument for how long to delay. We’ll be refering to this list again to understand what is going on in the assembly code. Based on this we can translate this function into something like “C”: void easter_egg(void) { func_41d8b4(); while (1) { d7 = (d7 + 4) & 0xC; func_0x41d8d6(); _Delay(181); } } The first function that this calls is 0x41d8b4: 41d8b4: 31fc ffff 0b9e movew #-1,b9e 41d8ba: 594f subqw #4,%sp 41d8bc: 2f3c 6262 6d63 movel #1650617699,%sp@- 41d8c2: 4267 clrw %sp@- 41d8c4: a9a0 0124640 41d8c6: 201f movel %sp@+,%d0 41d8c8: 6700 0050 beqw 41d91a41d8cc: 2040 moveal %d0,%a0 41d8ce: 21d0 0a78 movel %a0@,a78 41d8d2: 7e00 moveq #0,%d7 41d8d4: 4e75 rts ... 41d91a: a9ff 0124777 This makes the A-line call 0xA9A0, or _GetResource(0x62626d63) and sets 0xb9e, the RomInsertFlag to instruct the search function to look in the ROM tables. If the resource get fails it jumps to a debugger trap (0xA9FF), which halts the machine. Otherwise it zeros %d7 and reads the address of the resource from the address returned by _GetResource and writes that value into the global memory location 0xa78 (AppleScratch). If you speak ASCII, the constant might look interesting. It is a multi-byte character ‘bbmc‘, which you might have noticed in the strings output at offset 0x1af4e, in what appears to be some sort of structure: 001af3e: 5041 434b 0002 006a 7463 736c 0000 008e PACK...jtcsl.... 001af4e: 6262 6d63 0000 009a 5345 5244 0000 00a6 bbmc....SERD.... 001af5e: 4452 5652 0004 00b2 4344 4546 0001 00ee DRVR....CDEF.... 001af6e: 4b43 4852 0000 0106 4b4d 4150 0000 0112 KCHR....KMAP.... 001af7e: 4d42 4446 0000 011e 4d44 4546 0000 012a MBDF....MDEF...* 001af8e: 5744 4546 0001 0136 4355 5253 0003 014e WDEF...6CURS...N 001af9e: 464f 4e54 0004 017e 0005 ffff 5801 b122 FONT...~....X..\" 001afae: 0000 0000 0004 ffff 5801 c188 0000 0000 ........X....... 001afbe: 0007 ffff 5801 d348 0000 0000 0000 ffff ....X..H........ 001afce: 5801 d896 0000 0000 0000 ffff 5801 d924 X...........X..$ As of now we don’t know how to decode the structure, nor what %a0 points to when it is dereferenced into the global at 0xa78.

Regulator and anti-monopolist Rohit Chopra is pushing back. Matt Stoller Jun 22, 2024 301 Share this post Inside FICO and the Credit Bureau Cartel www.thebignewsletter.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 24 Share The attorney in a country town is as much a businessman as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis. - William Jennings Bryan, 1896 The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, coined the term ‘junk fee,’ and has begun restructuring how financial markets work, removing medical debt from credit reports, fostering competition in credit cards, and examining big tech’s entrance into payments. And yet, for ideological reasons, to many bankers, Chopra is a villain running a government agency full of bureaucratic demons, whose goal is to force them to do paperwork on behalf of nebulous ‘consumers.’ So it was a weird day last month when Chopra had a room full of mortgage bankers nodding their heads in furious agreement, and even angry at their own trade association for helping a monopoly take advantage of them. HousingWire’s James Kleimann and Sarah Wheeler were shocked, calling it “Must-See TV.” The Mortgage Bankers Association annual conference started with the typical attack on the government, with President and CEO Bob Broeksmit complaining about ‘regulatory knots’ while decrying government crackdowns on junk fees. CFPB Directors often attend these conferences to communicate with the industry, and the conversations aren’t always pleasant. This one didn’t seem like it would be pleasant either. But Chopra went on stage a few hours later and discussed an increasing cost center for banks, which is the credit bureaus and FICO. “Mortgage lenders in the U.S. increasingly face a lack of competition when it comes to accessing data and reports needed for loan origination,” he said. “In many cases, a handful of firms have cornered the market, allowing those companies to levy a tax on every mortgage application or transaction in the country.” Three firms dominate credit reporting: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. And just one company handles algorithms, the Fair Isaac Corporation, which sells the FICO score. “Mortgage lenders have shared that costs for credit reports and scores have increased,” he said. “Sometimes by 400% since 2022.” Chopra then went on to lay out some regulatory authority the CFPB has to impose price caps. The audience, surprisingly for a free market capitalist loving group of lenders, was eating it up. Why? Well it’s the same reason app developers hate Apple and Google, or cattle ranchers dislike JBS, or producers fear Netflix. The credit bureau cartel are gatekeepers to their market. And they are being squeezed, increasingly losing money on every mortgage they issue. Consumers pay for credit scoring, but they do so indirectly. When someone is thinking of buying a house, he or she visits a mortgage lender. That lender must buy a credit score from FICO and the bureaus to see what that person can afford. When a customer takes out a loan, that mortgage banker has to purchase another more complete report of credit information. Even if a lender thinks the customer would be a good risk, the lender has to buy a FICO score regardless. Mortgage bankers don’t carry the capital to hold the mortgages they make. Instead they make a loan, and then send it onward to the capital markets. First, the government guarantees most mortgages through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as other programs for veterans and first time homebuyers. Then, the government in turn sends these guaranteed mortgages to Wall Street. This complex process relies on a standard to price the loans, and that standard is FICO, combined with the credit information from the three bureaus. Mortgage bankers aren’t typical Wall Street bankers. While mortgage lending can be done by the big guys, real estate is an inherently localized industry with a clubby network of realtors, title insurers, and various other specialists in the home-buying process, so independent players have a strong foothold. There are roughly a thousand independent mortgage lending firms nationwide, and these lenders live everywhere. So their anger at FICO and the credit bureaus has an element of regional resentment, since they are not Wall Street traders, but are local community members trying to help people get homes. In January of 2024, the Community Home Lenders of America discussed this dynamic with FICO, calling it a utility, which it is. The “combination of FICO’s extremely high market share, and the fact that Washington agencies require lenders to use this company’s product, means that FICO has unilateral, solid-gold market power, the type rarely seen in any US industry short of highly regulated utilities, whereby rates are set by public-utility boards or commissions.” But the companies themselves know it and say it. In November 2011, then-CEO of Fair Isaac, Mark Greene, explained that the “network effect” of “FICO Scores . . . being sort of the standard language” and “having everybody . . . standardize on a FICO Score, that’s magic.” FICO sells 10 billion scores every year, four times the number of McDonald’s burgers and twice the number of Starbucks coffees sold annually. According to the company itself, nine out of ten lending decisions rely on FICO. Credit scoring used to cost a relatively small amount of money, but now it can be up to $60 per pull, with the price quadrupling over the last two years for no reason whatsoever. Only one out of every ten prospective customers ends up taking out a mortgage, so higher prices fronted by mortgage bankers add up. And it’s starting to be a major expense, driving some of the mortgage lenders out of the business entirely. In other words, Chopra, though disliked for calling out junk fees charged by bankers, was actually attacking a junk fee that mortgage bankers themselves have to pay. After his speech, Chopra and Broeksmit sat down for a public discussion, and Broeksmit pushed back on the criticism of FICO, which had led the price hike charge. And here’s where it got fascinating. Broeksmit was supposed to be representing the mortgage bankers in his association. But Chopra pointed out that, though it was a Mortgage Bankers Association event, the session itself was sponsored by FICO. “That was a wild moment right there,” recounted Wheeler on the HousingWire podcast. The head of the Mortgage Bankers Association, was being bribed by a monopolist to betray the bankers he was supposed to represent. And he was just called out for it. Credit Is Identity To understand the roots of this fight, we have to go back to the origins of credit reporting, which extend deep into American history. For 150 years, you could simply escape your debt by moving somewhere else, and adopting an entirely new identity. That’s the premise of the iconic American novel The Great Gatsby, the story of a mysterious East coast tycoon who has hidden his past. Today, The Great Gatsby couldn’t be written. Or if it were, it would be a one page story, in which someone runs a credit check on a rich liar named Jay Gatsby. In other words, national credit reports are foundational to modern American society, binding us to one another financially as a nation through a network of computerized records. And that national market of identity is relatively new. Until 1970, credit reporting was localized, mostly through coops of town bankers who hired detectives to investigate borrowers, collecting gossip from snitches about who drank too much, who was a Communist, who slept around, and so forth. As the book The Naked Society noted, bureaus looked at a consumer’s \"honesty, potentially dangerous habits, and manliness.\" Such information was kept in large paper files, it was secret, and it could often lead to someone never being able to get a job in a certain area, and they would never know why. A Gatsby was plausible, since you could escape your debts and your very identity by leaving one state and moving to another. Credit bureaus, like the FBI who collaborated with them, were creepy, with no limits on their data collection practices. And they saw themselves explicitly as disciplinarians. In 1968, leading credit bureau Retail Credit Corporation President Lee Burge told Congress that the “availability of record information imposes a discipline on the American citizen. He becomes more responsible for his performance whether as a driver of his car, as an employee in his job performance, or as a payor to his creditors. But this discipline is a necessary one if we are to enjoy the fruits of our economy and the present freedom of our private enterprise.” After a lot of complaints, Congress acted. In 1970, the only woman on the Banking Committee, Leonor Sullivan, collaborated with Rep. Wright Patman and Senator William Proxmire to write and pass the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This law eliminated the collection of the gossip, which often included information on race, gender, and sexuality. FCRA gave consumers a set of rights over their credit reporting files even though these files were held by private firms, and set limits on what data could be collected and how it could be used. No longer was it acceptable to take someone’s sex life and put it in a secret file, with that information leading to the inability to get a job for years. The new law treated the credit reporting bureaus as public utilities. FCRA was in a sense the last of the New Deal legal arrangements, passed at a moment of immense suspicion over government surveillance, part of a set of rules limiting the use of personal information by the Federal government and corporations. But FCRA also structured the national credit market, fostering the computerization of credit information nationwide, and designed to regulate the emerging industry of credit cards, which had picked up steam during the 1960s. “When a man walks into a bank to get a loan,” said a Bank of America executive in Congressional testimony, “he gives up a certain amount of privacy.” Now the bank’s ability to invade his privacy would be regulated and standardized, with the result that a loan could be done in a national market. The Gatsby era ended. There were two thousand credit bureaus across the U.S. when FCRA passed. By the 1990s, due to this law and to a relaxation of antitrust, they consolidated into three main firms, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These bureaus take advantage and encourage network effects to exclude rivals. They use a “give-to-get” rule, meaning that a lender that wants credit information to determine whether to offer a loan has to give data on its customers back to the credit bureaus in return for that information. The credit bureaus, fostered by regulatory choices and consolidation, were the first wave of big data firms, laying the groundwork for corporations like Google and Facebook years later. A different corporation, applies an algorithm to these credit bureau files to give each consumer a specific score, which is known as a FICO score. Having one number for a credit risk simplified lending and borrowing, especially as loans were split up into tranches and sold to Wall Street in large portfolios. In the 1990s, the government, through its various housing finance programs and entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, adopted FICO scores as a way to price mortgage loans. In many ways, FICO is the first artificial intelligence firm. By the 2000s, the credit bureaus and FICO organized the national credit market, especially when it came to home buying. These firms aren’t just private entities, but have become key parts of governance. If you want to verify someone’s work and income, for instance, or manage unemployment insurance claims at scale, you use one of these bureaus, most likely Equifax (which is the successor to the Retail Credit Corporation.) That firm recently bragged it signed a billion dollar contract with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, “over a billion dollars that had a price increase in it,” as well as “annual escalators.” Similarly, Experian is now running identity in our health care system with NCPDP/Experian Universal Patient Identifier. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, the first big data governance law, has been updated multiple times, expanding it to include data furnishers, allowing consumers to get free credit information, and moving regulatory enforcement of the law in 2010 from the Federal Trade Commission to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If you find an error in your report, you can ask for it to be corrected. However, one statutory flaw with the Fair Credit Reporting Act is that responsibility for errors rests with the consumer, not the bureau. Because of this, 44% of consumers who have looked at their credit reports found errors, which can cost credit, jobs, or government benefits. The Original Big Data The centralization of credit reporting and scoring had the effect of fostering market power among credit bureaus, which most consumers saw not in terms of cost, but in terms of quality and identity theft. In 2017, Equifax had one of the worst data breaches in history, one that led to Congress putting credit bureau CEOs on the hot seat in a hearing. It didn’t dent its market position, however. So even Patrick McHenry, the most favorable Wall Street Republican, criticized the bureaus. “There is no better example than the oligopoly that was created than the three that are sitting before us here today,” he said. “Our credit reporting system would be well-served by increased competition.\" The monetary cost not levied on consumers is paid by the lenders, employers, government, and other users of credit reports and identity services. And since completing a mortgage loan requires a FICO score from each one of the credit bureaus, what is known as a ‘trimerge,’ all three bureaus plus FICO have massive pricing power. FICO tends to lead the price increase, hiking its algorithm cost, which then allows credit bureaus to raise what they charge. These four firms are all doing quite well, which is odd, considering that mortgage lending is way down due to higher interest rates. FICO, for instance, offers amazing returns to investors. FICO’s CEO, Will Lansing, has noted publicly that his firm has “quite a bit of discretion in whether we want our margins to be higher or lower or where they are.” In 2023, its operating margin was 51%, and it spent just $159 million on research vs $407.3 million of stock buybacks. The three bureaus are benefitting as well. In the first quarter of this year Equifax CEO’s Mark Begor in a call with investors, talking about mortgage credit products stated: “Obviously, we take price up every year, which we did in 2024.” TransUnion’s CFO Ted Cello, similarly, in an investor call said “For 2024, we expect mortgage inquiries to be down roughly 5% and our revenues to increase roughly 25%, primarily” due to FICO’s pricing increase. And Experian CFO Lloyd Pitchford noted a “pricing benefit” from FICO’s price hikes. Mortgage volume at his firm collapsed by 30%, but revenue dropped by just 3%.

Subscribe To understand the market power involved, just look at FICO’s About page, which brags about having a monopoly. The Credit Bureau Wars But just because TransUnion, Equifax, Experian, and FICO all operate in a cartel-like arrangement doesn’t mean they have always been friendly. In 2006, the three credit bureaus decided they were tired of FICO’s position in the industry, and created a rival, called VantageScore, offering credit ratings for much cheaper than FICO and setting off a litigation war within the industry. FICO immediately sued, alleging an antitrust violation, and even trying to trademark the idea of giving credit scores between 300-850. Though they lost that suit in 2010, they continued litigation and political attacks, including hiring the Progressive Policy Institute in 2017 to write a pseudo-academic paper supporting their monopoly to fool policymakers. Still, the campaign worked. VantageScore never caught on in the mortgage lending part of credit scoring, instead serving as a cheap proxy for credit. When you see a free credit score on most sites, it’s usually not FICO, it’s VantageScore. In 2011, VantageScore partnered with the Consumer Federation of America, and tried to make the argument that its scores were better for low-income consumers, in the hopes that regulators would give them a place in the credit scoring world next to FICO. In 2013, VantageScore released its 3.0 model, which scored 30-35 million Americans who couldn’t get a FICO score. It differentiated medical debt, while FICO did not. VantageScore, though, served its purpose. In a complex set of lawsuits and negotiations from 2013 to 2018, FICO and the bureaus seemed to have come to a set of arrangements to jointly hike prices. Though contract terms are still confidential, some details have come out in an ongoing antitrust suit in Illinois by banks against FICO and the three bureaus. The claim is that the four firms are now a cartel. Contracts between FICO and the bureaus create a set of reciprocal obligations. The contracts include a “no equivalent product” clause that prohibits a credit bureau from developing or distributing a non-FICO analytic. It also includes a “dynamic royalty schedule” that allows FICO to charge seven times more if a lender uses a non-FICO score. In return, the bureaus all get the same price from FICO through a ‘level playing field’ clause, which means they know their costs are identical and so can coordinate pricing more easily. The net effect is that FICO ends up coordinating pricing in the industry. When FICO hikes prices, so do the credit bureaus. Equifax CEO Begor said in 2019 that when FICO “put through a price increase . . . Equifax[,] TU and Experian deliver[ed] that price increase to the marketplace, when they increase the price of their credit score. So that rolled through.” It’s not that hard to come up with a model for underwriting that is reasonably accurate; any bank with scale could probably do it. But FICO uses trade secrets, copyright, patents, or restrictive contracts to block anyone from doing so. A contact in the industry sent me a sample contract, which is full of absurd restrictions on the ability to use FICO scores. FICO prohibits not only validating different models against FICO scores, but even displaying FICO scores next to non-FICO scores. All of these tactics are an invitation to the Antitrust Division to investigate the industry, which it periodically has, most recently in 2020. And there’s another reason it’s impossible to move away from FICO - switching costs. FICO scores on top of a credit bureau file are baked into the operations of most banks and Wall Street buyers of mortgage bonds. One major lender, for instance, identified over 600 places it was using a FICO score in its business processes. Citibank undertook an 18 month operational review just to move to an updated FICO score. And when investors buy mortgage-backed securities, the FICO scores of the loans are a key mechanism to figure out how to price them. Banks hate change and risk, and a different credit scoring system introduces both. The Mortgage Rebellion Still, for the most part, the credit bureaus stayed off the radar, because the cost of a score had been low compared to the credit product. If you’re making a half a million dollar loan, who cares if you have to shell out $10 for a credit pull? The bureaus and FICO sell to a broad range of customers, including banking, insurance, retail, healthcare and the government. A little bit of cost for each of them isn’t a big deal, especially when they can pass those costs onward. But recently, that dynamic changed. In 2022, FICO announced a series of what would become an aggregate 500% price increase for the mortgage industry over the next two years. The reason is likely that the firm’s CEO, Will Lansing, had significant payment contingent on the stock price performance in 2023. And it worked, Lansing was the fifth highest paid CEO in America that year. And though FICO claims it doesn’t set the overall price for credit scores (though many in the industry are skeptical), its stock price reflected much higher margins. And a backlash began among their customers, notably mortgage lenders. It’s a bad time to be a mortgage lender, with high interest rates absolutely killing the mortgage market. A few years ago, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which runs most housing finance for the government through its control of secondary mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, decided that it might want to create some competition for FICO. So it turned to VantageScore. Only, it got backlash from Wall Street, which didn’t want to bother changing their models for mortgage backed securities. Instead of allowing mortgage lenders to pick either FICO or VantageScore, FHFA simply required that lenders use both. So now, instead of having to deal with one monopoly, mortgage lenders will have to deal with two, buying two scores appended to different credit bureaus. That made the whole industry mad. And then FICO began hiking prices, ostensibly to prepare for this new regime, but in reality simply because they could. The prospect of having to buy more credit scores at a higher price, all at a time when there are significantly fewer customers, has sent mortgage bankers into a frenzy. If nothing is done, mortgage bankers will have to ask customers upfront to pay for their own credit scoring, which will radically limit who can get a loan. There are additional problems. When a mortgage banker does a credit pull for a consumer, the credit bureau then puts that consumer on a list, and sells his data to other mortgage bankers. These ‘trigger leads’ annoy everyone; when you sign up for anything in real estate, you get a zillion calls and emails, because the bureaus sell your data. And the banker who paid for your credit report now has a lot of people calling to try and poach the customer whose credit report you already paid for. Moreover, consumers can’t reuse credit information; every mortgage banker has to order a new credit report and score for the same consumer, which is just more money transferred to FICO and the bureaus from the lender and consumer. Enter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau When Rohit Chopra spoke in front of mortgage bankers and lambasted FICO and the credit bureaus, he was pushing on an open door. He offered a creative interpretation of a dormant provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which included price caps for utility-style functions like credit reporting, “a fair and reasonable fee,” according to the law, when a consumer buys their credit information. The FTC never did much with this section, in the Bush era when the law was passed. It’s not a perfectly applicable legal tool; the law caps prices for what consumers pay, not lenders, but that’s a technical question that can be overcome. Chopra cited this law, and asked the industry to propose ideas “to address price gouging in this market.” Chopra mentioned another authority, which is the ability that the CFPB has to force financial entities to let consumers port their financial information from one entity to another. With a price cap and interoperability, consumers could take their credit score from one mortgage banker to another, without those bankers having to pay for a new credit pull each time. (As an aside, if you want to act on this problem, the CFPB recently opened a public comment docket for people to weigh in on what to do about these junk fees and asked the mortgage industry to add their thoughts. Individuals from the industry should weigh in, as the Mortgage Bankers Association is conflicted and cannot represent the industry effectively. The deadline for comments is August 6). There are other possible solutions. More competition would be good. In March, Senator Josh Hawley asked the Antitrust Division to investigate FICO again over its recent price hikes. It should, and that could encourage the firms to stop their aggressive gouging. There are also private suits; the current antitrust case against FICO is proceeding apace. In addition, the FHFA could change its poor decision, and allow mortgage lenders to pick either FICO or VantageScore, which would foster price competition among them. That would require some significant technical changes to how Fannie and Freddie package loans, but they can do that if they want. And then of course Congress could act, and either pass explicit price caps in this particular area, since FICO is clearly a utility, or force FICO to just let other entities use their algorithm so it faces competition. One of the more interesting dynamics in politics today is what happens when groups of business leaders collectively realize they are being subjected to a coercive monopoly. They often look around and start seeing what others are facing as well. Today, that’s happening among mortgage bankers. What’s particularly interesting is that those HousingWire reporters, who write about and are favorable to mortgage bankers, actually started to notice other consumer harms that Chopra highlighted about credit reporting, once they saw that consumers and bankers were in the same boat. Is there a broader lesson here? Well, it’s that in a sense, all of us who make money doing honest business or buying from honest businesses have an interest in the rule of law and assertive regulators. It’s not a coincidence that the people most sympathetic to the problems facing mortgage bankers is Rohit Chopra, an anti-monopolist consumer protection regulator, and Josh Hawley, a populist Senator. After all, who is the real threat to mortgage banking? The CFPB, who is trying to control the costs that they have to pay, and protect consumers at the same time? Or FICO and the credit bureau cartel, who are raising prices in the midst of collapsing demand? That’s a lesson being re-learned, in a broader sense, not just by mortgage bankers today, but by independent pharmacists, grocery store owners, farmers and ranchers, app developers, Hollywood producers, doctors, car repair shop owners, and anyone seeing their livelihood squeezed by a coercive middleman. Eventually, someone hits on either government regulation or antitrust, and then the conversations start. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “governments are instituted” in order to “to secure these rights” of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” These kinds of problems aren’t just something government can tackle, but why a free people build governments in the first place.

USAID also paid their legal departments to help draft a law which would govern the whole process. And guess what, in the result we got much fairer, more efficient, far more future-proof infra than the US has today. Gov licenses credit bureaus and runs its own one. Banks must report to all licensed bureaus and may choose which bureau to pull reports from. This means a report from any bureau is as good as from any other one. Having a gov player in the market effectively creates a price ceiling, so a private bureau has to sell data for less than the government-run bureau. Private bureau has to keep innovating to justify its existence and thus keep creating new products which predict creditworthiness better and better. Credit report includes all the raw information, so banks are free to compute their own score and are not bound to anything stupidly archaic and awkward such as US FICO score, don't need to rely on any external score at all. It is the XXI century, computing a credit decision out of a few hundred datapoints takes milliseconds, costs nothing. So gov-run bureau sees a fraction of a % of the load yet effectively moderates the whole market. The largest private bureau is owned by banks (like VISA used to be) and thus is working in the best interests of the banks. Many (if not all) problems we see in the US financial sector are the result of regulatory and legislative negligence.

However, requiring 100% of states to affirm the new constitution was difficult enough in 1776 when there were only 13 states and they all had a common enemy to band together against. Doing that now would probably be impossible or require antilogic so extreme no human could read it without their ears bleeding from the brain hemorrhage. reply Workaccount2 5 hours agoparentprevI think the idea is in good spirit, but it's important to be aware that gov backed services often run at a loss indefinitely.

They are their own government monopoly markets. If the government is going to become the defacto credit rating agency, they might as well be the defacto lender.

The credit union was content to use its own capital and hold your loan to maturity on its books.

Non-credit union lenders though most often want to either sell your loan to investors or pledge it as collateral to borrow money for themselves, and for that they need a FICO. > The score from what I have gathered when I learn really rewards those who remain in debt and pay substantial interest, not the frugal and financially stable (check to check is not financially stable). Basically encouraging to keep self in debt just at the edge of financial disaster's precipice. That's not really true. Using a credit card for most of your expenses and paying it off in full every month is actually a great boost to your credit score. It's both an indication that you live within your means and you honor your agreements. reply officeplant 4 hours agorootparentMeanwhile paying down my debt faster than I'm supposed to often leads to my score dropping a few points. I've also lost dozens of points for closing rarely used accounts to reduce my financial attack surface. It's all bullshit. I was in the mid 700's while struggling my ass off with debt only to drop into the high 600's for cleaning up my debt habits. reply ensignavenger 4 hours agorootparentRevolving accounts like credit cards using them each month and then paying them off is good for your score, fixed accounts like mortgages, car loans, etc, when you pay them down/off, the amount of credit you have drops with the balance, and once it is paid off the account is closed, so it actually drops your score. If you don't use a credit card (and increasingly for me, if I don't use a card enough) the issuer will likely close the account or reduce your available credit, which will reduce your credit score... So yeah, it is a pain in the rear to maintain a very high credit score. reply hnburnsy 4 hours agoparentprevMost government securitized backed mortgage loans (which has 70% of the market) require a credit pull.

But, at some point, you absolutely do not need to be in debt to have a good credit score. I guess technically, if you use credit cards and pay them off every month without paying any interest, you're in debt all the time but that's not what most people mean by \"debt.\" reply stevekemp 4 hours agoparentprevI guess from a certain point of view you're right, a credit score is a list of all the debts you've had an how you've paid them back. So somebody with no debt is \"unknown\", rather than the expected \"good\". In Finland we don't have credit scores, instead we allow looking up defaults. Which seems like a reasonably sane approach - known-bad borrowers find it hard to repeat that behaviour, and somebody with no history of taking loans/debts isn't penalized. reply buzer 4 hours agorootparent> In Finland we don't have credit scores, instead we allow looking up defaults. There is also the newly established The Positive credit register which contains list of all of your debts.

There is certainly a component of risk in the models but there’s also “how valuable a credit consumer are you”. Which is why things like closing accounts or paying loans early actually hurt your score. CRAs and their advocates say “we lost a datapoint so our uncertainty increases”, acting as if that historical data has no value. When I was applying for a mortgage and my credit was as “clean” as it has been (balances, accounts, etc.) Verizon filed a collection over what was a fraudulent account. Score dropped 140 points. In the course of three business days that collection was deleted, and my score went back up… 50 points. Multiple factors, I know, but that also makes me think that even some of those deleted trade lines and delinquencies and others are still floating around and factoring in. reply simfree 5 hours agoparentprevA good credit union will bring loans to the board of trustees and often approve them when no Bank will.

Of all the fees associated with buying your average $400k home, I don't think the $150 credit check fee is the big pain point. Title insurance is a much bigger scam/cost.

How does a government database help in this case? This is a scenario that happens more often than you'd think with empty condos and a foreign owner who isn't around to look after their property. You'd still need title insurance even though you have a \"government maintained database\" reply flerchin 1 hour agorootparentThat scenario is in fact not covered by title insurance. Title insurance would be for the schmuck who bought your house.

E.g. a central registry of ownership and liens would probably solve 99% of the cases that you need insurance for. The insurance is a scam in the way that there are technical solutions that would obviate the need for this \"service\", but that solution is against the interests of the service providers. Very much like tax returns, which are a solved problem in many countries for the majority of the population because the authorities already have all the data they need. Most people should not need to faff around with them. In the US however, the tax return lobby is strong and effectively prevents the government from making it easy... reply JackFr 5 hours agorootparentIn those cases where the government handles recording all transfer, there is typically a fund which covers loss due to fraudulent or erroneous transfers.

In my case, I had a (resolved) issue where the property/house I was buying was a subdivided larger property with an agricultural lien (for an apple orchard) that hadn't been lifted yet. Titles have a lot of opportunities for complications in many places; there's no simple technology fix. The insurance is annoying but it's an area that has the potential for really expensive issues. reply vel0city 5 hours agorootparentI'm definitely no expert on the law in every state, but from the states I know of there are central appraisal districts in charge of real estate tax appraisals. They already have to keep track of ownership of properties and their tax assessments, might as well just expand their domain to also include lien registries as well. I totally get it would be quite a mess and complication and issue with federalism to have the federal government have a single database, but at least having real databases somewhere that can be publicly queried would be a massive step forward towards making title insurance no longer a thing. reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentI'm not opposed to the idea but someone needs to hold the bag when mistakes are made and then you're essentially back to having title insurance in some form even if it's the general taxpayer that is doing the funding. reply vel0city 4 hours agorootparentA large part of the cost of title insurance is because the current system of tracking such things is such a massive mess. If you massively reduce the likelihood of issues cropping up by having actually good systems in place, you don't need to hire the teams of people to actually look into the properties and find the irregularities and end up still missing things from time to time. Just query the database. Are there any liens registered? No? It is clear then. Anyone that failed to properly file it in the database is just out of luck. Insurance on something that constantly sees catastrophe is far more expensive than insurance on something that rarely ever sees problems. reply mschuster91 3 hours agorootparentprev> I'm not opposed to the idea but someone needs to hold the bag when mistakes are made Well, that's obvious: the local authority in charge of record keeping. reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentSo, no, it's not obvious. Where I live that would be some combination of the county and the the town, given the Registrar of Deeds is a county position and things like property tax and liens are handled at the town level. And the county really just handles some legal matters and doesn't collect any taxes so that sort of means the state. To quote a previous comment it's all a bit of a mess. \"All\" you need to do is revamp property record keeping across the US and title insurance would be less of a big deal. reply mschuster91 2 hours agorootparentThe US has a lot of historical baggage that desperately needs a thorough cleanup. There should not be two (or more) \"sources of truth\" for things affecting a property or alternatively, notaries, lawyers or whatever y'all use to deal with transferring real estate should be mandated to warn their clients if there is more than one place where records are kept. reply splwjs 5 hours agoparentprevLast time I looked at the amortization schedule for a 30 year fixed mortgage the payback was about 250% of the loan amount. No other figures are consequential. Mortgages are a predatory thing pointed at the financially illiterate and the hopeless right now. reply neogodless 5 hours agorootparentThis is a pretty limited view of mortgages. In varies across countries, but in the U.S. a (relatively) low APR fixed rate 30 year mortgage is an amazing way to utilize leverage (only put up ~20% collateral) on an appreciating asset. Paying $400,000 for a mortgage vs paying $80,000 and 6% over 30 years, but investing the remaining $320,000 in the stock market (returning ~7% after inflation) and your housing payment grows much slower than inflation. That doesn't mean every mortgage is a good idea, or there aren't circumstances where the borrower ends up losing out, but it's a tool that can be utilized if you learn to understand it. reply exabrial 5 hours agoprevI'm not sure how many times we're going to re-learn this lesson: * You cannot regulate a monopoly into good behavior.

Open Banking is gaining traction, in Canada a new law called the Consumer Driven Banking Act was just enacted that aligns with UK Open Banking model. While the legislation does not explicitly call out open source credit model, the legislative frameworks are being setup that align with open source model. The government mandate is: \"to establish a framework within which consumers, including small businesses, can direct that their data be shared among participating entities of their choice and to ensure that the sharing of data among participating entities is safe and secure.\" While the mandate does not call out the implementation method, this could be conceived as open source credit.

Also current job and income and how long there. reply jon-wood 5 hours agorootparentAt least in the UK this is done as well as pulling your credit score, traditionally it's not a factor feeding into your credit score. Banks check both your history of paying off debts and your ability to continue doing so, it doesn't matter how good your score is, if you ask for an unsecured loan that's 20x your annual income over the next 5 years it's going to get refused. This is all somewhat complicated by recent products from credit agencies, which make use of the Open Banking standard to pull data direct from your bank accounts and use that data to feed into credit scoring as well. reply Dalewyn 9 hours agorootparentprevPretty much, yeah. A credit score is a descriptor of the risk of financial loss when lending the individual concerned some money. So the only real way to grow and keep the score high is: * Pay your credit card and loan statements when they are due (late payments imply you don't have money). * Keep credit inquiries to the minimum necessary (an inquiry means you're asking for a loan, implying you don't have money). * Don't max out your credit limits if possible (you're taking and maxing out lines of credit, implying you don't have money). * Keep old credit cards open even if you don't use them, if it's practical (a longstanding open line of credit implies you have money). * Keep doing all of the above for many years (a good credit score implies you have money and will pay back debts incurred). There's no magic or mystery to it, it just takes a lot of time to grow and keep high because you're building and maintaining trust with banks. You know that old saying? Trust is built over years but destroyed in a second? Yeah. reply ykonstant 9 hours agorootparentMore than half of the above don't imply that you don't have money.

What in tarnation. This entire charade is a grotesque dance of mad clowns. reply akira2501 9 hours agorootparent> can lead to maxing out while being perfectly comfortable financially. Total credit usage can have an impact. So if all your lines of credit are at maximum, this is a negative signal. If one or more is, but your total utilization is 75% or less, it should have little to no impact. This is why the installment loan part is useful. It starts at maximum balance and you immediately pay that down. It's not as strong of a positive signal until you hit payoff but it's a pretty massive one the day you do. reply Dalewyn 9 hours agorootparentprev>Lack of money is only one of the possible reasons for those situations. As far as a lender is concerned, if you don't pay back your debts you might as well not have money even if you actually do. >Entities with tons of money seek loans all the time for liquidity and risk mitigation. And each and every one of those inquiries will lower your credit score, because you're taking on more debt. Do you have money? Will you pay the debt back? The more inquiries there are (the more you ask for loans) in a given span of time, the less likely it is you have money and will pay debts back. >Nope, lack of understanding how CC scoring works (scoring designed to keep you in the credit mill) can lead to maxing out while being perfectly comfortable financially. Banks hate seeing lines of credit maxed out. Ask any banker worth his salt and they will all tell you the same. If it wasn't obvious already, banks don't like lending money. That might sound strange, but for a bank (the lender) a loan is an investment and investments are risks. The more loans (debt) someone has, the more risk they are carrying and thus their credit score will reflect that. >What in tarnation. A line of credit in good standing that has been open for a long time means you've been making your payments properly, meaning the risk of lending money to you is lower than someone who does not have a line of credit as old. Thus, your credit score will be higher. The age of your credit is usually determined by your oldest open line(s) of credit. Closing an old line of credit means it will eventually fall off your credit report and stop being reflected in your credit score, which will fall to reflect the new and younger age of your credit. Again: Everything about credit score is solely about the risk you might pose to a lender. Anything that increases that risk will lower the score, and vice versa, even if it's just an implication. reply worstspotgain 8 hours agorootparent> banks don't like lending money Not quite. If you're not lending money someone else has deposited, you're not a bank. Banks have to lend money. Problems arise when they lend too much or lend badly. If we want to spitball, we don't really need banks. In the age of computers, the central bank could take on their ledger function without breaking a sweat. It could then contract out the lending and deposit functions separately. The deposit function is trivial. All deposit institutions would be 100% trustworthy. They'd just basically be ATMs for your account at the Fed. The lending function is slightly hairier. The Fed would set risk parameters and performance-based revenue sharing. The lenders would have one client to please, and would be barred from many of the shenanigans they do today. However, they'd have a rent-seeking incentive. reply bux93 5 hours agorootparentprevInquiries impact your credit score negatively not because you took on more credit, but because you (most likely) didn't. The correlation is that if you get rejected by lender A, and try a new application at lender B, and again at lender C, you will have a lot more inquiries than some-one who got credit extended at the first try. FICO don't know if you actually got rejected, or if you were just checking rates, nor do they know what the reason for rejecting you was (maybe they don't even serve your area but their funnel doesn't filter on that early enough) - they just know you were checked. This particular one is a bit iffy, my bank's UI essentially tricked me into a credit check. Then again, all of them are quite iffy and based on a few datapoints that FICO has access to, which omits many of the things you'd look at during any kind of manual underwriting. reply matwood 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's not about having/not having money, it's about propensity to pay. Obviously, people need money to pay, but someone can have all the money in the world and still default on loans by not paying. reply Workaccount2 4 hours agorootparentThis is an edge illogical case. Like technically you can sell your apple shares for $5/share, but no broker even has the functionality to let you voluntarily take a loss.

For example, I know my score swings by +/-30 points/month.

And so there is a lot more money and effort invested in developing pharmaceutical and treatment solutions than there is in preventing the problems they treat – even though that would be far, far better for society as a whole. Alternatively/additionally, the stakeholders that make money treating things (insurance companies, hospitals, etc.) are simply larger and better capitalized than those that make money preventing health problems (gyms, health food stores, etc.) The biggest gym or fitness company in the world is probably minuscule in comparison to the average medical company. The only wrinkle in my understanding here is that as far as I know, insurance rates are lower for healthy people, and thus doctors(?) are somewhat incentivized to have healthier patients. Is there a market-based solution to this? And if so, what would it look like? Tax breaks for gyms? More lobbying from Big Gym? reply CalRobert 9 hours agoparentWell, one clear market-based solution would be pricing transportation appropriately. If people were allowed to not pay for car infrastructure (via parking minimums, restrictive zoning, taxpayer-funded highways, etc. et.) and take their bike and train instead there would be a strong price signal to encourage the healthier activity. I moved to the Netherlands a year ago and have already lost 9kg (about 20 pounds) without really even trying that hard. I just don't have a car. It's even more baffling we don't do this because this is cheaper AND healthier. If the same organisation is paying for health care and transport (like a national government) than it should be a blindingly obvious solution. reply jiriknesl 9 hours agorootparentThis policy would be too unrelated to health.

Our current tax policy actively disincentivizes this - literally collecting _less_ tax could result in better health outcomes if it meant narrower, safer streets (which are cheaper to build and maintain), less parking (parking spots can cost tens of thousands of USD/EUR depending on where they are, and more insidiously, often displace housing), etc. reply sufehmi 8 hours agorootparentprevPublic policies are designed to work on populations, massive number of people - not anecdotal evidences like these.

One of the worst things that ever happened to pharmaceutical industry profits was the the discovery that most ulcers can be cheaply cured with antibiotics (which won the discovers a well deserved Nobel prize). Even after this ulcer drugs were hugely profitable. I cannot remember the numbers from when I was an analyst covering them (more than 20 years ago!), but at one point a very big proportion (maybe even most) of Astrazeneca's profits came from their blockbuster ulcer treatment. Imagine how much more profitable that would be without a cheap cure around! Gyms are not the solution, nor are health food stores. Far more people join gyms than make use of them. You can keep fit going for walks or running or a multitude of cheap things. IMO the problems are lack of time for exercise and money for a healthy diet. Poor people have a far worse diet than rich people because they have to fill up with cheap junk. Junk food takes less time to prepare. I have ready meals sometimes because I am tired. Some people have to do it all the time, and they do not have the money to be fussy about how healthy the meals are. reply johnnyanmac 10 hours agorootparent>the problems are lack of time for exercise and money for a healthy diet. pretty much. You go to some circles that will keep swearing by \"Calories in, Calories out\", and blaming any detteral of this as laziness. It's basically the equivalent of saying \"stop smoking\" to a smoker. Yes, they are objectiely right, but also miss all the subtlety of the steps needed to \"stop smoking\". Time is definitely the biggest factor, and modern society feels like it's demanding more time than ever of workers for less spending power than ever.

I pity the smoker more because they don’t have to smoke but feel compelled to smoke through addiction.

Be it for comfort or habit. Hormones and neurotransmitters drive behavior.

Because I’ve quit a pack-a-day-for-ten-years nicotine addiction, and I’ve dieted by slightly increasing exercise and slightly decreasing caloric consumption to produce a daily deficit of about 250-500 calories in line with mainstream medical recommendations, and I can tell you which I found harder… and it wasn’t drinking diet soda and walking around the block in the morning. reply graemep 5 hours agorootparentprev> I pity the smoker more because they don’t have to smoke but feel compelled to smoke through addiction. We all feel compelled to eat. A lot of cheap food does not satisfy hunger for as long as better food. Just cutting calories in can make you feel less able to do things, so you automatically cut back on exercise. People differ in many ways: metabolism, genetics, physical sicknesses, mental health, gut bacteria and probably many more things I cannot think of will change how the same diet affects different people, and their ability to exercise. reply dbspin 9 hours agorootparentprevThe cost of diet point is absolutely true. I'm a writer and filmmaker living in Europe - i.e.: poor. I've also got a variety of food intolerances and health issues, which compound over time. To help with stomach and sleep issues I'm currently trying to eat only foods I cook from scratch: mostly fish, meat and veg and a little fruit. It's wildly more expensive (and time consuming) than cooking prepackaged food.

Carbs are one aspect of diet. There's very little actual nutrition in any of those things. reply dbspin 4 hours agorootparentYes, that's my point... It's cheaper to eat poorly. It's (significantly) more expensive to eat well. As I said before I'm spending more than twice as much cooking from scratch. And (as I'm coeliac and intolerant of milk) I wasn't eating the cheapest food before by any means. I reckon here in Dublin, the cheapest (and extremely unhealthy) diet of oven chips, pasta, bread etc - could be had for well under 20 euro per person per week.

I do minimal high intensity exercise every single day, it is just routine, because I am busy. Everyone can learn that.

But likewise if your day to day is hard, stressful and has a decent amount of worry then once you’ve got the kids to bed at 8:30 the will power required to do some exercise is monumental. Quite frankly their will power points are gone for the day.

For example, each town has a swimming pool, used by kids and adults alike, with very cheap membership.

Unlike the food industry which directly causes the issue by pushing addictive and unhealthy food, I suspect the underlying problem with treatment vs. prevention is in culture and mentally. You need to convince people to spend a significant portion of time exercising and eating healthy when they do not yet have issues in order to prevent future issues, taking time away from other, more entertaining things. Even with a goal, exercise is hard work. Treatment on the other hand rarely requires significant effort, and once it is needed it is no longer something you can ignore and postpone like you could with prevention. At the same time, many conditions which pharma develops treatment for are not fixed with exercise. reply vmfunction 10 hours agoparentprev>There is more money to be made by stakeholders treating health problems than there is in preventing them.

And I can tell that the rest of my system just works better when I'm working out regularly: I have fewer hunger attacks, I sleep better, I feel better. And, I just really like the feeling of picking up really heavy things (that being my current exercise of choice). From what I can tell, the \"exercise sucks\" barriers most people face are 1) not everybody likes everything, and 2) it takes at least 2 months of training to get to the point where you can get the taste for the endorphins without being overly sore afterwards. Now maybe you've spent 2 months trying all kinds of different activities (swimming, walking, hiking, weight lifting, cycling, wrestling, football) and none of them have worked, in which case fair enough. But if you haven't, I'd recommend trying it. I can see why if you're overweight that running wouldn't be very fun. If you haven't tried weight lifting, definitely give that a go. If you're overweight, you've got a head start lifting heavy things (you), so it shouldn't be as hard to get into. People who've never lifted weights have this idea that it's mind-numbingly boring; but the mental focus you need to lift heavy things is actually a bit more like meditation. And being able to confidently lift really heavy things is an amazing feeling, not to mention having pumped-up muscles. reply red-iron-pine 55 minutes agorootparent> Lots of people, including myself, love exercising. great, good for you and those people. but clearly most people don't. plus you cannot out-exercise a poor diet. doesn't matter how hard you go in the gym or on a hike if you slam donuts and pepsi all day. reply keiferski 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you probably just need to find a form of exercise that you enjoy. For me, I really don't like going to the gym, but I do enjoy biking. That aside, exercise is just one aspect of prevention. In most places that have lower obesity rates, people probably exercise less than they do in America, which is ironic. My broader point is more that the system is set up in such a way that it's easier for you to get overweight and then pay $8K a year to buy a treatment drug, than to just help you avoid getting overweight in the first place. Probably because the cost to do that is much less than $8K, so the stakeholders are much less incentivized to do it. reply fifticon 10 hours agorootparentprevAs countless others have replied, those of us that enjoy exercise feel like something is off here :-). I may be wrong, but my impression is that it is like driving a car with flat tires. Yes, that feels wrong, but once you inflate those tires, driving the car no longer feels wrong. At times when I have been out of shape, it has felt taxing to start up. But as soon as my shape starts to tighten up, it no longer feels like misery at all, instead it feels like the privilege getting to drive around in a cool machine - your very own body. It may be this is fundamentally different between types of people. For example, I have heard many women claim that running never felt good to them, even when they were in shape (this might there be related to how hips may be differently shaped for running). reply Moldoteck 9 hours agorootparentprev\"Exercise sucks. I am overweight.\" - to beat the weight problem exercise will do little. It's mostly what you eat. Exercise is for muscles, shape, health, blood pressure and many other great stuff and sometimes for weight loss, but generally exercise is not a good way to lose weight, in fact it can boost the hunger feeling and you could eat more calories without noticing. Ozempic is good for weight loss (with some risks but it's a great tool) and if combined with shaping good food habits - eventually you can drop the ozempic and keep the weight, and when weight is good, exercise is much easier (but still sucks for many). Some do prefer to bike as a form of exercise that's both healthy and greatly improves leg muscles which can help if joints were destroyed when the person was overweight. But ozempic will not help with health problems related to lack of exercise and sedentary life, it'll help just for weight(and sometimes addiction) loss.

Hell, it's so so much easier to stick with it if it isn't miserable. I always tell new runners to slow down, like ridiculously slow, laughably slow. If it feels like the lung is burning and you want to vomit, oh that is wayyyyy too fast. Keep it slow and steady and maybe only ever so slightly uncomfortable, then allow your body to adapt and ride that feeling until you're all of the sudden exercising much harder but without feeling like you do.

My BMI was 38 and I was in horrible shape. People told me I needed to go to the gym, take up running, etc. - and that advice, while well-meaning, was mostly bad. For me, what I needed was to swim and bike more. I loved those things. Running hurt and was miserable. Weight lifting was horrible. Team sports were a misery. But I could happily bike (on a recumbent in particular) for ages, at my own pace. When I sold my car, started riding a bike everywhere, and started a volumetric diet (don't eat tiny meals, eat big ones of low-calorie-density foods) I dropped to about 200 pounds.

Money put into youth sports, mandatory gym classes, amateur athletics as their own carveout for nonprofit activity. Lyndon Johnson launched the presidential fitness challenge in 1966. Michelle Obama tried to make this her entire pet project for 8 years while her husband was in office. Other parts of the Internet are full of people like the greyed out comment making the exact opposite observation to yours. They complain that doctors don't take them seriously or give them medicine, refuse surgeries if you're overweight, and are always prescribing diet and exercise. For what it's worth, and I guess it doesn't have to be worth much, my personal hobbies outside of work have always consisted of sports and fitness. I was into these things well before I ever discovered my first computer. One consequence is most of the informational/entertainment content I consume is sports and fitness focused, including a few podcasts hosted by both coaches and medical doctors, who also make the same counterarguments to your own observation here. Every major medical association out there, national and international standards bodies, primary care physicians themselves, do in fact prescribe preventive measures like diet and exercise, but either the patients and general population ignore these and don't do it anyway, or they don't seek any sort of remedy until they're too far gone in the first place. There are clearly plenty of environmental factors causing higher levels of diseases of civilization, ranging from the accessibility of sports and recreation facilities in particular places to a poor walking environment to food abundance, but it certainly isn't just this. Plenty of nobility of old got fat eating minimally processed, locally grown foods that their ancestors ate, before cars and concrete existed. We can see the same thing happening to our own pets. They're seeing elevated rates of obesity and hypertension and stuff you'd never see in the wild, and this happens even when they're fed great food and allowed every opportunity to exercise. The unfortunate reality is evolution equipped mammals with an incredible propensity to conserve energy and overeat when the opportunity to do so is available, presumably because such an environment would have largely been seasonal and not permanent in the distant past. We've made it permanent. I'm not at all trying to say that we can't do anything society-wide. There are obvious differences between nations and regions. There have to be reasons some places do better than others, but I doubt that market forces are one of those things because those are largely the same everywhere, and the entire world has seen diseases of civilization pop up as soon as people have the chance to overeat and live sedentary lives. Hacker News really hates this for some reason, but things like GLP-1 agonists are going to be necessary if you really want to hit everyone that is affected by this. A whole lot of people simply are not going to eat less and move more no matter what incentives you give them. reply mahdi7d1 9 hours agoparentprevThere is no solution. The problem is not in the lack of funding or interest from investors. The public itself is not interested in preventing. They think the probability of something bad happening for them is low (for example heart attack) thus they are not willing to put in the effort and proactively try to prevent it (for example by exercising). This can be either from a lack of accurate data or even when the data is accurate and available someone might still interpret it differently. For me a 3 percent chance might be insignificant for someone else 1 percent is still high. reply alwillis 9 hours agorootparent> The public itself is not interested in preventing. They think the probability of something bad happening for them is low Which is ironic because we all know someone who’s had a heart attack, cancer or a stroke. And if someone decides to make lifestyle changes, they’re often going against society and the medical establishment. A friend recently was able to stop taking her diabetes and hypertension meds after she did things her doctors discouraged her from doing, like intermittent fasting, which I told her about. Now she distrusts doctors because they told her she’d have take these meds for the rest of her life. reply personalityson 10 hours agoprev\"Scientists researching possible candidates for treating Alzheimer's disease found exercise outperformed all tested drugs for the ability to reverse dysregulated gene expression.\" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22179-z \"High fitness in middle age reduces the chance of dementia by ninety percent\" https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180315101805.h... reply nabla9 9 hours agoprevDifference is just 5.8 per 1000 person-years. The effect size is very modest. You spend more time in exercising than increase your lifespan. The metaphor is literal, you are running from death and disease, and death is running faster. What we need is review studies ranking lifestyle and health regimes by their effect size and combined effect sizes. Almost certainly combining two effective regimes increases the life- and healthspan more than their sum. Whatever you do, the effect likely is probably just 5 years of healthspan (relative to your generation). Wild guess: Body weight, proper nutrition, exercise, no stress, no smoking or alcohol and controlling inflammation in the body other ways, like dental hygiene[1] is the best you can do.

It's also misery to shuffle around and wheeze through every minute of your life. Exercise improves sleep, improves cognitive function and make tasks easier and more enjoyable. Everything about your life improves. I bicycle, and I enjoy it.

My cognitive function is down for extended periods of time after prolonged exercise. I see no effect on exercising vs my life enjoyability except immediately after exercise I feel happy, because that torture is over and I can resume thinking. reply nabla9 7 hours agorootparentprevGood for you. But this is not about you. I feel the same, but this is not about me. For people who read this and don't exercise, may not feel it enjoyable, it's often uphill all the time. They don't like exercise. Maybe being just thin and losing weight would be better, or doing non-vigorous exercise. We don't have much information. We make stories going off the tangent on some studies. reply pengaru 4 hours agorootparentEverybody feels better when healthy, and worse when sick. Viewing this topic purely through years of life extension is severely flawed. reply swat535 4 hours agoparentprevYour assertion here is that the lifespan of a healthy person and one of the unhealthy individual is the same. They are not. The healthy person has less stress, sleeps better, has better sex, has better mood and energy and isn't spending most of his life having difficulty dealing with illnesses steaming from unhealthy habits. Additionally, the time spend exercising isn't wasted, it's quiet enjoyable thanks to the release of Endorphins. Not to mention that it helps build muscles and keeps your body in shape which makes you more attractive to the opposite sex, thus increasing the chances of finding a partner. You also get all the cognitive benefits mentioned in the article for free. To top if it off, the time commitment isn't 8 hours a day. It only requires an hour every 2 days or so (it varies depending on what you're trying to accomplish). I highly recommend it. reply danielbln 5 hours agoparentprevIt think it's important to differentiate between life expectancy and quality of life. If you're a tub of good and sedentary, you might spend the last 10% of your life trapped in a failing body, which can very much tank your quality of life, whereas the fit person might actually be able to enjoy the golden years. I feel that's something that often is overlooked when talking about pure life expectancy. reply sgt101 9 hours agoprevI have only had a quick look, but I think that this is suss because of the VPA definition. The authors could show us the data vs. response to the questionnaire, in particular the columns for folks doing >5 episodes of high intensity exercise per week... but they don't and instead simply show the categories >1per week andWhen we say ‘vigorous’ we mean activities that make you sweat, increase your heart rate or increase your breathing. Please think about vigorous activities that you may have done at home or at places of work other than your home, as well as vigorous recreational activities or conditioning exercises.

Correlation != Causation Could the causation conceivably run the other direction? People with beginning dementia exercise less? Yes, that is quite conceivable actually. Could there be a common cause explaining both? Yes, if you are in good health, with good genes, a good job, leisure time and money, then probably you are the type of person who'll live longer, sport more, and be cognitively healthy for a longer time. It doesn't mean the causality runs in the other direction. In other words, this study shows what we all know. The 'good' people have all the good stuff. But what we want to know, will an intervention that causes people to exercise more do any good? reply thefz 10 hours agoparentSometimes I wonder if commenters in this forum will do anything to try to disprove that exercise is good for health. reply alephnerd 9 hours agorootparentThere is an undercurrent of skepticism and contrarianism bordering on anti-intellectualism on this forum - especially with those accounts started after the pandemic. This is just one of dozens of studies that have shown that good cardiovascular health (a side effect of \"vigorous\" exercise) has a downstream positive effect on health. And I personally can attest to that - the days I don't vigorously exercise (run, swim, BJJ, MT) are also the days I see the biggest cognitive declines - and I'm fairly young. reply cheschire 8 hours agorootparentThis should be quantifiable. Use an LLM to help identify this undercurrent you’re referring to in maybe 10,000 conversation threads using the API from the footer. A thread being a reply to a topic, and a singular chain of replies. Then use that to train an RNN for sentiment analysis based on the values you’ve just described. Then run the entire HN corpus through your RNN and chart the values over time. For bonus points, incorporate the score of replies in the weighting of values. reply alephnerd 3 hours agorootparentYou don't need an LLM for sentiment analysis.

Many \"skinnyfat\" (no muscle, no fat) people don't like to move, and there are lots of muscular people that enjoy exercising. Is that a function of bodyfat percentage? I doubt so as well. Ideal BF% in men goes from 8 to 20%, when I see lots of people above 20% in the trails or running/cycling around. Besides, if the goal is weight loss, that can be achieved with caloric restriction and zero minutes of cardio. It's thermodynamics. Move for the sake of it, not for weight loss. reply Moldoteck 9 hours agoparentprev [–] exercise in most cases will not help you getting fit, you are most likely to have a greater appetite after exercising.
