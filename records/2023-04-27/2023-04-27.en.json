    "content": "METROPOLISThe Glorious Return of a Humble Car FeatureAutomakers are starting to admit that drivers hate touchscreens. Buttons are back!BY DAVID ZIPPERAPRIL 26, 202312:34 PMThe 2024 Porsche Cayenne. The 2023 model had touchscreens on the steering wheel. PorscheTWEETSHARECOMMENTYou don\u2019t see a lot of good news about road safety in the United States. Unlike in most peer countries, American roadway deaths surged during the pandemic and have barely receded since. Pedestrian and cyclist fatalities recently hit their highest levels in 40 years, but U.S. transportation officials continue to ignore key contributing factors. In a February interview with Fast Company, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that \u201cfurther research\u201d is needed before addressing the obvious risks that oversized SUVs and trucks pose to those not inside of them.Happily, there is one area where we are making at least marginal progress: A growing number of automakers are backpedaling away from the huge, complex touchscreens that have infested dashboard design over the past 15 years. Buttons and knobs are coming back.ADVERTISEMENTThe touchscreen pullback is the result of consumer backlash, not the enactment of overdue regulations or an awakening of corporate responsibility. Many drivers want buttons, not screens, and they\u2019ve given carmakers an earful about it. Auto executives have long brushed aside safety concerns about their complex displays\u2014and all signs suggest they would have happily kept doing so. But their customers are revolting, which has forced them to pay attention.For well over a decade, touchscreens have spread like a rash across dashboards. As with other dangerous trends in car design (see the steering yoke), this one can be traced back to Tesla, which has for years positioned its vehicles as \u201ctablets on wheels.\u201d As a result, touchscreens were seen as representing tech-infused modernity. But cost has been a factor, too. \u201cThese screens are presented as this avant garde, minimalist design,\u201d said Matt Farah, a car reviewer and host of The Smoking Tire, an auto-focused YouTube channel and podcast. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s the cheapest way possible of building an interior.\u201d Although they look fancy, Farah said that carmakers can purchase screens for less than $50, making them significantly less expensive than tactile controls.As I explained in a 2021 Slate article, the trend toward car touchscreens has been a dangerous one for road safety. Those who drove in the 1990s will remember using buttons and knobs to change the radio or adjust the air conditioning without looking down from the steering wheel. Despite their name, touchscreens rely on a driver\u2019s eyes as much as her fingers to navigate\u2014and every second that she is looking at a screen is a second that she isn\u2019t looking at the road ahead. Navigating through various levels of menus to reach a desired control can be particularly dangerous; one study by the AAA Foundation concluded that infotainment touchscreens can distract a driver for up to 40 seconds, long enough to cover half a mile at 50 mph.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThe irony is that everyone basically accepts that it\u2019s dangerous to use your phone while driving,\u201d said Farah. \u201cYet no one complains about what we\u2019re doing instead, which is fundamentally using an iPad while driving. If you\u2019re paying between $40,000 and $300,000 for a car, you\u2019re getting an iPad built onto the dashboard.\u201dSeeking to address these risks, NHTSA published voluntary guidance in 2013 recommending that a driver be able to complete any infotainment task with glances of under two seconds, totaling a maximum of 12 seconds. But NHTSA\u2019s guidance had no enforcement mechanism, and carmakers have violated it with impunity.In the last two years further evidence has suggested that touchscreens represent a step backward for auto design. Drexel researchers found that infotainment systems posed a statistically significant crash risk even in the early 2010s, before carmakers added many of today\u2019s bells and whistles. A widely publicized Swedish study found that completing tasks with screens takes longer than with physical buttons.Meanwhile, a revolt has been brewing. A recent J.D. Power consumer survey on vehicle dependability concluded that \u201cinfotainment remains a significant issue for new vehicles.\u201d It wasn\u2019t hard to understand why. In a 2022 New York Times opinion piece titled \u201cTouch Screens in Cars Solve a Problem We Didn\u2019t Have,\u201d Jay Caspian Kang wrote, \u201cI can think of no better way of describing the frustration of the modern consumer than buying a car with a feature that makes you less safe, doesn\u2019t improve your driving experience in any meaningful way, saves the manufacturer money and gets sold to you as some necessary advance in connectivity.\u201dOther stories railing against car touchscreens ran in newspapers like the Los Angeles Times and tech sites like Tom\u2019s Guide, which declared, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but touchscreens in cars are stupid.\u201dADVERTISEMENTCarmakers have noticed\u2014and they\u2019ve begun to change their tune. Given the higher costs of using physical controls, it\u2019s unsurprising that Porsche has been at the vanguard, returning buttons to the interior of the 2024 Cayenne. (Bugatti, meanwhile, never adopted touchscreens in the first place.) \u201cOne would hope that luxury trickles down,\u201d said Farah. \u201cAs they reject the screens, it could over time be seen as luxurious to have buttons instead.\u201dVolkswagen, which owns Porsche, has acknowledged that customer feedback led it to drop its much-loathed steering wheel touch controls that were nearly impossible to use without looking down from the windshield, and executives have suggested adding more buttons to its future EVs.Meanwhile, the few big automakers that skipped the touchscreen craze have not been shy about letting the world know\u2014while offering a few digs at their competitors. \u201cI think people are going to get tired of these big black screens,\u201d Alfonso Albaisa, Nissan\u2019s senior VP for global design, told Green Car Reports. Hyundai, too, has voiced its commitment to buttons and dials.With automakers backing away from a trend that has contributed to the U.S.\u2019s sky-high levels of crash deaths, you might expect the federal government to offer a tailwind, perhaps with new regulations or at least by publicly congratulating the carmakers that are adopting safer interior designs. But NHTSA has stayed mum. Asked about any new programs or approaches, the agency said in an email that \u201cDistraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens and other visual displays.\u201dRECOMMENDED FOR YOUMy Son\u2019s Friend Saw Me Breastfeeding. Now I\u2019m In Big Trouble.Why Netflix\u2019s Hit New Thriller Is Ludicrous\u2014but It Was Fun to Watch AnywayLet Us Gleefully Kill the Dumbest Wedding Tradition of Them AllWhile much of the recent infotainment news has been positive, that\u2019s not true for all of it. Some automakers seem to be doubling down on their commitment to screens; the new Mercedes 2024 E-Class will come with up to three of them. Even more troubling was General Motors\u2019 recent announcement that its future models would be incompatible with widely used Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, instead requiring owners to navigate a new infotainment interface. As a result, those accustomed to CarPlay or Android Auto will need to ascend a learning curve when they buy a new car, borrow a friend\u2019s vehicle, or get a rental. Learning curves and car safety do not mix well.ADVERTISEMENTStill, automakers like Nissan and Hyundai deserve praise for standing against a Tesla-fueled trend that has made driving more dangerous. And Volkswagen should get at least partial credit for belatedly seeing the light, even if it was a consumer backlash that forced them there.The invisible hand has done road safety few favors; carmakers\u2019 inability to profit from protecting those outside of the cars is a big reason they shrug off the danger they create for pedestrians and cyclists. But with touchscreens, at least, market forces seem to be helping to make U.S. roadways a bit less deadly.TWEETSHARECOMMENTTransportationCars",

    "hn_content": "Automakers are finally admitting that drivers find touchscreens distracting and dangerous. Physical buttons have significant advantages over touchscreens, including providing tactile feedback and not requiring drivers to take their eyes off the road. Some jurisdictions have limits on using touchscreens while driving, but safety certifications for cars with touchscreens still raise questions about the certification process. Insurance rates on touch screen cars may be higher due to their higher power, but it's unclear if auto insurance charging more corresponds to more crashes involving cars with touchscreens. Properly designed touch screen interfaces could be just as safe as physical buttons.Users discuss the user interface (UI) design of their car's physical buttons and touchscreen controls. They recognize the benefits of tactile feedback for physical controls and the drawbacks of touchscreen controls when driving, which require visual attention and are easily bumped accidentally. They discuss issues like button placement, button size, menus, unclear feedback, and jostling touchscreen targets. One user suggests using googly eyes as a cheap fix to make the button easier to find, another notes that as people age and drive more, they'll need better UI design, and a third suggests practicing with physical buttons to improve muscle memory.The discussion revolves around the benefits of physical buttons versus touch screens in cars. Some argue that physical buttons are easier to operate without having to take eyes off the road, while others argue that touch screens with haptic feedback can provide an even more intuitive solution. However, it is agreed that poorly designed interfaces can make touch screens difficult to use effectively while driving, and that physical buttons can be superior in certain situations. The article highlights the importance of designing interfaces that prioritize safety and ease of use for drivers.Engineers discuss the challenges of developing performant software for vehicles, citing feature creep, cost-cutting measures, and a lack of product vision as primary obstacles. They compare the software stack of modern car systems to simpler, more performant systems of the past, emphasizing the importance of avoiding unnecessary layers and utilizing hardware data sheets. Some commenters note the lack of consequences for delivering low-quality software, and suggest that engineers need to push back against unrealistic timelines and feature requests. One user suggests applying higher professional standards and consumer protections to the industry.Acme faces a class action lawsuit from crash victims and drivers due to unsafe software updates compromising critical driving features to meet engagement with entertainment apps. Correspondence between software engineers reveals that engineers expressing concerns were overruled by senior management, allowing the release of the compromised update. There is a discussion on whether the Product Manager B, who approved the release, should face consequences. Comments discuss the pressure on engineers to meet unreasonable deadlines and cost cuts, even if it means compromising safety. Some argue for certification and liability for software engineers to prevent such instances.Automotive-grade components tend to trade power for durability and certifications, and then the infotainment underperforms or is laggy. The responsibility for crappy products lies entirely with the product owners, who are aware that the system may lag or have other issues. Working on a project means that the usefulness of the thing produced is a non-goal because the customer is not a user. Although it is an engineer's role to make trade-offs understandable by decision-makers, part of being a professional is understanding that software is developed to meet broader business goals, which may not be the delivery of quality software. Although trust in car manufacturers to address software-related issues is low, some feedback suggests manufacturers are receiving feedback that the quality of the controls, especially touchscreen-based, is now a major factor for potential customers.A discussion on HN centers around car infotainment systems being less responsive than first-gen iPhones. One commenter notes that the mobile hardware has changed dramatically since that time and should be more responsive. However, another commenter suggests that it's not a hardware issue but rather a management issue where corporate policies don't prioritize efficient software development. Automotive software is written by different developers every time, and employees frequently change roles, which makes it difficult to improve on previous iterations. Additionally, a lack of redundancy in roles and skillsets is an issue. Car infotainment systems are still basic but rewritten every time, often by a third party with the lowest bid due to cost-cutting measures.A third-party company wins the contract for BMW's next car infotainment, causing a complete rebuild from scratch. Automotive industries outsource every button on the dash to another company, causing lack of optimization work, making software development difficult. BMW's boot expectation for a component is said to be sub-8-minutes, but some companies push back as it is unreasonable. Automotive companies change manufacturing and rebuild each car model from scratch. German auto companies demand source code and tooling to avoid lock-in and constant rebuilding. Lack of optimization work and poor technical leadership in the development of the software affects the response time, making the UI seemingly unresponsive. The solution is regulatory bodies for a set response latency and limit, including over-life degradation. The benefit of buttons is not response time, but the tactile feedback allowing users to function without taking their eyes off the road.Experts weigh in on the benefits of tactile buttons in modern cars, with some arguing that touchscreen interfaces, while flexible, are not superior in situations where drivers need to focus on the road. They cite the lack of tactile feedback and the need to look at the interface to locate buttons as drawbacks of touchscreen interfaces. Others argue that manufacturers are too focused on saving money on buttons and charging more for touchscreens. Meanwhile, some car models have made efforts to integrate physical buttons that are easy to find and distinguishable even while driving.Experts in the tech industry are discussing the problems with touchscreens replacing physical controls in cars. Users complain of difficulty adjusting settings without looking away from the road, delayed responses, and lack of tactile feedback. The article suggests that this issue has been present for over 20 years, and that developers prioritize hardware and software cost over human-oriented design in car interfaces. Some users express frustration with poorly designed entertainment systems that block the navigation view or have unintuitive controls. Ultimately, the consensus among experts seems to be that touchscreens are a poor choice for the fast-paced and safety-critical environment of driving.The drawbacks of touchscreens in cars are discussed, with some commenters arguing that physical buttons are a better option due to ease of use and safety concerns. However, others note that voice controls and better hardware could improve the touchscreen experience. The broader discussion includes touchscreens in other areas of life, such as stovetops and televisions, with many arguing in favor of physical buttons for ease of use. Overall, the discussion highlights ongoing debates around the trade-offs between touchscreen functionality and safety/simplicity of design.Many people express frustration with touch interfaces on appliances, citing concerns about spills and difficulty using them, noting that physical knobs tend to be easier to use. However, some commenters share positive experiences with touch interfaces, citing improvements in spill resistance and overall design. Others point out issues beyond the kitchen, including touch panels on elevators and ticket machines, proposed hybrid designs combining physical and touch controls, and challenges faced by older users. One comment notes that emergency room doctors and insurance companies also prefer physical controls, and the article examines the relative benefits of each type of interface.Physical buttons are preferred over touchscreens for people with vision impairments or who need tactile feedback when pressing buttons. Many readers share their opinions and experiences with touchscreens and physical buttons, such as the unpopular touch bar on the MacBook, the limitations of touchscreens in vehicles, and the importance of consistent labeling on physical buttons. Some suggest using soft keys or screens with changeable labels to combine the benefits of physical buttons and touchscreens, but others argue that having to look away from the road or memorize button sequences is an issue.-FAA approved touchscreen controls in aircraft as they are not seen as a safety issue during cruise flight \n-Touchscreens are mostly used for navigation and communication during flight \n-Fighters use HOTAS which places buttons, switches or other controls under most of the fingers \n-Multifunction displays (MFDs) in aircraft have intuitive UX as avionics manufacturers take UX seriously \n-Planes can afford to have worse UI than cars as 99% of the time there is nothing around them\n-ER doctors use touchscreens because they need to be cleaned easily \n-Some medical equipment have removable silicone membrane covers over mechanical buttons \n-Cost to user is often overlooked in favor of keeping the BOM low in designing tech devices \n-Leap motion devices were used in operating theaters as a touchless interface to MRI software but often provided glitchy data\n",

    "hn_content": "Spanish users are quitting Netflix due to aggressive password policing. Many users feel betrayed by Netflix\u2019s recent decision to block members from sharing passwords with family members. This has resulted in the loss of about one million subscribers, which could be problematic for Netflix in the long run. Some users are hoping that artists (filmmakers, musicians) will create a common fair streaming platform named \"United Artists.\" Meanwhile, other companies like Verizon are bringing back cable subscriptions, where viewers pay less than they would pay for individual streaming services.Netflix is cracking down on password sharing, limiting accounts to one \"household\". This has caused frustration amongst some who have a shared account with family or friends that live outside of their household. Previously, Netflix had been encouraging sharing of accounts across multiple devices. Some speculate that this change may not be implemented in the US, while others believe that Netflix will experiment with the change in smaller regions to assess its effect. Despite disgruntled reactions to the change, some believe that it will lead to fair pricing and more accurate metrics.The conversation revolves around the definition of a \"household.\" The original post on Netflix's new policy limits password sharing only to family and people living in the same dwelling. Some argue that the definition allows for more flexibility of who can be included, while others insist that a household pertains only to those who live in one location. The thread also discussed the high rate of show cancellations by Netflix, which may lead users to avoid starting a new series, and the use of torrents and streaming services to obtain media.Users can use software like *arrs, Jellyfin, and Stremio to find and organize torrents for media like movies and albums; they can also set metadata requirements for those downloads. Users can also use Overseerr and jellyseer equivalent to discover media and request downloads, and have them automatically moved to the correct folder on Plex when available. Some users opt for a paid subscription like IPTV/OTT for quicker access to new content. The post features some discussion on the profitability and sustainability of streaming services and the stock market.Netflix lost more than a million users due to password sharing, with two-thirds using someone else\u2019s password according to Kantar\u2019s latest survey. However, Apple, Google and Amazon have a big advantage here in doing Family Accounts, because family accounts create barriers to sharing passwords. Alternatively, if Netflix wants to cut down on password sharing, it can offer premium PPV content to anyone with the password. Media companies also need to accept that the huge margins of profit are not sustainable, and need to price their IP fairly. However, streaming platforms like Netflix and Apple TV can offer family sharing services free of charge.Some people prefer to watch shows at their own pace, and releasing whole seasons at once offers that flexibility. For those who prefer to watch with others, coordinating a shared viewing schedule is still possible. Waiting for weekly episodes can lead to disinterest or forgetting about the show entirely. Having whole seasons available can allow for in-depth discussions and theories. Availability on streaming platforms like Netflix has allowed for wider viewership and increased interest in some shows. Delaying releases can also be a tactic to stretch out advertising revenue.Netflix's move to crack down on password sharing has led to a fall in users, with subscription cancellations tripling in the first quarter compared to the previous period. One-tenth of remaining Netflix subscribers in Spain said they planned to unsubscribe in the second quarter. However, the loss of 300,000 paying users is perceived to be temporary, and Netflix remains popular in Spain, retaining 9.6 million subscribers. Respondents to surveys about streaming habits said the company was the most popular on-demand streaming platform in the country, with Amazon Prime Video coming second with 6.6 million subscribers.Netflix's strategy of making one or two ten-episode seasons of a show and then killing it might backfire as more customers are becoming frustrated with the practice. While some viewers appreciate short series, others feel cheated out of a complete story. Furthermore, Netflix's vast library is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate with content that doesn't appeal to everyone. Some observers also feel that the company is struggling to attract experienced writers to its productions, leading to beautiful-looking shows that lack compelling scripts. Some analysts suggest that Netflix should follow the cable model and focus on a few killer titles that carry the brand.Many users are canceling their Netflix accounts due to the lack of content that interests them or because they only signed up for shared accounts. European regulations require platforms to have a minimum of 30% European productions, but not all streaming services comply. Some users enjoy foreign dramas, and reality TV is a significant market. Netflix's shared account feature allows members to watch on four screens for a relatively low price. However, if those people are cut off or access is limited, they may cancel, resulting in a loss for Netflix.A discussion on HN regarding piracy and password sharing on streaming services. Some users believe streaming services should let people \"steal\" content so they can have at least some paying customers. Others argue that password sharing hurts the streaming industry and causes cancellations, while some believe it doesn't have a significant impact. Some users criticize the lack of diverse and original content on streaming services, and others see it as a sign of an agenda or propaganda. The future of the streaming industry remains uncertain, and the value proposition of some services is decreasing.",

    "hn_content": "Microsoft's $69 billion deal to acquire Activision has been blocked by the UK government due to concerns over the size and power of US tech companies. The decision has received mixed reactions, with some applauding the move and others questioning the logic behind it. Arguments have been made that large tech companies have the ability to snuff out small competitors and harm consumers, markets, and democracy. There has also been discussion about the ethical practices of various gaming companies, with some advocating for increased regulation in the industry.The post suggests that Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision could benefit gamers and provide long-term investment for the company, while critics argue that allowing more mega-conglomerates is not the solution to toxic behavior in the gaming industry. Xbox is seen as a significant revenue provider for Microsoft's consumer department, and spinning it out may not be a solution for their struggles. There are concerns about how merging would impact user accounts and migration while hoping for fewer microtransactions and more investment in franchises. Finally, Nintendo has secure space in the industry, while Microsoft needs to shift its hardware focus to software in gaming.Gamers were upset over Microsoft's focus on non-gaming features such as motion control and DRM at the expense of gaming, which was shown in the launch presentation of Xbox One. Xbox's vision of dominating the living room has been a long-term strategy that didn't sit well with the community, and the company's mismanagement resulted in the almost end of Rare as a studio. Xbox's competitive role in the industry keeps PlayStation from stagnation and poor decision-making, and Gamepass is a potential money pit that some dislike due to its similarity to cable television.Microsoft's Xbox game industry will have the freedom to make whatever games they want as the industry shifts towards streaming. With Microsoft's Gamepass subscription users can play a large variety of games with low upfront costs, increasing opportunities for indie games to find an audience. However, some players caution against evaluating game value based on playtime and fear developers may prioritize maximizing time spent over enjoyment. Microsoft's high operating margin of 40% is noteworthy, but not necessarily indicative of insufficient competition.Apple is primarily a hardware company, while Microsoft is more focused on software. The gross margins on their respective segments are vastly different, with Apple having almost twice the margin on its hardware products compared to Microsoft's gross margin on software. Tesla's reported operating margin is disputed, and the company's ability to convert that operating margin to profit margin is uncertain. In general, the technology industry tends to have higher margins than other industries, possibly due to network effects and intellectual property laws reducing competition. Governments may try to ensure as close to perfectly competitive markets as possible, but the strawman version of capitalism with zero margins does not exist in the real world. Microsoft appears to be actively trying to out-innovate their size, investing in OpenAI and making improvements to Bing.Microsoft has acquired and invested in open source software projects like Kubernetes, TypeScript, and VSCode. They have released a new product called Loop and are going after competitors like Notion and Slack. The author believes that while Microsoft may have light anti-competitiveness, they are still a cool company and more innovative than their competitors like Google, Apple, and Facebook. There is a discussion about Chinese tech regulations' advantages and drawbacks, but overall, it's agreed that CEOs of multibillion-dollar companies deserve scrutiny.There is a discussion about the relationship between companies and governments, particularly related to authoritarian regimes like China. The conversation includes concerns about market competition, government subsidies for companies, and the impact of large companies on startups. There is also debate about whether the size of tech companies is a problem for consumers, markets, and democracy. Some argue that tech companies are too big, while others argue that they invest in and compete with each other, benefiting the market and consumers.- Smaller companies that sell out for financial gain can result in destruction or lower quality of their products and services\n- Large companies prioritize growing platforms over individual products, leading to market distortions and limited competition\n- Some anti-competitive practices, such as bundling, are more destructive to competition than acquisitions\n- The issue is not just about the size of tech companies, but also their ability to restrict competition and limit innovation\n- Hardware innovation often requires large amounts of funding, making it harder for smaller teams to compete without support from larger companies\n- The UK and other countries should prioritize creating their own ICT industries to avoid being overly dependent on foreign tech companies\n- Potential solutions include more nuanced regulation to facilitate competition among smaller and larger companies, and considering splitting up some of these large tech companies.The UK's Competition and Markets Authority blocked Microsoft's $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard based on concerns over competition and innovation. The CMA found that the deal would result in a substantial reduction in competition in the UK gaming markets, limiting choice and innovation for consumers while allowing the merged company to apply higher prices for its products. The CMA also concerned that the merger could have led to supply problems for hardware and content for video games. Activision Blizzard's shares fell by 5% following the announcement. Several comments on the news argued that big tech companies are terrible for the overall economy and contribute to inequality.- Fans of Diablo II: Resurrected are frustrated with the lack of monetization options such as paying for extra stash tabs to support development efforts.\n- Blizzard's growth and bureaucracy have led to a lack of creativity and failure to produce new, innovative products.\n- The difficulty of producing game assets of high quality has increased, requiring larger production teams and more time.\n- There is a debate on whether acquiring or changing leadership within a company is the best way to address issues.\n- Agile methodology may be problematic for productivity due to its process-heavy nature.The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has blocked Microsoft\u2019s bid to acquire Activision Blizzard, citing that the proposed $70 billion merger would \"substantially reduce competition in the gaming industry.\" Despite this, some comments suggest that Activision-Blizzard will continue on its current trajectory to maximise profit from gacha games, even if it comes at the expense of their legacy \"core\" audience. In its decision, the CMA concluded that past experience had demonstrated that the consolidation of cloud gaming providers would harm innovation and competition in the industry. Microsoft already has a considerable hold on the cloud gaming market - with an estimated 60-70% market share.Microsoft's recent acquisition of Activision-Blizzard and the controversy surrounding these companies.\n\n- Employees at ABK were staging worker unrest and an open-ended strike prior to the acquisition, but strike mostly stopped after it was announced.\n- Microsoft needs to clean up Activision-Blizzard.\n- The cost of AAA games is too high, but they take thousands of hours and AAA studios haven't tried anything different.\n- Anti-trust regulations should have blocked the merger of these multi-trillion dollar companies.\n- Microsoft is a 3rd place on consoles, non-existent on pc, acquired Bethesda, and Xbox is doing badly.\n- Microsoft has no popular way of monetizing PC games sales.\n- Thanks to Proton, most games work on Linux.- Top 1000 games on Steam considered \"platinum\" and run perfectly out of the box\n- Most games require some tweaks or have issues, and some major titles are borked or have lower ratings\n- There is debate over whether it is worth investing in games that require tweaks or have lower ratings\n- Some online games on Linux may have issues with anti-cheat and cheating\n- Comparison made to Nintendo's dominance in the mid-80s and potential anti-competitive practices\n- Concern over potential consequences of Microsoft owning both platforms and publishers in the gaming industry",

    "content": "Linen.dev: The 500KB Slack alternativeKam04/26/2023, 6:58 PMLinen is an open source Google searchable open-source Slack/Discord alternative for communities. Our vision is to merge the advantages of a forum with the real-time interaction of chat. We launched the first version of Linen a few months ago. Our initial client bundle size of ~1MB gzipped was already more streamlined than most chat apps. But we knew we could do better, so after a bunch of small optimizations, we shrunk it down to ~2MB parsed and ~500KB gzipped. We wanted to share the techniques we used and the process we went through.Why Focus on Reducing Bundle Size?Linen has millions of pages, and search engines have a specific budget on how much compute resources they allocate to crawling a website. By reducing the bundle size by half, we can potentially double the number of pages that search engines can crawl with all things being equal. Beyond search engine friendliness, a smaller bundle size also means faster initial page load speed, especially on slower connections. As a bonus side effect, it makes us more disciplined when choosing packages and libraries, which helps reduce the security attack surface area.What does these numbers mean:To identify areas for improvement, we used the webpack bundle analyzer to target our app/web directory, allowing us to visually pinpoint the space-consuming components.https://static.main.linendev.com/attachments/5b12e431-c19b-426d-a9a3-0df889e1ac22/Screen_Shot_2023-04-26_at_12.02.57_PM.jpg\u25beThis returned three numbers. Stat: 7.27 MBParsed: 3.52MBGzipped: 984.32KBStat is what webpack returns the raw amount of packages and files that is in your folder this is the least important of the three since it isn't what the client ultimately sees.Parsed is what gets ran on the client side after the bundler minimizes/uglifies your package this is how much space it takes up on the client's machine. We want to reduce this number but not the highest priority.Gzipped is what gets sent over the internet and downloaded this will impact download and page load speed the most. For us we cared the most about gzipped size since it will impact bandwidth the most. For a more detailed look we've made our January bundle size public hereOur Optimization Strategies:Fixing import issues and tree shaking problems We saw that React Icon utilized ~200KB parsed and ~50KB gzipped, even though we were only using a few SVGs from the library. Most of the time if you are only selectively importing specific functions your bundler will remove dead code through tree-shaking. We found that react-icons had an issue that lead to everything being imported. This meant that we were including every single react-icon in our package whether we need it or not. The work around was to use change the ipmorts to react-icons/all-files instead of react-icons, reducing the bundle size to 10KB parsed and 2KB gzipped.Replace libraries with custom code HeadlessUI didn't support individual importing. Although the package is small we were only using one component. We decided to replace the library with own custom written component We also noticed that we were only using AWS client for s3 upload on the client side and it was taking up significantly more bundle size we need so we replaced the entire client side package with a 2 api calls to the AWS api. Finally we were using _loadash's Union method. That was a bit heavier function which handled a lot more edge cases we needed so we replaced it all with our own custom function.All in all this strategic move saved us ~600KB parsed and ~100KB gzipped. It can be a bit time consuming but it helps you become more disciplined about which packages to add Moving code to the backend Finally, we saw that highlight.js (the library for code highlighting) was taking up 30% of our bundle size (~949.06KB parsed, ~292.58KB gzipped). Since most of our users are technical communities, it was obviously required. There was no way we could write our own, and it didn't seem like there was a lighter alternative since the ability to parse programming languages is very complicated. We ended up moving the code highlight code to a backend api that would cache the results. This meant that our bundles wouldn't need to load entire highlightjs. ConclusionUltimately we were able to drop our bundle size down by 50% which meant faster load time and better user experience and SEO performance. We focused mainly on the low hanging fruits which ended up taking us a few days of engineering effort. All in all we were happy with the investment we made and took less time than we expected.This is what our bundle size looked like at the end (April of 2023)If you see something that you think we can reduce feel free to open a Github issue or pull request:in our repo\ud83d\udc4d 3POWERED BY LINENVIEWED 58823 TIMES",

    "hn_content": "Linen.dev, a new Slack alternative, has gained attention on Hacker News for its optimization strategies, including identifying and removing unnecessary dependencies and moving highlight code to a backend API. The Linen team's proactive approach to dependency tree-shaking has impressed commentators. The article includes discussions about icons, AWS SDKs, XML, and tree-shaking tools such as Webpack and Rollup. Source-code analysis tools such as source-map-explorer and Lighthouse Treemap were recommended for verifying dependency optimization.A UI package intended for browser usage is being questioned for including CommonJS and not just `\"type\": \"module\"` and removing CommonJS from the build entirely. Some users recommend using the \"sideEffects\" property in package.json to exclude certain source files to reduce bundle size. It is also suggested that front-end devs include a step in their CI pipeline to monitor bundle size and component inclusion to optimize performance. Linen, an alternative to Slack, is being reviewed for its Google-searchable function and pricing transparency. A self-checkout flow was recently introduced on the platform. A new forum-type community platform called HN+ was launched.Linen is an open-source messaging platform that allows for public communities to search and share messages like never before. The platform is supported by VC investment and has a free offering that lets users leverage Linen\u2019s domain for public communities. Linen offers threaded conversations and search capabilities, and users can choose to host on their own domain if they would like. Linen is marketed as a Slack alternative, but users note that it is more similar to an IRC/forum alternative. Linen has potential to solve issues OSS communities have struggled with due to Slack\u2019s proprietary communication protocols.Developers discuss the visual design and functionality of Zulip, an open-source messaging application designed for efficient and easily understandable corporate communication. Users recommend it over other popular options like Slack or Discord for its speed, UX, and threading model. Other notable tech mentioned includes highlight.js, a syntax highlighting library, and Linen, a chat application that aims for improved features like non-chaotic notifications and better thread management. Linen supports two-way syncing with Slack and Discord, allowing users to adopt it without leaving their current platform. The discussion highlights the importance of UI design and reliable visual hierarchy for efficient and easy-to-use software.Linen is a new open-source messaging platform marketed as a Slack alternative that prioritizes fast performance, customization options, and user privacy. However, it lacks private chat functionalities, and some users reported issues with the searching feature. Other alternative options for team messaging include Zulip and Mattermost. Users can download the platform on Github, but deployment instructions are currently unavailable. The bundle size sits at 500KB, which may seem small, but the total memory usage could be over 10MB, depending on the browser used. Some users have wondered if IRC clients could act as a Slack alternative.Multiple alternatives to Slack have been suggested in a discussion thread, including Matrix, Mattermost, and Discourse web-forum. Matrix supports threads and has public servers for hosting searchable logs. Mattermost is self-hostable. IRC servers and logging bots can also be used for searchable logs. The focus trap issue in the \"Join\" modal is mentioned in passing. YCombinator's applications for Summer 2023 are open.",

    "hn_content": "- Hacker News thread discusses the difficulty of using OAuth in 2023\n- Poor documentation is cited as a major issue with OAuth implementation\n- OAuth is a protocol framework that lacks specific implementation details, making it harder to create generic libraries or frameworks\n- OAuth allows for a variety of different scenarios and security needs, but this can make implementation even more complex\n- Token validation in OAuth can be implementation-dependent and require additional requests to the provider\n- Suggestions include providing more minimal documentation and standardizing core OAuth implementation details.The conversation is about OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) and how to properly secure the authorization code step in the OAuth flow. The .well-known/openid-configuration endpoint is standardized, and implementing introspection is important for resource servers to validate JWT signatures. However, token introspection is rare, and OIDC-discovery is a good alternative. The state parameter helps prevent malicious attackers from creating links that go directly to the system's OAuth step finalized step. OAuth's main focus is now on authentication rather than authorization. OIDC has a single URL that is not supported in every web app for the same reason as SAML. OIDC Discovery helps locate these URLs.OAuth2 standard protocols for authorization, dynamic client registration, device authorization and metadata URL for auto-configuration of OAuth2 Authorization Servers are well-implemented, although not all providers support dynamic client registration. Kerberos is useful for authenticating desktop apps, but not great for web applications. Webauthn provides better documentation for the frontend, but is more complex to explain to users. OAuth is a protocol and a skeleton of a protocol, while OpenID Connect adds on top of OAuth for authentication, but implementation-dependent for logging out. Keycloak has changed its OpenID logout behavior, causing confusion for some clients.The article discusses the complexities of OAuth and OIDC protocols. Refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens, as these tokens are short-lived and irrevocable. Checking for revocation against the identity provider is necessary to implement logout. The RFCs detailing OAuth and OIDC contain detailed information. The documentation can be frustrating due to the use of abstract nomenclature and terminology that is confusing and conflicting. The scale and scope of compromises are taken into account when using refresh tokens instead of long-lived tokens.The comment thread discusses difficulties with OAuth implementation and documentation, including issues with library compatibility, terminology confusion, opaque error messages, and authorization scope considerations. The article mentions an Internet-Draft to fix limitations of URI parameters in M2M authentication. One user shares a well-documented OAuth 2 tutorial with relevant use cases. Another user cites an instance where Microsoft's OAuth implementation was well-documented and straightforward to implement.The post discusses implementing OAuth for authentication and authorization. It suggests calling example.com/OAuth to exchange a code for access and refresh tokens, which can be used until the access token expires, at which point you must repeat the process with the refresh token. Various users mention their different experiences, including reading documentation or implementing a custom integration. One user suggests using email verification for authentication, but others point out its inherent security flaws and limitations compared to OAuth.The Tech Times features a discussion on the challenges encountered when using OAuth2. Inadequacies in the system were highlighted, revealing the protocol\u2019s inability to seamlessly handle a range of authentication requirements. A user expressed their preference for OAuth client credential flow, which is an easy mode to create service accounts, as a workaround to the challenge. OAuth has been criticized for being too flexible, making it complicated to code, while adhering to the specifications of the authorization server. Consequently, OAuth\u2019s ease of implementation has garnered criticism, pitting it against OpenId Connect\u2019s more detailed approach, which takes a subset of the OAuth specification.OAuth is a challenging protocol for delegating authentication and solving authentication issues in complex environments. Most developers have a hard time understanding OAuth, and IT generalists encounter it out of necessity. OAuth is often confused for an authentication protocol, leading to confusion in implementation. The most popular effort extending OAuth to handle authentication is OpenID Connect. The protocol is bare-minimum to securely retrieve a token, but the understanding of basic concepts does not happen in ten minutes.OAuth is a complex authentication system that puts a lot of complexity on the client to support every possible implementation. Writing your own implementation is not recommended due to the amount of edge cases with long running timers and potentially multiple browser tabs/windows. The external dependency with an OAuth wrapper provider has its own set of risks, including relying on the network and an external company with an uncertain business model. OAuth itself does not solve the phishing issues around authentication but could be mitigated with password managers or other security mechanisms like WebAuthn, mutual TLS, and Kerberos. PKCE and redirect URI allowlisting serve different purposes in OAuth and are not entirely duplicative.- Headless systems can use OAuth client credential mode to store credentials and acquire tokens from OAuth2/OIDC provider\n- Alternative option is to implement any kind of authentication in the provider and make it accept it\n- OAuth for devices is available but has limited real world use\n- There are challenges with implementing OAuth due to multiple interpretations and deviations from the spec\n- Implementing OAuth often requires reading each company's docs and testing their API\n- Some individuals transition away from third party IdPs and spin up their own authentication and authorization stack using open source ecosystems like Ory.Developers voice criticisms of the OAuth framework. Comments reveal the problems of normalizing OAuth across providers in integration projects; difficulties of keeping up with security practices; complaints around documentation problems, inconsistent patterns, and complexity; and criticism over what OAuth does which is a framework for scoped access tokens. Readers recommend alternative solutions, such as using Next Auth, Clerk, and WorkOS. Furthermore, one reader highlights GNAP, a new security technology aimed at replacing OAuth.OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol, not an authentication protocol.\n\nOAuth 2.0 is complex with different implementations from different companies.\n\nOAuth 2.0 requires TLS to be used securely.\n\nOAuth 2.0 is a framework or metastandard.\n\nIt is hard to separate authentication and authorization at a technical level.\n\nThe OAuth standard is big and complex.\n\nOAuth 1.0a was simpler and more focused on a narrow problem.\n\nOAuth 2.0 profiles that standardize the features used to integrate with OAuth 2.0 would simplify integration tasks.Btn.social, a newly launched service, aims to offer an alternative to Auth0 and similar authentication services. The service purports to be simpler, faster, and more transparent than its competitors, offering clear pricing and no ownership of user data. Although the service is not free, its rates are lower than comparable services, and the developer promises that its pricing is predictable and transparent. The service has just launched and is still adding documentation and new OAuth providers, but it may be a useful option for those seeking an alternative to the established authentication services.",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post features comments from professionals in various fields discussing the importance of cross-disciplinary work in machine learning (ML) research. While the majority of new ML researchers are freshly minted PhDs who have only ever viewed problems from an ML point of view, the value of polymaths who understand both ML and fields such as chemistry or physics were emphasized. The lack of current societal incentives for such interdisciplinary research was discussed, and personal anecdotes were presented regarding the ease of teaching chemistry or physics to computer scientists as opposed to the reverse.The post discusses whether ML PhDs can effectively apply machine learning to fields like chemistry and biotech research where they may lack in-depth domain knowledge. Some argue that understanding the fundamental tenets of a field is crucial for applying ML successfully, while others suggest that applying off-the-shelf models to specific problems is sufficient. Companies like Genentech hire ML experts for applied work but also have groups that do deep research into model design. However, it may be easier to teach enough biology or chemistry to people with a methodological background than the other way around.Academics lack software development and engineering rigor, causing difficulty in replicating research and turning academic code into a product. ML and DL are relatively new fields, making it difficult for those with specific skill sets to learn new fields. Despite this, successful ML researchers have read several decades' worth of research papers. Arrogance and revolutionary insights can sometimes lead to breakthroughs in a new field, but this behavior may be better left to the young. In biology, genomics and theoretical ecology have been transformed by mathematics, statistics, and CS.A sarcastic conversation about physicists suggests that they tend to take the path of least resistance. Another commenter notes the value of interdisciplinary skills in innovation, citing the example of web developers in the late 90s. A Google Brain employee believes that the merger with DeepMind is happening because of researchers' desire to build models in large teams. This individual feels that return on investment for data and compute optimization outweighs more efficient alternatives until diminishing returns are reached. Other comments discuss the strengths and weaknesses of TensorFlow and PyTorch.Researchers discuss the advantages of PyTorch over TensorFlow for debugging tensors in real-time and its clear API design and documentation. Some users argue that TensorFlow is still a valid option, but the ecosystem in their specific field leans more towards PyTorch. The conversation also covers the use of Google TPUs versus Nvidia GPUs and the impact of Google's transition from TensorFlow 1.0 to 2.0. While some users suggest TF2's migration was a disaster, others note that the APIs were becoming too fatter and more complex, which led to its redesign.Google's growth in AI research from a scrappy team to a mega-powerhouse can be attributed to being at the right place with the right resources and people, cachet and great papers, and hiring up-and-coming researchers. Google Brain and Google X have different focuses and incentive structures. Waymo is costly for Alphabet with no appreciable revenue despite developing autonomous vehicles from the ground up. Google's lack of understanding of ML research led to the original TF1 API while TF2 was a total failure. Some people in the ML community deny J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber credit for inventing LSTMs and GANs. Tech learned not to act like Microsoft in the 90s but swung too far towards giving away technology for free.Google's issues are about how it pursues its products not about how it is pursuing fundamental research, with ChatGPT being a good example of this. Google's problem with capitalizing on its intellectual output is that there isn't a business model in place to do so. Even for optimization type modelling, domain knowledge is necessary to design sensible constraints for framing the problem. One author who was laid off from Google in January wrote a public and detailed essay on the company. While some have criticized this as lacking personal integrity/disclosed internal details, he claims he only shares his opinions and experiences, something that is permissible to a degree.Discussion on the legality and ethical implications of sharing internal information about company culture and workings. The conversation touches on the relevance of confidentiality clauses in employer contracts, protected activities under various laws, and the duty to inform citizens and lawful residents about what to expect when applying for a job at a particular company. The discussion also centers on the responsibility of individuals to keep confidential information private and the exceptions that apply when reporting a crime or civil infraction, such as a hostile work environment.The post discusses the idea of ownership of knowledge learned while working at a company, and whether all knowledge should eventually be owned by humanity. The comments section debates the morality and legality of violating a non-disclosure agreement. Some argue that there is nothing wrong with sharing opinions about a former employer, while others believe it is a betrayal to former teammates. The relationship between employers and employees is also discussed, with some feeling that loyalty should only go so far, and others believing that there should be greater loyalty.There are mixed opinions on Google's secrecy policies and contracts. Some say it's good professional practice to wait before disclosing internals, while others criticize the conflict of interests between employer and employee. The merger between Google's Brain and DeepMind is expected to lead to project cancellations, mergers, and reallocations of headcount, which will test Sundar's leadership skills. Some believe the merger will fail because adding more people won't necessarily fix the problems. The post also includes commentary on the AI industry and the role of thought leaders.",

Manufacturers argued they were concerned it could allow equipment owners to illegally \"crank up\" horsepower and bypass emissions controls, however, proponents argued it would protect small and family businesses.Some lawmakers in Colorado are introducing a new bill that would prevent farming machine manufacturers from using proprietary software to stop farmers from repairing or modifying their own equipment. This is similar to a 2018 law passed by Massachusetts, which enables owners to fix their product locally or using third-party workshops. However, the Colorado bill is facing pressure from corporate lobbyists representing agricultural equipment manufacturers, such as John Deere, who claim protecting intellectual property is necessary to recoup costs and fund future research and development. The lobbyists claim that any measure to ensure the 'right to repair' could even compromise the safety of the equipment.\nJohn Deere's reluctance to make their equipment easy to repair, along with the fact they do not offer sale the \"you will own everything and we will be pissed\" version of their tractors, is costing customers more money in the long run.

    "hn_content": "Google Authenticator's cloud sync feature allows Google to see users' 2FA codes and the name of the services they use, potentially for personalized ads. Users may also face risks if Google were to be legally forced to divulge this information. Currently, there is no end-to-end encryption for the secrets stored in the cloud using Google Authenticator, but a password could be required for encryption/decryption. It is important to consider the threat level and threat model when using Google's services. Some services have a recovery procedure for lost 2FA secrets that does not require storing of secrets in an unprotected manner.There is a discussion regarding the potential for Google to be requested by authorities to access user data. It is suggested that the government can compel companies to turn over user data under threat of jailing the executives and fining the company. However, there is also a debate on whether Google itself has access to user data including 2FA secrets. Chrome passwords are encrytped with a Google password by default, though it is not E2EE, so an unusual or severe circumstances could lead to data leaks, but there is still\u00a0a security protocol for Google and iCloud data, for example Apple's ADP (Advanced Data Protection)utilizing E2EE.Google does not encrypt 2FA codes for users who opt-in to sync 2FA across devices, making it susceptible to hackers. Apple had it encrypted before, and agencies like FBI could previously access Apple data by storing keys alongside users' data. However, Apple has not been compelled by the courts to decrypt e2e information. Users have a choice to switch to other platforms like 2fas.com, although Delaware company support for 12 employees working on a free mobile app is questionable. Alternatively, people can use offline TOTP or similar for real 2FA. Finally, logging out in the app will stop synchronization.Users on a forum are discussing the security of Chrome passwords, which are encrypted with the user's Google account but can potentially be decrypted through a targeted attack or the syncing of passwords with Google's cloud service. Some suggest using other 2FA options such as WebAuthn or security keys, while others argue that TOTP is still an affordable and effective way to secure accounts. There is also discussion about the security of Authy's encrypted backups and the dangers of using SMS codes for 2FA.The article discusses the lack of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in Google Authenticator's backup feature. Some users criticize the use of the E2EE term, but the author argues its validity. The lack of E2EE means the secrets can be accessed by Google or anyone with access to the backup. The article suggests ways to improve this, such as implementing one-time passwords during credential transfer. The discourse also touches on the issue of public access to private cloud storage photos and data.",

    "content": "Mathematicians are drawn to prime numbers because they are hard to understand and play a fundamental role in solving problems. Plotting prime numbers in polar coordinates creates spirals and rays with a pattern that can be explained through residue classes \"mod\" a particular number. Limiting the view to prime numbers eliminates the arms corresponding to even or divisible by 3 numbers. At a larger scale, taking steps in multiples of a number close to 2\u03c0, such as 44 and its residue classes, creates gentle spirals. Primes in certain residue classes generate 20 visible arms in the prime number pattern.A post on math exchange highlights an interesting phenomenon where prime numbers are distributed in residue classes mod 744 in a spiral pattern due to 744 being a close approximation to 2\u03c0. A similar pattern occurs in residue classes mod 710 due to 113/710 also being a close approximation to 2\u03c0. Filtering for prime factors of 710 reveals an even distribution of primes among allowable residue classes, which relates to Dirichlet's theorem. The theorem states that the proportion of primes having a residue of r mod N approaches \u03d5(N)^-1 as the number of primes approaches infinity, where \u03d5 is Euler's totient function.- Dirichlet's theorem shows that there are infinitely many primes in any residue class if the residues and the modulo are coprime\n- Dirichlet's theorem relies heavily on complex analysis\n- Understanding the distribution of primes in residue classes continues to be relevant in modern research\n- Exploring arbitrary paths in mathematics can lead to important and deep facts\n- A new prompt in 3D spherical coordinates reveals another pattern with primes \n- Ulam Spiral and Chebotarev density theorem are related to pattern recognition in primes \n- Mathematicians continue to study and understand patterns of primes despite their reputation for being complicated",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post discusses the relationship between prime numbers and spirals. The post explains how all primes greater than 3 are of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1, and that this leads to spirals when plotted. The same logic is applied to primes greater than 2, which can only be of the form 4k+1 or 4k-1. The post goes on to discuss how this property of primes is useful in optimizing sieve algorithms, and how it leads to surprising, yet proven facts about primes, such as the separation of twin primes and the relationship between the squares of primes and multiples of 24.- Discussion about a formula for primes greater than 3, which states that they are of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1\n- Mention of alternate formulas or patterns for primes\n- Explanation of how the formula works and why it leads to spiral patterns in a polar coordinate system\n- Reference to a YouTube video and an animation engine demonstrating this concept\n- Brief mention of other mathematical concepts related to primes and patternsA discussion on a math video about prime numbers that form spiral patterns on a polar graph. The post includes comments about the importance of prime numbers in cryptography, the existence of patterns in primes, and the Riemann hypothesis. There is also an explanation of why the year in the title matters for articles on HN, and a reference to the Pentium FDIV bug. Overall, the post touches on various aspects of math and technology, with a focus on prime numbers and their patterns.",
