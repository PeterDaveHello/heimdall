By infiltrating the Chromium project like this, rather than trialling it in their own Chrome browser, Google are intentionally seeking to infect the vast majority of Internet users' devices without most of them even knowing, even if they intentionally boycott Google over this attack. If WEI is implemented in web browsers, all users will be held hostage by companies to only use approved devices in approved ways to access approved websites, being tracked and exploited while doing so.

Instead of keeping a single ad on a website people in marketing positions decided to add ads to every possible spot on their websites in order to earn more money. This turned into a race to bottom with ads being cheaper and cheaper and websites adding more and more of them. This is what turned news sites into barely readable ad invested shitholes. And even worse this so called expensive content has been optimized up to the point where the only reason the content has even been created is for baiting people in clicks. That's the state of ad driven content these days. And on top of that ads are a walking a privacy invasion. They want to optimize their ads more and more by collecting every click and even further in order to build better advertising profiles.Quality content is behind paywalls lately anyways.14Ultrabenosaurus, VegaDeftwing, Henning-K, fhhelling, CeeBeeEh, joaogeada, jbglaw, sudoCss, Goorzhel, quantumdecoherence, and 4 more reacted with thumbs up emoji1Ultrabenosaurus reacted with heart emojiBlindmikey commented on 6f47a22 12 hours agoJul 26, 2023 \u2022editedUsers like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want or need to do it without paying directly.Then those websites can develop their own paywalls.This \u201cWeb Environment Integrity\u201d work by Google is an afront to everyone.

(Vivaldi does not have that and it never will.)Vivaldi has announced it will support WEI becuase they have no other choice. That's the problem.Also, I see all kinds of comments from people saying this is something as simple as a fight against adblockers. These people are not getting the full picture. This is an attack on open computing. Just like Microsoft wants with Pluton or Google themselves with Play Integrity. If websites implement support for this, only browsers and operating systems that these attesters (Google, Apple, Microsoft) says they're allowed will be allowed to view them. Google will get everyone onboard claiming it'll save ad revenue at first.Soon they'll start forcing this down the throat of every user by downranking websites that don't use it. Just like AMP. You won't be able to use custom browsers, operating systems like linux, curl, web scrapers. The latter also means no new search engines. These 3 companies will hold the key to the internet.Remember web is the last open space we have. Anyone can make a browser, all they have to do is support the open standards. But this if it becomes a standard will ensure only these companies will be allowed to build one. And since attestation is reliant from a hardware tpm to the os itself, these 3 will remain the only companies who can build an os or even a computer as well. Good bye linux. Good bye RISC-V. Intel and amd won.You made your own chip? You can't access this website. You made your own linux distro? You can't access this website. You built your own browser? You can't access this website.

And google is not alone. The other two major operating system companies, namely MS and apple, are doing the same. Their focus is not the end users, but the (non-tech or other tech) corporations and institutions (such as governments, universities, and schools) which provide cloud services that end users cannot live without.Gabriel Sieben summarizes the situation very well for the non-techies:\"Old copy protection systems tried to control what your PC could do, and were always defeated. Remote attestation by itself permits your PC to do almost anything you want, but ensures your PC can\u2019t talk to any services requiring attestation if they don\u2019t like what your PC is doing or not doing.\"Thus, switching from chrome to other browsers that respect user freedom will only end up not being able to use many cloud services.Unfortunately the technical barrier to understanding this issue is too high for most end users. We need to bring awareness to the public and raise visibility of this issue by creating analogies, illustrations, black-mirror-like near-future fictions, videos, ...If you happen to be in Taipei for COSCUP this weekend, I will be talking about \"you, the problem tpm2 solves\" there and will be glad to discuss this issue with you.update: found a more relevant link for the apple implementation of \"attestation\".6adithya-s-sekhar, DarthFutuza, tagawa, sudoCss, quantumdecoherence, and spacesynth reacted with thumbs up emojidennisstewart commented on 6f47a22 7 hours agoJul 27, 2023I'm mailing a letter to the FTC and I suggest you join me: https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/report-antitrust-violationTo whom it may concern,I am a cybersecurity engineer and US citizen who is concerned about recent anticompetitive developments in the field of web browsers. Google, Apple, and Microsoft are colluding by using their overwhelming market shares to implement attestation services (Web Environment Integrity, Private Access Tokens). This will solidify their monopoly positions by locking out competitors and reducing consumer choice. I hope the FTC will consider bringing antitrust lawsuits against these businesses.Attestation relies on Trusted Platform Modules (\u201cTPMs\u201d), small computers with limited access built inside of devices. Most Americans\u2019 experience with TPMs have been in the form of fingerprint or face unlock for cell phones. Fingerprints, etc. are stored inside the TPM. When you unlock the phone, the TPM uses cryptographic signatures to check the phone has not been tampered with, then replies with \u2018success\u2019 or \u2018failure\u2019.This technology can prevent an unauthorized user, like a thief, from accessing a device. However, businesses define unauthorized users differently than their customers. John Deere uses attestation to prevent farmers and third-party mechanics from repairing their own tractors. Only John Deere-authorized mechanics can communicate with the TPM, allowing them to raise prices without fear of competition. Apple\u2019s Managed Device Attestation uses the same method of restricting replacement parts for their products, and Google\u2019s SafetyNet attestation depends on software that tracks its users. Allowing these companies to expand attestation beyond their walled gardens into the open ecosystem of the Internet will be disastrous.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Department of Justice and foreign regulatory bodies brought antitrust cases against Microsoft for its anticompetitive bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. Microsoft\u2019s victory led to years of stagnation in the web browser field. Google and Apple were only able to compete by leveraging their own monopoly ecosystems.Today, Microsoft still bundles their web browser into Windows, Google has dominance over desktop computers and Android phones, and Apple doesn\u2019t allow any browser engines but their own on iPhones and iPads. These three companies each have far more market power than Microsoft did at the turn of the millennium.I hope the FTC will bring suit against Google, Apple, and Microsoft to break up their monopolies before they can use attestation services to entrench themselves further.Thank you for your consideration.17ZeroCool940711, adithya-s-sekhar, jimzhong, TheoryOfNekomata, makeasnek, Askannz, Blindmikey, dilinger, Hanmac, jbglaw, and 7 more reacted with thumbs up emojiadithya-s-sekhar commented on 6f47a22 7 hours agoJul 27, 2023 \u2022editedI don't think the US Government wants to break up these companies.

This time, we have come across some controversy caused by a new Web Environment Integrity spec that Google seems to be working on.At this time, I could not find any official message from Google about this spec, so it is possible that it is just the work of some misguided engineer at the company that has no backing from higher up, but it seems to be work that has gone on for more than a year, and the resulting spec is so toxic to the open Web that at this point, Google needs to at least give some explanation as to how it could go so far.What is Web Environment Integrity? It is simply dangerous.The spec in question, which is described at https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md, is called Web Environment Integrity. The idea of it is as simple as it is dangerous. It would provide websites with an API telling them whether the browser and the platform it is running on that is currently in use is trusted by an authoritative third party (called an attester). The details are nebulous, but the goal seems to be to prevent \u201cfake\u201d interactions with websites of all kinds. While this seems like a noble motivation, and the use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible and has already been equated with DRM for websites, with all that it implies.It is also interesting to note that the first use case listed is about ensuring that interactions with ads are genuine. While this is not problematic on the surface, it certainly hints at the idea that Google is willing to use any means of bolstering its advertising platform, regardless of the potential harm to the users of the web.Despite the text mentioning the incredible risk of excluding vendors (read, other browsers), it only makes a lukewarm attempt at addressing the issue and ends up without any real solution.So, what is the issue?Simply, if an entity has the power of deciding which browsers are trusted and which are not, there is no guarantee that they will trust any given browser. Any new browser would by default not be trusted until they have somehow demonstrated that they are trustworthy, to the discretion of the attesters. Also, anyone stuck running on legacy software where this spec is not supported would eventually be excluded from the web.To make matters worse, the primary example given of an attester is Google Play on Android. This means Google decides which browser is trustworthy on its own platform. I do not see how they can be expected to be impartial.On Windows, they would probably defer to Microsoft via the Windows Store, and on Mac, they would defer to Apple. So, we can expect that at least Edge and Safari are going to be trusted. Any other browser will be left to the good graces of those three companies.Of course, you can note one glaring omission in the previous paragraph. What of Linux? Well, that is the big question. Will Linux be completely excluded from browsing the web? Or will Canonical become the decider by virtue of controlling the snaps package repositories? Who knows. But it\u2019s not looking good for Linux.This alone would be bad enough, but it gets worse. The spec hints heavily that one aim is to ensure that real people are interacting with the website. It does not clarify in any way how it aims to do that, so we are left with some big questions about how it will achieve this.Will behavioral data be used to see if the user behaves in a human-like fashion? Will this data be presented to the attesters? Will accessibility tools that rely on automating input to the browser cause it to become untrusted? Will it affect extensions? The spec does currently specify a carveout for browser modifications and extensions, but those can make automating interactions with a website trivial. So, either the spec is useless or restrictions will eventually be applied there too. It would otherwise be trivial for an attacker to bypass the whole thing.Can we just refuse to implement it?Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple this time. Any browser choosing not to implement this would not be trusted and any website choosing to use this API could therefore reject users from those browsers. Google also has ways to drive adoptions by websites themselves.First, they can easily make all their properties depend on using these features, and not being able to use Google websites is a death sentence for most browsers already.Furthermore, they could try to mandate that sites that use Google Ads use this API as well, which makes sense since the first goal is to prevent fake ad clicks. That would quickly ensure that any browser not supporting the API would be doomed.There is hope.There is an overwhelming likelihood that EU law will not allow a few companies to have a huge amount of power in deciding which browsers are allowed and which are not. There is no doubt that attesters would be under a huge amount of pressure to be as fair as possible.Unfortunately, legislative and judicial machineries tend to be slow and there is no saying how much damage will be done while governments and judges are examining this. If this is allowed to move forward, it will be a hard time for the open web and might affect smaller vendors significantly.It has been long known that Google\u2019s dominance of the web browser market gives them the potential to become an existential threat to the web. With every bad idea they have brought to the table, like FLOC, TOPIC, and Client Hints, they have come closer to realizing that potential.Web Environment Integrity is more of the same but also a step above the rest in the threat it represents, especially since it could be used to encourage Microsoft and Apple to cooperate with Google to restrict competition both in the browser space and the operating system space. It is imperative that they be called out on this and prevented from moving forward.While our vigilance allows us to notice and push back against all these attempts to undermine the web, the only long-term solution is to get Google to be on an even playing field. Legislation helps there, but so does reducing their market share.Similarly, our voice grows in strength for every Vivaldi user, allowing us to be more effective in these discussions. We hope that users of the web realize this and choose their browsers consequently.The fight for the web to remain open is going to be a long one and there is much at stake. Let us fight together.Share articleFACEBOOKMASTODONTWITTERREDDITWritten by Julien PicalausaSoftware developer at Vivaldi since January 2017.

Her family and friends are devastated and have requested privacy at this very difficult time.\u201dThe acclaimed Dublin performer released 10 studio albums, while her song Nothing Compares 2 U was named the number one world single in 1990 by the Billboard Music Awards. Her version of the ballad, written by musician Prince, topped the charts around the globe and earned her three Grammy nominations.The accompanying music video, directed by English filmmaker John Maybury, consisted mostly of a close-up of O\u2019Connor\u2019s face as she sung the lyrics and became as famous as her recording of the song.READ MORESin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor: A take-no-prisoners defiance in the face of traumaSin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor 1966-2023: A life in picturesWhy Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor Matters: Radical at the right time in the correct waySin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor at Vicar Street: A once-in-a-generation singer in the form of her lifeIn 1991, O\u2019Connor was named artist of the year by Rolling Stone magazine on the back of the song\u2019s success.O\u2019Connor was presented with the inaugural award for Classic Irish Album at the RT\u00c9 Choice Music Awards earlier this year.Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor receives the Classic Irish Album award for I Do Not Want What I Haven\u2019t Got at the RT\u00c9 Choice Music Prize at Vicar Street on March 9th.

It was brilliant,\u201d she later said of her protest. \u201cBut it was very traumatising,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was open season on treating me like a crazy bitch.\u201dThe year before that high-profile protest, she boycotted the Grammy Awards, the music industry\u2019s answer to the Oscars, saying she did not want \u201cto be part of a world that measures artistic ability by material success\u201d.She refused the playing of US national anthem before her concerts, drawing further public scorn.In more recent years, O\u2019Connor became better known for her spiritualism and activism, and spoke publicly about her mental health struggles.In 2007, O\u2019Connor told US talkshow Oprah Winfrey that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder four years previously and that before her diagnosis she had struggled with thoughts of suicide and overwhelming fear.She said at the time that medication had helped her find more balance, but \u201cit\u2019s a work in progress\u201d. O\u2019Connor had also voiced support for other young women performers facing intense public scrutiny, including Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus.O\u2019Connor, who married four times, was ordained a priest in the Latin Tridentine church, an independent Catholic church not in communion with Rome, in 1999.The singer converted to Islam in 2018 and changed her name to Shuhada Sadaqat, though continued to perform under the name Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor. In 2021, O\u2019Connor released a memoir Rememberings, while last year a film on her life was directed by Kathryn Ferguson.On July 12th, O\u2019Connor posted on her official Facebook page that she had moved back to London, was finishing an album and planned to release it early next year. She said she intended to tour Australia and New Zealand towards the end of 2024 followed by Europe, the United States and other locations in early 2025.The circumstances of her death remain unclear.O\u2019Connor is survived by her three children. Her son, Shane, died last year aged 17.Former Late Late Show host Ryan Tubridy said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the news of O\u2019Connor\u2019s death.\u201cWe spoke days ago and she was as kind, powerful, passionate, determined and decent as ever,\u201d he said in a post on Instagram.Addressing O\u2019Connor directly, he said: \u201cRest in peace Sin\u00e9ad, you were ahead of your time and deserve whatever peace comes your way.\u201dBroadcaster Dave Fanning said O\u2019Connor would be remembered for her music and her \u201cfearlessness\u201d and \u201cin terms of how she went out there all the time, believed in everything she was doing, wasn\u2019t always right and had absolutely no regrets at all\u201d.Canadian rock star Bryan Adams said he loved working with the Irish singer. \u201cI loved working with you making photos, doing gigs in Ireland together and chats, all my love to your family,\u201d he tweeted.REM singer Michael Stipe said: \u201cThere are no words,\u201d on his Instagram account alongside a photograph he posted of himself with O\u2019Connor.Hollywood star Russell Crowe posted a story on Twitter recounting a chance meeting with O\u2019Connor \u2013 whom he described as \u201ca hero of mine\u201d \u2013 outside a pub in Dalkey, south Dublin, while he was working in Ireland last year.\u201cWhat an amazing woman.

A lot of things that were unthinkable or unsayable in the 90s are in the open now. The arc of history is long but it bends towards justice.It\u2019s sad we\u2019re still fighting on the LGBTQ front but in general it\u2019s notable largely because justice is winning and these are the dying spasms of a hate movement that is losing state favor and is having to fight for its survival. They\u2019re fighting because if they don\u2019t then LGBTQ people are generally getting their rights protected and normalized.Scouts is another example of how much the zeitgeist has turned on overt religiousity and bigotry. Even in the 2000s you couldn\u2019t be an openly gay scoutmaster because what if you fucked a kid? And of course the deep religious pagentry/teaching that\u2019s buried in a lot of the scout materials and routines. Just 15 years later that\u2019s a really bad look.Anyway there are a few rare people who are ahead of the curve on these issues and usually take a punishment for it, but time often proves them right.She was right, and the Catholic Church and organized religion in general continue to be a plague on humanity. All the good they\u2019ve done in the past few decades is more than undone by the Mexico City policy alone and the immensely negative impact it\u2019s had on half of our population, along with continued assaults on women\u2019s health, LGBTQ rights, etc. It\u2019s just still tremendously impolite to say it but she\u2019s right, this institution is a negative force on society.As mentioned elsewhere, not standing/reciting the pledge of allegiance is another thing that was a bit controversial in the 90s but I think has just faded away nowadays. Even at sporting events today it feels a bit over the top and the connection to the hyper-militarized US culture and the pipeline to military recruiting is obvious - not a coincidence that flyovers and uniformed personnel are another common sight at sporting events.reply29athrowaway 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Archbishop Wojty\u0142a helped overthrow communist regime in the Polish People's Republic, which caused significant hardship among Polish people.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republicreplyinamorty 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Read this one as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II#Sexual_abuse...replytycho-newman 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Bold move, deploying the Epstein defense!Sure he enabled thousands of child molesters, but at least he was against communism.replyjohnohara 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I am deeply saddened by her passing.

There is no evidence to support that theory of yours, no matter how much you might wish it were true.Downplaying the evils of the Catholic Church doesn't help their victims, and doesn't help the church either.

    "content": "A few days ago, I made a social media post about Google vs. the Open Web. It received some responses, so I\u2019ll reproduce it below with some additional comments.\u201cOpen Web - Gnomedex 2008\u201d by Randy Stewart is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0Google is trying to kill the Open Web.Using the proposed \u201cWeb Environment Integrity\u201d means websites can select on which devices (browsers) they wish to be displayed, and can refuse service to other devices. It binds client side software to a website, creating a silo\u2019d app.Web Environment Integrity on GitHubThis penalizes platforms on which the preferred client side software is not available.This is an issue for accessibility and inclusion, in particular when the reason the software is not available is tied to the needs of marginalized groups, such as when poverty makes it impossible to own sufficiently modern devices, etc.\u201cWeb Environment Integrity\u201d is a deeply #antisocial proposal, and goes counter to the design principles of the web.In all honesty, this move by Google is hardly surprising. They\u2019ve been trying to capture the web as their own platform for a long time. This is just the latest battle.But it also marks a particularly perverse point, in how the proposal admits it exists primarily to extract value from people. People mining at its worst.Remember when their motto was \u201cDon\u2019t be Evil?\u201dAnalysis of the ProposalSome details on the proposal may help here.The proposal suggests that websites should be able to request an attestation from the browser about its \u201cintegrity\u201d. Such attestations are to be provided by external agents, which \u2013 presumably \u2013 examine the browser and its plugins, and issue an approval only if those checks pass.The attestation is sent back to the website, which can now decide to deny service if the agent did not give approval.Ostensibly, this is to ensure for the user that the environment has not been tampered with in any way. The described use cases, however, make fairly clear that it is for the business that this feature exists.In particular, the proposal suggests that \u201cGoogle Play\u201d could provide such attestations, and also provides an example case which intends to ensure that ads are served only to legitimate users, not to automated processes.These two points are not raised together. But put them together, and you find the following underlying problem:Advertisers want to reduce costs.Website owner wishes to display ads.Google\u2019s ad network charges per impression.Bots create impressions.The proposal effectively provides a solution for Google\u2019s advertising problem, and tries to couch it in more user friendly terms. The above scenario is the closest to a problem they describe outright.The solution, expressed in the proposal, is to exclude bots via attestations, such that ads generate impressions only with logged-in Google Play users.However\u2026In general, bots are pretty easy to exclude. They usually advertise themselves by a user agent string. Yes, that can be faked \u2013 but it seems highly unlikely that bots using faked user agents create such a large number of impressions that Google has to use this route against them. If I look at my own webserver logs, it\u2019s very clear which are bot requests just from the log information.If bots are not the actual problem, then what is?The agent providing the attestation is free to use whichever means to approve or disapprove of a browser. That includes examining whether the browser runs ad blockers.Given how advertising networks track users, and user tracking is a practice that comes under increasing criticism, ad blockers are also gaining in popularity. Security experts regularly recommend the use of ad blockers as a cyber security measure \u2013 as ads can be used to side-load malware into an otherwise legitimate website.What Google is really after is ad blockers.ProblemsThe downside of this approach is that it opens up a door for arbitrary abuse. Websites can refuse service unless you install their proprietary data collection agent. Websites can refuse service if you use the wrong browser \u2013 we\u2019d enter the browser wars of the late 90s, with renewed effort.The day this proposal gets accepted is the day the Open Web is set back by decades.In The Future of the Internet -- And How to Stop It, Jonathan Zittrain lays out, starting with the telephone network, that there exist \u201cappliances\u201d and \u201cgenerative systems\u201d.An \u201cappliance\u201d works like any other household appliance, like a toaster. It has one primary function, and all other functions it may offer are at best mild variations of the primary one. It toasts.Zittrain lists the PC and the internet as examples of generative systems. Generative systems are not necessarily as complete in functionality as an appliance \u2013 they provide some basic functionality, but with no specific primary purpose. The purpose is left to the user. Another way of phrasing this is to call these things tools, or crafting materials.Maybe it\u2019s worth pointing out the text of the above image at this point:The Open Web is a collection of user-developed, non-proprietary frameworks for building services, emphasizing interoperability and the balance of data access and ownership between providers and end-users.Generative systems are significantly more impactful than appliances precisely because they leverage the user\u2019s imagination to address their own needs. They crowdsource meaning at global scale. This is what makes the internet so powerful.Attestations from an agent doing arbitrary things effectively turns the web into an appliance \u2013 or, to be more specific, it turns the browser into an extension of an appliance website.Of course website owners are free to build appliances. They already are doing so. But this reduces the usefulness of \u201cthe web\u201d step by step, until the generative open web is lost. We\u2019re already seeing the negative effects of this, and technology like the proposed would only accelerate the trend.Google does not need to mind. The inexorable logic of capitalism means that businesses that managed to build upon a generative system to rise, now have to turn that same system into an appliance for their own needs, or risk being open to competition.ReactionsThe reactions to the post were diverse, and it\u2019s worth addressing a few.This does not imply accessibility or inclusion issues! \u2013 Yes and no. No, in principle this technology does not cause accessibility issues. But the pareto principle implies that effort should be spent on 20% of the browser market because that captures 80% of the users \u2013 and cost effectiveness then mandates that the remaining 20% of users should be ignored, because they\u2019ll cost too much to support.That is exactly the worry here. Marginalized groups which need specialized browser \u2013 for example with good screen reader capability, or capable of running on cheaper/older devices \u2013 will effectively be excluded by rational business logic.Worry about access, not about technology! \u2013 The argument is that good regulatory frameworks will legally mandate access, so that should be the focus.This is true, but not enough. The two problems with this line of thinking are that first, good regulatory frameworks are rare. And part of the reason for that is the second problem, namely that technology moves faster than the law.Which means that worrying about access instead of technology will still exclude marginalized groups in practice. What is required instead is to worry about technology in the short term, and regulation in the long term.It is legitimate for businesses to wish to protect their interests. \u2013 That is a debatable point. Businesses \u201cprotecting their interests\u201d to the detriment of people is not legitimate. But within the bounds of that, sure, why not.Here\u2019s the problem, though: the internet and open web are generative systems, which means the reason they have a positive impact is because people can decide how to use them. The moment this decision making power is curtailed, the system shifts towards an appliance.If businesses protect their interests by reducing a former generative system to an appliance, by definition this is to the detriment of people, and no longer legitimate.Updates2023-07-21: After raising a code of conduct violation for the proposal with the W3C\u2019s group responsible for said code, I was rightly told that they are not responsible (TL;DR, see the link). I then sent an email to the ombudspeople at W3C which I\u2019ll reproduce here:From jens@OBFUSCATED Fri Jul 21 17:23:38 2023Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2023 17:23:38 +0200From: \"Jens Finkhaeuser\" <jens@OBFUSCATED>To: ombuds@w3.orgSubject: Web Environment Integrity proposalDear Ombudspeople of the W3C,I wish to raise concerns about the behaviour of the people working onthe Web Environment Integrity proposal, as well as the proposalitself.https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/In particular, I would like to draw your attention to isuse #131 intheir working repository:https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/131The group working on this claims to adhere to the W3C Code of Ethicsand Professional Conduct. However, as documented in this issue, theyviolate said code.As a bit of background, WEI is a deeply unethical proposal thatsuggests to use cryptographic means to permit websites to denyservices to users based on arbitrary user metadata. Such metadatais to be processed by agents running on the user's machine, whichprovide attestations about the browser environment.One such proposed service is Google Play, which has access to personalidentifiable information (PII). This turns the proposal into atechnological mechanism for discrimination.The community has raised and is raising issues about the ethics ofsuch a proposal, which led me to find the W3C code of ethics.Unfortunately, as was pointed out to me, the code of ethics does notconcern the content of proposals - merely the conduct of participants.Unfortunately, some maintainers of the repository have taken toclosing issues raised by the community -- the fourth bullet point inthe \"participant\" explanation of the code (\"Anyone from the Publicpartaking in the W3C work environment (e.g. commenting on our specs,(...)\"). This violates several points in section 3.1 of the samedocument, whereby use of reasonable means to process diverse views arerequired.It seems to be the case that this proposal has not yet made it to aW3C group. However, its maintainers already violate the W3C code ofethics in practice in the run-up to such an activity. In the meantime,even though the code is not directly applicable to the proposalcontents, it nonetheless violates said code in spirit.It seems appropriate that W3C does not permit this proposal to go aheadin any formal fashion.Kind regards, Jens Finkhaeuser2023-07-22: Google has now closed the ability to contribute to the repository, including by raising or commenting on issues.2023-07-26 #1: Apple has already shipped a similar API for about a year. As described on the Apple developer blog, Private Access Tokens implement pretty much the same mechanism as Google\u2019s WEI.There are a few notable differences in tone, however. The first is a direct quote from the above blog post:Note: When you send token challenges, don\u2019t block the main page load. Make sure that any clients that don\u2019t support tokens still can access your website!This note is not doing anything in itself, but it does stand in stark contrast to the motivations documented in WEI. In particular, the proposal suggests that private access tokens should be used instead of e.g. CAPTCHAs or other, more disruptive authentication mechanisms.The second important difference is in the actual details of the proposal. It states that the token issuer is an external web service rather than some opaque process running on the user\u2019s machine. Suggested are some CDN providers\u2019 services. The clear message of intent here is that this is supposed to be a mechanism by which CDNs authenticate a request to the source.The protocol by which this is to be done is defined by the IETF PrivacyPass Working Group. Reading through the protocol draft, it furthermore becomes clear that the data the client is supposed to send to the issuer is\u2026 nothing but the challenge sent by the server, in an obfuscated (hashed) manner.This leads to two conclusions.No personal data is being leaked.There is no checking of the \u201cenvironment\u201d, aka the browser and its plugins, that can prevent some browsers from receiving an attestation.Not so fast!As has been pointed out to me, this analysis is incomplete. That is because the specifications provided by the PrivacyPass WG are incomplete.What is missing from the specification set is how client and attester interact. The issuer, as described above, is oblivious to PII. However, it can influence which attester to use.The attester, on the other hand, is an unknown. Various parts of the specs refer to possible ways this may occur, leaving any specifics unwritten. While this includes the possibility of clients not sending sensitive attributes to the attester, no mention of the consequences of that is made (though one can assume that attestation then fails).This openness effectively means that the same model as WEI with the same problems can be implemented \u2013 a fact the architecture document acknowledges in section 5.1 \u201cDiscriminatory Treatment\u201d.I have to thank @Mayabotics@tech.lgbt for nudging me to give those parts a closer look! I was too focused on the issuer protocol.2023-07-26 #2: Mozilla has taken a stance against WEI writing:Mozilla opposes this proposal because it contradicts our principles and vision for the Web.That\u2019s something, at least.2023-07-26 #3: As a honourable mention, the maintainer of the Google repository has published a personal blog post about their experience, which contains some fair and some unfair bits.However, one of the points bears commenting on:Don\u2019t assume a hidden agendaWhen thinking about a new proposal, it\u2019s often safe to assume that Occam\u2019s razor is applicable and the reason it is being proposed is that the team proposing it is trying to tackle the use cases the proposal handles. While the full set of organizational motivations behind supporting certain use cases may not always public (e.g. a new device type not yet announced, legal obligations, etc), the use cases themselves should give a clear enough picture of what is being solved.There are a few comments to this:Given that Apple\u2019s mechanism is undergoing IETF standardization, the only reason for an opposing mechanism is that the existing approach does not fulfil Google\u2019s needs.Google clearly states its needs in its use cases. There is no hidden agenda that people complain about, but rather the agenda as it is stated clearly in plain text.This comment actually confirms the community\u2019s worst fears.2023-07-26 #4: Some HackerNews folk have called me \u201cembarrassingly uninformed\u201d about how to detect bots.I should ignore that, but this admittedly stings a little, given that I worked on threat management solutions in a former life. With that in mind, at least my data set is a lot larger than the comments suggest.But the gist of the criticism is true to the extent that I\u2019ve written bots myself that have circumvented stronger security measures than a user agent check. Given sufficient motivation, it\u2019s in easy reach.Which begs the question: how would one write a bot that circumvents this kind of attestation mechanism?Whether it\u2019s WEI or PrivacyPass, the weak spot is the attester. Either an attack manages to convince the attester that a client is legitimate. Or a legitimate client is used, but in a way the attester will not complain about.The latter could be as simple as using Selenium WebDriver to make requests with a legitimate browser. I suspect it\u2019ll be a little more difficult than that in practice.But that is beside the point \u2013 the real point is that bots can be as sophisticated as a real browser, including being able to pass attestation.Which means WEI is, again, not really about bots at all, which was the original point these fine folk seemingly missed.2023-07-26 #5: Today is a day for lots of updates, as information on WEI continues to accumulate.Chromium already has commits for WEI, which probably means this stuff will be out a lot sooner than the specs solidify.The Interpeer Project\u2019s mission is to build next-generation internet technology that re-focuses on people over businesses.

The tech community, [\u2026]Alex IvanovsJuly 26, 2023 Updated3 min Read | Reader DisclosureIn recent news, Google has put forth a proposal known as the \"Web Environment Integrity Explainer\", authored by four of its engineers.On the surface, it appears to be a comprehensive effort to enhance trust and security in the digital landscape. However, as with many sweeping technological proposals, it's not without controversy.The tech community, especially on GitHub, has raised several eyebrows and voiced significant criticism.Mozilla has just come out to say that they oppose this proposal, \"Detecting fraud and invalid traffic is a challenging problem that we're interested in helping address. However this proposal does not explain how it will make practical progress on the listed use cases, and there are clear downsides to adopting it.\"Updated: 26.07.2023It looks like Google is already pushing this into Chromium; you can see the commit on GitHub here. And you can also read this article from Interpeer, which explains the motives behind this proposal.One of the Google employees who authored the paper (Rupert Ben Wiser) has made a comment on GitHub saying that they are feeling the backlash: read it here.The Core Proposal: A Trust-Privacy Trade-off?Google's proposal pivots on a key premise: enhancing trust in the client environment. It introduces a new API that allows websites to request a token, providing evidence about the client code's environment. Google's engineers elaborate, \"Websites funded by ads require proof that their users are human and not bots...Social websites need to differentiate between real user engagement and fake engagement...Users playing online games want assurance that other players are adhering to the game's rules.\"However, the critics argue that the quest for trust may come at the expense of privacy. While Google ensures that the tokens will not include unique identifiers, critics fear that this system, if misused, could lead to unwarranted surveillance and control.Veiled DRM and the Threat to Open WebThe proposed API, while framed as a tool for fostering trust, could potentially be used to control user behavior on the web. Some critics fear it could be a covert introduction of Digital Rights Management (DRM) into web pages, making ad-blocking near impossible.This not only impacts user experience but also raises concerns about net neutrality and the open nature of the web. As one critic aptly questioned, \"Could this be a veiled attempt at introducing DRMs for web pages, making ad-blocking near-impossible in the browser?\"Monopolization Fears: Who Controls the Attesters?A significant concern stemming from the tech community is the potential for monopolistic control. By controlling the \"attesters\" that verify client environments, Google, or any other big tech company, could potentially manipulate the trust scores, thereby deciding which websites are deemed trustworthy. This opens up a can of worms regarding the democratic nature of the web.As one GitHub user commented, \"This raises a red flag for the open nature of the web, potentially paving the way for a digital hierarchy dominated by a few tech giants.\"What About Browser Modifications and Extensions?Google's proposal remains ambiguous about its impact on browser modifications and extensions. It attests to the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack without restricting the application\u2019s functionality.However, how this plays out with browsers that allow extensions or are modified remains a grey area. As the proposal vaguely mentions, \"Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, it does not restrict the indicated application\u2019s functionality.\"Unanswered Questions and The Path ForwardThe proposal leaves several questions unanswered and open for discussion. For instance, it doesn't clearly address how it will prevent the signal from being used to exclude vendors. Google's engineers write, \"Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser who wishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements.\"However, it's unclear how these baseline requirements will be set and who will enforce them.In conclusion, while Google's proposal is a technically sophisticated attempt to enhance trust on the web, its potential implications for user privacy and the open nature of the web cannot be ignored. The tech community's concerns highlight the need for a balanced approach that doesn't compromise on either trust or privacy.It's crucial that the tech community continues to engage in these debates to ensure that the future of the web is shaped by openness, privacy, and freedom rather than control and surveillance.WRITTEN BYAlex IvanovsAlex is a full-stack developer with more than 15 years of experience.

With this release, we've transitioned our license from AGPL to MIT, aiming to expand the user base of our linker. This was not an easy decision, as those who have been following our progress know that we've been attempting to monetize our product through an AGPL/commercial license dual-licensing scheme. Unfortunately, this approach didn't meet our expectations. The license change represents our acceptance of this reality. We don't want to persist with a strategy that didn't work well.As always, we welcome new GitHub sponsors. If you are happy with the license change, please consider becoming a sponsor.In addition to the license change, here is a list of updates we have made in this release:Previously, mold could not produce an object file with more than 65520 sections using the --relocatable option. Now the bug has been fixed. (2e8bd0b)mold now interprets -undefined as a synonym for --undefined instead of -u ndefined. This seems inconsistent, as -ufoo is generally treated as -u foo (which is an alias for --undefined foo), but this is the behavior of the GNU linkers and LLVM lld, so we prioritize compatibility over consistency.-nopie is now handled as a synonym for --no-pie.[RISC-V] R_RISCV_SET_ULEB128 and R_RISCV_SUB_ULEB128 relocation types are now supported (4bffe26, 1ac5fe7)[PPC64] R_PPC64_REL32 relocation type is now supported.

This is an executable is it not? Invoking it as a separate process does not require you make the software calling it GPL so switching to MIT should have no affect in the common case.If the authors really wanted a more permissive license, then instead of relicensing from AGPL to MIT they should have relicensed from AGPL to AGPL with linking exception. An example of a project that is GPL with linking exception is libgit2 [1]. This licensing is more permissive but still permits the author to sell commercial licenses to those making closed-source code changes.[1] https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2#licensereplyhobofan 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> This licensing is more permissive but still permits the author to sell commercial licenses to those making closed-source code changes.I think the point is that the authors don't want want to continue selling licenses, as it wasn't worth the hassle.

I hope they are able to earn money from the project, but the likelihood of being able to integrate it into any work projects is much higher with MIT licensing. If we do use it, I'll try to get our company to sponsor the project.replykevin_thibedeau 19 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The license on a linker shouldn't matter. It isn't injecting copyrighted code and there's already precedent for excepting trivial boilerplate in the GPL ecosystem so nothing in the generated binary should be affected by a copyleft license on the tooling. AGPL would only restrict deploying a privately modified linker via a network service which isn't a realistic scenario for a basic dev tool.replytantalic 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]While that is true, it requires a very specific understanding of both intellectual property law and the inner workings of development tooling that is pretty rare in practice. As such, companies are generally conservative in such decisions. Most organizations have a single list of licenses allowed for use rather than getting into specific use cases for specific licenses. These types of environments will generally limit uptake of copyleft tools.All that said, I'm not convinced the licensing is the issue here (although I wish them the best). We are in a world that has grown accustom to free development tools and building a commercially viable business in tooling is incredibly difficult. I'm always amazed by how many developers I know who make a living by creating software yet are unwilling to pay for software themselves.replytyg13 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]All of those companies have no issues using `ld` right?

In some of those cases you might still get away with AGPL, but it will require putting in some effort to comply with license since in those cases the linker itself is redistributed. It's no secret that Apple is avoiding GPL as much as they can, with many of commandline tools they provide either being BSD versions or very old GPL2 versions.> AGPL would only restrict deploying a privately modified linker via a network service which isn't a realistic scenario for a basic dev tool.Interacting with linker over network service may sound weird, but it's not that uncommon. For example Unity offers Cloud build service for their engine which means indirectly interacting with Android and iOS toolchains. All major cloud providers are making solutions where the development tools and libraries are tightly integrated with their cloud service in attempts to make it harder migrating your project away from them. Regular CI/CD service providers are including the most popular development tools in their default environment, both to simplify the development process and also so that they can better cache them thus saving network costs and speeding up builds compared to each customer downloading the toolchain manually. There was also a period where multiple companies where pushing a remote dev environment as a solution to minimize the hassle of having each developer setup things locally thus improving onboarding speed, ensuring everyone is working in the same environment and also simplifying work for company wide IT management.In many of those cases there might be 2 or even 3 companies repackaging and redistributing between the original software (linker) author and final user (programmer).Even in the land of open source things aren't that simple. Not sure if it's still a thing but there was a period when FreeBSD was trying to remove GPL from it's base packages.replykevin_thibedeau 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Third party CI builds aren't distributed to anyone. Even if the compiled binary was subject to GPL rules, the binary will almost never exit the CI server where it was built so copyleft protection won't be invoked.You can use modified GPL code to your heart's content in a corporate setting. As all your coworkers are part of one legal entity, private use within the organization is not distribution per the terms of GPL. You have to distribute a binary to someone who can make a claim under the terms of the license before copyleft is activated. Furthermore, you only ever have to disclose source to someone with possession of a derived binary.replyKarliss 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I was talking about the case where linker is the software and user is the developer performing linking. And MOLD was previously AGPL licensed, meaning that having access to binary isn't required, it's sufficient to interact with the software over network for copyleft to activate.Let's imagine Google wanted to include Mold in Android sdk, and CI service company (like Travis or Github with their Actions) want to include Android SDK in their VM images. I would consider using of such CI service for building android app interacting with the linker software over network. Meaning everyone in the middle (Google and CI service) has to deal with license requirements.replydikei 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The main purpose of using AGPL as the original license is to force companies that have a blanket-ban on AGPL to buy a commercial license or just buy the entire project, as told by the author.https://gist.github.com/lleyton/9c0b75d065f37333ea9851b6cad1...It did not workout, so they're switching to MIT.replyTimon3 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Good luck convincing corporate lawyers that the license terms don't matter since we're just using it for linking.

It has the same syntax as .gitignore, but isn't tracked by Git. So you could add .cargo/config.toml to .git/info/exclude, changing the linker locally without Git considering it as an untracked file.

Disk I/O was a problem back when we used spinning rust but less so now.What takes time is rewriting stuff as you go. Running the relocation tables to insert addresses into the code is cheap. Deadstripping sections is fairly cheap, deadstripping individual basic blocks within functions takes a lot more analysis and thus time.Deduplicating constant strings is a good idea but involves streaming them all into a hashtable of some sort. Maybe you want them to share common suffixes, more work.Deduplicating, deadstripping, rewriting debug information takes time. Debug builds can feature many gigabytes of dwarf to rewrite.Oddly enough that the linker is scriptable, as in you can give it a program that it interprets, doesn't seem to be a significant cost. Probably because the script in question is quite short and somewhat limited in functionality.Historically lld was very fast because it didn't bother doing any of the debug munging or other deduplication. Lld ran fast but the output binary was big.I'm several years out of the linker performance game now so don't know the current status. In particular I don't know where mold or lld are in terms of quality of output vs their own performance.replyripley12 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This isn't the whole story, but linking is CPU-intensive and older linkers are mostly single-threaded.

SAN FRANCISCO, July 26, 2023 \u2014 The Overture Maps Foundation (OMF), a collaborative effort to enable current and next-generation interoperable open map products, today announced the release of its first open map dataset. The milestone Overture 2023-07-26-alpha.0 release includes four unique data layers: Places of Interest (POIs), Buildings, Transportation Network, and Administrative Boundaries. These layers, which combine various sources of open map data, have been validated and conflated through a series of quality checks, and are released in the Overture Maps data schema which was released publicly in June 2023. The Places dataset includes data on over 59 million places worldwide and will be a foundational element of navigation, local search, and many other location-based applications. The datasets are available for download at https://overturemaps.org/download/.Overture places data includes almost 60 million places worldwideFounded in December 2022 by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Meta, Microsoft, and TomTom, Overture today includes more than a dozen mapping, geospatial, and technology companies, including new members ESRI, Cyient, InfraMappa, Nomoko, Precisely, PTV Group, SafeGraph, Sanborn, and Sparkgeo. The collaboration is based on the premise that map data needs to be a shared asset to support future applications. As the requirements for accuracy, recency, and attribution in maps have grown to meet user needs, the costs and complexities of collecting and maintaining global map data have grown beyond the capability of any single organization. \u201cThe Overture 2023-07-26-alpha.0 release is a significant step in establishing a comprehensive, market-grade open map dataset for our constantly changing world. The Places dataset, in particular, represents a major, previously unavailable open dataset, with the potential to map everything from new businesses big and small to pop-up street markets located anywhere in the world,\u201d said Marc Prioleau, executive director of Overture Maps Foundation. \u201cAnyone who works in mapping knows that the initial data is just the beginning; the ongoing challenge lies in maintaining the data amidst constant changes to meet user expectations. Overture plans to build a broad collaboration that can build and maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive database of POIs.\u201d In the new dataset, there are four unique data layers.Places of Interest: OMF\u2019s Places data layer includes over 59 million POI records that have not previously been released as open data. This dataset, derived from data contributed to OMF by founding members Meta and Microsoft, provides a significant baseline of worldwide places data. The Overture community will combine the best data from all available resources, including open government data, crowdsourced local mapping data, AI/ML techniques and more to improve, update and extend the data on an ongoing basis. The Places dataset is licensed under CDLA Permissive v2.0, a permissive open data license, and can be freely used by any map builders or location service providers.Buildings: The OMF\u2019s Buildings layer includes over 780M unique buildings footprints worldwide. This layer has been developed by combining various open data projects including OpenStreetMap, Microsoft AI-Generated building footprints, and Esri. Transportation: The OMF\u2019s Transportation layer represents a worldwide road network derived from data in the OpenStreetMap project. This community-built data has been recast into the Overture data format which provides consistent segmentation of the data and a linear reference system to support additions of data such as speed limits or real-time traffic. Administrative Boundaries: A global open dataset of national and regional administrative boundaries, this boundary data includes regional names which have been translated into over 40 different languages to support international use.All data layers have been formatted in the OMF\u2019s recently launched data schema, which is designed to allow map services developers to ingest and use map data in a standard, documented way and will be interoperable. OMF is releasing the data publicly to solicit feedback from the public. Feedback can be submitted on GitHub or by email at data@overturemaps.org. Future releases will integrate new sources of open data, further transformation of these data layers into the OMF schema, and implementation of the Global Entity Reference System, a system of stable IDs that allows data to be consistently added to features on the map.

It provides a single file (PMTile format) that contains all the map data and you can request ranges from the single file to get the required vector data you need for a given area/zoom.So you can setup something like the following:  S3 (host the myfile.pmtiles) <- Lambda (takes the x/y/z from the path and requests the correct range) <- Cloudfront cache tile response Then you can setup tiles.mydomain.com (or use the cloudfront domain directly) and then use Leaflet or similar on the frontend to fetch/render the tiles. For Leaflet you use the protomaps plugin/lib and give it a url like \"https://tiles.yourdomain.com/20230408/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt\" where \"20230408\" maps to \"20230408.pmtiles\" in your S3 bucket. Now I can drop new pmtiles files into that bucket and update my clients to use the new source. And since the tiles are in vector format you can theme them however you want in the client which is neat. Lastly you don't have to use the 100+GB whole-earth tileset. You can use a tool [1] (provided by the same guy) to download a dataset for just a given geographical region.The .pmtiles file is a little over 100GB but the whole setup took me only an hour or two max to get running and will cost way less than Google Maps to run.[0] https://protomaps.com/[1] https://app.protomaps.com/downloads/small_mapreplymdaniel 16 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]their demo isn't doing them any favors since it seems to stop at some random zoomlevel, eliding the kind of detail that I'd care about if I were evaluating that solutiondigging into their GH repos surfaces https://protomaps.github.io/PMTiles/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr2-pu... which is at least more detailed if not quite a GMaps killerreplybdon 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I just updated https://protomaps.com it to use the more detailed file you found, thanks. So instead of a zoom level of 12 it should work down to 20+ - the actual dataset contains up to zoom 15, which is ~1 billion tiles in a single 110GB file.It's important to me that I showcase the system working as advertised - you are free to download the 110GB file from that static storage with no restrictions. Unfortunately, the demo is slow because I'm hosting it on Cloudflare R2 which has no outgoing bandwidth fees. Before, it was on DigitalOcean Spaces, which is low latency but would cost me $1-2 out of my own pocket each time someone clicked the link.The Lambda/Workers integration as described in the other comment is the preferred solution to this for developers operating this at planet scale.

I still haven't quite figured out the tuning for which features should be shown, combined, or excluded yet, and the generated layer names are sort of, but not quite compatible with similar base layers + styles from mapbox (which uses the same base data, but a different, proprietary conversion). This part takes a reasonable skill as a GIS person and some taste in the design of the feature symbology.The downside of doing this on S3 directly is that you might wind up publishing a link to a 100 gig file that would cost $10 if someone just downloaded it.

The end goal is to have a flexible basemap solution adaptable to most apps but you are free to roll your own proprietary style on top of the open source tiles if you'd like (there are already companies doing this)replywiredfool 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, that's what I was using for my basemaps, it's quite fast for Ireland on a relatively fast machine (minutes), but Europe as a whole was hours. (hetzner quad core 8 thread ~3yr old intel machine with 64G ram)I've got a couple of goals, or at least evaluations for goals --1) Have a stripped down basemap like Carto Light, but with different emphasis for the \"bicycling friendly\" roads, and selectively higher contrast/emphasis for those minor through roads that discourage car traffic but are perfect for a bike. (e.g. Irish boreens, those 1 lane or double track \"paved\" L roads that are everywhere outside of the major cities.) I find that I simply can't see the minor roads on apple/google maps when I'm out unless I'm zoomed in to the point that I can barely see a network. (fading eyesight and super low contrast).2) Another lighter base map, but with transit focused features to compliment some of the open data in Ireland around transit -- the routes and timetables and so on. I'm aiming for a site that can be 100% statically hosted but will show the routes in a more friendly manner than Bus Eireann's site.3) If it goes well, I might be doing this in a more commercial context for some clients who are currently using mapbox for their basemaps but due to political concerns need to insert in different names/boundaries for disputed areas/features. We'd love to be able to self host, but quality is a major concern there.The bugs that I'm seeing in the 1 and 2 cases are things like handling the look of freeway interchanges/flyovers at close zooms, consistently getting rivers to show at appropriate zooms because they're into two separate feature types depending on the width, with the narrow bits getting dropped. And the general mismatch between the styling I'm used to from the mapbox converted layer names/feature types and what's coming out of pmtiles/basemaps. The feature bits look like tippecanoe coalesce/drop densest features tuning, but I'm also looking at just dropping out entire feature sets to drop the size of the tiles. That should help the coalesce/dropping behavior as well.replybdon 36 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Thanks - for the issues related to freeway interchanges and rivers, it would be most helpful to report these on GitHub using screenshots and links to lat/lon positions, or even links to OSM nodes and ways.OSM is a freeform dataset and not a cartographic product, so most of the basemap work now and in the future is on getting good results of this transformation for 200+ countries. The mismatch vs. existing maps must exist because we need to ensure to downstream commercial users that all end products of the map generation are openly licensed - that's why this is being pursued as an independent, self-funded project with support from GitHub Sponsors: http://github.com/sponsors/protomapsreplywiredfool 13 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Ok, I\u2019ll dig a bit more to get some good test cases with the local data that I\u2019m familiar with, and make sure that it\u2019s not something that I\u2019m doing wrong.replybdon 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Library author here - yes, one execution happens per tile, if you have CloudFront in front those will only happen when the PoP has a miss.With 512MB RAM these generally complete in under 100ms so the unit costs of Lambda are within a few multiples of Cloudflare Workers (.5USD / million invocations)replyjoshstrange 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Like the other comment says I don't think it's quite that bad but also CloudFront (or whatever CDN you use) is going to cache the response.

The project is just short of collecting 3 million points of interest from almost 1700 spiders.Overture Maps appears to be quite a closed and proprietary project, with claims of openness limited to being able to download a data set and accompanying schema specification. Some issues that immediately come to mind:1. There is no published description for how the data was generated. End users thus are given no assurance of how accurate and complete the data is.a. As an example, administrative boundaries are frightfully complex and include disputed boundaries, significant ambiguity in definition of boundaries, and trade-off between precision of boundaries versus performance of algorithms using administrative boundary data. Which definition of a boundary does Overture Maps adhere to, or can it support multiple definitions?b. It's probable that Microsoft have contributed ld+json/microdata geographic data from BingBot crawls of the Internet. This data is notoriously incorrect, including fields mixed up and invalidly repurposed, \"CLOSED\" in field names to denote closure of a place 5 years ago but the web page remains online, and much ambiguity in opening hours specifications. For AllThePlaces, many of the spiders developed require human consideration, sometimes of considerable complexity, to piece together horribly messy data that is published by shop and restaurant franchises, and other organisations providing location data via their websites.c. For location information where +/- 1-5m accuracy and precision may be required (e.g. individual shops within a shopping centre[3]), source data is typically provided by the authoritative sources with 1mm precision and +/- 10-100m accuracy. AllThePlaces, Overture Maps, Google Maps and similar still need human editors (OpenStreetMap editors) to do on-the-ground surveys to pinpoint precise locations and to standardise the definition of a location (e.g. for a point, should it be the centroid of the largest regular polygon which could be placed in the overall irregular polygon, the center of mass of a planar lamina, the location of the main entrance, or some other definition?).d. If Overture Maps is dependent on BingBot for place data, they'll miss an enormous number of points of interest that BingBot would never be able to find. For example, an undocumented REST/JSON/GraphQL API call or modification to parameters to an observed store locator API call may be necessary to return all locations and relevant fields of data. Website developers routinely do stupid things with robots.txt such as instruct a bot to crawl 10k pages (1GB+) from a sitemap last updated 5 years ago rather than make 10 fast API calls for up-to-date data (5MB). Overture Maps would be free to consume data from AllThePlaces as it is CC-0 licensed, and possibly correlate it with other data sources such as BingBot crawl data, a government database of licensed commercial premises or postal address geocoding data. However the messiness of data in various sources would be approaching impossible to reconcile, even for humans, and Overture Maps would possibly have to decide whether to err on the side of having duplicates, or lack completeness.2. There is no published tooling for how someone else can reproduce the same data.a. AllThePlaces users fairly frequently experience the wrath of Cloudflare, Imperva and other Internet-breaking third parties, as well as custom geographic blocking schemes and more rarely, overzealous rate limiting mechanisms. If Overture Maps is dependent on BingBot crawls, they'll have a slight advantage over AllThePlaces due to deliberate whitelisting of BingBot from the likes of Cloudflare, Imperva, customer firewalls, etc. However, no matter whether you're AllThePlaces or Overture Maps or anyone else, if you want to capture as many points of interest as possible across the world, use of residential ISP subnets and anti-bot-detection software is increasingly required. They'll need people in dozens of countries each crawling websites targeted to the same country, using residential ISP address space. Otherwise they end up with an American view of the world, or a European view of the world, or something else that isn't the full picture.b. If Overture Maps has locations incorrect for a franchise/brand due to a data cleansing problem or sourcing data from a bad source (perhaps non-authoritative), there are no software repositories for the franchise/brand to raise an issue or submit a patch against.[1] https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/[2] http://nsi.guide/[3] Example Australian shopping centre as captured by AllThePlaces: https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/map/#18.07/-33.834646/150.98952...replytony_cannistra 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> 2. There is no published tooling for how someone else can reproduce the same data.This is true, and is actually the whole point of Overture.Overture was developed to enable private companies to leverage open data (like OpenStreetMap) but also combine it with their proprietary data and processes.The intention is to share the result with a relatively permissive license (a new thing called the Community Database License Agreement) but keep the process and underlying data proprietary.replyuneekname 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, exactly. Overture is, for better or worse, looking to create a dataset that is more difficult to mess with / contribute to.I'm big on OpenStreetMap, but I can't deny its a bit of a liability for Facebook and other companies that display maps to their users. There is the occasional vandalism edit that simply can't be shown to an end-user. Facebook put significant effort into maintaining a moderated version of the OSM database that lags behind the real-time edits. Facebook, Microsoft, TomTom, etc. know this is a ton of work and want to pool their resources. Making it open also helps to openly compete with Google, the other big map data provider.If you want to contribute to Overture as an end-user, AFAICT your best option is to edit OpenStreetMap and see if your changes eventually get pulled in. Overture has promised the OSM community that they'll make much of their data available to be contributed back, we'll see if that pans out.When it comes to AllThePlaces -- as an OSM nerd it seems like there is an opportunity to build a better bridge between this and OpenStreetMap, to make it easier to quickly update businesses in an area. Recently there has been a pretty successful push to link OSM data with WikiData, using tools like the OSM \u2194 Wikidata matcher [0]. For POIs, it's a lot of work to add a bunch of local businesses, even with tools like EveryDoor [1].

I suspect the commercial vendors they work with probably image the entire CONUS area every 12 months or so.The imagery that would seem to be more in-demand would be the aerial photos used at very high zoom levels. I'm not a geospatial expert but I think these images are combined with some sort of LIDAR or multi-spectrum imagery to have height maps in tandem with the visuals. That strikes me as pretty expensive to obtain.replyanukul 7 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Has anyone been able to visually assess this dataset's accuracy against OSM / Google Maps etc for any given region?Looks like it will be a while before that can be done, seeing as it uses a custom schema.replysdfghswe 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]What's the difference between this and Open Street Maps?replymatkoniecz 16 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]OpenStreetMap is community of people creating fully open map database.

Available in open source on GitHub in addition to Stability\u2019s API and consumer apps, ClipDrop and DreamStudio, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 delivers \u201cmore vibrant\u201d and \u201caccurate\u201d colors and better contrast, shadows and lighting compared to its predecessor, Stability claims.In an interview with TechCrunch, Joe Penna, Stability AI\u2019s head of applied machine learning, noted that Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, which contains 3.5 billion parameters, can yield full 1-megapixel resolution images \u201cin seconds\u201d in multiple aspect ratios. \u201cParameters\u201d are the parts of a model learned from training data and essentially define the skill of the model on a problem, in this case generating images.The previous-gen Stable Diffusion model, Stable Diffusion XL 0.9, could produce higher-resolution images as well, but required more computational might.\u201cStable Diffusion XL 1.0 is customizable, ready for fine-tuning for concepts and styles,\u201d Penna said. \u201cIt\u2019s also easier to use, capable of complex designs with basic natural language processing prompting.\u201dStable Diffusion XL 1.0 is improved in the area of text generation, in addition. While many of the best text-to-image models struggle to generate images with legible logos, much less calligraphy or fonts, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 is capable of \u201cadvanced\u201d text generation and legibility, Penna says.And, as reported by SiliconAngle and VentureBeat, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 supports inpainting (reconstructing missing parts of an image), outpainting (extending existing images) and \u201cimage-to-image\u201d prompts \u2014 meaning users can input an image and add some text prompts to create more detailed variations of that picture. Moreover, the model understands complicated, multi-part instructions given in short prompts, whereas previous Stable Diffusion models needed longer text prompts.An image generated by Stable Diffusion XL 1.0. Image Credits: Stability AI\u201cWe hope that by releasing this much more powerful open source model, the resolution of the images will not be the only thing that quadruples, but also advancements that will greatly benefit all users,\u201d he added.But as with previous versions of Stable Diffusion, the model raises sticky moral issues.The open source version of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 can, in theory, be used by bad actors to generate toxic or harmful content, like nonconsensual deepfakes. That\u2019s partially a reflection of the data that was used to train it: millions of images from around the web.Countless tutorials demonstrate how to use Stability AI\u2019s own tools, including DreamStudio, an open source front end for Stable Diffusion, to create deepfakes. Countless others show how to fine-tune the base Stable Diffusion models to generate porn.Penna doesn\u2019t deny that abuse is possible \u2014 and acknowledges that the model contains certain biases, as well. But he added that Stability AI\u2019s taken \u201cextra steps\u201d to mitigate harmful content generation by filtering the model\u2019s training data for \u201cunsafe\u201d imagery, releasing new warnings related to problematic prompts and blocking as many individual problematic terms in the tool as possible.Stable Diffusion XL 1.0\u2019s training set also includes artwork from artists who\u2019ve protested against companies including Stability AI using their work as training data for generative AI models. Stability AI claims that it\u2019s shielded from legal liability by fair use doctrine, at least in the U.S. But that hasn\u2019t stopped several artists and stock photo company Getty Images from filing lawsuits to stop the practice.Stability AI, which has a partnership with startup Spawning to respect \u201copt-out\u201d requests from these artists, says that it hasn\u2019t removed all flagged artwork from its training data sets but that it \u201ccontinues to incorporate artists\u2019 requests.\u201d\u201cWe are constantly improving the safety functionality of Stable Diffusion and are serious about continuing to iterate on these measures,\u201d Penna said. \u201cMoreover, we are committed to respecting artists\u2019 requests to be removed from training data sets.\u201dTo coincide with the release of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, Stability AI is releasing a fine-tuning feature in beta for its API that\u2019ll allow users to use as few as five images to \u201cspecialize\u201d generation on specific people, products and more. The company is also bringing Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 to Bedrock, Amazon\u2019s cloud platform for hosting generative AI models \u2014 expanding on its previously announced collaboration with AWS.The push for partnerships and new capabilities comes as Stability suffers a lull in its commercial endeavors \u2014 facing stiff competition from OpenAI, Midjourney and others. In April, Semafor reported that Stability AI, which has raised over $100 million in venture capital to date, was burning through cash \u2014 spurring the closing of a $25 million convertible note in June and an executive hunt to help ramp up sales.\u201cThe latest SDXL model represents the next step in Stability AI\u2019s innovation heritage and ability to bring the most cutting-edge open access models to market for the AI community,\u201d Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque said in a press release. \u201cUnveiling 1.0 on Amazon Bedrock demonstrates our strong commitment to work alongside AWS to provide the best solutions for developers and our clients.\u201dMore TechCrunchTwitter, now X, took over the @x handle without warning or compensating its ownerOwner of @x Twitter handle says no one reached out ahead of Twitter's rebranding to 'X'As AI porn generators get better, the stakes get higherTesla's margins remind us that it's an automaker, not a tech companyTechCrunch DisruptSept 19-21 San Francisco, CARegister NowSign up for NewslettersSee all newsletters(opens in a new window)DailyWeek in ReviewStartups WeeklyEvent UpdatesAdvertising UpdatesTechCrunch+ AnnouncementsTechCrunch+ EventsTechCrunch+ RoundupEmailSubscribetwitter(opens in a new window)facebook(opens in a new window)linkedin(opens in a new window)reddit(opens in a new window)mail(opens in a new window)Copy Share LinkCopyTagsAIGenerative AIStability AIStable Diffusion",

Even 3.5 billion parameters is absolutely nothing compared to the likes of GPT-3, 3.5, 4, or even the larger open-source language models (e.g. LLaMA-65B). Is it just an engineering challenge that no one has stepped up for yet? Is it a matter of finding enough training data for the scaling up to make sense?replyairgapstopgap 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Diffusion is more parameter-efficient and you quickly saturate the target fidelity, especially with some refiner cascade. It's a solved problem. You do not need more than maybe 4B total. Images are far more redundant than text.In fact, most interesting papers since Imagen show that you get more mileage out of scaling the text encoder part, which is, of course, a Transformer. This is what drives accuracy, text rendering, compositionality, parsing edge cases. In SD 1.5 the text encoder part (CLIP ViT-L/14) takes a measly 123M parameters.[1] In Imagen, it was T5-XXL with 4.6B [2]. I am interested in someone trying to use a really strong encoder baseline \u2013 maybe from a UL2-20B \u2013 to push this tactic further.Seeing as you can throw out diffusion altogether and synthesize images with transformers [3], there is no reason to prioritize the diffusion part as such.1. https://forums.fast.ai/t/stable-diffusion-parameter-budget-a...2. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.114873. https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00704replyEtherlord87 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Images are far more redundant than text.\"A picture is worth a thousand words\" - I wonder how (in)accurate this popular saying turned out to be? :Dreplyelpocko 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm gonna go ahead and say in 2023, one detailed picture (512x512) is worth about 30 words.replySketchySeaBeast 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I guess that depends on the prompt.replyk12sosse 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Do negative prompt tokens count as words?replyShamelessC 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Seeing as you can throw out diffusion altogether and synthesize images with transformers [3]That\u2019s actually how this whole party got started. DALL-E (the first one) was a transformer model trained on image tokens from an early VAE (and text tokens ofc). Researchers from CompVis developed VQGAN in response. OpenAI showed improved fidelity with guided diffusion over ImageNet (classes) and subsequently DALLE2 using pixel space diffusion and cascading up sampling. CompVis responded with Latent Diffusion which used diffusion in the latent space of some new VQGANs.The paper you mention is interesting! They go back to the DALL-E 1 method but train two VQGAN\u2019s for upsampling and increase the parameter count. This is faster, but only faster than originally reported benchmarks using inferior sampling methods for their diffusion. I would be curious if they can beat some of the more recent ones which require as few as 10-20 steps.They also improve on FID/CLIP scores likely by using more parameters. This might be a memory/time trade off though. I would be curious how much more VRAM their model requires compared to SD, MJ, Kandinsky.The same goes for using T5-XXL. You\u2019ll win FID score contests but no one will be able to run it without an A100 or TPU pod.replyairgapstopgap 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> The same goes for using T5-XXLIs this still true in 2023?

Maybe I'm a luddite or whatever lazy quip you'd like to use, but I prefer the story of a human mastering a skill and producing something beyond contextless aesthetic sludge.replyI_am_uncreative 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah, that's why I always laugh when I see people use cars instead of walking 100 miles. It's an inspiring story for people to do marathons, and cars devalue that.replyGabriel_Martin 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Seeing the \"less art needs to exist\" perspective is certainly a first time for me on this topic.reply__loam 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It would be a real shame if low effort AI spam buried people who have dedicated their lives to artistic expression.replynaillo 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The same could have been said when photoshop or CGI tools like blender replaced hand sculpting and hand painting but I think it hasn't been a net negative across the board (I think rather the opposite).replyvouaobrasil 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I believe it has. CGI at the beginning was okay but like all technologies, humans could not resist bring it to a high level of efficiency. Now all CGI movies are pretty bland and barely any effort is brought to storytelling.replypzo 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]A lot of downvotes. I can relate to it a little bit. During beginning of covid I was in SE Asia at airbnb that didn't have laundry machine - since in SE Asia you don't need it generally because there is so many cheap per kg laundry services around. When for the first month I had to hand wash my clothes I really appreciated having a laundry machine after moving to another airbnb that had one - you take some things for granted.But no, I wouldn't want to hand wash my laundry more often. For the same reason probably I still prefer using a lighter when having a BBQ than a flint.replyvouaobrasil 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, humans take many things for granted. That's why it's better to experience a lack of things sometimes because we are just wired to move onto the next thing.As for the downvotes, I don't mind. I try and present a critical view of technology, but I expect the downvotes because almost everyone here has the perspective that technology is a tool and progress is generally a good thing, which are two statements that I wholeheartedly reject.replyNegativeK 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I don't think that trying to convince people to starve themselves a little as your opening analogy is good for your argument.replyvouaobrasil 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I didn't say starve. I just meant to take a break from eating (you know, like between meals?). AI and computer technology has removed the breaks between meals.replyRcouF1uZ4gsC 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I want to appreciate your comment, but I can't.Can you please chisel it on stone tablets for me?That will really help me appreciate it.replydwallin 15 hours ago | parent | prev [\u2013]I think you have this backwards, Capitalism loves scarcity. Scarcity is what allows for supply and demand curves and profit-making opportunities, even better if you can control the scarcity. Capitalist entities are constantly attempting to use laws, technology, and market power to add scarcity to places where it didn't previously exist.replyvouaobrasil 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That is not the whole story. Capitalism likes the following process (if you can say capitalism \"loves\" anything, which isn't quite right. It's more like the abusers of capitalism love this):1. Create scarcity, 2. Flood the market to reap short term gains with market-disrupting technology 3. Creat new scarcity by creating new productsreplySV_BubbleTime 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev [\u2013]I'm pretty sure that lots of things end up being scarce in totalitarian forms of government... food, for one.replyGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | ContactSearch:",

    "content": "EARTH CRISISSCIENTISTS SAY RECYCLING HAS BACKFIRED SPECTACULARLYWE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING!GETTY / FUTURISMReduce, Reuse, RepudiateWhile recycling campaigns can help limit what heads to the landfill, scientists are now saying that it's masked the glaring problem of over-production and de-emphasized other waste reduction strategies that are far more sustainable.In a new essay for The Conversation, an interdisciplinary group of researchers out of the University of Virginia that's been studying the psychology of waste found that many people over-emphasize the recycling aspect of the waste management industry's \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\" slogan. The result, they say, is a major backfiring as the public has come to mistakenly consider recycling a get-out-of-jail-free card, confusing which goods are actually recyclable in the first place and ignoring the growing waste production catastrophe.In a series of experiments, the UV researchers first asked participants first to list \"reduce,\" \"reuse,\" and \"recycle\" by order of efficacy \u2014 the correct answer being the same one in the old slogan \u2014 finding that a whopping 78 percent got it wrong. In a second experiment, the researchers had participants use a computer program to virtually \"sort\" waste into recycling, compost, and landfill bins. Unfortunately, the outcome of that survey was even more stark, with many incorrectly putting non-recyclable waste, such as plastic bags and lightbulbs, into the virtual recycle bin.Cause and EffectWhile over-emphasizing or getting the recycling protocol wrong is an issue on its own, its downstream effects have been devastating as microplastics from consumer waste continue to pollute our oceans, land masses, and bodies \u2014 and as greenhouse gases from the production of all this stuff keep throttling our planet.While lots of governmental bodies are, as the researchers note, attempting to stem and even ban the proliferation of single-use plastic goods such as plastic straws and bags, the industries responsible for creating those landfill-bound items keep making more and more of them, and even their own mitigation strategies are voluntary.The onus to reduce, reuse, and recycle ends up falling on consumers \u2014 who, as the aforementioned studies show, aren't as well-trained on how to do them as we should be. It's a status quo that does little to tackle the global waste crisis and ends up using a lot of logistical and worker power to boot.More on waste: The Ocean's Plastic Pollution Has Spiked to \"Unprecedented\" Levels",
