    "originBody": "Privacy is Priceless, but Signal is Expensive Meredith Whittaker and Joshua Lund on 16 Nov 2023 Signal is the world’s most widely used truly private messaging app, and our cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal app itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work to add a layer of quantum resistance to the Signal Protocol, and our previous work on metadata protection technologies that help keep personal details like your contact list, group membership, profile name, and other intimate information secure. This singular focus on preserving the ability to communicate privately is one reason that we work in the open, documenting our thinking and making our code open source and open to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it. Signal is also a nonprofit, unlike almost every other consumer tech company.1 This provides an essential structural safeguard ensuring that we stay true to our privacy-focused mission. To put it bluntly, as a nonprofit we don’t have investors or profit-minded board members knocking during hard times, urging us to “sacrifice a little privacy” in the name of hitting growth and monetary targets. This is important in an industry where “free” consumer tech is almost always underwritten by monetizing surveillance and invading privacy. Such practices are often accompanied by “growth hacking” and engagement maximization techniques that leverage dark patterns to keep people glued to feeds and notifications. While Signal is also free to use, we reject this kind of manipulation, focusing instead on creating a straightforward interpersonal communications app. We also reject business models that incentivize such practices. Instead of monetizing surveillance, we’re supported by donations, including a generous initial loan from Brian Acton. Our goal is to move as close as possible to becoming fully supported by small donors, relying on a large number of modest contributions from people who care about Signal. We believe this is the safest form of funding in terms of sustainability: ensuring that we remain accountable to the people who use Signal, avoiding any single point of funding failure, and rejecting the widespread practice of monetizing surveillance. But our nonprofit structure doesn’t mean it costs less for Signal to produce a globally distributed communications app. Signal is a nonprofit, but we’re playing in a lane dominated by multi-billion-dollar corporations that have defined the norms and established the tech ecosystem, and whose business models directly contravene our privacy mission. So in order to provide a genuinely useful alternative, Signal spends tens of millions of dollars every year. We estimate that by 2025, Signal will require approximately $50 million dollars a year to operate—and this is very lean compared to other popular messaging apps that don’t respect your privacy. Here we review some of these costs and where this money goes, in the name of providing more transparency into Signal. But we hope to do more than that. Where money goes and how it’s made is a bit of a taboo in tech, something that most tech companies avoid talking about. The actual costs of consumer tech are generally hidden behind stories of innovation and the word “free,” and the connection between the product marketing of a highly profitable tech industry and the ingress and egress of profit and revenue is usually unclear. We believe a material map of these dynamics can help clarify just what is required to fulfill the dream of privacy-preserving alternative technology, and contribute to establishing a solid foundation from which we can grow alternatives that contest tech surveillance and the incentives behind it. This is not a comprehensive overview—this post isn’t meant to provide a full accounting or to review every line item in detail. Instead, we focus on illustrative examples, looking at infrastructure and labor in particular. We’ll also explore average costs that in practice vary dynamically in relation to factors that are often outside of our control.2 Infrastructurally Different We’ll start with an overview of some of Signal’s biggest infrastructural costs—what we pay for the utilities and services that let Signal reach you. These include the temporary storage of end-to-end encrypted data for message delivery; the global server network that processes billions of requests every day; the registration fees that cover the delivery of verification codes during the sign-up process to help verify phone numbers and prevent spam accounts; the bandwidth that is required to efficiently route end-to-end encrypted messages and calls around the world; and some of the additional services that keep everything running smoothly. We’ll dive into each of these in more detail, but here’s a quick breakdown: Storage: $1.3 million dollars per year. Servers: $2.9 million dollars per year. Registration Fees: $6 million dollars per year. Total Bandwidth: $2.8 million dollars per year. Additional Services:3 $700,000 dollars per year. Current Infrastructure Costs (as of November 2023): Approximately $14 million dollars per year. The Cost of Storing Nothing and Serving Everyone Data is profitable, and we’re a nonprofit focused on collecting as little data as possible. Most tech companies collect and create as much data as they can. They build large data warehouses, and then later invent new terms like “data lake” when their unquenchable thirst for more of your private information can no longer fit within the confines of a single warehouse. Their default move is to store everything for as long as they can in an easily accessible and unencrypted format, suffering data breach, after data breach, after data breach, hoping to monetize this data by indirectly (or directly) selling it to advertisers or using it to train AI models. Again, data is profitable. In contrast, Signal’s default move is to end-to-end encrypt everything that we possibly can and to store as little as possible—all while making sure your messages are delivered promptly and your calls are clear and free of delays. We do this by taking advantage of globally distributed hosting infrastructure and by paying for significant amounts of bandwidth from some of the top providers in the world. Just like everything else in Signal, messages and files are always end-to-end encrypted. When you send a message, the Signal service temporarily queues that message for delivery. As soon as your message is delivered, that small bundle of encrypted data (i.e. your message) can be dropped from the queue. The storage of end-to-end encrypted files is temporary too, and any undelivered end-to-end encrypted data is automatically purged after a period of inactivity. Even though everything is only temporary, this storage still costs Signal around $1.3 million dollars per year. This is a lot of money, although it’s less than it would cost if we stored everything forever. But unlike the tech companies that collect and store everything, we don’t have (and do not want to have) any surveillance data to sell or use to recoup these costs. We can’t read or access any end-to-end encrypted messages because the keys that are required to decrypt them are in your hands, not ours. And it’s not just about your messages. Signal also uses our metadata encryption technology to protect intimate information about who is communicating with whom—we don’t know who is sending you messages, and we don’t have access to your address book or profile information. We believe that the inability to monetize encrypted data is one of the reasons that strong end-to-end encryption technology has not been widely deployed across the commercial tech industry. In order to provide a globally accessible, reliable, and high-performance communications service for the many millions of people around the world who depend on Signal, it’s necessary for Signal’s servers to be globally distributed. Having a geographically distributed network of servers is particularly important for end-to-end encrypted voice and video calls, because latency can result in audio delays or degraded video connections that quickly make the app unusable for real-time communication. Because everything in Signal is end-to-end encrypted, we can rent server infrastructure from a variety of providers like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure, and others while ensuring that your messages and calls remain private and secure. We can’t access them, and neither can the companies that provide any of the infrastructure we rent. As a small nonprofit organization, we cannot afford to purchase all of the physical computers that are necessary to support everyone who relies on Signal while also placing them in independent data centers around the world. Only a select few of the very largest companies globally are still capable of doing this, which is a hallmark of a troublingly concentrated industry.4 Signal’s addition of novel privacy-preserving features also affects our server costs. To pick one example, we developed a new approach to private contact discovery in 2017 that uses a trusted execution environment. This made us the first large-scale messaging app to let people automatically find their friends and contacts without revealing their address book to us, keeping these connections private. Because other mainstream apps don’t have this layer of privacy protection in place, they can often access details about your network and relationships without restrictions, and many of them store this highly sensitive information for later use.5 When we first deployed this system in 2017, only a few servers were necessary. But as the number of people using Signal increased, the number of servers required to support private contact discovery also rose. At its peak, nearly 600 servers were dedicated to private contact discovery alone, at a total cost of more than $2 million dollars per year. This significant cost would have continued to rise. However, thanks to algorithmic research advances and hardware updates, we’ve been able to reduce the total number of private contact discovery servers to around 10 total—despite the fact that the service is handling more traffic than ever. A significant amount of money and engineering resources have been dedicated to ensuring that your address book remains completely inaccessible to us, and Signal will continue to push the envelope and introduce new techniques to enhance your privacy even when the initial costs are high. Registration Fees Signal incurs expenses when people download Signal and sign up for an account, or when they re-register on a new device. We use third-party services to send a registration code via SMS or voice call in order to verify that the person in possession of a given phone number actually intended to sign up for a Signal account. This is a critical step in helping to prevent spam accounts from signing up for the service and rendering it completely unusable—a non-trivial problem for any popular messaging app. Signal’s registration service routes registration codes over multiple telephony providers to optimize delivery across the globe, and the fees we pay to third-party vendors for every verification code we send can be very high. This is in part, we believe, because legacy telecom operators have realized that SMS messages are now used primarily for app registration and two-factor authentication in many places, as people switch to calling and texting services that rely on network data. In response to increased verification traffic from apps like Signal, and decreased SMS revenue from their own customers, these service providers have significantly raised their SMS rates in many locations, assuming (correctly) that tech companies will have to pay anyway. The cost of these registration services for verifying phone numbers when people first install Signal, or when they re-register on a new device, currently averages around $6 million dollars per year. These costs vary dramatically from month to month, and the rates that we pay are sometimes inflated due to “toll fraud”—a practice where some network operators split revenue with fraudulent actors to drive increased volumes of SMS and calling traffic on their network. The telephony providers that apps like Signal rely on to send verification codes during the registration process still charge their own customers for this make-believe traffic, which can increase registration costs in ways that are often unpredictable. Of course, Signal does everything we can to reduce or eliminate the impact of toll fraud. We work closely with our voice and SMS verification providers to detect and shut down fraudulent registrations as quickly as possible. But it’s still a game of cat and mouse, with unavoidable expenses along the way. The Going Rate for Transfer Rates You are probably familiar with the concept of paying for bandwidth in the form of buying a data plan from your cellular provider or signing up with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for your home. But it may surprise you to learn that every website, app, and service also pays for the bandwidth they use whenever you connect to them. Some pay more than others. Most of the major tech companies (like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) own and operate their own data centers. After spending billions of dollars to build massive hosting facilities, they install their own fiber optic cables and custom networking equipment. This also means they get to earn a lot of money by charging others for the privilege of using that equipment.6 Smaller organizations like Signal can’t afford to build matching infrastructure from scratch, so we (along with almost every startup and tech company) pay rent to the big players in order to access the bandwidth we need. Millions of people use Signal every day, and it takes a lot of bandwidth to provide a fast and reliable service. Signal spends around $2.8 million dollars per year on bandwidth to support sending messages and files (such as photos, videos, voice notes, documents, etc.) and to enable voice and video calls. Voice and video calls require significantly more bandwidth than text messages, and Signal’s end-to-end encrypted calling functionality is one of the most expensive services that we provide. Signal also goes far beyond other messaging apps when it comes to protecting your privacy during voice and video calls, and we do this in ways that substantially increase how much bandwidth we use in order to provide a high-quality calling experience. To take one example, Signal always routes end-to-end encrypted calls from people who aren’t in your contacts through a relay server that obscures IP address information.7 Almost none of our competitors do this, and Signal’s default behavior is much more expensive than the alternative. Automatically relaying 1-on-1 voice and video calls from unknown contacts (instead of always using a peer-to-peer connection whenever possible) provides an extra layer of privacy, but results in considerably higher bandwidth costs for Signal’s calling-related relay servers. At current traffic levels, the amount of outbound bandwidth that is required to support Signal voice and video calls is around 20 petabytes per year (that’s 20 million gigabytes) which costs around $1.7 million dollars per year in bandwidth fees just for calling, and that figure doesn’t include the development costs associated with hiring experienced engineers to maintain our calling software, or the cost of the necessary server infrastructure to support those calls. The Human Touch Signal isn’t just a collection of privacy-preserving services that route end-to-end encrypted messages and calls around the world. It’s also a set of cross-platform apps and modular development components (commonly called libraries) that make this type of private communication possible in the first place. Because the norm is surveillance, we’re often required to create or modify our own libraries from scratch, swapping in privacy instead of using more common frameworks that assume surveillant defaults. Swimming against the tide of an ecosystem whose incentives and infrastructure promote surveillance and privacy invasions is, of course, more time-intensive and more expensive, and requires dedicated and experienced people. First, we have three distinct client teams, one for each platform (Android, Desktop, and iOS). These teams are constantly working: adjusting to operating system updates, building new features, and making sure the app works on a wide variety of devices and hardware configurations. We also have dedicated engineering teams that handle the development and maintenance of the Signal Server and all of its infrastructure, our calling libraries like RingRTC, and core libraries like libsignal. These also need constant development and monitoring. Product and design teams help shape the future of the app and determine how it will look and function, while our localization team coordinates translation efforts across more than sixty languages. We even have a full-time, in-house support group that interfaces with people who use Signal and provides detailed technical feedback and real-time troubleshooting information to every other team. This is an essential function, particularly at Signal, because we don’t collect analytics or telemetry data about how people are using Signal. This is a lot of work, and we do it with a small and mighty team. In total, around 50 full-time employees currently work on Signal, a number that is shockingly small by industry standards. For example, LINE Corporation, the developers of the LINE messaging app popular in Japan, has around 3,100 employees,8 while the division of Kakao Corp that develops KakaoTalk, a messaging app popular in Korea, has around 4,000 employees.9 Employee counts at bigger corporations like Apple, Meta, and Google’s parent company (Alphabet) are much, much higher.10 To sustain our ongoing development efforts, about half of Signal’s overall operating budget goes towards recruiting, compensating, and retaining the people who build and care for Signal. When benefits, HR services, taxes, recruiting, and salaries are included, this translates to around $19 million dollars per year. We are proud to pay people well. Our goal is to compensate our staff at as close to industry wages as possible within the boundaries of a nonprofit organization. We know that we can’t provide equity, expensive playpen offices, or other benefits common to large tech companies. We also know that we need to recruit and retain a highly experienced and specialized workforce in an extremely competitive industry if we’re going to offer a service that provides a meaningful alternative to apps with far more people and resources. And we don’t believe that precarity should be the cost of doing good. Compared to most tech companies, Signal’s numbers are a drop in the bucket.11 Growth in Signal translates into increased infrastructure costs, and having more infrastructure requires more labor. As of November 2023, Signal’s server network is regularly responding to around 100,000 requests per second, and we routinely break our previous records. A funny thing happens when a globally accessible service starts handling billions of requests every day. Suddenly one-in-a-million possibilities are no longer unique or rare, and unlikely situations become more and more common as Signal grows. It’s not unusual for our engineers to do things like write custom code to reproduce an esoteric and complicated IPv6 connectivity issue that’s affecting people running an arcane operating system configuration in specific regions, but only when connected via a certain set of internet service providers.12 Troubleshooting such infrastructure issues can be very expensive, because isolating a problem and developing a fix can take a lot of time and expertise. Identifying and fixing arcane problems is not the only thing that takes time and skill. In the context of building for privacy, adding a common feature or service in a way that avoids surveillance frequently requires significant work and creativity. To take one example, profile pictures and profile names are always end-to-end encrypted in Signal. This means that Signal does not have access to your profile name or chosen profile photo. This approach is unique in the industry. In fact, it has been more than six years since we first announced this additional layer of protection, and as far as we know none of our competitors have yet adopted it. Other messengers can easily see your profile photo, profile name, and other sensitive information that Signal cannot access. Our choice here reflects our staunch commitment to privacy, but it also means that it took Signal more effort to implement support for profile photos. Instead of a weekend project for a single engineer, our teams were required to develop new approaches and concepts within the codebase (like profile keys), which they worked to roll out across multiple platforms after an extended testing period. The same dynamic played out again when Signal introduced support for animated GIF searches on Android and iOS. Instead of quickly and easily integrating the standard GIF search SDK that most other apps were using, engineers spent considerable time and creativity developing another unique privacy-preserving technique that hides GIF search terms from Signal’s servers, while also hiding who is searching for those terms from the GIF search engine itself. We later expanded those techniques to further obfuscate GIF search information by obscuring the amount of traffic that passes through the proxied connection. When Meta acquired GIPHY, and many other apps were scrambling to contend with the privacy implications of the deal, Signal employees slept soundly knowing that we had already built this feature correctly several years earlier.13 Even more recently, Signal has started taking steps to protect today’s conversations from future threats by adding post-quantum resistance to the Signal Protocol. The financial costs associated with these research and development initiatives are substantial. They’re also essential for building privacy-preserving technology in a dynamic industry where surveillance is the norm. By offering a competitive compensation package, Signal helps make it easy for people to choose to develop privacy-preserving technology that benefits the world instead of going to work for the surveillance-advertising-industrial complex. We’re proud of our healthcare plans, family-friendly policies like extended parental leave, flexible schedules, and the many other benefits that help make Signal a great place to work. These things cost money, but a world where Signal can attract talented people to work on privacy-preserving technology is a world that looks a lot more attractive. Future Tense We hope that this cursory tour of some of Signal’s operations and costs helps provide a greater understanding of Signal’s unique place in the tech ecosystem, and of the tech ecosystem itself. Our goal of developing an open source private messenger that is supported and sustained by small donations is both highly ambitious and, we believe, existentially important. The cost of most consumer technology is underwritten by surveillance, which has allowed people to assume that “free” is the default, and a handful of industry players have accrued eye-watering amounts of personal data and the unprecedented power to use that data in ways that are shaping our lives and institutions globally. To put it another way, the social costs of normalized privacy invasion are staggeringly high, and maintaining and caring for alternative technology has never been more important. Signal is working to show that a different approach is possible—an approach that puts privacy at the center, and where organizations are accountable to the people who use and rely on their services, not to investors, or to the endless pursuit of growth and profit.

Suffice it to say, Signal does not have this kind of cash laying around. ↩ Unlike Signal, many big tech companies know who you are talking to and can easily correlate messaging activity with social media activity. The European Commission, for example, imposed a fine of €110 million euros because Facebook had misled regulators about this very possibility during the WhatsApp acquisition process. ↩ In their 2022 annual report, Alphabet announced that “Google Cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022.” Not all of this revenue comes from bandwidth fees, but there’s a reason why “Networking Egress” gets its own tab on the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator. ↩ Signal also includes an optional feature that will use a relay server for every call—even when an incoming call is from someone you know: (Privacy > Advanced > Always Relay Calls). ↩ “About,” LINE Corporation, accessed November 9, 2023, https://linecorp.com/en/company/info. ↩ Kakao’s Q3 2023 Earnings Presentation (page 14) also specifies an overall employee count of 17,208. ↩ Neither Alphabet, nor Apple, nor Meta break out specific employee counts for the individual business units that work on their messaging and calling platforms. Alphabet reported an employee count of 182,381 in their Q3 2023 fiscal results, Apple has “more than 100,000 employees” according to their 2023 fourth quarter fiscal results, and Meta’s “headcount was 66,185 as of September 30, 2023.” ↩ As of their Q3 2023 financial report, Meta “had $37.22 billion available and authorized for [share] repurchases” alone. ↩ For the networking enthusiasts out there, a piece of networking infrastructure operated by a major cloud provider was responding to SYN packets in a way that indicated it supported connections without TCP window scaling when that wasn’t actually the case. TCP windows then appeared to the client as being 8 times smaller than the value that the cloud provider thought they were, which led to the clients being unable to send data because they were running out of receive windows. The cloud provider wasn’t refilling the windows, as they appeared to be almost full on their side. ↩ Meta has since sold Giphy to Shutterstock, losing over $260 million dollars in the process. In this era of expanding consolidation, you never know where your data may end up. The only winning move for services that care about your privacy is to not collect any sensitive data in the first place. ↩ Tweet Facebook Don't have Signal? Give it a try!",

It doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything productive, yet here we are. The key point is to understand that this is caused by Wikipedia having too much funding, not too little. As internet denizens, we can be proud that an open source store of knowledge has money to blow on wasteful consulting, and then proceed to create our ublock filters worry free.This is different than what is currently going on with venture backed services like reddit and youtube. I would argue that we should block ads there too, but there it is an arms race where we have to consider ways to protect ourselves from encroaching privacy violations.

I usually at least double (usually more) my incurred cost when the donation is optional, to cover for those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t pay, but paying 240× the cost price seems wasteful as well when there are other nonprofits that can do more good with every dollar you give them (be it solving poverty, climate change, whatever you find valuable) rather than one which has mostly fixed fees reply Canada 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not suggesting every chat service get donations. I&#x27;m only giving to Signal, the rest of the chat services I have to use get 0.I&#x27;m donating more than my costs deliberately because I fully understand that most users are not going to contribute money, full stop. I need those users though, because they are the people I want to privately communicate with. So the obvious thing to do is pay for as many other users as I can. If there&#x27;s 50M monthly active users, and if 1% of them are like me and highly value Signal, then each of us 1% users can pay $20&#x2F;month and cover the entire operation. Then the contributions of the super rich donors can be saved to rebuild the war chest.$20&#x2F;month is nothing to me considering the value I get.

Until then, we&#x27;ll keep using Signal. reply rglullis 2 hours agorootparentFirst, you talk like Signal never had any issue with usability or functionality, which is far from the truth. Signal amount of bugs and security issues with their client is notorious, and the insistence of requiring phone numbers is just a silly \"let them have cake approach\" that is conveniently ignored for too long.Second, are you hedging your bets and supporting Matrix or XMPP as well, or will you only encourage people to \"donate\" to the platform that you happen to have picked already? reply Canada 51 minutes agorootparentYes, I am encouraging people to donate to Signal because I prefer it. Why would I be soliciting donations for something I don&#x27;t favor? If you want to contribute to something else go right ahead, but this is a thread about Signal&#x27;s financial needs so it shouldn&#x27;t surprise you that Signal supporters encourage other supporters to donate.I also use Matrix. Element has been pretty good for a few years now, but it&#x27;s still not smooth enough for mainstream use. (Encryption state in chats gets messed up sometimes, for example. It feels like Signal 10 years ago, and it&#x27;s had security issues in its client also)The Matrix protocol is also inferior to Signal in that all metadata is stored in cleartext on the server. You get to choose or run a server, but the protocol still leaks the user info to whoever runs the home server and to any foreign server that has a user in the same channel if you are using it in a federated context. Signal manages all of this by peer to peer messages where cleartext is only available to clients, which is really slick.XMPP is just dead. Forget about XMPP. Matrix is the clear leader in the federated messaging system category. I&#x27;d like to see Matrix displace things like Telegram, Discord, and Slack.

Either way, a Tor-like model would have security benefits over a centralized system like Signal, right? reply bastawhiz 7 hours agorootparentTor is distributed, not federated. And it has drawbacks, like high latency and a lack of a centralized system for human-friendly names (because that would mean a system like DNS, which is centralized). As far as security goes, there&#x27;s probably little benefit. E2EE doesn&#x27;t get more secure because there&#x27;s more encryption.The most comparable system to Tor that has practical properties I can think of is maybe ipfs, but nobody will store your encrypted chat blobs for you out of the goodness of their hearts. Ipfs also tends to have high latency. A slow system of uncooperative nodes isn&#x27;t what you want your messaging app built on.A federated messaging system looks a lot more like Matrix. The obvious problems are that splitting users up over multiple nodes mean encrypted data doesn&#x27;t live on your instance, it lives everywhere the people are you chat with. Another problem is what you see with bsky, where identifiers come with a domain name (like an email).IRC is also federated (sort of), and there&#x27;s a long list of tired, age-old problems. The most common one is simple: different servers have different features, so you can&#x27;t reliably \"just use it\" like you can with Signal. replyclimb_stealth 14 hours agoparentprevSame.

So 5000 HD video calls all year round.Signal is known for the large bandwidth needed for calling but that sounds too much and not really scalable in the future. reply jhgg 3 minutes agoparentPaying 2.8m for 20pb of bandwidth is two orders of magnitude more expensive than it needs to be.

But there are edge cases and tools like these often have utilities in domains that might not be common to the average person but are to specific groups. For example, these are often used in situations where cash is preferable but you wouldn&#x27;t want to cary that around, like real estate down payments and buying a car. Some settings are sensitive to the exchange times (though that money looks like it is in your account instantly, it isn&#x27;t).I just wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to make such a conclusion because it&#x27;s pretty likely that your experience is not general.

I don&#x27;t know anywhere you can buy or or borrow a DID with Monero anymore. Looks like they got to Telnum recently.You can still buy a SIM, a prepaid PIN, and a phone with cash, but you&#x27;d need to pay a non-correlated person to be seen on CCTV to do it, at a non-correlated time, and hope they don&#x27;t just take your money and leave you nothing at the dead drop.Then there&#x27;s the hassle of setting up the account in a way that&#x27;s not correlated with your location, normal waking hours, etc.All of this could just be avoided if Signal did the right thing.But they won&#x27;t. Ask yourself why. reply pizzafeelsright 13 hours agorootparentWhy are you typing my comments?Exactly.

This has nothing to do with the privacy of Signal.I buy all of my anonymous prepaid SIMs with cash at retail myself, and they are still anonymous.The only time you’d need to stay off CCTV is if you were using them to commit crimes and expected a significant investigation to be undertaken.Your casual assertion of malice on the part of Signal is not supported by any facts. reply groby_b 15 hours agorootparentprevSure, but privacy isn&#x27;t black or white. A donation to signal does not compromise the content of your messaging.So what you&#x27;ve leaked is the information that you have an interest in private conversations. This might be a problem in some countries, but I think it&#x27;s fair to ask folks in affluent countries with working (sorta) democracies to shoulder that burden. I.e. you don&#x27;t donate if there&#x27;s elevated threat to your safety, there are enough people who aren&#x27;t under elevated threat.There&#x27;s also the possibility of using a donation mixer like Silent Donor, though I&#x27;d evaluate that very carefully. (There&#x27;s a record of the transfer in, and the mixer needs to keep temporary records for transferring out. There&#x27;s also the question how you verify the mixer doesn&#x27;t skim.)Some donation mixers accept crypto currency, so for maximum paranoia, I suppose crypto->crypto mixer->donation mixer->charity might be workable. Or hand cash to a friend who donates in your stead.As always, the best path is to set aside paranoia and build a threat model instead to see what the actual risks are. reply godelski 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s never enough talk like this and I&#x27;m not sure why. It&#x27;s always about the threat model. In this respect I always like to think of it in terms of probability. Probabilities and likelihoods aren&#x27;t just about capturing randomness like quantum fluctuations or rolling dice, they are fundamentally about capturing uncertainty. Your threat model is your conditions and you can only calculate likelihoods as you don&#x27;t know everything. There are no guarantees of privacy or security. This is why I always hated the conversations around when Signal was discussing deleting messages and people were saying that it&#x27;s useless because someone could have saved the message before you deleted them. But this is also standard practice in industry because they understand the probabilistic framework and that there&#x27;s a good chance that you delete before they save. Framing privacy and security as binary&#x2F;deterministic options doesn&#x27;t just do a poor but \"good enough approximation\" of these but actually leads you to make decisions that would decrease your privacy and security!It&#x27;s like brute forcing, we just want something where we&#x27;d be surprised if someone could accomplish it within the lifetime of the universe though technically it is possible for them to get it on the very first try if they are very very lucky. Which is an extreme understatement. It&#x27;s far more likely that you could walk up to a random door, put the wrong key in, have the door&#x27;s lock fall out of place, and open it to find a bear, a methhead, and a Rabbi sitting around a table drinking tea, playing cards, and the Rabbi has a full house.

They said it was costing millions to have that enabled for them.Previous Twitter employees have said that this is incorrect. Because Twitter began as an SMS-only (and then SMS-first) application (remember 40404?), they very early on established direct-connection infrastructure for sending SMS, meaning that they have a marginal cost of literally $0.00&#x2F;message in most markets. Twitter still has to maintain that infrastructure, because they didn&#x27;t get rid of SMS 2FA - they just restricted it to Twitter Blue users, so the overhead is still the same.Almost nobody else who delivers SMS today has that infrastructure, because it doesn&#x27;t make sense for most services to build.The only place where Twitter was paying significant amounts for SMS was due to SMS pump schemes, which is a consequence of Twitter gutting its anti-spam detection, resulting in them paying for SMS pumping which was previously blocked. reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agorootparent> they very early on established direct-connection infrastructure for sending SMS, meaning that they have a marginal cost of literally $0.00&#x2F;message in most markets.I am very, very interested to understand how that works, because without more detail or sources I&#x27;m calling bullshit. I definitely understand how Twitter could have greatly reduced their per-message fee with telecom providers, but at the end of the day Twitter is not a telecom and is still at the mercy of whoever is that \"last mile\" for actually delivering the SMS to your phone, so I don&#x27;t understand how they have no marginal cost here. Happy to be proven wrong. reply toast0 15 hours agorootparentCarriers that run their own messaging infrastructure can allow for direct connections from 3rd parties, and set the price per message to whatever they want, including zero.For something like Twitter where you could post by SMS, the balance of traffic might have been such that giving Twitter free outbound SMS was balanced by the charges incurred by customers sending to Twitter&#x27;s shortcode. Or it might just be balanced by increased customer happiness when they can use the product more effectively.If the carrier doesn&#x27;t run their own messaging infra, they might be paying their IT provider on a per message basis, and might not be able or willing to set the messaging rate to zero.For a use case where SMS is used to show control of a phone number, getting a zero cost direct route is a harder sell, but it can happen if the routing through aggregators is poor and the carrier is concerned about that, or if there&#x27;s some other larger agreement in play. reply peanut-walrus 14 hours agorootparentIf you require global connectivity, managing hundreds of carrier APIs, contracts, etc seems like major overhead. Also, there are companies whose only purpose for existing is providing messaging, like Twilio, are they just...not doing this or do the carriers just not play ball? In that case, why would the carriers agree to sell to you at a discount? reply toast0 14 hours agorootparentAggregators do some of this, and they can negotiate pricing to some degree, but a carrier is unlikely to intentionally give them zero cost traffic, and even if they do, they&#x27;re not going to pass that through at zero cost.I ran the engineering side of carrier integrations at WhatsApp. Carriers wanted to sell data plans with special pricing for data with WA and use WA branding in advertising, because it attracted customers that might later convert to a bigger general purpose data plan. As part of that, we would ask for zero rated SMS to their customers for verification. When it was available, it was generally faster and higher success vs sending messages through an aggregator.We also had some, usually small, carriers approach us asking us to set up direct routes to them for verification, because their customers would not always receive our messages when we sent through an aggregator. Early in my career at WA, we would just send these carriers to our aggregator contacts, and often things would get linked up and then we&#x27;d still pay $&#x2F;message but it would work better. As we got a little bigger and built support for direct routes anyway, it was usually not too hard to set up a direct connection and then there&#x27;d be no cost for that carrier. Messing around with IPSEC VPNs and SMPP isn&#x27;t fun and the GSMA SOAP messaging APIs are way worse, but once you get the first couple implementations done, it becomes cookie cutter (and FB had built way better tools for this, and a 24&#x2F;7 support team, so I never had to be up, on the phone with telco peeps at 3 am kicking racoon or whatever ipsec daemon we were running until it finally connected) reply amluto 4 hours agorootparentCan you say what ordinary (non-discounted) pricing was like, per message? At least in the US, most carriers did I and, believe, still do operate free SMTP -> SMS gateways. They worked okay, although they resulted in oddly formatted messages. reply toast0 4 hours agorootparentTwilio has a public price sheet[1], I think they haven&#x27;t actually updated this one lately, but it&#x27;s a good representation of what ordinary pricing is like. This is not an endorsement (or non-endorsement) of Twilio, but having a public price sheet makes it easy to link to them.In general, pricing varies widely by destination (country and sometimes carrier), US and some other places areSMS gateways sometimes work in the US, but they don&#x27;t work much in other countries, and they&#x27;re not good enough to rely on if your product requires an SMS during the new user flow. SMS costs are real and it&#x27;s frustrating, but if it costs too much, you need to use something other than phone numbers for ids; I don&#x27;t think skirting by with email gateways is going to work. But, if you build dynamic routing, I guess you could try.Also, you&#x27;ve got the use the right email gateway for the user&#x27;s carrier, and a carrier lookup is on the order of $0.01, unless you have tons of volume, so for the US, you might as well pay for the SMS.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.cdn.prod.twilio.com&#x2F;pricing-csv&#x2F;SMSPricing.cs... reply hn_throwaway_99 11 hours agorootparentprevThanks very much for sharing your experience and detail!

If I tell the telecoms that I want to send a billion messages per year it seems like they might be willing to take a lump sum instead of setting up the systems to bill based on usage.In most of the world, SMS is billed per-message, so it&#x27;s basically no extra effort on the Telecoms side at all.

In response to increased verification traffic from apps like Signal, and decreased SMS revenue from their own customers, these service providers have significantly raised their SMS rates in many locations, assuming (correctly) that tech companies will have to pay anyway....These costs vary dramatically from month to month, and the rates that we pay are sometimes inflated due to “toll fraud”—a practice where some network operators split revenue with fraudulent actors to drive increased volumes of SMS and calling traffic on their network. The telephony providers that apps like Signal rely on to send verification codes during the registration process still charge their own customers for this make-believe traffic, which can increase registration costs in ways that are often unpredictable. reply sowbug 13 hours agorootparentSMS has become a kind of real-world PoW (proof of work) mechanism. A phone number typically has a recurring fee to keep it working. So a live number indicates that someone is spending money (a proxy for effort) to maintain it.*It still seems like a lot of money to spend on simple, old technology, but from the PoW perspective, making it cheaper would defeat its purpose.*Which is why many sites reject Google Voice numbers, for example, for SMS verification. reply thaumasiotes 7 hours agorootparentprev> In response to increased verification traffic from apps like Signal, and decreased SMS revenue from their own customers, these service providers have significantly raised their SMS rates in many locations, assuming (correctly) that tech companies will have to pay anyway.There&#x27;s nothing that requires tech companies to use SMS for registration or for 2FA. The normal way to do it is by email, which continues to be free.

Middle-schoolers and high-schoolers are encouraged to communicate via a chat application with rich multimedia functionality.

Logically, the obvious party to do so the carrier providing network access to the device, which also has a recurring billing relationship with the user from which to recoup its costs, and that the user knows to contact when they have issues. As a standard ostensibly replacing SMS, and coming out of the GSMA, it&#x27;s also pretty obvious it&#x27;d be biased toward a carrier-centric solution.There are a couple other options of course, but I am not sure they are better:* Fully federate this, a la Matrix or XMPP. I really wish this was a practical option, but without legislation I doubt any company wants to go willingly in this direction. Even if they did, it&#x27;d be difficult to contain spam at scale. It also creates &#x27;first contact&#x27; issues; love it or hate it, the general public seem attached to the idea of phone numbers and it seems to work relatively well and unambiguously. It is also the most technically complicated and most brittle and unpredictable for users.* Phone &#x2F; OS maker operates it for their devices.

Currently, the only messaging app on Android that fully supports RCS is Messages by Google, which is closed source and requires Google Play Services to activate RCS features.Also, end-to-end encryption is not part of the RCS specification, but is a proprietary extension to RCS that Google has made exclusive to Messages by Google.[1] This feature should be made open and added to the actual RCS specification so that Apple and other vendors can make use of it.(Notes: There is a proprietary RCS API which Google only allows Samsung apps to use to communicate with Messages by Google.[2] Verizon has an app called Verizon Messages or Message+ that uses RCS to some extent, but this is an incomplete implementation that only works on Samsung devices on the Verizon network with no cross-carrier compatibility.[3])[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;google-enables-end-t...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;google-messages-rcs-api-third...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verizon.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;knowledge-base-222792&#x2F; reply hbn 14 hours agoparentThis is why I don&#x27;t buy Google&#x27;s bad faith shaming of Apple for not adopting RCS. The current version of it that people are using on Android isn&#x27;t even a \"standard\" by any normal usage of the term, it&#x27;s just another Google messaging service. No one can make their own app, and there&#x27;s barely any carrier adoption, so Google is basically running the whole network.Does this mean that now if you send a message to someone from an iPhone that doesn&#x27;t go through iMessage, it will instead go through Google&#x27;s servers? Sure the service will hopefully be better than SMS but at the cost of giving Google the keys to pretending they&#x27;re a \"standard.\" reply spiralpolitik 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the trap door in this. Apple is going to implement RCS exactly as the specification says it should be implemented, no more or no less. Any incompatibilities with Android will be laid at Google&#x27;s door to resolve.Having beaten Apple with the RCS stick for the last year, Google might find themselves now getting beaten back. reply matwood 8 hours agorootparentApple also stated they would work to add encryption to the RCS spec, poking Google in the eye with their proprietary model.

If this is supposed to be a standard, there&#x27;s no way for a third-party to use Google&#x27;s RCS APIs right now.

Messaging integration between iOS and Android, in the US at least, is not just fundamentally broken, but the presence of a single Android user in an iMessage group chat can break the experience for everyone (e.g. potato quality video), and if you are the \"odd man out\" on the Android people start resenting your presence in the chat (and, to be clear, I&#x27;m middle aged, not in middle school). For an example, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CwLKeGRLieb&#x2F;There is no reason for there to be such messaging incompatibility between iOS and Android.

Android developers aren’t given access the way they were to SMS, and nobody except Samsung is allowed to use their proprietary E2EE servers.I think this is basically Apple calling their bluff and telling them that they need to actually release their proprietary work as open standards.

I’m sure that will be their argument to regulators.Which would be a great outcome! reply rickdeckard 3 hours agorootparentCorrection: The CARRIERS intended to all host a own RCS server, before Google was even part of the picture.The idea was for every carrier to be the gatekeeper of his subscribers, so no one was giving up anything and everyone wins. The strongest carriers in the working group rolled out their own servers in the initial stage of development, a total of five only IIRC. No one else followed because there was no visibility on return of investment.At that time, major device vendors maintained their own SMS-app to navigate all the custom requirements of the carriers in the world. Google aimed to standardise the client and include all these carrier-specific customizations, but RCS was about to fragment this space even further, as every vendor was expected to integrate his own client.Google then stepped in in 2015 by acquiring Jibe, a main supplier of RCS servers and the developer of a vendor-agnostic RCS-client. At this point only ONE carrier still considered to buy a own server.Google continues maintaining the existing servers and also offers to host RCS as a service for carriers. Overall goal was to defragment both the server and the client area, as this was the only way to scale.It&#x27;s time for others to step in and balance the playing field again, Apple is the best candidate for that. reply tick_tock_tick 3 hours agorootparentprev> I think that point would be stronger if anyone else was open.Nah gov doesn&#x27;t give a shit they just see the incapable outcome and the rest of Apple&#x27;s behavior. reply chimeracoder 3 hours agorootparentprev> Google used to run an open messaging service but shut it down as part of their failed attempt to compete with Facebook, and their current professed love of open RCS hasn’t extended to allowing anyone else to use their implementation.It&#x27;s funny to read this criticism, when comments in another thread are criticizing Google for running an RCS implementation as a service for carriers.RCS is an open standard, and Google does let others use it. However, other carriers didn&#x27;t adopt it themselves, so Google set up a service that carriers can use and is running it themselves to ensure compatibility. There is no API for Android apps to use, yes, and that is a problem they should fix, but it&#x27;s not exactly a self-serving decision, especially because it hampers Google&#x27;s own products as well. The reason for the lack of the app API is likely because RCS hasn&#x27;t been widely adopted enough to warrant it. reply rickdeckard 2 hours agorootparentFully agree.Android also has APIs to register another RCS client to the OS.What&#x27;s missing are open APIs for apps to control Google&#x27;s RCS-client. Indeed this would be convenient, but considering the potential for misuse there, Google would probably need a separate certification process for each app, which is quite a scale for something that didn&#x27;t scale yet...A own RCS-client still requires accreditation to ensure interoperability with the RCS-service. API-access to Google&#x27;s client would either require accreditation of the app using the client, or would need to be limited so dramatically that it&#x27;s probably of no use... reply kaba0 4 hours agorootparentprev> but the presence of a single Android user in an iMessage group chat can break the experience for everyoneIt is still such a laughable issue from the POV of any other country.. SMS is there for text-only, it’s a legacy tech that didn’t ever get popular in different places due to it having shit support for non-ascii letters (writing a single ü would almost halve the remaining chars I can write), and not having unlimited SMS sends, so internet-based messaging spread like wide-fire. iMessage is the latter, the normal SMS is not. But there are also Telegram, Whatsapp, Facebook, a million other solutions.It’s a made-up issue. reply hn_throwaway_99 3 hours agorootparent> It’s a made-up issue.My biggest pet peeve is when people have an issue that doesn&#x27;t affect them so they need to declare it as \"fake\". Just because you don&#x27;t feel the problem doesn&#x27;t mean \"it&#x27;s a made up issue\".The following are simply facts:1. In the US, among iPhone users, iMessage is by far the dominant messaging service.2. Among certain socioeconomic groups in the US, iPhone is by far the dominant mobile phone. I have been in several friend groups where there was at most 1 other Android user.3. In group chats, not only does the limited functionality for Android users make it harder to converse, but the presence of a single Android user can break the experience for everyone (I&#x27;ve had messages randomly not show up, abysmal video quality, etc.)So while I would absolutely love it if other people would switch to Telegram or WhatsApp or whatever, you try telling a group of 10 people \"Hey, can you all switch the messaging app you are familiar with and use all the time so I don&#x27;t feel left out?\" If you think that&#x27;s viable you just don&#x27;t understand human nature.The other option is for Apple to simply make an Android version of iMessage (like all the other messaging apps you mentioned), but they don&#x27;t seem too keen on that. reply bigfudge 2 hours agorootparentThe sad thing for me is that even though almost all my contacts have iPhones, the lowest common denominator effect means everyone ends up using WhatsApp to allow everyone to join.

The shaming campaigns are just a way to play the moral high ground in their effort to replace an actual messaging standard with their own proprietary service.SMS is certainly long overdue to be replaced, but I don&#x27;t want it replaced with a Google service.

Google acquired Jibe in 2015 in order to get their RCS server and client architecture (Jibe was a leader in shaping the RCS-Standard).Everyone can make his own app, it&#x27;s just that he would need to develop a whole RCS-client for it to interact with (Google&#x27;s or carriers&#x27;) RCS-Servers as well. So what is missing is Google offering their RCS-client with open API&#x27;s for other apps (than Google Messages) to use.To be fair, maintaining interoperability of those apps with the underlying client would then be a huge endeavour, Google Messages itself is already updating quite frequently... reply turquoisevar 13 hours agorootparentThe problem is that Google has a de facto monopoly on RCS.The carriers (full members of GSMA) came up with RCS as a replacement for SMS&#x2F;MMS at a network level and then didn&#x27;t have the appetite to implement it.Instead, they either A) adopted Google’s Messages as is, B) adopted Google’s Messages in white label form, slapping their logo on it, or C) made “their own thing” running on Google’s Jibe servers.With very few exceptions, it all goes through Google.

A much-needed player, and the only one that&#x27;s relevant (other than maybe WeChat and WhatsApp)-> With very few exceptions, it all goes through Google.Yeah, because the mobile end-device for RCS is currently always an Android device. If there would be support from Apple, an RCS-server of Apple could handle the communication to Apple-Devices.The idea of every carrier owning his own RCS-server was anyway already dead before the first client was released. The number of carriers never increased after the initial rollout of the major working-group members, simply because there is no way to charge for the service and monetization of such a small userbase with other services was not sustainable.It&#x27;s worth to put this into time-context here: When work on RCS (or \"RCS-e\") was initiated, WhatsApp was already well-established and leading the European market. reply dwaite 9 hours agorootparent> Monopoly is the wrong term here, the root-cause of this situation is that Google is now maintaining the largest OS-implementation of RCS by far, only followed by Samsung, and then some carriers who also use RCS for other platforms (web-apps, STB,...).Clarification - many of the carriers are using Google-hosted RCS servers as well.

It works really well and in case someone sends you a promotional SMS despite opting out, you can report them to your SIM provider (or carrier) and they are legally required to take an action.But as soon as RCS is enabled, you will magically start receiving a lot of spam messages with rich text and link previews.

Apple is fixing one issue (bad media quality) and taking away a disingenuous Google talking point. Perhaps this is also an argument to legislators that they don’t need to open iMessage.They’re never going to go out of their way to make it preferable in any way. reply eitally 10 hours agorootparentMedia quality would be a start, at least. The only other thing I&#x27;d love for them to \"fix\" is the inability to add non-iPhone users to existing group chats.

So, for instance, they could take all the RCS messages in the US, cluster them, and sell the cluster to, say, meta. Then, meta could use it for ad targeting of third party ads, but they wouldn&#x27;t be able to resell the raw data unless they first de-anonymized it.I could be wrong though. The privacy policy is very long and incredibly vague. Maybe they don&#x27;t share the contents of your private communications with their \"trusted partners\" or internal advertising division yet.The only way this sort of crap will get better is if the US passes a right to privacy constitutional amendment.

Unlimited talk & text plans were relatively common as well.In the EU for instance, the reverse was true. Particularly, unlimited data was cheap and affordable, where as SMS was quite costly (even more than in the US in some cases) so data heavy apps were easier to adopt. Hence, WhatsApp, Telegram etc. gaining so much popularity. iMessage was introduced much later to the rich messaging market than these apps in those countries (because mobile messaging apps were cheap to adopt in markets where mobile data is cheap).There is much more competition in those countries with cheap mobile data in the rich messaging services space.

The cartel was so focused on trying to save their existing money printing machine they took their eye off the ball and refused to disrupt themselves.The cable television industry did the exact same thing.

The cable providers were and continue to be hamstrung by the networks who force the cable providers to buy channel packages. Cable never had the leverage to, say, tell Disney that they only want to offer ESPN but not the 10 other Disney branded networks being offered. It was often all or nothing. reply filmgirlcw 12 hours agorootparentAnd carriage fees are not at all related to the cable companies refusal to adopt or accept OTT solutions. They could have still offered the same shit they offered coax but you know, over a web browser, without requiring you be on a home network from an ISP also your cable producer (Comcast), or on whatever device you want (Comcast, Charter) all to save the stupid extra box fees that they lost anyway.People didn’t quit cable because of price. They did it because of price to perceived value. As has been shown with the current state of streaming services, it isn’t actually cheaper to cut the cord. But what you do get is a lot more flexibility.Imagine if Comcast had offered its own YouTube TV style service in 2012 (something Intel tried to do in late 2013 before it was summarily canceled — I almost took a job on that team and dodged a bullet), rather than hoping against hope that cord cutting wouldn’t take off? You’d probably have a bunch of Comcast subscribers to this day who were satisfied that they could watch all their TV live and on demand whenever they wanted. reply ShadowBanThis01 10 hours agorootparent\"It isn’t actually cheaper to cut the cord\"No idea what kind of poor purchasing decisions would lead to that. You can&#x27;t get any form of cable package for less than $150 a month last time I checked. I don&#x27;t pay anywhere near that for Internet + a couple of streaming services.Oh, and the $30 a year or whatever for a VPN. reply filmgirlcw 12 hours agorootparentprevThat was true until the cable companies themselves bought networks. Comcast owning NBC Universal, the various cable associations with the artists formerly known as Time Warner, the various local station and sports station roll ups for the various providers, all make them entwined.And the networks were already offering online access to their content via TV Everywhere. They didn’t want to do the geolocation thing, that was all requirements of the cable companies (the issues with the network broadcasters like ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are much more complex).In fact, you could (and I would) argue that it was the cable companies insistence on maintaining their defacto monopolies on who could get what service where (because there was never consumer choice in who your cable provider is, unless you count satellite, which I do not) that pushed the networks hands into creating their own competing OTT services based on the content they owned. Because as people cut the cord, the networks weren’t going to watch their businesses completely go up in flames. Now, should they have done that sooner and more aggressively (HBO did it best and earliest with HBO Now as a companion to HBO Go — a move that earned them the ire of the cable industry, the same industry who often refused to let HBO Go subscribers who paid the cable companies directly for HBO, do things like access the service on an Xbox b.c they didn’t like the idea of people not paying a $5 a month fee for an extra box), yes. 1000%But let’s not pretend like the cable companies were without leverage. If they’d acted decisively and disrupted themselves early enough, they were the ones with the direct relationship with the customer, not the networks. They were the ones who could have created their own bundles of OTT content. But no, they refused until it was too late and got to see the whole industry bleed itself and for live content to essentially die. reply geodel 14 hours agorootparentprevExactly right. A lot of people have tendency to simplistically choose heroes and villains. SO Disney is hero, cable TV bringing disney to home via their Coax cable is villain. Top artists are heroes, but ticket booking service which ultimately are reason for enormous payout to these artists are villains gouging fans. reply filmgirlcw 12 hours agorootparentThe networks and the cable companies are both complicit with their demise. No one is arguing otherwise. I mentioned cable companies specially because they have the same legal monopoly that telephone companies had even post AT&T breakup in terms of location-based authority (it took widespread nationwide wireless for that to change in the U.S., which was like the early 2000s in terms of not having to get a regional wireless plan that could roam on a friendly network spectrum) and because like wireless carriers, cable companies have refused to acknowledge they are just a dumb pipe offering data and that they can’t continue to print money off of things that cost them nothing anymore. Oh, and because in the US, ISPs and cable companies are overwhelmingly the same companies.The networks ruined their own businesses too — even if some were smarter than others (HBO being the smartest and also why it was the most valuable asset of the AT&T acquisition and the Discovery acquisition) — but I chose to focus on the cable companies b&#x2F;c they are dumb pipes the same way wireless carriers are and they refused to disrupt themselves. reply Apocryphon 14 hours agorootparentprevI get your point but how is Ticketmaster not a parasitic price-gouger? reply jasode 13 hours agorootparent>I get your point but how is Ticketmaster not a parasitic price-gouger?Ticketmaster isn&#x27;t the true price-gouger. It&#x27;s actually the artist + promotor + venue that collectively set the high prices. Ticketmaster is just the administrative computer system to implement the high prices that the artist&#x2F;promoter&#x2F;venue want to charge.For example, top artists can negotiate to get 105% of ticket&#x27;s face value from the concert promoter. Indeed, people have speculated that Taylor Swift had so much leverage in negotiating the terms of the Eras tour that she got 110% of the ticket&#x27;s face price.[1]If Taylor gets 110% of the ticket money, how does that leave anything left for the promoter and the venue?!? With those artists&#x27; financial demands, you now have a math problem: where to get the extra +5% or +10% and also pay the promoter+venue without taking a loss? By charging extra fees.It&#x27;s a very clever bit of financial sleight-of-hand. The artist&#x2F;promoter&#x2F;venue can all charge more money but hide the blame by embedding it in Ticketmaster&#x27;s \"convenience fees\", \"service fees\", \"order processing fees\", etc, etc. In this way, Ticketmaster is perceived as the parasite.Your question where Ticketmaster is already assumed to be the \"bad guy\" means Ticketmaster&#x27;s deliberate manipulation of public perception is working exactly as designed.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;J5Eg3 reply sbuk 13 hours agorootparentTicketmaster merged with LiveMaster, a promoter and venue owner&#x2F;operator.

Taylor Swift&#x27;s promoter for Eras Tour was AEG, not Live Nation. And in Dallas, she performed at AT&T Stadium which is a venue owned by City of Arlington, not Live Nation. Ticketmaster was only the agent selling tickets for that Dallas show and it still had all the extra TM service fees padding out the price. In that case, Taylor Swift + AEG + AT&T Stadium got their slices of the pie by using Ticketmaster fees as the \"bad guy\".Live Nation acquiring Ticketmaster in 2010 doesn&#x27;t fundamentally change what Ticketmaster is designed to do: take the public relations blame for artists, etc charging the higher prices. reply carlosjobim 10 hours agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t have any global monopoly. reply jjoonathan 14 hours agorootparentprevThe artist is their customer, not you.

And that doesn&#x27;t even begin to cover the issues on inter-carrier messaging...The situation was only resolved after Google acquired Jibe Mobile (the biggest player in developing RCS server&#x2F;client applications for carriers) and basically created a single RCS-client&#x2F;server implementation using their Android Messages app and a Google-owned server.But when you were working on RCS back in 2012, you may remember that at that time, RCS didn&#x27;t even support store&forward (!!).So if the receiving device was not available when a message was delivered (because it had no network or client wasn&#x27;t running on a device, which happened alot especially on iOS because the client was in a constant fight with the OS), the message wasn&#x27;t queued anywhere.Apart from the obvious issue of missing messages, it caused the even worse UX-impact that the entire conversation looked different on sender&#x2F;receiver.--Ah yes, and: RCS was originally designed with per-message billing in mind (of course). At the time it was launched it was finally clear to the carriers that those times are over, but the whole architecture had quite a chunk of billing architecture in it as well... reply lxgr 14 hours agorootparent> The situation was only resolved after Google acquired Jibe Mobile (the biggest player in developing RCS server&#x2F;client applications for carriers) and basically created a single RCS-client&#x2F;server implementation using their Android Messages app and a Google-owned server.Thank you for highlighting this. This important piece of information often gets lost in the \"green bubble\" discussion.Google has significant incentives for pushing RCS for more than one reason. reply rickdeckard 13 hours agorootparentThe situation was resolved by Google taking effort to unify the Android landscape and maintain a single client for that OS, instead of carriers (like Orange Group) developing one client, Samsung, LG, Sony, Huawei, ZTE each developing other clientsGoogle doesn&#x27;t own the RCS-specification, the spec is still defined and maintained by GSMA, with Google just having one of the seats at the table (along with carriers and device manufacturers).Apple is also a member of GSMA, them adopting RCS means that they just take another seat at the table of the RCS working group.--> Google has significant incentives for pushing RCS for more than one reason.I don&#x27;t know if you mean to imply some hidden Agenda. The incentive is to standardize \"rich communication\" across mobile platforms. \"Green bubble\" is one manifestation of the bigger issue that 27 years after the creation of SMS there is still no other universal method for me to send a text to your phone number today.The main reason for that is, that several players still hope to own this communication channel to the user with their proprietary app, become the \"Western WeChat\" and sell access to the users.RCS could be an universal non-proprietary method, open to be adopted by Apple, Facebook, WhatsApp and whoever wants to build a Message ecosystem. It has the potential to end this hassle and allow me to send a text to your number and reach you regardless of your OS and application of preference. reply filmgirlcw 12 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. I hate that we pretend Google is somehow altruistic with their support of RCS. They have many, many incentives and pretending otherwise is naive and obtuse. reply rickdeckard 11 hours agorootparent> They have many, many incentives and pretending otherwise is naive and obtuse.Okay. The main incentive is to create a competitive method for messaging which allows rich communication with everyone, regardless of platform or ecosystem just via their phone number.Name five more. reply giantrobot 2 hours agorootparentRunning a messaging gateway means Google gets all that sweet metadata at the very least and message content in the many cases where E2EE isn&#x27;t enabled.

    "originBody": "I spent three years designing a coat hanger why um fair question because I couldn't fit a coat rck in my bedroom and it really annoyed me was it worth 3 years of work yeah definitely I just want to pop in real quick and say that I just launched a Kickstarter campaign for my coat hanger today so if you're feeling impatient you can just go straight to the kickstarter page and it will explain everything that you need to know I want to hang clothes on the wall but I don't like how far out it comes from the wall so I was thinking of like what if you could have a coat hanger that you can fold and you can have stuff closer to the wall so I just made this prototype so you fold it and then there's a little magnet and then you just hang it like that it seems like such a simple brief make a coat hanger that folds the simple designs are deceivingly complex and after 3 years of work here it is we call it the coat hinger and it's a completely new way of storing clothes so if you have a shallow closet or any other space where you want to hang clothes but you can't fit a normal coat hanger this one's for you so to use it you just put on a clothing item and then you fold it and you hang it how is this not already a thing like as soon as I had the idea I was like somebody must have already thought about this and there are foldable coat hangers that fold to like fit in a suitcase but none of them are meant to be hung folded with clothes on them and none of them save space in this way what version is this oh it's version4 this isn't even all of them oh here's the first one so the code hinger kind of has to do two things it has to hinge and then it also has to make sure that the clothes stay in place so this one has magnets the issue with this one is that it can't hold clothes thicker than a t-shirt this one's made out of snap bracelet so it holds itself in a close position and it also has a little bit of a gap so it can hold garments of different thicknesses the issue with this one is that it's very violent so we spent a long time making different wood versions of the coat hinger the thing about wood is that it's so hard to manufacture at SC SC like the tolerances are really critical to make sure that you have enough friction for it to be able to hold clothes in place and on top of that if you drop them they would break so we transition to wire this is one of the first factory samples that we got and the design is actually really simple it's just two wire parts and then a metal plate it was really hard to ensure consistent friction between the two metal components and also that it would squeak a lot so the final version is three injection molded Parts this is over molded onto the wire and then it just Clips in to this plastic clip and that means that we have two injection molded plastic parts that interface with each other which makes us in full control of all the friction and everything and it's just it's just great you know now that I see it I'm like yeah of course this is the way it should look but it required all of this to get here I just can't believe I get to spend 3 years designing a coat hanger I know that doesn't sound like everybody's definition of fun but to me that is like my absolute dream life but running a product business is not easy the only reason I'm able to do it is because of your support and even with your support like I'm losing money every month running the yet store but I really believe in our products and I'm so proud of the team and the work that we're doing and I think that the coat hinger is amazing it's a completely unique solution to an everyday problem which is like the ethos of everything that I want to do so if you want to support the project you can go on the kickstarter page or if you know somebody who could use the coat hinger maybe you want us to send them a link that would mean so much to me I got this I'm proud of myself for trying coat hangers that fold is a good idea and I appreciate you so much okay bye",

It has become easy and affordable to design products, the process is now almost fully commodified with all those OEM and production services. The only thing that now stands between your idea and financial success is your ability to reach the target market, i.e. marketing.Also, such a slick KickStarter campaign typically costs $10k plus ad spend if you buy it from an agency. Roughly 25% of the final price will be marketing and ads.

Make them. Want to make coat hangers? Make them. Want to make a book stand? Make it.Or, you could just, you know, buy them.My beef with people who say, like you do that 3D printers are cheap or you can buy an arduino&#x2F;pi&#x2F;whatever, is simple.People consistently fail to value their time, and the startup cost.The startup cost because your thinking works on the assumption that people know how to use, e.g. a 3D printer out of the box. The reality is that most people don&#x27;t. And as such, they will expend a great deal of time with Mr Google and various internet forums trying to figure it out. They will then proceed to flush money down the pan on materials during their learning.Second people seem to value their time at zero. If you value your time at zero, then sure, its cheaper to make it yourself. But if you value your time realistically, its cheaper to either (a) buy it or (b) pay a domain-expert to make it for you. reply fxtentacle 4 minutes agorootparentSadly, 3D printers are still cheaper.I once needed to make a few customized gears out of food safe plastic. I asked several online services for quotes and I called several on-location shops in northern Germany. The quotes I got were all around $1800 per unique gear shape. Since I needed 4 different shapes (i.e. $7k for outsourcing), it was much cheaper to buy a 3D printer, watch some tutorials and spend two working days just to make them myself.Plus I honestly don&#x27;t know why Shapeways (for example) will always quote you multiple weeks in lead time. What do they do in those 2 weeks after the print finished but before they send the parcel? reply throwaway71271 8 minutes agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t value my time at zero, I just think making something is more valuable than my time. reply Kodix 6 minutes agorootparentprevYou are correct about the utility calculation, of course.It&#x27;s just that many people can afford to have hobbies, and hobbies do not have to earn money or be a good investment in order to be worth doing. reply Zanni 5 hours agoprevI came across the Kickstarter [1] for this as a Facebook ad and passed over it for all the reasons folks are citing below.

She definitely worked on other projects in that time.Ultimately the volume taken up by the clothes is the same, you either have a shallow but wide closet, or deep but narrow.

I&#x27;ve started to almost (more jokingly than seriously) believe that the less novel something appears the more it actually is. The real mark for a good work seems to be \"wow, how did you spend so much time on that? It&#x27;s so fucking obvious\" combined with \"why has no one else done this?\" But it is also easy to post hoc attribute something to being \"well that&#x27;s just x and y, so not really novel.\" But far too many things can be trivialized that way.I wanted to say this because I think especially in engineering circles we have this wild novelty paradox. Where we can understand how our work, despite all outward appearances, is exceptionally nuanced and has minor details that are critical but when we judge others&#x27; works we don&#x27;t consider such details. I think this is because most details are baked in when you learn of the new thing. But we got a good litmus test: is anyone else making&#x2F;producing&#x2F;doing this \"super simple blatantly obvious\" thing. If no? It&#x27;s probably deceptively complex. (It&#x27;s also why you should laugh at anyone who starts a sentence with \"It&#x27;s so simple, you just...\") reply somedude895 35 minutes agorootparentI used to embarassingly think that design was merely a matter of aesthetics until I read The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman, which opened my eyes to how much thought goes into seemingly simple things. Really changed the way I look at human-designed objects.My favorite anecdote due to its simplicity and ubiquity that I never thought about previously was the anecdote about the idea of making top surfaces slanted in public spaces to keep people from placing empty drinking cups and such on top of them. So damn simple and inconspicuous, but so effective and now I see it everywhere! reply SOLAR_FIELDS 3 hours agorootparentprevShe labels her prototypes in the video on the Kickstarter page and the one that either ended up being the final design or very close to it was prototype number 134. So it did take her quite a long time to arrive at the solution. reply ehnto 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s never a linear path either, I am sure she branched down paths not used in the final design and spent many hours solving small parts of solutions she never actually used. reply ImageXav 4 hours agoparentprevThis is an extremely useful design. I never thought I&#x27;d get excited about something like this but I recently moved to an old house with chimney flues running through every room, resulting in shallow alcoves that are of differing sizes.A fitted wardrobe would be pricey (~$4000), barely fit depthwise and half of the space would just be covering the flue if we wanted it wall to wall.On the other hand I can just buy 3&#x2F;4 of these for each wall and still come out ahead. The grooves in the rods are well thought out and mean that I can saw them to size myself, as can anyone.The only drawback I can think of is having clothes up directly against a wall. This could obstruct airflow and be an incentive for mould to grow.Might be time for my first ever pledge. reply killerpopiller 3 hours agorootparentI thought about it as well but if the rod is attached to a plank on the wall the clothes are 1cm away from the wall allowing for some air circulation.Btw, there is an alternative solution, a hanger where the hook can spin, so one can hang clothes diagonally, nearly flat. Hers looks nicer on the wall though. reply ehnto 1 hour agorootparentI find coathangers comically cumbersome, if they could spin willy nilly I just might give up and store my shirts in draw. I already just fold and stack most everything else, the only thing I bother hanging is button down shirts. reply dan-robertson 54 minutes agorootparentBasically any coat hanger not made of wire or a single plastic part has a rotatable hook. There’s usually enough friction that they won’t normally spin. reply bcraven 43 minutes agorootparentprevThe other drawback is creasing all of your clothes. reply irjustin 5 hours agoparentprev> But my first thought was that it will almost certainly be cloned and sold en masse pretty quickly, so I hope she gets enough revenue from it to pay for her time.The reason why this isn&#x27;t a thing yet is a few reasons - from my humble perspective:First, it&#x27;s actually a 2 part system.You need the coat hanger but you also need the coat rack, more specifically - the dowel, to be really close to the wall.So you would want to sell this as a kit. She doesn&#x27;t really talk about it in the video - it feels like an odd afterthought. The kickstarter has it but only at the $135 starting level.Secondly, it&#x27;s not a \"one size fits all solution\". I can&#x27;t use this with really bulky jackets. I think it&#x27;s a cool, front door, guest entryway piece.Last, it&#x27;s pricy - really pricy. You&#x27;re asking me to pay ~$15-20&#x2F;hanger. If you have this specific problem... still hard pressed - definitely expendable income level. But because it takes up more width, it can hold fewer items not a general place to store clothes (hence i think guest front door would be a cool-piece&#x2F;talking-point). reply pengaru 4 hours agorootparent> You need the coat hanger but you also need the coat rack, more specifically - the dowel, to be really close to the wall.Curtain rods are a solved problem with widespread availability across the quality spectrum, this is a total non-issue. reply irjustin 2 hours agorootparentehhhhhhh i&#x27;m not so sure about it.I think the details matter. Curtain rods are typically 1-4\" from the wall. This product looks like it works best”it will almost certainly be cloned and sold en masse pretty quickly”Wouldn’t it be worth taking out a design patent on a product like this? It might not stop people making similar designs, but it would give you protection against outright clones. reply gibolt 2 hours agorootparentI think you underestimate Aliexpress, Wish, Temu, ...The sheer quantity of goods being shipped in, one-by-one on a daily basis make it impossible to block in any effective manner. reply repeekad 6 hours agoparentprevHopefully she already started the patent process, otherwise it’s either 1) an expired patent 2) an existing patent 3) she actually invented it but won’t profit at all from it reply Juicyy 6 hours agorootparentPatenting this for her portfolio maybe, I can design and print a folding plastic hanger in 1 piece in less than 24 hours. A mold not far behind if i reached out to a shop... you raise an interesting point I think gets asked in nearly every YC interview. How do you build your moat or stop any big players from competing with a very similar product. I think she actually misidentified the problem she was trying to solve. In her case, imo, her \"secret sauce\" would be the space saving clothes rack&#x2F;furniture AND matching hangers. There is no solution with her hanger in normal clothes racks. so her hanger product actually serves no purpose. reply wlesieutre 5 hours agorootparentMost of the options on Kickstarter include both the hangers and low profile rod&#x2F;brackets (and a shelf on the fancy one). The tier without a rod included says:> While using your own rod isn&#x27;t recommended, we got a lot of requests for it so here you go! Please read our FAQ before buying so you&#x27;re aware of the pros and cons. Some basic DIY knowhow required.I think she knows the hanger is only useful as part of a system. reply jtuente 5 hours agorootparentprevHer Kickstarter does have tiers with brackets&#x2F;shelves, so yeah, that&#x27;s already there too. reply retrochameleon 5 hours agorootparentprevShit. You do have a really good point. There&#x27;s not many examples of hanger bars mounted so close to a wall or in a tiny closet already. Most people who might use this would have to be building or installing one for this custom purpose.I also wondered if it wouldn&#x27;t make your shirts more wrinkly or have the potential to leave creases. I don&#x27;t think anyone cares to invest in a space-saving solution like this if it means all their shirts will be wrinkled or creased. Unless space is the primary constraint, like a tiny apartment, tiny house, or custom van build. reply edlucas 5 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of examples of shallow closets in older homes&#x2F;apartments that were once workers&#x27; quarters. I lived in a triple-decker in Somerville, MA that had a bedroom closet that was only deep enough for hooks on the back wall to hold the limited clothing of the occupants. The only way I could use a rod for hangers was to remove the closet door.Simone&#x27;s hangers would have been perfect. replyipsum2 3 hours agoprevI used to like her videos, but found out that she takes other people&#x27;s work and passes it off as her own. This video is a good example. Anyone reading the title and watching the video, it appears that she&#x27;s done all of the work iterating on the prototypes. No one else is mentioned in doing any of the work.Only in the comments does she post \"If you have any technical questions, my co-inventor @stumcconnel will be here helping answer stuff!\"So not only did she not invent this by herself, she&#x27;s referring to someone else for technical questions.

Also there&#x27;s rods with angled notches to turn hangers 45 degrees. reply jstimpfle 11 minutes agoparentMy thought as well. The disadvantage though is that you need to move a \"pack\" of hung clothes and turn them around (or pull them out) to find the one you&#x27;re looking for. In the folded arrangement, you can probably find what you&#x27;re looking for at a glance, from a distance. reply hobofan 2 hours agoparentprevOr also just coat hangers that have a rotating top (most with a wooden body and a metal top have that). There were also some really viable solutions displayed on the Google image search that were just glossed over.The way it&#x27;s presented in the video it does look really nice, but having to pair it with one of their rods is kind of limiting. reply maxglute 2 hours agorootparentYeah, my main gripe is the design seems like a subpar hanger.If she&#x27;s going ditch purity of wood or steel wire, with bits of plastic, go all the way and have nice little molded end for shoulders. Or coat the wire in velvet which is life changing upgrade in terms of anti slip (she has muh silicon stoppers). Also would be nice if she extended horizontal neck of hanger out with a stop to keep fabric away from the back&#x2F;wall so the crease is not rubbing against a surface. Just little ideas which I feel like she must have considered with 100+ iterations and the result is functionally subpar. Granted aestehtically simply and pleasing to some. reply pfannkuchen 3 hours agoparentprevMuch goofier looking though. reply maxglute 3 hours agorootparentThere are nice looking high end options and plastic aliexpress versions. And everything in between. Bonus, the design works for pants or textiles since it does everything normal hanger does. These \"space saving\" solutions have been thought through for decades. I like the aesthetic of her design, but it kind of fails at being a good versatile hanger. Seems like it&#x27;s good for storing a few articles of frequently used clothing where one doesn&#x27;t need to consider long term creasing, basically a slight upgrade from a few nails on the wall. reply avar 6 hours agoprevIsn&#x27;t the point of a coat hanger to hang your clothes uncrumpled? If you&#x27;re compromising on that aspect, wouldn&#x27;t wall hooks fit most use cases?For places where space is at a premium a normal coat hanger on a telescopic rod would be a viable alternative in many cases, i.e. have the clothes rotate almost 90°, and mostly overlap.You can also stack the coat hangers vertically, e.g. with cheap plastic brackets like these: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a.aliexpress.com&#x2F;_Ew6YWEtThere&#x27;s surely good niche use cases for these, but looking at this advertisment I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d want to go for this particular solution.The sales pitch would be more convincing if it was contrasted to other space saving clothes hanging techniques in existing use, rather than pointing out that the inventor was unable to find prior art for her particular solution. reply jacoblambda 6 hours agoparentThere is a pretty major difference between crumpled and folded. A soft&#x2F;wide radius fold isn&#x27;t going to leave wrinkles or a major crease but it may still be noticeable.A sharp&#x2F;small radius fold will leave a crease but will be significantly less noticeable on most clothes than wrinkles.And either way the crease would be along a stress point where wearing the clothes would smooth the crease out quickly. reply avar 5 hours agorootparentSpeaking of crumples, it&#x27;s interesting that the final design makes the apparent compromise of not folding the clothes down the middle, but slightly off to the side.But in the discarded invention pile we can see an older design that folds down the exact middle (it has springs on the bottom). reply chis 6 hours agoparentprevStacking vertically does kinda get there but there are some clear downsides. You can&#x27;t access clothes in the back without taking off the whole stack. And it&#x27;s visually a lot worse: you&#x27;re just looking at like 5 shirts flattened on the wall instead of a neat line of flat sleeves. reply avar 5 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t have to take the whole stock off the hook or rack, you just grab one of the hangers and move the item to the side.Or (in the case of that cheap AliExpress plastic dongle) pull the bottom part up and away from the wall, and detach the clothes item with your other hand.And yeah, maybe it&#x27;s less pretty or whatever, but that&#x27;s my point unthread: since this isn&#x27;t contrasted with existing viable alternatives the sales pitch is rather incoherent. reply georgesimon 42 minutes agoprevI was hoping this would be the coat hanger I have in my ideas bin for the last three years.

All she does is say \"there are no folding coat hangers on the market\".The simplest thing would be to just get a hanger with a rotating hook and hang it at a ~45 degree angle and I don&#x27;t see how her solution is better, especially considering she wants to have over $6 per hanger. reply sirk390 1 hour agoparentI you hang them at 45 degree the depth will be reducted by sqrt(2). (about 0.7 x hanger length), and you will lose space on each side. And the more you increase the angle, the more you will lose space on the sides. With this technique, you will reduce the depth to 0.5 x hanger length and not lose space on the side. reply sltkr 26 minutes agorootparentYes, but folding the clothes doubles their thickness, so you can fit fewer hingers on a single rod than traditional hangers.Also the coat hinger system uses fixed distance between the hingers (due to the slots in the rod) which seems like it would be less efficient: thick sweaters and thin T-shirts take up the same width.It&#x27;s actually not clear if the hinger system works all that well if you need to hang a lot of thick clothes; the rack looks pretty crowded in the available pictures.I guess you would have to try this in practice to see which system works better. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it boils down to \"the 45 degree angle is better, but the coat hinger looks neater\". reply trabant00 36 minutes agorootparentprevWith this solution you lose the most space on the side because of the notched rod. The notches have to be wide enough for a the thickest stuff, but then a shirt will take as much space as thick coat.If your goal is to save as much depth as possible the solution is obviously front to back direction rods, as opposed to side to side. There&#x27;s plenty of options available from retractable ones to wall mounted ones that don&#x27;t require a closet and so on. reply sltkr 11 minutes agorootparent> The notches have to be wide enough for a the thickest stuff, but then a shirt will take as much space as thick coat.It&#x27;s probably easier to take out a hinger and let a thick coat take up two spaces (or more). Assuming you have only few coats, that&#x27;s more efficient than increasing the spacing uniformly.It does seem like you lose some flexibility due to the slots, though.It also seems possible to put many more slots in the rod. There is no functional reason why slots and hingers need to match 1 on 1.> If your goal is to save as much depth as possible the solution is obviously front to back direction rods, as opposed to side to side.Somehow it feels like it would be harder to store the same amount of clothes on front-to-back rods.

My apartment has a bunch of bookshelves with hanging bars in them (?) definitely not big enough for normal hangers unless you turn them sideways and lose a bunch of space.On this design though, my biggest criticism would be that it requires the hanger to be leaning against the wall when folded, to not fall at an angle. While that&#x27;s fine for the co-designed rack she has, it makes them a lot less useful on their own or in other randomly wall-to-rack spaced closets (even says so in the kickstarter).The simple solution is to move the hook to be centered over the folded hanger, so it&#x27;s balanced when folded.

Thousands of subscribers depend on LWN for the best news from the Linux and free software communities. If you enjoy this article, please consider subscribing to LWN. Thank you for visiting LWN.net! By Jonathan Corbet November 16, 2023 LPC The addition of realtime support to Linux is a long story; it first shows up in LWN in 2004. For much of that time, it has seemed like only a little more work was needed to get across the finish line; thus we ran headlines like the realtime preemption endgame — in 2009. At the 2023 Linux Plumbers Conference, Thomas Gleixner informed the group that, now, the end truly is near. There is really only one big problem left to be solved before all of that work can land in the mainline. The point of realtime preemption is to ensure that the highest-priority process will always be able to run with a minimum (and predictable) delay. To that end, it makes the kernel preemptible in as many situations as possible, with the exceptions being tightly limited in scope. The basic mechanics of how that works have been established for a long time, but there have been a lot of details to resolve along the way. The realtime preemption work has resulted in the rewriting of much of the core kernel over the years, with benefits that extend far beyond the realtime use case. Gleixner started by noting that, while the realtime preemption project has been underway for nearly 20 years, it is actually closer to 25 years for him — he started working on realtime support for Linux in 1999. Once it's done, he said, there will be \"a big party\". Is that point at hand? The answer, he said, is \"yes — kind of\". There is one last holdout to be dealt with: printk(). Whenever code in the kernel needs to send something to the system consoles and logs, it calls printk() or one of the numerous functions built on top of it. One might not think that printing a message would be a challenging task, but it is. A call to printk() can come from any context, including in non-maskable-interrupt handlers or other printk() calls. The information being printed may be crucial, especially in the case of a system crash, so printk() calls have to work regardless of the context. As a result, there are a lot of concurrency and locking issues, and lots of driver-related complications. printk(), Gleixner said, is fully synchronous in current kernels; a call will not return until the message has been sent to all of the configured destinations. That is \"stupid\"; much of what is printed is simply noise, especially during the boot process, and there is no point to waiting for it all to go out. Beyond being pointless, that waiting introduces latency, which runs counter to the goals of the realtime work, so the realtime developers have long since moved printk() output into separate threads, making it asynchronous. That code is a bunch of hacks rather than a real solution, though. A better job must be done to make this work useful for the rest of the kernel. The printk() problem has been worked on seriously since 2018, resulting in about 300 patches that have either gone upstream or are waiting in linux-next; this work has been covered here at times. There are, he said, three final patch sets currently in the works to finish the job. A few tricky details are still being worked on. One of those is the handover mechanism; if the kernel has an emergency message to put out (it's crashing, for example), it may need to grab control of a console that is currently printing a lower-priority message. Doing that safely from any context is not an easy thing to do. Another ongoing task is marking console drivers that are not safe to use in some contexts; if, for example, outputting a message during a non-maskable interrupt requires doing video-mode setting, it's just not going to work. Gleixner finished the prepared part of his talk by saying that, even though it's getting close, nobody should ask him when the work will be done. printk() is unpredictable, and he is no longer willing to even try. Even so, he expressed hopes that the rest of the realtime preemption code would be in mainline before the 20th anniversary comes late in 2024. An audience member asked whether there had been any interesting changes in the printk() code over the last year; Gleixner answered that there have been no fundamental conceptual changes. John Ogness, who has done much of the printk() work, said that the handover code has been reduced somewhat, but that some work remains; there are 76 console drivers in the kernel that need to be fixed, and it may take a while until they are all done. The handover code has been changed to allow drivers to be updated one at a time rather than requiring that this work all be done at once. (See this article for more discussion on the recent printk() work). Masami Hiramatsu asked which kernel messages need to be printed synchronously; Gleixner answered that almost everything should be made asynchronous. Beyond reducing latency associated with printk() calls, asynchronous output allows the creation of a separate kernel thread for each console, letting the faster consoles go at full speed rather than waiting for the slowest one. He also said that the code has been changed to ensure that important messages are fully copied into the message buffer before the first line is output, just in case a faulty console driver brings the whole system down in flames. Further safety is obtained by writing to the known-safe consoles first. If, for example, there is a persistent-memory store available, messages are put there before being sent to physical devices, once again preserving the output even if a faulty driver kills the system. As the session closed, Clark Williams asked whether, once the printk() patches go upstream, Gleixner would try to push the rest of the realtime code (which wasn't discussed in this session) in the same merge window. The answer was a qualified \"yes\"; he might try if all of the code is staged in linux-next and seems ready to go.

I remember when I was managing a large Linux-based gateway, and I configured serial console (over IPMI), and later I added some iptables LOG rules, and it turned out that just a few matching packets per second would DoS it because it wasn't processing any packets while waiting for each log message to go out through ttyS1...

Had the effect of (a) rebooting the machine if it was ever accidentally turned off, and (b) halting the machine whenever it ran out of paper.

The real realtime preemption end game Posted Nov 16, 2023 22:53 UTC (Thu) by mjg59 (subscriber, #23239) [Link] In general? No. You have no guarantees about the behaviour of the firmware over reboot, and it's legitimate for it to just wipe the entire contents of RAM before booting anything else. But there are specific cases where this can be guaranteed - check the various pstore backends for examples. The real realtime preemption end game Posted Nov 17, 2023 0:47 UTC (Fri) by itsmycpu (subscriber, #139639) [Link] Maybe something like this could preserve a range of memory? However I wouldn't know if that could be interesting in this context... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot#Warm \"The Linux family of operating systems supports an alternative to warm boot; the Linux kernel has optional support for kexec, a system call which transfers execution to a new kernel and skips hardware or firmware reset. The entire process occurs independently of the system firmware. The kernel being executed does not have to be a Linux kernel.[citation needed]\" The real realtime preemption end game Posted Nov 17, 2023 5:33 UTC (Fri) by mjg59 (subscriber, #23239) [Link] kexec certainly provides a mechanism for preserving memory ranges over kernel switches, but it's not really what most people would describe as reboot Copyright © 2023, Eklektix, Inc.

The microkernel has upper bounds on everything it does. There are only a few tens of thousands of lines of microkernel code. All the microkernel does is allocate memory, dispatch the CPU, and pass messages between processes. Everything else, including drivers and loggers, is in user space and can be preempted by higher priority threads.The QNX kernel doesn&#x27;t do anything with strings. No parsing, no formatting, no messages.Linux suffers from being too bloated for real time. Millions of lines of kernel, all of which have to be made preemptable. It&#x27;s the wrong architecture for real time. So it took two decades to try to fix this. reply vacuity 14 hours agoparentFor a modern example, there&#x27;s seL4. I believe it does no dynamic memory allocation. It&#x27;s also formally verified for various properties. (Arguably?) its biggest contribution to kernel design is the pervasive usage of capabilities to securely but flexibly export control to userspace. reply _kb 9 hours agorootparentAnd unfortunately had its funding dumped because it wasn’t shiny AI. reply adastra22 13 hours agorootparentprevCapabilities are important, but I don’t think that was introduced by seL4. Mach (which underlies macOS) has the same capability-based system. reply vacuity 12 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t say seL4 introduced capabilities. However, to my knowledge, seL4 was the first kernel to show that pervasive usage of capabilities is both feasible and beneficial. reply adastra22 9 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s quite a history of capabilities-based research OS&#x27;s that culminated in, but did not start with L4 (of which seL4 is a later variant). reply vacuity 8 hours agorootparentYes, but I believe seL4 took it to the max. I may be wrong on that count, but I think seL4 is unique in that it leverages capabilities for pretty much everything except the scheduler. (There was work in that area, but it&#x27;s incomplete.) reply adastra22 8 hours agorootparentL4 was developed in the 90&#x27;s. Operating Systems like Amoeba, which were fundamentally capability-based to a degree that even exceeds L4, were a hot research topic in the 80&#x27;s.L4&#x27;s contribution was speed. It was assumed that microkernels, and especially capability-based microkernels were fundamentally slower than monolithic kernels. This is why Linux (1991) is monolithic. Yet L4 (1994) was the fastest operating system in existence at the time, despite being a microkernel and capability based. It&#x27;s too bad those dates aren&#x27;t reversed, or we might have had a fast, capability-based, microkernel Linux :( reply mananaysiempre 6 hours agorootparentprevIIRC the KeyKOS&#x2F;EROS&#x2F;CapROS tradition used capabilities for everything including the scheduler. Of course, pervasive persistence makes those systems somewhat esoteric (barring fresh builds, they never shut down or boot up, only go to sleep and wake up in new bodies; compare Smalltalk, etc.). reply adastra22 3 hours agorootparentAmoeba was my favorite, as it was a homogeneous, decentralized operating system. Different CPU architectures spread across different data centers, and it was all homogenized together into a single system image. You had a shell prompt where you typed commands and the OS could decide to spawn your process on your local device, in the server room rack, or in some connected datacenter in Amsterdam, it didn&#x27;t make a difference. From the perspective of you, your program, or the shell, it&#x27;s just a giant many-core machine with weird memory and peripheral access latencies that the OS manages.Oh, and anytime as needed the OS could serialize out your process, pipe it across the network to another machine, and resume. Useful for load balancing, or relocating a program to be near the data it is accessing. Unless your program pays special attention to the clock, it wouldn&#x27;t notice.I still think about Amoeba from time to time, and imagine what could have been if we had gone down that route instead. reply vacuity 2 hours agorootparentWouldn&#x27;t there be issues following from distributed systems and CAP? Admittedly, I know nothing about Amoeba.E.g. You spawn a process on another computer and then the connection drops. reply vacuity 6 hours agorootparentprevGuess I&#x27;m too ignorant. I need to read up on these. I did know about the persistence feature. I think it&#x27;s not terrible but also not great, and systems should be designed for being shut down and apps being closed. reply monocasa 9 hours agorootparentprevThe other L4s before it showed that caps are useful and can be implemented efficiently. reply vacuity 8 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;2517349.2522720\" We took a substantially different approach with seL4; its model for managing kernel memory is seL4’s main contribution to OS design. Motivated by the desire to reason about resource usage and isolation, we subject all kernel memory to authority conveyed by capabili- ties (except for the ﬁxed amount used by the kernel to boot up, including its strictly bounded stack). \"I guess I should&#x27;ve said seL4 took capabilities to the extreme. replygigatexal 13 hours agoparentprevQNX is used in vehicle infotainment systems no?

I find that we&#x27;re going in this direction in many areas, games just got there much faster.Pretty much everywhere there is some undercurrent of \"use this ultra-small generic interface for everything and life will be easier\". With games and ECS, microkernels and IPC-for-everything, with frontend frameworks and components that only communicate between themselves via props and events, with event sourcing and CQRS backends, Actors in Erlang, with microservices only communicating via the network to enforce encapsulation... Perhaps even Haskell&#x27;s functional-core-imperative-shell could count as that?I feel like OOP _tried_ to get to this point, with dependency injection and interface segregation, but didn&#x27;t quite get there due to bad ergonomics, verbosity and because it was still too easy to break the rules.

Especially since there&#x27;s now lots of cheap, relatively low power, and high clock rate ARM and x86 chips to choose from. With the clock rates so high, perfect real-time becomes less important as you would often have many cycles to spare for misses.I understand it&#x27;s less elegant, efficient, etc. But sometimes commodity wins over correctness. reply tuetuopay 17 hours agoparentThe thing is, stuff that require hard realtime cannot satisfy with \"many cycles to spare for misses\". And CPU cycles is not the whole story. A badly made task could lock down the kernel not doing anything useful. The point of hard realtime is \"nothing cannot prevent this critical task from running\".For automotive and aerospace, you really want the control systems to be able to run no matter what. reply tyingq 17 hours agorootparentYes, there are parts of the space that can&#x27;t be displaced with this.I&#x27;m unclear on why you put \"many cycles to spare for misses\" in quotes, as if it&#x27;s unimportant. If a linux&#x2F;arm (or x86) solution is displacing a much lower speed \"real real time\" solution, that&#x27;s the situation...the extra cycles mean you can tolerate some misses while still being as granular as what you&#x27;re replacing. Not for every use case, but for many. reply tuetuopay 17 hours agorootparentYou won&#x27;t be saved from two tasks deadlocking with cycles&#x2F;second. this is what hard realtime systems are about. However, I do agree that not all systems have a real hard realtime requirements. But those usually can handle a non-rt kernel.As for the quotes, it was a direct citation, not a way to dismiss what you said. reply tremon 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think realtime anything has much to do with mutex deadlocks, those are pretty much orthogonal concepts. In fact, I would make a stronger claim: if your \"realtime\" system can deadlock, it&#x27;s either not really realtime or it has a design flaw and should be sent back to the drawing board. It&#x27;s not like you can say \"oh, we have a realtime kernel now, so deadlocks are the kernel&#x27;s problem\".Actual realtime systems are about workload scheduling that takes into account processing deadlines. Hard realtime systems can make guarantees about processing latencies, and can preemptively kill or skip tasks if the result would arrive too late. But this is not something that the Linux kernel can provide, because it is a system property rather than about just the kernel: you can&#x27;t provide any hard guarantees if you have no time bounds for your data processing workload. So any discussion about -rt in the context of the Linux kernel will always be about soft realtime only. reply tuetuopay 16 hours agorootparentmuch agreed. I used deadlocks as an extreme example that&#x27;s easy to reason about and straight to the point of \"something independent of cpu cycles\". something more realistic would be IO operations taking more time than expected. you would not want this to be blocking execution for hard rt tasks.In the case of the kernel, it is indeed too large to be considered hard realtime. Best case we can make it into a firmer realtime than it currently is. But I would place it nowhere near avionics flight calculators (like fly-by-wire systems). reply hamilyon2 9 hours agorootparentprevI had an introductory course on OS and learned about hard real-time systems. I had impression hard real-time is about memory, deadlocks, livelocks, starvation, and so on. And in general about how to design system that moves forward even in presence of serious bugs and unplanned-for circumstances. reply syntheweave 8 hours agorootparentBugs related to concurrency - which is where you get race conditions and deadlocks - tend to pop up wherever there&#x27;s an implied sequence of dependencies to complete the computation, and the sequence is determined dynamically by an algorithm.For example, if I have a video game where there&#x27;s collision against the walls, I can understand this as potentially colliding against \"multiple things simultaneously\", since I&#x27;m likely to describe the scene as a composite of bounding boxes, polygons, etc.But to get an answer for what to do in response when I contact a wall, I have to come up with an algorithm that tests all the relevant shapes or volumes.The concurrency bug that appears when doing this in a naive way is that I test one, give an answer to that, then modify the answer when testing the others. That can lead to losing information and \"popping through\" a wall. And the direction in which I pop through depends on which one is tested first.The conventional gamedev solution to that is to define down the solution set so that it no longer matters which order I test the walls in: with axis aligned boxes, I can say \"move only the X axis first, then move only the Y axis\". Now there is a fixed order, and a built-in bias to favor one or the other axis. But this is enough for the gameplay of your average platforming game.The generalization on that is to describe it as a constraint optimization problem: there are some number of potential solutions, and they can be ranked relative to the \"unimpeded movement\" heuristic, which is usually desirable when clipping around walls. That solution set is then filtered down through the collision tests, and the top ranked one becomes the answer for that timestep.Problems of this nature come up with resource allocation, scheduling, etc. Some kind of coordinating mechanism is needed, and OS kernels tend to shoulder a lot of the burden for this.It&#x27;s different from real-time in that real-time is a specification of what kind of performance constraint you are solving for, vs allowing any kind of performance outcome that returns acceptable concurrent answers. reply nine_k 14 hours agorootparentprevHow much more expensive and power-hungry an ARM core would be, if it displaces a lower-specced core?I bet there are hard-realtime (commercial) OSes running on ARM, and the ability to use a lower-specced (cheaper, simpler, consuming less power) core may be seen as an advantage enough to pay for the OS license. reply lmm 12 hours agorootparent> How much more expensive and power-hungry an ARM core would be, if it displaces a lower-specced core?The power issue is real, but it might well be the same price or cheaper - a standard ARM that gets stamped out by the million can cost less than a \"simpler\" microcontroller with a smaller production run. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentprevIt is sort of funny that language has changed to the point where quotes are assumed to be dismissive or sarcastic.Maybe they used the quotes because they were quoting you, haha. reply tuetuopay 17 hours agorootparentit&#x27;s precisely why I quoted the text, to quote :) reply archgoon 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure they were just putting it in quotes because it was the expression you used, and they thus were referencing it. reply zmgsabst 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s an example of a system that requires hard real time and couldn’t cope with soft real time on a 3GHz system having 1000 cycle misses costing 0.3us? reply LeifCarrotson 15 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;ve successfully used a Delta Tau real-time Linux motion controller to run a 24 kHz laser galvo system. It&#x27;s ostensibly good for 25 microsecond loop rates, and pretty intolerant of jitter (you could delay a measurement by a full loop period if you&#x27;re early). And the processor is a fixed frequency Arm industrial deal that only runs at 1.2 GHz.Perhaps even that&#x27;s not an example of such a system, 0.3 microseconds is close to the allowable real-time budget, and QC would probably not scrap a $20k part if you were off by that much once.But in practice, every time I&#x27;ve heard \"soft real time\" suggested, the failure mode is not a sub-microsecond miss but a 100 millisecond plus deadlock, where a hardware watchdog would be needed to drop the whole system offline and probably crash the tool (hopefully fusing at the tool instead of destroying spindle bearings, axis ball screws, or motors and gearboxes) and scrap the part. reply zmgsabst 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the detailed reply!I’m trying to understand where the roadblock on a rPi + small FPGA hybrid board for $50 fails at the task… and it sounds like the OS&#x2F;firmware doesn’t suffice. (Or a SoC, like a Zynq.)Eg, if we could guarantee that the 1.5GHz core won’t “be off” by more than 1us on responding and the FPGA can manage IO directly to buffer out (some of) the jitter, then the cost of many hobby systems with “(still not quite) hard” real time systems would come down to reasonable. reply rmu09 1 hour agorootparentYou can get pretty far nowadays with preempt rt and an FPGA. Maybe you even can get near 1µs max jitter. One problem with the older RPis was unpredictable (to me) behaviour of the hardware, i.e. \"randomly\" changing SPI clocks, and limited bandwidth.Hobby systems like a small CNC mill or lathe usually don&#x27;t need anything near 1µs (or better) max jitter. LinuxCNC (derived from NIST&#x27;s Enhanced Machine Controller, name changed due to legal threats) runs fine on preempt-rt with control loops around 1kHz, with some systems you can also run a \"fast\" thread with say 20kHz and more to generate stepper motor signals, but that job is best left for the FPGA or an additional µC IMHO. reply krylon 10 hours agorootparentprevI suspect a fair amount of hard real time applications are not running on 3GHz CPUs. A 100MHz CPU (or lower) without an MMU or FPU is probably more representative.But it&#x27;s not really so much about being fast, it&#x27;s about being able to guarantee that your system can respond to an event within a given amount of time every time.

Think avionics, medical devices, automotive, military applications.If you really need realtime, then you really need it and \"close enough\" doesn&#x27;t really exist.This is just my perception as an outsider though. reply abe_m 17 hours agorootparentHaving worked on a number of \"real time\" machine control applications:1) There is always a possibility that something fails to run by its due date. Planes crash sometimes. Cars won&#x27;t start some times. Factory machinery makes scrap parts sometimes. In a great many applications, missing a real time deadline results in degraded quality, not end of life, or regional catastrophy. The care that must be taken to lower the probability of failure needs to be in proportion to the consequence of the failure. Airplanes have redundant systems to reduce (but not eliminate) possibility of failure, while cars and trucks generally don&#x27;t.2) Even in properly working real time systems, there is a tolerance window on execution time. As machines change modes of operation, the amount of calculation effort to complete a cycle changes. If the machine is in a warm up phase, it may be doing minimal calculations, and the scan cycle is fast. Later it may be doing a quality control function that needs to do calculations on inputs from numerous sensors, and the scan cycle slows down. So long as the scan cycle doesn&#x27;t exceed the limit for the process, the variation doesn&#x27;t cause problems. reply mlsu 17 hours agorootparentThat is true, but generally not acceptable to a regulating body for these critical applications. You would need to design and implement a validation test to prove timing in your system.Much easier to just use an RTOS and save the expensive testing. reply vlovich123 13 hours agorootparentBut you still need to implement the validation test to prove that the RTOS has these requirements… reply blt 13 hours agorootparentprevHow is your point 2) a response to any of the earlier points? Hard realtime systems don&#x27;t care about variation, only the worst case. If your code does a single multiply-add most of the time but calls `log` every now and then, hard realtime requirement is perfectly satisfied if the bound on the worst-case runtime of `log` is small enough. reply abe_m 12 hours agorootparentI suppose it isn&#x27;t, but I bristle when I see someone tossing around statements like \"close enough doesn&#x27;t really exist\". In my experience when statements like that start up, there are people involved that don&#x27;t understand variation is a part of every real process. My point is that if you&#x27;re going to get into safety critical systems, there is always going to be some amount of variation, and there is always a \"close enough\", as there is never an \"exact\" in real systems. reply jancsika 7 hours agorootparentThe point is to care about the worst case within that variation.Most software cares about the average case, or, in the case of the Windows 10&#x2F;11 start menu animation, the average across all supported machines apparently going 20 years into the future. reply dripton 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can divide realtime applications into safety-critical and non-safety-critical ones. For safety-critical apps, you&#x27;re totally right. For non-critical apps, if it&#x27;s late and therefore buggy once in a while, that sucks but nobody dies.Examples of the latter include audio and video playback and video games. Nobody wants pauses or glitches, but if you get one once in a while, nobody dies. So people deliver these on non-RT operating systems for cost reasons. reply lll-o-lll 12 hours agorootparent> You can divide realtime applications into safety-critical and non-safety-critical ones.No. This is a common misconception. The distinction between a hard realtime system and a soft realtime system is simply whether missing a timing deadline leads to a) failure of the system or b) degradation of the system (but the system continues to operate). Safety is not part of it.Interacting with the real physical world often imposes “hard realtime” constraints (think signal processing). Whether this has safety implications simply depends on the application. reply jancsika 12 hours agorootparentprevYour division puts audio performance applications in a grey area.On the one hand they aren&#x27;t safety critical.On the other, I can imagine someone getting chewed out or even fired for a pause or a glitch in a professional performance.Probably the same with live commercial video compositing. reply eschneider 10 hours agorootparentAudio is definitely hard realtime.

These are still realtime requirements, different from what your typical browser does (for example): who cares if a webpage is rendered in 100ms or 2s?

There&#x27;s \"people will die if it&#x27;s late\". \"The line will have to stop for a day if it&#x27;s late\". \"If it&#x27;s late, it&#x27;ll wreck the part currently being made\". Etc.Even hard-realtime systems have a failure rate, in practice if not in theory - even a formally verified system might encounter a hardware bug. So it&#x27;s always a case of tradeoffs between failure rate and other factors (like cost). If commodity operating systems can push their failure rate down a few orders of magnitude, that moves the needle, at least for some applications. reply wongarsu 17 hours agorootparentprevThere is some amount of realtime in factory control where infrequent misses will just increase your reject rate in QA. reply ajross 16 hours agorootparentprev> Think avionics, medical devices, automotive, military applications.FWIW by-device&#x2F;by-transistor-count, the bulk of \"hard realtime systems\" with millisecond-scale latency requirements are just audio.The sexy stuff are all real applications too.

The argument is that RT Linux would be a killer solution for that.But you can do all these proposed \"soft\" use cases with embedded Linux today. It&#x27;s not like low-latency software video or audio playback is not possible, or wasn&#x27;t possible twenty years ago. You only run into problems on busy systems where non-preemptible I&#x2F;O could regularly get in the way. That&#x27;s seldom a concern in embedded environments.I think there are compelling reasons for making the kernel fully-preemptible, giving people more control over scheduling, and so forth. But these reasons have relatively little to do with wanting Linux to supersede minimalistic realtime OSes or bare-metal code. It&#x27;s just good hygiene that will result in an OS that, even in non-RT applications, behaves better under load. reply eisbaw 17 hours agoprevGreat to hear. However even if Linux the kernel is real-time, likely the hardware won&#x27;t be due to caches and internal magic CPU trickery.Big complex hardware is a no-no for true real-time.That&#x27;s why AbsInt and WCET tools mainly has simple CPU architectures. 8051 will truly live forever.btw, Zephyr RTOS. reply wholesomepotato 17 hours agoparentFeatures of modern CPUs don&#x27;t really prevent them from real time usage, afaik. As long as something is bounded and can be reasoned about it can be used to build a real time system. You can always assume no cache hits and alikes, maximum load etc and as long as you can put a bound on the time it will take, you&#x27;re good to go. reply bloak 17 hours agorootparentSo the things that might prevent you are:1. Suppliers have not given you sufficient information for you to be able to prove an upper bound on the time taken. (That must happen a lot.)2. The system is so complicated that you are not totally confident of the correctness of your proof of the upper bound.3. The only upper bound that can prove with reasonable confidence is so amazingly bad that you&#x27;d be better off with cheaper, simpler hardware.4. There really isn&#x27;t a worst case. There might, for example, be a situation equivalent to \"roll the dice until you don&#x27;t get snake eyes\". In networking, for example, sometimes after a collision both parties try again after a random delay so the situation is resolved eventually with probability one but there&#x27;s no actual upper bound. A complex CPU and memory system might have something like that? Perhaps you&#x27;d be happy with \"the probability of this operation taking more than 2000 clock cycles is less than 10^-13\" but perhaps not. reply SAI_Peregrinus 17 hours agorootparentprevExactly. \"Real-time\" is a misnomer, it should be called \"bounded-time\". As long as the bound is deterministic, known in advance, and guaranteed, it&#x27;s \"real-time\". For it to be useful it also must be under some application-specific duration.The bounds are usually in CPU cycles, so a faster CPU can sometimes be used even if it takes more cycles. CPUs capable of running Linux usually have higher latency (in cycles) than microcontrollers, but as long as that can be kept under the (wall clock) duration limits with bounded-time it&#x27;s fine. There will still be cases where the worst-case latency to fetch from DRAM in an RT-Linux system will be higher than a slower MCU fetching from internal SRAM, so RT-Linux won&#x27;t take over all these systems. reply dooglius 15 hours agorootparentprevSystem management mode is one example of a feature on modern CPUs that prevents real-time usage https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.linuxfoundation.org&#x2F;realtime&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;howt... reply synergy20 17 hours agorootparentprevmlock your memory, test with cache miss and cache invalidation scenarios will help, using no heap for memory allocation, but it&#x27;s a bit hard reply jeffreygoesto 13 hours agorootparentRight.

There exists an entire real time spirit there, where you don&#x27;t really use the CPU to do any bit banging but everything is on time as seen from the outside. You have timers that receive the quadrature encoders inputs, and they just send interrupt when they wrap, the GPIO system can be plugged to the DMA, so you can stream the memory to the output pins without involving the CPU (again, interrupts at mid-buffer and empty buffer). You can stream to a DAC, stream from a ADC to memory with the DMA. A lot of that stuff bypasses the caches to get a predictable latency. reply stefan_ 17 hours agorootparentNice idea but big chip design strikes again: on the latest Raspberry Pi, GPIO pins are handled by the separate IO chip connected over PCI Express. So now all your GPIO stuff needs to traverse a shared serial bus (that is also doing bulk stuff like say raw camera images).And already on many bigger MCUs, GPIOs are just separate blocks on a shared internal bus like AHB&#x2F;APB that connects together all the chip IP, causing unpredictable latencies. reply SubjectToChange 15 hours agoparentprevBig complex hardware is a no-no for true real-time.There are advanced real time cores like the Arm Coretex-R82.

Logging is, almost by definition, not the \"core\" of your application, so failure to log properly should not prevent the core of the program from working. Killing the whole program because logging server is clearly throwing the baby out with the bathwater.What people probably mean is \"logging is important, let&#x27;s avoid losing log messages if possible\", which is what \"best\" in \"best effort\" stands for. For example it&#x27;s often a good idea to have a local log queue, to avoid data loss in case of a temporary log server downtime. reply fnordpiglet 16 hours agorootparentIt depends.Some systems the logs are journaled records for the business or are discoverable artifacts for compliance. In highly secure environments logs are not only durable but measures are taken to fingerprint them and their ordering (like ratchet hashing) to ensure integrity is invariant.I would note that using disk based logging is generally harmful in these situations IMO. Network based logging is less likely to cause blocking at some OS level or other sorts of jitter that’s harder to mask. Typically I develop logging as an in memory thing that offloads to a remote service over the network. The durability of the memory store can be an issue in highly sensitive workloads, and you’ll want to do synchronous disk IO for that case to ensure durability and consistent time budgets, but for almost all application disk less logging is preferable. reply shawnz 16 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re not waiting for the remote log server to write the messages to its disk before proceeding, then it seems like that&#x27;s not guaranteed to me?

The first write is a quorum. Also from a systems POV reads are not a feature of logs. reply lmm 6 hours agorootparentprevCAP is irrelevant, consistency does not matter for logs. reply fnordpiglet 14 hours agorootparentprevThe difference is that network IO can be more easily masked by the operating system than block device IO. When you offload your logging to another thread the story isn’t over because your disk logging can interfere at a system level. Network IO isn’t as noisy. If durability is important you might still need to wait for an ACK before freeing the buffer for the message which might lead to more overall memory use, all the operations play nicely in a preemptable scheduling system.Also, the failure modes of systems are very tied to durable storage devices attached to the system and very rarely to network devices. By reducing the number of things that need a disk (ideally to zero) you can remove disks from the system and its availability story. Once you get to fully disk less systems the system failure modes are actually almost nothing. But even with disks attached reducing the times you interact with the disk (especially for chatty things like logs!) reduces the likelihood the entire system fails due to a disk issue. reply ReactiveJelly 15 hours agorootparentprevIf it&#x27;s a journaled record for the business then I think I&#x27;d write it to SQLite or something with good transactions and not mix it in the debug logs reply fnordpiglet 14 hours agorootparentThere are more logs than debug logs, and using SQLite as the encoding store for your logs doesn’t make it not logging. reply cduzz 17 hours agorootparentprevPeople use logging (appropriately or inappropriately; not my bucket of monkeys) for a variety of things including audit and billing records, which are likely a good case for a guaranteed delivery API.People often don&#x27;t think precisely about what they say or want, and also often don&#x27;t think through corner cases such as \"what if XYZ breaks or gets slow?\"And don&#x27;t get me started on \"log\" messages that are 300mb events.

In other words it should be a hard real-time system that is formally verified top to bottom, down to the last transistor. Does anyone actually do that? Verify the program and the hardware to prove that it will never run out of memory for logs and such?Continuing this thought, logs are probably generated endlessly, so either whoever wants them has to also guarantee that that they are processedand disposed of right after being logged... or there is a finite ammount of log messages that can be stored (arbitrary number like 10 000) but the user (of logs) has to guarantee that they will take the \"mail\" out of the box sooner than it overfills (at some predictable, deterministic rate). So really that means even if OUR system is mathematically perfect, we&#x27;re just making the downtime someone elses problem - namely, the consumer of the infinite logs.That, or we guarantee that the final resources of our self-contained, verified system will last longer than the finite shelf life of the system as a whole (like maybe 5 years for another arbitrary number) reply morelisp 14 hours agorootparentPACELC says you get blocking or unavailability or inconsistency. reply supriyo-biswas 17 hours agorootparentprevThe better way to do this is to write the logs to a file or an in-memory ring buffer and have a separate thread&#x2F;process push logs from the file&#x2F;ring-buffer to the logging service, allowing for retries if the logging service is down or slow (for moderately short values of down&#x2F;slow).Promtail[1] can do this if you&#x27;re using Loki for logging.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;loki&#x2F;latest&#x2F;send-data&#x2F;promtail&#x2F; reply insanitybit 16 hours agorootparentBut that&#x27;s still not guaranteed delivery.

And I&#x27;m not sure that even that would give you the worst case as far as the cache is concerned. Of course I don&#x27;t know how these implementations work, but it seems plausible that code that directly uses memory could run faster than code that encounters a cache miss beforehand (or contention, if you&#x27;re using multiple cores). Moreover there&#x27;s also the instruction cache, and I&#x27;m not sure if you can disable caching for that in a meaningful way?For soft real time, I don&#x27;t see a problem.

The vast majority of the time the ring buffer handles temporary disruptions (eg slow disk I&#x2F;O to write messages to disk) but in the rare failure scenarios you simply overwrite events in the buffer and increment an atomic overwritten event counter. Events do not get silently dropped but you prioritize forward progress at the cost of data loss in rare scenarios.Microkernels and pushing everything to userspace just moves the tradeoffs around. If your driver is in userspace and blocks writing a log message because the log daemon is blocked or the I&#x2F;O device it is writing the log to is overloaded it does the same thing. Your realtime thread won&#x27;t get what it needs from the driver within your time limit.It all comes down to CAP theorem stuff. If you always want the kernel (or any other software) to be able to make forward progress within specific time limits then you must be willing to tolerate some data loss in failure scenarios. How much and how often it happens depends on specific design factors, memory usage, etc. reply EdSchouten 18 hours agoparentprevAnother option is simply to print less, but expose more events in the form of counters.Unfortunately, within a kernel that’s as big as Linux, that would leave you with many, many, many counters.

And this works, and avoids the kinds of problems detailed in the linked article. But it&#x27;s fiddly to configure, expensive in an RTOS environment (you need RAM for that thread stack and the buffer), depends on having a I&#x2F;O backend that is itself async&#x2F;low-latency, and has the mentioned misfeature where when things blow up, it&#x27;s usually failed to flush the information you need out of its buffer.[1] Somewhat but not completely orthogonal with printk. Both can be implemented in terms of each others, mostly. Sometimes. reply vlovich123 15 hours agorootparentWhat if the lower priority thread is starved and the buffer is full? Do you start dropping messages? Or overwrite the oldest ones and skip messages? reply ajross 15 hours agorootparentIt drops messages. That&#x27;s almost always the desired behavior: you never want your logging system to be doing work when the system is productively tasked with other things.I know there was some level of argument about whether it&#x27;s best to overwrite older content (ring-buffer-style, probably keeps the most important stuff) or drop messages at input time (faster, probably fewer messages dropped overall). But logging isn&#x27;t my area of expertise and I forget the details.But again, the general point being that this is a complicated problem with tradeoffs, where most developers up the stack tend to think of it as a fixed facility that shouldn&#x27;t ever fail or require developer bandwidth.

I&#x27;ve been using it for years without issue.On a BeagleBone Black, it typically gives jitter on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. I would consider it \"hard\" real-time (as do they). I&#x27;m able to schedule tasks periodically on the scale of tens of microseconds, and they never get missed.It differs from this in that Real-Time Linux attempts to make Linux itself preemptive, whereas Xenomai is essentially its own kernel, running Linux as a task on top. It provides an ABI which allows you to run your own tasks alongside or at higher prio than Linux. This sidesteps the `printk()` issue, for instance, since Xenomai doesn&#x27;t care. It will gladly context switch out of printk in order to run your tasks.The downside is that you can&#x27;t make normal syscalls while inside of the Xenomai context. Well... you can, but obviously this invalidates the realtime model. For example, calling `printf()` or `malloc()` inside of a xenomai task is not preemptable. The Xenomai ABI does its best to replicate everything you may need as far as syscalls, which works great as long as you&#x27;re happy doing your own heap allocations.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xenomai.org&#x2F; reply 0xDEF 17 hours agoprevWhat do embedded real-time Linux people use for bootloader, init system, utilities, and C standard library implementation?

Unless you want to burn gas (co2) or coal (co2 and radioactive emissions that cause more cancers in the us then nuclear has world wide)Renewables outside hydro cannot, and will never, be able to provide a a stable base load for the grid, battery storage isn’t there and has all sorts of issues, pumped storage requires even more rare conditions then hydro, as does geothermal, so we are left with nuclear as the only real clean and reasonable path forward that we would have done decades ago if not for oil and gas doing everything to prevent it.So what is YOUR proposal to provide a stable base load? reply hef19898 12 minutes agorootparentBase load, for starters, is an overblown problem, multiple days with close to 100% renewables showed us that. Now that this is out of the way:Massive build out of renewables, mainly solar and wind. Build the grid for that as well. Use gas peaker plants, if needed. Keep nuclear plants running as long as safely possible. Invest in a green hydrogen network for storage. Make industrial demand more flexible. Reinterate, rinse and repeat.I work from memory here, based on what I learned during my masters and a couple of stints in energy hungry industries a couple of yeaes ago. Besides gas peaker plants and green hydrogen, all of that is already happening in Europe.Especially solar and wind build out is progressing massively across the world, even without a concentrated effort behind it.Regarding industrial demand flexibility, that is also happening for a decade now (I personally know it does in the chemical industry, paper industry and graphite industry, surprising how much flexibility companies can squeeze out of production tech that was historically seen as being not flexible at all when there is loads of money to be made). Domestic demand is different, convenience beats saving most of the time, also households don&#x27;t have professional energy management (hint: there isba massive, hard, start-up idea here: provide automated consumption control of electricity for households beyond smart thermostats ansball the other \"smart\" home crap).Nuclear is a dead end in the developed world: too expensive (Hinkley C was already more expensive than wind like 7 years ago), takes too long install (just google year per kWh for the last NPPs installed) and has additional, unsolved, long term issues (waste storage only being one of those). Heck, even investors are quiting NPPs across the Western world. Nuclear has a future so: existing plants need be run as long as safely possible (the main reason German plants were shit down, they reached the end of their service live), for countries with nuclear arsenals, for the production of medical radionucleoids, for research... New ones are a waste of time, energy and money right now so.And yet again, you said why something doesn&#x27;t work, because just building dozens of plants and go fully nuclear is not feasible or realistic for the developed world.For developing countries it is different, and they should build nuclear plants instead of coal ones, but then those have a lot of catching up to do. They could also go fully renewable right away so, they should have an \"easier\" (nothing is easy about any of this) life doing so without a century of legacy structures and systems to worry about (grids, industry, domestic use...). reply andyjohnson0 43 minutes agorootparentprev> There is none except hydro and nuclear for base load.I&#x27;m not the person you&#x27;re replying to, and I mostly agree with your points, but I think its necessary to point out that nuclear and hydro have long lead times to build the infrastructure.

The best time to build nuclear was before Chernobyl, and since Fukushima new nuclear plants are dead basically. kawhah 23 minutes agorootparentprevMy proposal would be to use combined cycle gas turbines to peak renewables until over-installation and storage make that no longer necessary.Gas is the cleanest fossil fuel. Modern gas turbines are by far the most efficient way of generating electricity from fossil fuels. Replacing fossil fuels burnt in ICEs and for heating with electricity generated using gas will drastically reduce emissions quickly. There is plenty of gas.The strategic reasons for doing this are that gas turbines will be able to handle the extreme &#x27;duck curves&#x27; and other demand volatility we will see when both renewables and electric vehicles are ramped up hard. Those are the two levers which are currently easiest to push on - because individuals can replace vehicles and heating systems, and will do so given smallish financial incentives. And because solar, wind and storage, can be scaled easily without excessive top-down planning or insane capital needs.If nuclear is to be the solution, we have to quickly commit to it hard as a society. Compared to gas, nuclear will both make electricity more expensive and make swings and volatility in demand or in renewable supply more costly to deal with. It will on the margin discourage EV and electric heating, and discourage other renewables.Nuclear is good at &#x27;base load&#x27;, but not much else. This is fine(-ish) if we rapidly switch to almost all nuclear. It works well in a &#x27;Star Trek economy&#x27; where governments can act quickly and cheaply and impose choices by offering abundance. If this was the case, it would make sense to call a 50 year decision that nuclear with a modest amount of over-provision will replace almost all generation. (It has succeeded historically only in France, a very centralized economy for a Western democracy and where the government has abundant access to capital.)The real climate economy is not like this. If you want to see an example of rapid change in action, look at the fracking revolution in the United States. Small players who saw opportunities created a whole new set of technologies, techniques and practices. They did this because they could react to incremental incentives. They didn&#x27;t have to win everywhere at once. They could win field by field, installation by installation. We need the situation for new renewable generation and power storage to work like this.Gas isn&#x27;t a 50 year decision, more like a 20 year decision. It reduces emissions a lot in the short term but leaves the playing field wide open for further rapid and drastic reductions in the longer term.(A subsidiary concern but still a real one: if you could press a button and replace all fossil fuels with reliable and safe nuclear, you would instantly have catastrophic political breakdown in places where societal cohesion depends on money from fossil fuels. Moving from oil to gas and then ramping down gas progressively allows these places to gradually develop other incomes, and allows the rest of the world time to deal with them and political problems which they are likely to export.)_ reply svantana 36 minutes agorootparentprevThere is also geothermal, where some very interesting innovations are being made by Quaise Energy among others.Also, energy storage is emerging as an electricity grid stabilizer. The cost trend of solar+wind+storage is looking very promising when compared to nuclear. reply mplewis 32 minutes agorootparentprevI advise not building nuclear plants on a coast next time. reply lm28469 1 hour agorootparentprevIf we start taking such arbitrary metrics then literally nothing works ever reply hef19898 1 hour agorootparentprevThe pro-nuclear growd (funny how easy it is for otherwise smart people to be sold on mere talking points) has a point so: during generation a nuclear power plant doesn&#x27;t emit CO2. What people willfully (?) ignore is the simple fact that a) we don&#x27;t have enough nuclear capacity installed, and never did and b) you cannot just wish nuclear power plants into existence. The latter being the main blocking point.Just how you can jump from that to opposing renewables build outs is beyond me.

E.g. when travelling to the US I was astonished to see escalators going at night with no one around. In Germany they stop at night. Or Germany uses lots of public transport while the US doesn&#x27;t. Which reflects in the numbers, the US has much higher g&#x2F;person compared to Germany (Didn&#x27;t look into Portugal). reply debok 1 hour agorootparentI think both metrics have their value. g&#x2F;kwh gives you nice overview at how clean the energy is, and there is value in optimising that figure.The problem with measuring CO2 per person is that it is heavily influenced by the wealth level of the country&#x27;s population. Poor counties have very low CO2 emissions, but people in wealthy countries wouldn&#x27;t want to trade their living standards for those of a poor country. That would arguably be worse than climate change in the first place.So optimising for CO2 g&#x2F;kwh allows us to reduce our emissions without reducing our quality of living.

The slow uptick of EVs in Germany is partialy part of the problem, it would be the easiest way to increase storage.As a tought experiment, if all cars in Germany would be EVs, those could store 2 days of electricity usage.For flat owners solar panel usage increased a lot, but battery production is way behind, the first usable ones arrived this year, but it will take some more years to get out of BETA.

So maybe its better for local air quality, but really the emissions are quite high.The actual metric that reflects the total embodied energy, which is a much better proxy for CO2 intensivity, is Levelized Cost of Energy, and nuclear is typically one of the worst.Not only does the high cost of nuclear reflect all the embedded energy, that high cost is taking money away that could be used for other energy saving and therefore CO2 reducing activities, like better insulation, upgrading equipment, smart grid, etc.Also, lets look at the posts that are \"minused\" without explanation. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38300495 reply himinlomax 1 hour agorootparent> Here&#x27;s a harsh reality: \"zero co2\" nuclear emits massive amounts of CO2 during mining, during enrichment, creation of fuels, the massive motorcades that transport the fuels to their final power plant destination where they finally produce power without emitting CO2.

With solar power due to increase more than 7x by 2030 (now generating 8% of all power consumed), and wind by almost 3x with almost all additions being offshore (now generating 18% of all power), it&#x27;s easy to see that even we assume 50% curtailment rate, they will provide 100% renewable power easily. reply adev_ 3 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s easy to see that even we assume 50% curtailment rate,It is now 07h00 in Portugal.- Solar production is reduced to 0% because it is night time.

You can&#x27;t increase overall amounts of electricity produced this way because water in dams is finite, but you can increase max power output when needed. This costs a tiny amount compared to digging up dams themselves, displacing businesses and people on the lands to be flooded, buying up land etc. because the footprint of the hydro powerplant doesn&#x27;t change.In some countries that&#x27;s a problem because they don&#x27;t have enough water. Portugal is lucky with that. Water in dams provides seasonal storage of a sort (even if it&#x27;s never literally pumped up - just used only when necessary, on a high throughput if need be).It will also mean that at daytime and overnight when wind is strong, hydro plants will completely stop....In fact, that seems already done. Portugal has 7.6GW of hydro capacity, up from 5GW in 2008. This allows for peak hydro production to cover 1.37 of average and almost entirety of peak electricity consumption in the country. So the answer is very trivial: \"when situations like today happen, just use hydro, and don&#x27;t use hydro in other situations when either wind or solar are available\". reply wewxjfq 1 hour agoparentprev> \"Green\" Germany...Germany managed to have dirty electricity with nuclear energy, too.

The conservatives said renewables drive electricity prices up and set out to stop them, and around the time they shut down nuclear power plants, they considered it an achievement to have prevented new photovoltaic installations.* Germany had exactly one government that put their faith in renewables and that was a noble goal, considering that renewables were at the very bottom of the S-curve, which also means that one could only make babysteps towards green energy.

If you assume it is used for load following that goes from 5x-20x depending on capacity utilization.Pumping water uphill (snowy 2, coire glas, etc) is way way WAY cheaper and the geography to do that is ridiculously common.Electrolyzing water and storing hydrogen underground is way cheaper too, and can be stored for months cheaply. reply survirtual 6 hours agorootparentNuke plant -> btc mining with excess load when load is not demanded Nuke plant -> consumers when in demandPretty easy equation, much more reliable and much more scalable and not subject to the whims of the elements &#x2F; can be done anywhere and on any planet in the solar system. reply rcxdude 40 minutes agorootparentBTC mining is the exact opposite of scalable: there&#x27;s a fixed supply of BTC available to mining, so you can only pay for so many nuclear power plants with it.

The UK has a good civil service that puts out a lot of infomation on things that affect policy - from crime to consumption to energy use.My comment was intended to encourage the user asking \"at what cost\" to form a better question and pursue their own answers. reply reaperman 8 hours agorootparentprevOn one hand, solar and wind are very cheap - significantly cheaper than fossil fuels. On the other hand, you still also need either a significant amount of fossil fuel capacity or energy storage available to kick in during hours when solar and wind can&#x27;t provide as much production. So instead of building enough fossil fuel production for 110% of your peak need, you might lower that to 50% and then still also build 110% of your need in renewable energy -- so you&#x27;d be over-capitalized at a total installed capacity of fossil fuels + renewables at about 160% of peak need.So, marginal cost is lower. Total capital outlay might be higher. Portugal provides energy at an average of 9.7¢ &#x2F; kWh which presumably is high enough to pay back all the capital costs in addition to the marginal costs. Mississippi only has 1% renewables and provides electricity at 11.55¢ &#x2F; kWh.So it would appear at a very rough glance that the answer to \"At what cost?\" is...\"Negative cost\". reply amanaplanacanal 8 hours agorootparentprevWind and solar are cheap as chips.

The last 10% is really not something that will have weight. Actually I consider complaining about that bad faith. Too many countries run on pretty much majority fossils, reducing that has the largest impact and setting an example will help there. A world where we run on 90% renewables is a good one. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentFirst of all, to avoid the 2 degrees warming threshold, we need to be at net 0 emissions in like 10 years. Which absolutely requires 0% fossil fuels in electricity and heating, all year round, all over the world. 10% fossil fuels in electricity is nowhere close to good enough.Secondly, the current best for renewables is nowhere close to 90% year round.

Solar + wind will be the cheapest, and will make up the bulk of primary production. But they won’t replace coal, natural gas, oil and nukes—not in the near term, and certainly not if we’re tooling up for EVs.Portugal has gone gas. America will, too, in all likelihood. Both will be subsidised by countries without natural gas reserves who have decided to shun nuclear. reply Maxion 3 hours agoparentWhat you say is not true in most places.EV charging won&#x27;t raise overall power consumption that much, and the majority of tthe EU will stop burning coal around the 2030&#x27;s. Nuclear isn&#x27;t much on the table in Europe, especially since new wind developments produce cheaper power than nuclear plants.Solar works quite well at lower latitudes, but at higher latitudes in Europe it can work as a supplement to hydro in the summer (as there&#x27;s less water around then), but it won&#x27;t play any significant role in power production (some 10s of percentage points perhaps).Biggest challenge for the next few decades is inertia as well as base load when there&#x27;s low wind over large geographic areas. We need cheaper (and better) grid scale energy storage. A lot of people forget about the cheaper part. reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparent> EV charging won&#x27;t raise overall power consumption that muchIt does create a better use for batteries. Both for raw materials and talent. reply vegetablepotpie 7 hours agoprevThis article promotes a narrative that privatization leads to more renewables. This point lacks nuance as different energy markets that employ privatization can have wildly different ways to involve private firms and vastly different outcomes.1. The retail competition of Texas, which has the highest renewable energy production in the U.S. [1], but is also a market where consumers overpay for electricity [2].2. The regulated competition of California where municipalities have the ability to buy electricity in bulk and pass the savings onto the consumer. This ironically leads to more local government involvement in electricity procurement, and also gives private electricity generators more customers to sell to and rate payers at least two options to choose from. This leads to lower electric rates and higher renewable adoption, with some municipalities reaching over 90% renewable adoption [3].3. Then you have what I call the energy tyranny of Arizona where ratepayer dollars are directed into the pockets of shareholders through legal fictions of “fair and reasonable return” for private investor owned utilities. Private companies are granted monopolies and guaranteed profits. Any form of competition is suppressed, community Solar is essentially rejected by the utility board [4], and the state legislature repealed competition laws to prevent it from being used to compete with utilities [5].

By 2045 the government wants to have the equivalent of 10 new reactors, some of which are likely to be small modular reactors (SMRs), smaller than conventional reactors. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Energy Minister Ebba Busch said the government was planning a \"massive build out\" of new nuclear power by 2045. \"It's decisive for the green transition, for Swedish jobs and at heart for the welfare of our citizens,\" she told reporters. Countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Britain are looking at expanding nuclear power as societies transition to a fossil-fuel free future. But critics have pointed to the huge costs and the private sector's reluctance to invest without guarantees or other incentives - like Britain's deal with French nuclear developer EDF for its new Hinkley Point C plant which gave price guarantees. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Sweden's government has already offered 400 billion crowns ($37.71 billion) of loan guarantees to support new nuclear power, which it says is needed to power developments like fossil-fuel free steel production, but said it was now willing to shoulder more of the burden. \"Guarantees are very important, but that won't be enough,\" Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson said. \"For this type of infrastructure it is going to require the state to take part and share the risk.\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue The government said it had not yet decided what kind of funding model it would adopt, but stressed that the private sector was ready to invest in building new plants given the right circumstances. Energy Minister Busch said state-owned Vattenfall, Finland's Fortum and Germany's Uniper were among those who had expressed interest. Sweden voted to get rid of nuclear power in 1980, and has only six of an original 12 reactors still in production. The current right wing government wants to replace old reactors and expand the fleet to drive the electrification of industry and transport. The government has forecast that electricity demand will rise to around 300 Twh by 2045 as a result of the transition to a fossil-free society, up from around 140 Twh currently.

Thanks! reply twelvechairs 11 hours agoparentprevThing with Nuclear is its long term. It&#x27;s 10 years to plan (theres always some customisation), fund, develop and train then another 5-10 before you move to profitability. Then through the life cycle there&#x27;s constant government scrutiny and regulation before a complex decommissioning process that is pre-paid. This doesnt fit well with political election cycles.Solar and wind are winning not because they are cheaper or more balanced for the grid but because you can buy off the shelf components, install them quickly and make it to profitability sooner. There&#x27;s just a whole lot less time and risk. reply Manuel_D 10 hours agorootparentNuclear produces more electricity than wind and solar combined: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electricity_generationI do agree wind and solar are cheaper presently. But this is primarily because they&#x27;re being deployed in the context of supplementing a fossil-fuel backed grid. Provisioning more wind and solar starts becoming much dicier when you start saturating the grid during hours of peak production. In theory, negative electricity prices will prompt people to provision storage and capture the free (cheaper than free!) energy. But in practice, energy storage at grid scale is expensive and there are much better uses for batteries - chiefly in electric vehicles.Nuclear, on the other hand, is one of the few carbon-free energy sources that is non-intermittent. The only others are geographically limited: hydropower and geothermal power. reply danhor 9 hours agorootparentInterestingly enough the source for the first graph in the article shows the opposite: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;international&#x2F;data&#x2F;world&#x2F;electricity&#x2F;ele...Even more staggering is that from 2020 to 2021 solar+wind grew by ~15%. reply jes5199 8 hours agorootparentprevbattery production will keep increasing, and eventually the EV-battery market will be saturatedrecycled EV batteries could be a major source for cheap grid battery storage reply zeroonetwothree 7 hours agorootparentCurrently only 1% of vehicles are electric.

Not that cheap nor profitable in nordic climate as you&#x27;d think. reply epistasis 9 hours agorootparentWhat makes sense for Sweden may not make sense for the vast majority of energy production in the world.It makes a lot of sense for Sweden to buy nuclear, even if it is exceptionally pricy and slow to deliver, if they don&#x27;t have better options. But the fraction of the world population in that situation is not large, either, so we shouldn&#x27;t extrapolate from Sweden to too many other places. reply baix777 7 hours agorootparentprevAlso, the learning curve on wind and solar is so much faster than nuclear. reply epistasis 9 hours agorootparentprevOne other disadvantage of the long term nature of nuclear is that you lock in high prices for a very very very long time.Whereas when you report your wind farm or solar farm after 30 years you can take advantage the fall in component prices. reply parl_match 11 hours agorootparentprev> Solar and wind are winningThey will not and cannot win until we have cheap, highly dense, efficient power storage. That is, unfortunately, at least 20 years off (if we&#x27;re lucky).They will continue to be an important part of our energy ecosystem, and we should aggressively build them out, but we still need the fundamental power solution. reply epistasis 9 hours agorootparentFortunately we do have cheap, dense batteries that are being deployed on a massive scale with new solar.The idea that we are not currently, today, deploying massive amounts of batteries everywhere with today&#x27;s technology is just plain ignoranceIt is no longer 2003. By 2030 it&#x27;s likely that annual world production of battery storage will be 20-30 TWh. Today, we are getting close to 1TWh production per year.Edit: just for example, take Texas&#x27;s grid, which is one of the few places where storage is allowed to compete on its own cost merits. There are multiple GW, currently, much more in the pipeline, and prices still have a long ways to fall on battery installations (grid assets are usually measured by power, to convert to energy multiply by 4 hours:> Installed battery capacity increased from 153 MW in 2019 to 3,518 MW in 2023. Interconnection agreements have been signed for an additional 7,945 MW of battery storage through 2024, allowing batteries to play a growing role in daily power needs in the near future.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dallasfed.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;economics&#x2F;2023&#x2F;1017 reply alvah 4 hours agorootparent\"The idea that we are not currently, today, deploying massive amounts of batteries everywhere with today&#x27;s technology is just plain ignorance\"I don&#x27;t see anyone making this weirdly-specific claim. However, it&#x27;s widely acknowledged that sufficient battery storage to guarantee national grid-wide power on-demand, sufficient for a modern industrial economy, is not currently feasible, in both economic and practical terms. reply matthewdgreen 9 hours agorootparentprevThe first two Swedish nuclear plants won&#x27;t come online for at least 12 years, and the next eight aren&#x27;t scheduled to be operational until 2045. That&#x27;s 22 years in the future.Personally I think your timeline for storage is going to prove wildly conservative (we already have 5GW installed in CA, China is building capacity exponentially.) But even if you&#x27;re right: these nuclear plants are going to come online right at the moment when storage makes them economically obsolete. reply childintime 6 hours agorootparentExactly. And their construction will have pumped 25% of the CO2 in the atmosphere they were supposed to prevent during their lifetime. Nuclear is a really bad idea if construction takes that long. reply hutzlibu 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy does the storage has to be dense, if they are stationary? reply kuratkull 10 hours agorootparentDense means they have a good size to kw&#x2F;h ratio. If it&#x27;s too low, nobody will install them. Space is a premium after all. reply hutzlibu 10 hours agorootparentSpace in the cities is premium. Space in rural areas is not. I really don&#x27;t think space is the problem, mass producing maybe, but otherwise have a big powerbank in every basement and you are done. reply tuatoru 5 hours agorootparentThis is right. For grid connected storage, two things matter: 10-year total cost, and durability. At least a 30-year design life. (Well, reliability matters too: that &#x27;s implicit.)Volume and mass are just whatever they are. They don&#x27;t matter. reply pengaru 8 hours agorootparentprev> have a big powerbank in every basement and you are done.Especially in the case of flooding, Fukushima style. reply _ph_ 20 minutes agorootparentBesides that most areas aren&#x27;t in the risk of flooding, there is litte preventing you to water proof your batteries to the point that submerging them into water has no ill effects. The housing of the batteries usually is water-proof anyway. Just look at all the Teslas driving through deep water. Oil tanks for heating are a huge problem with flooding though, as they tend to leak oil into the environment. reply hutzlibu 1 hour agorootparentprevFlooding destroys alsl batteries obviously, but the slightly important difference to Fukoshima is, a saltwater batterie does not contaminate the area. replythrowbadubadu 3 hours agorootparentprevimo that&#x27;s outdated mantra repeated while we are just getting there.. but anyway: as is any nuclear 10 year planning now 20 years out then in reality, at least here in the west. reply yodsanklai 9 hours agorootparentprev> Solar and wind are winningGenuine question. What kind of solar&#x2F;wind installation could generate 2GW of power on demand (including when no wind or sun) and how much would that cost? is it even feasible with actual technology? reply epistasis 9 hours agorootparentIs that really a genuine question?2GW of batteries attached to solar installations, spread over multiple sites, is quite common in 2023. What do you mean by \"what kind\"? Its just the normal kind. reply yodsanklai 1 hour agorootparentIf there&#x27;s no sun, how long can the battery deliver? And if there&#x27;s too much sun, where&#x27;s the extra power dissipated? I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s possible to provide a service equivalent to a nuclear powerplant today, and if so, how much it costs. reply _ph_ 15 minutes agorootparentThe thing is, the question doesn&#x27;t really make sense. Yes you could design a closed system of solar production and battery storage, which delivers power 24&#x2F;7. But that is not reasonable. Solar is only one part of the electricity supply to the grid. Wind is another. Add to that water, biomass, etc. and you have multiple sources which complement each other. You would need battery storage only for those remaining amounts of electricity which cannot be served by the combination above. And this amount is easily an order of magnitude (or more) lower than a solar+storage system alone. This also heavily depends on your local climate. The closer to the equator you get, the more a solar storage only needs to supply energy over the night. There a solar+storage only grid would be the no brainer. reply yodsanklai 3 minutes agorootparentThe question makes sense. When people claim that wind + solar wins over nuclear. They compare apple and orange. Nobody is able to explain what wind&#x2F;solar (+ other renewable) installation is doable right night in Sweden (not near the equator), that would provide the same guarantee as a nuclear powerplant: 2GW of power, all year long. matthewdgreen 9 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s a list of sites planned for 2024 in the US [1]. The CD Solar Project has a 2GW capacity and a 1GW storage array.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.renewableenergyworld.com&#x2F;solar&#x2F;10-large-solar-pr... reply yodsanklai 1 hour agorootparentSo that answers my question. This doesn&#x27;t exist yet. 1GW storage isn&#x27;t 2. Also how long would this last if there&#x27;s no sun? (Sweden isn&#x27;t Nevada). reply grecy 10 hours agorootparentprev> then another 5-10 before you move to profitabilityWhy does it have to be run at a profit? Surely it could be just like healthcare or the defence forces - never designed or intended to run a profit. reply bruce511 5 hours agorootparentWell now, that depends on what country you are in. In the US for example health care and military most definitely are for-profit exercises.In the context of Sweden though, with social health care, and a modest military your question makes more sense. And of course as long as it has govt funding it doesn&#x27;t need to make a profit, or even break even.Once you look to private capital though, investors expect that capital to generate a return.Assuming no govt subsidy yo provide that return, it has to come from an excess after operational expenses. (aka profit) reply tuatoru 5 hours agorootparentprevProfit imposes discipline on consumption of the product. River water is classically treated as \"free\" which leads to great waste in agriculture and horitculture.Requiring a resource to be sold at a profit ensures it goes to where it is most needed, and that it is used efficiently. reply grecy 4 hours agorootparentSounds like you&#x27;ve read up on your capitalism.If your little tale was true, the USA would have cheaper and better healthcare than developed countries that have free healthcare.That is not the case. Your little tale doesn&#x27;t have to always be true, there are other ways of doing things in this world. reply tuatoru 56 minutes agorootparentWhere do you get \"cheaper\" from that? It certainly has \"better\" care for individuals ... at a price.Population health starts with urban design that forces people to walk. reply MostlyStable 11 hours agorootparentprevIf we subjected solar and wind to the same level of regulatory burden (as in: ensured that they would have the same level of expected harms&#x2F;deaths&#x2F;accidents as nuclear), they also would be completely unprofitable.If we subjected all our generation to the same regulatory burden, nuclear would be profitable again because our power would be drastically more expensive. reply ethanbond 11 hours agorootparentI am very pro nuclear but I am also very pro stringent regulation around nuclear.I don’t find the argument that nuclear reactors could be regulated as windmills super compelling, but that’s just me. reply Manuel_D 10 hours agorootparentSure nuclear&#x27;s regulations should be proportionate to its risks. But there&#x27;s still a strong argument to be made that nuclear is still over-regulated relative to its risks. It has the lowest death toll per watt of electricity produced of any generation source, even including Chernobyl. Furthermore, US plants built during periods of more relaxed regulation haven&#x27;t seen much in the realm of harmful mishaps. Three Mile Island is a testament to safety measures - it turns out building a big concrete condom over your reactor helps contain meltdowns. reply bruce511 5 hours agorootparent>> nuclear&#x27;s regulations should be proportionate to its risksto some extent this I what&#x27;s happening now. If a wind turbine (or indeed whole wind farm) catastrophically fails then you can clean it up in a matter of days or weeks. The range of potential damage in space and time, is very limited.By contrast catastrophic nuclear failure leads to immediate damage over a far larger area, and spans a much longer time (like hundreds of years. )One can quibble about deaths from chernobyl but it displaced an entire city and rendered a substantial chunk of land unusable for centuries.So I would argue that thd regulations are completely in line with the risks, as they stand right now. reply Manuel_D 4 hours agorootparentTo the contrary, nuclear contamination can be cleaned up. Fukushima&#x27;s exclusion zone was completely lifted after 11 years [1]. Pripyat was a planned city, built for the specific purpose of supporting the Chernobyl plant and it&#x27;s workers. It remains unremediated because there&#x27;s no incentive to clean it up, not because. Nuclear power has a smaller death toll per megawatt hour than wind, orders of magnitude less than hydropower and biomass [2].1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;30&#x2F;asia&#x2F;futaba-fukushima-nuclear...2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;death-rates-from-energy-p... reply MostlyStable 11 hours agorootparentprevWhile I personally think nuclear is overregulated, my point wasn&#x27;t even that you need to decrease regulation. I was just pointing that if current nuclear regulations demonstrate how safe we think our power generation should be, then wind and solar (and everything else) are under regulated, since they both kill more people&#x2F;MWh generated than nuclear does. reply ethanbond 11 hours agorootparent> if current nuclear regulations demonstrate how safe we think our power generation should be on a number of fatalities per MWh basis, then wind and solar (and everything else) are under regulatedI don&#x27;t think everyone agrees that fatalities per MWh is the right metric. reply robertlagrant 25 minutes agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t matter. It only matters if there&#x27;s a good reason to not measure it that way, and why another measure is better. reply CRConrad 3 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t think everyone agrees that fatalities per MWh is the right metric.Why not; what would be a better one? reply jacobedawson 11 hours agorootparentprevGenuine question - I wasn&#x27;t aware of this (fatalities per mwh for wind & solar), what would be the best source to find out more? reply philipkglass 10 hours agorootparentThis is as good of a source as any:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;death-rates-from-energy-p...However, be sure to dig into the methodology.Data on death rates from solar and wind is sourced from Sovacool et al. (2016) based on a database of accidents from these sources.We estimate deaths rates for nuclear energy based on the latest death toll figures from Chernobyl and Fukushima as described in our article here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;what-was-the-death-toll-from-cher...Note that the deaths for nuclear energy include only radiation related deaths, whereas the accidents for solar and wind include \"mundane\" accidents like workers falling from heights. Nuclear power plants have their own non-radioactive accidents, though, like this one:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shippai.org&#x2F;fkd&#x2F;en&#x2F;cfen&#x2F;CB1011025.html(5 workers killed at Mihama nuclear power plant due to accidental steam release)I have not seen any comparison that tries to sum up non-radioactive accidents for nuclear power and incorporate them in the deaths-per-TWh rate for nuclear power. The number will still be lower than anything based on combustion, but at these very low numbers it could make a meaningful difference in the relative rates. reply MostlyStable 10 hours agorootparentprevThis was the first publication I found from a google scholar search (there are others as well)[0]Nuclear has far fewer fatalities, but it&#x27;s accidents are also dramatically more expensive. Although both nuclear and hydro are having their numbers mostly driven by a single catastrophic event (the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure in China and Chernobyl), so how one feels about this whole analysis is going to depend on how likely one thinks future catastrophic events are to be. The numbers are so low that it&#x27;s hard to come up with very rigorous estimates.I personally think that catastrophic accidents on the scale of Chernobyl are as close to impossible these days as makes no difference. I&#x27;m not even too worried about Fukushima level events (which was not particularly deadly but was very expensive)However, I have to admit that my opinion on that isn&#x27;t really backed up be empirics, as is always going to be the case with rare events.[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S095965261... reply ZeroGravitas 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s bullshit.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;death-rates-from-energy-p...Even using sources from a decade ago, pro nuclear sources like world in data couldn&#x27;t find any credible sources to back that claim.And solar and wind were just getting started a decade ago. reply MostlyStable 10 hours agorootparentINteresting that they cite this exact paper in that figure but it has very different numbers (and is the newest of their citations).[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S095965261...-edit- yeah after further investigation, according to their \"learn more about this data\" button, the original source for that data is two publications, the one I linked, and the 2007 paper. The 2007 paper is primirly about comparing nuclear to fossil fuels, and mostly from the perspective of indirect effects from CO2. I&#x27;m skeptical of it&#x27;s claims, as that&#x27;s a bit too roundabout. The one I linked above is direct effects only (except that it includes cancer deaths from nuclear accidents), which I think goes too far in the other direction. I&#x27;d personally include deaths from particulate emissions from fossil fuel generation, but that has no bearing on the comparison between nuclear and wind&#x2F;solar.I don&#x27;t know how they ended up with the plot they display given the sources that they have, but I trust the graphs in the 2016 paper more, which show much larger effects.In any case, it&#x27;s certainly not true that there are no credible sources backing up the claim. One can dispute it, I&#x27;m sure, but there are credible sources backing it up. reply pstuart 7 hours agorootparentprevSmall Modular Reactors should make regulation a lot easier vs bespoke behemoth power plants.Unfortunately they still seem to be all promise and no deliveries. reply _aavaa_ 10 hours agorootparentprevExcept there isn’t a reason to do this. Solar panels do not have radiantion leaks. Wind turbines do not meltdown. Hydro damns don’t need millennia long storage plans for their waste.Nuclear being much more heavily regulated is due directly to it’s intrinsic dangers. reply MostlyStable 10 hours agorootparentThe reason we care about those things is that they kill people. It turns out that, even with those things, nuclear kills fewer people than everything else. Wind turbines kill people other ways. Hydro dams literally have the record for the single most catastrophic energy related disaster in the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure. And even dams that don&#x27;t fail are so much worse for the environment that I can&#x27;t even explain it. Dams on the west coast are probably the single biggest reason for the collapse of west coast salmon populations (among countless other species). Dams are an ecological disaster even when they are working perfectly. Nuclear at least has to fail before it causes major issues. reply kibwen 8 hours agorootparent> nuclear kills fewer people than everything elseFor some reason, this seems to have omitted solar power from the list of examples of technologies that have a higher body count than nuclear power. In the meantime, let&#x27;s examine how many cities have needed to be evacuated due to the catastrophic failure of solar plants. reply orwin 8 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re probably joking, but solar installation killed my uncle&#x27;s employee (he had 3), which made him sell his installation business (he still has 2 solar farms I think).I&#x27;m pretty sur solar kill more per generated MW than wind.The main difference is that solar&#x2F;wind only kill or inconvenience&#x2F;maim blue collar workers.

I&#x27;m not putting my credentials to boast, but to say that this is a threshold for \"unqualified.\"It&#x27;s just too easy to get something little wrong which makes your whole belief collapse.

Often it comes down to:1) There is no established community &#x2F; trade to build and maintain nuclear energy on a industrial stage. I live in the neighboring country (Norway), and the nuclear energy community here is pretty much 100% academic. There&#x27;s are nuclear engineering, tech, etc. programs, so in the start we&#x27;d have to import almost all the workers - all while starting our own programs.2) It&#x27;s a very long-term commitment, takes what, 10-15 years from shovel in ground to energy production? Compare that to wind energy and similar. The countries that really need energy, are needing it now.3) Many countries have long-term plans for energy, which were formed decades ago. This is the case of my country - they analyzed nuclear energy back in the 70s, and deemed it not suitable. They are still, almost 5 decades later, parroting the same strategy. \"We will focus on renewable hydro, wind, and solar energy, and concentrate funding to those sources\"4) There&#x27;s a non-trivial amount of political opposition - even though new tech is much, much more safe than the older plants. Nuclear is still big and scary, and some parties will vehemently oppose it - no mater what facts or findings you present to them.

All we have is evidence from those events that we&#x27;ve observed. The ocean is an incredibly destructive environment, hard to appreciate from a land based perspective. Ships are basically in continuous maintenance to keep them working and anything that isn&#x27;t made of a rust proof material is in for a very rough time.Reactors on various vessels have entirely different working parameters from those on shore and there the consumer is right next to the reactor. But in the case that you sketch you&#x27;d have a floating reactor tied to a stationary power grid that somehow is resilient to the worst that the ocean can throw at it. I just can&#x27;t see that working, even in the short term, let alone over the service life of a typical nuclear reactor.Ship-borne nuclear reactors have been used for emergency power, but that&#x27;s not a structural solution and it is also a very expensive one (compared to land based generation that power is quite expensive). So as soon as possible the emergency use is discontinued and it&#x27;s back to land based solutions.Off-shore windpower shows the complexity of ocean based power generation quite well and they have a much simpler safety situation, maintenance schedule, degree of complexity and so on. And even there the challenges are far more serious than the land based equivalent.Some work has been done on floating wind farms:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Floating_wind_turbineBut the economics are not comparable to those of anchored turbines (either off-shore on on-shore). Likely something similar would hold for nuclear power, that off-shore nuclear power would by default be far more expensive than on-shore nuclear power and that is already economically not feasible without massive subsidies. reply prawn 6 hours agorootparentprevI know very little about nuclear plants, but ignoring the usual risks, could it be anchored to the sea floor?

This makes it a poor companion to renewables.[1] Except for the couple of weeks a year when it&#x27;s down for maintenance, refueling, or its river&#x27;s water has gotten too hot or there isn&#x27;t enough of it, then the output is zero.

Increasing their capacity (across up to thousands of kilometers) isn&#x27;t easily done in a few years even. reply actionfromafar 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not an engineering problem either.The thing is though, a lot of heavy industry is built in the North to take advantage of the cheap power there.

At least that&#x27;s honest. reply s1artibartfast 10 hours agorootparentlets be clear, for your a grid, you have a base load that is basically constant, and then variation on top of that. You can think of as a base load and a variable load of another similar magnitude.The ideal source for base load is something that has an uptime as close to 100% as possible.Variable load is obviously the tricky part, because that is where you want storage to time shift, overbuilding to deal with seasonal changes, and build redundant peaker plants.

So most operators run their plants at maximum if possible just like what wind&#x2F;solar do when it is windy&#x2F;sunny.

Besides hydro also depends on weather, although on periods about 10 years or so. But when just once you don&#x27;t have enough water then what? reply samuell 13 hours agorootparentprevYea. You need to constantly produce the same amount of power that is being consumed, or you get a fall of the frequency in the system. Wind doesn&#x27;t care about that. You don&#x27;t need to look long at a graph showing the typical power production of wind vs something like nuclear over a day, to see that wind power is not only extremely unreliable. It also requires massive balancing measures from the other power types in the mix, which is sometimes easier said than done.You definitely want to let the wind power mostly \"top up\" the mix, and not constitute major parts of it, unless you have tons of something else to balance up the fluctuations with (related, nuclear is not great for balancing this, as it can&#x27;t typically change output quickly, but is great as the base load, just as the parent comment says). reply jug 13 hours agorootparentSpeaking of topping up which I agree with, I think it bears saying here that today with unexpanded nuclear in Sweden, wind accounts for only about 20% of energy production. Or if only including renewable sources NOT including nuclear, wind still only accounts for about 30%. reply bjourne 12 hours agorootparentNuclear power \"only\" accounts for 29% of total production. Wind and especially offshore wind has huge potential to expand, but the government has taken an obstructionist stance towards that mode of power production. It doesn&#x27;t make sense cutting wind subsidies amounting to a few billion while guaranteeing 400 billion to nuclear investments. reply samuell 12 hours agorootparentThere has already been challenges in balancing out the extreme fluctuations from wind with the current amount (leading to the need to start gas turbines which were meant for emergency power multiple times over the last few years, and even oil plants), and expanding it would only make this worse, as there would not be enough easily balancing power sources close by (hydro can be used to balance to some extent, but are hundreds to thousands of km away, with limited capacity in the extremely long power lines, meaning that it can&#x27;t account for all of that). reply bjourne 2 hours agorootparentNot quite true as the power meant for emergencies has not been activated. Oil power plants has been in use because oil prices have been low while electricity prices have been high. That the price of electricity fluctuates is a feature of the system not a drawback because it shapes consumer demand according to availability.The balance is built into the system. When elecricity prices are low wind power just disconnects generation capacity, while nuclear has to sell electricity for negative prices. reply actionfromafar 11 hours agorootparentprevI think society will have to adapt to wildly swinging rates.

During a stationary high pressure, you’ll have clear skies. Solar cells are more efficient when cold, and in fact in warmer countries the heat of midday can make them so inefficient that solar panels generate the most power in the morning and late afternoon. reply doikor 11 hours agorootparentIt is bad due to the short days and low angle of the sun.For example in Stockholm you get around 6h of daylight. Malmö (can’t really get further south than that) a bit over 7h.Basically the northern most point of mainland US is a lot further south than the most southern place in Sweden. Thinking about how good solar panels are in the winter in Anchorage gives you some idea (which has slightly slightly shorter days then Stockholm at around 5h30min at their shortest) reply jes5199 8 hours agorootparent6 hours of daylight, then you need to over-provision the solar so you can charge 18 hours worth of batteries in that time.

As the days are less then half as long you end up with ~1% the production vs summer.But in reverse the panels are really good during the summer as the days are very long. This is why people bother installing solar here. reply audunw 12 hours agorootparentprevIn the north thermal energy storage is a viable solution, and those can store energy for months. You can dump heat into them in summer and still pull from it in winter.Since heating is by far the biggest consumer of energy in winter, just taking care of that with stored thermal energy will deal with a big fraction of the energy storage needs.We need more districting heating systems. reply doikor 12 hours agorootparentWe are talking about 2 to 3 million MWh for Sweden alone (~120 million MWh yearly consumption so in reality probably a bit more then that as the consumption is higher in the winter).The largest battery based energy storage in the world is 3000 MWh so we just need to build thousand of those (or a 1000x larger one). Good luck with that.The largest heat storage under construction is 90000 MWh so that is a step in the right direction but still falls short by around 35x and even more if we have to turn that heat into electricity (While a lot of this consumption is district heating it is not all of it. And a large chunk of new district heating is just massive heat pumps)And now that you have built these tools to make wind&#x2F;solar work you have to factor the price of these into the price of wind&#x2F;solar and suddenly they do not look that cheap when compared to nuclear. This is why the government and Vattenfall in Sweden want to build more nuclear.Realistically the only cost effective energy storage on this scale we have available is hydro and pretty much all the places where it is cheap in Sweden have already been built.In general I think Sweden is on the right track. They have a lot of wind and are building a lot more of it. They can also build more nuclear at the same time.Though Sweden (just like here in Finland) are slowly reaching the point that when it is windy the wind farms don&#x27;t really make much money as the price on the spot markets is very close to 0 so we also need a lot of new intermittent energy consumption (industrial processes that can be slowed down&#x2F;ramped up cost effectively, make hydrogen, fill the heat storages with heat pumps, etc).

These include: HVDC to couple geographically distant regions, storage, flexible consumption, reduction of baseload consumption, hydro power for baseload, pricing based on source etc. reply eesmith 13 hours agorootparentprevSweden doesn&#x27;t use coal to any appreciable degree.Hydro provides about 42%, nuclear 29%, wind 21%, thermal power 5.8%, and \"unspecified\" at 1.9%.(Thanks to HN user fifilura who pointed people to the dashboard at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svk.se&#x2F;om-kraftsystemet&#x2F;kontrollrummet&#x2F; a few months ago, showing the real-time data and breakdown.) reply shinryuu 13 hours agorootparentprevSweden has a large amount of hydropower as baseload though. reply samuell 12 hours agorootparentThe hydro power is located in the far north(west), meaning that there is a bottle-neck in the hundreds to thousands of km of transport lines needed to bring it to the big cities in the south.The capacity of these lines is simply not enough to supply the cities in the south with only hydro power base load, which is why Sweden had the four major nuclear power stations built in the south, in the vicinity of major urban areas.It was a really well thought out system, that has been degrading over the last years for political reasons. reply jug 13 hours agorootparentprev> What if it’s not windy or sunny?Sweden is 528 000 km² and there is part a geographical spread even into sea which use to have weather patterns not following those at land, part complemented heavily by hydro, and part large battery parks already in use to complement wind.What kind of issues still remain after all these countermeasures? Still requiring countermeasures on the extremely costly scale of a massive nuclear expansion? reply samuell 13 hours agorootparentSweden has often very long transport routes for the energy, meaning that it is still a big challenge to supply the big cities, especially in the very south, with stable power, as the long transport routes don&#x27;t have capacity enough for the increasing demand from an increasingly electrified society (charging electric cars etc).As other comments are on to, you can&#x27;t rely on wind for base energy due to the extreme fluctuations in output. It isn&#x27;t uncommon with a few days of basically no wind at all in the whole country, typically when it is at its coldest, with temperatures sometimes around -30 - -40 C in the north, and perhaps -10 - -20 C in the south. Then you gotta have stable energy, or people&#x27;s lives might be at risk. reply kube-system 13 hours agorootparentprevAfter doing all of that, your wind and solar are no longer cheap.

Providing the same energy as nuclear in a stable maner (when I say stable I mean more that 3-4hrs of backup from batteries) is hard with solar, wind sounds better but has downsides too. And also, why not both? Sweden is already among top cleanest energy countries. They can afford to make longterm bets in reliable nuclear energy. They already afaik almost finished their storage site. Maybe building more nuclear will make further building cheaper by growing expertise in this field, anyway, thing is, they can afford to think long term, it&#x27;s up to other countries to decarbonize, like, say, Germany that refused to keep their nuclear on to make transition smoother and are bashing on France bc they have too cheap nuclear energy reply swatcoder 13 hours agoparentprevWell, if post-Cold War globalized trade looks more like it might be regressing to a more fractured and unstable landscape, it would make sense to maximize one’s own readiness and make robust, safe investments that were previously hoped to be unnecessary.In that context, spinning up local (and tightly allied) nuclear power might make more sense than it did in an idealized globalist world where you could trust that your investment in some North African solar array was less likely to be disrupted by some political realignment or exploited leverage. reply durandal1 13 hours agoparentprevIf there was a solar&#x2F;wind requirement that operators had to purchase the equivalent production to cover base load when not producing power, solar&#x2F;wind wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as cheap. reply sva_ 13 hours agoparentprevSolar is only one big volcano eruption away from potentially producing almost no energy for possibly months at a time[0].

Nuclear still seems like it could be a reasonable&#x2F;viable&#x2F;necessary option for decarbonized energy production.The realistic worst case is that we waste some money building nuclear power plants that operate at a loss and are potentially decommissioned early.Assuming we collectively have enough money to also keep building wind&#x2F;solar&#x2F;etc (it seems like we do!), and the risk of failing to decarbonize remains catastrophic, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to hedge our bets and try all the viable options.My guess is that we build a few crappy nuclear power plants with poor economics, learn some really useful things in the process, and then build some better ones with much more favorable economics. reply veqq 13 hours agoparentprevNuclear&#x27;s cost drivers are entirely regulatory. reply nvy 12 hours agorootparentFor mostly good reasons, though.Safety systems are a cost center, but they&#x27;d have prevented Chernobyl. reply jayski 13 hours agoparentprevenergy storage technology is still lacking. which means we burn coal or gas when the sun isn&#x27;t shining. reply Ekaros 13 hours agorootparentSweden with Norway should have enough hydro capacity, but it is not where demand is.

    "originBody": "Home » From email to phone number, a new OSINT approach 24 Comments August 13, 2019 From email to phone number, a new OSINT approach Lately I’ve been spending time researching weaknesses and attack vectors in password reset options. At BSides Las Vegas I presented a tool called “Ransombile”. It automates the password reset process over SMS for many Alexa top 100 websites and facilitates targeted attacks when having physical access to locked mobile devices for a short period of time. I’ve also talked about the wide impact of compromising voicemail systems at DEF CON and CCC by abusing password reset over phone calls. While working on these topics, I spent many hours testing and resetting passwords in various different websites. At some point, I started noticing a pattern I hadn’t noticed before. When you want to reset a password, you enter the email and are then presented with different options. Those usually include receiving an email with a unique link to click on, getting an SMS with a secret six digit code or even the option to receive a call and hear the secret code instead. While reviewing the option of resetting a password with either an SMS or phone call, I noticed that the UI usually shows part of the phone number. However it is masked in a way that it will reveal only a few digits, enough for the user to recognize which one in case he has multiple phones. In other words, if I know your email, I can initiate the password reset process for your accounts and obtain several digits of your phone number. As mentioned above, I’ve spent a lot of time resetting passwords and I realized that not all websites reveal the same digits. Some would show the last four, some would show the first one, the last two and so on. There is no standard way to mask personal identifiable information (PII) such as phone numbers. The masking happens entirely at the developers discretion and that seemed like a problem to me. Password reset shows 5 digits 2FA shows 3 digits To demonstrate to which extent this is the case, take Paypal for example. If I initiate the password reset process, it will reveal the first digit and the last four. But, if I login and get challenged with 2FA, it will reveal only the last three. This doesn’t make any sense. With only your email address, I can get five of your ten digits phone number. If I know your email and password, then I’ll only get three. Paypal hides more digits from an attacker that knows your password already than from one that only knows your email address. Digging deeper I made a list of popular websites that people tend to be registered on and checked their password reset process. My goal was to identify which sites would only ask for an email to initiate the process (no further information needed), supported mobile based password reset and number of digits “leaking”. Here is a small subset: Leaks first three and last two digits: eBay Leaks first and last four digits: Paypal Leaks first and last two digits: Yahoo Leaks last four digits: Lastpass Leaks last two digits: Google Facebook Twitter Hotmail Steam If you look at the list above, we can conclude that, for example, if you have an eBay and a LastPass account, an attacker can know seven out of ten digits of your phone number. Just by knowing your email address. In other words, an attacker can use your email address to reduce the possibilities of guessing your phone number from one billion possibilities to one thousand. This is not the only combination possible but let’s focus on this scenario in this post. Discovering the remaining numbers We have seven out of ten digits which means we are only missing three. At this point, it is important to focus on which numbers we know. A US phone number is composed of 3 fields: area code (or NPA), exchange (or Central Office Code) and subscriber number (kudos to @jjarmoc who told me about the exchange and made me realize there was more to this than I thought). There is also the country code but we are focusing on US numbers for now. US phone number fields eBay+LastPass gave us the area code and the subscriber number. It is important to highlight that we are not simply missing 3 digits, we are missing the 3 digits corresponding to the exchange. This is an important distinction as it will help us narrow down the possibilities even further. NANPA I put quite a number of hours researching and learning about exchanges. My main goal was to understand if I could reliably reduce the remaining thousand possible phone numbers by detecting exchange numbers not assigned to a specific area code. Enter the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA). The numbering plan for the public switched telephone network for Canada, the US and its territories, and some Caribbean countries. This website is a goldmine! I learned so much about how the telephone systems work just from this source. Most importantly, I found exactly what I was looking for. NANPA maintains an updated list of area codes and the corresponding exchanges that is publicly accessible. It is updated frequently and you can query the data or download a parseable file with all the information. Exchanges in San Francisco How useful is this? Well, let’s take San Francisco’s 415 area code. If I am only missing the three digits corresponding to the exchange, I have a thousand possible numbers for my target. By using NANPA dataset, I reduced it to 784 possible numbers because there are 216 exchange number not assigned to 415 area code. That is a reduction of over 20%, not bad! But how good does it get? I played with different area codes and, for example, the Alaska 907 area code has only 625 exchanges assigned. That’s 375 phone numbers we don’t need to consider anymore by just using the valuable information that NANPA provides us. Or Tacoma’s 253 area code with only 458 exchanges. We got rid of over half the possible phone numbers. What if the target only has a Paypal account? We know five out of ten digits. But again, which ones? We have the first digit of the area code and the last four random digits. Let’s imagine that you know the target is from California. Thanks to NANPA, we know all the area codes corresponding to California. There are only two area codes in California that start with 2, 213 and 209. Other two that start with 3, two that start with 4, etc. By knowing the first digit of the area code, you can still infer the first three digits of the phone number fairly easy. National Pooling Administration But how about if the target only has an eBay account? Or Paypal + Google? We have the area code and the last two digits of the subscriber number. Again, let’s focus on which numbers we know. I discussed above how we can use NANPA’s public records to narrow down possible numbers based on the area code and the exchange. Are there any public records that can help us discard invalid phone numbers based on the subscriber number? Yes! Thanks to the national pooling administration. Ready? Number pooling is a way to assign smaller blocks of numbers (in the thousands) to growth areas. Historically, a phone number is a way of rooting a call to a person in a physical location. Take 415-272-XXXX. The first 3 digits narrow it down to a wider area like San Francisco, the 272 exchange is specific to Sausalito and the missing 4 digits specify the actual person (subscriber) in that limited area. Because carriers own the specific area code + exchange, this means that there area 10000 phone numbers assigned to Sausalito residents that have a plan with AT&T (the carrier owning 415-272). As of 2017, Sausalito has 7110 residents. This means that from the 10k available numbers, only 7k will be used, and that if everyone is an AT&T customer. With this way of assigning numbers, many are going to waste and will not be used. The irruption of cable modems and VOIP services which made it easier to become a carrier worsened the problem. The FCC decided that numbers should be assigned in smaller blocks in growth areas. Specifically in blocks of thousand numbers rather than ten thousand. Therefore, blocks of numbers would be assigned as XXX-XXX-X to carriers, including the first digit of the subscriber number. The national pooling administration is responsible for managing it and has public records of the assigned blocks, including the subscriber digit. We can use this data to further discard invalid numbers. For example, taking our Sausalito number 415-272-XXXX which is missing the last 4 digits, we can use the public records to discard phone numbers like 415-272-[0-8]XXX and focus just on numbers which subscriber starts with 9. In other words, we have reduced the possible valid phone numbers from 10 thousand to one thousand. 9th block is the only one assigned Still… many possible numbers remaining You have your target’s email address who happens to be from Tacoma and has an eBay and LastPass account. You initiate the password reset process and harvest seven out of ten digits of his phone number. Now, you can use NANPA to get rid of 542 and reduce the list to 458 possible numbers assigned to that email address. Then you use the National Pooling Administration to check if the block number yo have is assigned to the different possible exchanges reducing the possible valid phone numbers to 445. What now? It is still a fair amount of phone numbers. I would claim that reducing one billion possible phone numbers down to 445 only knowing an email is pretty significant. The remainder could even be tested manually. But the goal is to reduce the possibilities as much as possible before attempting any manual verification. Let’s go back to the drawing board! There is a number of ways you could take the remaining phone numbers and see if they are somehow linked to the email address. Using search engines with well defined search flags to try find clues in case the target left his phone number in a forum, website, etc. Look the email up by phone number on online services like pipl, BeenVerified or Spokeo that have huge databases with people’s personal information. You could even use telephone system online services that allow you to reverse search the owner of a phone by its number. Basically, a phonebook in reverse. I was actually pretty shocked by the amount of personal information I was able to get from services like WhitePages via it’s Twilio add-on by just providing a phone number and pay ten cents. These options are good but not 100% reliable. You may not find anything in search engines, online data farms don’t have your target’s phone number and WhitePages tends to be somewhat outdated, many times it just doesn’t have the information you need. So, I started to think of new ways I could reliably obtain the phone number assigned to an email address. Reusing the same attack vector, in reverse It did not take long to get to that sweet “Eureka” moment. I reflected on the steps I took to get this far. I was abusing the password reset function of online services to collect a few phone number digits assigned to an email… Hmmm.. I reset the password putting an email… and I get a few digits back. Can I… reset the password by entering a phone number and get a few email characters back? Amazon password reset using phone number Eureka! Turns out, there are popular services, like Amazon and Twitter, that allow you to reset the password by entering a phone number and get an email to complete the process. Most importantly, it will display a few characters of the email address it will send the link to. In Amazon’s case, you get the first and last letter of the username and the full domain. You also get the length of the username as the number of * matches the number of masked chars. Twitter shows you the first two characters of the username and the first one of the domain. You also will know the length by counting the asterisks. The attack vector looks like this: 1. Use the target’s email address to initiate the reset password process in multiple sites to harvest several phone number digits 2. Reduce the possible phone number list by discarding non-existing area codes, exchanges and subscriber numbers using NANPA and the National Pooling Administration publicly available data 3. Initiate the password reset process iterating over the remainder phone number list and correlate the leaked email chars against the target’s email address By following these steps, you will be able to obtain the full ten digit phone number associated to the email address, without having to make one single call! Just by abusing password reset options and bruteforcing efficiently using publicly available information. Automation The attack vector above can be done manually. You can use services like namechk to pinpoint where to go harvest digits. Look at NANPA’s data yourself to discard invalid numbers. You could even bruteforce the remaining phone numbers to find the matching email using web proxy features like Burp’s intruder. But you don’t need to, I wrote a tool that will do all this for you. email2phonenumber is a tool that allows you to provide a partial phone number and get a list of all the possible valid phone numbers, eliminating non-existing area code and exchange numbers. The tool will also let you bruteforce phone numbers using Amazon’s and Twitter’s password reset feature and correlate the masked emails against the one you provided looking for a match. It will attempt to fly under the captcha radar by replicating user behavior and randomizing some parameters in the requests. It also supports the use of proxy servers. What we are doing is starting the password reset for different phone numbers. This means that the services cannot detect you based on a specific phone number you are hammering on. There are multiple other services that allow password reset using phone numbers that can be used for the same purpose. The tool supports Amazon and Twitter for bruteforcing. The idea is to get support from the community through pull requests to support additional ones. You can find the tool in my github repo. Demo phonerator email2phonenumber is a great tool but much of what it does can be done with tools like Burp or wfuzz. The true power relies on the gathering, parsing and use of the public available data related to a country’s phone numbering plan. Therefore, I am working on a new online service that would allow you ti generate lists of possible phone numbers. It will have multi-country support, it will give you much more information and details, it will have historical records and most importantly, advanced filters. Say you know the target has AT&T, you can filter by carrier and reduce the list of possible numbers even more. You may have intel that the person is from California, phonerator will take into account only those area codes. Maybe you know that the target had the phone number for over two years, so let’s discard exchanges and block numbers that were assigned recently. I am still working on the tool and collecting all data. Please stay tuned for updates and release dates on my twitter account. It’s finally here! Other countries So far I’ve focused on US phone numbers but there are additional issues I want to highlight when considering targets from other countries. I am from Spain myself and Spanish mobile phone numbers have interesting properties as well. For starters, all mobile phone numbers start with the digit 6 (and recently 7). Also, phone numbers are only 9 digits long. Why is that important? Well, I know one digit from the beginning and services like eBay or LastPass do not adjust their mask to leak less digits for shorter phone numbers. Therefore, if my target is from Spain, just with LastPass I know 5 out of the 9 digits. That’s over half the digits. I’ve observed the problem of using the same mask for all customers in other websites as well. My next step was to look for countries that had very short numbers. Take Iceland, Estonia or San Salvador with 7 digit phone numbers. All eBay customers from these countries have 5 out of 7 digits exposed to anyone that knows their email address. Combine it with LastPass accounts and you got yourself the target’s full phone number. Just by knowing their email address… First 3 and last 2 with Ebay Last 4 with LastPass By understanding the properties of a country phone number system and taking advantage of websites that do not adjust their masking to leak less digits on shorter numbers, it is possible to harvest all digits of the phone number. So what? I showed you how to go from an email address to a phone number. So what? Is that really so bad? Well, we can answer this question from different angles like privacy and security but let’s list a number of attack vectors that originate from the knowledge of a target’s phone number: SIM swapping. This is an issue that gained a lot of notoriety lately and it is more common than you might think. Attackers are able to port your phone number to a SIM in their control by different means like social engineering, extortion or even rogue carrier employees. This would allow the attackers to reset passwords on your behalf or bypass 2FA protections. SS7 attacks. SS7 is a protocol used by carriers to interact among them. It is very old and researchers have demonstrated at multiple security conferences how they can track the location of individuals, or even spy on communications. Targeting your voicemail. Check out my DEF CON talk to understand the impact of having an attacker compromise your voicemail. Seriously, voicemail systems are a threat. Location tracking. Joseph Cox has done a great coverage of this issue. CallerID spoofing. Plenty of online services allow you to spoof caller IDs. This is a great tool for social engineering. Conclusions The lack of a standardized way to mask PII leads to different approaches taken by online services. These are leaking partial information about your email address and phone number in places like the reset password area. It can be abused and automated to scrape pieces of information with the intent of reconstructing the targeted data. It is possible, specially on targeted attacks, to obtain all digits of a phone number associated to an email address. Once the attacker is in possession of the phone number, he can use it for other attacks with serious impact that can lead to full account compromise, location tracking and spying. This is specially true in countries with shorter phone numbers, as many services do not adjust their masking to the phone length. Masking is not good enough, even if it just shows a couple of the phone number’s digits. Inhabitants of Saint Helena deserve the same security bar as the rest of us with their 5 digits long phone numbers. For emails, masking only the username is not sufficient, the domain can provide information about where that person may work. Even the TLD can give away if that person is a student or from which country they might be. My proposal is to allow users to set labels. For example, the user can label an email address as “personal email” or the phone number as “work phone”. This way, when the password reset process displays a hint, it will show the label rather than tidbits of PII. Users should not provide their phone number unless strictly required. Many online services ask for it but there is no real business need. They just want more information about you. If it is a requirement, consider using a virtual number like Google Voice or even a dedicated SIM that you only use for this purpose and never give the number away. This is not just about OPSEC, it’s about keeping your data secure. Responsible disclosure I reached out to the online services that were showing more than 2 digits, especially if they were part of the area code or exchange. LastPass updated the mask to just show the last two digits corresponding to the subscriber number. eBay is showing now the first and last two digits, not great but better than it was before. Yahoo is still considering risks and mitigations as of this writing. Paypal, which displays five digits including area code to anyone knowing the email address (but only three if the attacker knows the target’s password), decided this is working as designed and will not take action.

We had communicated on a few different platforms. Each platform offered up a little piece of his identity. Last four of this. First four of that. It was enough to piece it all together. I gave him a call at his place of employment which happened to be in the exact same industry as the parts that were being sold. I asked him to ship the parts and casually asked if his employer was involved in the sale. He perked right up and the next day he shipped everything I had bought and a few extras. reply 1nd1ansumm3r 11 hours agoparentI re-read this, not to fire back but to understand how you arrive at your conclusion. I think you are interpreting (or assuming maybe), from when I asked about his employer, that I suspected he stole the parts from his employer. That&#x27;s not the case at all.

Many carriers don&#x27;t display this data as far as I believe, but most of them make it available.Querying that database isn&#x27;t free, but you could probably find a way to do it for a few hundred numbers relatively cheaply.

Postpaid cell paone plans have been the \"default\" in the US for a long time, though prepaid seems to be gaining market share. reply maxerickson 10 hours agorootparentWe are kind of assuming a lot when a $100 a month account obviously requires a credit check.They require a SSN because people don&#x27;t care and it makes it cheaper to offer the accounts, not because it would actually be a big problem to sell internet service without credit checks. reply xp84 8 hours agorootparentThe credit checks, the carriers would tell you, are to try to protect them against people who sign up for service with a \"free\" phone on a 3 year commitment (phone paid for in part by 36 installments of credits) and then they stop paying the bill. Sure the phone will be blacklisted and remain SIM-locked, but could still be used on Wi-Fi and either way the carrier can&#x27;t have it back and is therefore out their cost of the phone.Now, as for why they still do the same credit checks when you bring your own phone, I suspect \"Because F you, that&#x27;s why\" is the gist of it. reply pyinstallwoes 3 hours agorootparentprevThat’s pretty normal in the USA. reply saltminer 16 hours agoprev> If it is a requirement, consider using a virtual number like Google Voice or even a dedicated SIM that you only use for this purpose and never give the number away.For the second SIM option, that requires a dual-SIM device, which are still fairly niche in the US.When it comes to VOIP numbers, unfortunately, many sites look up phone numbers and block VOIP providers, which sucks because Android still has no good way of sending&#x2F;receiving carrier texts on the desktop (and before someone suggests the Google Messages web interface, it \"forgets\" my device too often for me to take it seriously). Occasionally, this can create a catch 22, where the VOIP blocking is implemented after the fact and prevents you from ever using the account again because the VOIP blocking was also implemented on the SMS 2FA.And then there&#x27;s services which don&#x27;t even bother to check if they can actually reach a number before accepting it. Harris Teeter pharmacies, for example, will happily accept a VOIP number, but their system is unable to call or text VOIP numbers, so you never get your prescription notices. (And I&#x27;d bet this applies to all Kroger brands since they share a lot of systems.) reply pavon 14 hours agoparentI broke down and bought a prepaid SIM and a small dumb phone which I use solely for 2FA.

Dual SIM typically allows both SIMs&#x2F;phone-numbers to be active and when you receive a call, you will know which number is being called.

Firesheep was a firefox plugin that anyone could run on a public wifi (e.g. coffee shop) and instantly start getting the passwords of anyone on the same network that logged in to anything over http. At the time Facebook was http by default. So, it made the news and forced Facebook to make https required basically overnight. Many other companies followed suit, and it&#x27;s likely fair to say that the release of that plugin single-handedly accelerated https adoption by a considerable margin.I don&#x27;t know that this release will be that impactful, but its certainly better than having this be a technique that only black hats know about. reply lainga 14 hours agorootparentThe difference between 2010 (firesheep) and now is about $100B of regulatory capture.

PHOTO: MATT ROURKE/ASSOCIATED PRESS A lawsuit alleging that real-estate software company RealPage illegally fixes rents at millions of apartments should go forward, the U.S. Justice Department said in a court filing. Tenants earlier this year filed a complaint in a Tennessee federal court alleging RealPage and landlords that use its algorithmic pricing system to set rents are violating antitrust laws. The use of this pricing system has limited competition in the housing market and resulted in higher rents for tenants, the complaint alleges. Copyright ©2023 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A very normal occurrence.I went to the leasing office and asked to extend. We sat down and they typed some info into the computer. They said I could get the lease extension for 50% more than my current rate per month.This seemed ludicrous so I asked why it was so expensive. They calmly explained about the new software they were using which set the rates for all new leases, which they were not authorized to override. They said the increased cost was due to the very large new building which went up a couple blocks away. Not owned by the same company. The building had been completed around December the year before. Many tenants were expected to be leaving around that time when their 1-year lease was up.I couldn&#x27;t believe this could be legal and asked the agent how this was legal to collude with another building. He said it sure seemed odd but all of the buildings in this city had just started using this software. This was just some guy working in a leasing office but he claimed it was because the boom in high-rise apartments in the city had created too much competition and the owners had all agreed to use this software to fix that.Eventually, after some back-and-forth, I learned that changing my lease end date by a couple days reduced the rent increase from 50% to 5%. So I ended up with a 3 month and 6 day extension. reply Sebguer 8 hours agoparentI got a renewal notice a few months ago, and they wanted to raise my already pretty high rent by like 15%. It was higher than what they charge for brand new apartments, not even counting leasing incentives. I made a counter-offer and got told &#x27;we don&#x27;t negotiate&#x27;. The propublica article (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;yieldstar-rent-increase-r...) talks about how exactly this lack of negotiation &#x2F; removing the human element lets them drive up rents across the board.It&#x27;s insane, and toxic. reply thelastgallon 8 hours agorootparentExperienced the same system in the Bay Area. Rent increases by 300 - 500, but the new lease is lower. You can try signing a lease on a new apartment and deal with the logistics of moving, having some period of extension&#x2F;overlapping rent payment, which is a huge hassle and may not even save you money. reply jonhohle 6 hours agorootparentWhy would they want to add the expense of cleaning out an additional apartment, additional wear and tear, and pissing off a tenant who is likely to leave in the future only to collect less rent for the privilege? There must be some MBAs involved in that brilliant maneuver. reply jm4 6 hours agorootparentBecause they calculate they are more willing to do that than the tenant is willing to move. It only costs them a month or two of the difference in rent they are going to charge a new tenant. They still make thousands more in the end.Meanwhile, the tenant has to pay more money to move than it costs the landlord to rent the place again. The landlord knows they so they offer an extension at an increase of about the same amount it would cost to move.They are betting they can do absolutely nothing and make more money. Even if they lose that bet, they still make more money.There is zero downside when there is high demand for housing and other landlords are doing the same thing. reply landedgentry 6 hours agorootparentprevMy landlord uses RealPage and the property manager told me they (my building) target a 50% churn rate. If fewer than 50% of households move out at the end of their lease, they know they&#x27;re not increasing rents fast enough. reply dwaltrip 6 hours agorootparentThat’s insane. reply lumost 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you have nowhere to go, then the rent is whatever the landlord says it is. reply koolba 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a game of chicken. reply zzleeper 7 hours agoparentprevAlso around DC area, the leasing office folks told me that the price changed dynamically and could only be overruled by the HQ. They said that many companies use that software in order to obtain their \"optimal\" price for the area, which is of course observationally equivalent to colluding with extra steps.BTW, more recently I saw the same thing with large contractor companies. One quoted me an insane price for something and I asked why, and they replied that it&#x27;s the price that the software (ServiceTitan) tells them to charge, and even showed me their screen.Again, they said ServiceTitan decides the price depending on \"the average price of other companies in the area\" which is code word for you-know-what. reply devchix 6 hours agorootparentAm I missing the obvious here, a smart and nimble company can corner this market by lowering their price by X. They would have to give up X per unit but they make it up by (volume * lower_price). Isn&#x27;t that how the market is supposed to work? Like if I want all the business and there&#x27;s not an obvious differentiator I will compete on price? reply koube 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not how it works because there is no volume. You can&#x27;t provide more supply if there&#x27;s no supply to provide. Each building has a fixed number of units and the management for those buildings are trying to maximize the value they get out of each unit. Most cities have a mostly inelastic number of units and population grows every year, so you can pretty much charge whatever you want and people will pay it since there&#x27;s no alternatives.Why doesn&#x27;t someone just build a new building? Mostly they will be blocked by NIMBYism. NIMBYism is a near universal philsophy, to the point that renters who would benefit from this are typically NIMBYs too. Sometimes they&#x27;re the loudest NIMBYs, It will be pretty much impossible to build anything new until the state takes control of building away from localities and forces them to allow building. reply devchix 6 hours agorootparentThis assumes vacancy is at 0%, for cities like SF I can see this, but do all cities have near 0% vacancy rate? Genuine question, I don&#x27;t know. I would offer at lower price and have all my units filled. reply dchftcs 6 hours agorootparentprevNot sure about smart, but the word \"nimble\" can never be used to described anything about real estate. reply peyton 6 hours agorootparentprevTypically the price fixing part is one small feature of a large software suite, and deviations require written justification submitted to the provider (with the implied threat of losing access to the management software). reply dataviz1000 8 hours agoparentprevThis is how dynamic pricing for event tickets works. Everyone uses the same software which prices tickets across all secondary and primary markets. One way to create artificial scarcity to inflate prices is not offer tickets or apartments for rent. Another way is to initially charge outrageous prices so that a less outrageous price is more appealing. Like a parent paying outrageous prices for a Taylor Swift concert months in advance insure that their child can see the show for their birthday people looking for apartments are forced at the artificially inflated prices because that location has their employment and social connections. reply autoexec 8 hours agoparentprev> They said the increased cost was due to the very large new building which went up a couple blocks away. Not owned by the same company.The system is beyond broken when an increase in the supply of housing by a competitor results in higher prices for everybody. reply freeone3000 8 hours agorootparentWell, you see, the new fancy construction has to pay off its construction loans so it has to rent at an increased price. The small apartment buildings have to match it, or they’re simply leaving money on the table. reply thwarted 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah, this makes no sense and is pretty blatantly bogus to anyone with at least a high school understanding of supply and demand and is also pretty blatant collusion. They didn&#x27;t also trot out gentrification, due to the new building going up, as a reason to raise the rent too? reply WillPostForFood 6 hours agorootparentprevYou shouldn&#x27;t always expect prices to go down when there is new supply, because it can also increase demand. If people are investing and building new units in a neighborhood, it is usually improving it, which makes it more desirable, more people want to live in the area, and prices go up. If you are lucky, this reduces demand elsewhere and overall prices might drop. reply autoexec 4 hours agorootparent> If people are investing and building new units in a neighborhood, it is usually improving it, which makes it more desirableI&#x27;d argue that most people in the US don&#x27;t want to live next to giant apartment complexes, even if they themselves already live in one. People like sun, and skylines, and space. An attractive, well maintained apartment building that has parking for all it&#x27;s residents in an area that&#x27;s not too crowded doesn&#x27;t have to hurt the neighborhood, but it&#x27;s not going to make it more desirable. At best it just accommodates the people who already want to live there. reply epistasis 6 hours agorootparentprevNo, you should absolutely expect prices to drop, it&#x27;s extremely well documented.However, landlord advocates spread the counter narrative, of people mistaking symptom for cause, and unsophisticated public laps it up. People hate to see change and want to blame new buildings for high prices, even though they lower them universally. reply treyd 7 hours agoparentprevMy building also uses RealPage and I got the lease renewal notice the other day. I was on the way out when I saw the note so I skimmed it and only saw the \"20% increase\" number not realizing it was for if I wanted to switch to a month-to-month lease. When I read it fully later it ended up only being a ~3% lease for a full year, which is actually kinda reasonable considering other rents I saw in the area on Zillow. Very strange.(Boston.) reply notyourwork 8 hours agoparentprevAll too eerily similar to my experience in both a Seattle and a San Francisco apartment. The whole thing reeked of illegal collusion. reply ethbr1 7 hours agoparentprev> he claimed it was because the boom in high-rise apartments in the city had created too much competition and the owners had all agreed to use this software to fix that.Rent homogenization software is doing the same thing realtor associations have done for years -- offer incentives to users who hold the line on \"standard\" pricing and penalizing those that don&#x27;t.Then wrap the above scheme up in something more convoluted so it doesn&#x27;t immediately look like collusion. reply huitzitziltzin 9 hours agoprevSo, I view this case as likely unsettled under current US antitrust law.The underlying behavior seems really objectionable and should be illegal. The question is whether it is actually illegal under the law.If a bunch of firms use the same software to set prices but do so independently and without any attempt to coordinate with each other… that’s a pretty decent defense?(Can they argue that they had no knowledge of their competitors’ use of the software? There may of course be internal emails saying “we know X is also using it.” Suppose there aren’t AND the software vendor promised exclusivity to all of them independently. Would we want this to be illegal? What if all of the firms offer similar products and set prices by estimating the same demand curve?? This becomes a little far fetched of course.)I don’t view this as obviously “per se illegal” territory. I would love to be wrong bc yeah it’s really objectionable, but I don’t think the case is a slam dunk.So called “algorithmic collusion” of which this is likely an example is an unsettled area of theory reply DannyBee 8 hours agoparentLawyer here. Hard disagree. The software is sold for the purpose of reducing competition, and gives advice on how to best achieve that. Everyone colluding is buying and using the software with a goal of not competing with each other.That is just about a textbook case.You can remove the software. Imagine you all pay someone to write a number on a piece of paper that gets posted on a light pole once a month. You don&#x27;t get a say what the number is, but you all agree to set prices at that number 80% of the time.This is illegal. Even if you remove the 80% and say \"we recommend you use this number 80% of the time to maximize your non competition\", it would be illegalThis is not a close case. Fixing the price this way is illegal. Agreeing not to compete at all is illegal. It does not matter if you get someone else to set the price. At the point you all agree not to compete, you&#x27;ve clearly violated the act.As for whether it&#x27;s per-se illegal, per-se illegal went out the window on basically all illegal acts under the sherman act over the past few decades, except a few remaining forms of price-fixing.But you would still win the cases under the rule of reason anyway, and it would not be close there either.People seem really hung up on whether they agreed with each other explicitly.They don&#x27;t have to. Conspiracy suffices. Tacit agreement is not illegal, but it has to be truly tacit. This is not. As I said elsewhere: it is illegal for them to conspire to not compete matter what the form of the conspiracy.However if they just aren&#x27;t competing, you can&#x27;t order them to compete.This is a clear case of the former - they are conspiring towards a common non competition goal. They knew what would happen if they conspired this way.It&#x27;s like trying to avoid a conspiracy to commit murder charge by saying you never explicitly agreed to hire a particular hitman, you instead just followed the directions some software gave you when it said \"in order to maximize the possibility of your husband being dead, we recommend depositing at least five million at the following address\". Good luck with your claim that you didn&#x27;t agree to anything with anyone - you were just maximizing some probabilities.Hell, i bet when they do discovery the company has not been as careful as they think, and there are chats&#x2F;emails about how successfully they&#x27;ve been able to destroy competition or raise prices or whatever. Because there always is. reply dboreham 7 hours agorootparentOne of the best IAAL posts ever. reply adonovan 6 hours agorootparentHeh, dannybee once called me (we work for the same employer) and said: \"I see you are using a particular pointer analysis algorithm. Stop it right now, it&#x27;s tainted with patents. BTW I am a lawyer. But: I&#x27;m also a pointer analysis expert, and you don&#x27;t want that algorithm, it sucks, this other one is better.\"I&#x27;m confident the number of lawyers with pointer analysis expertise in this world can be counted on the fingers of one hand... probably even after a gruesome lawnmower accident. reply CableNinja 2 hours agorootparentprevNot a lawyer, you made this pretty easy to understand, and clearcut collusion.Also, your example for the hitman would make a great half-serious murder comedy movie reply jfoutz 6 hours agorootparentprevI really hope you&#x27;re right. But I really wonder if it&#x27;d actually hold up if tested. I don&#x27;t want to wildly derail the conversation, but I can&#x27;t help but observe - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realpage.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;crow-holdings-enters-strategic...Maybe it&#x27;ll all work out. reply zer0x4d 4 hours agorootparentprevSlack&#x2F;Teams, the downfall of major corps. I bet once they do discovery on them, they&#x27;d come across some juicy evidence. reply sklargh 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is always a five forces slide. Always. reply adolph 8 hours agorootparentprevIs the Sherman Antitrust Act the legal basis for the lawsuit against the software company?The Sherman Antitrust Act seems to deal with interstate commerce. Clearly the software is sold in many states. Some rental markets are multi-state. Some apartment management companies are multi-state. Would it apply to those rental markets and management companies that are not interstate? reply MacsHeadroom 6 hours agorootparentThe supreme court says raising your own cattle for your own personal consumption is interstate commerce because you are replacing a purchase of beef in an interstate market.So, you don&#x27;t even have to participate in commerce for your actions to be considered \"interstate commerce,\" much less participate in an actual interstate commerce. reply DannyBee 7 hours agorootparentprevIn general, most state antitrust and unfair competition laws mirror the Sherman act. So even if you could construct a purely intrastate scenario, it would not make much difference in practice. reply madars 7 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know about merits of this case but some of the controlling interstate commerce interpretations are quite broad: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wickard_v._Filburn Even growing your own wheat affects interstate commerce: your alternative to growing it yourself is buying it on the open market. This is an activity which, in aggregate across thousands of farmers, would affect interstate commerce. reply ethanbond 9 hours agoparentprevThey did coordinate: the software had a policy that you had to take their recommendation at least n% of the time (I think 80?)Edit: Per discussion below, it was merely strongly encouraged and effectively followed (in practice) to take the recommendation at least 80% of the time... in order to raise prices together... reply bombcar 9 hours agorootparentThis might end up being the lynchpin - the software sounds like a textbook cartel. reply mcmoor 8 hours agorootparentThis fact either make it 100% a cartel or is actually false and keep being repeated on HN for some reason. reply s1artibartfast 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think that is true from reading the complaint - there wasnt any mandatory requirement, but guidelines on how to use the algorithm. reply ethanbond 9 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hausfeld.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;550bhzyp&#x2F;realpage-complaint-f...Paragraph 7 reply svnt 9 hours agorootparent“As one Lessor explains, while ‘we are all technically competitors’ RealPage ‘helps us work together’”“RealPage explains that for its services to be most effective in increasing rents, Lessors must accept the pricing at least 80 percent of the time”Yeah this is collusion. reply jlarocco 8 hours agorootparent\"Collusion as a service.\"The clients have plausible deniability because how can they know if everybody else is using it, and the service provider is \"just a recommendation\", so they&#x27;re not guilty either.If it&#x27;s not ruled illegal (and it should be) then it seems like a great business model to copy in other markets. reply DannyBee 8 hours agorootparentOne piece of confusion here is that you do not actually have to prove a literal explicit agreement between the parties to be successful.While tacit collusion is not itself illegal, conspiracy is.Put another way:You can prohibit folks from agreeing not to compete, no matter what form that agreement takes. You don&#x27;t have to know who you are avoiding competition with, etcHowever you can&#x27;t order people to compete just because they aren&#x27;t reply bsder 1 hour agorootparentprev> \"Collusion as a service.\"This has become a general problem with outsourcing and we really need to update the law on this.Big hotel chains outsource their housekeeping--the chain doesn&#x27;t pay under minimum wage--it just bids out the contract so the contractor can&#x27;t possibly win the bid without paying under minimum wage.The law needs to be updated so that fines and punishments against a subcontractor also need to be enforceable against the parent, as well. reply svnt 8 hours agorootparentprevThey know that it works by competitors “working together”, it doesn’t matter whether they communicate via language or through prices combined with a service that both explains how it works and dictates how they all behave. reply anigbrowl 7 hours agorootparentprev&#x27;People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.&#x27; reply s1artibartfast 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve read the complaint before. Nowhere does it say that users are penalized for not following the model.Keep in mind that this is a document written by the prosecution and completely one-sided. Paragraph 7 says \"RealPage explains that for its services to be most effective in increasing rents, Lessors must accept the pricing at least eighty percent of the time“That is very different than what the poster above me claimed. Nobody has kicked out of the service for not following recommendations. The closest thing to a penalty that the document can come up with is that real page will call people and inquire why they aren&#x27;t following the recommendations reply ethanbond 8 hours agorootparentSure, I edited the above comment. Fortunately punishment for not colluding is not actually a necessary feature of cartels, only the collusion is. Which this obviously is. reply twoodfin 9 hours agorootparentprevThey claimed 80% was the level needed to see effectiveness. That’s not the same thing as “requiring” anything of their customers. reply packetlost 8 hours agorootparentEffectiveness of what? Price fixing? reply twoodfin 8 hours agorootparentI don’t know. But the claim that the commercial agreement with RealPage was contingent on accepting its recommendations 80% of the time is false. reply ethanbond 8 hours agorootparentI edited the comment above, but as mentioned: the thing they&#x27;re requesting 80% coordination to accomplish is indeed price fixing, ergo cartel. replys1artibartfast 9 hours agoparentprevI think part of the case is a slam dunk. RealPage offers multiple services.One where RealPage gives you a recommended price and you are free to choose whatever price you want. They might ask you something along the lines of \"why didnt you use our price?\", but nothing is binding. This is like kelly blue book or a price consultant for apartments.The other is the AutoPilot feature, where RealPage \"takes the wheel\" and set&#x2F;publishes the listing price for you based on their model. The property owner is out of the loop, and RealPage is a single entity setting all of the prices for the subscribers.I think the first case is pretty clearly legal, and the second has some valid concerns.The point of both services is to help landlords maximize profit, but that isnt illegal by itself. reply AlphaSite 8 hours agorootparentI dont think it’s quite blue book, because it’s personalised to that property, right? It’s probably the personalisation that really differentiates it and I suspect it’s models are also design to show maximum value rather than average price, so they move the market, rather than just reporting on it. reply sinistersnare 9 hours agoparentprevI believe that the matter of their defense is irrelevant. The truth is that real people were harmed by this, and they deserve reparations today. As to who pays, it must be the landlords. This is the supposed &#x27;risk&#x27; they take on by being landlords, which everyone tells me is so great to bear.Also to get on a soap-box, this is the truth of reparations, it is not in relation to a single event, it is an attempt to solve injustices that exist institutionally in our world today. reply racketcon2089 9 hours agorootparentThis approach is at odds with rule of law and historically has not redressed injustices but rather created societies where power is even more concentrated and even less accountable.The primary purpose of any and all reparations rhetoric in the US today is to divide the electorate by anything other than economic position in order to maintain a status quo whose legitimacy is beginning to erode. And it&#x27;s working quite well, since you&#x27;re delivering grandiose proclamations while advocating for nihilism and ignorance towards the existing legal processes that will actually impact the lives of millions of people in the coming years. reply anigbrowl 7 hours agorootparentdivide the electorate by anything other than economic positionPunishing landlords for colluding against tenants by forcing them to give back the money is pretty much the opposite of the status quo and about as focused on pure economics as you can get. reply racketcon2089 6 hours agorootparentI would disagree in very strong terms. The entire economic, legal, and taxation system of the US are organized in a certain way that&#x27;s only a couple of hundred years old.Returning some money to some tenants as a one-off and restricting some forms of landlord collusion is about as far as you can get from pure economics or structural reform. Both capital R reparations and reparations as a social justice hobby horse are ultimately intended to preserve and legitimize the existing system, even in their maximalist demands which tend to deflect and discredit more concrete advocacy.Economics is a vast field with a long history and many possible futures so it&#x27;s quite sad that the horizon for many people is \"american neoliberalism with more regulation and redistribution\" or \"american neoliberalism with less regulation and redistribution.\"I can think of at least three actual opposites of the status quo: one would be a georgist tax that makes holding land speculatively unprofitable, one would be a singapore style nationalization where the government purchases all of the apartment buildings at their tax-assessed rate but allows for a market in 99 year leases, and still a third would be ex post facto arbitrary expropriation without compensation in the style of many communist revolutions.\"Some landlords return .01% to 15% of their last 2-3 years of passive revenue increases and promise to raise rents more arbitrarily\" is not a bad thing for those renters, but in terms of economic trends and policy it&#x27;s quite literally using existing law to _return_ to the status quo. reply sinistersnare 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree that contemporary rhetoric on reparations is quite poor. But, scholars today agree that reparations are a way of understanding our government&#x27;s position on change and not on giving money to people (Reconsidering Reparations by Olufemi Taiwo is about this). You give some good stuff to think about with the historical point, but I still believe it must be tried again, and better this time.So I don&#x27;t discount the legal processes, I am saying they must be changed. That is how we can actually solve issues like this, instead of simply putting a band-aid on each time we have systemic issues like this.I find myself to be an anti-nihilist as a matter of fact. Reparations is not an _ideal_ for which I have grounded in nothingness (nihilism). Reparations must be a state of being for our government, whose material being should be solving injustice and not propagating it. reply gosub100 7 hours agorootparent> scholars today agreescholars today aren&#x27;t permitted to disagree. If they do, they get cancelled. reply sinistersnare 7 hours agorootparentFunny enough, Olufemi also writes a book on this! reply mattmaroon 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is a good example of why most people don’t belong in politics or management.You’re basically saying that because this violates your code of ethics, it should be punished by the legal system wherever or not they’ve actually broken a law. So the system of laws is meaningless, what’s important is how you feel, and your moral code.And I get it, we probably all feel this way on some level. But I’m glad society doesn’t operate that way. reply sinistersnare 8 hours agorootparentToday, we punish people by taking away their money. Taking away someones money should not doom people to poverty over this kind of stuff! I am not saying kill all landlords here. I am saying that the landlords profited too much and it must be made fair.There should be no &#x27;punishment&#x27; of the landlords truly, I am saying we make a system where landlords can not unjustly profit from us (and I do speak generally here).Stuff like this is what causes the housing crisis, it must be dealt with systemically, not by giving a few people none-the-wiser a lesser life. reply arcticbull 8 hours agorootparent> I am saying that the landlords profited too much and it must be made fair.There&#x27;s for better or worse no law against &#x27;too much profit&#x27; in the general case. How would one define &#x27;too much&#x27;? A certain margin? That has historically led to merchants increasing their costs so they can profit more in absolute terms once the relative profit cap is met.Seems like the answer is just to allow more construction and densification, which in turn creates a more competitive market for housing. If they then tried to aggregate, roll-up and collude they would fall under the Sherman act no? reply sinistersnare 8 hours agorootparentWell the problem is that with these software systems, we have already answered your question.

Playing moneyball (i.e. charging the maximum the market will bear without a serious, violent response) with a necessity like rent should be illegal, and many of these tools seem designed to do that using market power, which is explicitly illegal.

Being a landlord is a job (so I&#x27;m told), do some math, figure out how much is fair (cost:labor calculation) then ask on the open market if people want to pay that. The problem is that the underlying system here did NOT do this calculation, hence price-gouging.

Why let units sit empty? reply _AzMoo 7 hours agorootparentThe argument here (not saying I agree with it) is that it&#x27;s common to let units sit empty over particular periods, based on other business decisions and an understanding of the market.eg, If you have a lease that ends in September, the make ready process takes 2-4 weeks, so the unit will be available for lease again in October. There&#x27;s not a high churn of residents in October-December due to holiday periods, etc. and demand doesn&#x27;t pick up again until January. Therefore, it&#x27;s better for you to let that unit sit empty now, because demand is so much lower for the next 2-3 months you won&#x27;t be able to get the same increase in lease price as you will when demand skyrockets in January.Another example is an understanding that some kind of amenity will change over a period. eg, a new public transport route is going in, or the property next door is being rezoned and demolished, from an industrial site to a commercial precinct, and so waiting for that to happen means that you can get a higher price on your lease once that happens, to the extent that it will offset the loss from leaving the unit vacant.The defendants will argue that the analysis provided by the plaintiff doesn&#x27;t consider these kinds of business decisions and that this part of the argument should be considered flawed. reply HDThoreaun 7 hours agorootparentprevVacancy rates nationwide are near all time lows.

In financial cases where there is actual price fixing going on (e.g. LIBOR) there has been a lot of prosecution. reply renewiltord 8 hours agorootparentprevNo, because it&#x27;s decentralized. The Price Advisor LLC is sort of important there.e.g. take a cartel that you genuinely think is a cartel. Now instead of them all colluding, imagine that they set up Price Advisor LLC, and that no two of them ever talk to each other to set prices. All price setting is done by Price Advisor LLC. Moving the price setting into this LLC does not make the operation not a cartel. The LLC saying it&#x27;s \"checking comparables\" does not make it not a cartel. After all, if a legitimate cartel could dodge this by just making a new LLC, then it would almost always make sense to cartelize because you can always act as a cartel without being considered a cartel for the cost of $500. reply fallingknife 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not easy because it would never work.

This will shift tenants into the desired renewal period within a few years and you&#x27;ll benefit even if they switch buildings in the long run, as long as most other buildings are doing this too.* Add very strong penalties for lease-breaking, including such tactics as charging as much as 135% of the monthly rate for every month remaining on the lease. Unless they re-rent the building, and then the fee is 135% - whatever they get for rent for that period (hint: want a cheap apartment for your employees? Use the lease breaker apartment and charge them the difference!)* Add the same 135% increase for the post-lease month-to-month period to force any renewals to make their decision quickly during that renewal period.Get enough major players to do the same in the same area, and you have:* Artificially increased demand during that designated 2 month period when everyone in the area renews.* Artificially constricted supply during the same period, as renters won&#x27;t release their current place until they&#x27;ve found a new one.* Ensured that any newcomers to the area will get locked into the same renewal cycle within a few years at the most.Even if they leave your complex, as long as you&#x27;ve shifted their renewal cycle you will benefit in the long term. There&#x27;s one less apartment available for rent and one more apartment seeker looking for a place during the same period that most others are looking.This is one of the major causes of housing inflation. Also, homelessness as people get priced out of the housing market.A lot of other things go into the reasons we&#x27;re seeing 5-10%+&#x2F;year rent increases when the population only increases 0.5%.

    "title": "Transitioning to Bare-Metal Saves Company $230k Annually",
    "originLink": "https://blog.oneuptime.com/moving-from-aws-to-bare-metal/",
    "originBody": "By Neel Patel — Oct 30, 2023 How moving from AWS to Bare-Metal saved us 230,000$ /yr. In the ever-evolving world of technology, businesses are constantly looking for ways to optimize their operations and reduce costs. One such journey we embarked on was moving our infrastructure from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to a bare-metal solution. This transition not only provided us with more control over our resources but also resulted in substantial financial savings. While the cost savings and technological benefits were significant factors in our decision to move from AWS to a bare-metal solution, there was another crucial reason behind this transition. Most of our customers are on the public cloud, and part of our service involves notifying them when the public cloud goes down. To ensure we can provide this service reliably and independently of the public cloud’s status, we needed to be on our own dedicated data center. By moving to a bare-metal solution in a colocation facility, we’ve been able to achieve this independence. This move has not only resulted in substantial cost savings but also enhanced our service reliability and customer communication, further demonstrating the multifaceted benefits of considering alternative infrastructure solutions. Our Initial Setup: Kubernetes on AWS In the early stages of our technological journey, we adopted a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing their managed Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) offering. OneUptime, our open-source observability platform is built on a robust foundation of open-source software such as Redis, Postgres, Clickhouse, Docker, NodeJS, and BullMQ. Interestingly, none of these technologies are AWS-specific. This choice was intentional and strategic. Our goal was to avoid reliance on AWS or any proprietary cloud technology. The reason? We wanted to empower our customers with the ability to self-host OneUptime on their own clusters. This approach not only aligns with our commitment to open-source but also provides our customers with greater control and flexibility. For those interested in self-hosting OneUptime, the Helm chart is readily available on Artifact Hub here. While AWS offered us flexibility and scalability, we began to realize that these benefits could be achieved elsewhere and at a fraction of the cost. This realization sparked a shift in our approach and led us to explore more cost-effective yet equally efficient alternatives. The Transition: Moving to Bare-Metal In our continuous pursuit of technological excellence, we recently made the strategic decision to transition to a bare-metal solution. Our choice was to run a Microk8s cluster in a colocation facility, a decision driven by our past experiences and future aspirations. Historically, we’ve always maintained an internal self-hosted test cluster on Microk8s. This hands-on experience with a Kubernetes flavor not only enriched our understanding but also bolstered our confidence in setting up a production-ready cluster. There’s a common misconception that Microk8s is solely for edge computing or development purposes. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, numerous companies, including ours, are now leveraging Microk8s in production environments. This shift is testament to the robustness and versatility of Microk8s, proving it to be a viable option for diverse use-cases. Transitioning to bare-metal servers has provided us with dedicated resources, effectively eliminating the ‘noisy neighbor’ issue often experienced in shared hosting environments like AWS. This issue arises when multiple customers share the same server resources, leading to performance degradation if one customer hogs more than their fair share of resources. Now, we have complete control over our hardware. This autonomy allows us to fine-tune our servers to meet our specific needs, optimizing performance and efficiency. We can customize every aspect of our infrastructure, from the operating system and network architecture to the type and amount of storage used. The Role of Kubernetes and Helm in Our Transition Technologies like Kubernetes and Helm have played a significant role in our transition from the cloud to our own servers. Kubernetes, an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers, has made it easier for us to manage our applications on our own servers. Helm, on the other hand, is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the process of defining, installing, and upgrading complex Kubernetes applications. It’s like a homebrew for Kubernetes; it packages up applications into charts (collections of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources) that can be deployed onto your cluster. These technologies have made it incredibly easy to ‘de-cloud’ and move to our own servers. They’ve provided us with the flexibility and control we needed while ensuring that the transition was smooth and efficient. Storage and LoadBalancers Most people are confused on how are volumes provisioned and how are load balancers provisioned on a bare metal kubernets cluster, We use Network File System (NFS) for volumes. NFS is a distributed file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. Microk8s makes it incredibly easy to implement NFS storage, which has been a significant advantage for us. You can check their docs here on how to configure one: https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-nfs For managing publicly facing services, we use MetalLB. MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols. Microk8s offers a plugin that simplifies the process of integrating MetalLB into our setup. You can check the docs here: https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-metallb We will do a blog post soon to explain how to configure these if you're thinking about de-clouding yourself. The Financial Impact: Saving $230,000+ per Year Before Migration When we were utilizing AWS, our setup consisted of a 28-node managed Kubernetes cluster. Each of these nodes was an m7a EC2 instance. With block storage and network fees included, our monthly bills amounted to $38,000+. This brought our annual expenditure to over $456,000+. After Migration We transitioned to using a single rack configuration at our co-location partner, providing us with 40 rack units of usable space. With each server being 2U - we could potentially rack about 18 of them (other U's are usually for networking equipment). Each of our servers are upgradeable to over 1 TB of RAM and has 2 socket 128 core CPU with about 80 TB usable of storage in our storage cluster. The financial implications of this move were significant. We allocated and invested $150,000 in new servers for our bare-metal setup. While this might appear as a substantial upfront cost, the long-term savings have been nothing short of remarkable. Our monthly operational expenditure (op-ex), which includes power, cooling, energy, and remote hands (although we seldom use this service), is now approximately $5,500. When compared to our previous AWS costs, we’re saving over $230,000 roughly per year if you amortize the cap-ex costs of the server over 5 years. This substantial reduction in expenses has enabled us to allocate resources to other critical areas of our business and has facilitated the hiring of more engineers. Thats over 55% in savings for better compute! Things to Consider Backups: We back up all of our data multiple times a day to a storage server located at two of our offices - one in Boston, US, and the other in London, UK. You can also do this to a public cloud. We think its easier and cheaper to do it on-prem. Multi Location Cluster: You could also run a multi-location kubernetes cluster on two different co-location facility with 2 different co-location partners in 2 different continents for higher redundancy. You could potentally do this by creating a VPN between these two locations. Backup Cluster: We have a ready to go backup cluster on AWS that can spin up in under 10 minutes if something were to happen to our co-location facility. Helm charts + k8s make it really easy to spin these up. We still use AWS in disaster scenarios and haven't closed our AWS account just yet! Server Admins: When planning a transition to bare metal, many believe that hiring server administrators is a necessity. While their role is undeniably important, it’s worth noting that a substantial part of hardware maintenance is actually managed by the colocation facility. In the context of AWS, the expenses associated with employing AWS administrators often exceed those of Linux on-premises server administrators. This represents an additional cost-saving benefit when shifting to bare metal. With today’s servers being both efficient and reliable, the need for “management” has significantly decreased. Use of Microk8s: There is a common misconception that Microk8s is only for edge computing or development purposes. However, this is not true at all. Microk8s is a small, fast, and single-package Kubernetes distribution that can run on any platform. Many companies, including ours, are using Microk8s in production environments and the official documentation supports this use case. We have been very satisfied with Microk8s so far, but we are also flexible to change to another Kubernetes distribution if needed. The beauty of Kubernetes is that it is portable, extensible, and open source, so switching flavors is easy. We chose Kubernetes because it is the best platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Conclusion Our transition from AWS to bare-metal infrastructure underscores the fact that while cloud services such as AWS offer robust flexibility and power, they may not always be the most economical choice for every enterprise. By harnessing the power of open-source technologies and investing in our own hardware, we’ve not only gained greater control over our resources but also realized substantial savings in operational costs. It’s important to remember that each business has its own unique needs. What proved successful for us may not necessarily yield the same results for everyone. Therefore, conducting a comprehensive evaluation of your specific requirements is crucial before undertaking such a transition. Thanks to advancements in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Microk8s, and more, transitioning to bare-metal infrastructure is now significantly easier than it was just a few years ago.

AWS, even when using barebonea EC2 instances, actually means on-demand provisioning of computational resources with the help of infrastructure-as-code services. A random developer logs into his AWS console, clicks a few buttons, and he&#x27;s already running a fully instrumented service with logging and metrics a click away. He can click another button and delete&#x2F;shut down everything. He can click on a button again and deploy the same application in multiple continents with static files provided through a global CDN, deployed with a dedicated pipeline. He clicks on another button again and everything is shut down again.How do you pull that off with \"Linux on-premises server administrators\"? You don&#x27;t.At most, you can get your Linux server administrators to manage their hardware with something like OpenStack, but they would be playing the role of the AWS engineers that your \"AWS administrators\" don&#x27;t even know exist. However, anyone who works with AWS only works on the abstraction layers above that which a \"Linux on premises administrator\" works on. reply baz00 11 hours agorootparentThis is the voice of someone who has never actually ended up with a big AWS estate.You don&#x27;t click to start and stop.

I have worked for a global corporation that you have almost certainly heard of. Though it&#x27;s not super sexy.The parent you&#x27;re replying to resonates with me. A lot of politics about how you spend and how you commit, it&#x27;s almost as bad as the commitment terms for bare-metal providers (3,6,12,24month commits). Except the base-load is more expensive.It depends a lot on your load, but for my workloads (which, is fragile dumb but very vertical compute with a wide geographic dispersion), the cost is so high that a few dozen thousand has been missed numerous times, despite having in-house \"fin-ops\" folks casting their gaze upon our spend. reply baz00 9 hours agorootparentprevHey me too. reply ricardobeat 1 hour agorootparentprev> A random developer logs into his AWS console, clicks a few buttons, and he&#x27;s already running a fully instrumented service with logging and metrics a click awayIn a dream. In the real world of medium-to-large enterprise, a developer opens a ticket or uses some custom-built tool to bootstrap a new service, after writing a design doc and maybe going through a security review. They wait for the necessary approvals while they prepare the internal observability tools, and find out that there is an ongoing migration and their stack is not fully supported yet. In the meantime, he needs permissions to edit the Terraform files to update routing rules and actually send traffic to their service. At no point he does, or ever will, have direct access to the AWS console. The tools mentioned are the full-time job of dozens of other engineers (and PMs, EMs and managers).

Someone needs to be completely clueless to the realities of both job roles to assume they deliver the same value.

With the exact same budget, how do you pull off a multi-region deployment with an on-premises setup managed by your on-premises linux admins? And even if your goal is providing a single deployment, how flexible are you to put up this scheme to test a prototype and afterwards shut down the service? ygjb 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that&#x27;s part of it. The other part is that you can move stuff that is working, and working well, into on-prem (or colo) if it is designed well and portable. If everything is running in containers, and orchestration is already configured, and you aren&#x27;t using AWS or cloud provider specific features, portability is not super painful (modulo the complexity of your app, and the volume of data you need to migrate). Clearly this team did the assessment, and the savings they achieved by moving to on-prem was worthwhile.That doesn&#x27;t preclude continuing to use AWS and other cloud service as a click-ops driven platform for experimentation, and requiring that anything that is targeting production to refactored to run in the bare-metal environment. At least two shops I worked at previously have used that as a recurring model (one focusing on AWS, the other on GCP) for stuff that was in prototyping or development. reply scarface_74 9 hours agorootparent> Yeah, that&#x27;s part of it. The other part is that you can move stuff that is working, and working well, into on-prem (or colo) if it is designed well and portable. If everything is running in containersAnyone who says that hasn’t done it at scale.“Infrastructure has weight”. Dependencies always creep in and any large scale migration involves regression testing, security, dealing with the PMO, compliance, dealing with outside vendors who may have white listed certain IP addresses, training, vendor negotiations, data migrations etc.And then even though you use MySQL for instance, someone somewhere decided to do a “load data into S3” AWS MySQL extension and now they are going to have to write an ETL job. Someone else decided to store and serve static web assets to S3. reply icedchai 9 hours agorootparentprevMost folks aren&#x27;t focused on portability. Almost every custom built AWS app I&#x27;ve seen is using AWS-specific managed services, coded to S3, SQS, DynamoDB, etc. It&#x27;s very convenient and productive to use those services. If you&#x27;re just hosting VMs on EC2, what&#x27;s the point? reply rewmie 10 hours agorootparentprev> Yeah, that&#x27;s part of it. The other part is that you can move stuff that is working, and working well, into on-prem (or colo) if it is designed well and portable.That&#x27;s part of the apples-and-oranges problem I mentioned.It&#x27;s perfectly fine if a company decides to save up massive amounts of cash by running stable core services on-premises instead of paying small fortunes to a cloud provider for the equivalent service.Except that that&#x27;s not the value proposition of a cloud provider.A team managing on premises hardware barely covers a fraction of the value or flexibility provided by a cloud service. That team of Linux sysadmins does not nor will it ever provide the level of flexibility nor cover the range of services that a single person with access to a AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure account provides. It&#x27;s like claiming that buying your own screwdriver is far better than renting a whole workshop. Sure, you have a point if all you plan on doing is tightening that screw. Except you don&#x27;t pay for a workshop to tighten up screws, and instead you use it to iterate over designs for your screws before you even know how much load it&#x27;s expected to take. reply sgarland 9 hours agorootparentCounterpoint: most shops do not need most of the bespoke cloud services they&#x27;re using. If you actually do, you should know (or have someone on staff who knows) how to operate it, which negates most of the point of renting it from a cloud provider.If you _actually need_ Kafka, for example – not just any messaging system – then your scale is such that you better know how to monitor it, tune it, and fix it when it breaks. If you can do that, then what&#x27;s the difference from running it yourself?

These stories are always bs blog spam by companies trying to pretend they pulled off some amazing new hack. In reality they were burning cash because they hadn&#x27;t the faintest idea how to control their spend. When we were utilizing AWS, our setup consisted of a 28-node managed Kubernetes cluster. Each of these nodes was an m7a EC2 instance. With block storage and network fees included, our monthly bills amounted to $38,000+The hell were you doing with 28 nodes to run an uptime tracking app? Did you try just running it on like, 3 nodes, without K8s? When compared to our previous AWS costs, we’re saving over $230,000 roughly per year if you amortize the cap-ex costs of the server over 5 years.Compared to a 5-year AWS savings plan? Probably not.On top of this, they somehow advertise using K8s as a simplification? Let&#x27;s reign in our spend, not only by abandoning the convenience of VMs and having to do more maintenance, but let&#x27;s require customers use a minimum of 3 nodes and a dozen services to run a dinky uptime tracking app.This meme must be repeating itself due to ignorance. The CIOs&#x2F;CTOs have no clue how to control spend in the cloud, so they rake up huge bills and ignore it \"because we&#x27;re trying to grow quickly!\" Then maybe they hire someone who knows the Cloud, but they tell them to ignore the cost too. Finally they run out of cash because they weren&#x27;t watching the billing, so they do the only thing they are technically competent enough to do: set up some computers and install Linux, and write off the cost as cap-ex.

Did you try just running it on like, 3 nodes, without K8s?I&#x27;ve seen this before.It happens when the people who manage the infrastructure are completely decoupled from the developers. The developers determine how much CPU &#x2F; memory is \"needed\" for a given workload, and the infra team just adds it. Developers aren&#x27;t responsible for infra costs. Infra team has limited ability to control costs.Add a few years and teams with their own container-based applications, Kafka, Elasticsearch, multi-instance Postgres, etc., and soon enough, it&#x27;s a 28 node cluster and costs are out of control. Infra team can only do so much, and devs aren&#x27;t incentivized to help, either. Everyone&#x27;s shrugging their shoulders because now it&#x27;ll take significant refactoring and cross-silo work to actually fix.If they told us what was running on those 28 nodes, we&#x27;d point that out immediately.

    "originBody": "Digital Markets Act — No Bing, no Edge, no upselling: De-crufted Windows 11 coming to Europe soon Some changes will arrive for non-EU users, too, but not the easy removals. Kevin Purdy - 11/16/2023, 8:39 PM Enlarge / Users in the extended European Economic Area will soon be able to avoid most of the things that feel so exhausting about Windows 11. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 83 with Using Windows these days means putting up with many, many pitches to use and purchase other Microsoft products. Some are subtle, like the built-in Edge browser suggesting you use its \"recommended settings\" after each major update. Some are not so subtle, like testing a \"quiz\" that made some users explain why they're trying to quit the OneDrive app. Those living in the European Economic Area (EEA)—which includes the EU and adds Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway—will soon get the volume turned down on their Windows 11 systems. To meet the demands of the European Commission's Digital Markets Act—slated to be enforced in March 2024—Microsoft must make its apps easier to uninstall, its default settings easier to change, and its attempts at steering people toward its services easier to avoid. Microsoft writes in a blog post that many of these changes will be available in a preview update of Windows 11 (version 23H2) this month. Windows 10 will get similar changes \"at a later date.\" A couple of changes affect all Windows 10 and 11 users: Apps that are critical to Windows will be labeled with a \"System\" tag in Settings, the Start menu, and search results Camera, Cortana, and Photos can now be uninstalled Advertisement In the EEA, much more is on the way: Bing's web search from the Start menu and the Edge browser can be uninstalled Third parties can add to the Windows Widgets Board feeds Third parties, like Google or DuckDuckGo, can provide the built-in web search results that Bing once had exclusively Windows users who choose to sync their Microsoft accounts will have their pinned apps and preferences synced, seemingly keeping their EEA-enabled choices Windows will now \"always use customers' configured app default settings for link and file types\" Microsoft's post notes that Windows uses the region picked during Windows install to offer the EEA-exclusive options. Only a PC reset can undo the options. EEA Windows devices will also not get the Microsoft Copilot preview that is rolling out in other markets. The Digital Markets Act's impending arrival will impact other major tech firms that are considered \"gatekeepers\" providing \"core platform services\" that are \"most prone to unfair business practices.\" Google has recently pitched the European Union on the idea of forcing Apple to make iMessage interoperable under the Act. Apple has reportedly worked on changes to iOS that would allow \"sideloading\" apps outside Apple's own App Store, while another provision in the Digital Markets Act would demand developers be able to use their preferred payments systems. A companion piece of legislation focused on online platforms, the Digital Services Act, will impact 19 platforms, including five Google services, Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, and Microsoft's Bing search engine. On Wednesday, Meta became the first platform to appeal its gatekeeper status for its Messenger and Marketplace services, followed shortly thereafter by TikTok. reader comments 83 with Kevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a variety of technology topics and reviewing products.

Not in the browser, not in some kind of \"News\" app, but right in my taskbar! The most amazing part is that I did not even have to click on it – the system carefully opened it for me to delight me with some low-quality not-even-local news. I was not astonished then to see it resisting the Chrome browser download - something I had seen and laughed at many years before. What also caught my eye so much is the amount of branding around – there are Spotify, TikTok, Amazon Prime, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger icons right in your menu bar before you ever need them or attempt to download and discover these apps for yourself. I mean that is too much. It feels like you don&#x27;t really own this system but use it in some kind of public library. reply pavlov 1 hour agoparent> \"the system carefully opened it for me to delight me with some low-quality not-even-local news\"To be fair, Apple does this exact same thing on their operating system. On a freshly installed iPhone, swipe right at the home screen. It takes you to the widget screen which is loaded by default with Apple News showing random junk.Microsoft deserves the flak for turning Windows 11 into a billboard, but Apple isn&#x27;t immune to this either. reply beowulfey 5 minutes agorootparentWhile Apple is far from perfect, the difference in extent between the two is pretty dramatic. I switched back to MacOS from Windows this year because Windows 11 was annoying me to no end. Microsoft has gone much farther down the anti-user experience road. reply lynx23 42 minutes agorootparentprevThis is only true if you are in a country which is supported by Apple News. Mine isn&#x27;t. reply hurril 1 hour agorootparentprevBut they don&#x27;t do the exact same thing at all. One comes preloaded with apps you didn&#x27;t choose and news or ads right on the task bar. Apple does none of that. reply heavyset_go 17 minutes agorootparentBy default, Apple loads up the news widget in the macOS notification area.Clicking on a story opens it in the Apple News app, which is also in your dock by default. reply hurril 9 minutes agorootparentDo you want me to understand a news app or widget as the same thing as unwarranted ads in the start menu? reply heavyset_go 2 minutes agorootparentHere&#x27;s what the OP described as happening on their new Windows install:> I remember the first time I used a Windows system last year after tens of years on Linux&#x2F;OSX, and it was really a somewhat strange experience: the moment I connected the ethernet cable I was instantly looking at random flashy news articles from another part of the world.

They show news and other unsolicited content practically in the home screen (the widget screen is just a swipe away, every user will stumble there). What&#x27;s the difference?I think people are a bit blind to Apple&#x27;s defaults. They compare a fresh Windows 11 install to their own customized iOS install with a decade of history, and conclude that Microsoft is so much worse. But the out of the box experience for a new user isn&#x27;t all that different, IMHO. (MacOS is still better than Windows in many respects, but it&#x27;s been steadily moving closer to iOS and comes with an ever-growing pile of Apple default apps loaded in the Dock and set as defaults.) reply hurril 1 hour agorootparentYes, it does come with Apple Music (and whatever Apple News it - perhaps I&#x27;ve missed it?) And they do nag about using Apple Music a lot.I dislike that they do this and Apple can be criticised for a million different things. 1) this is not it; 2) this is not what Microsoft is doing.It has filled the Dock with (all) Apple apps the last 15+ years.I don&#x27;t quite understand why you&#x27;re comparing a desktop OS to the phone OS, but I guess that can make some sense? reply blackoil 31 minutes agorootparentLet&#x27;s compare apps from the article.\"Camera, Cortana&#x2F;CoPilot, and Photos can now be uninstalled\". Mac and iOS come with PhotoBooth&#x2F;Camera, Siri and Photos preinstalled, I don&#x27;t think can be removed.\"No Bing, no Edge, no upselling.\" You can&#x27;t remove Safari, comes with upselling to Apple drive.Apple also comes preinstalled with Maps, Music, BookReader, NewsClient, MailClient, TV app, Notes app. For all I have better alternatives so tonnes of bloat and at worse many of them can&#x27;t be completely disabled. They keep popping at some unexpected places.For that matter popular linux distros come with similar apps, though through some maze in installer you may have been able to skip them. reply dijit 10 minutes agorootparentWe’re talking passed each other, because the parent is complaining that “random third party ads” are in the task bar, nothing to do with Microsoft and not relevant to the context they’re in.Apple News could be criticized for having a default list of news sources and I think that’s fair. But the news app is first party. Apple Music could be criticized for its upselling, and that’s justified as heck, but it’s still first party.However; Safari and edge aren’t comparable. Safari seems to be perfectly content in being relegated to storage, never to hit memory or the CPU again, and I believe it is possible to remove it. Edge begs for its life when you even consider installing an alternative browser.That’s not the topic being discussed in this branch of the thread as far as I understood it, but even if you were to take that point it’s a very large difference. reply surgical_fire 13 minutes agorootparentprevIt absolutely is the same thing Microsoft does, just with different branding. In fact, Apple was doing it before MS. If anything, MS is just copying Apple there.The only difference is that they have been doing it for 15+ years and during this time they convinced you that it is okay that they do it on a pocket computer, as if it was somehow magically different. reply hurril 1 minute agorootparentThen we don&#x27;t understand the phrase \"the same thing\" the same way.An Apple box comes with Apple software and services. It does not come with third party apps preinstalled and it does not show me ads. The one exception that I can think of is in the App Store and in their TV offer, but this is not what you are talking about.I disagree with a thousand things that Apple does but this comparison is disingenuous.gloosx 1 hour agorootparentprevNot that I like the way Apple does business, but these days, phones are really used for distraction. So, it is a bit more logical to put a news aggregator there. At least you have to swipe right, and it is not doing it for you. At least it is not pushing this widget down your throat. And there&#x27;s nothing like that on the desktop system. When you first launch and go through some onboarding wizards, it just stands amazingly still and chill. No single pixel of the interface is moving away or appearing in front of your face out of nowhere without your interaction reply haspok 1 hour agoparentprevThe really shocking part of this is that people actually pay money for this experience.

Most governments serve the interests of local industries more than they should, and Silicon Valley is quite obviously not in the EU.

That would work equally well everywhere. reply throwaway2037 1 hour agorootparentprevIn the EU, really? I can see it in the US, but the amount of lobbying spend in EU must be 1-2 orders of magnitude less.Also, all highly advanced democracies have some lobbying.

While as an Indian I&#x27;m ashamed of the level of corruption we have in every government system of ours, at least it&#x27;s still called corruption (and is illegal) what US calls lobbying (and is legal). reply zealotsm 8 minutes agorootparentSadly, electoral bonds make this less true.

However I do not think the EU is as easily swayed, especially as EU regulators are generally skeptical of the business practices of large US multinationals. IMO, and possibly objectively, the EU is generally more pro-competition and pro-privacy, it is also much harder to buy out politicians due to the parties being really fragmented and it would appear more difficult to unilaterally impose the will of these corps on their citizens. reply danieldk 3 hours agorootparentespecially as EU regulators are generally skeptical of the business practices of large US multinationalsThe singling out of US multinationals is a bit of a myth, it&#x27;s just more visible to us tech people and since the revenues are larger, the fines also tend to be larger.

Most programs assume they are always present, so the error messages they give are cryptic and the average user won&#x27;t guess the problem lies in their Windows having been N(eutered). What&#x27;s worse, Microsoft website provides several guides that explain how to install the codecs, and they all contradict each other. I think https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;media-feature-pa... is the correct link, but I might be mistaken.And of course Microsoft bundles a lot of additional programs like Groove Music and Skype with the codecs in a single pack. reply tambre 50 minutes agorootparentThe fact that made me switch away from the N edition was the fact that the separately installable media codecs weren&#x27;t available for weeks after my computer auto-updated to a new major Windows release. This basically made my computer unusable for many regular tasks I did, since as you noted most programs assume they&#x27;re available. reply mike_d 29 minutes agorootparentprevI thought I would be clever and install the N edition of Windows 11, took me nearly two weeks to figure out what extra bits needed to be installed to allow a webcam to work. reply soco 1 hour agorootparentprevOnly when I started programming lambdas I realized how life-saving resource tests and error messages really are.

Motivation for asking: Several built-in apps are listed in the Apps section of the settings as having just a few kB in size, which does not match how bloated in size apps typically are in the current times. I&#x27;ve seen mouse drivers occupy hundreds of MB. My guess is that the apps are much bigger than those kB values and the installed Apps settings section is set to let users believe otherwise. reply alkonaut 27 minutes agoparentI think for app uninstallation to be relevant it&#x27;s not whether the app resides on disk that&#x27;s important, it&#x27;s whether it&#x27;s interfering with how you use the system. E.g. for a browser it&#x27;s just important that the browser isn&#x27;t registered as the default browser everywhere, but you can install your own browser. Being able to \"uninstall\" an app in a relevant way means being able to make it appear as if you don&#x27;t have it. Whether or not the files the app uses are still on disk is perhaps relevant for disk space, but from a legal standpoint that seems almost irrelevant. reply hurryer 36 minutes agoparentprevSome Windows binaries are hard linked to run directly from the installation disk image copied during Windows install .Those few kb are probably the size of the hard links to the image. reply walteweiss 42 minutes agoparentprevAs with my iPhone that has none of Voice Memos at the moment has data shown as 4 GB.

Cookie banners are a form of malicious compliance. When you complain about them, you are doing the lobbying work of ad companies for free. The correct solution is to just not spy on people, and the problem is that the EU didn&#x27;t go far enough and just ban the behavior altogether. reply zamadatix 5 hours agorootparentThe rules are really surprisingly encouraging about notification of cookies to the point it&#x27;s quite easy to legitimately need to notify and gain consent about something non-spying related requires consent. E.g. if you have a UI customization cookie which sets the results density preference and you want to store that more than a session (i.e. it should still save for a month later) then the official EU analysis of this is you must notify this is a cookie and that setting this will set this cookie.If the law didn&#x27;t intend for users to be inundated with notification banners and consent checkboxes it sure is odd how much time they spent about writing how anything but the most basic connection cookies require said things. reply mrweasel 2 hours agorootparent> E.g. if you have a UI customization cookie which sets the results density preference and you want to store that more than a sessionI&#x27;m not entirely sure that this is true. You can implement a \"shopping cart\" on your site, with a session cookie without needing to have a \"cookie notification\", so depending on circumstance I&#x27;d argue that settings might be allowed as well. Or you can just display the cookie information along with the settings it self, it doesn&#x27;t actually need to be a popup. reply handsclean 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s trivial to implement this in a legal and user friendly way, just make the save button make clear that it’ll persist, or even add a persistence checkbox. Demanding consent as an aggressive popup when it isn’t necessary for anything but ad tracking is not a good faith compliance effort, it’s an attempt to avoid real compliance by just having the user just sign off on whatever they were already doing. reply sureglymop 2 hours agorootparentAdd the cookie popup&#x2F;banner into the browser so that the user can make a choice for _all_ the websites used.

It requires you to not keep a record of all your clients&#x27; personal info without a legitimate interest.There&#x27;s a Seinfeld episode where Elaine goes to buy a fancy pen at a stationery store which isn&#x27;t available atm. The clerk asks for her full name and number to notify her (that&#x27;s a legitimate interest) but then uses it to hit on&#x2F;stalk her (that would be a GDPR violation). Presumably he also doesn&#x27;t get rid of the number after their business transaction. reply mananaysiempre 6 hours agorootparentprevNot a lawyer. My impression is that you’re in any case allowed to record things in order to fulfil explicit requests (preferences, ongoing orders—like in your example), legal requirements (limited-time order history—ugh), or functional necessities (free trial used up), no explicit consent needed. Notably the bar is “required to work at all”, not “required to be profitable” or “required to use common out-of-the-box solutions”. Cloudflare or reCAPTCHA 3 would probably make interesting test cases here (my burning hate for them from the several years I needed to use a self-hosted always-on VPN aside).The way to do this (both in ePrivacy and in GDPR, despite the different legal mechanisms they use) looks to be to write a phrase like “legitimate interest” into the main text, give illustrative examples of what that’s supposed to mean in the recitals before that, and let the courts figure out the details. reply dghlsakjg 5 hours agorootparentprevThe law says that you need consent for any cookies which aren&#x27;t strictly necessary for the functioning of the site.In your instance, I would have put a backordered hammer in my cart.

Now I barely have to mention it to people. It’s been a dramatic change in a short time span. reply TheCapeGreek 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been on linux for the better part of the last 6 years. Legitimately the only times I can recall _not_ being able to do something on Linux were a handful of use cases:- Multiplayer games: Steam Proton largely solves compatibility for a lot of games now, but the included DRM and anti-cheat for some multiplayer games made them unplayable.- Certain specialist tools like Photoshop, some CAD software, etc. Open source in this space is better in compatibility.For the rest of the time I&#x27;d do the same as you say: stick to web apps, use the mobile version, etc.I switched to Mac this year because the M1+ battery life is best-in-class for the price, and I sorely needed a cheaper solution for work than an inverter + batteries to survive South Africa&#x27;s loadshedding. That, and that some Laravel tooling is smoother on macOS than anywhere else these days. reply pipes 3 hours agorootparentI tried multiple times to use Linux as primary desktop. I gave up. Windows hardware support for consumer devices is just better. And games, especially old games.Linux is amazing , but for a everyday machine. I&#x27;ve given up on Linux, I don&#x27;t have time to configure it. Also every desktop ui Ive used on it isn&#x27;t quite as polished as windows. reply TheCapeGreek 24 minutes agorootparentI think iforgotpassword gave a good reply to this, but I wanted to add a bit.I agree it&#x27;s not for everyone day-to-day, since I feel like inevitably you have to dive into the CLI to fix things with trying to get more obscure programs working.As for desktop UI, IMO the tradeoff is that Linux DEs have no added cruft. I&#x27;d take that over Windows which to me seems filled with bloatware from MS before even the hardware manufacturer gets their hands on it. I&#x27;ve tried many DEs in my time with Linux, and I think GNOME in the last year or two is one of the best as a good mix of good visuals and highly customisable. KDE was closer to Windows but I&#x27;ve just never had luck with it being stable on various machines (seems to be surviving on my Steam Deck though).Consumer device support is better I agree, though again IMO&#x2F;IME that&#x27;s more for certain niche hardware pieces or anything that has its own control app. Bluetooth is also something that I&#x27;ve still struggled with, especially when it comes to headsets.Old games I can&#x27;t agree with you on, but maybe that depends on your definition of old. I&#x27;ve had about the same experience getting old games (say from 2000 onwards) working, either with emulation or Wine supporting old software fairly seamlessly. And things have improved too. For example when I started using Linux around 2017, I recall Wine basically couldn&#x27;t run The Sims 2 in a stable manner. Over the years since however, Lutris, Crossplay and Proton have taken the mantle and made games from that era work very nicely. reply iforgotpassword 2 hours agorootparentprevHardware is hit or miss. Had very good experience with ThinkPads.I don&#x27;t get the old games part. This is something where Linux absolutely shines, a lot of old Win9x games run perfectly fine on Wine, but fail on modern Windows for weird reasons. The biggest hurdle is usually DRM and Anti-Cheat, but I guess I&#x27;m lucky here because I don&#x27;t play any competitive multiplayer games but more casual stuff. Also I don&#x27;t use Nvidia. ;)I just switched completely about a decade ago. Don&#x27;t even remember what the final straw was. I guess what \"helped\" was that at the time I was very busy with life and really only had the most basic demands for my computing needs outside of work, so any shortcomings in areas like gaming didn&#x27;t matter. Basically needed a browser and a text editor. When things got better two or three years down the line, well, it has already been a while since I used Windows, so any shortcomings were just part of life I guess, but also I just figured more and more stuff out over the years. I guess, and that comes down to personal preference, another thing that greatly helped was that I&#x27;m just not focused on convenience and somewhat of a minimalist, so I use i3 as the window manager and no further desktop environment. I don&#x27;t use any file manager but just the terminal. No gvfs, every USB drive gets mounted and unmounted via terminal. I do use NetworkManager but only via nmcli. I guess having grown up on DOS left some impact. It just means less moving parts, so no stupid surprises after an update like \"my KDE&#x2F;gnome file manager suddenly doesn&#x27;t show any thumb drive I plug in anymore\".I don&#x27;t pretend Linux is ready for the average Joe.

Worked OOB on Linux since day one.Ditto for my other run-of-the-mill corporate hp-recommends-windows laptop&#x27;s intel iGPU: it had a tough time outputting 4k@60Hz over the hp dock. Had to do a weird dance of unplugging and replugging the monitor at just the right time to make it work. Fixed after some Windows update half a year in. 0 issues since day one on Linux. Also, on this particular machine, you better have an external mouse for installing Windows, since it doesn&#x27;t recognize the touchpad. Ditto for the integrated intel wifi card.

You can’t keep memory pages as compressed data in RAM what you can do in Mac and Windows. The out of memory behavior is also very bad on Linux, where it will just lock your system.

Your Mac on the contrary, has what is says it has. reply kalleboo 17 minutes agorootparent> swap partitionThis is the difference. Linux has a swap partition. You fill up the dedicated swap partition (which you decide when you partition your drive and is unusable for anything else, so you want to keep it small) and boom you&#x27;re out of memory, OOM starts killing random stuff.macOS uses a dynamic swap file (technically its multiple files) on your boot drive that starts at 0 bytes that grows until your main partition runs out of space.I wrote a small program to do some image processing, I had a memory leak that leaked uncompressed bitmaps, after a couple minutes browsing HN \"why is that process so slow?\", I go check, it turns out it had burned up like 200 GB of RAM on my 16 GB Mac without me even noticing. But it did actually complete without me bothering to fix the bug, so problem solved.This also means macOS has a lot more leeway to, say, swap out background tabs you haven&#x27;t touched in a week in favor of live data since it can grow that swapfile full of stale garbage. replybee_rider 4 hours agorootparentprevThere are some downsides to Linux, though.

Inconsistent behavior on double click of the title bar (Chrome maximizes and Slack doesn&#x27;t) is annoying. Lack of snapping and tiling (a la super-arrow) drives me nuts. That command-tab will switch me to a different workspace completely defeats the purpose of having a workspace at all.

I got an apple trackpad for my desk setup, and otherwise use the built in trackpad on the macbook.Doesn&#x27;t help for those who need a mouse device (cad&#x2F;design&#x2F;photo-editing, etc), but for what I use it for (software dev&#x2F;ops work), it&#x27;s great.

This works well with my tendency to not move my hand very much when mousing, but still expect the pointer to go to the other side of the screen. Plus, some of those mice have on-board memory which allows customizing their buttons without having some crappy app running in the background (Logitech G vs normal Logitech).Using a regular mouse does feel like trying to push a string through sand. reply cmcaleer 4 hours agorootparentprevGod bless the trackpad on Macbooks.

I can very easily use dead keys to create the accents. I type as quickly in French on a Mac QWERTY as I used to on a regular AZERTY (it still requires dead keys for some characters).If you use terminals, now your copy&#x2F;paste shortcuts stay the same across apps. Trying to copy something without paying attention won&#x27;t quit your running program &#x2F; return you to the end of the history.At first, I also found it a bit weird, but it has grown on me so much that now that I don&#x27;t use a mac anymore, I try to bring it with me. One of the reasons why I hate using Windows at work, is that I can&#x27;t get it to have a fully mac-like keyboard. I&#x27;m pretty close, but it insists on having the right alt as AltGr, which is a PITA, especially since it can&#x27;t be moved. On Linux, the Mac layout works perfectly, at least on X11. reply weikju 5 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a setting to enable&#x2F;disable switching to a space with an app’s window when switching to an app. That should help with one of your issues.Kb shortcuts are standard - for a Mac ;).

Note that double-clicking the titlebar works the same in stock apps, as well as in most mac-only native apps.Cross-platform apps like Slack often hide the native titlebar and draw their own which doesn’t implement all the native behaviors or even try to mimic them. Papercuts like this are part of why Mac users are more likely to be discontent with cross-platform apps.For many Electron apps a decent work around is to install them as PWAs, which can be done with both Safari (File > Add to Dock…) or your preferred Chrome-cousin. Those draw proper titlebars. reply bigstrat2003 2 hours agorootparentprevThe UI is the single biggest reason why I will never own a Mac.

AltTab is nice, but the window management still sucks in my opinion. The security bandages used to work around traditional desktop security models makes it feel incredibly annoying to use; I&#x27;ll try to set a keyboard shortcut (not a global one mind you) in iTerm2 and suddenly I need to enable iTerm2 to have accessibility access?Disabling SIP is needed for a myriad of things that aren&#x27;t really that advanced, like for example, it is needed for some reason by some of the macOS \"tiling WM\" toys, and it&#x27;s needed to even use any kexts. No joke: Discord will direct you to disable SIP if you want to .. capture audio during screenshares. It&#x27;s also needed for macFUSE.macOS also has no equivalent to WSL2. \"But it&#x27;s POSIX!\" I can hear you say. Very fair point, but there are a lot of uses for lightweight Linux VMs, like, well, testing Linux things. Docker Desktop tries but it&#x27;s slow. I really wanted to like Podman Desktop but it&#x27;s similarly slow, and I had trouble with networking in a difficult-to-debug way. I strongly recommend Orb Stack here: it basically brings the WSL2 experience to macOS, except maybe even a bit better, vastly prefer it to Docker Desktop. That said, it&#x27;s a monthly cost, which is definitely not ideal. There&#x27;s also Colima but I have to say I don&#x27;t love it either; no IPv6 support isn&#x27;t a killer but it was annoying to find out the hard way.I could probably make do with macOS if forced, but I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it. That said, I can&#x27;t really take having to deal with the rest of the Apple ecosystem, so I am stuck very deep into Linux. To be fair, this is nothing new for me: Linux has been my primary desktop OS since high school. But I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a good desktop OS. I mostly use it because I don&#x27;t really feel like I have any other options and I already paid the cost to get deep into it anyway.(I don&#x27;t hate everything about Apple obviously, but to be honest, my desire to use Apple Silicon devices was mostly tied to high hopes for Asahi Linux) reply donny2018 4 hours agorootparentAlso, pressing (x) close button doesn’t close the app. It continues hanging somewhere inside of this $1500 machine’s 8GB of RAM.That alone makes me forget all of the Windows’s quirks and appreciate all the basic things my Windows machine offers. reply jwells89 4 hours agorootparentThat’s because on Mac OS, there isn’t a 1:1 mapping of windows to processes. Instead, multiple windows of any given app are hosted by a single process which stays open when all windows have been closed to facilitate opening documents or new windows without pointlessly disposing of the existing process only to start another.It’s been like that for the Mac’s entire existence. For someone who’s used Macs all their life, the Windows way is weird. reply williamcotton 3 hours agorootparentprevClosing a window has never closed a Mac application. Like, since the first Macs. Applications can have multiple windows so it makes sense from a UX perspective to not terminate an application when a window closes, even if it is the last window.This behavior can easily be overridden by application developers but they choose not to go against expected behavior.Power users press Command + Q to quit an application.I&#x27;ve literally never struggled with what you&#x27;re describing. reply bigstrat2003 1 hour agorootparentIt makes zero sense from a UX perspective to not terminate (most) processes when the last window closes. Exceptions do exist, but for example if I close all my word processor windows then the process does no good continuing to run. I think you make a fair point that Mac users are used to this behavior and so it should probably remain consistent. But if you were to redesign the OS from the ground up, it&#x27;s horrible behavior that should in no way be the default. reply pfranz 4 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;ll try to set a keyboard shortcut (not a global one mind you) in iTerm2 and suddenly I need to enable iTerm2 to have accessibility access?Maybe this could be more clear in iTerm&#x27;s UI, but the reason it needs accessibility access is in scenarios where it&#x27;s stomping on Mac OS&#x27; system shortcut keys. I would expect Windows or Linux would need special privileges to do the same. reply miki123211 5 hours agorootparentprev> Discord will direct you to disable SIP if you want to .. capture audio during screensharesThis is untrue, there&#x27;s a difference between disabling SIP and changing your security policy to \"reduced.\"Disabling SIP lets you modify files on the system volume along with a few other things, like a way to run executables that require private entitlements that aren&#x27;t signed by Apple. The reduced security policy lets you run older Mac OS versions (there&#x27;s no online signature check during installs) as well as kernel extensions from authorized developers.Discord relies on the latter, as it uses the ACE extension for audio capture, the same one that powers Rogue Amoeba&#x27;s excellent apps. There are APIs to do this natively now, introduced in Ventura I believe, but Discord hasn&#x27;t yet switched over to them. reply jchw 5 hours agorootparentYeah, I have an app that relies on the Rogue Amoeba kext. Probably Zoom or something.I admit I glossed over the details of SIP partly because I forgot, but the point is that to get audio capture working on Discord ~~right now~~ (Apparently according to neighboring comment this is fixed, but the point does still stand anyways since this literally was the situation for users since Apple Silicon arrived afaik), you have to go into recovery and run some esoteric commands to lower the security level of the machine, and it&#x27;s 100% Apple&#x27;s fault because they didn&#x27;t offer APIs for things that people were using kexts for before shutting off third-party kexts.(And this whole thing feels a bit rushed, as can be seen by the issues that have occurred with the newer usermode network filtering APIs...

This sounds exactly the same kind of weird handwaving Linux fanboys routinely get scolded for. And \"It&#x27;s better than Windows\" doesn&#x27;t make it good, but the fact is that you don&#x27;t have to do this for any kind of keybinding in Windows, so it&#x27;s neither here nor there. reply soraminazuki 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s strange because you have distorted the facts. iTerm doesn&#x27;t \"suddenly\" ask for accessibility permissions. You, by your own description, have attempted to make global changes to the macOS GUI. That&#x27;s a legitimate and expected situation for an accessibility permission dialog to show up. reply jchw 2 hours agorootparentWhy does changing a keybind inside of iTerm 2 need global accessibility permissions? By my own words, it&#x27;s not a global shortcut, because well, it wasn&#x27;t.> I&#x27;ll try to set a keyboard shortcut (not a global one mind you)(I will admit that the phrase \"keyboard shortcut\" instead of something like \"key binding\" likely lead to this confusion, but by the time this occurred to me, the edit window was already closed.)This hit me just recently when trying to map Command+P to Control+P. I don&#x27;t know if Command+P is somehow special, but if you want to try it for yourself, feel free.Secondly, though, accessibility permission is a really large hammer. Typically that&#x27;s a high level of privileges as it usually means being able to read and interact with just about everything on-screen. Granted, this is the reality of many desktop OSes today anyways, but that&#x27;s the other thing. If I have to switch all of these permissions on for many apps anyways, is this really a good design? No, of course not.I tried to keep my rant relatively contained, because the truth is I hate macOS a lot worse. A software I used to like a lot, SnagIt, has become progressively less usable as macOS has updated over time, presumably because apps that handle screenshots and video capture have had to get increasingly tricky to function. Just about every time SnagIt starts, it gives me a laundry list of permissions I need to grant it. I mean literally it has to be like 7 things. Most of them seem to stick, but apparently after the software updates some of them need to be done again.This security model sucks in other ways too. Like for example, you have to give your terminal emulator full disk access. If you don&#x27;t, really stupid things will happen. I accidentally ran brew update in a VS Code terminal. It worked! And promptly wiped out all of the granted permissions on all of the casks it updated, because VS Code (of course) doesn&#x27;t have full disk access, and as part of the security model you can&#x27;t just update an app without full disk access. I really wish that wasn&#x27;t the default behavior, because it was genuinely just a mistake to use the VS Code terminal for that. But even worse, I really want to grant this permission to Brew and not literally everything I run in that terminal emulator, so this is pretty damn unideal.I haven&#x27;t even gotten into Gatekeeper, OCSP stapling, and all of the trouble I have gone through trying to sign apps for macOS and have it not need to phone home to check the signature. (I was also hit by that funny bug where programs were taking forever to execute because the exec syscall was hanging waiting for Apple&#x27;s servers. Reminds me that I am on a \"privacy friendly\" OS.)But seriously, I&#x27;m really only scratching the surface here. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I hate other OSes too. I have an ongoing rant right next to this one about how much I hate Windows 11, and I don&#x27;t think I really need to express how bad desktop Linux is from a usability standpoint. replyglimshe 5 hours agorootparentprevI take this refreshing shower at night, when I close my Mac work computer and go use my Windows personal computer. Everything is easy to accomplish, my personal use software just works and I don&#x27;t have to struggle with extra clicks and movements for everything. It&#x27;s incredible how different people are - and that&#x27;s a good thing. reply soraminazuki 2 hours agorootparentPeople are free to have their own opinions. But some things aren&#x27;t matters of options, but hard cold facts.Windows, especially after Windows 10, has been actively hostile and repeatedly ignores the clear will of its users.At boot time, it regularly takes the computer hostage in an attempt to coerce me to mass-enable its many spywares. After disabling then one by one, I can login to my desktop only to find that it has changed my default browser again. So I have to change that back, which is kind of futile because various parts of the OS now ignores the default browser settings anyway. After that, I have to dismiss the relentless ads and remove the crapware that keeps getting installed at every turn and corner.This is a very, very far cry from \"everything is easy to accomplish, my personal use software just works and I don&#x27;t have to struggle with extra clicks and movements for everything.\" Both things can&#x27;t be true at the same time. I have to click, click, click, go through all sorts of hoops, and finally give up and throw my computer out the window in frustration to try to achieve what I want in Windows. And what for?

I don&#x27;t use Windows anymore, but I still occasionally set up Windows for other people and there&#x27;s so many annoyances that it&#x27;s difficult to even enumerate all of them.Off the top of my head:- MSEdgeRedirect to stop Windows from opening Edge even when it&#x27;s not your defualt browser.- Shutup10++ to quickly disable a bunch of crapware&#x2F;unwanted features. (Some of these break things, too, so there is literally no way to make things \"perfect\".)- Have to remove a horde of advertising-ridden crapware too. Groove Music, Maps, etc.- Stopping the start menu from sending everything you type to Bing seems to be hard, too. I&#x27;m pretty sure there are multiple group policy items that sound like they would impact this, but I never seem to get the right one first try. It&#x27;s kind of hard to find on Google too because it changes.- I do not know what the current best way to get Windows to stop trying to wake up computers for Windows Update at random hours (and often failing to do so.) I think there is a group policy option, but I think there&#x27;s also a power options configuration (also in the registry obviously) that you need to change to maximally disable wakelocks. This one isn&#x27;t necessarily Windows 11 specific, but it seems to have gotten worse over time.- A number of things are really hard to change: There are third party mods for the start menu and task bar, but they are not perfect at all; hacks that load the actual old start menu and task bar are limited and break with updates, unsurprisingly. You need to patch DWM to remove the window rounding behavior.And honestly, that still doesn&#x27;t duplicate Windows 7 for me, and worse, the further you stray away the more likely things are to break during updates. The best I&#x27;ve found is Windows 10 LTSC but 1. I don&#x27;t think consumers can legally license it (lol) 2. It doesn&#x27;t work with a lot of software, e.g. Creative Suite has stopped supporting it I believe. So this solution sounds good on paper but it&#x27;s also not always applicable.Lest you think paying extra for Windows 11 Pro for Workstations, just don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s nearly as heavy in crapware last I checked.

    "originBody": "Blog/Engineering Migrating to OpenTelemetry Benjamin Yolken Nov 16, 2023 7 min read At Airplane, we collect observability data from our own systems as well as remote “agents” that are running in our customers’ infrastructure. The associated outputs, which include the standard “three pillars of observability” (logs, metrics, and traces) are essential for us to monitor our infrastructure and also help customers debug problems in theirs. Over the last year, we’ve made a concerted effort to migrate most of our observability data generation and collection to the OpenTelemetry (OTel) standard. This has allowed us to collect data more reliably from more places, connect more easily with different vendors, and better monitor and control our costs. In the remainder of this post, we explain what OpenTelemetry is, how we managed the migration, and lessons we learned along the way. Aside: What is OTel? OpenTelemetry (or OTel for short) is a set of standards and tools for processing observability data. It starts by defining the basic concepts (e.g., what a metric is) and the protocols for transmitting observability data from one system to another. It then provides a set of SDK libraries that allow for the instrumentation of applications in various programming languages (Python, Java, Golang, etc.) and the pushing of data via the former protocols. Finally, it provides a collector, a centralized component that receives data from various sources, applies arbitrary transformations to it, and exports the data to one or more downstream destinations. There are a few nice things about OTel that make it superior to legacy observability frameworks. First, it’s vendor agnostic. In theory, you can instrument a system and export observability data without being concerned about whether it’s ultimately going to Datadog, Splunk, Dynatrace, or some other vendor. And, even better, you can switch between these vendors without rewriting your applications. Second, it unifies the different types of observability data, so you don’t need separate libraries and implementations for logs, metrics, and traces. And third, it has fairly solid library support for the most common programming languages and application frameworks. Original architecture Before describing our migration to OTel, it’s helpful to summarize what kinds of observability data Airplane has and how we were collecting it pre-migration. As mentioned in the introduction, Airplane has its own systems, plus “agents” that run in the infrastructure of our customers. We also have Airplane frontend code running in our customers’ browsers. Thus, there are effectively 9 different streams of observability data: {logs, metrics, traces} x {Airplane-hosted infra, customer-hosted infra, customer browsers}. The data collected from these streams is sent to several vendors including Datadog (for application logs and metrics), Honeycomb (for traces), and Google Cloud Logging (for infrastructure logs). Originally, collection from customer-hosted infrastructure and browsers was minimal. When needed for debugging purposes, the state of these systems was pieced together via their calls to Airplane’s APIs (e.g., to poll for new task runs) plus information that customers supplied to us manually on request (e.g., screenshots of logs). On the Airplane side, we relied heavily on the Datadog agent for both logs and metrics. The latter is a component that runs on each machine in an organization’s infrastructure, scraping logs and metrics for whatever is running on that machine and sending the data directly to Datadog’s collection APIs. For metrics, the Datadog agent can either scrape metrics from each process using the Prometheus protocol or receive metrics that are pushed to it by each application using a protocol like Statsd. We originally decided to go with the former approach, and thus each of our applications exposed its metrics via an HTTP /metrics endpoint that was periodically read by the agent. Trace data from Airplane-hosted infrastructure, on the other hand, was sent directly from our API to Honeycomb, our tracing vendor. We were already using OTel libraries for collecting and sending this data (Honeycomb’s API is fully OTel-compliant), so no significant migration was required here. However, we weren’t collecting traces from any systems other than our API, and we wanted to expand that. Making the switch Setting up the collector The first step was to set up an OTel collector in each of our environments. As described previously, this is a component that receives observability data, processes it, and then exports it to vendor-specific collection endpoints for services like Datadog or Honeycomb. The OTel collector was fairly easy to set up within our existing infrastructure- it’s a golang server that’s configured via a single YAML file. This config file specifies how data is received (e.g., via what protocols and on which ports), how the data should be transformed, and the downstream destinations that the data should be sent to. The collector config documentation is generally well-written, but spread across a few places- the official OTel docs site, the collector GitHub repo, and the “contrib” GitHub repo, which is where most of the vendor-specific integrations are hosted. After some trial-and-error, we managed to create a config for collecting logs, metrics, and traces, and sending them to Datadog and Honeycomb. The following shows a simplified version with some annotation comments: yaml Note that the collector has many other features that we decided not to use, particularly around data aggregation and filtering. We may enable these in the future, however, to reduce the data volumes that we send to our vendors downstream. Once our collector service was up, we put internal and external load balancers in front of it so that both internal services and external agents could send it data. Instrumentation The next step was to instrument our applications to gather and send useful data to the collector. This was done in a set of small, independent projects, including: Exporting traces from our UI to the collector Exporting observability data from customer-hosted agents to the collector Switching metrics in Airplane-hosted systems from Prometheus+Datadog to OTel Our frontend code is written in TypeScript and our backend systems use golang, so this involved integrating the OTel JavaScript and Go SDKs, respectively. The language-specific instrumentation guides in the OTel docs were very helpful here. Switching our internal metrics was the most involved project because it required refactoring the pipelines that provide data for our (heavily used) internal dashboards and alerts. Moreover, we encountered some rough edges in the metrics-related functionality of the Go SDK referenced above. Ultimately, we had to write a conversion layer on top of the OTel metrics API that allowed for simple, Prometheus-like counters, gauges, and histograms. In the end, we decided to not send certain flows through the collector. In the case of logs from our internal systems, we found that it was easiest to use our cloud provider, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), for collecting and distributing them. GCP’s log tooling is pretty powerful and easy to configure for applications in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), where we host most of our services. GCP is also the source for many of our non-application-based logs (e.g., DB errors), so we would be depending on this service whether or not we used it for application logs. For internal traces, we decided to keep sending these directly to Honeycomb since Honeycomb already uses the OTel protocol (OTLP) and going through a collector wouldn’t add much value here. Parting thoughts Overall, we’ve been very happy with our new, OTel-oriented observability stack. First, the SDKs and collector have been rock solid- we’ve had no significant issues running these at scale in production. As mentioned previously, the Golang SDK does have some rough edges (and doesn’t support logs at all yet), but we were able to get around these without too much trouble by writing some custom code on top of the OTel-provided interfaces. Second, having an OTel collector has made it much easier to collect and process observability data from systems outside of our infrastructure. These systems can push their data to our collector, and thus we don’t need to worry about writing our own clients and servers for these flows or deal with scraping third-party destinations. Third, OTel has allowed us to save a significant amount of money on our Datadog bill! Because we now use a centralized collector instead of per-node Datadog agents, the number of hosts that Datadog sees is significantly reduced. At $15 / host / month, we’ve been able to shave thousands off of our monthly Datadog charges. Fourth, OTel allows us to more easily switch vendors in the future. We stuck with Datadog and Honeycomb during the migration, but it’s nice to know that if we wanted to try out others in the future, we could make that switch fairly easily. If your organization is processing a lot of observability data, it may be worth investigating OTel as a solution for increased control and flexibility. And if you’re an Airplane user, you can also natively stream audit logs from your Airplane tasks to your OTel collector using our log drains feature.

I am a founder building in this space[1] and we see many of our users switching to opentelemetry as that provides an easy way to switch if needed in future.At SigNoz, we have metrics, traces and logs in a single application which helps you correlate across signals much more easily - and being natively based on opentelemetry makes this correlation much easier as it leverages the standard data format.Though this might take sometime, as many teams have proprietary SDK in their code, which is not easy to rip out. Opentelemetry auto-instrumentation[2] makes it much easier, and I think that&#x27;s the path people will follow to get started[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SigNoz&#x2F;signoz [2]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentelemetry.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;instrumentation&#x2F;java&#x2F;automatic... reply dexterdog 12 hours agoparentprevDepending on your usage it can be prohibitively expensive to use datadog for everything like that.

Out applications are designed to emit traces, and comparing honeycomb with tracing to a traditional app with metrics and logs, I would choose tracing every time.It annoys me that logs are overlooked in honeycomb, (and metrics are... fine). But, given the choice between a single pane of glass in grafana or having to do logs (and metrics sometimes) in cloudwatch but spending 95% of my time in honeycomb - I&#x27;d pick honeycomb every time reply mdtusz 12 hours agorootparentAgreed - honeycomb has been a boon, however some improvements to metric displays and the ability to set the default \"board\" used in the home page would be very welcome. Also would be pretty happy if there was a way to drop events on the honeycomb side for a way to dynamically filter - e.g. \"don&#x27;t even bother storing this trace if it has a http.status_codeIt sounds like they were in a place that a lot of companies are in where they don&#x27;t have a single pane of glass for observability.One of the biggest features of AWS which is very easy to take for granted and go unnoticed is Amazon CloudWatch. It supports metrics, logging, alarms, metrics from alarms, alarms from alarms, querying historical logs, trigger actions, etc etc etc. and it covers each and every single service provided by AWS including metaservices like AWS Config and Cloudtrail.And you barely notice it. It&#x27;s just there, and you can see everything.> One of the terrible mistakes I see companies make with this tooling is fragmenting like this.So much this. It&#x27;s not fun at all to have to go through logs and metrics on any application,and much less so if for some reason their maintainers scattered their metrics emission to the four winds. However, with AWS all roads lead to Cloudwatch, and everything is so much better. reply yourapostasy 10 hours agorootparent> ...with AWS all roads lead to Cloudwatch, and everything is so much better.Most of my clients are not in the product-market fit for AWS CloudWatch, because most of their developers don&#x27;t have the development, testing and operational maturity&#x2F;discipline to use CloudWatch cost-effectively (this is at root an organization problem, but let&#x27;s not go off onto that giant tangent). So the only realistic tracing strategy we converged upon to recommend for them is \"grab everything, and retain it up to the point in time we won&#x27;t be blamed for not knowing root cause\" (which in some specific cases can be up to years!), while we undertake the long journey with them to upskill their teams.This would make using CloudWatch everywhere rapidly climb up into the top three largest line item in the AWS bill, easily justifying spinning that tracing functionality in-house. So we wind up opting into self-managed tooling like Elastic Observability or Honeycomb where the pricing is friendlier to teams in unfortunate situations that need to start with everything for CYA, much as I would like to stay within CloudWatch.Has anyone found a better solution to these use cases where the development maturity level is more prosaic, or is this really the best local maxima at the industry&#x27;s current SOTA? reply tapoxi 15 hours agoprevI made this switch very recently. For our Java apps it was as simple as loading the otel agent in place of the Datadog SDK, basically \"-javaagent:&#x2F;opt&#x2F;otel&#x2F;opentelemetry-javaagent.jar\" in our args.The collector (which processes and ships metrics) can be installed in K8S through Helm or an operator, and we just added a variable to our charts so the agent can be pointed at the collector. The collector speaks OTLP which is the fancy combined metrics&#x2F;traces&#x2F;logs protocol the OTEL SDKs&#x2F;agents use, but it also speaks Prometheus, Zipkin, etc to give you an easy migration path. We currently ship to Datadog as well as an internal service, with the end goal being migrating off of Datadog gradually. reply andrewstuart2 15 hours agoparentWe tried this about a year and a half ago and ended up going somewhat backwards into DD entrenchment, because they&#x27;ve decided that anything not an official DD metric (that is, collected by their agent typically) is custom and then becomes substantially more expensive. We wanted a nice migration path from any vendor to any other vendor but they have a fairly effective strategy for making gradual migrations more expensive for heavy telemetry users. At least our instrumentation these days is otel, but it&#x27;s the metrics we expected to just scrape from prometheus that we had to dial back and start using more official DD agent metrics and configs to get, lest our bill balloon by 10x. It&#x27;s a frustrating place to be. Especially since it&#x27;s still not remotely cheap, just that it could be way worse.I know this isn&#x27;t a DataDog post, and I&#x27;m a bit off topic, but I try to do my best to warn against DD these days. reply shawnb576 14 hours agorootparentThis has been a concern for me too. But the agent is just a statsd receiver with some extra magic, so this seems like a thing that could be solved with the collector sending traffic to an agent rather than the HTTP APIs?I looked at the OTel DD stuff and did not see any support for this, fwiw, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work b&#x2F;c the agent expects more context from the pod (e.g. app and label?) reply andrewstuart2 14 hours agorootparentYeah, the DD agent and the otel-collector DD exporter actually use the same code paths for the most part. The relevant difference tends to be in metrics, where the official path involves the DD agent doing collection directly, for example, collecting redis metrics by giving the agent your redis database hostname and creds. It can then pack those into the specific shape that DD knows about and they get sent with the right name, values, etc so that DD calls them regular metrics.If you instead went the more flexible route of using many of the de-facto standard prometheus exporters like the one for redis, or built-in prometheus metrics from something like istio, and forward those to your agent or configure your agent to poll those prometheus metrics, it won&#x27;t do any reshaping (which I can see the arguments for, kinda, knowing a bit about their backend) and they just end up in the DD backend as custom metrics, and charge you at $0.10&#x2F;mo per 100 time series. If you&#x27;ve used prometheus before for any realistic deployments with enrichment etc, you can probably see this gets expensive ridiculously fast.What I wish they&#x27;d do instead is have some form of adapter from those de facto standards, so I can still collect metrics 99% my own way, in a portable fashion, and then add DD as my backend without ending up as custom everything, costing significantly more. reply xyst 14 hours agorootparentprev> somewhat backwards into DD entrenchment, because they&#x27;ve decided that anything not an official DD metric (that is, collected by their agent typically) is custom and then becomes substantially more expensive.It a vendor pulled shit like this on me. That’s when I would counsel them. Of course most big orgs would rather not do the leg work to actually become portable, migrate off vendor. So of course they will just pay the bill.Vendors love the custom shit they build because they know once it’s infiltrated the stack then it’s basically like gangrene (have to cut off the appendage to save the host) reply Jedd 9 hours agoprevThe killer feature of OpenTelemetry for us is brokering (with ETL).Partly this lets us easily re-route & duplicate telemetry, partly it means changes to backend products in the future won&#x27;t be a big disruption.For metrics we&#x27;re a mostly telegraf->prometheus->grafana mimir shop - telegraf because its rock solid and feature-rich, prometheus because there&#x27;s no real competition in that tier, and mimir because of scale & self-host options.Our scale problem means most online pricing calculators generate overflow errors.Our non-security log destination preference is Loki - for similar reasons to Mimir - though a SIEM it definitely is not.Tracing to a vendor, but looking to bring that back to grafana Tempo. Product maturity is a long way off commercial APM offerings, but it feels like the feature-set is about 70% there and converging rapidly. Off-the-shelf tracing products have an appealingly low cost of entry, which only briefly defers lock-in & pricing shocks. reply pranay01 6 hours agoparentYeah, the ability to send to multiple sources is quite powerful and most of this comes from the configurability of Otel Collector [1].If you are looking for a open source backend for OpenTelemetry, then you can explore SigNoz[2] (I am one of the founders) We have a quite a decent product for APM&#x2F;tracing leveraging opentelemerty native data format and semantic convention.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentelemetry.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;collector&#x2F; [2]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SigNoz&#x2F;signoz reply Jedd 5 hours agorootparentHi Pranay - actually I&#x27;ve had a signoz tab open for about 5 weeks - once I find time I&#x27;m meaning to run it up in my lab. reply pranay01 5 hours agorootparentAwesome!

Have you found they&#x27;re useful for different things, or is there enough overlap that you could use just one or the other? reply bhyolken 15 hours agoparentAuthor here, thanks for the question! The current split developed from the personal preferences of the engineers who initially set up our observability systems, based on what they had used (and liked) at previous jobs.We&#x27;re definitely open to doing more consolidation in the future, especially if we can save money by doing that, but from a usability standpoint we&#x27;ve been pretty happy with Honeycomb for traces and Datadog for everything else so far. And, that seems to be aligned with what each vendor is best at at the moment. reply MuffinFlavored 14 hours agorootparent> from the personal preferences of the engineershttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.honeycomb.io&#x2F;pricinghttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datadoghq.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;Am I wrong to say... having 2 is \"expensive\"? Maybe not if 50% of your stuff is going to Honeycomb and 50% going to DataDog. Could you save money&#x2F;complexity (less places to look for things) having just DataDog or just Honeycomb? reply bhyolken 14 hours agorootparentRight now, there isn&#x27;t much duplication of what we&#x27;re sending to each vendor, so I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d save a ton by consolidating, at least based on list prices. We could maybe negotiate better prices based on higher volumes, but I&#x27;m not sure if Airplane is spending enough at this point to get massive discounts there.Another potential benefit would definitely be reduced complexity and better integration for the engineering team. So, for instance, you could look at a log and then more easily navigate to the UI for the associated trace. Currently, we do this by putting Honeycomb URLs in our Datadog log events, which works but isn&#x27;t quite as seamless. But, given that our team is pretty small at this point and that we&#x27;re not spending a ton of our time on performance optimizations, we don&#x27;t feel an urgent need to consolidate (yet). reply MuffinFlavored 13 hours agorootparentWhen you say DataDog for everything else (as in not traces), besides logs, what else do you mean? reply claytonjy 13 hours agorootparentMetrics, probably? The article calls out logs, metrics, and traces as the 3 pillars of observability. reply bhyolken 13 hours agorootparentYeah, metrics and logs, plus a few other things that depend on these (alerts, SLOs, metric-based dashboards, etc.). replynevon 12 hours agoprevI would love to save a few hundred thousands a year by running Otel collector over Datadog agents, just on the cost-per-host alone. Unfortunately that would also mean giving up Datatog APM and NPM, as far as I can tell, which have been really valuable. Going back to just metrics and traces would feel like quite the step backwards and be a hard sell. reply arccy 11 hours agoparentyou can submit opentelemetry traces to datadog which should be the equivalent of apm&#x2F;npm, though maybe with a less polished integration. reply nevon 4 hours agorootparentJust traces are a long way off from APM and NPM. APM gives me the ability to debug memory leaks from continuous heap snapshots, or performance issues through CPU profiling. NPM is almost like having tcpdump running constantly, showing me where there&#x27;s packet loss or other forms of connectivity issues. reply porker 2 hours agorootparentThank you for sharing this, I&#x27;ve had \"look at tracing\" on my to do list for months and assumed it was identical to APM. It seems it won&#x27;t be a direct substitute, which helps explain the cost difference. reply nullify88 2 hours agoprevOne thing that&#x27;s slightly off putting about OpenTelemetry is how resource attributes don&#x27;t get included as prometheus labels for metrics, instead they are on an info metric which requires a join to enrich the metric you are interested in.Luckily the prometheus exporters have a switch to enable this behaviour, but there&#x27;s talk of removing this functionality because it breaks the spec. If you were to use the OpenTelemetry protocol in to something like Mimir, you don&#x27;t have the option of enabling that behaviour unless you use prometheus remote write.Our developers aren&#x27;t a fan of that.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentelemetry.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;specs&#x2F;otel&#x2F;compatibility&#x2F;prome... reply roskilli 14 hours agoprev> Moreover, we encountered some rough edges in the metrics-related functionality of the Go SDK referenced above. Ultimately, we had to write a conversion layer on top of the OTel metrics API that allowed for simple, Prometheus-like counters, gauges, and histograms.Have encountered this a lot from teams attempting to use the metrics SDK.Are you open to comment on specifics here and also what kind of shim you had to put in front of the SDK? It would be great to continue to retrieve feedback so that we can as a community have a good idea of what remains before it&#x27;s possible to use the SDK for real world production use cases in anger. Just wiring up the setup in your app used to be fairly painful but that has gotten somewhat better over the last 12-24 months, I&#x27;d love to also hear what is currently causing compatibility issues w&#x2F; the metric types themselves using the SDK which requires a shim and what the shim is doing to achieve compatibility. reply bhyolken 13 hours agoparentSure, happy to provide more specifics!Our main issue was the lack of a synchronous gauge. The officially supported asynchronous API of registering a callback function to report a gauge metric is very different from how we were doing things before, and would have required lots of refactoring of our code. Instead, we wrote a wrapper that exposes a synchronous-like API: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;yolken-airplane&#x2F;027867b753840f7d15d6....It seems like this is a common feature request across many of the SDKs, and it&#x27;s in the process of being fixed in some of them (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;open-telemetry&#x2F;opentelemetry-specificatio...)? I&#x27;m not sure what the plans are for the golang SDK specifically.Another, more minor issue, is the lack of support for \"constant\" attributes that are applied to all observations of a metric. We use these to identify the app, among other use cases, so we added wrappers around the various \"Add\", \"Record\", \"Observe\", etc. calls that automatically add these. (It&#x27;s totally possible that this is supported and I missed it, in which case please let me know.)Overall, the SDK was generally well-written and well-documented, we just needed some extra work to make the interfaces more similar to the ones we were using before. reply roskilli 7 hours agorootparentThanks for the detailed response.I am surprised there is no gauge update API yet (instead of callback only), this is a common use case and I don&#x27;t think folks should be expected to implement their own. Especially since it will lead to potentially allocation heavy bespoke implementations, depending on use case given mutex+callback+other structures that likely need to be heap allocated (vs a simple int64 wrapper with atomic update&#x2F;load APIs).Also I would just say that the fact the APIs differ a lot to more common popular Prometheus client libraries does beg the question of do we need more complicated APIs that folks have a harder time using. Now is the time to modernize these before everyone is instrumented with some generation of a client library that would need to change&#x2F;evolve. The whole idea of an OTel SDK is instrument once and then avoid needing to re-instrument again when making changes to your observability pipeline and where it&#x27;s pointed. This becomes a hard sell if OTel SDK needs to shift fairly significantly to support more popular & common use cases with more typical APIs and by doing so leaves a whole bunch of OTel instrumented code that needs to be modernized to a different looking API. reply arccy 11 hours agorootparentprevthe official SDKs will only support an api once there&#x27;s a spec that allows it.for const attributes, generally these should be defined at the resource &#x2F; provider level: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkg.go.dev&#x2F;go.opentelemetry.io&#x2F;otel&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;metric#WithR... reply caust1c 15 hours agoprevCurious about the code implemented for logs!

For logs, we actually use github.com&#x2F;segmentio&#x2F;events and just implemented a handler for that library that batches logs and periodically flushes them out to our collector using the underlying protocol buffer interface.

I see this dogma accepted everywhere, but I&#x27;m inquisitive about it reply yannyu 11 hours agoparentFirst you had logs. Everyone uses logs because it&#x27;s easy. Logs are great, but suddenly you&#x27;re spending a crapton of time or money maintaining terabytes or petabytes of storage and ingest of logs. And even worse, in some cases for these logs, you don&#x27;t actually care about 99% of the log line and simply want a single number, such as CPU utilization or the value of the shopping cart or latency.So, someone says, \"let&#x27;s make something smaller and more portable than logs. We need to track numerical data over time more easily, so that we can see pretty charts of when these values are outside of where they should be.\" This ends up being metrics and a time-series database (TSDB), built to handle not arbitrary lines of text but instead meant to parse out metadata and append numerical data to existing time-series based on that metadata.Between metrics and logs, you end up with a good idea of what&#x27;s going on with your infrastructure, but logs are still too verbose to understand what&#x27;s happening with your applications past a certain point. If you have an application crashing repeatedly, or if you&#x27;ve got applications running slowly, metrics and logs can&#x27;t really help you there. So companies built out Application Performance Monitoring, meant to tap directly into the processes running on the box and spit out all sorts of interesting runtime metrics and events about not just the applications, but the specific methods and calls those applications are utilizing within their stack&#x2F;code.Initially, this works great if you&#x27;re running these APM tools on a single box within monolithic stacks, but as the world moved toward Cloud Service Providers and containerized&#x2F;ephemeral infrastructure, APM stopped being as effective. When a transaction starts to go through multiple machines and microservices, APM deployed on those boxes individually can&#x27;t give you the context of how these disparate calls relate to a holistic transaction.So someone says, \"hey, what if we include transaction IDs in these service calls, so that we can post-hoc stitch together these individual transaction lines into a whole transaction, end-to-end?\" Which is how you end up with the concept of spans and traces, taking what worked well with Application Performance Monitoring and generalizing that out into the modern microservices architectures that are more common today. reply tsamba 14 hours agoprevInteresting read. What did you find easier about using GCP&#x27;s log tooling for your internal system logs, rather than the OTel collector? reply bhyolken 8 hours agoparentAuthor here. This decision was more about ease of implementation than anything else. Our internal application logs were already being scooped up by GCP because we run our services in GKE, and we already had a GCP->Datadog log syncer [1] for some other GCP infra logs, so re-using the GCP-based pipeline was the easiest way to handle our application logs once we removed the Datadog agent.In the future, we&#x27;ll probably switch these logs to also go through our collector, and it shouldn&#x27;t be super hard (because we already implemented a golang OTel log handler for the external case), but we just haven&#x27;t gotten around to it yet.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.datadoghq.com&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;google_cloud_platfor... reply clintonb 9 hours agoparentprevTheir collector is used to send infrastructure logs to GCP (instead of Datadog).My guess is this is to save on costs.

I’ve done a lot of sysadmin work, and I can tell you that a lot of companies just don’t have a repeatable environment. That said, my suspicion is these days, with a good container type solution, if you maintain that, and support just what’s inside that boundary, that can go a long way to mitigate calls. Of course, I love containers until they break, especially when they break because of some implied dependency changes. reply scubakid 8 hours agorootparentAh, makes sense.

What part of the journey are you in at this stage? reply golergka 16 hours agoprevHey, me too.I&#x27;ve started reading HN around 2012, when I was more of a game designer than developer. Throughout the years, I&#x27;ve changed into developer stack, grew professionally, changed game dev for fullstack web development, grew to love functional programming and embraced a lot of things doing \"the HN\" way. I even switched from regional companies to working for american companies remotely — thanks to \"Who&#x27;s hiring threads\"! And when I&#x27;m talking to my american colleagues now, we share a lot of the same culture — SICP, \"considered harmful\", \"just a monoid of endofunctors\", all of which I learned here. Now I&#x27;m working on my O1 visa application, and once again, I wouldn&#x27;t be here if not for HN.And for the point of comparison, there&#x27;s been this other social app, which I won&#x27;t name, that requires a tech company email to access. For a long time, while I didn&#x27;t work for a recognised american company, I thought of it as an exclusive closed club and assumed that there should be much better content there. But once I finally got access to it, it turned out to be a complete anon cesspool of bragging about TC, cheating on interviews and other things from people who came to tech just for the money, without any glimpse of love for the craft.After using that other app for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve deleted it never to log on again and now even more surprised to see how great a community HN turned out to be. reply oneepic 15 hours agoparentI had a very similar experience with a toxic app like that :) I must say that I found a handful of valuable threads&#x2F;comments that helped me, so perhaps it&#x27;s not all bad. reply JaDogg 4 hours agoparentprevThis is why I never created a blind account.

(Photograph: ETH Zurich/Thomas Buchner) In brief By making 3D printing suitable for slow-curing polymers, researchers have greatly expanded the possibilities of soft robotics. The new materials have advantages over the previous ones. The advances were possible thanks to a new technology that combines 3D printing with a laser scanner and a feedback mechanism. A spin-off in the US now offers this technology and prints complex objects on customer request. 3D printing is advancing rapidly, and the range of materials that can be used has expanded considerably. While the technology was previously limited to fast-curing plastics, it has now been made suitable for slow-curing plastics as well. These have decisive advantages as they have enhanced elastic properties and are more durable and robust. The use of such polymers is made possible by a new technology developed by researchers at ETH Zurich and a US start-up. As a result, researchers can now 3D print complex, more durable robots from a variety of high-quality materials in one go. This new technology also makes it easy to combine soft, elastic, and rigid materials. The researchers can also use it to create delicate structures and parts with cavities as desired. Materials that return to their original state Using the new technology, researchers at ETH Zurich have succeeded for the first time in printing a robotic hand with bones, ligaments and tendons made of different polymers in one go. “We wouldn’t have been able to make this hand with the fast-curing polyacrylates we’ve been using in 3D printing so far,” explains Thomas Buchner, a doctoral student in the group of ETH Zurich robotics professor Robert Katzschmann and first author of the study. “We’re now using slow-curing thiolene polymers. These have very good elastic properties and return to their original state much faster after bending than polyacrylates.” This makes thiolene polymers ideal for producing the elastic ligaments of the robotic hand. By playing the video you accept the privacy policy of YouTube.Learn more OK (Video: ETH Zurich / Nicole Davidson) In addition, the stiffness of thiolenes can be fine-tuned very well to meet the requirements of soft robots. “Robots made of soft materials, such as the hand we developed, have advantages over conventional robots made of metal. Because they’re soft, there is less risk of injury when they work with humans, and they are better suited to handling fragile goods,” Katzschmann explains. Scanning instead of scraping 3D printers typically produce objects layer by layer: nozzles deposit a given material in viscous form at each point; a UV lamp then cures each layer immediately. Previous methods involved a device that scraped off surface irregularities after each curing step. This works only with fast-curing polyacrylates. Slow-curing polymers such as thiolenes and epoxies would gum up the scraper. The robotic hand is printed layer by layer using polymers of varying elasticity (left: schematic, right: computer graphics). (Visualisations: Buchner TJK et al., Nature 2023) To accommodate the use of slow-curing polymers, the researchers developed 3D printing further by adding a 3D laser scanner that immediately checks each printed layer for any surface irregularities. “A feedback mechanism compensates for these irregularities when printing the next layer by calculating any necessary adjustments to the amount of material to be printed in real time and with pinpoint accuracy,” explains Wojciech Matusik, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US and co-author of the study. This means that instead of smoothing out uneven layers, the new technology simply takes the unevenness into account when printing the next layer. Other examples of 3D-printing include a legged robot and metamaterials. The latter could be used to absorb vibrations. (Photographs: ETH Zurich / Thomas Buchner) Inkbit, an MIT spin-off, was responsible for developing the new printing technology. The ETH Zurich researchers developed several robotic applications and helped optimise the printing technology for use with slow-curing polymers. The researchers from Switzerland and the US have now jointly published the technology and their sample applications in the journal Nature. At ETH Zurich, Katzschmann’s group will use the technology to explore further possibilities and to design even more sophisticated structures and develop additional applications. Inkbit is planning to use the new technology to offer a 3D printing service to its customers and to sell the new printers.

Inkjet 3D printers are awesome, the resolution is hard to beat, you can make parts with multiple materials as was shown in the article. Some can even print in color. But currently these machines tend to be very expensive, as in $250,000 and up. Worse, allegedly if you want to make full use of the printer&#x27;s capability you have to sign over your IP to the company that made the printer.Some people at MIT figured out how to build one cheaply and IIRC they even released plans for it online.[0]You can also buy phone case printers on AliExpress which use the same inkjet UV cure process for about $1500[1]. They allegedly have some limited capability to do 3D too.So it is possible to build 3d printers like this cheap enough that hobbyists could afford them. I suspect the reason they haven&#x27;t caught on is due to patents, one may not even be able to sell a kit to make such printers[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdfg.mit.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;multifab-machine-vision-as...

Same reason I don&#x27;t have a sla printer, not worth it.The projet 3500 is the coolest printer in this space if you do want one. It&#x27;s cool be a use the support material is paraffin wax, so to clean and cure the parts you just melt off the wax in a low temp oven and clean the parts in an ultrasonic cleaner with cooking oil in it. reply Kuinox 18 hours agoparentprevI tried to see what it take to build one.

But the actuator parts of the equation are pretty much the same as years ago.I think a large part of this is the old industry saying: \"Software is cheap&#x2F;easy, Hardware is expensive&#x2F;hard\", These days \"robots\" pretty much means a robot arm that is either a clunky pile of parts with an Arduino for the hobbyist market or a multi-thousand dollar industrial arm to move card boxes.I also don&#x27;t know if human movement is a well understood problem yet, everything I&#x27;ve seen until now looks pretty much a better version of movement from a &#x27;s sci-fi robot movie ( I&#x27;m not discounting the difficulty of this, just pointing out )Maybe this is the calm before the storm, now it&#x27;s all \"chat bots\" and it&#x27;s mostly inside our computers, when humanoid robots start to roam the streets and affecting the physical World it will be another ball game. reply numpad0 19 hours agoparentI&#x27;m not sure the angels necessarily need physical robotic bodies, or just have to have consequences of their direct actions fed back, to get grounded.

For anything like muscle, you&#x27;d need micromachines (comparable to actin-myosin) linking fibers (in muscle they&#x27;re about 50um in diameter and a few centimeters long) that would work in coordination using some kind of energy (in animals the fuel is ATP) source. reply owenpalmer 9 hours agorootparentI really hope this happens in my lifetime! Is anyone currently working on it? reply oooyay 14 hours agoprevThis reminds me of the real preemption to \"West World\". They had discovered cognitive machines and had them for some time, but printing \"bodies\" was the true break through that connected everything together. Pun intended. reply numpad0 19 hours agoprevOh, so this isn&#x27;t about optimizing torque&#x2F;force distribution for axes? I always thought it&#x27;ll be neat if I could move an arm parallel or orthogonal to an axis, simply by setting such predetermined set of servos to exact same values, thanks to such clever cross-coupling of joints. A bit like CoreXY, but requiring actual maths to set up, but computationally cheap to use.When us humans animate, don&#x27;t we tend to reveal such type of optimization that we can just add power to limbs to translate object, rather precisely, along cardinal directions as well as parallel directions, relative to our mental origin point? This is often explained as human brains being smart and doing fast IK calculations, but I doubt it.But I ended out creeping out someone while trying to show how I can easily mouse-drag my wrist joint parallel to screen coordinates, so in cases above didn&#x27;t apply to most, just disregard :p reply Euphorbium 20 hours agoprevI remember there was analogous project, that used inflatable muscles. It was at least 10 years ago, and at the time seemed like something from science fiction, but it was a real thing. reply ssfrr 19 hours agoprevThe status quo they describe is a printing process where material is deposited and then UV cured, then there’s some kind of scraping process. That seems like a hybrid of FDM and lithographic printing from a vat of goo a la FormLabs.Is that a common process? reply syntaxing 19 hours agoparentIndustrial equipment uses this technique often for different purposes like glueing. Might seem obvious but the scraping is an artifact from the UV curing, it happens for SLA printers too. There’s a reason why the vat is a FEP film since it has lubricating properties like PTFE so each layer peels off easily. Also fun fact, that’s what carbon3D printers are so damn fast. They have a semi permeable film that lets oxygen through which creates a thin barrier of “cured yet viscous” resin between the film and part so they don’t have to wait to peel or scrape anything. reply ilaksh 19 hours agoprevI wonder if there could be a way to use this technique to 3d print something like HASEL actuators for artificial muscles to go along with the tendons and bones. reply cmanion 18 hours agoparentI have been able to partially print them[0]. The electrodes we used could have been inkjet printed* and there is some potential of printing the dielectric fluid too. In the process I developed, the HASELs had to be filled with dielectric fluid during postprocessing, but it has been shown that it is possible to print closed volumes of fluid with inkjet 3d printers[1]. Although there is some risk the dielectric fluid could interfere with the curing of the polymer.*We also were able to develop a technique for printing electrodes without modifying the printer, but this hasn&#x27;t been published yet[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;343949671_Modeling_...[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;first-ever-3-d-printed-robots... reply ilaksh 17 hours agorootparentCongratulations!
