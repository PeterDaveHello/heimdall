The construction of the last of six towers will mark the completion of the structure of the basilica, the organization responsible for managing the site announced last week. “The Chapel of the Assumption is expected to be finished in 2025 and the tower of Jesus Christ, in 2026,” the Sagrada Familia said in a statement announcing the publication of its 2023 annual report. The tower of Jesus Christ will stand at 172.5 meters (566 feet) tall, and will be finished with a 17-meter-tall (56-foot) four-armed cross, according to the cathedral. When complete, the Sagrada Familia will become the world’s tallest church, overtaking Ulm Minster in Germany. Construction began in 1882 according to a design spearheaded by celebrated Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, who decided the monumental structure would have 18 huge, spindle-shaped towers, each symbolizing a different biblical figure—the 12 apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary and Jesus. When Gaudí died in 1926, only an estimated 10%-15% of the project had been built, including one transept, a crypt and some of the apse wall. Construction, already slow, was interrupted in the late 1930s by the Spanish Civil War, when most of the designs and models of Gaudí— whose tomb lies beneath the cathedral—were destroyed. Current designs are based on surviving and reconstructed materials, as well as reimagined adaptations of the original. In 1984, the building was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, and it was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI for religious worship in 2010. The construction of the church was carried out illegally for 137 years, until 2019, when a building permit was finally issued by Barcelona’s city council. Authorities only discovered the “anomaly” that it had never been granted planning permission in 2016.\",\"articleSection\":[\"travel\"],\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Jack Guy\",\"url\":\"\"}],\"dateModified\":\"2024-03-25T12:45:09.015Z\",\"description\":\"The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona will finally be finished in 2026, more than 140 years after construction started, officials have confirmed.\",\"headline\":\"Barcelona’s famous Sagrada Familia will finally be completed in 2026\",\"image\":[{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://media.c",

Maybe I misunderstand \"posthumous collaboration\", but the church is literally being built after Gaudi's demise by a bunch of other people, isn't that posthumous collaboration? reply mgkimsal 20 hours agorootparentMaybe not on the design and original plans? IIRC they're trying to do everything according to original designs, which would not be 'collaboration', just... implementation. It's been over 30 years since I was there though - some friends who went more recently said a lot more has been done since then. Might be fun to go back and look for the differences, but I do not remember much detail, just a sense of 'big'. reply gorbypark 19 hours agorootparentIf I am not mistaken, the original designs were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. reply whereismyacc 19 hours agorootparentYeah iirc his studio burned down at the hands of anarchist vandalists. Building some great indulgent monument to god wasn't exactly uncontroversial in the political climate at the time, as I understand it. Anyway, his plans wouldn't have been detailed enough to just go and build it. There was a lot of interpretation to be done in any case. reply felipeerias 7 hours agorootparentThe destruction of Gaudi’s studio wasn’t exceptional. The Republican forces destroyed many other religious buildings and works of art throughout Spain before and during the Civil War. reply epolanski 15 hours agorootparentprevI think all of this makes it a more fascinating building. reply azulster 18 hours agorootparentprevi understood it to mean that the architectural vision of Gaudi was so original and singular that and future work could only be completion of an original design, an imitation of the already completed work, or an obviously seperated style (like inserting a jazz solo in mozart) in contrast other architects worked within a well defined style with rules and systems that can be worked within by modern architects to \"posthumously\" collaborate. like how you can use the principles of gothic architecture to add a modern addition to a gothic cathedral. the only principle Gaudi followed was natural inspiration and his own interpretation of that, something nobody could ever define reply wzdd 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's just a nice way of saying it's difficult work because Gaudi was a genius and they can't hope to equal him. It doesn't mean they won't try their best. reply overview 20 hours agorootparentprevIt’s referring to the collaboration on the design itself. reply diggan 20 hours agorootparentEven that isn't true. Lots of original models/drawings have been lost, new designers interpret or reconstruct what they think Gaudi wanted to do, based on incomplete plans or where decisions weren't fully made. Not to mention new materials are available today that are being used and new processes/workflows which change the results slightly too. Sagrada Familia isn't a 100% implementation of the original vision, as even the original vision was incomplete when Gaudi died. reply rob74 19 hours agorootparentOk, maybe he didn't specify how all the statues, doors, windows and other embellishments should look like, but the basic structure and shape (the three portals and the 18 spires which also determine how the support columns in the interior of the church are placed) is the same as in Gaudí's original plans. reply lucianbr 16 hours agorootparentprevBuzzword bingo isn't restricted to software. The statement just says \"Gaudi was a great architect\". But it sounds more impressive to talk about \"posthumous collaboration\", especially if you don't analyze it. reply matthewdgreen 19 hours agorootparentprevThe original statement still makes sense, though, if you correctly interpret it as critique and warning. reply epolanski 15 hours agorootparentprev> Sagrada Familia isn't a 100% implementation of the original vision That's what makes it more interesting and fascinating. reply CPLX 18 hours agorootparentprevSometimes people say things indirectly. In this case what they are saying is that Gaudi’s design sense is so unique and iconoclastic that it’s essentially impossible to mix it with other styles of design. reply lqet 20 hours agoparentprev> It's amazing if you haven't gone, especially when sunlight streams in through the windows. I have been to Barcelona 4 times since I was a kid (1998, 2006, 2009, 2014), and every time the Sagrada Familia looked a little more finished, but still far from being completed.

We really want to go back. Just to sit there in awe of all of it. reply wouldbecouldbe 20 hours agoprevLooking at the surrounding building of the Sagrada, just makes me wonder again, what the hell happened to modern architecture. Modern architecture has destroyed our cities. It's hard to find a building build after WO2 that's actually pretty, let alone an entire neighborhood. Nothing compared the historic cities of Europe. In a time when it's cheaper then ever to build, they've not been able to build anything even close to pretty. The best they do is a bad copy of old style. reply audunw 18 hours agoparentWhat happened is that a vast quantity of people moved into and around the cities. We also have more strict building codes that take into account light, air quality, longevity, energy effiency etc. You’re looking at an old city built for a relatively small elite over many hundreds of years, and you’re surprised why cities built for many millions of people over a few decade look a bit basic in comparison? I came across some pre-WW2 photographs of a European city I know, of the more poor districts that don’t often get photographed. You think they looked nice? A modern apartment building looks much better than those cheap wooden shacks and lasts 100 times longer. I think there’s hope in the long term. My grandmas apartment building was built quickly and cheaply and looked like trash when I was a child. It has since been renovated with a nicer brick facade.

Often stairwells are hidden, sometimes behind multiple doors, so even going up a single flight of stairs usually involves waiting for an elevator. A lot of places seem to use space in a bizarre way - lobbies that are much too large and empty, the functional areas being cramped and small. Ceilings that are much too high, which not only waste space but lead to many functional issues (changing a bulb that’s 16 feet up is much more difficult than changing one that’s 8 feet up). Windows that are pulled back from the wall so they get much less natural lighting. The whole thing feels like the architectural profession became interested in impressing each other with designs that they thought looked cool, and seemed to forget that people actually had to use these spaces.

Later this rapid expansion of 'sameness' would be captured in popular media in songs like \"Little Boxes\". reply trgn 8 hours agorootparentThere was also an enormous urban population boom in the heyday of capitalism, late 1800s early 1900s, and architecture was absolutely glorious. It's really not the post war population boom. It was the post war mindset, modernism, a spiteful iconoclasm married to an infatuation with high technology (ie. All human experience must be mediated with the latest technology, a priori).

(At least, relative to steel and brick.) The modern glass curtain wall is popular because it is not load bearing and costs very little extra to hold up. High-rise steel frame was very expensive, and high-rise masonry basically impossible, because the frames also had to bear the weight of their own upper floors.

It really shows how bad people fail at building traditional buildings today. He makes a compelling argument for why his redesign makes more sense and to my eye the buildings tend to look much better and simpler too. It's based around some basic theory that had served builders well for a long time and has been thrown out to build gaudy things that imitate very poorly. One of my favorite observations of his is that a modern cheap door isn't even really a door - it's more a simulation of a door than an actual door. It is made of plastic and filled with foam but is made to look like wood and has stiles and rails and fake paneling pressed into the moulding to look like what people think a door looks like. And it comes in a pre-fabricated frame and is installed, not crafted. But it doesn't feel like a door or sound like a door. Just a flimsy thing that closes a passage off. And we admire installers today, not craftsmen. One thing about him, and I think he acknowledges it, is that efficiency and mass production are why so many more people can live in relatively nice homes today. Not everyone (in fact most people can't) can live in a well crafted home made from the best materials, etc. But I do agree with him that developers could at least try and make things that are rooted in some sense of design principal. reply reddog 18 hours agoparentprevYou might enjoy the Tom Wolfe book, From Bauhaus to Our House.

I remember reading Future Shock when I was quite young and the parts about people changing jobs quite often and living closer to nomads stuck with me, even though I have to say I've forgotten most of the book. Simply put anything modern is likely to change its purpose many times in the lifetime of the building. A company might have its headquarters in one place for 100 years, but probably not. It may move to a bigger building, be bought and dissolved, or go out of business before the usefulness of the building itself. Having a generic asset is worth more in cases like this. Same with housing and the 'millennial grey' people point out these days. Most people expect to move many, many times within their lives. I've moved 10 times myself, and I know people that have moved far more than that. A house is rarely looked at like a forever place, and few families seem to keep their houses in the family for multiple generations. Add to this that family size in the US is rapidly shrinking there are a lot of people who know their assets won't be passed on, but sold instead. reply MattGaiser 19 hours agoparentprevYou are understating cheaper to build. A lot of the beautiful buildings took decades if not centuries to construct. Cost hundreds of millions of dollars inflation-adjusted. They are also extremely expensive to maintain, as stone is expensive in so many ways. reply nemo44x 19 hours agoparentprevA few things. first off, we have code now. Until the 1950s you could do whatever you wanted. But nowadays there a bunch of things that need to be \"up to code\" and it's not just internals like electrical, etc. Stairways, railings, heights, room sizes, construction technique, etc are all affected by this. And we continue to add more and more code for things like efficiency, etc. And this isn't a bad thing - code means we have safer buildings and when someone buys a building there's at least a minimum standard that has been met. So this means you are going to build in ways that are proven and will be up to code. Which leads to the second thing. Construction materials have become standardized over the last 100 years or so. We went from a world where things were crafted to a world where things are manufactured and installed. Buildings are made mainly of commoditized parts and materials today which makes a lot of things look simplistic and similar. This is good in many ways because when a craftsman was hand carving things they were not very productive and it cost a lot of money. Today, a worker is amazingly productive since their tools are powered and their materials are pre-fabricated and just need to be cut to size. Lastly, buildings are far more complex today than 100+ years ago. Lots more electrical and plumbing, complex HVAC, insulation requirements, etc. These things were not considered long ago. You had carpentry and maybe a bit of plumbing and some basic electrical. You can still get really nice custom work done and it's unbelievable expensive. reply nextworddev 19 hours agoparentprevIt is much cheaper to build McMansions, etc reply bluGill 18 hours agorootparentMcMansions are also functional.

Basically, the same structural problem that plagues nuclear power plant construction. All those fancy technological advancements did almost nothing to the typical housing construction, it's still a lot of manual work, a lot of specialized tasks (site prep, foundation, frame/structural stuff, roof, insulation, plumbing, sewage, wiring, HVAC, connecting utilities), a ton of waiting, lots of logistics. An enormous amount of babysitting (project management) of the builders, because everything is basically custom/one-off. https://www.construction-physics.com/p/which-construction-ta... cheaper https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-are-there-so-few-... scale https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innov... reply hannasanarion 17 hours agorootparentprevThere's a lot of costs that go into construction, the actual expense of putting together the parts to make the thing was at one time the biggest one, but not any more. With all those new technologies that increase the efficiency of buildings and construction come technicians who expect to be paid well for their expertise, so for every manual job removed there's an expert who needs to be paid about as much or more to operate or plan the labor-saving technology so implementing the technology may not actually reduce the cost to the builder at all. For the parts that do still require manual labor, that's been getting a lot more expensive and hard to find, because hand-in-hand with people specializing in all these fancy new technologies, the appetite for manual labor employment in developed economies has fallen, which pushes up the cost of the parts of construction that technologies hasn't changed. Regulations and requirements have also massively proliferated in the last century. The number of inspections and approvals that any piece of construction needs is pretty crazy compared to the prewar era, plus new requirements and design limitations set by law that, while good for society (anti-fire, disability access), can sometimes drive up costs or limit design choices because ramps take more space than stairs and fire sprinklers represent a doubling of the amount of plumbing work you need to do. Land has gotten progressively more expensive as it has become more scarce. Sprawl kinda reached the limit of what commuters are willing to tolerate in the 90s, so nobody can do cheap greenfill development anymore (anecdote, my parents had a new house built on the outskirts of Phoenix in 2006, with a 70 minute minimum driving commute, which I would absofuckinglutely never tolerate for myself): you need to buy more expensive interior land to redevelop. God help you if your local land use regulations require you to provide free parking, in which case you may be forbidden from building on as much as 2/3 of that very expensive land you just bought. reply spaniard89277 19 hours agorootparentprevWe can do that. But we can't make new space. reply pegasus 19 hours agorootparentIf the footprint is so expensive, you'd expect more investment in building quality, not less. reply hannasanarion 17 hours agorootparentBecause the footprint is so expensive, you don't have the cash to invest in quality without making the building too expensive for the people who are going to be using it. And the footprint isn't the only thing that's more expensive, all the cool new technologies that your grandparent comment brought up are all more expensive to implement than structures without them. The existence of those technologies implies the existence of skilled professionals to plan and install them. It used to be that you just needed to pay your architect and engineer and builders, now you gotta also pay your crane operators and electricians and plumbers and acoustic consultants, and fire protection experts, and geologists, and network engineers, and energy consultants, and accessibility consultants too and they all want to be paid well for their expertise. The proliferation of skilled professionals reduces the appetite in the population in general for unskilled manual labor, so that gets more scarce and expensive too. Gotta pay the builders well or else they'll quit and change careers to be one of those professional types. Add to that the regulatory and compliance requirements that raises the floor of acceptable quality (building MUST be energy efficient, accessible, fire-safe, earthquake-safe, minimally ecologically impactful, etc etc etc) and your wiggle room for where to focus your \"quality\" budget is pretty tiny and exterior aesthetics rapidly sinks to the bottom of that list. [disclaimer: I actually disagree with the people who say that new buildings are ugly.

Colleges, especially large ones, do have tons of students of different faiths, but I felt contacts were still minimal. My randomly-assigned freshman year room-mate was a devout Christian and would sing in worship - super wonderful guy. But after that, not much. It's so easy to just hang out with people similar to you - at all stages of life.

Gaudi himself was deeply religious; this wasn't just the church commissioning a famous architect for the sake of it or anything. It was very much a labour of love for him, AIUI. reply Tabular-Iceberg 17 hours agorootparentI can’t see it in the interior shots. It’s possible that it’s all there but drowned out by bad HDR photography, so I will have to take a look for myself. Also I’m not sure if it’s really Gaudí’s work, for example how the altar is way forward is an innovation from the 1970s. reply simonklitj 18 hours agorootparentprevThis is an interesting comment to me! How do you define secular-looking? Is it a lack of some particular design element? reply Tabular-Iceberg 17 hours agorootparentIt simply lacks Catholic design elements. The stained glass is a jumble of nonsense, not even a nice pattern like the Muslims do, and I suppose there is an altar and a crucifix in there somewhere, but they drown in all the visual clutter, like they’re ashamed of it. It’s possible, even likely, that the pictures don’t do it justice, so I will take a look in person at some point, but I don’t have high hopes. reply fvdessen 14 hours agorootparentThe whole church is completely covered in innumerable fractals of catholic symbolism and its main tower will be topped by a 29 meters high cross. Maybe you just don't like the style, which is understandable as it is quite divisive. reply AlanYx 16 hours agorootparentprevThere's a rhyme and reason to the stained glass that's tied into the other symbolic elements embedded in the architecture. For example, the color scheme shifts as you pan from the nativity side through to the passion side. The lower panels are not totally abstract; there are vague shapes that sort of remind you of figures, flames, etc. but then it tends to pivot towards full geometric abstraction as you raise your head. Like the Mezquita in Córdoba, it's hard to get a sense of how intensely all the combined elements make an impression just from photographs. reply weatherlight 19 hours agoparentprev#notacathedral reply dncornholio 20 hours agoparentprevI had the same type of feeling. Sagrada felt more like a zoo / tourist attraction then an actual religious building. The design is impressive but it didn't bring the uumpf that Duomo did. reply tgv 19 hours agorootparentBecause it's so crowded, I guess. It's a nice place, especially the exterior and the workshops. The interior feels too bland. Milan's Dom isn't that impressive to me, but perhaps that's because I've seen more grand, old churches, and the Sagrada Familia felt like something different. reply azulster 18 hours agorootparentprevironically i had the same feeling when i visited the vatican, and they were holding mass while i was visiting! tourist attraction is always gonna feel like a tourist attraction i guess reply chrisdroukas 20 hours agoprevThere are a number of material and technology advances [1] that accelerated the pace of the Sagrada Familia's construction — the techniques used to construct the basilica have evolved significantly since construction began. https://www.archdaily.com/964178/from-handcrafted-stone-to-3... reply hn_throwaway_99 20 hours agoparentI should most definitely hope so considering construction started in 1882. reply weatherlight 20 hours agoprevI live here in Barcelona, it's a sight to behold :) It's minor basilica, not a cathedral though, reply iambateman 18 hours agoprevOn a perfect afternoon in September, I walked alone through the park to find the church. One moment, only trees. The next, La Sagrada Familia. To stand there, before the century of brilliance and determination that combined to create this mass of stone and glass, on the edge between nature and society, and see, and sense that I too am seen, was one of the great privileges of my life. To Gaudí, and his countless collaborators…thank you. reply martibravo 20 hours agoprevIt won't. Gaudí's plan was to build a big staircase in front of it creating a new public square next to the temple, replacing some apartment buildings currently being used. Gaudí's project won't be finished until then. There's some pushback from the neighbors because finishing it all means bulldozing hundreds of apartments, although those apartments were bought at a discounted price decades ago because everyone knew they had an expiration date. And now that it's here, they want to keep their apartments even though they were told about the Sagrada Família from the start. PS: Gaudí's name is Antoni, in Catalan. Not Antonio. He was a proud Catalan, he was arrested for talking in Catalan. reply lqet 20 hours agoparent> Gaudí's plan It is incredibly rare for a large cathedral to be completed just like the original architect envisioned it, without any compromises made along the way*. It may even be said that a large cathedral is never finished - all the large cathedrals have a standing team of builders, usually with a tradition going back to the middle ages, and require constant maintenance work. \"Finished\" is thus a difficult term for such a building. But if major construction will stop in 2026, with the building no longer having any obvious large missing parts, I am totally fine with calling it \"finished\", even if the original plans were different. My understanding is that they already deviated from the original plans decades ago. * I think Cologne cathedral was completed more or less according to the original plan, but only because historism was en vogue and they found the original medieval plans by chance in the 19th century. Strasbourg cathedral is a good example for a cathedral which doesn't look at all like the original architect envisioned it, with a long history of re-planning and some aesthetically botched construction works. reply diggan 20 hours agorootparent> My understanding is that they already deviated from the original plans decades ago. Yes, a lot of models and plans Gaudi created for Sagrada Familia were incomplete when he died. It didn't help either that his studio(s) were ransacked during the civil war, so even if he had a 100% vision, the war would ensure those plans didn't survive. reply ddalex 19 hours agorootparentprev> \"found\" the original medieval plans \"by chance\" reply simonbarker87 20 hours agoparentprev> There's some pushback Quite understandable as well. The thing is big enough as it is. Bought at a discount or not, bulldozing that many homes in an overpopulated city that already struggles for space due to its geography is a little ludicrous. reply martibravo 20 hours agorootparentAs someone from Barcelona, I really wanna see it finished completely. Those apartments had an expiration date the moment they were built in the 60s. Everyone who bought them at a discount knew that they were going to be torn down when the temple itself was finished. I feel it's like those people that buy a house near an airport, they pay pennies for it, and then start lobbying the government for a change in air traffic routes. reply unglaublich 20 hours agorootparentExactly. Nimbyism at its finest: all gains are mine; all losses should be covered. It's bizarre that at the same time, real estate investors think all value increases are rightfully theirs, but they should be protected from any decrease in value. You can hardly call it 'investing' if you're protected from the downsides. reply bjackman 19 hours agorootparentI don't oppose destruction of housing because of people losing their investment - expropriate it for all I care. But reducing the housing supply is bad for everyone. That's the important problem with nimbyism: it's not that it demands unfair advantages for homeowners as investors, it's that it prevents development that is needed for a better world. There's definitely an argument to be made that globally iconic feats of architecture have intrinsic value that's more important than a bit of housing. But you do need to account for the social impact of aggravating housing scarcity to make that argument. reply bluGill 17 hours agorootparentWe need to build more housing, but that doesn't mean we need to keep existing housing. Most old buildings should be replaced - they were not built with modern codes in mind and so are expensive to heat, dangerous in fire, have not accessible bathrooms, or other such things wrong that are difficult to correct. reply ossobuco 19 hours agorootparentprev> Nimbyism at its finest: all gains are mine; all losses should be covered Nimbyims? This is corporate capitalism at its finest. Private profits, socialized and externalized losses. reply seanalltogether 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the Glory facade needs an approach. It can't simply dump out onto the street. reply diggan 19 hours agorootparentprev> bulldozing that many homes in an overpopulated city As far as I understand, only one building (many flats though) would have to be removed in order to fit the staircase. Problem is that there isn't a lot of space available to put the people whose home you just removed, so seems unlikely to happen unless our local government suddenly solves some really hard problems. reply xyzelement 19 hours agorootparentprevIf this logic holds, then we should be open to bulldoze the Sagrada Familia itself to make more apartments. reply martibravo 19 hours agorootparentSagrat Habitatge (Holy Accommodation in Catalan) reply wouldbecouldbe 20 hours agorootparentprevModern Architecture is ludicrous. We build and build depressing neighborhoods in cities for us to all flee to historical centres to experience beauty for a minute. I mean if you are in the US you are lost anyway, but the Europe has some beautiful cities (Amsterdam, Venice, Palma, Rome, Vienna the list continues), but none of them are modern. The citizens should be helped to find replacement, but please let's put some beauty back in our cities and give prominence to Gaudi's architecture (although maybe it's not the prettiest it's at least fun) reply EdiX 20 hours agorootparentIronically the Sagrada Familia is an example of modern architecture. reply wouldbecouldbe 12 hours agorootparentYeah modern in the historic classification of the term, not in the way of speaking. Most people normally consider modern housing last decades. Lots of building up untill the second world ware are gorgous, but not considered modern by most people. For instance Berlage in Amsterdam is modern in your classifcation. And his buildings grace Amsterdam, but most people would consider them \"older\", he was living around the same time of Gaudi. https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Petrus_Berlage reply pixl97 10 hours agorootparent>Lots of building up untill the second world ware are gorgous I think you may have severely underestimated the population growth and need for housing after WWII. The world had not seen population growth like that before. The US and Europe cast away their ornate designs and focused on a burgeoning population in the US and rebuilding quickly in Europe. reply wouldbecouldbe 2 minutes agorootparentI'm mostly stating an observation. But even so, that excuse would not hold up for the last decades. Architects still keep going to produce hideous things; and not at all being introspective about it. Let alone Canada & Northern US, they combine it with a terrible city planning strategy. Calgary must the most depressive unlivable city I've ever visited. Even everything produced last decade is either boring and uninspiring for instance:https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2GMG3GJ/new-modern-apartment-block..., or has to be weird and original in the \"brand\" of the Architect (for instance Rem Koolhaas). martibravo 19 hours agorootparentprevYes, Catalan modernism is relatively modern.

I just took a look now and there are at least 90 apartments available on Idealista for rent in just the ~3 surrounding blocks around Sagrada Familia. So while in general the whole \"touristic flat rentals\" stuff is clearly hurting the city, maybe over-dramatizing the impact isn't super useful. Overall the situation sucks though, as prices seems to still go up :/ reply martibravo 19 hours agorootparentThat's a whole other thread. The new Rent Control law has hurt (a lot) long-term rental for locals and long-term residents. All offers on Idealista and other portals are for contracts of up to 12 months, short term rentals under Spanish Law. Those are not rent-controlled contracts. In my part of Eixample there aren't any long term units available. reply diggan 19 hours agorootparentIgnore what it says in the listings, even if they say \"maximum 11 months contract\", once you speak with them and indicate you know the situation and regulations, they'll be open to sign proper contracts, unless the owner is a huge asshole (which, many are, sadly).

    "title": "ZenHammer: AMD Zen platforms vulnerable to Rowhammer",
    "originLink": "https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/zenhammer/",
    "originBody": "ZenHammer: Rowhammer Attacks on AMD Zen-based Platforms Our work shows that it is possible to trigger Rowhammer bit flips on DDR4 devices on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems despite deployed TRR mitigations. This result proves that AMD systems are equally vulnerable to Rowhammer as Intel systems, which greatly increases the attack surface, considering today’s AMD market share of around 36% on x86 desktop CPUs. This poses a significant risk as DRAM devices in the wild cannot easily be fixed, and previous work showed that Rowhammer attacks are practical, for example, in the browser, on smartphones, across VMs, and even over the network. Furthermore, we show that ZenHammer can trigger Rowhammer bit flips on a DDR5 device for the first time. Our results show a high number of bit flips on Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems. Also, devices are more vulnerable on Zen 3 than Coffee Lake, simplifying exploitation. We can build the page table, RSA public key corruption, and sudo exploits from prior work on 7/6/4 of these devices, taking, on average, just 164/267/209 seconds. How did you do it? We reverse-engineered the secret DRAM address functions by adopting the DRAMA technique for AMD systems. We found that the timing routine must be changed for more reliable results. We make the key observation that a physical offset must be applied to physical addresses before recovering the DRAM address functions due to system address remapping (see Figure 1). This allows us to recover the address functions completely. However, using these address functions gives us very few bit flips on 5 and 0 of 10 devices on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3, respectively, as we show in Table 1. Fig. 1: Remapping of higher address ranges to unused parts of physical memory on Intel and AMD CPUs. The Top of Memory (TOM) is the system’s highest addressable memory location. Table 1: Result of running Blacksmith on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems, compared to our Intel Coffee Lake baseline. We report for each device the number of patterns found (|P+|) and the number of bit flips over all patterns (|F_fuzz|). We omit devices without any bit flips. We started by looking at the refresh synchronization, which previous work (e.g., SMASH, Blacksmith) showed to be important for triggering bit flips. We demonstrate that continuous timing measurements using non-repeating rows are effective for precise and reliable refresh synchronization on AMD. The result in Listing 1 shows our improved refresh synchronization method.Listing 1. Our continuous, non-repeating refresh synchronization. We found out that the activation rate of non-uniform Rowhammer patterns on AMD Zen+/3 systems is significantly lower than on Intel Coffee Lake (see Figure 2). To investigate this, we conducted a series of experiments to find the optimal hammering instruction sequence. Our results showed that regular loads (MOV) with CLFLUSHOPT for flushing aggressors from the cache, issued immediately after accessing an aggressor (“scatter” style), is optimal. It further revealed that, unlike on Zen 2, explicit fencing after flushing is not required on Zen 3. Fig. 2: Distribution of the activation rates of non-uniform hammering patterns on Z+, Z3, and Intel Coffee Lake (CL). The whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values. We further investigated how different fence types and fence scheduling policies affect Rowhammer patterns on AMD Zen systems. For this, we came up with six different pattern-aware and cache-avoiding fence scheduling policies (see Table 2) and tested them on our devices for 6 hours each to determine the device’s optimal policy. We found that on most devices on Zen 2 the policy SP_none is optimal while SP_pair is in most cases better suited on Zen 3. Table 2: Overview of our proposed fence scheduling policies. We indicate which policies are pattern-aware by taking the pattern’s structure into account and which are cache-avoiding. How bad is it? For our evaluation, we considered a test pool of 10x DDR4 DRAM devices covering the three major manufacturers (Samsung, Micron, SK Hynix). We let our ZenHammer fuzzer run for 3 hours with each fence type (mfence, sfence) and fence scheduling policy. After each run, the best pattern is determined by using a minisweep over 4 MiB with all found patterns. Thereafter, we swept the best pattern of the best policy over a contiguous memory area of 256 MB and reported the number of bit flips. The results in Table 3 show that our ZenHammer fuzzer is able to trigger bit flips on 7 (Zen 2) and 6 (Zen 3) of 10 DDR4 DRAM devices. Table 3: ZenHammer results on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 as well as Intel Coffee Lake. For each of our devices, we report the best scheduling policy (SP_opt) and both the number of effective patterns (|P+|) and bit flips (|F_fuzz|) we found while fuzzing with the best policy. We also show the number of bit flips found when sweeping the best patterns over a 256 MiB range (|F_swp|). We evaluated the exploitability of these bit flips based on three attacks from previous work: (i) an attack targeting the page frame number of a page table entry (PTE) to pivot it to an attacker-controlled page table page, (ii) an attack on the RSA-2048 public key that allows recovering the associated private key used to authenticate to an SSH host, (iii) and an attack on the password verification logic of the sudoers.so library that enables gaining root privileges. We report the results in Table 4. Table 4: Analysis of the bit flip exploitability found during the sweep over 256 MiB on AMD Zen 2, Zen 3, and Intel Coffee Lake. For each attack, we indicate the number of exploitable bit flips (#Ex.) and the average time to find an exploitable bit flip (Time). We mark DIMMs with a single exploitable bit flip by (*). We omit DIMMs without any exploitable bit flips. What about DDR5? Finally, we tried ZenHammer on DDR5 by reverse engineering the DRAM functions on AMD Zen 4 and evaluating ten DDR5 devices. Out of these ten devices, ZenHammer could trigger ~42k flips on one device. This is the first public report of DDR5 bit flips on commodity systems in the wild. However, given that ZenHammer could not trigger flips on nine out of ten devices, we conclude that more research is necessary to find more effective patterns for DDR5 devices. Further Information For full details and more information about our work, please have a look at our paper, which is to appear at USENIX Security 2024 in August 2024. Our ZenHammer fuzzer is available on Github. FAQs Following, we provide answers to the most frequently asked questions about our work. Why has nobody paid any attention to AMD systems before? We believe that AMD received little attention as the original work on Rowhammer by Kim et al. showed a much higher number of bit flips on Intel systems and subsequent work also focused primarily on Intel. Further, there is much more known about the microarchitecture of Intel CPUs compared to AMD CPUs. Are there any DDR4 devices that are safe? Not likely. We could not trigger any bit flips on 3 and 4 of our 10 devices on Zen 2 and Zen 3, respectively. However, given that we triggered only a few bit flips on them on Intel Coffee Lake as well, we think that tuning the fuzzer further may expose bit flips on these devices too. Why does your evaluation consider ten devices only? Because we have a limited number of AMD Zen 2/3 machines in our lab and some of our experiments took a long time, we have decided to reduce the number of devices to ten. We made sure that our randomly chosen subset includes devices from all three major DRAM vendors. How can I check whether my DRAM is vulnerable? The code of our ZenHammer fuzzer, which you can use to assess your DRAM device for bit flips on AMD Zen 2/3/4 CPUs, is available on GitHub. Why has JEDEC not fixed this issue yet? By now we know, thanks to a better understanding, that solving Rowhammer is hard but not impossible, as we show in our previous work ProTRR and REGA. We believe that there is a lot of bureaucracy inside JEDEC that makes it difficult to properly address Rowhammer. What about DIMMs with Error Correction Codes (ECC)? Previous work on DDR3 showed that ECC cannot provide protection against Rowhammer. Due to the even larger number of bit flips in current DDR4 devices, we believe that ECC cannot provide complete protection against Rowhammer but just makes exploitation harder. What if my system runs with a double refresh rate? Besides an increased performance overhead and power consumption, previous work (e.g., Mutlu et al. and Frigo et al.) showed that doubling the refresh rate is a weak solution not providing complete protection. Responsible Disclosure Rowhammer is a known industry-wide issue, and we did not see a need to go through the typical disclosure process. Nonetheless, we informed AMD on February 26, 2024, and at their request, we did not publicly disclose the issue until March 25, 2024. This page was briefly online by mistake on March 21.

ECC remains a highly effective method for turning this from a security issue to a reliability issue, mostly. As an individual owner of a server, if that server has ECC and you expect to notice machine halts due to uncorrectable ECC errors, the security implications for you are modest. Now, if you are a cloud provider that provides VMs on multitenant hosts, your threat model may be different. Either way, avoid machines without ECC. TRR was a lame duck even when Rowhammer was still fresh, and bits flipping in DRAM will not go away unless the economics in DRAM manufacturing change (e.g. not). reply Arnavion 11 hours agoparentI would use ECC memory if I could. I used to use a TR 2920x with ECC but now I'm on a Ryzen 7950x with non-ECC. Unbuffered ECC memory is the only one supported by Ryzen, and it's slower or more expensive or both compared to the equivalent-capacity non-ECC memory. The latest Threadripper lineup supports Registered ECC, but Threadripper is overkill (cost, threads, PCIe lanes) for home users like myself. reply justinclift 10 hours agorootparent> and it's slower or more expensive or both compared to the equivalent-capacity non-ECC memory. That's not anything new though. My local supplier (https://www.scorptec.com.au) has a fair amount of both, with ECC currently being about double the price (ugh).

The last time I have looked ECC DDR5 UDIMM modules had a price higher by at most 50%. Nevertheless that is still excessively high. While in the beginning for DDR5 there were only 80-bit modules, which could claim a +25% higher price, now there are 72-bit modules, like in the previous generations, which can justify at most a +12.5% price increase. reply Dylan16807 2 hours agorootparentI looked right when I posted that and found 2x32GB non-ECC 5600MHz for $165, exactly half the $330 price of the sticks listed in the post. I spent several minutes looking for cheaper ECC at the same specs and couldn't find any. Trying again, I can find some Kingston sticks that are $120 each, so that's about 50% higher. Amazon's search is really bad, by the way. But that's not the \"at most\" price. And a month ago they were $140 each. Also the spec sheet says they are 72 bit modules made out of 20 2GB x8 chips? That is baffling. Is 10% of the memory going unused? https://www.kingston.com/datasheets/KSM56E46BD8KM-32HA.pdf Edit: Micron data sheets suggest that UDIMMs have 2x13 command/address pins and RDIMMs have 2x6, so that's one piece of the puzzle. Apparently UDIMMs can do x64 and x72, and RDIMMs can do x72 and x80. reply adrian_b 1 hour agorootparentWhen DDR5 was first introduced, there were only x8 chips. Because the DDR5 channels must have a width of 32, 36 or 40 bits, with x8 chips one had to use 40-bit channels, even if only 36-bit channels are needed, so indeed 10% of the memory capacity remained unused. Meanwhile, about a year ago, at least Micron has also introduced x4 chips. There are such ECC UDIMMs, using both x8 and x4 chips, which waste no memory. On the market there are both modules made only with x8 chips, which do not use a part of the memory, and modules with a combination of x8 and x4 chips, without unused memory. reply foresto 2 hours agorootparentprevAll the Ryzen 7000 series desktop processors support ECC, I think. Check each model's specs to be sure. Asus motherboards for those CPUs also support it, as stated in the BIOS manuals I looked over. It requires changing the BIOS ECC setting from Auto to Enable. I have done this on one such system, and the appropriate EDAC messages showed up in the Linux boot log. reply wtallis 12 hours agorootparentprevIs that a change? I think what you described applies equally to every generation of Zen processors: Pro-branded chips have ECC capability officially, laptop chips don't have it, and consumer-branded chips have it unofficially with ECC capability optional for motherboards. reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentAlready since a few generations, at least since Zen 3, the desktop Ryzen CPU have official ECC support, not unofficial ECC support like the first Ryzen. This can be verified easily on the AMD site by reading the CPU specifications. For laptop CPUs, there has been a time interval between the beginning of 2022 and the autumn of 2023 when ECC support was specified for all mobile Rembrandt and Phoenix CPUs, but then the ECC support has been removed suddenly from the specifications of all non-Pro laptop CPUs. reply dralley 11 hours agorootparentprevIs it disabled or is it simply not certified? Last I checked ECC was not certified to work on most \"consumer\" oriented hardware, but AMD didn't make any attempt to actually disable it. reply mjevans 10 hours agorootparentLast I checked, DESKTOP AMD CPUs have working (not disabled, but not 'supported') ECC with DDR5 UDIMMs (5v source, not 12v server ram). Desktop BOARDS, depends on the HW + BIOS; initial firmware revisions didn't do ECC but for many boards on some brands it does work. I haven't checked recently. reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentNo longer true. At least since Zen 3 (2020), all AMD desktop Ryzen CPUs have ECC support clearly included in their specifications, so it is official support, not just a non-disabled ECC. This change was around the same time when Intel has begun to support ECC in some Alder Lake desktop CPUs (and in their successors), so it might have been a response to Intel's decision. So now the ECC support depends strictly on the motherboard manufacturer. The best chance to find motherboards with ECC support is at ASUS and at ASRock (including ASRock Rack, which offers server boards for Ryzen CPUs). reply cbozeman 5 hours agoparentprev> bits flipping in DRAM will not go away unless the economics in DRAM manufacturing change This seems like all the argument necessary to require all computers - and I do mean all computers - to require ECC memory. The security risk is simply too great, and everything is too integrated not to make this change. Even a \"gamer\" on a pure gaming computer will have some crucial information on that machine, so I simply do not see how we've gone this far without making this change. reply tdullien 2 hours agorootparentThe reality is that Rowhammer remains one of the hardest ways to compromise a machine, largely because the software stack most people are running isn't great. reply c2h5oh 12 hours agoparentprevI would expect that increased crash rate of multi-tenant hosts would be something that would be detected and investigated by the cloud provider.

Previous work on DDR3 showed that ECC cannot provide protection against Rowhammer. This is incredibly misleading. The paper they cite states: When the ECC detection is used correctly 0.65%-7.42% of all bit flips still cause silent corruptions... On setup AMD-1, uncorrectable errors crash the system. The attacker will need to cause dozens of machine halts in order to achieve even a single exploitable bitflip. Dozens of machine halts is not something that goes undetected. Kudos for calling out JEDEC's terrible behavior on the rowhammer question, but we should not be downplaying ECC as a near-term solution. reply wolpoli 11 hours agoparent> The attacker will need to cause dozens of machine halts in order to achieve even a single exploitable bitflip. Dozens of machine halts is not something that goes undetected. Is there a process for the operations team managing the system to figure out that it was an attack and not just flaky hardware? reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentMemory bit flips are very rare. Normally a memory error does not happen more than a few times per year, unless you have a huge amount of memory. Therefore when 2 memory correctable or uncorrectable errors happen in the same day, that should be enough to trigger an immediate report to the user or administrator of the computer that either there is an ongoing RowHammer attack that must be stopped or one of the memory modules is approaching its end-of-life due to aging and it must be replaced before it will begin to have very frequent memory errors. At least on server computers it should be easy to configure their logging system so that a second memory error per day, even if it was correctable, should immediately send an e-mail message and/or an SMS to the administrator. reply wolpoli 1 hour agorootparentIf that's the case, then I guess they would take physical server offline. And if other machines started showing similar signs of failure, then they would analyze the logs for possible row hammer attack? reply crotchfire 9 hours agorootparentprevSure: you replace the hardware with brand new hardware and it keeps happening.

Rowhammer and speculative execution attacks are incredibly labor-intensive and target-specific.

Among consumer products, some AMD desktop CPUs and motherboards support ECC memory, and that's about it. reply justinclift 9 hours agorootparentFor desktops, ASRock motherboards seem to be the common choice for people wanting ECC memory.

The ASRock Taichi for example does not have any ECC DIMMs in its \"qualified\" list. reply justinclift 8 hours agorootparentInteresting. Might be good for someone (not me!) to investigate then write in-depth info about. :) As a data point, I'm using a previous generation ASRock AM4 motherboard with ECC and that definitely works. I'm undervolting my cpu and ram, and very occasionally (every 6 months or so?) one of those seems to be generating a correctable ECC error that gets propagated to warning messages on my terminal. Haven't bothered investigating any further though. ;) reply jquery 10 hours agoparentprevThanks for this.

This is not a silent attack. This is a proof that ECC is a penetrable defense. Which we all know! The question is how difficult it is and how stealthily it can be done. But regardless, ECC still sounds the alarm when it's being attacked. If no one listens, there's not much ECC can do about that. reply rightbyte 12 hours agorootparentprevThat's true for encryption too. reply YetAnotherNick 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can cause any amount of single and double flip without worry.

Is this one of the many inevitable vulnerabilities that arise from CPU optimization and are of little feasibility in the real world? reply rocqua 11 hours agoparentArguably worse. This arises from the physics of DRAM. This occurs at a much lower level than an edge case of a feature that lets you leak info over a side channel. Instead this is just: the data is stored as a small charge in a grid by flipping nearby points on the grid alot you can leak some charge into your target charge. The smaller the charge, and the closer together the charges, the easier rowhammer attacks are. Also, the smaller and closer together the charges, the faster, cheaper, denser, and efficient your RAM gets. There are mitigations, but they are pushed to the limit. reply KennyBlanken 8 hours agorootparentFrom what I understand, it arises from DRAM manufacturers, interested in maximizing profits as much as possible, have been pushing the limits of how small they can make the RAM chip's features, and then backing off slightly until they felt ram was reliable \"enough\", but Rowhammer et al demonstrate it's very easy to cause bit flipping? reply rocqua 3 hours agorootparentThey push the size to the limit, and stop when random writing is unlikely to cause any bitflips. Stopping at the point rowhammer would be unlikely would be stopping earlier. As others said, this isn't just about profits.

I feel like I just went through a 101 EE course. I had NO idea any of this was related to the actual hardware manufacturing imperfections, etc. That explains the name Rowhammer. I've probably been under a rock and everyones knows this stuff. > Due to the extreme density of modern DRAM arrays, small manufacturing imperfections can cause weak electrical coupling between neighboring cells. This, combined with the minuscule capacitance of such cells, means that every time a DRAM row is read from a bank, the memory cells in adjacent rows leak a small amount of charge. If this happens frequently enough between two refresh cycles, the affected cells can leak enough charge that their stored bit value will “flip”, a phenomenon known as “disturbance error” or more recently as Rowhammer. reply KennyBlanken 8 hours agoparent> Due to the extreme density of modern DRAM arrays, small manufacturing imperfections can cause weak electrical coupling between neighboring cells. This makes it sound like it's unavoidable and inherent to making DRAM. It isn't. DRAM manufacturers have been pushing the limits to an extreme. That's why. Pursuit of profit.

Facebook groups, discord rooms, reddit subs and the likes just aren't the same, they all feel so impersonal and detached, in some people compete for internet points, in others everything is ephemeral and closed off ... Maybe it's just nostalgia / me being old. reply joemi 14 hours agorootparent> Facebook groups, discord rooms, reddit subs and the likes just aren't the same I think it depends on which ones you're using. There are some facebook groups and subreddits I use that still feel very much like a small-forum, where people are generally good and helpful and many of the users are regulars. I haven't seen any discord rooms like that except for some ones that are direct spinoffs of the facebook groups and subreddits I mentioned, so that seems more like a credit to the users than the medium. I think they have to be pretty niche, though. But to be fair, forums of the old internet also had similar issues where once they reached a certain size the experience was different/worse than when they were smaller. reply samstave 15 hours agorootparentprevSam's Law: \"As an idea or subject gains wider popularity and interest, the level of passion and laser focus on the _outcomes_ of the idea or subject gets diluted to the average level of understanding of the interested audience for the core subject\" (my weak attempt at describing this issue) reply rrr_oh_man 13 hours agorootparentThe Peter Principle of communities: They grow until they become useless. reply samstave 13 hours agorootparentPetering out, as it were :-) reply chambored 16 hours agorootparentprevI've zipped it up and sent a link. reply xnx 18 hours agoprevThis reminds me of the PageSpeed modules for Apache and Nginx https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module reply me_bx 14 hours agoparentI believe the project is not maintained anymore.

I was talking in context of variable fonts which come with lots of features mapped to opentype tags and axes. font-feature-settings property selects (or activates) those features. Usually this is done at few CSS selector levels. The variable fonts can be trimmed by freezing those features. I did something like this with Fira Code a few years ago.

It's definitely bumping my excitement towards subset fonts! reply kibwen 17 hours agoprevI'm interested in the notion of identifying \"critical\" CSS that should be inlined rather than live in its own stylesheet. I was hoping there was some principled way of identifying critical and non-critical CSS (e.g. user interaction effects like :hover would always be considered non-critical), but it looks like the library it's using just tries to render your page and do a best-effort detection on which rules are considered critical, which IMO is a little unsatisfying: https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters reply chrismorgan 14 hours agoparentIf you have less than 50KB of CSS, inline it. (And if you have more than 50KB of CSS, you’re probably doing it wrong. Well, OK, maybe you’re inlining fonts too, that’s understandable. But if you have more than 50KB of other styles, you’re probably doing it wrong.) Seriously, inlining is absurdly good for performance, even compared with a warm cache, and the threshold where external stylesheets or scripts perform better is surprisingly high, into the hundreds of kilobytes for some common markets. The notion of critical CSS… it’s a defeatist attitude, trying to grasp back some squandered performance, rather than fixing the underlying problem. I regret to say this is just based on casual experience and observation, not any methodical technique. I would really like someone to run with this concept and measure it more fully.

But it looks like the CSS improvements actually did help. It looks like a great idea and would probably help if I had any images in my project. reply georges_gomes 16 hours agoparentHi! It's true that it you don't have images, the benefits are limited. Also, your CSS may become bigger at the end because we automatically improve compatibility with browser. You can disable this by setting browserlist to empty string. https://jampack.divriots.com/features/browser-compatibility/ reply rkagerer 15 hours agoprevThis looks great! Although personally I hate it when I scroll a page beyond the 'fold' and have to wait for images to load. By default, does this load the remaining below-the-fold content in the background once the above-the-fold stuff is complete? reply lelandfe 15 hours agoparentIt does not. It leverages native lazy loading. All major browsers treat a `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute as meaning \"do not load this image/iframe until it is nearly in view.\" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/im... However, this does inline aspect ratios, so the layout won't change after they're done loading - the cardinal sin of lazy loading. reply rkagerer 13 hours agorootparentThanks. 10+ years ago I wrote a GreaseMonkey userscript for a dating site that collected all your results into one scrollable table. It exercised very explicit control over the image loading sequence. If I recall (and my memory might be spotty), it grabbed 1 thumbnail image per match initially, in the order they were displayed, to populate the table. Once all the thumbnails were pulled (which didn't take very long), it would start downloading full sized images, in the background. Hovering a match to view more details would immediately prioritize that matches photos, and if you hovered over one of said match's photo thumbnails (as if to click) that specific image would be placed at the top of the queue. It was all done using Javascript (no frameworks) and XmlHttpRequest, and worked pretty well. This was back when servers only allowed you a couple (or handful) of connections at a time. I wrote a \"TaskQueue\" class in Javascript implementing a very simple form of cooperative multitasking (jobs designed to do their work in chunks). Tasks could \"preempt\" others, and you could define simple relationships so a group of tasks could block on one they were dependent on. Funny story, I actually sent a link to the tool to a girl on the site who I eventually wound up in a long-term relationship with (\"here, let me help you make it more efficient to browse for other guys...\"). Anyway, at the time I felt like it was table stakes that a page like this should be able to exert some sensible control over the sequencing and prioritization of its image assets, in a fashion that has the user's best interests at heart. I'm glad browsers have finally evolved out-of-the-box attributes like \"loading=lazy\", but I kind of wish there were an option between \"eager\" and \"lazy\" that simply deferred the lazy content until all the other content is done. So I can still walk away to get a coffee (or switch to another tab) and come back to a fully, instantly-responsive page. reply lelandfe 13 hours agorootparentGreat story. > Once all the thumbnails were pulled... it would start downloading full sized images LQIP, Low-Quality Image Placeholder – that was pretty new stuff circa 2014.

There is currently no way to change this behavior but I could add an option that would preload the below-the-fold images in the background when all the page is loaded. It's actually a pretty nice idea. I'm just afraid it will load unnecessary images at the bottom of the page but if it's an option, anybody can choose to have it or not! reply dan_can_code 18 hours agoprevThis is great!

    "title": "Maximizing Code Clarity: esbuild and Redis Documentation",
    "originLink": "https://johnjago.com/great-docs/",
    "originBody": "esbuild and Redis1 are two examples of codebases with exceptional documentation. Through their READMEs, changelogs, architecture documents, and code comments, both projects explain their design in such a way that someone new to the codebase can understand where things are, how things are done, and why they are done that way. If you’re a developer looking to get better at documenting your code and software architecture, these are great case studies. Why good documentation matters If you’re writing software, good documentation is a necessity, especially if other people will see or contribute to the codebase—or if you yourself plan on coming back later. If you’re only using the software, you almost always could benefit from documentation that is missing, whether it be instructions on how to use it—or an explanation of when you should and shouldn’t use it. If you’re contributing to a codebase, the speed at which you can start effectively contributing is correlated to how good the documentation is, as long as the code itself isn’t convoluted. Whether you’re an author, contributor, or just an end user of the codebase, the quality of the documentation affects your experience, directly or indirectly—so writing good documentation matters. The benefits of good documentation are too many to list. Here are a few that might apply to you. You save time, especially if you’re working with a team. Instead of explaining the entire codebase for an hour to each person who joins your project, though that is beneficial itself in a number of ways, they rather read the documentation ahead of time, resulting in a more productive discussion when you do talk, as it’s not a one-sided conversation. Your open source project is more likely to receive outside contributions and therefore keep existing after you can no longer maintain it. Past decisions that you’re now questioning have been recorded, preventing you from accidentally reintroducing a problem that a past decision helped to resolve. More people can use your application or library, because fewer people have to figure things out for themselves. It helps structure your thinking—and reveal flaws. When writing, you have to explicitly consider and record what you’re thinking, and it brings to light potential problems that you otherwise wouldn’t have noticed. With this in mind, let’s look at and learn from two open source projects that have excellent documentation. esbuild esbuild is a JavaScript bundler created by Evan Wallace. It’s not important for this analysis to know what a bundler is, but webpack has a good explanation if you’re curious. esbuild’s README A project’s README serves as the entry point for a reader of the code. It’s where they get oriented, so it’s important to not overwhelm them with information. Likewise, it’s important to point them to different areas where they can learn more. This README focuses exclusively on the end user of the tool. It first links to major sections in the documentation, such as the getting started section, allowing someone to jump to the topic they’re looking for. The only other section is titled “Why?” and explains briefly why someone would choose this JavaScript bundler over others, with a visualization to help understand the reason. This section also lists the features of the tool, providing an overview of what it does, which helps someone determine if it meets their needs. And that’s it. Starting from here, someone can explore the FAQ, the getting started pages if they wish to use it, the API documentation, or the documentation for a specific feature. It’s hard to get lost. esbuild’s architecture documentation Although the README doesn’t mention the code architecture—its audience is the end user—esbuild is certainly not lacking in architecture documentation. Inside a directory called docs are two files: architecture.md and development.md. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for. We’ll focus on the first file. The document starts with a table of contents to help find things and an introduction which explains the intention of the document. After the short introduction, it talks about the design principles. This is important because it sets the foundation for the decisions that follow. For anything not explicitly explained in the later parts, we wouldn’t be wrong to assume they are a result of these principles, and can infer the reason for an unexplained design choice. Another thing done well is that it’s not all text. There are plenty of graphics to help explain concepts. Below, we see a graphic which shows the different phases of how esbuild bundles JavaScript, including an indication of which steps are done in parallel. Graphs with nodes and edges are useful if the process you’re explaining involves steps that loop back to each other, which can be hard to get across by textual description alone. The visuals mix in code as well, such as in the below example which shows the traversal of the program through code during the tree shaking process. The rest of the architecture documentation for esbuild is similar. It explains a lot in text, but also provides graphics to help visualize complex concepts. Code snippets, tables, and formatting are abundant to aid in reading and understanding how and why things work the way they do. esbuild’s changelog esbuild’s thorough documentation doesn’t stop at the architecture—it extends to the changelog as well. This entry in the changelog has a summary, an extended description, and example code showing the output before and after the change. What’s impressive is that every entry is like this. Detailed explanation2, example code. Someone reading through the changes can understand the impact without referencing the actual code modifications. The result of esbuild’s good documentation It’s not enough that esbuild is a fast JavaScript bundler to win people over. The detailed documentation has no doubt played a role in its growth. At the time of writing, it has 37,000 stars on GitHub and is used by 4.6 million projects. Although Evan is the main contributor by far, there is still no doubt that the documentation has helped get the project to where it is today by serving as a form of thinking—it may be the only way to wrangle such a complex system into one’s head. Redis Redis is an in-memory database. As with esbuild, any more explanation of what Redis does is out of scope for this post, but what is in scope for Redis is the level of detail in the documentation, specifically around its code and architecture. The Redis README: Introduction and architecture The README shares many of the good characteristics of the esbuild README, with a couple differences. First, it’s not short, but that’s okay because the section that introduces Redis is short. The rest of the README is for people contributing to or reading the Redis codebase. This README has a focus on both end users and contributors. For esbuild and Redis, what’s important is that the documentation for both end users and contributors is available—it’s just in different locations. In the section for contributors, the Redis README talks about compiling the Redis source code, fixing common build problems, gotchas with particular operating systems, and running and installing Redis. It covers the basics and highlights common problems, allowing someone to get started and assisting them in not getting stuck soon after. However, the section which really shines is about the Redis internals. This section begins with the layout of the source code, allowing someone new to understand where to find what they’re looking for, and what directories they might be working in most. Then, it talks about key files and their structure. This helps someone understand where the control flow starts. Further down it continues to go over key files, building up an architecture of the program. Unlike esbuild, the description of the architecture is more compact, yet it’s still wonderful to have, as the other option is to read through hundreds of source code files, some with thousands of lines. Code comments in the Redis source Any well-documented codebase usually has good inline documentation in the form of code comments. In the Redis codebase, we see examples like the one below, where multiple paragraphs explain a single line of code, providing valuable context. It’s important to emphasize that long explanations of trivial lines of code are not necessary. If the operation is simple and doesn’t require additional context to understand why it’s done that way, then it’s better to have no comment. A comment which says the same thing as the line of code is unnecessary, unless the line of code is particularly difficult to read (in which case it should probably be refactored), or the intention is to teach. Below we see an example of this, where the line that may be questioned with “why the assertion?” is explained with a comment which assures the reader why it should be correct to assert this. Wrapping up There are many open source projects with great documentation. I decided to showcase these two because I vividly remember that when I first came across them, I thought to myself, “wow, this is some good documentation.” Although time constraints in the moment may not allow for such thorough documentation, what’s hard to see is how much time it saves later on, not just for yourself but for others. Keep that in mind when making the tradeoff. Some projects are purely for fun, or something that only you are working on and you’re not sure if it’s going to go anywhere. In these situations, it’s okay to not document anything. But not documenting anything on a project that many people use or contribute to is something you may want to reconsider. If we’re going by the definition from the Open Source Initiative, with recent license changes to prevent cloud providers from commoditizing Redis, it’s technically not open source anymore, but its code and documentation are still available for anyone to read and contribute to. ↩︎ I understand that programs used in other programs require an increased level of detail in a changelog compared to a consumer product, since critical systems may depend on specific behavior, but in today’s world of “iterate quick”, it’s good to not forget that iterating quick does not mean doing things without thought. Writing changelogs help with that thinking. Recently I’ve seen products that are more on the consumer side releasing detailed changelogs as well. In the linked example, each entry is a long-ish blog post with images, GIFs, and a written explanation of the change. ↩︎",

It looks like it should be good. There is a lot written. However, it's extremely disjointed and unfairlt assumes readers know things. It uses terms not defined yet, or even at all. As a taste, assume you are new to lisp and scheme. Try reading the Chapter 3: Hello Scheme![1] It contains so much mind bogglingly useless information presented in the most obtuse way possible. Okay, you might say, that's the Reference Manual, not the Tutorial[2]. The tutorial is better...except it literally doesn't explain how to run the code. Instead, it tells you to not only to get Emacs, but to also configure it with Geiser. It doesn't show you how to do that. It passes you off to other manuals. Or, to set up Dr. Racket. To be clear, running guile code is as simple as typing 'guile' which starts the interpreter. It's very common for the documentation to hand wave away major ideas by linking elsewhere and assuming that the linked references actually explain things (they rarely do). Anyway, I could go on. It's simply the worst documentation I've seen because it continually leads you to believe it's good. Yet, it rarely delivers the information you need.

It’s one of the main corridors in the area. Thank god it happened in the middle of the night, though that’ll be no consolation to the families of those who may have died. reply TaylorAlexander 1 hour agoprevSomehow I find it surprising how completely the bridge collapsed after the damage. I understand that a container ship collision is serious, but you could imagine a scenarios where the bridge slumps or buckles but doesn’t just disintegrate like that. It’s surprising that ships capable of doing this damage were probably regularly driving past it, and its safety as a thoroughfare depended entirely on those collisions not happening. Does anyone know if modern construction standards would require more stability after a ship collision, or is this still how we build bridges? reply archi42 27 minutes agoparentYou could try to avoid collisions with barriers, or make the bridge fail differently (only a few spans), or make it tolerant to a single support failing. But you need a pretty beefy steel beam to survive a direct hit by... Uh... 200,000t(??) traveling even at a slow jogging pace. (And then it transfers the energy into the rest of the bridge, which will very much not like it). I guess we can be happy failure like this is rare, and that the bridge was not busy: reports indicate 13 cars, and about 7 persons still missing. This could be so much worse. The best way to think about measures is after we know the full chain of events that have lead to this. reply onetimeuse92304 16 minutes agoparentprevMost bridges nowadays (say last century) depend on a careful balance of forces that are transferred through a chain of members in tension and compression. When any piece in the chain of those forces breaks, the entire structure loses ability to transfer forces and breaks. This arrangement is what allows us to build these structures in the first place. There is careful calculations of forces and risks and allowance for margin for error and unexpected events. But, unfortunately, in many cases those do not include ramming things with a large container ship... reply roenxi 5 minutes agorootparentIt is worth observing that this bridge seems to have 2 pylons and one of them collapsed. The failure seems comprehensible after that - you can see in the video how the balances came apart, there is nothing to hold the left side up so it falls and then remainder of the bridge tried to rotate around the remaining pylon and failed. reply armchairdweller 6 minutes agorootparentprevThanks! So why are huge—ass container ships allowed to navigate underneath fragile public bridges with single points of failure? The not unlikely worst case is that the ship is out of control for some reason… reply oliviabenson 0 minutes agorootparentWe notice these type of accidents because they’re so rare. 5k+ people die each year because of large trucks on the road, by comparison, boats and bridges are very safe — that’s why it’s allowed. mkl 59 minutes agoparentprevNot all bridges are this vulnerable to a single impact. This one, opened 12 years earlier, has a different style and mostly survived a cargo ship impact: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Bridge_disaster reply somat 42 minutes agorootparentI would say the damage is about the same, The ship knocked down a pier and all spans connected to the pier went down. The difference is, on the baltimore bridge is that the spans are a lot longer. But all other spans(the ones nearly out of frame) are still standing. reply mkl 36 minutes agorootparentParts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge not connected to the hit pylon went down too. The beam structure above the road that supports the whole thing collapsed and took down other spans. reply whizzter 20 minutes agorootparentAnd that structure probably existed because the bridge has fewer longer spans, probably since the seabed below the bridge is deeper (and needs to be deeper to support container ships passing below). The Öresundsbron (connecting Sweden and Denmark) features both short segments but also with an overhand section in the middle for larger ships to pass through. (1) The great belt bridge (inside Denmark) is slightly higher but has the same kind of profile, one of the largest cruise ships barely making it under it is shown passing in the video below (2). I think the simple truth is that we're vulnerable to these kinds of accidents unless we build far far sturdier bridges, but at these scales to allow passage of ships of these sizes the cost would just make many bridge projects prohibitably expensive. 1: https://www.norden.org/sites/default/files/styles/content_si... 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=j1Cs0C8LkeU reply Symbiote 4 minutes agorootparentThe Øresundsbron is a bridge and a tunnel, and although it's not required most ships choose to cross over the tunnel rather than under the bridge. I was curious about Zealand's other connection, the Great Belt Fixed Link: > The West Bridge has been struck by sea traffic twice. While the link was still under construction on 14 September 1993, the ferry M/F Romsø drifted off course in bad weather and hit the West Bridge. At 19:17 on 3 March 2005, the 3,500-ton freighter MV Karen Danielsen crashed into the West Bridge 800 metres from Funen. All traffic across the bridge was halted, effectively cutting Denmark in two. The bridge was re-opened shortly after midnight, after the freighter was pulled free and inspectors had found no structural damage to the bridge. > The East Bridge has so far been in the clear, although on 16 May 2001, the bridge was closed for 10 minutes as the Cambodian 27,000-ton bulk carrier Bella was heading straight for one of the anchorage structures. The ship was deflected by a swift response from the navy. In Danish [2], but it looks like there's someone always monitoring the sea traffic, and able to close the bridge at very short notice — I assume with the red flashing lights which are used to close motorways in emergencies. > The eastern end through the Great Belt is international water, and therefore even the largest ships must be able to sail under the bridge. The 254 meter high pylons are therefore dimensioned so that they should be able to withstand the approach of tankers of 250,000 tonnes dead weight (DWT) at a speed of 10 knots. Artificial islands protect the anchor blocks as well as the three outermost piers on the Zealand side and the two outermost ones on the Sprogø side.

However the bridge is quite a few times longer than it's trussed section. and none of those spans dropped. reply gonzo41 15 minutes agorootparentprevHobart learned its lesson. You can't drive over the bridge when heavy ships sail under it. reply gnfargbl 27 minutes agoparentprevWhy would slumping or buckling but not-quite-collapsing be a functionally better outcome than complete failure? In both cases, the sheer size of the physical changes is going to lead to forces that humans won't survive, so there's no benefit there. In both cases, the bridge is going to have to be completely demolished before rebuilding, so there's no benefit there. A bridge that could stand the loss of a single support pier without any significant collapse would obviously be preferable -- but that's a big ask. I'm not a structural engineer, but I am aware of scaling laws [1] and it feels to me that those scaling laws are going to mean that increasing the margin of safety by x is going to increase costs by x^n. For a project like this one, where cost was apparently the deciding factor over a tunnel, that matters.

Well for starters, there's a better chance of less (or ideally no) people forced to get their feet wet and go missing or die from drowning or hypothermia. reply gnfargbl 14 minutes agorootparentThe specific point I'm making (in the sentence following the one you quoted) is that no, there is not a better chance of those things. If a bridge of this size is going to fail in any significant way, it is going to lead to loss of life. The broader point is that attempts to blame the bridge designers here are misplaced. It really isn't reasonable to have hoped that they could design a structure that could cope with this kind of failure, within the cost constraints that they had. And cost constraints were a real thing for the designers of this particular bridge. reply irjustin 47 minutes agoparentprevThis situation is terrible, but to your specific question: Anyone can build a bridge, but it takes an engineer to barely make it stand. reply jack_riminton 39 minutes agorootparentI like this quote. We have a medieval bridge near to our house (1000 years old perhaps), it's incredibly solidly built, but could you call it well-engineered? It's a subtle distinction that I don't think many in the digital realm quite grasp either i.e. far too many over-engineered technical solutions for features and products that aren't even desired reply lukan 33 minutes agorootparent\"but could you call it well-engineered\" If it is still standing after 1000 years, I would say yes. You cannot build a bridge out of stones with bad engineering - it would collapse under its own weight. edit: does \"well engineered\" now means over engineered to some? reply loeg 15 minutes agoparentprevCheck out Brick Immortar (it’s a pun) on YouTube for some in depth videos on past container ship collisions with bridges and how newer bridges are engineered. reply _giorgio_ 59 minutes agoparentprevThe problem is the static scheme of the bridge. Most modern bridges are hyperstatic: if you remove one support, it still stands. Or at least isostatic: you remove one support or one span, and nothing happens to the nearest ones. This bridge was ill conceived: you remove one support or span, and it brings down everything like a chain that pulls down everything it's linked to. It's bad because the \"engineer\" just wanted to show off. reply 4gotunameagain 39 minutes agorootparentYou cannot put the entire weight of the 70's safety culture to an engineer \"showing off\" I bet there was a much more complex and nuanced analysis which included crossing ship dimensions, budget, time to completion, available technology, composition of the local seabed etc.. Designing a bridge is proper engineering and not that easy. reply baq 32 minutes agorootparent> Any idiot can build a bridge that stands, but it takes an engineer to build a bridge that barely stands. ...in other words. reply somat 30 minutes agoparentprevI would guess none. No bridge span could survive complete loss of it's supporting abutment. Some bridges are engineered to survive partial loss. For example if the left side goes the right side will hold it up. But from the video the ship looks like it took out the entire supporting structure. reply makach 1 hour agoparentprevModern bridges are required to endure a collision.

Was one of those limits perhaps exceeded? reply hgomersall 56 minutes agorootparentprevI'm not sure how many brand new bridges would stay up after having one of the piers on the main span removed. reply rob74 47 minutes agorootparentThe trick is to make sure the piers are not removed.

Here, amid yellowed books, historical maps and medieval manuscripts, Martin Scorsese has quietly made public a very private preoccupation. More than 50 storage boxes hold thousands of VHS tapes that contain films and television programs Scorsese recorded directly from broadcast television. The renowned director and film preservationist, it turns out, was also, for decades, a prolific guerrilla archivist. ‘Sin is fun!’ Martin Scorsese on brutality, love – and his rebirth on TikTok Read more Long before YouTube and Netflix gave the world instant access to a deep repository of media, Scorsese began the project of amassing his own private on-demand video library. In each week’s TV Guide, he would note the movies and shows that caught his interest. A full-time video archivist in Scorsese’s New York office would then record the telecasts from a kind of audiovisual hub made up of multiple VCRs and monitors, which could often be active at all hours. The tapes were meticulously labeled, cataloged initially using a library-like card system and later a computer, and filed away for Scorsese’s personal viewing and research. Spanning the 1980s through the 2000s, the Martin Scorsese VHS Tape Collection contains more than 4,400 distinct titles, including features, documentaries, shorts, history programs and award shows. Perusing the online catalogue, you’ll find everything from European arthouse masterpieces to an episode of Live with Regis and Kathie Lee featuring Scorsese’s beloved mother, Catherine, who made regular cameos in her son’s films. As the archive steadily grew, Scorsese made the videos an essential part of his film-making process. Typically during pre-production, he would ask his archivist to pull tapes of various films, many of which were not otherwise available on home video. He would then hand out the tapes to the cast and crew to serve as reference materials. View image in fullscreen Photograph: Megan Friedel “I do that on most of my pictures,” Scorsese said in a written interview. “For the actors, it’s usually about tone, mood, a certain emotional state, a suggestion of the world we’re working to create. With crew members, it’s often a cut, a camera movement at a specific point in the story, a certain way of framing. Not copying anything, but suggesting a way of approaching the question of how we’re going to tell the story.” The collection is also a physical manifestation of his famously omnivorous appetite for visual media. Scorsese has frequently spoken about growing up asthmatic in a New York City household that lacked books but was one of the first on the block to get a television set in 1948, when he was six years old. For young Marty, who wasn’t able to play in the streets as frequently or vigorously as other kids, the 16-inch screen of the black-and-white RCA Victor in the living room became his window to the world – and, critically, his first exposure to great cinema. On Friday nights, a New York station would show Italian neorealist films, and he would sometimes watch them in the company of family members who had immigrated from Sicily; he was struck, particularly, by the work of Roberto Rossellini, which he would later explore in his 1999 documentary My Voyage to Italy. In the mid-to late ’50s, Scorsese’s eyes were peeled to Million Dollar Movie, a program that showed the same film twice a day during weekdays and three times a day on weekends, allowing him, on multiple viewings, to begin thinking about how a movie like Citizen Kane was crafted – the movement of the camera, the use of music, the employment of effects such as slow motion. From grade school through his NYU days, Scorsese would do his homework as images from a muted TV flickered in front of him; much later, he brought the habit into the editing room while cutting his own films with his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. He has admitted to feeling a sense of loneliness outside the presence of a television. View image in fullscreen Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro on the set of Raging Bull in 1980. Photograph: Ronald Grant “He was always voraciously watching, absorbing, learning,” said Paul Mougey, who was an NYU film student when he became Scorsese’s video archivist for four years in the mid- to late ’80s. Shortly thereafter, in 1990, Scorsese formed the non-profit Film Foundation, which has since helped to restore more than 1,000 films. “Marty wanted to get every movie there ever was, and we recorded everything,” Mougey says. “He felt part of his mission as a preservationist was to create this amazing library – and share it with his friends.” Mougey fondly recalls the day at Scorsese’s office, then located in New York’s historic Brill Building, when “Bobby” De Niro turned up in boat shoes to pick up a VHS tape containing a film Scorsese wanted him to see before they began shooting Goodfellas. “I just remember thinking he was such a relaxed dude. Very quiet, very polite, very nice,” says Mougey, who landed a cameo as Terrorized Waiter in the 1990 gangster classic. One of Mougey’s successors, Kent Jones, would rise from video archivist to regular Scorsese collaborator, including co-writing A Life of Jesus, which is slated to be Scorsese’s follow-up to last year’s Killers of the Flower Moon. Several years ago, Scorsese began slowly donating the VHS collection. The wide availability of high-resolution DVD and Blu-Ray, as well as the rise of streaming, had diminished the usefulness of much of the hulking tape archive. Scorsese’s longtime film archivist, Mark McElhatten, and Scorsese’s final video archivist, Gina Telaroli, were friends of Erin Espelie, an associate professor of film at the University of Colorado Boulder. They collaborated to facilitate the university’s acquisition of the collection. In 2021, the final boxes of tapes arrived in Boulder from Scorsese’s Sikelia Productions office in Manhattan. The University of Colorado Boulder might seem a curious home for Scorsese’s collection. The 81-year-old is cinema’s foremost chronicler of New York life. He is a New York University alum and onetime teacher at NYU’s undergraduate film-making program. In 2021, NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts established the Martin Scorsese Institute of Global Cinematic Arts, which encompasses both a production center and cinema studies department that bear his name. Still, the Rare and Distinctive Collections in Boulder has positioned itself as a center for scholarship on the history of film and video. It houses significant collections from the influential experimental film-makers Stan Brakhage and Ken and Flo Jacobs. “Ultimately, I believe Scorsese honored the experimental film roots of the University of Colorado Boulder and respected our interest in intertwining archival work with teaching,” Espelie said via email. “Our hope in the Department of Cinema Studies and Moving Image Arts is that students, scholars, and community members will come to the Scorsese VHS archive for various purposes: to learn more about how Scorsese relied on the work of others to inform his film-making practice; how Scorsese was a voracious viewer; what movies and programs he watched (and then often shared with cast members); and, from a more documentary perspective, what was playing on television.” View image in fullscreen Photograph: Megan Friedel The broadcast recordings include commercials, bumpers and other marginalia, which Espelie said “are as fascinating, in some cases, as the originally desired main recording events. Because of the way television lacked backups, these VHS tapes may provide some of the only copies of these ‘interstitial’ materials.” For the archivists at the Rare and Distinctive Collections, the most pressing issue at the moment is the preservation of the Scorsese collection. Magnetic media degrades as it ages. It is believed that a VHS tape begins to progressively lose image quality after only 10 years. Some of Scorsese’s tapes are more than 40 years old. And so the entire archive must be digitized – a major undertaking. Converting thousands of hours of analog recordings is slow, tedious work. For the moment, the university requires the person requesting materials to pay for the digitization of any tape that hasn’t already been converted. Once the collection is readily accessible, the University of Colorado Boulder associate film professor Tiel Lundy expects researchers to begin conducting comparative analyses, pinpointing what Scorsese was watching at a given time and how that media may have informed the work he went on to create. “This could be a tremendous book project,” she said. Upon being informed of the existence of the Scorsese trove, John Klacsmann, an archivist at Anthology Film Archives in New York, immediately became intrigued by the notion that the director may have captured some true rarities on tape. “I’m certain there are some very rare and interesting copies of films, television broadcasts, and director’s cuts within this collection: deep cuts and obscurities that may have never been released on videotape, commercially or otherwise,” he said via email. “What kind of 1980s viewing list led to cinematic masterpieces like The King of Comedy and The Last Temptation of Christ? I’m certainly curious to know.” Explore more on these topics Martin Scorsese Television features Share Reuse this content",

The software works, but requires either buying a $300-$500 set of three circuit boards, or finding a specific PCIe capture card and potentially modifying it. If someone made a nicer version of the Domesday Duplicator - single board in a case, $100 to $200 - I think that would make the project a lot more accessible. Even better would be if someone started selling modified VHS players, having replaced their normal electronics with a capture device and a USB3 port. After all, many people don't have a soldering iron or a desktop computer. reply actionfromafar 8 hours agorootparentIf we are talking about serious archiving of lots of tapes, $500 for a capture device is nothing.

Is this a software capture card? I’m so confused. reply pkkm 11 hours agorootparentIt's a fully software-based VHS decoder. It takes the raw signal from a VHS tape, captured with a high speed sampling device, and reconstructs the video on your computer. In theory, this approach should allow higher quality digitization than any physical VHS player - it cuts the analog decoding electronics out of the loop, and it allows you to capture once, then tweak the algorithm and decode many times without disturbing the tape. You could even preserve the raw captures in case better decoding algorithms come out in the future. reply pdabbadabba 11 hours agorootparentprevIt appears to be software designed to use an SDR or (and?) a DTV capture card to capture the output of a VCR playing a VHS at the RF level, and then transcode and store it.

It bypasses all analog processing of the signal by the VHS player and captures the video signal directly from the tape head. All further processing is then done in software.

For many a rich folk, they will blow 7 figure sums on things they themselves feel are less important than such an ironclad guarantee without a moment's hesitation. It's not too far fetched. reply shannifin 10 hours agoparentprevProbably a lot easier and cheaper to build his own collection. Not sure paying others to do the work makes him the archivist though. reply listenallyall 10 hours agoparentprevI doubt Martin Scorsese was all that wealthy in the 80's when he started this. He was well-respected, sure, but he made art films, not summer blockbusters like Spielberg and Lucas or big-time comedies, and the external revenue streams (HBO, video rental) were fewer and smaller. He was known, but he wasn't MARTIN SCORSESE like we know him today (that would probably have been Coppola). And I'm guessing most of what he was taping was news and talk shows (to get accents, styles, vernacular, etc), which would often not be kept permanently by the broadcasters, and lots of more obscure things that would be difficult to track down. reply rurban 3 hours agorootparentNo news, no shows, sorry.

If the content was licensed elsewhere, at least they could have told viewers where to pay to view it. reply bell-cot 13 hours agoprevWorth noting, for crusaders against administrative overhead at colleges & universities: > In the basement of the University of Colorado Boulder’s main library, an 85-year-old stone fortress built in the Italian rural style, the archives of the school’s Rare and Distinctive Collections occupy rows of shelves as far as the eye can see. Here, amid yellowed books, historical maps and medieval manuscripts, Martin Scorsese has quietly made public a very private preoccupation. More than 50 storage boxes hold thousands of VHS tapes that contain films and television programs Scorsese recorded directly from broadcast television. The renowned director and film preservationist, it turns out, was also, for decades, a prolific guerrilla archivist. > For the archivists at the Rare and Distinct Collections, the most pressing issue at the moment is the preservation of the Scorsese collection. Magnetic media degrades as it ages. It is believed that a VHS tape begins to progressively lose image quality after only 10 years. Some of Scorsese’s tapes are more than 40 years old. And so the entire archive must be digitized – a major undertaking. Converting thousands of hours of analog recordings is slow, tedious work. In a perfect world, there might be plenty of well-run and -funded museums, which could do such work. In the world we've got...yeah. Big, prestige-hungry universities probably bear 90% or more of this burden. In a far-from-perfect world, it would still be lovely if universities provided detailed, honest financial statements - which clearly distinguished this kind of \"preserve history\" technical work...from the all the myriad sorts of education-irrelevant crap that they squander fortunes on these days. In the world we've got...I'm sure that top-of-market administrator salaries and hand-carved jade ceilings in the shiny new student amenities are higher priorities. reply nxobject 12 hours agoparentFor what it's worth, I'm sure that, if you asked every direct report why they created a position below them, they'd give a perfectly cromulent justification. That doesn't explain away the inefficiencies of college in general, but I do think there are root causes of that that are worth going in depth into. For example, presidents have large offices because they would say they hold many hats these days, more than they did in the past when higher ed institutions recieved more state money: fundraising on the road and glad-handing big donors for that personal touch, going to policymakers for more money and for advocacy, working with big donors to plan large investments that open entire research units, dealing with internal governance of the college and with faculty. No one person can handle all of these responsibilities. Or you could look at student services: some administrator saw a need to support certain student populations to increase retention (more college completion = more alumni $$$$, more good press about alums), so you now have people that create programming to engage first-generation college students, Black students, students with disabilities. That's a huge set of communities to engage (especially in large institutions), and no one person can do all of that as well. The question is: are colleges doing work that should rightly be done elsewhere, and why isn't society making that happen? For example, colleges are developing integrated safety nets and free services (people who disburse emergency funds, mental health care, people that help students navigate this internal system, for example), because American society and government doesn't offer such an integrated system, at least to the standards that colleges are now aspiring to. reply BirAdam 12 hours agorootparentTbh, regarding the preservation and digitization of the collection of concern in this thread, plenty of institutions, private individuals, companies, and organizations would love to take that work from the university. The uni, otoh, has no incentive to let the asset out of their hands. reply bell-cot 9 hours agorootparentTrue - but \"of the collection of concern in this thread\". And at this point in time. Vs. many older & larger universities have accumulated vast collections of stuff over the centuries - 99%+ of which would attract zero-ish interest from qualified alternative custodians. reply karaterobot 9 hours agoprev [–] > Scorsese’s secret life as an obsessive VHS archivist Seems like he employs an archivist, not that he's an archivist. A better title might be Scoreses's secret VHS archive, I don't know. Archivist is a specific job with specific, non-trivial training. It's a nitpick, but it reminds me of when people acted like Elon Musk designed the rockets for SpaceX or his Tesla cars, or when they talk about Steve Jobs creating the iPhone.

Tracecat automates the tasks a security analyst has to do when responding to a security alert: e.g. contact victims, investigate security logs, report vulnerability.The average security analyst deals with 100 alerts per day. As soon as an alert comes in, you have to investigate and respond. An average alert takes ~30 minutes to analyze (and 100 x 30 min = 50 hours > one whole day) Lots of things get dropped, and this creates vulnerabilities. Many breaches can be traced back to week old alerts that didn’t get properly investigated.Since the risks and costs are so high, top security teams currently pay Splunk SOAR $100,000&#x2F;year to help automate alert processing. It’s a click-and-drag workflow builder with webhooks, REST API integrations, and JSON processors. A security engineer would use it to build alert automations that look like this: (1) webhook to receive alert (e.g. unusual powershell cmd) from Microsoft Defender; (2) send yes&#x2F;no Slackbot to ask employee about the alert; (3) if confirmed as suspicious, send malware sample to VirusTotal for report (4) collect evidence from previous steps and dump it into a ticket.If $100k a year seems wildly expensive for a Zapier-like platform, you’d be half right.

And tines is def broader than fortune 10, they sell the heck out to startups, so I think you’ve got your market wrong. Expensive boogeyman Splunk is replaced by a lot of solid vendors now that aren’t $100k+. This flow isn’t really accurate either “ A security engineer would use it to build alert automations that look like this…” Also, you’re competing against the difficult rep of other open source sec tools, namely Elastisearch. It’s not used much for a reason. **But my very very top of mind, and what you’ll get asked by any sec team worth its salt, is what is your own security program, team of 2 data engineers? Literally, do you have anyone hired to do it? Who? Why should I ship you any of my data, let you tag it, and plug into my sec platforms, when I assume it’s basically nonexistent. Your environment becomes my env if I do, and we all know startup security posture bc we’ve worked on that side of the coin in the past. So don’t sell us nonsense around what audits you’ve passed. Open Source adds an interesting margin of safety here, but you’re a YC company with plans to make revenue, so the exposure is there somewhere. SaaS vendors are a massive supply chain vector right into a company, happens all the time and is growing, and the teams trying to sell me security tools with a 0.0% security program themselves are humorously many. reply dogman144 9 hours agoparentJust to drive the point home as I parsed through the details and looks like yall know the tech side well. Roadmap - you’re asking to plug into every mission critical sec tool. Nowhere on your roadmap is sec program details, who is doing it now, when will you get some from of pentest/audit (so so even then) or hire someone, or what yall know about security yourselves vs Facebook data eng. Tech descriptions - nowhere in it are you describing how youve done your appsec, or more accurately who has done it. Why should I give you api keys to crowdstrike and defender in that light. And you’re offering a cloud version already, depsite hitting on 0 of this. I think a big jump devs have trouble making when looking at security is this specific area. Sure, you’re saving me money and building slick tech. But Splunk isn’t going to get me hacked and roast my Saturday night. You (or more fairly vendors in the same profile as you) will. None of the data eng finesse and $50k in cost savings is worth that risk, or rather I price that risk at $50k haha. If the founders aren’t in the right headspace about their own security, I stay away - and you haven’t mentioned it once. Obviously im a little crusty from SaaS vendors burning firms over and over this way. But that’s the candid feedback. Deeper dive - The extent you discuss prodsec of your own sec tool is a token security.md file with nothing of value in it. If you are “practitioner obsessed” as mentioned in there too, then SaaS vendors owning the company and how/if/when id find out is a big part of what we obsess about. Look up the Jumpcloud hack for an example of this. reply neochris 9 hours agorootparentWe're going to work with these guys: https://www.oneleet.com/. They are awesome. reply dogman144 9 hours agorootparentI see that and I see a bad security posture, and the responsibility passed up chain and even harder to answer the same questions about oneleet. Will they secure your gsuite email I assume you’re using? Will they respond to phishing attacks at you? Will they prevent SMS 2FA? Will they get you into SSO? Is a password manager in place? Are y’all using personal laptops still? Segregated logins? Will they tell you not to share publicly as a VC-backed startup about who is doing your infrasec and by a pretty clear implication what your infra likely looks like? How to not turn you into me hacked is a balance of the prod/infrasec (like the company you linked), and bread and butter enterprise sec, which only comes from in house. So, in house team, or at least a 1x hire, such that there is at least a more than vague indicator that someone in house there day to day knows how to do security, or it doesn’t matter from a vendor risk point of views. The list of vendors that have passed audits with complaint environments and gotten hacked is very long. reply dogman144 9 hours agorootparentA way to handle this pragmatically is give board advisory shares to a person who straddles the following abilities (and listen to them), until you have enough funds to hire a sec eng: - is technical enough to know what needs to get done and why - has enough startup sec experience to know what pragmatic advice is in light of tight funding for startups If you’re YC-backed this should be easy to source. Why this thread matters and I’ll close it is dev-speak (“awesome, delightful, obsessed”) doesn’t matter at all for selling to a sec team, which is who is going to pay and vet this. That language just tells me it’s going to be a slog through VC sales-speak to answer the concerns I listed. It’s all about the above I mentioned, plus the tech setup which I think you have done with the right mindset (just plug into everything, parse it, ship it to the usual sources. Don’t try to reinvent Jira or Slack please). The other reason you have to think about this is what market SOARs sell into. They aren’t needed until a lot of other due diligence is done - EDR deployments, enterprise sec, email sec, etc etc. So, that’s a decently established company, and if they’re paying for SOAR, it means they are either the lucky program with healthy budget support, or have a threat environment just justifying it all. A lot of places just get a bad MSSP and call it a day. So, if you are a company justifying SOAR (bc of implied budget and program maturity), you deal with threat actors who know their stuff well enough. And, as a fair number of exploits indicate this part 2-3 years, they know to evaluate SaaS vendors as the way in. Looking at the stack, they could try Okta, CrowdStike, MSFT, GSuite and all the difficulty there… or the two data engineers and their startup. Gotta take it seriously, a lot of sec is abstract risk but this is happening in the wild now. reply neochris 8 hours agorootparentReally appreciate the advice here. I also hate security theatre. We will make it triple clear that our Cloud version is JUST for preview, not production. Repeat (as we mentioned in our README) for anybody reading this thread: Cloud is just for preview! Upload a known malware SHA-256 sample, send it off to VirusTotal, then pass the JSON response into a LLM action to summarize. There are plenty of workflows you can run to test our platform without exposing sensitive data. Excited to work on securing our platform though. Thanks for the basic checklist. We have a lot more work to do and will find the best security professionals to work with. There are plenty of scary good practitioners, folks who have seen and responded to APTs in their previous work, within the YC network. The first thing we did when we got into YC was network with the YC security community. Here are some shout outs who are helping YC companies and beyond truly improve their security posture: - Oneleet: 10 year+ experienced red teamers, now building an all-in-one pentest, vCISO, vSOC, and compliance platform and service - 0Pass: FIDO2 keys as service (ex-SpaceX, Amazon Cognito security engineers) - Infisical: open source secrets management reply neochris 9 hours agoparentprevAppreciate the Tines comparison. reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agoprevPlease put a stake in the heart of Palo Alto's XSOAR SOAR. Wishing you much success. Edit: Keep in mind, the folks who operate this are typically not engineers. They are security analysts and other non dev infosec/cybersec stakeholders. Refer to how Palo Alot XSOAR uses drag and drop playbooks [1] (somewhat like n8n's workflow builder [2], a Zapier competitor). I recommend building a library of default playbooks that customer SOCs and other detection response consumers of your product can adopt (based on customer product feedback and conversations), like you adapt your business to SAP vs customizing SAP to your business.

That's what we are here for. Any thoughts on our analysis regarding case management and log storage? These are two technical decisions we made before writing a single line of code to bring down cost and increase value-for-money. reply toomuchtodo 14 hours agorootparentStaying within the tool to manage cases is good vs shelling out to Jira or another ticketing tool. Folks with purchasing authority typically want their analysts in the tool as much as possible (in my experience; you may find customers who want to open incidents elsewhere so keep that interface in mind). Also a good choice in storing logs. Make a margin but don't be greedy, otherwise you turn into Splunk, where folks don't want to use the product effectively because they can't afford to. Make it easy to route logs to S3 cold storage or other \"reliable enough\" object storage systems based on criteria, but retaining the capability to retrieve them if needed for forensics or compliance/audit sampling. Log storage intervals are traditionally some variation of 30, 60, 90 days, a year, seven years, etc. Architect accordingly based on your customers' record retention schedule(s), control/compliance requirements, etc. reply neochris 14 hours agorootparentGlad to hear we are on the right track. Tracecat is still in alpha, but would be great to have your thoughts / opinions / feedback in our Discord community. We are anon-friendly. There's still a lot more we can innovation on. reply kjs3 13 hours agorootparentprevyou may find customers who want to open incidents elsewhere so keep that interface in mind My large financial (and many in our peer group that I've talked to) see \"open incidents elsewhere\" (WorkDay in our case) as minimum table stakes. YMMV. reply toomuchtodo 13 hours agorootparentThis is helpful ground truth, thanks for sharing. I only see what I see, but asking everyone else what they see is free(ish). reply badrabbit 12 hours agoparentprevHear,hear! I can't express this sentiment enough. Default playbooks are great but integrations with every possible tool,appliance and platform is a must. reply rosslazer 6 hours agoprevI don't know why so many people here are shitting on you guys. It is an impressive demo and launch and a wide-open market. I'm rooting for you, guys. There's an easy opening even just after the \"inbox\" for the security alert use case. reply badrabbit 12 hours agoprevKudos on the effort for sure. Your biggest challenge is having good integrations for literally everything. Second big challenge: companies that will use open source are a rarity. I can't express how much stuff is my bread and butter. No one wants to write scripts, that's the whole point of a soar in the minds of people using this. Really, the support is most of the cost not the product itself. Just have splunk create an app or whatever integration. Then your playbooks have to be easy to manage which I am sure you can figure out. But then you have to implement case management too, no one wants a separate case management tool. These days, even the SIEM is expected to be just another tab/feature in the soar. I hope you don't expect security teams to self-host either. It's a major PITA. I like opensource, but not having support first and foremost is a huge redflag for me since I have been burned badly by foss projects. If you have a fully managed and supported commercial version of the product, that's be great. Edit: oh and the \"ai\" stuff only impresses management types, great if that's your audience but at least in my experience, you better be ready to answer questions around that and expect mild hostility because of how gimmicky it is (just my $0.2) reply daryllimyt 12 hours agoparentThanks for sharing. Agreed on having automation + Jira-like tracking in one place. We've implemented case management[1] and have a Cloud version[2]. We're still early but we ship fast. We will have a full post on the AI part next week. A few unique ideas to look forward to -- open source LLMs for specialized tasks and multimodal evidence for cases (i.e. multimodal search across images, deepfakes etc.) [1]: https://docs.tracecat.com/core/case-management [2]: https://platform.tracecat.com/ reply badrabbit 8 hours agorootparentCool. Forget Jira though, think more \"thehive\" which is opensource (implemented it once myself). There may also be cortex responders you can copy+adapt.if you won't have good commercial support soon, your audience is people using thehive. IR case management has needs like evidence collection and reporting (mitre integration usually). Best of luck. Glad someone is doing this. reply tomashertus 12 hours agoprevThese are exciting times in the cybersecurity industry with the recent growth of open-source security tools (osquery, Fleet, Wazuh, etc.). Anyway, I'm skeptical about the detection efficacies, usefulness, and scalability of those products. I do not see them widely adopted either. These are my observations from your pitch: Your pitch mentions large costs for traditional SOAR products and that you want your solution to be focused on smaller companies that don't have money to pay for expensive SOC tools. Nevertheless, the market reality is that if a company has a SOC team (who is the traditional end-user of SOAR tool), they don't care about $100k for a SOAR because they will spend hundreds of thousands a month for log storage, security tools, and HR. It's much more common for your target audience to use ITSM as a security incidents management tool. Just look at what ServiceNow is doing in this space for example: https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-security-man.... Based on this one fact, I think that you didn't spend enough time understanding your target customer who are in this case not SOC/Security teams, but IT teams. Incident management is a critical process for every SOC team and its effectiveness is tracked by measuring the mean-time-to-resolve metric. How do you want to convince SOC teams to use open-source tools for their mission-critical process rather than buying one of the established SOAR tools that are integrated with their security stack? (& there are many options in the SOAR space) How can your product help companies lower the operational costs of case management? (improving the mean-time-to-resolve KPI) Please, don't get discouraged by my comments. SOAR is an essential part of every security stack and the current offerings have flaws. But the narrative in your pitch is flawed and indicates a lack of understanding of current security buyers and personas. reply neochris 11 hours agoparentStartups win by questioning every assumption from first principles. We look forward to the fight. reply francoismassot 13 hours agoprevThis is awesome; we need this kind of alternative to overpriced software like Splunk. We built and open-sourced Quickwit to see this kind of tool built on top of it. We will follow Tracecat closely. I'm convinced this will impact our roadmap, and I'm happy to receive any feedback so you can get the most out of Quickwit for Tracecat.

Unlike a pure infrastructure tool (MongoDB, Elastic, Terraform), UI/UX is a critical factor for adopting a SOAR.

    "originBody": "For Brilliant Color: Packaging the First LSD Blotter Eric Ghost's cleverly disguised LSD packaging mirrored the 1960s counterculture's psychedelic vision. By: Erik Davis The image that follows is not of actual Kodak film but rather of a clever and gently satiric stealth packaging for underground LSD made by the New Yorker Eric Ghost — aka Eric Brown — in 1968. Ghost first took LSD in the Lower East Side around 1965, after a peripatetic life of military service, armed robbery, and prison. He swallowed nearly 4,000 micrograms, or mics, of pure Sandoz, smeared across a sugar cube, and the thermonuclear revelation occasioned by this enormous dose convinced him to co-found the Psychedelicatessen, a legendary though short-lived head shop that opened on 164 Avenue A in 1966. Like many acid people at the time, Ghost was messianic about the molecule and its potential to improve people and the world. Once LSD was banned, he decided to start cooking and distributing the material himself. In contrast to today, when psychedelics are imagined to be medicines, party favors, or indigenous sacraments, many LSD users in the 1960s imagined their favorite substance as a kind of media. Like the increasingly technological media of the postwar world, LSD filters, transforms, and amplifies non-drug phenomena. Ghost played with this association by disguising his acid as film stock promising “brilliant color.” Each sheet was wrapped inside mylar, which not only protected the acid from damaging UV light, but also discouraged suspicious parties from opening the package on a whim, potentially destroying unexposed film. This “medium is the message” idea permeated acid discourse and marketing. Other examples include “Window pane,” “Clearlist,” and some of the first printed LSD blotters, which featured electric light bulbs. Ghost’s stealth packaging contained a novel and significant development in LSD distribution: the first mechanically produced examples of blotter paper dosed with drops of LSD. Liquid LSD had been placed on actual blotting paper and other paper products before, but these transfers would occur one drop at a time, using a pipette or eye-dropper. Ghost and a colleague accelerated this process by designing and building the Mark I, a device that allowed 100 pins to be dipped simultaneously into a pan of LSD in solution, and then moved as a single unit and impressed simultaneously onto a single absorbent piece of paper. The pins, and the dosed paper that resulted, followed a compact grid, which took the form of five tight rows of 20 columns each — the “5-20” pattern slyly referred to above. Each one of the Ghost’s drops contained a hefty 1,000 mics of LSD, which were left to the distributor or client to manually cut into four smaller hits, each packing a still solid 250 mic punch. This arrangement — the “four-way” — would recur throughout the history of blotter. Opening Ghost’s package, purchasers would discover a handy information sheet that today gives us a sense of how some underground purveyors understood and promoted their wares. Rather than hippie mysticism or revolutionary cant, Ghost’s text presents LSD as a scientific product of a modern research lab run by a pharmaceutical corporation. Though LSD was related to an organic material — the ergot fungus on rye — part of the drug’s curious profile emerged from its origins at the heart of European technological modernity. Though some of Ghost’s information is off (LSD is not chemically similar to mescaline), it demonstrates the nerdy fascination that was always part of modern psychedelic culture. The most dominant and consistent idea in postwar psychedelic culture and research, still widely used today, is the role of “set and setting” in influencing the experience. Though trumpeted by Timothy Leary and his co-authors in the 1964 book “The Psychedelic Experience,” the notion that LSD reflects and amplifies internal attitudes and environment cues had been recognized by researchers and users in the 1950s. This recursive effect helps explain the wide variety and plasticity of psychedelic effects, as well as the importance of the cultural stories that surround these compounds — expanded consciousness in the 1960s; cluster headaches and PTSD today. Even in those hedonistic and experimental eras, though, the important role of the guide was recognized. Today’s clinical and therapeutic promoters of the “psychedelic renaissance” often present themselves as novel pioneers. Ghost’s text reminds us that the 1960s research community had already explored many clinical applications of LSD — for alcoholism, pain and anxiety among cancer patients, psychological repression, and even the challenges of autism. At the same time, the mention of LSD as a possible “cure” for homosexuality — something that was explored earlier in the 1960s by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, who later embraced his gay identity — reminds us of the distortion inherent in such research agendas, as well as LSD’s darker legacy as an agent of behavioral modification.

You're still relying on diffusion of solutes to achieve some degree of uniformity across several fixed volumes. reply nicd 3 hours agorootparentDiffusion in liquid is relatively consistent. When paper is soaked and allowed to dry, it can produce uneven concentrations as regions evaporate at different rates, and solutes move along with the flow of solvent. A good example of this is water color painting: if you mix paint into water and then apply it to the paper, the resulting patterns may be less uniform than when applied. reply everythingbagel 18 hours agoprevWow, is this what the Paul Simon song called Kodachrome is actually about?

No family history before then. Now he has to be continually drugged up and is a shell of his former self. Unless you are trying to treat some other illness it isn’t worth the risk until we better understand the mechanisms behind why psychedelics can trigger mental disorders. reply cosmojg 16 hours agorootparent> Unless you are trying to treat some other illness it isn’t worth the risk until we better understand the mechanisms behind why psychedelics can trigger mental disorders. Speak for yourself. Risk tolerance is highly subjective. It's true that a small percentage of individuals who try psychedelics will develop otherwise unexplained mental illness. It's also true that a small percentage of individuals who try skydiving will break their legs and that a small percentage of individuals who try scuba diving will drown. However, ultimately, it's up to individuals to decide for themselves whether it's worth bearing such risks for the sake of experiencing something new and exciting. Personally, I'd recommend that healthy people try all three of those activities. Life's short, after all, and you're more likely to get hurt in a car accident on your way there than you are to suffer injury from any of those particular activities in and of themselves. In every endeavor, it's up to you to do your own research and make as rational and informed a decision as you can given the available evidence. reply fwipsy 12 hours agorootparentDo you have statistics to back up the relative safety of those activities? Lots of people get in trouble with car accidents because lots of people drive cars. But I would think that if you both drive and skydive, the latter is far more likely to hurt you. reply advael 9 hours agorootparentAs with many complicated analyses, we can introduce hypothetical artifacts or simplifications to serve almost any hypothesis! For example, most skydiving is done in a guided and controlled way, with participants paying a professional instructor to help them through the process on a flight where everyone involved knows that people will be jumping out of this plane, in areas chosen by said flights for this to be done in. The risk of injury or death would be much higher if you were to, say, bowl over a flight attendant on a commercial plane flying over, say, the Rocky Mountains, steal a backpack from a supply area that you assume is a parachute, shove open the emergency exit, and jump out. However, that risk might be significantly lower if you happened to have prior training as a military paratrooper Lifetime risk of death in a car accident might come down to frequency. But it could also be affected by such factors as road conditions, weather, your own physical and mental health, the condition of your car, and whether you're being pursued by a military helicopter Broad statistics tend to be a poor substitute for understanding one's own situation in assessing the risks one is willing to take. They are used in science because science tends to aim to draw broad conclusions over large aggregates. Your own individual risk assessment may take such aggregate measures into account, but it's unlikely that this is adequate to make such assessments wisely, and either way only informs your assessment of risk rather than your tolerance for it reply LoganDark 14 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn't necessarily recommend psychedelics to everyone, regardless of health. I'd love for it to be made a legal option though, for those that do want to try it of their own volition. reply hackable_sand 13 hours agorootparentLegalization also opens crucial gateways to clinical research and market regulation. These effects can be better communicated and consumers have legal advocacy if they are harmed. reply LoganDark 13 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. One of the big dangers of obtaining LSD right now isn't just the effects of LSD itself, it's the risk of getting something else like NBOMe that could flat-out kill you. A regulated market would allow the purchase of real, clean LSD, without the risk of more dangerous substitutes. People have taken less than a few doses of NBOMe and died. Meanwhile there are no known deaths by LSD overdose, people have taken thousands of doses of LSD and lived. reply hackable_sand 13 hours agorootparentThere is speculation that an elephant suffered a seizure and died in 1962 after it was given a \"god\" dose which is kinda fun. The wiki page also suggests they tried to help it and accidentally killed it that way. Definitely something to consider if your friend Jake goes catatonic while staring at Yugioh cards and the EMTs misdiagnose. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusko reply LoganDark 12 hours agorootparentI think giving LSD to an elephant (especially 300mg, holy crap) is a very very bad idea, animals can't really be informed of its effects. You can tell a person what to expect and not to panic, but you can't do that with an animal. I wonder if that would be animal abuse also. reply ernst_klim 15 hours agorootparentprevThere is no proven causality between psychedelics and mental illnesses. We have so far only hypothesis. But sure, you're doing something not well researched when you take psychedelics, and various people have very different experiences with them from getting a revelation to having the worst experiences of their lives. So yeah, there are unknown risks and unknown benefits, thread carefully and take that into account. reply LoganDark 16 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK psychedelics cause the brain to become more interconnected for the duration of their effect, which can activate parts that aren't normally active. What we don't know is exactly what parts can just be activated in this way to trigger schizophrenia (or other disorders), and how to detect how much at risk someone may be. reply cosmojg 16 hours agorootparentWhile there is evidence to support some of what you're saying, the physical mechanism backing the causal relationship between psychedelic use and psychological disorders is far more complicated and nowhere near as well understood as you seem to believe. Heck, the physical mechanism behind nearly all psychological disorders in isolation remains poorly understood, let alone their interaction with any particular psychedelic. reply LoganDark 16 hours agorootparent> the physical mechanism behind nearly all psychological disorders in isolation remains poorly understood, let alone their interaction with any particular psychedelic. That's what I'm saying, though. There's no way to know how susceptible one is to a particular disorder in general, let alone while on psychedelics. There is evidence of psychedelic use connecting parts of the brain that aren't normally connected, AFAIK the white matter becomes much more interconnected during a psychedelic trip. reply zzzzzzzzzz10 14 hours agorootparentprev100% worth any risk. reply LoganDark 12 hours agorootparentI think most people with type-2 HPPD would disagree.

Obviously when you start taking high doses and reality kind of breaks down the distinction becomes moot, but at regular doses it does matter. reply stared 17 hours agorootparentI like saying that it is an S4 - set, setting, substance, and soul. And the substance (as long as it is a tryptamine) is less important, save for personal preferences. (I have heard a lot about LSD for fun and shrooms for insights - for me, there is no such distinction; if anything, LSD, even in lower doses, produces more profound associations, ones that words cannot capture. At higher doses, well, as you said, the distinction becomes mood.) At the same time, the soul (overall personality, mind, motivations, desires, approach, will, and goals) is crucial. reply diggan 18 hours agorootparentprev> I feel like LSD is way more visual (basically a fun rollercoaster ride) and the actual introspection happens on stuff like shrooms.

Also, reading this linked person's comment, they were on DMT and it sounds like they have some strong ideas about how the universe works (they mention having been to \"heaven\" before and keep mentioning hell and evil and devils as if they are real). Yes, people should be careful, especially when they have issues with mental health. reply LoganDark 16 hours agorootparentDMT is related to LSD (they're both tryptamines). I think DMT made them hallucinate those things which is why they talk \"as if they are real\" - that's something they felt like they genuinely experienced, which is what made it so traumatic. As for the heaven thing, I do not know if they were particularly susceptible to delusions before ever taking anything, but if they were, then it was probably not the right choice, yeah.

That was the mandala that time. This was mixed with dreamscape fantasies of conquest and rape on grandiose scale, a Roman emperor, slicing down hordes, restructuring time in a slash of blood, a ball of divine destruction held in potential, ready to be unleashed at any time. It was sexually arousing. Some might rationalize this, as getting a better grip on one's Jungian shadow. I sometimes view the experience that way, but sometimes I wonder if it slightly loosened some important retaining bolt. I'm pretty sure negative vibes can come out of the Pandora's psychedelic box, too. Also, this variability in effect hinders using it therapeutically.

Also, you don't normally hallucinate in the same way media portrays it (there are drugs that make you hallucinate though) AFAIK (none of my friends or I hallucinated on psilocybin/LSD; I wouldn't call DMT hallucinations either).

I'm aware the typical dose is 100μg. I've taken up to 600μg before (yes all at once), and it'll keep me wide awake for 24 hours straight but the actual trip itself won't be that much more intense. I'm autistic and have ADHD so it might affect me differently than the typical person. I don't necessarily like it that way (I would love one of the super-intense experiences that people tend to get really excited over) but so far I haven't been able to cause a particularly strong effect. Very curious why I'm either more resistant to it or more tolerant of it to the point of being underwhelmed.

It doesn't make you smarter or more creative, any more than going on a backpacking trip or reading a good book -- it just gives you a new way of seeing the world and your place in it temporarily. What you do with that experience is going to be highly personal. I know that people can become out-right messianic after an LSD trip, but people can be similarly evangelical about travel or books or, obviously, religious experiences. later edit: I actually do think it's more to it than that, for two reasons -- one is that while you're on acid, your brain tends to make wild connections between things that you wouldn't ordinarily do, but I don't think that's good or bad, necessarily -- it's like running an LLM on a very high temperature, it can be funny and interesting, but it's very hit and miss. The second is that I think it triggers a lot of self-reflection (to say the least) and can help you recognize and break out of negative personal patterns -- but that also tends to be what people think of as \"bad trips\". reply int_19h 16 hours agorootparentI would add that it's not necessarily just self-reflection, but also reflection on other people around you, and on the world in general. This kind of stuff can also go places that, while more accurate than one's original perception, are not necessarily what one might like. And unlike negative personal patterns, this might not be something you can do anything about (the world stuff in particular). I still consider that valuable experience in its own right, but then I was never a proponent of \"the less you know, the more soundly you sleep\". Others may have a different subjective preference on that. As far as \"messianic\" stuff, I think it comes mostly from heightened empathy, which appears to be a fairly universal thing during a trip (even if it doesn't necessarily stick after). reply aredox 15 hours agorootparentThanks. That sounds far more balanced than what one can find in psychedelic literature _à la_ Leary. reply LoganDark 16 hours agorootparentprev> it's like running an LLM on a very high temperature I can second this, specifically. For me, LSD often triggers thoughts that can't be put into words - upon trying, out come sentences like this: \"can have a haves and take a three sixteenth quarters. can have a what's very much like. can have an um somethings or others .... mmm much of somethings or others.... can havings a taken umpteenth very good time ....\" Those are real sentences I typed up while on LSD, knowing that they were complete gibberish, but it's what came out of my brain when I tried to put the thoughts into words. The thoughts had some sort of meaning, but not in words, just indescribable concepts. Whatever part of my brain translates thoughts and concepts into words had never been trained on those types of thoughts before, so it came out as gibberish. reply sjm 17 hours agoparentprevLSD was recently granted \"breakthrough-therapy status\" by the FDA after clinical trials show a single dose provides \"immediate and lasting relief\" from generalized anxiety [0].

I myself have experienced personal revelations through psychedelics that have had lasting effects and positive consequences in my life. My gut feeling is that any revelations or breakthroughs people have from psychedelics could also eventually occur through other means (therapy, meditation, etc.), but not as quick.

Philosophers still argue about what consciousness even is at the most fundamental level, so quantifying that is not happening. Creativity is just as much about the volatile and fickle relationships among context, inspiration, stimuli, motivation, experience, emotional state at a very granular (likely imperceptible) level, etc. as it is about somewhat measurable things like abstract reasoning. You'd have to be able to look in two different dimensions– one where someone generated creative output having used a psychedelic and one generating the same creative output not having used it to see anything close to an accurate split, and even then, creativity is so subjective that it wouldn't prove much. Like many psychoactive substances, there are probably complex context-dependent trade-offs for the cognition, and when it comes to creative utility, they probably don't affect the process like someone would expect. Perception is relative; some senses may appear heightened (e.g. sense of taste with marijuana use,) when in reality, other competing stimuli are slightly muted. While that would be very consequential in quantitative cognitive measurements, the distinction is probably irrelevant in creative processes. If we didn't have an accurate way to measure sleep, someone would probably declare white noise machines bunk because noise interrupts sleep and they actually make your environment noisier.

The preponderance of dedicated professional artists and designers I know (on the artier end of the spectrum) have at least dabbled in hallucinogens. Personally, I have not. If you include marijuana, even though that's far more like Adderall in its usage patterns, that number is nearly 100%. Almost none of that drug usage, from what I've seen, is used in direct response to needing inspiration. Of course, none of this is universal, but to say it's not common or influential because you are not aware of many people that are working while tripping is utterly ridiculous. > (Usually the crutch becomes an addiction, or the toxicity/impurities in the product take their toll, and you end up with a coda like at the end of PK Dick's _A Scanner Darkly_) Ah-- that you're basing at least some of your conclusions on fiction certainly fills in some holes. > What I find most specific to LSD though is that it seems to have produced a long list of LSD advocates, whose work consists only of waxing poetics about how \"LSD gives you mental superpowers\", and... Not much else. No actual \"general\" poetry, no Great Text, no theoretical breakthrough in philosophy nor science...) You can find bullshit artists peddling damned near anything for their own benefit, and hallucinogens are one of the worst offenders. That's not an argument against the efficacy of anything. And to be clear, I'm not advocating for anything. Neither for hallucinogen usage, nor abstinence. reply pvg 19 hours agoparentprevobjective -strong emphasis- Where would this come from, other than self-reporting?

In general, mind-altering-substance-to-aid/inspire-creativity doesn't feel like some controversial statement that requires citations - we've got everything from shamanism, through the cliche of the drunk writer to Kubla Khan: or A Vision in a Dream, etc, etc. Why would it be different for LSD or be dependent on LSD providing \"access to a deeper, higher reality\"? reply piva00 16 hours agorootparentprevNot every human experience is supposed to be based on performance, the moment you get away with performance as the utmost objective you will find some freedom. LSD and other psychedelics give you insights, ways to see things without the noise of your ego always in front of it, and those experiences are valuable to oneself, not necessarily to be more productive, more creative, etc. Many artists used LSD, many other artists are teetotalers, each one has their own experiences to draw from to create their art, it's the sum of the self experience that creates impactful work. You are looking at this as if life is some sort of competitive sport and people are only trying to gain an edge by taking mind-altering substances, that's not how life works nor a good way to approach those substances.

If there was any medical value to any of this nonsense it’d already be well known in Europe, China, Russia, or India. reply epiccoleman 18 hours agorootparentThis argument ignores the fact that medical research into the potential benefits of \"this nonsense\" has been under way in the US for over 20 years. Johns Hopkins has a dedicated research group in this area [1], and has published peer-reviewed research for various applications of these drugs. It's easy to become cynical about psychedelics, because there's a ton of bullshit in the space. (And it's probably fair to assess that the push of these substances into the black market helped create an environment where only \"hippie-esque\" bullshit could thrive). But the results seem pretty clear that there's real potential in these drugs to alleviate human suffering in many ways. Does that mean that these drugs unlock magical insights or enhance the intelligence of their users? Of course not, and no one serious is suggesting that they do. But there's been plenty of real research over the past two decades that makes dismissing the medical value of psychedelics as \"nonsense\" a fairly silly take.

But no, I mostly see use by creatives \"stuck in a rut\", with a wide gap between what they perceive (\"LSD helps me getting more creative\", \"I had a breakthrough\", or the more extreme \"it opened my mind to new realities\") and objective reality (mediocre work). You don't see \"the best works of this artist come from his LSD period\". You see another type/style of work (... usually \"psychedelic\"). You dont see groundbreaking stuff in the general, universal term, despite all the stuff about \"a higher plane of existence\", \"opening the mind\", \"being one with the universe\". reply jes5199 15 hours agorootparentI think the closest thing I know about is Harman and Fadiman's 1966 study where they gave mescaline to a diverse group of professionals to see if it could help them find creative solutions to problems they were stuck on at work. Apparently it worked!

I mean, going from \"I can't do anything\" to \"I can do mediocre work\" is a fairly big improvement. That said, in general, I would agree that the long-term effects of LSD on one's abilities are not all that profound. What it does, mostly, is making you more aware of things (or rather connections between things), centered on yourself. Whether this actually leads to any improvement depends on what one does with this information, but, well... how many people drastically change their lifestyle after being told by a doctor that they should do so? Same applies here. As far as doing things during a trip, this can go either way. LSD takes one's \"pattern matcher\" up to 11, basically. This means that you can easily spot actual patterns that are there that would take you a lot of time in a normal state of mind, but it also means that you start seeing clear patterns in random noise. Since either manifest as intuition, the only reliable way to distinguish them is by rigorous methodical testing, which can be done, but during the trip it's basically swimming against the current, so generally, people don't. The quality of the output then depends on the input (i.e. on whether there was an actual pattern to find or not, and on how much random noise there was in the environment). It's no wonder, then, that this averages out to mediocre. But I do think that actual quantifiable improvements could be achieved with strict adherence to a \"trip protocol\" scientifically developed to optimize for that. Those wouldn't be fun trips, though! And, of course, you'd need to develop such a protocol first through study, which is difficult when it's such a tightly controlled substance. reply aredox 14 hours agorootparentSorry, my writing isn't as good or clear as I wish: my beef is with the mystique around LSD opening \"the gates of reality\" - extraordinary,above normal claims. That's why getting from a rut to mediocre when you were once great is not what I had in mind. Let's be honest: if people have been talking so much about LSD for so long, it is not as an aid to get back to mediocre. reply int_19h 13 hours agorootparentI think you're overly focusing on one particular subset of people talking about LSD. I can assure you that \"getting back to normal\" is a very common motivation for many, and they do talk about it. It's just not the kind of talk that you see making sensational headlines. The \"gates of reality\" stuff is more complicated. Quite a few people interpret it in a very... religious sense. Like your mind literally \"connects\" to some other place or entities that actually physically exists and can grant one powers. I can totally see how people who are religious, or already into various esoteric spiritual practices, or even just raised in a culture where such themes are common, can have that takeaway from a trip - what they see is their own consciousness reflected, but if they are already primed to believe in such stuff literally, it can be very convincing. But, conversely, there are many people that are perfectly capable of understanding that the ultimate source of all experiences on a trip is one's own mind; \"opening the gates\" then can metaphorically mean better awareness of oneself and one's interactions with the world at large, but I can't think of any way you'd be able to quantify that externally. reply LoganDark 17 hours agoparentprevFor me LSD is a recreational experience. I don't think it's improved my cognition, creativity or consciousness, and don't know if it's given me any revelations either. What I do know is that taking some every couple weeks makes me happy, and it's fun to talk to friends on it, because the way it makes me think feels satisfying. It just feels nice. I think the admiration for it is because it's only recently starting to be re-explored by scientists and researchers, and psychedelics are generally very interesting substances (at least in my opinion). On top of that, the culture and history behind them is also quite interesting. The fact that they're currently illegal in the US is quite unfortunate. reply heap_perms 16 hours agorootparentMicrodosing LSD does wonders to my thoughts. I'm not sure if one can call it \"improved cognition\" (what does that even mean) reply aredox 16 hours agorootparentGreat for you, but it is with the self-reporting that I have a problem. Is it true or has the drug just altered your evaluation of yourself? If you read Oliver Sacks' _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales_, you'd see that self-perception can be completely off the mark. reply heap_perms 9 hours agorootparentYes, a substance like LSD can alter one's self-evaluation, but that doesn't negate the validity of the experience. LSD and similar substances offer a unique lens, a radical shift in perspective that can unveil new ideas, hidden patterns. If you get a the message, hang up the phone. In the end, all ideas have to be measured against all other ideas. But I suppose what you're aiming at here are objective, measurable results in a scientific context? Well, we have a huge hole in the research body of about 45 years, thanks to criminalization (it is very tedious to get a study approved on a schedule 1 drug). However, in recent years, it seems to be opening up. They call it the psychedelic renaissance. Numerous studies have explored both the subjective effects and the applications in mental health. One that strikes out to me involves testing on individuals attempting to quit smoking. After a year, 80% (!) of the participants successfully maintained their cessation from smoking. [1] This is after a single dose! Long rant, the point is, there are measurable, real-world impacts that these substances can have.

I don't know why, though. What microdosing schedule do you use? reply drooby 18 hours agoparentprevCurious, have you ever tried a psychedelic? reply aredox 15 hours agorootparentNope. I was an avid reader of PK Dick - and the coda to _A Scanner Darkly_ was a clear warning that drugs weren't like doping, a trade where your lose your health but gain performance above normal, but a lose-lose proposition - a _miroir aux alouettes_. Another artist I am extremely fond of, Mœbius (Jean Giraud), also had a very bad time after a failed psychedelic initiation (but my memory may be wrong, as I can't find it in writing on the web - was it in a biographical documentary or am I mixing him with someone else?). Like Jodorowsky, I never felt I needed drugs - even to enjoy his work, PKD's work or other usually associated with psychedelic use or culture (Aldiss, Lem, Herbert,Zelazny, Bester). When I listen to weird electrical like Aphex Twin or Bicep and people in the comments talk how they seem to need drugs to feel the music kick, I seriously wonder why - I felt there was little to gain for a great risk to take (either from impurities in the substance, or the substance itself - the risk of a bad trip). In short: I'm abnormal enough? I am clearly more creative than baseline (but less disciplined to really exploit it - and there isn't a drug with the right profile to make one more disciplined yet critical enough to stay on course). As a sci-fi reader, of course I am very interested in other dimensions, breakthroughs, alien thinking and superpowers. And LSD and others have that mystique - but seem very disappointing in reality, compared to those expectations. reply Klonoar 15 hours agorootparentFor what it’s worth, your entire comment feels like something I would write - except I have taken these substances at decent levels.

Here's a brief review of what we've been working on. SPQR 2.0 news #431 In this release, we add new syntax to handle sharding configuration. To make all things work, you should create a distribution via CREATE DISTRIBUTION command. The next step is to specify a list of tables and columns via ATTACH RELATION command. At the end specify a list of ranges: which values to route to which shard via CREATE KEY RANGE command. You can see an example at Syntax.md. SHARDING RULE syntax is deprecated now. Extended Protocol improvements We continue to work on the extended protocol support in SPQR. A lot of work has already been done, and in most cases, the router works correctly. Shards [re]balancing news The essential part of our solution is smart shard rebalancing. We made the first version of this component (again). Data migration between shards aims to balance the workload across shards proportionally. The main idea is to minimize any locking impact during these migrations, which is accomplished by reducing the size of the data ranges being transferred. We still have a lot of room for improvement. The full list of changes can be found in the release notes. Stay tuned! 5 10 9 7 Replies: 0 comments Sign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub. Already have an account?

I dont know how well the engine could make use of the extra resources. If it scales well vertically, I expect it to cover 80% - 95% of use cases for people using Postgres. Probably with less complexity, and less overhead than scaling horziontally reply endymi0n 20 hours agoparentFar. As in, really, really far. We started out with Postgres because it was just the simple and sensible option for a production prototype, and when somebody came around telling me we need something more scalable recently, I calculated that there's not even enough addressable market in the world for our business for more than 4x our size. That's exactly the two remaining vertical doublings of our DB instance (to ridiculously looking RAM & CPU numbers) we could still do in case we need it. Other than that, thanks to a lot of the recent work on connection handling and concurrency since PG 11, Postgres is getting better and better actually using these additional resources well: https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/performance-comparison-maj... reply ThinkBeat 19 hours agorootparentSeveral years ago I was a contractor on a project for that would sip up data from all forms of sensor and moving objects around a large city. It was decided that we needed Kafka and a few similar tools to handle it. It was not hard to calculate the current max traffic or estimate the traffic growth over the next 10 years. I did a demo of the system running on my laptop (all of it) + Postgres handling 100x the current data without too much difficulty. Still they went with the \"scale\" solution because it was the right design. (and of course the consultants and me got quite lot more work todo so made a good deal more money) reply mdasen 17 hours agorootparentprevAt this point you can get 24TB of RAM in an EC2 instance (along with 448 vCPUs, 100Gbps of network bandwidth and 38Gbps of EBS bandwidth). That won't scale forever, but Stack Overflow has been running on a single primary/standby setup with 1.5TB of RAM so that would be 16x Stack Overflow's RAM. I think a lot of work goes into horizontal scaling which is necessary at a certain scale, but very few people actually get anywhere near that scale. It can be important to understand which things are needed at your scale and where you can simply buy some beefier hardware. I've been at places where people run a dozen sharded DB servers with each server having 16GB of RAM. Maybe that's resume-driven-development where someone wants to say they've done that. reply SJC_Hacker 15 hours agorootparentA bunch of smaller distributed instances could be cheaper than one big one at equivalent size/compute. It also allows you to grow as needed, without worrying about things like DB transfer, instead of absorbing a big upfront cost. I agree it adds alot of complexity to the problem, which is another cost. I guess this would be another argument for pay-as-you go cloud-managed DBs, despite being more expensive than rolling your own. reply rbjorklin 14 hours agorootparentprevScaling horizontally undoubtedly introduces complexity but it also comes with some upsides: * DB backups are now (much) faster. * Smaller backups means faster restores which reduces your RTO (Recovery Time Objective) * If you have a well architectured application a catastrophic DB failure will now only impact a portion of your userbase instead of all of them. There are probably more good reasons but these are the ones I could think of now. reply mbreese 13 hours agorootparentIs high availability or easier backups why people look to horizontal scaling though? I don't think that's ever been a primary reason for any story I've read. It's a great \"bonus\", but I can't think that it would be a compelling reason to choose horizontal vs vertical scaling. (There are other reasons, of course...) reply hot_gril 11 hours agorootparentprevI remember using PG 10 at a previous company that was kinda abusing Postgres as a data processing tool with temp tables. Even with the parallel scans etc, we found it was a lot faster to split our queries (mostly INSERT(SELECT...)) into separate ones operating on separate ranges of rows, one for each CPU core. We'd run EXPLAIN to print out the plan then shard on the innermost or outermost join. I even implemented a huge sparse matrix addition/multiplication calculator this way, chaining multiple operations into a single huge query, far exceeding the limits of numpy. I've always wondered if Postgres could be used as a more efficient Spark backend. It usually scaled linearly. We had a 32-core (64-vcore) server, saturating all cores and running a bit more than 32x as fast as a single query. In some cases, it was less than linear but much better than singular, and I think that was only cause of mistakes like uuid4 pkeys. reply zht 15 hours agorootparentprevhow long does it take to unencrypted and back up your database at its current size? reply karlmdavis 20 hours agoparentprevFrom personal experience, it scales very well vertically. Have a system in production with tens of billions of rows and north of 12 TB of storage total. That system is read-heavy with large batched inserts, not many deletes or updates. Biggest limiter is memory, where the need for it grows linearly with table index size. Postgres really really wants to keep the index pages hot in the OS cache. Gets very sad and weird if it can’t: will unpredictably resort to table scans sometimes. We are running on AWS Aurora, on a db.r6i.12xlarge. Nowhere even close to maxed out on potential vertical scaling. reply brightball 19 hours agorootparentIsn’t Aurora horizontal by default? EDIT: Here's what I was thinking about. It's chunked in 10gb increments that are replicated across AZs. > Fault-tolerant and self-healing storage Aurora's database storage volume is segmented in 10 GiB chunks and replicated across three Availability Zones, with each Availability Zone persisting 2 copies of each write. Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Aurora storage is also self-healing; data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically. https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/features/ reply dalyons 19 hours agorootparentNo? it’s a standard single node primary with replicas setup. With a fancy log based storage layer. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 19 hours agorootparentprevI recently did some db maintenance on a write heavy workload and I found that eventually it will bloat over time with a table with 500 million records. Switching it to use a proper partitioning scheme helped a lot. So people should not read this and assume you can just dump massive workloads into pg and they will be screamingly performant without some tuning and thoughtful design (I don’t think this is what you are implying, just a PSA) reply riku_iki 16 hours agorootparentis there a chance you run some older version of PG?

It is hitting a hard limit of 250TB AWS can support. reply mrbonner 14 hours agorootparentNo, we do not store log or IoT. The data are all business related metrics. I didn't choose aurora but inherited from another team. We have 4 replication reads to scale out the read access. The internal team owns the ingestion (insert) to the write node. All other external accesses are read. I think the reason behind aurora pick is to support arbitrary aggregation, filtering and low latency read (p90High concurrency can become a problem due to the 1 process per connection architecture. If I understand correctly what you mean, then this is no longer a problem. You will simply need to use a connection pool, such as Odyssey or PgBouncer. Even SPQR has its own pool of connections for each shard. reply ManBeardPc 16 hours agorootparentPgBouncer just pools the connection, but each connection still needs its own process in PostgreSQL itself. Each query blocks the whole process. That limits the amount of queries that can run in parallel/concurrently to the amount of connections. Long-running queries can easily clog up everything. No tool can fix this, you need to be aware of it and consider it in your design. reply hot_gril 16 hours agorootparentIt's not really about the processes. Even if each query ran on a thread within a process, or some form of greenthreading were in use, there are I/O constraints and locking to consider. reply ManBeardPc 14 hours agorootparentWhat I talk about is blocking of limited resources. Processes/connections are expensive and therefore you want/have to limit the max amount of them. Each query/transaction requires its own process and blocks it for everyone else until it is done. I/O or compute constraints are another issue, if your CPU or disc is already saturated you get probably no additional benefit. But if you wait for something (locks, I/O) the connection/process can't do other things. High latency between app/database and long running transactions can also use up your available processes, even if they don't consume a lot of CPU or I/O or fight for the same locks. Lock contention is its own problem, but makes the blocking of processes/connections worse. reply hot_gril 11 hours agorootparentWhat I meant is, even if processes had no cost, you will probably bottleneck on the I/O. So it doesn't matter a lot how many Postgres connections you have. reply ManBeardPc 44 minutes agorootparentSure, it’s not the most common problem to experience, just something that’s useful to know once you have more and more clients. It did happen to me, all connections used up for long running transactions (for multiple reasons) and then nothing else was able to run, CPU and I/O nearly idling atNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.

We're excited to hear what you all think! w3news 13 hours agoWhen you build an API, please start with the OpenAPI specification, before you write any code for your API. It can be iterative, but for every part, just start with the OpenAPI, and think about what you want from the API, what do you want to send, and what to receive. It is like the TDD approach, design before build. Writing or generating tests after you build the code, is the same as this. It is guessing what it should do. The OpenAPI specification, and the tests should tell you what it should do, not the code. If you have the specification, everyone (and also AI) can write the code for you to make it work. But the specification is about what you think it should do. That are the questions and requirements that you have about the system. reply brosciencecode 12 hours agoparentI get the feeling you may not have gone 0-1 on an API before. In general, you have 1 consumer when you're starting off, and if you're lucky your API gathers more consumers over time. In that initial implementation period, it's more time-consuming to have to update a spec nobody uses. Maintaining specs separately from your actual code is also a great way to get into situations where your map != your territory. I'd instead ask: support and use API frameworks that allow you to automatically generate OpenAPI specs, or make a lot of noise to get frameworks that don't support generating specs to support that feature. Don't try to maintain OpenAPI specs without automation :) reply Karrot_Kream 10 hours agorootparentHow is adding 10-20 lines, depending on how many structures you're creating, and then re-running a generation tool (or simply just running a build command again depending on your build configuration) time consuming? I've written OpenAPI-first services both at Big Tech for services handling crazy amounts of RPS and at tiny seed startups where we release the API and literally nobody uses it but our app. Sure I've run up against the occasional sharp edge/incompatibility with some form of nested structure and the generator we used but it was usually a minor diversion and represented 20-30 min of wasted time for the occasional badly-behaving endpoint. I'm even writing a side project now where I'm defining the API using OpenAPI and then running a generator for the echo Go framework to generate the actual API endpoints. It takes just a few minutes to create a new API. reply refulgentis 8 hours agorootparentThey are advocating for exactly that: \"I'd instead ask: support and use API frameworks that allow you to automatically generate OpenAPI specs reply rad_gruchalski 10 hours agorootparentprevI don’t agree with you. Write a spec, use generators to generate your servers and clients, and use those generated objects yourself. The point is twofold: you test your API immediately AND you get a ton of boilerplate generated. So many products out there just feel like a bunch of separate things with a spec slapped on top. Sometimes the spec doesn’t make sense. For example, the same property across different endpoints having a different type. Save yourself time and do it right from the get go. > Maintaining specs separately from your actual code is also a great way to get into situations where your map != your territory. So yeah, write your spec once and generate all servers and clients from it… reply tevon 11 hours agorootparentprevI agree with this as well! OpenAPI spec seems intended to be consumed, not written. Its a great way to convey what your API does, but is pretty awful to write from scratch. I do wish there was a simpler language to write in... JSON-based as well that would allow this approach of writing the spec first. But alas, there is not, and I have looked a loooot. If anyone has suggestions for other spec languages I'd love to learn! reply Petermarcu 6 hours agorootparenthttp://typespec.io reply BillyTheKing 5 hours agorootparentoh thanks a lot for sharing - I was looking for something just like this! Something like this + hurl is the perfect combination to sketch out APIs imo reply Falimonda 8 hours agorootparentprevSimpler than YAML? reply paholg 12 hours agoparentprevI don't want to write OpenApi. Yaml is a terrible programming language, and keeping it in sync with actual code is always a nightmare. I've been using a tool to generate OpenApi from code, and am pretty happy with that workflow. Even if writing the API before logic, I'd much rather write the types and endpoints in a real programming language, and just have a `todo` in the body. You can still write API-driven code without literally writing OpenApi first. reply BerislavLopac 1 hour agorootparentYou are correct about YAML, but OpenAPI is not YAML -- it just commonly uses it as for the textual representation. As others mentioned it, JSON is an alternative, although it doesn't make it much easier to write the code directly. Sadly, there is a distinct lack of tools to make spec-first development easier. At the moment, Stoplight [0] is the only game in town as a high quality schema editor, but it requires payment for any more significant usage.

But as some comments below point out, an OpenAPI spec is a pain to create manually which is why TypeSpec from Microsoft is such a great tool. Lets you focus on the important bits of creating a solid API (model, consistency, best practices) in an easy to use DSL that spits out a fully documented OpenAPI spec to build against! see https://typespec.io/ reply physicsguy 1 hour agoparentprevI prefer going the other direction in practice, autogenerating the spec from the code e.g. with drf-spectacular for Django. reply enobrev 7 hours agoparentprevThe API library I wrote for my last couple projects required the developer to fill in the openapi spec specifics and said spec was the part of the API itself, making it difficult to add something to the API that wasn't also in the spec. Incoming request params, became validated and casted object properties. Outgoing response params were validated and casted according to spec. In the end I think it worked really well, and loved not needing to maintain the spec separately. The annoying bit was adjusting the library when the spec changed. And some gnarly bits of the spec that weren't easy to implement logically. At any rate, it also made for a similar experience of considering the client experience while writing/maintaining the api. reply tkiolp4 12 hours agoparentprevWhat’s wrong with designing an API by writing its code? Code itself is a design tool (and usually any decent programming language is a better design tool than YAML) reply spondylosaurus 11 hours agorootparentAs someone who documents APIs: it's easy to tell which APIs were designed with intention and which ones were designed on the fly. In part because it's much, much easier to document the former :) reply yashap 12 hours agoparentprevI completely agree as a general design principle, but I still think there’s a place for the above tool. Example: I used to work at a place that had a massive PHP monolith, developed by hundreds of devs over the course of a decade, and it was the worst pile of hacky spaghetti code I’ve ever seen. Unsurprisingly, it had no API spec. We were later doing tonnes of work to clean it up, which included plans to add an API spec, and switch to a spec-first design process (which we were already doing in services split from the monolith), but there was a massive existing surface area to spec out first. A tool like this would’ve been useful to get a first draft of the API spec up and running quickly for this huge legacy backend. reply madeofpalk 10 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately OpenAPI specs suck to write manually. Generating OpenAPI spec from the server code has always felt significantly better for me. reply pattycakes 8 hours agoparentprevWaste of time imo if you use a framework like fastapi which generates the spec for you reply ramraj07 7 hours agorootparentExactly this, I’ve been a python guy which is apparently not the main language used by most api developers or what? Is there nothing like FastAPI in js land? I do start my APIs by writing the openAPI spec, only it’s written in pydantic inside FastAPI and turns out this also creates the actual API lol. reply mdasen 12 hours agoparentprevAs a curiosity, how do you feel about languages/frameworks where APIs can be pretty self-documenting? For example, Java/JAX-RS creates pretty self-documenting APIs: @Path(\"/people\") public class PeopleApi { @Path(\"{personId}\") @GET public Person getPerson(@PathParam(\"personId\") int personId) { return db.getPerson(personId); } } It's easy to generate a spec for a JAX-RS class because it has the paths, parameters, types, etc. right there. There's a GET at /people/{personId} which returns a Person and takes a path parameter personId which is an integer. If we're talking about a Go handler which doesn't have that information easily accessible, I understand wanting to start with a spec: func GetPerson(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { personId, _ := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Path.something) person := db.GetPerson(personId) w.Write(json.marshal(person)) } func GetPerson(c echo.Context) error { //or with something like Echo/Gin id := c.Param(\"id\") person := db.GetPerson(id) return c.Json(http.StatusOK, person) } In Go's case, there's nothing which can tell me what the method takes as input without being able to reason about the whole method. With JAX-RS, it's easy reflect on the method signature and see what it takes as input and what it gives back, but that's not available with Go (with the Go tools that most people are using). This isn't meant as a Go/Java debate, but more a question of whether some languages/frameworks basically already give you the spec you need to the point where you can easily generate an OpenAPI spec from the method definition. Part of that is that the language has types and part of it is the way JAX-RS does things such that things you're grabbing from the request become method parameters before the method is called rather than the method just taking a request object. JAX-RS makes you define what you want to send and what you want to receive in the method signature. I totally agree that people should start with thinking about what they want from an API, what to send, and what to receive. But is starting with OpenAPI something that would be making up for languages/frameworks that don't do development in that way naturally? ---------- Just to show I'm not picking on Go, I'm pretty sure one could create a Go framework more like this, I just haven't seen it: type GetPersonRequest struct { Request `path:/people/{personId}` PersonId int `param:path` } func GetPerson(personRequest GetPersonRequest) Person { return db.GetPerson(personRequest.PersonId) } I think you'd have to have the request object because Go can annotate struct fields (with struct tags), but can't annotate method parameters or functions (but I could be wrong). The point is that most languages/frameworks don't have the spec information in the code in an easy way to reflect on like JAX-RS, ASP.NET APIs, and some others do. reply thiht 1 hour agorootparentI absolutely hate the approach of scattering routing instructions everywhere via annotations. Nothing beats a router.go file with all the endpoints declared in the same place. Routing annotations is a bad idea that caught up just because it looks clever. Looking for the handler for ˋGET /foo/{fooID}/barˋ is terrible in a codebase using annotations. reply avolpe 9 hours agorootparentprevFor the happy path, the Java code works great, but a good open API spec also includes the following: - examples, they are a pain to write in Java annotations. - multiple responses, ok, invalid id, not found, etc. - good descriptions, you can write descriptions in annotations (particularly post Java 14) but they are overly verbose. - validations, you can use bean validation, but if you implement the logic in code it's not easy to add that to the generated spec. See for example this from springfox https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox... It's overly verbose and the generated open API spec is not very good. reply steve_rambo 1 hour agorootparentYou don't need annotations for descriptions, they get picked up from javadoc-style comments which you should have anyway. Same with asp.net. reply boredtofears 8 hours agorootparentprevyour example doesn't look any worse than an openapi yaml spec given how easy/frequently you can reach 10+ identation levels for a trivial spec. you might be able to add descriptions easily, but expressing types in yaml is much more verbose than in a decently typed language. reply jpalawaga 6 hours agorootparentprevswaggest allows you to define your inputs and outputs, and generate docs from them. reply radicality 9 hours agoprevI’ve only glanced at the code on mobile, but am I reading this right?

Let's not forget, though, that one of the goals of OpenAPI is to serve as a design and documentation artifact in design-first API development; generating OpenAPI from code or, as in this case, from network traffic, is an interesting complement and something you can use to test the implementation against the design. reply adawg4 12 hours agoparentIt makes sense, and we love API-first companies.

Search the html of the main page for anchor tags. Add the links in those tags to an array as your exploration frontier. Once done parsing that html, load the next link. Add deduplication to avoid loops and just run a depth-first search. What am I missing? reply somethingAlex 13 hours agorootparentFor brochure / static content sites this is definitely the beginnings of a web crawler but it can be a lot trickier for web apps. For example, clicking a link which loads some data, then clicking edit (which isn't even an anchor), typing in & clicking stuff, then clicking the save button (don't click the cancel button!) would not be an interaction that would get picked up with your suggestion. Detecting loops becomes much more ambiguous and backtracking to get all the permutations of interactions becomes a whole other problem to solve. reply dns_snek 13 hours agorootparentprevIn many web apps there are going to be buttons and links that are not represented as . You would realistically have to enumerate everything that has any kind of event handler attached since it could potentially trigger an API call. You would also have to fill and submit forms with valid and invalid data. You would have to toggle checkboxes, change radio buttons, click buttons, (e.g. \"Apply filters\" after changing values in a product filter section), and generally go through many combinations of inputs to find all valid parameters and possible responses. reply adawg4 15 hours agoparentprevOpen to ideas! We're thinking of adding agents/crawler suggestions to the github if there's a package that clicks around in that fashion reply samstave 12 hours agorootparentForgive the naive question, but to pair with the GP, thoughts: 1. Wouldnt this also be helpful in understanding the exact nature of all traffic/calls against a particular page, user-workflow matriculating through your site from a UX perspective? 2. Could one make a proxy from this on a local home egress such that you could see the nature of outbound network traffic to site you visit (more importantly, traffic heading to 3rd-party trackers/cookies' APIs via your site visits? 3.

It would parse each line into a structure then merge the same call point structures down to one spec. It was helpful to see the api but in the end was not that helpful in back filling the openapi spec. things to consider: - junk data from users will show up. unless your downstream service rejects extra params users will mess with you. - it documents each endpoint but its harder to say if this \"user\" data is the same as another's endpoints \"user\" - it is hard to tell if users are hitting all endpoint inputs/outputs without manual review. reply bigiain 10 hours agoparentDoesn't look like this tool is intended to be deployed into production where \"junk data from users\" would be encountered. My impression is it's a localhost proxy which only ever sees deliberate test traffic from the developer who's running it on their own machine. (Although I'd be curious to see something very similar to this running in prod and generating WAF rules and/or alerting on suspicious requests.

Generating the spec from code removes a step, where you simply need to update code, rather than update the spec then update the code reply simplesager 7 hours agorootparent [–] Completely agree.

The tool will try to request sensitive files by trying something as simple as fetching hxxps://example.com/../../../etc/passwd. If you return a \"200 OK\", it will flag as a security issue, even if the resulting data isn't a passwd file. I don't think you can convince me that returning a 200 OK and some default content for a URL that doesn't exist is ever the correct thing to do. If you want to use 301 or 302 to redirect them to the front page, that's probably fine, but the most correct thing to do is 404. reply hombre_fatal 17 hours agoparentTripping up hare-brained security scanning tools sounds like a perk tbh. > I don't think you can convince me that [...] is ever the correct thing to do It's just a matter of trade-offs. Serving the app.js on a 404 can cause things like browser/caching issues that are confusing for the user, and 404 isn't necessarily correct since the app is both servable and recoverable from that url. And I'm not sure 302-redirecting is any less meaningless than serving 200 on a not-found. The user doesn't need the redirect since the app is already capable of handling the not-found page in a user-friendly way. So does it somehow improve things for programmatic analysis of the app to make all 40X errors redirect to the homepage, and is that very compelling? reply Sohcahtoa82 14 hours agorootparent> Tripping up hare-brained security scanning tools sounds like a perk tbh. Heh, not a bad criticism. Though TBH, I think all DAST tools are hare-brained. They get sold as automated penetration tests, but they really can't figure out SPAs at all, since they often only look at the immediate response to an HTTP request, when often, you'd need to see exactly what the JS code does with the response and how it gets rendered in the page. Maybe a PUT/POST request to upload data returns a blank 200 OK, but only a follow-up GET request will actually show the result. They end up with more false negatives than false positives. At best, they'll catch the low-hanging fruits involving missing headers that often lead to Beg Bounties like Clickjacking or missing HSTS. The only reason DAST still exists is because compliance frameworks still list it as a checkbox. Otherwise, I think they're pretty useless. reply eddd-ddde 15 hours agorootparentprevIf I make a typo and get a 200 for some url that doesn't actually exist, my browser will now happily suggest that url when I'm typing something in the future. Is there a benefit for doing so? reply shawabawa3 15 hours agorootparentIt's not a benefit but a side effect of client side routing If your main routing logic is in your JS app your server can't know if a route exists or not unless you duplicate routing code across front end and backend reply antihero 15 hours agorootparentprevWell client side routing is fundamentally broken unless you do serve a 200 and the index reply shkkmo 14 hours agorootparentYou only have to serve a 200 and the index for valid routes to have frontend routing working. The complaint is serving a 200 for invalid routes, which breaks all kinds of things and violates web standards. reply egeozcan 14 hours agorootparentIndeed, for a cost-effective approach with a static host, why not generate placeholder HTML files for all valid routes at compile time? Alternatively, using Astro or a similar tool would be a wise choice :) reply antihero 13 hours agorootparentThis isn’t really feasible, think about how dynamic routes can be? Can you generate a route for every ID of a thing? reply eddd-ddde 13 hours agorootparentI have actually seen this approach for SSG. You define a function to get all IDs, then the framework renders all of the pages using those. reply __jonas 17 hours agoparentprevBut if it's an SPA, how else would you handle this case? How is the webserver supposed to know in advance which URLs the SPA is able to handle? reply Sohcahtoa82 15 hours agorootparentI'm confused here. What defines the \"webserver\" versus the \"the SPA\"? The way I've implemented SPAs is to run nginx. All my JS and CSS is in /static/ and served up by nginx. \"/\" returns an index.html. \"/api/*\" gets forwarded to a back end of some sort, usually Python's Bottle because it's lightweight and simple to use. If the route doesn't exist, Bottle returns a 404. If I have an endpoint that includes an ID of some sort in the URL, like /api/getobject/12345, but you request an object that doesn't exist, then I still return a 404. How are you implementing SPAs in a way that you can't return a 404? reply MrJohz 14 hours agorootparentA lot of SPAs do some level of client-side routing, so that if you open up the SPA and click on a link, rather than directing you to a different page, the app instead updates the URL with Javascript and renders the content of the new page. There are various benefits and drawbacks to this approach, but it's quite common, and you can find tools like React Router that are designed to support this client-side routing. The problem is that when you only serve your app from `/`, and then the user navigates via the app to `/user/123`, the url gets updated, but if the user tries to reload the page, they'll end up on a 404 page because you're not serving the app from `/user/123`. There's a few ways to solve this, each again with tradeoffs, but one way is to have the server return 200 and the contents of the main page any time that the user requests an unknown route, under the assumption that the user is probably trying to navigate to a dynamic route handled by the frontend. reply __jonas 14 hours agorootparentprev> How are you implementing SPAs in a way that you can't return a 404? Not specifically me, but a lot of SPAs have their own routing. So you would go to https://my-spa.com/user/39820002/post/39811155 When you hit that route, the webserver returns /index.html with the JS bundle, the JS runs and matches the user ID and post ID from the URL and then maybe makes some API requests to fetch content of whatever, I mean the SPA doesn't have to be backed by an API anyways, could be purely static but still use a router. In the React world, react-router is (was) pretty popular: https://github.com/remix-run/react-router That's a library that works exactly that way, relying on every route being passed to the JS bundle for handling, so the webserver needs to be configured to never return 404 and just return the index.html for every route, here is an example of what this looks like from the docs of Caddy, another popular webserver with a pretty easy to understand config format: https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/patterns#single-page-... It's a \"Single Page App\", you may have many pages being rendered by this app, but it's a single html page that is responsible for doing this. Now – SPAs are not as popular as they used to be, and there is an argument to be made that they aren't the best solution in most cases with what's available now, regardless of that they do exist and this appears to be a web server specifically for them so having the option handle SPA routing as it's commonly done, does make sense. And I think for stuff like internal management apps, admin panels etc. SPAs with their own routing are still a decent solution. reply Sohcahtoa82 14 hours agorootparentAhhh...I see what you're saying. So like, if you're on my-spa.com, and click a link to a post, the JS loads the post and updates the URL, but doesn't perform a full page load. So while you might be on https://my-spa.com/user/39820002/post/39811155, your browser likely never actually sent a GET request to /user/39820002/post/39811155. But this creates the issue that if you manually navigate to that URL, your browser WILL send a request for it. In that case, yeah, I think the correct thing to do is to return the 200 OK with your usual index.html. When the JS makes the API requests, those requests should return a 404, and the JS will then render a page that says \"That post doesn't exist\" or something. But in the case of a request that couldn't possibly exist, like a GET request for /etc/passwd, they should still be 404s. Any router should be able to do that. EDIT: I think a better way to do this hold thing is to make the resource an anchor tag in the URL. Instead of https://my-spa.com/user/39820002/post/39811155, make it https://my-spa.com/#user/39820002/post/39811155 reply __jonas 13 hours agorootparent> So like, if you're on my-spa.com, and click a link to a post, the JS loads the post and updates the URL, but doesn't perform a full page load.

Instead of https://my-spa.com/user/39820002/post/39811155, make it https://my-spa.com/#user/39820002/post/39811155 As someone else said: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39819120 Hash routes have their own problems, I don't think they are a great solution, but indeed SPA routers often support them, example from react router: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/router-components/hash-route... Note that they strongly suggest to not use hash routing unless you have no other choice. I agree that returning 200 to every route isn't great for some scenarios, but realistically, SPAs exist, they usually work like this and they are deployed like this, can't really change that now. I would just not build an SPA with client side routing at this point in time since there are solutions that I personally prefer, other people may think differently though. reply antihero 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah I mean SPAs still make lots of sense for web based applications, of which there are many. They make bugger all sense for websites, of course. I wouldn’t say they are declining in popularity, more like declining in overuse. Also it is nice to be able to cleanly implement SPAs in such a way that the server itself is doing as little work as possible for cost and scale. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentprev> they aren't the best solution in most cases with what's available now What's available now that superceds them? reply __jonas 14 hours agorootparentWell I suppose that's subjective, I probably put my bias in there but I would say: For mostly static or content driven sites, there are really nice static site generators now. I find Astro[1] really pleasant to use, offering the convenience of SPA framework tooling, while allowing me to build sites that run without the need for any client-side JavaScript but the option to into client-side JS as needed. But also NextJS has a similar static export function, and of course there are many other great SSGs outside the JavaScript world like Hugo. For dynamic web applications like the example from my comment I would just do server side rendering using your language and framework of choice, Phoenix, Rails, Next, Django, whatever. In both cases the issue with 404 routes is avoided. [1] https://astro.build/ reply shkkmo 14 hours agorootparentprev> What's available now that superceds them? The mostly same stuff as before, but slightly better. SPAs were a fad that got very popular, but they were generally a poor solution in most cases and as the fad faded, they stopped being as overused. One of the reasons why SPAs are bad solution is because they interfere with how the web works in significant ways (browser history, caching, server response statuses) and solving those issues without degrading user experience is hard. When a SPA was actually useful, it was worth spending the time to solve those issues. The overuse of SPAs means that most of them did not take the time to solve these issues properly so most SPAs sucked (and still do). This is why I don't understand releasing a SPA server in 2024 that doesn't even try to provide tools to solve those issues. reply ch_sm 16 hours agorootparentprevI typically keep all my SPA routes/route names in a single JSON, and then reference those from the App, instead of repeating the routes everywhere. I can then pass those to the server to let it know what the SPA can handle. reply antihero 16 hours agorootparentThis is an opinionated approach that is out of scope really I think. Though if it works for you, awesome! reply boredtofears 8 hours agorootparentI'd say not handling 404's correctly and simply returning a 200 OK is pretty opinionated, too. reply shkkmo 14 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure what is 'opinionated' about this approach. It seems like a pretty standard and reasonable way of correctly serving an SPA in a way that doesn't violate web standards. reply __jonas 12 hours agorootparentSo this would mean you would have to dynamically generate your webservers configuration at the build time of your SPA? And then how are you handling routes with params inside? In your SPA they would probably be configured like /user/:id/post/:post Now you would have to translate that to something the webserver config understands, probably wildcard / glob pattern / regex stuff and splice that into the web server config? I mean it's possible, sure, but that's a lot of overhead and room for error just to deploy a simple SPA, it definitely is an opinionated approach. reply withinboredom 12 hours agorootparentI don’t know.

It sounds pretty simple really, it’s probably less than a week to build something rock solid. reply phanimahesh 16 hours agorootparentprevHandle a prefix maybe? reply antihero 16 hours agoparentprevBut how could this possibly be correct if the route is correct within the context of the client side code which uses history API to route, which the server knows nothing about?

Single index.html file. Written entirely in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with zero dependencies whatsoever. Project \"pages\" are fullscreen slideshows of high-rez images (3200x2000) etc. So basically a handcrafted static site. Would buying a virtual server and running any one of these mini servers to run your site make it more performant than throwing it on a regular host like Dreamhost?

Be careful: SPAs can handle 404s client-side. All you need to do is continue to return the 404 result code and include the same exact content that you normally do. Then your SPA recognizes that the route isn't set up and displays the error page. reply antihero 18 hours agoparentI could certainly add this as a configuration option! Generally an SPA could do this by simply not having that route and handle accordingly but if it's something people would be interesting it is a quick change. Perhaps make a ticket/PR and I can look into adding it :) That said, thinking about it - the server has no idea whether a client side route is actually correct. You could have https://example.com/potato/tomato which will not exist on the server of course, but will be handled by client side JS on /index.html and could be a correct route within the app, so it is safer to 200 it. SPAs aren't really generally made for SEO also. With something like Astro which is SEO friendly, it could actually return a 200 as expected and a 404 if not. reply kijin 18 hours agoparentprevYep, returning the wrong HTTP status code is going to confuse a lot of search engines, chat app link previews, and other automated consumers of your SPA, even if you subsequently display the correct error page. reply floydnoel 11 hours agorootparenteasy enough to solve with Prerender. when using it I include some head tags to allow the Prerender server to send codes like 404 or 301.

I wrote something similar long ago inserving things like Astro from S3 Given that point, I got the impression that the comparison was against loading resources from S3. The difference between that and serving from memory (even between that and serving from uncached traditional hard-drive) is going to be significant. EDIT: cursory research suggests S3 latency (https://stackoverflow.com/a/861539/114292, being the most recent reference that turned up) is smaller than it was last time I remember needing to look into it, but still of the order of 10+ms. reply antihero 16 hours agorootparentYeah I see this as a viable alternative to serving from S3 (I mean, which is still a great option I recommend provided you aren’t exposing S3 directly and set up S3 properly locked down) but the original niche was having an SPA web interface that runs on a k8s cluster as part of wider service where you want a tiny minimal and fast image that can be configurable when the pod is spun up.

Eg if your site is www.example.com and you have a SPA on there, and one of the pages is www.example.com/products, you want to still serve index.html from the root even though the /products path is not a real directory on your system. If you don’t serve for this URL then it’ll work fine locally but if someone hard-refreshes or shares the link, it won’t load. reply somethingAlex 16 hours agorootparentIf you are using Cludfront with an S3 origin you can turn on static website hosting and specify a 404 fallback page[0] - which would then just be your index file. It will render your client code and let you show a 404 if it is indeed one. The problem is that essentially every time a user goes to the site it will be a 404 status code since they are probably not typing in example.com/index but this has pragmatically not been an issue for a wholly authenticated, private, B2B SaaS app. The marketing website is a separate subdomain. For a public site this is probably worse than returning 200s that should be 404s occasionally, though.

I think the Web lacks two major things: 1) Address resolution only uses federated DNS and you need extensions to use, say, self-sovereign Web3 domains which can’t be stolen 2) There is NO WAY to load files by their content hash like onion links in Tor.

    "title": "Meta Suspends Business Over $40K Charge",
    "originLink": "https://tidbyt.com/blogs/tidbyt/meta-takes-40k-holds-our-business-ransom",
    "originBody": "Meta takes $40K, holds our business ransom ROHAN SINGH MARCH 25, 2024 Meta takes $40K, holds our business ransom tl;dr: Meta charged my credit card $40K for advertising, somehow lost track of the money, and has now suspended our account unless we wire them $40K more. When you’re running a small business, you always hear horror stories from fellow founders about dealing with large platform companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple. Depending on your business, working with these platforms ranges from “convenient” to “existentially necessary”. In our case, Tidbyt is a very visual consumer product, making it a great fit for Instagram. Our potential customers are on Instagram and Facebook, so we really have to be there too. In fact, since launch, we’ve paid Meta literal millions of dollars for advertising on these platforms. Given the size of our account, and the fact that I’m a former Facebook employee, we figured things would be fine — and they more or less have been. Ad performance has declined a bit, but hasn’t it for everyone? It also bothered me that we’ve never been assigned an account manager or given a phone number to call for issues, but that seems to be an extremely standard experience as well. Once our account got large enough, Meta switched us to monthly invoicing and we continued to have a good working relationship for a couple years. Until… Pay by credit card? Sure, why not. Some time last year, Meta added the option to pay invoices by credit card. It’s not rocket science, you just click “Pay” in their billing portal and enter your credit card. It gets charged. We tried the credit card payment option for the first time last month. My card was charged, the invoice state updated to “Processing”. Strangely, the portal didn’t provide a PDF receipt or anything, but Meta’s ad platform is known to be fairly buggy. A little while later, we got an email from Meta with a vaguely scary message: Your account is 16 days past due and is at risk of being placed on a collections hold. Payment instructions are included at the bottom of each invoice. If you've recently paid this balance, please send payment remittance advice to payment@fb.com so we can make sure to credit your account promptly. Bummer, but probably just a mix up? Checking my card, it had definitely been charged, and the charge had even been finalized. We responded with a screenshot of the Amex statement and once again figured that was it. But 8 days later, we got another email from a “collections analyst”, and it became pretty clear that the collections analyst didn’t even realize that credit card payments were possible. They asked for things like an “MT103 document” and “payment advise document”. Those are the kinds of receipts you get when you send a wire transfer from a bank, but obviously we didn’t have them since I paid via credit card through Meta’s own website. This dance continued about once a week, with a new email from Meta, promises from the analyst to call us by phone (they never did), and a new response from us with the credit card statement. By this point we’d actually even settled the credit card bill with Amex. The last we’d heard from Meta was a week ago, and I sent over the final PDF transaction statement from Amex. Ironic how the credit card statement includes a link to metacareers.com 🙃 And nope, that phone number doesn’t go anywhere. I know people at Meta, right? Fearing the worst, I personally started reaching out to alumni and employees at Facebook. Like come on, I worked there for a couple years, y’all know me and we can get this figured out, right? Definitely nepotism, but when the entire business is on the line, I’m willing to pull every available lever. Sadly the only actionable advice we got was to open a case with Meta’s business support. I did that, and the chat support rep was clearly not able to deal with this kind of issue. The rep gave me a link and asked me to fill out a support form to reach support… but it was the exact same form I’d just filled out to start a chat with them. When that didn’t work, they asked me to file a bug/feedback report. I filed the bug report, but those reports clearly state “we can't personally respond to everyone”. Totally the wrong channel. And of course, the support case I originally opened is now closed as “completed”. Your Meta ad account has been disabled. This morning at 3 AM, we got an email saying that our account has been disabled: Dear Tidbyt, Inc., Your Meta ad account was placed on a collections hold for overdue invoices totaling USD 37,216.17. Your account has been disabled and is currently inactive. To reactive your credit line, we must receive payment for the past due balance. I responded one more time, and got the same response from the same collections analyst: We apologize for the inconvenience caused, upon checking from our side we haven't received the payment that you have made via Credit Card. We request you check with your bank side and give me an update on the payment status. But again, there’s nothing more to check on our end since we paid through Meta’s own portal. When we paid via credit card, Meta’s payment processor charged the card for $37K and would have sent that money to Meta’s bank account. So Meta is sitting on $37K, but has disabled our account because they can’t seem to be bothered to find it. If we want to reactivate our account, we have to double-pay and directly wire transfer them another $37K. Otherwise we’re dead in the water. This kills the business. I get the inherent risk of relying on a third-party platform for a large chunk of your business, I really do. It keeps me up at night and we’ve definitely invested in alternatives where possible. But in a lot of ways, Meta is the marketplace. Running a consumer retail business without an Instagram presence… it’s kind of like trying to build a consumer phone app without working with Apple and Google. Sure, you could try to reinvent the entire ecosystem and marketplace with unlimited time & money, but even Amazon failed when they tried that. What makes it even worse for us is that we base our manufacturing and inventory on sales forecasts. It’s only been 12 hours since our Instagram and Facebook ad accounts were blipped, but we’re already seeing a drop in traffic and sales. We’ll certainly try to course correct, but it’s going to be very, very difficult. “Just do a chargeback.” One advantage of having paid with a credit card is that we could dispute the charge with Amex. This is a nuclear option since it has a number of risks: Will we win the dispute? Once we dispute the charge, the bank has months to investigate and render a final decision. There’s always a chance that they could side with Meta, and then we’d never see that money back. In the meantime we would still have to pay Meta another $37K to reactivate the account. Will Meta permanently close our accounts? If we file a chargeback, then $37K will immediately be withdrawn by the credit card processor from Meta’s account. I promise you, somebody at Meta is going to notice $40K leaving their account, and I have no idea how they would respond. They could permanently close our ad accounts, suspend our organic accounts, or even suspend our personal accounts. No way to know. Fire and motion. Over 20 years ago, Joel Spolsky wrote a great essay that’s always stuck with me, Fire And Motion. In it, he talks about “cover fire”: If you are moving forward, writing code and fixing bugs constantly, time is on your side. Watch out when your competition fires at you. Do they just want to force you to keep busy reacting to their volleys, so you can’t move forward? When large platform companies throw us for loops like these, it’s a form of cover fire. Instead of spending the day moving our company forward, I’m instead dealing with this curveball that Meta has thrown at us. Obviously, there isn’t somebody at Meta who is intentionally trying to make our lives difficult because they see Tidbyt as some sort of strategic threat (lol). But organizations will eventually evolve to reproduce the conditions that favor their continued existence and growth. When Meta has a payments issue that isn’t anyone’s priority to solve, when Google Cloud decides to deprecate another product with short notice, when Apple throws out new App Store rules… these are all cover fire. Even if the underlying intentions are genuine, the effect is that the rest of us spend more time reacting and less time innovating. I’m not sure what the answer is, but man, do I really wish I hadn’t tried to pay that invoice with a credit card.

They clearly don't recognise your credit card payment, so the chargeback can't reasonably get you in trouble either. If the notice the chargeback at all, at least they'll figure out that you did pay them after all. I'd use the payment method you used before, because that always worked, and then chargeback the old payment that clearly didn't work. How are they going to side with Facebook when you've got all that documentation that they don't recognise that payment? reply ivraatiems 14 hours agoparentAmex might very well take the OP's side, and they'd be right to. Credit card companies typically want to protect their customers and are predisposed to help them in matters like this. However, they have absolutely no control over what Meta does after that. They can't force Meta to keep doing business with the OP, even if the reason for terminating business is \"I want to punish OP for taking 40k from my account that I didn't think was there.\" Editing to add: One avenue that would probably work fairly well would be to get a lawyer to send a mean letter to Meta's general counsel. $40k is enough money to make the hourly rate worth it, and an attorney will be happy to help further if Meta tries to be punitive. reply htrp 14 hours agorootparent>Editing to add: One avenue that would probably work fairly well would be to get a lawyer to send a mean letter to Meta's general counsel. $40k is enough money to make the hourly rate worth it, and an attorney will be happy to help further if Meta tries to be punitive.

Seems like a good solution to me. reply rohansingh 14 hours agoparentprevI'm definitely considering it but trying to make sure we fully, thoroughly exhaust all other channels. Totally agree that it wouldn't be \"reasonable\" to permanently suspend our account for a chargeback in this scenario, but it's hard to know what's reasonable at this point. Sucks to say it but having to double-pay this invoice may still be a better scenario than having the business fully banned from Meta Ads. reply mcv 1 hour agorootparentIn any case, I think the worst option is to let Facebook cancel your account and not doing the chargeback. I'm not an expert on finances at all, but I'd pay using the old method, then chargeback. If they then cancel your account, they'd have to repay the new payment too, and I think someone there would start wondering why the hell they're cancelling you then. reply oneshtein 14 hours agorootparentprevPay again then chargeback previous payment. You have full right to chargeback extra money. reply rohansingh 14 hours agorootparentIt's not possible to pay by credit card again — just get a generic error when trying to open the payment form. So it would have to be by wire transfer, for which there are no chargeback protections. reply nocoiner 14 hours agorootparentRight, but, pay by wire to settle what Meta thinks is outstanding, and then initiate the chargeback process. At least during the pendency of that process, you’ll have that wire transfer documentation that seems to be the only thing Meta can comprehend, and you can (hopefully, fingers crossed, get back up and running). I get that there’s a real risk here that you could wind up out another $40k at the end of the day and your problem still isn’t solved, but if losing access to the Meta market is as fundamental a risk to the business as I took away from the post, then it seems to me like job one is to ensure that the business survives and that the (admittedly unpleasant) process of getting trued-up on the $40k is exactly the kind of thing that your lawyer is for. reply rohansingh 14 hours agorootparentYou're probably right. We can hopefully get back the money, but there's no getting back the lost revenue. Missed the wire cutoff for today but guess I know what I'll be doing tomorrow. reply nocoiner 14 hours agorootparentIt seems like a truly crappy situation, and I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this.

If you need that account don’t charge back. reply mcv 1 hour agorootparentIf you can't do chargebacks anyway, then what's the point of even using a credit card for this? reply rohansingh 12 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the heads-up.

A couple of times in my life, I've had good luck contacting the office of Chairpman of the Board.

I asked for the Chairman of the Board's office, and talked to his assistant. I explained the situation about how I was being lied to by the debt collector, the assistant arranged to have the debt recalled to American Express, and I worked w/ Amex directly after that. Another time, also w/ Amex, my friend's consulting invoice wasn't being paid my Amex in a timely manner. I recommended she contact them using the same approach, and an assistant helped her get paid.
