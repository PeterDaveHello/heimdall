    "originBody": "FROM: ROBIN SLOAN TO: THE LAB SENT: FEBRUARY 2020 AN APP CAN BE A HOME-COOKED MEAL Have you heard about this new app called BoopSnoop? It launched in the first week of January 2020, and almost immediately, it was down­loaded by four people in three different time zones. In the years since, it has remained steady at four daily active users, with zero churn: a resounding success, exceeding every one of its creator’s expectations. 🙂 I made a messaging app for, and with, my family. It is ruth­lessly simple; we love it; no one else will ever use it. I wanted to share a few notes about how and why I made it, both to (a) offer a nudge to anyone else consid­ering a similar project, and (b) suggest something a little larger about software. Tap or click to unmute. Barely there My story begins with another app, now defunct, called Tapstack. Opening the app, you saw a live feed from your phone’s camera. Below, a grid of faces, some of them representing individuals, others repre­senting groups. My grid had four cells: my mom, my dad, my sister, and a group collecting all three. Just like Snapchat or Instagram, you tapped to capture a photo, pressed to record a video. As soon as you lifted your finger, your message zipped away, with no editing, no reviewing. A “stack” of messages awaited you in the corner, and, after you tapped through them, they were discarded. It was all so simple that it was barely there. Tapstack more closely approx­i­mated a clear pane of glass than any app I’ve ever used. For several years, Tapstack was the main channel for my family’s communication. The app didn’t lend itself to practical corre­spon­dence or logis­tical coordination; its strength was ambient presence. I met one of Tapstack’s designers once, and they told me it seemed espe­cially popular with far-flung families: a diaspora app. Because there was no threading and no history, messages didn’t carry the burden of an expected reply. Really, they were just a carrier wave for another sentiment, and that sentiment was always the same: I’m thinking of you. A selfie with coffee, a picture of an ice-covered pond, a video of my nephews acting silly: I’m thinking of you, I’m thinking of you, I’m thinking of you. It never seemed to me that Tapstack attracted a huge number of users. I don’t know if the company ever made a cent. There was no adver­tising in the app, and they never asked their users to pay. Why didn’t they ask us to pay? In 2019, I felt a rising dread as the months ticked by and the app didn’t receive a single update. Sure enough, in the fall, Tapstack announced that it was shutting down. It offered its users a way to export their data. It went gracefully. It was, I have to say, a really great app. Here comes a new challenger My family all agreed we were going to need a replacement, and while my first instinct was to set up a group on Instagram or WhatsApp, the prospect of having our warm channel surrounded — encroached upon — by all that other garbage made me feel even sadder than the prospect of losing Tapstack. So, instead of settling for a corporate messaging app …  I built one just for us. I’ll show you the screen capture again, but the point is that there’s not much to show. The app is a “magic window” that captures photos and videos and shuttles them around. Messages wait in a queue and, once viewed — always full-screen, with no distractions, no prods to comment or share — they disappear. That is literally it. The app has basically no interface. There’s a camera button and a badge in the corner, calm green, that indicates how many messages are waiting. Tap or click to unmute. Here are a few mildly technical observations. Feel free to skip ahead if this part doesn’t interest you: Tapstack was simple to start with, and I made it even simpler. Unlike Tapstack, my app doesn’t need a login system. It doesn’t need an interface to create and manage contacts. It already knows exactly who’s using it. (This makes me think about an old blog post by Clay Shirky: “Situated software, by contrast, doesn’t need to be personalized — it is personal from its inception.”) The core of the app is a camera view with the now-familiar tap/press for photo/video affordance. This is an off-the-rack open source component; what a gift. I don’t think this project would have been possible without it. Besides the app itself, not much is required: an AWS S3 bucket to hold the photos and videos, a couple of AWS Lambda functions to shuffle things around when new messages are uploaded. The back end is actually fairly elegant — which is, uh, not usually my style — but, again, that’s only because it’s so simple. There’s barely anything there. I distribute the app to my family using TestFlight, and in Test­Flight it shall remain forever: a cozy, eternal beta. In a better world, I would have built this in a day, using some kind of modern, flexible HyperCard for iOS. In our actual world, I built it in about a week, and roughly half of that time was spent wrestling with different flavors of code-signing and identity provi­sioning and I don’t even know what. I burned some incense and threw some stones and the gods of Xcode allowed me to pass. Our actual world isn’t totally broken. I do not take for granted, not for one millisecond, the open source compo­nents and sample code that made this project possible. In the 21st century, as long as you’re operating within the bounds of the state of the art, program­ming can feel delight­fully Lego-like. All you have to do is rake your fingers through the bin. I know I ought to pay it forward and publish the code for my app. Even if it doesn’t work for anyone else as-is, it might provide a helpful guide — one I would have been grateful to have. But the code is marbled with application-specific values, well-salted with authen­ti­ca­tion keys. This app is Entirely Itself — not a framework, not a template — and that’s insep­a­rable from the spirit in which it was made. Which brings me to: Cooking at home For a long time, I have struggled to artic­u­late what kind of programmer I am. I’ve been writing code for most of my life; I can make many inter­esting and useful things happen on computers. At the same time, I would not last a day as a profes­sional software engineer. Leave me in charge of a critical database and you will return to a smoldering crater. Building this app, I figured it out: I am the program­ming equiv­a­lent of a home cook. The exhor­ta­tion “learn to code” has its foun­da­tions in market value. “Learn to code” is suggested as a way up, a way out. “Learn to code” offers economic leverage, profes­sional transformation. “Learn to code” goes on your resume. But let’s substi­tute a different phrase: “learn to cook”. People don’t only learn to cook so they can become chefs. Some do! But many more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more affordably. Because they want to carry on a tradition. Sometimes they learn because they’re bored! Or even because they enjoy spending time with the person who’s teaching them. The list of reasons to “learn to cook” overflows, and only a handful have anything to do with the marketplace. Cooking reaches beyond buying and selling to touch nearly all of human experience. It connects to domes­ticity and curiosity; to history and culture; to care and love. Well, it’s the 21st century now, and I suspect that many of the people you love are waiting inside the pocket computer you are never long without, so I will gently suggest that perhaps coding might connect the same way. When you liberate program­ming from the require­ment to be profes­sional and scalable, it becomes a different activity altogether, just as cooking at home is really nothing like cooking in a commer­cial kitchen. I can report to you: not only is this different activity rewarding in almost exactly the same way that cooking for someone you love is rewarding, there’s another feeling, too, specific to this realm. I have struggled to find words for this, but/and I think it might be the crux of the whole thing: This messaging app I built for, and with, my family, it won’t change unless we want it to change. There will be no sudden redesign, no flood of ads, no pivot to chase a userbase inscrutable to us. It might go away at some point, but that will be our decision. What is this feeling? Independence? Security? Sovereignty? Is it simply … the feeling of being home? Update, February 2022: Two years later, my family still uses BoopSnoop every day. I have added one (1) feature, at my mother’s request. Update, February 2023: Yep, still using it every day! February 2020, Oakland",

I have been working on a personal project for the last 10 years that replaces every other app I used to use - E-mail, calendar, and all the others we all use on a daily basis - and every time someone sees me using it they ask \"Wow, this is amazing, how do I download it!?\", and the answer is always the same: you don&#x27;t.There&#x27;s a beauty to engineering something having yourself as the target user, and no one else. I&#x27;m 100% convinced this project single-handedly keep my mental wellbeing in check, and it provides me with a constant source of hopefulness and happiness to the future - that no company&#x2F;salary could ever offer me. My exclusive, differential, unique characteristic against the world, my joker card. reply supertron 21 hours agoparent> There&#x27;s a beauty to engineering something having yourself as the target user, and no one else.100%, I&#x27;m following a similar approach to you with yet another notes app solely for my own use.Have you written more about your personal project anywhere?One thing I only realised once I started building my own tools, is that you become - from day one - an unmatched world-class expert in using that tool. This seems obvious and inconsequential on the face of it, but how many pieces of software do you use where you can say with 100% certainty that you know every single thing about it?Every feature, every shortcut, how it all works internally...It&#x27;s only when you use something self-crafted that you realise what this actually means. If it&#x27;s a tool that you use for work or productivity - you can become exceptionally productive with it due to this from-day-one \"total mastery\".This compounds if you iterate. Using the tool daily and feeding back in little fixes and optimisations as you go. The tool grows with you and molds to your use of it over time.It&#x27;s obvious that the tool is going to be well suited to your needs if you built it - but it was less obvious to me ahead of time what benefits the side effect of \"total mastery\" would also bring.For me, my notes app is now used as my personal knowledge base, project management tool, todo list, daily planning tool and for journalling. Because I built it, I&#x27;m extremely effective at using it - and it&#x27;s lean and fast - only with the features that I know I need.In addition to being a very fulfilling project - it has created a degree of leverage and efficiency that I didn&#x27;t expect!My conclusion is that we should all experiment more with creating our own tools. reply caipira 21 hours agorootparent> Have you written more about your personal project anywhere?No, I&#x27;ve had plans to create a blog to write about it or make a YouTube video, but haven&#x27;t come to it yet.> One thing I only realised once I started building my own tools, is that you become - from day one - an unmatched world-class expert in using that toolThis is something that I&#x27;ve also realized - a lot of times when we interact with software we kinda just fly by its UI to accomplish a goal, not paying much attention to its secondary features, options, quirks, etc - But when you write your own software, you have a map of everything in your head, and you don&#x27;t have to guess what exactly a button does, how it does it or where you need to go to do that. reply srcreigh 9 hours agorootparentHonestly, a stream of thoughts 1.5hr video about it all would be a cool listen. Not that it has to be 1.5hr but I’m sure your unedited thoughts will have some great insights reply calamari4065 19 hours agorootparentprevOne of the worst things in the world is explaining how it works to someone else, then watching them use it poorly.I have a convenience tool I made for myself, but shared with my coworkers. I deeply regret sharing it because nobody knows how to use it effectively reply ozim 10 hours agorootparentWhat is even worse for me - I myself make a tool then stop using it and later I cannot come back.Like with the spreadsheets I did to manage stuff. If I don’t use it at least weekly it quickly becomes less and less useful.But also they mostly served their purpose and it is time to use new one. Not everything has to be used forever. reply rchaud 16 hours agorootparentprevI remember recommending a non-iPod MP3 player that had a ton of customization options directly on the device. I regretted it because the person that bought it expected it to work exactly like an iPod plus the bells and whistles I recommended. reply vineyardmike 7 hours agorootparentprev> For me, my notes app is now used as my personal knowledge base, project management tool, todo list, daily planning tool and for journalling.

Anything you would be willing to share about it?For me, I used a different notes app which I liked, and wanted to learn a new language&#x2F;framework so I wrote a new backend for mine, and it just kinda spiraled.The next thing I wanna do is add a CalDav interface so I can store events in it, and interact with them constantly with everything else I do. reply appplication 18 hours agorootparentprevIf I recall correctly, this approach was what led to Apollo’s success before Reddit murdered it. reply infinitebit 13 hours agorootparentprevI’ve made a poll&#x2F;group decision making app for my family and friends, and i’m this close to starting some sort of collaborative note&#x2F;list making app because apple notes causes us so many headaches reply zzo38computer 5 hours agoparentprevI write programs mainly for myself but also usually (not always) make them available for other people to use too in case they find it useful (or want to modify it, use a part of the code, criticize it, make backup copies, or anything else they might want to do with it). If I am annoyed by something someone else writes about it, I can just ignore it; it doesn&#x27;t affect how I will use it for myself, and other people can still do what they want. (And, if someone does not want to allow others to criticize it and submit patches and bug reports and stuff like that, then you can still make the file available without allowing comments to be written about it, without discussion forums, without issues and pull requests in GitHub or similar, etc.) reply bberenberg 17 hours agoparentprevI wish more people would take stuff like this, oss it, and disable PR requests and issues. Let others use it &#x2F; learn &#x2F; build on it with the clear expectation that feedback and contributions are unwanted. reply lobsterthief 17 hours agorootparentTo be fair, when you do that you would approach coding the application differently, which adds to development time. Also, it can change the whole mentality of developing it. Probably why more people don’t do that, though I agree it would be nice. reply quickthrower2 16 hours agorootparentYou can ossify it (ha!) after you have done all the work and it is mostly complete. git remote add origin … git push reply fuzztester 12 hours agorootparentTime to coin a new word - enossification - like enshittification - which I came across here recently, but without the negative connotation of the latter. reply bberenberg 16 hours agorootparentprevCan you elaborate on what you would need to do different in terms of dev? The only thing I would do differently in this scenario would be to ensure no secrets or anything gets into the code which is a minor lift but also probably for the best. reply eternityforest 40 minutes agorootparentI assume the issue is you self-censor more and have to do things exactly by the book.I&#x27;ve never been particularly interested in \"software for one person\" but I&#x27;ve shared lots of working but not great code(years old from before type annotations that hasn&#x27;t been touched much since, written a hurry, etc), and faced some embarrassment.If I was actually attached to specific details of the style, like \"Yeah it crashes on some JSON input, but I don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s only meant to handle stuff from this other thing I made\" I might not really like sharing it as much. reply rthomas6 16 hours agorootparentprevIn python I do horrible things like the following when nobody else is going to see it: [[[foo(x) for x in y] for y in bar_vec if baz(y)] for bar_vec in bar_mat if bar_vec != []] reply Cyphase 5 hours agorootparentSide note, you don&#x27;t need `if bar_vec != []`. Trying to loop over an empty iterable (e.g. a list) just doesn&#x27;t loop, since there&#x27;s nothing there.Also, another way to write this (which results in a flattened list) is: [foo(x) for bar_vec in bar_mat for y in bar_vec if baz(y) for x in y] reply arolihas 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe I&#x27;m telling on myself but this doesn&#x27;t seem that bad at all. reply __MatrixMan__ 15 hours agorootparentprevI have my secret perversions as well, so I&#x27;ve got no judgement for you, but I do have to wonder how our editing styles differ if you find that easier to navigate than the equivalent nested for loop. reply rthomas6 8 hours agorootparentnext [–]for bar_vec in bar_mat: if bar_vec != []: for y in bar_vec: if baz(y): for x in y: foo(x)Seeing it written out here, the example looks nice. In real code with more complexity, it takes longer for me to write it, and it usually takes up a lot more space than this. It bugs me how much space it takes up for something that is one idea in my head (Foo all the baz things in bar_vec).But if there is anyone coming after me, I would write it in this style for their sake, because this style is easier to change. reply __MatrixMan__ 1 hour agorootparentAt least in my code, these nested loop thingies are rarely unique. If I have to do it once I probably have to do it many times. If I&#x27;m being mindful, I stop repeating myself and just write a generator so that I can invoke it like: [foo(x) for x in nonempty(bar_mat)]Mostly this is because I live in fear of ruff&#x27;s complexity warning, C901. reply Arelius 16 hours agorootparentprevI dunno, that seems to be just shame instilled by the toxicity of certain programmer culture.I mean, it&#x27;s not the clearest thing to read but labeling it horrible seems to be a judgement call that&#x27;s unwarranted. And as software developers, we should create an environment that&#x27;s less hostile to people who write things in ways we wouldn&#x27;t.And honestly, that set of list comprehensions has a bit of a lispy functional vibe, which could quite frankly be applauded in certain contexts. reply nicbou 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is fine. I make all of my stuff open source, but I&#x27;ll be honest with people about being the only user that matters to my development work. reply pech0rin 11 hours agorootparentprevI disagree with this. If you are truly building for yourself there is no criticism, no prying eyes, it is well and truly yours. Even with PR and issues closed people read it, maybe comment about it on social media or hackernews. There is beauty in a creation that is complete private. reply hiq 21 hours agoparentprev> I have been working on a personal project for the last 10 years that replaces every other app I used to use - E-mail, calendar, and all the others we all use on a daily basisWould you be willing to describe how it works &#x2F; record a video of how you use it? But maybe that goes against your last sentence:> My exclusive, differential, unique characteristic against the world, my joker card.?I guess the idea is that you integrated all the apps with each other, such that you can create an event from a text message, forward an email to a Signal contact, this kind of things?I quickly write scripts to automate things I do several times, but I didn&#x27;t go as far as integrating all my scripts into a single one. Having things decoupled reduces the maintenance burden, such that I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to go that way either. reply caipira 20 hours agorootparent> Would you be willing to describe how it works &#x2F; record a video of how you use it?I&#x27;ll definitely do it in the near future and post it here on HN.> My exclusive, differential, unique characteristic against the world, my joker card.In the sense that, if one day money becomes short, I could extract a few SAAS out of it and make some money or even sell it.> I guess the idea is that you integrated all the apps with each other, such that you can create an event from a text message, forward an email to a Signal contact, this kind of things?Yes, the main app has standalone apps, where each app integrates with each other whenever possible, like listing contacts in the email app, and one of the apps is \"Flow\", where you can create IFTTTs between apps. reply helboi4 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love to read a post about this. I started making something similar actually before I got my most recent job. But it was with less pure intentions. I did have various personal requirements that I wanted to see if I could impliment in a singular organisation system, since I am chronically disorganised. However, I started actually doing it just so I could practice my java and have a complicated java project on my github since I was applying for jobs. That&#x27;s really why it&#x27;s died a bit afterwards. reply hiq 13 hours agorootparentprevI assume you choose the services you depend on wisely, to make sure it&#x27;s possible to integrate with them? E.g. thinking of common apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, some email providers: they don&#x27;t necessarily provide an API that you can call into, and sometimes you rely on a library a 3rd-party developed but which breaks regularly.Looking forward to your post on HN! reply kmarc 21 hours agoparentprevSimilarly, albeit with much less effort, I configured (neomutt) into the most beautiful and best, rapid UX mail client ever. I use it at work and for private purposes.People are impressed when looking at it. A handful of them asked for the config. Don&#x27;t think any one ever got used to it. reply hiq 21 hours agorootparentHow did you configure neomutt? I mostly have the default configuration, with some other tweaks I&#x27;ve forgotten about (like changing mailboxes using a function key). What am I missing out? reply behnamoh 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat about SSO? Sadly, none of the terminal-based email clients I tried supported this, but since you said you use this at work, maybe it supports SSO login to your work email? reply rustyminnow 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a bit of a trek to get there, but here&#x27;s how to work around SSO...1. Go to the Microsoft&#x2F;Google developer console with your work account and create an \"internal app\" for personal use 2. Generate a set of oauth2 creds under the app 3. Use a program like mbsync or offlineimap to sync your mail down to a maildir. Iirc mbsync was more reliable but required a shim script to convert oauth2 creds to an api token. 4. Point your email client to the mail-dir.I had this set up when I used gmail at work, but AIUI outlook should work roughly the same.There&#x27;s a ton of blog posts out there of people setting this up, unfortunately too many variations to have \"one true\" guide, so sorta have to pull from several places. reply grinich 16 hours agorootparentprevHow would SSO work for a terminal? What would it do? reply rustyminnow 16 hours agorootparentIn this case it&#x27;s easier to bypass SSO with a set of oauth2 creds, but the aws and azure clis support SSO login by opening a browser to authenticate and generate a short-lived api token that gets passed back to the cli. So it&#x27;s definitely possible for terminal apps to support SSO. reply lambdaba 21 hours agorootparentprevplease share this, I&#x27;d like to check it out reply psalminen 3 hours agoparentprevFor my job, I&#x27;ve created a python ask and CLI that meets the exact needs of how I need to communicate with our API. It&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than any postman collection my employees useThe code is a mess so I haven&#x27;t shared, but it is something that makes me more productive every day. reply robofanatic 21 hours agoparentprevIts like your own self built cottage in the woods. reply rchaud 16 hours agorootparentI like this parallel, it connects to other metaphors like \"digital gardening\", aka cultivating information and cross-pollinating (adding links) to related pages. reply factorialboy 21 hours agoparentprevWould you be open to sharing screenshots? I&#x27;m curious about the mental-sanity claim, do you not have your email + calendar setup on your phone? reply HKH2 21 hours agorootparentNot OP, but how often do you have an app that is exactly how you want it? You might just shrug off the small annoyances, but you could fix them and make the app something that becomes second nature. The UI won&#x27;t suddenly change, so you won&#x27;t have to relearn how to use the app, just like you don&#x27;t have to relearn physical interfaces. reply zzo38computer 5 hours agorootparentIt is only very rarely exactly how I want it. Often, I cannot even find software that is half of how I want it (and is sometimes difficult to change). So, sometimes I will write them by myself to work differently. But, other times another program can be modified as needed, but that is less common, to me. reply ParetoOptimal 20 hours agorootparentprevThe above are all reasons I use emacs. reply dingnuts 12 hours agorootparentfor REAL. when I started using Emacs, everyone told me Emacs was old and I should use Sublime Text II or Atom. Now they all tell me Emacs is old and I should use VS Code. I wonder what they&#x27;ll tell me to use instead of Emacs in ten years :) reply marssaxman 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is (largely) why I do all my coding work in an editor of my own creation. It suits me perfectly, and it never changes unless I want it to. reply david422 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve used some horrendous software in the past and it&#x27;s nice that - even though I can&#x27;t fix that software - I can write my own software and make it behave exactly how I want it to. reply distcs 20 hours agoparentprevTell us more about your project! Did you start it from scratch? Or did you use another opensource app as starting point and developed it further for yourself? What language is your app written in? Where do you run it? In CLI? or desktop GUI? The more you can share about it the merrier. I am sure others want to learn more about this too. reply caipira 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s basically like the Google suite of apps or Next Cloud, I have the main app where you can manage your account, backups, etc, and it links to a bunch of other apps, each one living in a subdomain. The apps that already exists are:- Password manager - Finances - Contacts - Account (Backup, Restore, private keys, etc) - Authenticator (OTP, TOTP) - Email - Photos - Movies (2 parts, one is an IMDB like manager and the other is a Netflix homepage look alike for viewing content) - Flashcards - Link trackerAnd I have the following apps in the development pipeline:- Calendar - Drive - Notes - URL Shortener - RSS Reader - Tasks - Books - Musics & Podcasts - TimelinesIt started just as an MySQL database that I used to track my expenses and budget, later I started also storing passwords in it, quickly I realized that I needed a user interface, then I slapped a bootstrap theme on it (this was back when Angular 1 was all the rage), then it went through many iterations as across the years and the current one started back in 2020, it uses VueJS 3 and used to use ant design, but I had to create my own UI library to accommodate the sheer complexity of the custom UI needed. It runs on a raspberry pi with docker. reply spenczar5 19 hours agorootparent“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.” - Zawinski’s Law:) reply sotix 18 hours agorootparentI like that law! My law for the past few years has been every app expands until it is beyond bloat, which is recognizable when it has the feature du jour, which can be found across every popular and unrelated app. At the time, that feature was stories, which could be found in Snapchat, instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Uber eats, and I think even Venmo at one point.Once you got away from social apps, it was clearly feature creep. That was my indicator for when there was probably a better alternative app for accomplishing the app’s original purpose, but it was often too late to switch due to the network effect. reply nxobject 14 hours agorootparentAnd now it&#x27;s microblogging, sadly (well, it very nearly was a digital wallet.) I think an AI chatbot&#x27;s only a matter of time... reply fuzztester 12 hours agorootparentprevThere ought to be a law (or n ...) about JavaScript frameworks. reply ayewo 3 hours agorootparentIn 2007, Jeff Atwood made the quote that was popularly referred to as Atwood’s Law:[5]“Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.”From: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jeff_Atwood reply fuzztester 2 hours agorootparentHa! Now we need a similar law for Electron, and for Slack, and for LLMs ...Here&#x27;s a stab (pun intended) at one for LLMs:\"Any application that can be written by an LLM, will eventually be written by an LLM.\" replykodablah 17 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately you almost have to do this in secrecy with a homemade scraping app lest its popularity causes the site owner to take action reply Rehanzo 16 hours agoparentprevWhy would you want to combine it all into one app? Having seperate apps for those things (maybe besides having calendar and email together) sounds proper to me. Seems odd to put it all together into one. reply __MatrixMan__ 15 hours agorootparentProper so that people who only want to use part of it don&#x27;t have to use all of it. But if your user base is one person then why not go seamless? If you dislike that part of the app, just delete it. reply whompyjaw 12 hours agoparentprevCurious, how deep does the DIY go?

When looking at the decision tree for even cheaper options, it basically said to find another hobby.Not sure if that&#x27;s changed but ever since seeing that line, I&#x27;ve been put off of that world.

I immediately bowed out, and they immediately let that first-launched beta languish for more than 10 years with less staff than we had.In the intervening years, another startup built a similar competitor and sold for hundreds of millions of dollars.As another example, I eventually worked at Gigantic Inc, and the org that I was part of had been failing to deliver a useful product to the public for about 7 years, and continued to fail for many more. This was an organization with hundreds of people and many hundreds of millions of dollars of budget, and they were being absolutely clobbered by a combination of their own unbelievable incompetence and the brutality of the market around them.One of the biggest lessons I&#x27;ve learned in my career, is to never assume that just because Big Tech has some budget, that they also have attention or competence. reply JohnFen 18 hours agorootparentprev> since they all require massive compute now.They do?

I just launched my first full stack side project (I&#x27;m a mobile dev by day.) I was always technically capable of it...but using LLM&#x27;s I basically was able to skip the \"how do I do X in node\" steps and significantly speed up the backend side of things, while I still learned a ton in the process.Now it feels like I have these incredible capabilities to apply LLMs in novel ways. I&#x27;ve had a personal project (an expense tracking app) where now I can see a path to easily do things like scanning receipts accurately, automatically categorizing CSV imports, etc. They were always within the realm of possibility - but would have taken so much more time to build as a one man shop.

People don’t only learn to cook so they can become chefs. Some do! But many more people learn to cook so they can eat better, or more affordably. Because they want to carry on a tradition. Sometimes they learn because they’re bored! Or even because they enjoy spending time with the person who’s teaching them.This is actually why I think more people should learn some coding (and why there should be more HyperCard-like environments for non-professionals).

    "title": "Repairing Macs On the Go: An Inside Look at Door-to-Door Apple Authorized Service Provider",
    "originLink": "https://matduggan.com/fixing-macs-door-to-door/",
    "originBody": "When I graduated college in 2008, even our commencement speaker talked about how moving back in with your parents is nothing to be ashamed of. I sat there thinking well that certainly can't be a good sign. Since I had no aspirations and my girlfriend was moving to Chicago, I figured why not follow her. I had been there a few times and there were no jobs in Michigan. We found a cheap apartment near her law school and I started job hunting. After a few weeks applying to every job on Craigslist, I landed an odd job working for an Apple Authorized Repair Center. The store was in a strip mall in the suburbs of Chicago with a Dollar Store and a Chinese buffet next door. My primary qualifications were that I was willing to work for not a lot of money and I would buy my own tools. My interview was with a deeply Catholic boss who focused on how I had been an alter boy growing up. Like all of my bosses early on, his primary quality was he was a bad judge of character. I was hired to do something that I haven't seen anyone else talk about on the Internet and wanted to record before it was lost to time. It was a weird program, a throwback to the pre-Apple Store days of Apple Mac support that was called AppleCare Dispatch. It still appears to exist (https://www.apple.com/support/products/mac/) but I don't know of any AASPs still dispatching employees. It's possible that Apple has subcontracted it out to someone else. AppleCare Dispatch Basically if you owned a desktop Mac and lived in certain geographic areas, when you contacted AppleCare to get warranty support they could send someone like me out with a part. Normally they'd do this only for customers who were extremely upset or had a store repair go poorly. I'd get a notice that AppleCare was dispatching a part, we'd get it from FedEx and then I'd fill a backpack full of tools and head out to you on foot. While we had the same certifications as an Apple Genius, unlike the Genius Bar we weren't trained on any sort of \"customer service\" element. All we did was Mac hardware repairs all day, with pretty tight expectations of turnaround. So how it worked at the time was basically if the Apple Store was underwater with in-house repairs, or you asked for at-home or the customer was Very Important, we would get sent out. I would head out to you on foot with my CTA card. That's correct, I didn't own a car. AppleCare didn't pay a lot for each dispatch and my salary of $25,000 a year plus some for each repair didn't go far in Chicago even in the Great Recession. So this job involved me basically taking every form of public transportation in Chicago to every corner of the city. I'd show up at your door within a 2 hour time window, take your desktop Mac apart in your house, swap the part, run the diagnostic and then take the old part with me and mail it back to Apple. Apple provided a backend web panel which came with a chat client. Your personal Apple ID was linked with the web tool (I think it was called ASX) where you could order parts for repairs as well as open up a chat with the Apple rep there to escalate an issue or ask for additional assistance. The system worked pretty well, with Apple paying reduced rates for each additional part after the first part you ordered. This encouraged us all to get pretty good at specific diagnostics with a minimal number of swaps. Our relationship to Apple was bizarre. Very few people at Apple even knew the program existed, seemingly only senior AppleCare support people. We could get audited for repair quality, but I don't remember that ever happening. Customer satisfaction was extremely important and basically determined the rate we got paid, so we were almost never late to appointments and typically tried to make the experience as nice as possible. Even Apple Store staff seemed baffled by us on the rare occasions we ran into each other. There weren't a lot of us working in Chicago around 2008-2010, maybe 20 in total. The community was small and I quickly met most of my peers who worked at other independent retail shops. If our customer satisfaction numbers were high, Apple never really bothered us. They'd provide all the internal PDF repair guides, internal diagnostic tools and that was it. It is still surprising that Apple turned us loose onto strangers without anyone from Apple speaking to us or making us watch a video. Our exam was mostly about not ordering too many parts and ensuring we could read the PDF guide of how to fix a Mac. A lot of the program was a clear holdover from the pre-iPod Apple, where resources were scarce and oversight minimal. As Apple Retail grew, the relationship to Apple Authorized Service Providers got more adversarial and controlling. But that's a story for another time. Tools etc For the first two years I used a Manhattan Portage bag, which looked nice but was honestly a mistake. My shoulder ended up pretty hurt after carrying a heavy messenger bag for 6+ hours a day. The only screwdrivers I bothered with was Wiha precision screwdrivers. I tried all of them and Wiha were consistently the best by a mile. Wiha has a list of screwdrivers by Apple model available here: https://www.wihatools.com/blogs/articles/apple-and-wiha-tools Macs of this period booted off of FireWire, so that's what I had with me. FireWire 800 LaCie drives were the standard issue drives in the field. You'd partition it to have a series of OS X Installers on there (so you could restore the customer back to what they had before) along with a few bootable installs of OS X. These were where you'd run your diagnostic software. The most commonly used ones were as follows: DaisyDisk, the most popular disk space analyzer Get a visual breakdown of your disk space in form of an interactive map, reveal the biggest space wasters, and remove them with a simple drag and drop.

Crazy times 9/11 Truther One of my first calls was for a Mac Pro at a private residence. It was a logic board, which means the motherboard of the Mac. I wasn't thrilled, because removing and replacing the Mac Pro logic board was a time-consuming repair that required a lot of light. Instead of a clean workspace with bright lights I got a guy who would not let me go until I had watched how 9/11 was an inside job. The logic board in question \"Look, you don't really think the towers were blown up by planes do you?\" he said as he dug around this giant stack of papers to find...presumably some sort of Apple-related document. I had told him that I had everything I needed, but that I had a tight deadline and needed to start right now. \"Sure, but I'll put the video on in the background and you can just listen to it while you work.\" So while I took a Mac Pro down to the studs and rebuilt it, this poorly narrated video explained how it was the CIA behind 9/11. His office or, \"command center\", looked like a set of the X-Files. There were folders and scraps of paper everywhere along with photos of buildings, planes, random men wearing sunglasses. I think it was supposed to come across as if he was doing an investigation, but it reminded me more of a neighbor who struggled with hoarding. If there was an organizational system, I couldn't figure it out. Why was this person so willing to dedicate an large portion of their house to \"solving a mystery\" the rest of us had long since moved on from? The Mac Pro answered all my questions when it booted up. The desktop was full of videos he had edited of 9/11 truth material along with website assets for where he sold these videos. This guy wasn't just a believer, he produced the stuff. When I finished, we had to run a diagnostic test to basically confirm the thing still worked as well as move the serial number onto the logic board. When it cleared diagnostic I took off, thanking him for his time and wishing him a nice day. He looked devastated and asked if I wanted to go grab a drink at the bar and continue our conversation. I declined, jogging to the L. The Doctors One of the rich folks I was sent out to lived in one of those short, super expensive buildings on Lake Shore Drive. For those unfamiliar, these shorter buildings facing the water in Chicago are often divided into a few large houses. Basically you pass through an army of doorman, get shown into an elevator that opens into the persons house. That was, if you could get through the doormen. The staff in rich peoples houses want to immediately establish with any contractor coming into the home that they're superior to you. This happened to me constantly, from personal assistants to doormen, maids, nannies, etc. Doormen in particular liked to make a big deal of demonstrating that they could stop me from going up. This one stuck out because he made me take the freight elevator, letting me know \"the main elevator is for people who live here and people who work here\". I muttered about how I was also working there and he rolled his eyes and called me an asshole. On another visit to a different building I had a doorman physically threaten \"to throw me down\" if I tried to get on the elevator. The reason was all contractors had to have insurance registered with the building before they did work there, even though I wasn't.....removing wires from the wall. The owner came down and explained that I wasn't going to do any work, I was just \"a friend visiting\". I felt bad for the doorman in that moment, in a dumb hat and ill-fitting jacket with his brittle authority shattered. So I took the freight elevator up, getting let into what I would come to see as \"the rich persons template home\". My time going into rich peoples houses were always disappointing, as they are often a collection of nice items sort of strewn around. I was shown by the husband into the library, a beautiful room full of books with what I (assumed) were prints of paintings in nice frames leaning against the bookshelves. There was an iMac with a dead hard drive, which is an easy repair. The process for fixing a hard drive was \"boot to DiskWarrior, attempt to fix disk, have it fail, swap the drive\". Even if DiskWarrior fixed the Mac and it booted, I would still swap the drive (why not and it's what I was paid to do) but then I didn't have to have the talk. This is where I would need to basically sit someone down and tell them their data was gone. \"What about my taxes?!?\" I would shake my head sadly. Thankfully this time the drive was still functional so I could copy the data over with a SATA to USB adapter. As I reinstalled OS X, I walked around the room and looked at the books. I realized they were old, really old and the paintings on the floor were not prints. There were sketches by Picasso, other names I had heard in passing through going through art museums. When he came back in, I asked why there was a lot of art. \"Oh sure, my dads, his big collection, I'm going to hang it up once we get settled.\" He, like his wife, didn't really acknowledge my presence unless I directed a question right at him. I started to google some of the books, my eyes getting wide. There was millions of dollars in this room gathering dust. He never made eye contact with me during this period and quickly left the room. This seems strange but was really common among these clients. I truly think for many of the C-level type people whose house I went to, they didn't really even see me. I had people turn the lights off in rooms I was in, forget I was there and leave (while arming the security system). For whatever reason I instantly became part of the furniture. When I went to the kitchen for a drink of water, the maid let me know that they have lived there for coming up on 5 years. This was surprising to me because the apartment looked like they had moved in two weeks ago. There were still boxes on the floor, a tv sitting on the windowsill and what I would come to understand was a \"prop fridge\". It had bottled water, a single bottle of expensive champagne, juices, fruit and often some sort of energy drink. No leftovers, everything gets swapped out before it goes bad and gets replaced. \"They're always at work\" she explained, grabbing her bag and offering to let me out before she locked up. They were both specialist doctors and this was apparently where they recharged their batteries. After the first AppleCare Dispatch visit they would call me back for years to fix random problems. I don't think either of them ever learned my name. HARPO Studio I was once called to fix a \"high profile\" computer at HARPO studios in Chicago. This was where they filmed the Oprah Winfrey Show, which I obviously knew of the existence of but had never watched. Often these celebrity calls went to me, likely because I didn't care and didn't particularly want them. I was directed to park across the street and told even though the signs said \"no parking\" that they had a \"deal with the city\". This repair was suspicious and I got the sense that someone had name dropped Oprah to maybe get it done. AppleCare rarely sent me multiple parts unless the case was unusual or the person had gotten escalated through the system. If you emailed Steve Jobs back in the day and his staff approved a repair, it attached a special code to the serial number that allowed us to order effectively unlimited items against the serial number. However with the rare \"celebrity\" case, we would often find AppleCare did the same thing, throwing parts at us to make the problem go away. The back area of HARPO was busy, with what seemed like an almost exclusively female staff. \"Look it's important that if you see Oprah, you act normally, please don't ask her for an autograph or a photo\". I nodded, only somewhat paying attention because never in a million years would I do that. This office felt like the set of The West Wing, with people constantly walking and talking along with a lot of hand motions. My guide led me to a back office with a desk on one side and a long table full of papers and folders. The woman told me to \"fix the iMac\" and left the room. Not the exact office but you get the jist I swapped the iMac hard drive and screen, along with the memory and wifi then dived under the desk the second Oprah walked in. The woman and Oprah had a conversation about scheduling someone at a farm, or how shooting at a farm was going and then she was gone. When I popped my head up, the woman looked at me and was like \"can you believe you got to meet Oprah?\" She had a big smile, like she had given me the chance of a lifetime. The bummer about the aluminum iMac repairs is you have to take the entire screen off to get anything done. This meant I couldn't just run away and hide my shame after effectively diving under a table to escape Oprah, a woman who I am certain couldn't have cared less what came out of my mouth. I could have said \"I love to eat cheese sometimes\" and she would have nodded and left the room. So you have to pop the glass off (with suction cups, not your hands like a psycho as shown above), then unscrew and remove the LCD and then finally you get access to the actual components. Any dust that got on the LCD would stick and annoy people, so you had to try and keep it as clean as possible while moving quickly to get the swap done. The nightmare was breaking the thick cables that connected the screen to the logic board, something I did once and required a late night trip to an electronics repair guy who got me sorted out with a soldering iron. The back alley electronics repair guy is the dark secret of the Dispatch world. If you messed up a part, pulled a cable or broke a connector, Apple could ask you to pay for that part. The Apple list price for parts were hilariously overpriced. Logic boards were like $700-$900, each stick of RAM was like $90 for ones you could buy on crucial for $25. This could destroy your pay for that month, so you'd end up going to Al, who ran basically a \"solder Apple stuff back together\" business in his garage. He wore overalls and talked a lot about old airplanes, which you'd need to endure in order to get the part fixed. Then I'd try to get the part swapped and just pray that the thing would turn on long enough for you to get off the property. Ironically his parts often lasted longer than the official Apple refurbished parts. After I hid under the desk deliberately, I lied for years afterwards, telling people I didn't have time to say hi. In reality my mind completely blanked when she walked in. I stayed under the desk because I was nervous that everyone was going to look at me to be like \"I loved when you did X\" and my brain couldn't form a single memory of anything Oprah had ever done. I remembered Tom Cruise jumping on a couch but I couldn't recall if this was a good thing or a bad thing when it happened. Oh and the car that I parked in the area the city didn't enforce? It had a parking ticket, which was great because I had borrowed the car. Most of the payment from my brush with celebrity went to the ticket and a tank of gas. Brownstone Moms One of the most common calls I got was to rich peoples houses in Lincoln Park, Streeterville, Old Town and a few other wealthy neighborhoods. They often live in distinct brownstone houses with small yards with a \"public\" entrance in the front, a family entrance on the side and then a staff entrance through the back or in the basement. These houses were owned by some of the richest people in Chicago. The houses themselves were beautiful, but they don't operate like normal houses. Mostly they were run by the wives, who often had their own personal assistants. It was an endless sea of contractors coming in and out, coordinated by the mom and sometimes the nanny. Once I was there, they'd pay me to do whatever random technical tasks existed outside of the initial repair. I typically didn't mind since I was pretty fast at the initial repair and the other stuff was easy, mostly setting up printers or routers. The sense I got was if the household made the AppleCare folks life a living hell, I would get sent out to make the problem disappear. These people often had extremely high expectations of customer service, which could be difficult at times. There was a whole ecosystem of these small companies I started to run into more and more. They seemed to specialize in catering to rich people, providing tutoring services, in-house chefs, drivers, security and every other service under the sun. One of the AV installation companies and I worked together off the books after-hours to set up Apple TVs and Mac Minis as the digital media hubs in a lot of these houses. They'd pay me to set up 200 iPods as party favors or wire an iPad into every room. Often I'd show up only to tell them their hard drive was dead and everything was gone. This was just how things worked before iCloud Photos, nobody kept backups and everything was constantly lost forever. Here they would often threaten or plead with me, sometimes insinuating they \"knew people\" at Apple or could get me fired. Jokes on you people, I don't even know people at Apple was often what ran through my head. Threats quickly lost their power when you realized nobody at any point had asked your name or any information about yourself. It's hard to threaten an anonymous person. The golden rule that every single one of these assistants warned me about was not to bother the husband when he gets home. Typically these CEO-types would come in, say a few words to their kids and then retreat to their own area of the house. These were often TV rooms or home theaters, elaborate set pieces with $100,000+ of AV equipment in there that was treated like it was a secret lair of the house. To be clear, none of these men ever cared at all that I was there. They didn't seem to care that anybody was there, often barely acknowledging their wives even though an immense amount of work had gone into preparing for his return. As smartphones became more of a thing, the number of \"please spy on my teen\" requests exploded. These varied from installing basically spyware on their kids laptops to attempting to install early MDM software on the kids iPhones. I was always uncomfortable with these jobs, in large part because the teens were extremely mean to me. One girl waited until her mom left the room to casually turn to me and say \"I will pay you $500 to lie to my mom and say you set this up\". I was offended that this 15 year old thought she could buy me, in large part because she was correct. I took the $500 and told the mom the tracking software was all set up. She nodded and told me she would check that it was working and \"call me back if it wasn't\". I knew she was never going to check, so that part didn't spook me. I just hoped the kid didn't get kidnapped or something and I would end up on the evening news. But I was also a little short that month for rent so what can you do. Tip for anyone reading this looking to get into this rich person Mac business So the short answer is Time Machine is how you get paid month after month. Nobody checks Time Machine or pays attention to the \"days since\" notification. I wrote an AppleScript back in the day to alert you to Time Machine failures through email, but there is an app now that does the same thing: https://tmnotifier.com/ Basically when the backups fail, you schedule a visit and fix the problem. When they start to run out of space, you buy a new bigger drive. Then you backup the Time Machine to some sort of encrypted external location so when the drive (inevitably) gets stolen you can restore the files. The reason they keep paying you is you'll get a call at some point to come to the house at a weird hour and recover a PDF or a school assignment. That one call is how you get permanent standing appointments. Nobody will ever ask you how it works, so just find the system you like best and do that. I preferred local Time Machine over something like remote backup only because you'll be sitting there until the entire restore is done and nothing beats local. Executives will often fill the \"family computer\" with secret corporate documents they needed printed off, so be careful with these backups. Encrypt, encrypt, encrypt then encrypt again. Don't bother explaining how the encryption works, just design the system with the assumption that someone will at some point put a CSV with your social security number onto this fun family iMac covered in dinosaur stickers. Robbed for Broken Parts A common customer for repairs would be schools, who would work with Apple to open a case for 100 laptops or 20 iMacs at a time. I liked these \"mass repair\" days, typically because the IT department for Chicago Public Schools would set us up with a nice clean area to work and I could just listen to a podcast and swap hard drives or replace top cases. However this mass repair was in one of Chicago's rougher neighborhoods. Personal safety was a common topic among the dispatch folks when we would get together for a pizza and a beer. Everyone had bizarre stories but I was the only one not working out of my car. The general sense among the community was it was not an \"if\" but a \"when\" until you were robbed. Typically my rule was if I started to get nervous I'd \"call back to the office\" to check if a part had arrived. Often this would calm people down, reminding them that people knew where I was. Everyone had a story of getting followed back to their car and I had been followed back to the train once or twice. On this trip though everything went wrong that could go wrong. My phone, the HTC Dream running v1 of Android had decided to effectively \"stop phoning\". It was still on but decided we were not, in fact, in the middle of a large city. I was instead in a remote forest miles away from a cell tower. I got to the school later than I wanted to be there, showing up at noon. When I tried to push it and come back the next day the staff let me know the janitors knew I would be there and would let me out. So after replacing a ton of various Mac parts I walked out with boxes of broken parts in my bag and a bunch in an iMac box that someone had given me. My plan was I would head back home, get them checked in and labeled and then drop them off at a FedEx store. When I got out and realized it was dark, I started to accept something bad was likely about to happen to me. Live in a city for any amount of time and you'll start to develop a subconscious odds calculator. The closing line on this wasn't looking great. Sure enough while waiting for the bus, I was approached by a man who made it clear he wanted the boxes. He didn't have a weapon but started to go on about \"kicking the shit\" out of me and I figured that was good enough for me. He clearly thought there was an iMac in the box and I didn't want to be here when he realized that wasn't true. I handed over my big pile of broken parts and sprinted to the bus that was just pulling up, begging the driver to keep driving. As a CTA bus driver, he had of course witnessed every possible horror a human can inflict on another human and was entirely unphased by my outburst. \"Sit down or get off the bus\". When I got home I opened a chat with as Apple rep who seemed unsure of what to do. I asked if they wanted me to go to the police and the rep said if I wanted to I could, but after \"talking to some people on this side\" they would just mark the parts as lost in transit and it wouldn't knock my metrics. I thanked them and didn't think much more of the incident until weeks later when someone from Apple mailed me a small Apple notebook. They never directly addressed the incident (truly the notebook might be unrelated) but I always thought the timing was funny. Get robbed, get a notebook. I still have the notebook.

I ran her out of the apartment, then I remembered it was still plugged in, so I had to stagger totally blind through the apartment to find the damned thing and unplug it lolThat job put me in contact with a criminal gang who went on to supply with me dozens of GBs of stolen hard drives that I used to create what was probably the largest warez FTP in the world and a dump site for most of the top pirate groups like Razor 1911. reply supriyo-biswas 21 minutes agoparent> That job put me in contact with a criminal gang who went on to supply with me dozens of GBs of stolen hard drives that I used to create what was probably the largest warez FTPStatements like this seem to agree with the anti-piracy groups&#x27; narrative about piracy being closely related to organized crime, a claim that initially seemed questionable to me. reply KennyBlanken 40 minutes agoparentprevJust a PSA (not trying to harp on parent commenter, just taking their comment as an opportunity to soapbox) but never, ever, every go into a room or building that is getting smokey from something burning. It&#x27;s how you N+1 the casualty&#x2F;death count in a fire. Unlike the heroes in films and movies, you don&#x27;t have Plot Armor.It is incredibly common that people think they can just go back in holding their breath or stay low or cover their mouth with their clothing like in hollywood...but they take a bit of a breath, cough, and suck in lungfuls of the smoke, and are almost immediately incapacitated.A lot of things, like PVC for example, release chlorine gas when they burn, which immediately turns your lung mucus into hydrochloric acid. All the other things in the smoke is incredibly bad for you both short and long-term, too.The smoke is also flammable. Opening a door lets in oxygen, and oxygen + fuel + heat = a fuckton of heat, very suddenly.I really wish that writers would suffer legal liability for shit like showing people entering a building with their shirt over their mouth - it&#x27;s where people get the idea that they can so that sort of stuff. reply quickthrower2 2 hours agoparentprevWild read! reply muppetman 8 hours agoprevI love this.

Many of them have lived thorough some interesting part of history and witnessed social and cultural, technical, change that will be very interesting in the future.

Way back in like 2004-2006 or so I was working a computer repair desk at a big retailer and did a ton of side business. The side business honestly paid more than my job did.I would travel around NYC fixing things for mostly clueless people. People attempting to screw me on payment was common. The frequent move was to offer drugs or sex in lieu of payment after the work was done. The only sane response to this though was to tell them to just pay what they could afford and then get out of there as fast as possible.I had a few rich and famous clients. It was a fun time, but I got tired of taking long, extended train rides after a full day of work only to do more work and have a long train ride home. reply wkat4242 41 minutes agoparentI did that too, worked for a computer shop and often got hired by clients.Never got offered sex on lieu of payment unfortunately, I would have taken it :) Nor drugs but I don&#x27;t do those. reply KennyBlanken 35 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s almost never the attractive, talented, or regularly-tested-for-STIs-and-STI-free ones that offer the sex... reply 2143 3 hours agoprevThe experiences of people who meet a wide range of customers are always interesting.I had read a similar story of a man who worked at car showrooms of various brands (such as Honda, Toyota).> Look it&#x27;s important that if you see Oprah, you act normally, please don&#x27;t ask her for an autograph or a photoI never understood why people drool when they see celebrities.Movie actors, musicians, sportspersons etc — I like watching them when they&#x27;re in a movie, or when have sung a song, or when they&#x27;re on the field playing, but I never really had any inclination to actually meet them.

By far the sweatiest walk home I’ve ever had was the 20 minute walk carrying home my 5K iMac through the outskirts of a less than fancy neighborhood.

But in many cases, if I shifted my path a half mile in a different direction, it’d be a different story.Like anywhere, I would suppose, being aware of your surroundings, keeping your wits and not making yourself into an easy target will go a very long way to keeping you safe. reply NoZebra120vClip 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m quite unafraid to roam around my own neighborhood, even though it&#x27;s quite rough, because it&#x27;s densely populated, and so there are plenty of other locals passing by at any given time. The scary thing about nighttime in a big urban area, is when you&#x27;re in a strange neighborhood and you&#x27;re not known as a local, and you don&#x27;t know the gang scene there, or ethnic culture is different or whatever. So yeah, carrying around a conspicuously expensive box of electronics will get you noticed in those situations.I&#x27;m fairly standoffish and I&#x27;m wise to a lot of the soft street scams that individuals tend to use. So I&#x27;m not likely to attract someone who will bully or mug me or rough me up. I&#x27;ve literally never had it happen to me.One time I did make a lot of friends on the bus ride home, when I&#x27;d been to Fry&#x27;s Electronics to purchase a large and ostentatious Corsair computer enclosure. It was literally nothing else but the enclosure, so no appreciable electronics, but there was no bag large enough to conceal it, and so the other passengers sat up and took notice of that. Of course, that was in daytime, going through some relatively calm neighborhoods.I&#x27;m usually found on the way to or from a train station around here; train stations are fairly well-regarded as patrolled and safer than the surrounding environs, so it&#x27;s sort of like getting home free when I end up there. reply wutangisforever 7 hours agoprevIt was enlightening to learn about obscure parts of the Mac repair world and to ponder the lives of all the people you met.Awesome article reply jacamera 4 hours agoprevGreat story!

Boeing wants FAA to exempt MAX 7 from safety rules to get it in the airJan. 5, 2024 at 6:00 amUpdated Jan. 5, 2024 at 6:00 am By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporterLittle noticed, the Federal Aviation Administration in December published a Boeing request for an exemption from key safety standards on the 737 MAX 7 — the still-uncertified smallest member of Boeing&#8217;s newest jet family. Since August, earlier models of the MAX currently flying passengers in the U.S. have had to limit use of the jet&#8217;s engine anti-ice system after Boeing discovered a defect in the system with potentially catastrophic consequences.The flaw could cause the inlet at the front end of the pod surrounding the engine — known as a nacelle — to break and fall off.In an August Airworthiness Directive, the FAA stated that debris from such a breakup could penetrate the fuselage, putting passengers seated at windows behind the wings in danger, and could damage the wing or tail of the plane, &#8220;which could result in loss of control of the airplane.&#8221;Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots, said the flaw in the engine anti-ice system has &#8220;given us great concern.&#8221; He said the pilot procedure the FAA approved as an interim solution — urging pilots to make sure to turn off the system when icing conditions dissipate to avoid overheating that within five minutes could seriously damage the structure of the nacelle — is inadequate given the serious potential danger. Advertising &#8220;You get our attention when you say people might get killed,&#8221; Tajer said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not interested in seeing exemptions and accommodations that depend on human memory. … There&#8217;s just got to be a better way.&#8221;In its petition to the FAA, Boeing argues the breakup of the engine nacelle is &#8220;extremely improbable&#8221; and that an exemption will not reduce safety.&#8220;The 737 MAX has been in service since 2017 and has accumulated over 6.5 million flight hours. In that time, there have been no reported cases of parts departing aircraft due to overheating of the engine nacelle inlet structure,&#8221; the filing states.On Thursday, Boeing said in an emailed statement that it is &#8220;developing a long-term solution that will undergo thorough testing and FAA review before being introduced to the 737 MAX fleet.”In the meantime, Boeing said &#8220;inspections are ongoing&#8221; to check for any damage to the nacelles on MAXs in service.However, without an exemption from current safety regulations, the FAA cannot approve the final two MAX models, the MAX 7 and MAX 10, to fly passengers. Advertising On Christmas Eve, just before the deadline for public input on the proposed MAX 7 exemption, the Foundation for Aviation Safety — a lobbying group set up by former Boeing manager and whistleblower Ed Pierson following the two deadly MAX crashes — filed a submission calling on the FAA not to certify the airplane until Boeing fixes the safety defect. &#8220;The Foundation is alarmed at the FAA safety culture, allowing consideration of an exemption proposal … for certification of a new airplane model with a known catastrophic failure (risk) resulting from a simple mistake by the flight crew,&#8221; the Foundation&#8217;s submission states.Warning: Don&#8217;t forget to turn it offIndustry analysts and Boeing investors have long anticipated MAX 7 certification being granted soon. The company&#8217;s share price rose significantly toward year-end based partly on that expectation.If the exemption is granted, certification can go ahead, allowing the MAX 7 to begin flying with Southwest Airlines. Boeing would have until mid-2026 to design, test and certify a permanent fix for the engine anti-ice system defect that would then be retrofitted to all MAXs. By then, there could be nearly 2,000 MAXs in service, meaning more than 4,000 engines needing the retrofit. Advertising Until then, pilots would have to adhere to the limitation currently applied on the MAX 8 and MAX 9 models. After emerging from icy conditions into drier air they have to make sure they turn off the engine anti-ice system, which heats the inner barrel of the engine pod so that ice doesn&#8217;t build up.If they fail to do so, the system can quickly overheat the carbon composite material and damage the structural integrity of the engine pod. The problem is there&#8217;s no alert or indication to the crew that the system needs to be turned off. They just have to remember to do it.Most Read Business Stories Boeing wants FAA to exempt MAX 7 from safety rules to get it in the airAlaska Airlines grounds 737-9 aircraft after midair window blowout on flight from Portland, OregonSeattle-area housing market ends 2023 on a sleepy noteHow to claim a share of Verizon’s $100 million proposed settlementMajor French retailer drops PepsiCo products over high prices If they forget, or are distracted by other tasks, the overheating can begin to damage the structure after just five minutes.Tajer said it&#8217;s &#8220;not uncommon&#8221; for pilots on other aircraft to inadvertently leave the anti-ice system on when it is no longer needed. On older 737s, for example, this would waste energy but not do any damage. The defect affects only the MAX, with engine inlets made from carbon composite rather than the metal used on older models.Sponsored Independent aviation safety consultant and pilot John Cox said he&#8217;s run the anti-ice system on the previous 737 &#8220;for long periods of time.&#8221;And he&#8217;s unsure how practical it is to ask a MAX flight crew to limit the time the system operates in dry air.&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in and out of cloud tops,&#8221; Cox said. &#8220;Do you turn it on, turn it off, turn it on, turn it off?&#8221;&#8220;If you are doing that and get distracted, and end up with the anti-ice off and you go back into clouds where you pick up inlet icing, the next time you turn it on, you&#8217;re going to ingest that ice,&#8221; he added.After reviewing Boeing&#8217;s petition, Cox said he&#8217;d recommend the FAA turn it down.&#8220;With the possibility of such a failure and an Airworthiness Directive with significant limitation already in place, my vote would be to deny the exemption request,&#8221; Cox said. &#8220;Yes, it would affect entry into service, but it could create an &#8216;unsafe condition&#8217; by the FAA’s own words.&#8221; Advertising Michael Stumo, father of Samya Rose Stumo, who died in the second MAX crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet in 2019, said “Boeing claims to have learned its lessons with a new focus upon safety. That is not true.&#8221; &#8220;Boeing is still avoiding safety rules rather than building safe aircraft,” Stumo said.A single point of failure?Boeing&#8217;s petition states that the potential breakup of the engine pod was discovered through analysis and flight testing and could happen only in the case of &#8220;multiple, independent system failures during specific operational and environmental conditions.&#8221;&#8220;Boeing’s quantitative risk assessment evaluated this scenario to be extremely improbable,&#8221; the filing concludes.But Joe Jacobsen, a retired FAA safety engineer and adviser to the Foundation for Aviation Safety, says the petition offers no evidence that this is not a single point of failure.&#8220;A pilot forgetting to turn it off, that&#8217;s all it takes,&#8221; said Jacobsen. Advertising Mike Dostert, another retired FAA safety engineer and also an adviser to the foundation, concurs. &#8220;All it takes is for the system to be left on and you damage the structure,&#8221; said Dostert. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see the multiple failures.&#8221;Without any kind of crew alert to tell the pilots they should shut off the system, he said &#8220;there&#8217;s a pretty good chance human error is going to occur.&#8221;Notably, among the various regulations Boeing wants exempted from is one requiring the jetmaker to prove that any &#8220;single failure or malfunction or probable combination of failures (that) will jeopardize the safe operation of the airplane … is extremely remote.&#8221;Dostert added that this defect could overheat and damage both engines on the plane simultaneously, making such an event potentially even worse than several serious accidents in recent years when broken engine fan blades caused the inlet cowl to break off a single engine.In 2018, a passenger aboard a Southwest Airlines 737 died when a broken fan blade destroyed an engine cowl. Shrapnel penetrated the aircraft’s fuselage and broke a cabin window beside the passenger. Advertising The pod around the engine is part of the airframe and is the responsibility of Boeing, not the engine maker.Dostert said an earlier nonfatal engine blowout on a Southwest flight in 2016 had also led to the inlet cowl departing the aircraft but no fix was made before the fatality in 2018.Almost six years later, the fix for that broken fan blade scenario in older 737s is still in the works. In December, the FAA published a proposal that gives Boeing until the middle of 2028 to develop a retrofit that will strengthen the inlet cowls and fan casings.&#8220;There&#8217;s a pattern here,&#8221; Dostert said. &#8220;Of Boeing knowing about potentially catastrophic single failures, and not addressing them in an expeditious manner.&#8221;Equivalent safety to the MAX 8 and MAX 9In 2022, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun threatened to cancel the MAX 10 if Congress didn&#8217;t amend a law granting permission to certify the jet without meeting the safety regulation for crew alerting systems included in the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act.Congress bowed to the pressure and amended the law, amounting to a safety exemption for the MAX 7 and MAX 10 models. Advertising Boeing argues in its December petition that granting the new exemption, with the same procedural limitation on how the pilots use the engine anti-ice system that applies to the MAX 8 and MAX 9, will leave the MAX 7 no less safe than those two aircraft that are flying passengers every day.But Cox said &#8220;there&#8217;s a difference in an unsafe condition found on the existing fleet and an unsafe condition prior to certification.&#8221;He said he&#8217;s uncomfortable with the idea of &#8220;certifying an airplane with an acknowledged potential unsafe condition.&#8221;With the MAX 8 and 9 already flying, Cox said the FAA&#8217;s only alternative to imposing the operational restriction on those jets was to ground the fleet.&#8220;Do I think it&#8217;s worth grounding the fleet? No, I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a bit of a tough call,&#8221; Cox said. Limiting use of the anti-ice system in dry air is &#8220;probably the best compromise that the FAA and Boeing could come up with and agree on.&#8221;But for Boeing&#8217;s two still-to-be certified airplanes, the MAX 7 and MAX 10, he thinks an expedited permanent fix is a better approach. Advertising &#8220;They need to make it a very strong priority to minimize the time under which the engine is operating with this potential problem and to restore the anti-ice system to normal,&#8221; Cox said.The FAA said in an emailed statement that it will investigate how the defect was missed during the MAX&#8217;s original development and certification and &#8220;will issue a corrective action to ensure Boeing’s future certification programs … are improved.&#8221;The safety agency said it will rule on Boeing&#8217;s petition, but &#8220;there is no specific timetable.&#8221; Dominic Gates:206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com; on Twitter: @dominicgates.

They&#x27;re a god-awful example actually, being heavily chained to nations and in many cases directly supported, protected, and owned by them. There&#x27;s a reason you&#x27;ll see diplomats at airshows. Airline manufacturers are essentially immune to free-market forces, because their respective governments will never let them fail. Not to mention that - unlike aviation - many other industries don&#x27;t even have their own dedicated government agencies to regulate them.Also the airline industry as a whole also has a stellar safety record, Boeing&#x27;s issues notwithstanding.That&#x27;s not to say that your core thesis is necessarily wrong, but airline manufacturers aren&#x27;t a great vehicle to argue that point. reply musha68k 18 minutes agoparentprevWhat would it need so the US government takes over the company and puts the engineers in charge?

That means that while short term earnings are important, so are earnings in the moderately distant future. (depending on risk free interest rates)If a company like Boeing were properly managed, they&#x27;d give suitable priority to engineering excellence, at least to the point of not having critical failures like these, because that&#x27;s core to their ability to compete with Airbus&#x2F;etc in the future.The real issue you&#x27;re concerned about is that it is very difficult to align the interests of corporate managers with the interests of the company. It is relatively easy to align senior management with short term stock prices, but it is difficult for the public to figure out that the gains they see (less engineering cost, faster turnaround time, etc) come at the expense of the longer term viability of the company, so the former gets priced into the short term stock price (and so executive compensation) and the latter does not. reply pella 1 hour agorootparentprev> it is an MBA culture.The MBA program should include more ethics courses and perhaps an adapted version of the Hippocratic Oath.--> MBA Oath : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mbaoath.org&#x2F; reply janice1999 10 hours agorootparentprevAgreed.

They introduced MCAS to compensate for the fact that they didn&#x27;t want to spend on redesigning an aerodynamically stable plane that could accommodate the new, larger engines.When MCAS led to crashes, they dialled it back, increasing the power of the pilot relative to the computer. That&#x27;s not a solve. In either case, the aircraft has an additional point of failure that properly designed aeroplanes do not have.The 788 is great but the 787 MAX, not so much.Needless to say this new story does not inspire further confidence. reply teeray 15 hours agoprevI feel like if you made a plane that has killed anyone recently through your fault, your company should enter a period of “time out” where you get zero exemptions from anything. reply siva7 12 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s quite funny how we still teach THERAC-25 to students about how deadly engineering issues can get yet Boeing seems to be a much better and modern candidate to teach about bad engineering&#x2F;management practices affecting safety (MCAS). reply janice1999 12 hours agoparentI also nominate the \"Toyota Unintended Acceleration\" issue.

Donny, you&#x27;re out of your element.To correct your analogy, a career professional Formula One, IndyCar, or NASCAR driver would absolutely have a MUCH greater chance at adapting to driving an 18-wheeler than your average Joe, because they understand things like friction, turning and braking performances of different vehicles, and the visual, tactile, and auditory signs that a vehicle is or isn&#x27;t being pushed to its limits. Sure, they would have to learn the finer points of driving such a massive vehicle, but they&#x27;re starting off with advanced driving knowledge most don&#x27;t have.The average military jet pilot can perform the routine tasks of an airline pilot, and also handle inflight emergencies, by the time that they&#x27;re a twentysomething flight student who hasn&#x27;t even earned their wings yet.

(\"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.\") Large companies are complex systems; they develop their own set of internal incentives, communications architectures, org politics, membership tests, etc. Over time, these incentives inevitably adapt themselves toward maintaining the organization rather than delivering the product or service that is the reason why the organization exists. At that point, everyone who actually wants to deliver the product leaves, leaving an organization consisting solely of people whose full-time job is maintaining their position in the organization.Ask yourself: would you take a position at Boeing trying to \"fix the company\"?The only way out of this is to poach the few remaining employees that still have technical knowledge, setup a new company that refuses to employ everyone with a vested interest in Boeing, and take their market. This is hard for aerospace because of the sheer complexity of the product and the baseline quality levels needed to deliver a safe experience. reply DiggyJohnson 10 hours agorootparentI did, and it was one of the worst periods of my career.

A literal win-win.Implying there’s something negative in my comment because it’s easy to be cheaply cynical (and the cheap cynicism in the comment I originally replied to) is what’s actually wrong with the world — and why things are so bad.Who gives up on something that only has upsides without even trying? reply nostrademons 6 hours agorootparentYour line \"Sure — if I fail, I’ll just use that position as a stepping stone to my next executive role\" indicated a certain cynicism in your own post, so I was reflecting that in my response.So here&#x27;s the more detailed sincere response, based on experience working in a similar large, similarly dysfunctional technology company (and also knowing people who spent several years at Boeing specifically):It is usually not possible for a chief executive to fix a company. The reason is simply sheer complexity. A company of 100,000 people has potentially 100,000! (factorial) different working relationships within it. In practice it&#x27;s less because not everyone communicates with everybody else, but even a small department of 100 people has more different relationships than anyone can possibly keep track of. No one executive is going to know every single employee, every team, every project. And without them having those personal relationships, they don&#x27;t have enough trust to convince people to alter their behavior.If the company is in trouble in the first place, that means that the way they do business is no longer adapted to the marketplace. So you need to get the company to make changes. But if you root cause each individual problem, you find that the company is fractally fucked up. The employee is usually acting according to the incentives available to them; if they did things differently, they would fail to get the cooperation needed to accomplish their goals (at best) or lose their job (at worse). And that&#x27;s the key part: in a big company, achieving any goal, regardless of how small, requires the cooperation of many different people. In a normal functioning company things mostly work because these habits of cooperation grew up in good times, working culture & processes adapted themselves to the activities that actually made the company money, and so when people just do their jobs good things basically result. But as the company grows and ages, it ossifies. Over time they want to do things like introduce a new jetliner, but find that the right combination of people with the right skillsets to do things like make engine nacelles that don&#x27;t explode no longer exist.This is why advice for turnaround CEOs is \"get the wrong people off the bus and the right people on the bus\". And they frequently hire outsiders, or folks from much earlier in the company&#x27;s history. Their first task is to stabilize finances. Their next task is to identify the parts of the company that are still functional, then double down on them (often made harder because these folks were often laid off as part of stabilizing finances). Their next task is to sell off or lay off all the folks that are embedded in organizations that are no longer serving the company&#x27;s purposes. Remember that there are > 100K employees, and you&#x27;re building a product of exceptional engineering complexity, and that nobody knows everything the company is doing. It&#x27;s pretty hard to have enough visibility into the company&#x27;s product, engineering, supplier relationships, employee base, finances, etc. to do this correctly. replyamputect 11 hours agorootparentprevFixing the company sounds good, but you have to remember that the people who would be fixing it are the people who got it to this point in the first place.I think it&#x27;s very likely that nobody currently at Boeing has the ability and willingness to make the kinds of changes they would need to make in order to become a functional company again, because Boeing has spent over two decades systematically purging senior engineers from management and leadership in order to become another crappy company full of empty suits with MBAs, who don&#x27;t understand the product they&#x27;re making, and don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re literally killing people and the company is rotting out from under them as long as they can monetize the rot to make their quarterly numbers. reply gambiting 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat damage can they actually suffer though?

Some heads would roll for sure, maybe even the government would step in and assume direct control of certain parts of the company, but it&#x27;s not like it would go out of business, or like companies would cancel all of their orders and buy Airbuses instead - they could, but again, the US government would never allow that to happen, either through direct monetary action or promises and guarantees that whatever the worry is won&#x27;t ever happen again. reply tivert 11 hours agorootparent> What damage can they actually suffer though? Boeing is a strategic asset of the US government, they would never allow any harm to come to it.Boeing&#x27;s staff and plant are strategic assets, its executives and shareholders aren&#x27;t. The US government could totally let harm come the latter group. reply p1esk 11 hours agorootparentUS government is much more broken than Boeing. reply eastbound 11 hours agorootparentprev> What damage can they actually suffer though?Loss of market share. As in, customers actively looking at the type of aircraft when they book a ticket. Airplanes becoming reluctant to ordering Boeing.At this time, every $1 you invest in making it known what Boeing does since 15 years, results in $2 or $3 of loss of market share for Boeing. Absolutely the time to buy ads to promote articles about Boeing.I would actually trust Comac more than Boeing, as Comac has something to prove, whereas Boeing has been proven to crash planes and bribe the FAA. reply traverseda 7 hours agorootparentCan someone make a list of unsafe Boeing planes? reply nostrademons 6 hours agorootparentThe 737 MAX and 787 have both had significant issues. Basically it&#x27;s anything introduced after the merger with McDonnell Douglass in 1997. reply eastbound 4 hours agorootparentprevBoeing’s processes, not planes, are unsafe.In 2013 they received frames (the circular structures that make the fuselage) which instead of being machined, has been created manually. Voids were all in the wrong place because the workers had taken the blueprints symmetrically.Did they ditch the frames? Of course not? They remade the cuts so that it fits upside down! And soldered the I-beam parts that had been cut! Result: The circular frames, which are a critical structural component, have twice as many gaps and holes and soldered sections than the designed piece.Bulkheads, circular frames, MCAS… It’s appalling engineering practices.And the dinner party system with FAA, introduced by Mac Donnell’s practices when it was bought over, has to stop. They should not be friends in real life. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 12 hours agorootparentprevNot sure about that. I suspect that Boeing is considered a domestic strategic asset and is not allowed to die. No matter the incompetence. reply vitiral 12 hours agorootparentprevI agree, but you underestimate the cost of software in \"safety critical\" applications.I&#x27;ve heard stories of cases where development orgs were given the option of changing a line of code or re designing the hardware. They of course redesigned the hardware. reply operatingthetan 13 hours agorootparentprevYes it&#x27;s different, but similar to the comment I replied to in the sense that the machine just turns off if the user is idle for a time. reply tialaramex 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd in large ships, the Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System or BNWAS.Over night most normal operations cease, so it&#x27;s quiet on the bridge. But an officer is on duty to keep watch, because the ship is still moving, often relatively fast, and it needs a human to obey pre-existing route plan decisions, observe changing conditions, stay alert to other vessels and so on. However, the bridge (on a modern large ship) is warm and dark and at night tired humans in warm dark rooms will sleep.So BNWAS will (if operating correctly) periodically need to be \"nudged\" to show that the officer on watch is awake and somewhat paying attention. If they do nothing for a while the BNWAS will alert them and if they ignore that it will eventually alarm critical crew, often the Master (\"Captain\") of the ship or other senior officers who are asleep in their cabins.Now of course nobody wants to leave a nice dream to discover that instead of your teenage girlfriend agreeing to go on that picnic you never got to that sound is their boss, very angrily demanding to know what the fuck you&#x27;re doing curled up by the radar console. So unfortunately sometimes after a serious incident (e.g. cargo ship has \"decided\" to wait right next to a small island a few miles from the usual route from 4am until midday, and then when it gets to a dock it seems very smashed up at the bottom as though it was grounded and had to wait until higher tides lifted it clear...) we find the BNWAS has been disabled crudely (it&#x27;s not as though ship&#x27;s crew tend to be IT experts)...But this is a completely different scenario. The BNWAS is not something which causes a disaster if you forget to react, it&#x27;s an alarm to prevent such disasters which would otherwise be commonplace.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bridge_navigational_watch_alar... reply ranting-moth 13 hours agorootparentprevBack in they day sailors would stick a lit fag between their fingers when they were sailing home from day of fishing. reply kergonath 12 hours agorootparentprevEven in not-so-modern trains.

However any change like this also needs FAA testing and certification, and enough design and review to be sure the changes don&#x27;t introduce other new problems, all of which will take some time. reply pas 10 hours agorootparentyes, good, time for the FAA to force Boeing to think ahead reply ShadowBanThis01 10 hours agorootparentprevRemember that Boeing was too stupid to put an odd number of pitot tubes on their planes, so the computer could have determined which airspeed indication was crazy.

The issue here isn&#x27;t an engineering one, it&#x27;s a management one. reply tim333 8 hours agorootparentLooking it up the heating system uses bleed air from the engine so probably isn&#x27;t as easy to control. On the other hand it just has to stop the thing getting hot enough to damage carbon composite which probably isn&#x27;t anything extreme temperature wise. If you limited it to say 80C it would probably be ok to stop ice and also not fry the composite. reply exabrial 13 hours agoparentprevyou should probably not read the rest of an aviation manual then.

They have a total-air-temp displayed on the FMC and a TAT above 10°C OR not in visible moisture OR SAT* below -40°C is a good enough proxy for \"not in icing conditions\".The problem isn&#x27;t knowing whether or not you&#x27;re in possible icing conditions if you think to ask the question, but rather reliably remembering to evaluate it every single time you enter and exit possible icing conditions.* SAT - static air temp (air temp before the ram rise). reply wkat4242 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not obvious. Something with critical damage potential shouldn&#x27;t be hidden in a reading in an obscure display page where a value has to be evaluated by several rules.It should be a caution light or something at least. reply sokoloff 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not advocating that Boeing is proposing a sensible path here; I think they&#x27;re not.But ATPs don&#x27;t have any trouble evaluating \"am I in potential icing conditions?\" as they&#x27;ve been doing it for one to many thousands of hours previously. reply wkat4242 14 hours agorootparentI understand. It&#x27;s just that most accidents have not just one cause but a whole chain of them. Something small happens that causes the pilots to be distracted trying to fix it, meanwhile ignoring the elephant in the room or forgetting a &#x27;routine check&#x27;. The flight deck isn&#x27;t always a relaxed place and this is when these things can get out of hand so easily.This kind of mistake has been made so often and lives have been paid that I find it crazy that it&#x27;s still being proposed. reply cratermoon 14 hours agorootparentIn the \"swiss cheese model\" of accident causation this design is more hole than cheese. reply ledauphin 14 hours agorootparentprevbased on the article, it doesn&#x27;t sound like this has anything specifically to do with temperature - the issue is more about whether there is moisture in the air.If it were just a temperature thing, you&#x27;d think it could be automated, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really the main thing they&#x27;re dealing with here.In theory this means switching the system off when you exit the clouds.This is usually pretty noticeable, but maybe less so at night, since you might be breaking out into a pocket or a clear layer between other layers, without visibly seeing much of anything outside.I would hesitate to comment on the feasibility of this beyond what the interviewed persons have said, precisely because they&#x27;re not clarifying (to the readers in any case) what the actual thresholds here are.

Due to a misunderstanding about the design intent, planes without this option also did not display an AOA DISAGREE alert if the sensors disagreed. (I agree that such a simple situational awareness aid based on data the plane already has being a paid option is pretty absurd)However all MAXes did&#x2F;do have two AoA sensors, and prior to the fixes, regardless of the AoA display option, MCAS only considered one of them. reply eastbound 11 hours agorootparentIn the MCAS, the ‘AoA disagree’ sign allowed more freight to be carried. The pricing segmentation is based on freight, the intent was not segmentation over security levels.Even if it leaded to lowering security so much that 4 planes crashed in just a few months. reply error503 3 hours agorootparentThe AOA DISAGREE was never intended to be optional, that was a bug due to miscommunication between Boeing and the avionics manufacturer, if the congressional report is to be believed.Only the persistent numeric AoA indicator was optional. And none of this had anything to do with freight, there&#x27;s no difference in capabilities between the aircraft, it&#x27;s purely about pilot situational awareness.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boeing.mediaroom.com&#x2F;news-releases-statements?item=1... reply chem83 11 hours agorootparentprevAgree with the overall sentiment.But to pick on this point, from a systems perspective, isn&#x27;t a single thermostat still a single point of failure?

    "originBody": "News This holographic camera turns any window into an invisible camera By James Artaius published 4 January 2024 Zeiss' \"Holocam\" is a transparent camera powered by holography that turns glass windows into cameras (Image credit: Zeiss) Zeiss is bringing its remarkable Holocam technology to CES 2024, which can turn any glass screen into a camera. This means that everything from the window in your car to the screen on your laptop to the glass on your front door can now possess an invisible image sensor. Further, because the technology makes the camera completely transparent, it eliminates the need for cutouts or punch holes – meaning you can have direct eye contact with the person you're chatting to, because the camera can be placed anywhere on (or should that be in) the screen. The Holocam technology \"uses holographic in-coupling, light guiding and de-coupling elements to redirect the incoming light of a transparent medium to a hidden image sensor.\" Zeiss' CES presentation is focused around its Multifunctional Smart Glass system in general, with a focus on applications in automobiles, so many of its use cases are based around how holography can improve in-car operability. However, it's easy to see how this could be truly transformative technology in the wider world. Smart doorbells that don't need a separate camera module. Webcams that enable you to look anywhere on your screen. Parking cameras that can be completely hidden. Face or gesture recognition on any screen, including to unlock doors. Fatigue detection for drivers. Or, you know, phones and tablets without bloody notches or punch holes. Using an entire pane of glass as a camera lens also opens some fascinating optical possibilities. Some of Zeiss' bullet points include \"large aperture invisible camera\" and \"individual adjustment of orientation and size of the field of views.\" Which makes me wonder, what is the maximum aperture and focal range of a camera like this? Of course, there's a darker potential for such technology. Given the current fear around hidden cameras in Airbnbs, the idea of every single window (or even shower door) in a rental property being able to spy on you is a little disconcerting. Still, this is a fascinating bit of tech – and I'm super excited to see if and how it comes into everyday use. Doors that only open if they recognize your face sounds cool – but then, we all know how that works (or doesn't) on phones (Image credit: Zeiss) Take a look at the best dashs, the best indoo security cameras, the best spy cameras and the best hidden camera detectors.

It&#x27;ll also have pretty horrible SNR, resolution, and low light performance.Currently the structural component of this tech is mainly used in extremely high end aerospace applications (various heads up display type systems) so it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll ever run across one of these within the next decade.Nasty remote sensing tech people can be worried about right now: RF surveillance from various combinations of mmWave, wall penetrating radar, and wifi interferometry.

Regular glass isn&#x27;t 100% transparent either, even in just the visible spectrum. Shouldn&#x27;t we be more concerned with the delta in the visible spectrum is if we&#x27;re concerned about easy identification? (before mentioning that plenty of glass is purposefully tinted and dynamic tinting is an application here) And reasonably, couldn&#x27;t we, theoretically, pick up a decent signal from simply capturing the reflections around the glass edge? I mean we can now do 3D reconstructions from pointing a camera at a mirrored ball. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be very noisy, but there is signal. I mean to have the capability of projecting you&#x27;d have the ability to do the reverse too given that I doubt the internal structure of the glass would be (that) directionally dependent. Right?

I mean if someone said glass is opaque and their evidence is that you can&#x27;t see through glass and your evidence is to point at UV light... well... you&#x27;d be technically correct but you&#x27;re talking from a different ballpark. reply xyzzy_plugh 7 hours agorootparentTypically people can see better in the dark than imaging sensors can (only considering visible spectrum here), especially small sensors. If you redirect the light somewhere, what would you see? How much light would you need to divert?If the image is grayscale and has very high gain&#x2F;noise&#x2F;ISO, then I imagine with a low enough frame rate you could avoid noticable tinting. You would likely still notice the tint in comparison to regular glass, I&#x27;m too lazy to do the napkin math though.Practically speaking, I would expect it to be strictly more noticeable than glass for holographic projection. If true, it&#x27;s likely noticeable.But the eye is fickle. You don&#x27;t notice the tint of, say, a car window when you&#x27;ve been inside for a bit. Or sunglasses.Here&#x27;s an arbitrary Google search result for in-glass HUDs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lumineq.com&#x2F;applications&#x2F;automotiveThey state their glass is 70% transparent. That&#x27;s definitely noticeably opaque. reply godelski 5 hours agorootparent> in the darkI don&#x27;t think how you framed this is accurate. The quality is a function of the pixel size and of course the exposure time. I mean those are the two main variables that control how much light hits the sensor, but we&#x27;d have to get into sensitivity to make direct comparisons (human eyes are VERY sensitive and some evidence that the average eye is sensitive to a single photon, but you&#x27;re not going to see well with that and this is besides the point).Definitely not a straight forward calculation and I&#x27;m feeling too lazy to go grab my optics books. But guesstimating here, there should be enough light considering you can see light and distortions when looking at the side of a pane. So I&#x27;d lean on it being more about the quality of the signal. Which glass is highly structured but I&#x27;m assuming that this type of glass has some unique optical properties to specifically make the side panels have higher quality signals. My understanding is that they are projecting from the side, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m inferring from -- basically just reverse the photon direction through the medium and I don&#x27;t have reason to believe that quality is directionally dependent (should I?). My whole spitballing is dependent on this understanding.> it&#x27;s likely noticeable.Well one user said they didn&#x27;t notice it.> They state their glass is 70% transparent. That&#x27;s definitely noticeably opaque.That&#x27;s not uncommon for Low-E glass, so maybe not very noticeable, especially in many different environments. But yeah, I think if you compared side by side you&#x27;d notice. I think we&#x27;re just using different criteria and we probably decently align?Idk, I am mostly thinking aloud here, so I do want to portray that I don&#x27;t have high confidence here. It&#x27;s been 10 years since I&#x27;ve been in an optics lab lol. But I&#x27;ve built microphones with really weak signals before and they are useful. Distorted, but useful. (Definitely not fun being forced to run experiments at 3am and find out someone is walking around on the other side of the building...) So I can&#x27;t see why this couldn&#x27;t (theoretically) be similarly done for a window? I definitely don&#x27;t think this would work with a typical pane of glass, especially considering how they&#x27;re cut, but this does seem like specialty glass specifically built for directing photons directed from an edge to the pane face. Any idea if it can only display to one face? (I&#x27;m sure you can invert img but projection face probably matters for a camera?) reply hnbad 11 hours agorootparentprevNeither do most storefront windows and yet they&#x27;re often made to reduce the transmission of UV light to protect displayed goods from sunlight or intentionally darkened so they&#x27;re less transparent when the display is not lit up.

Doing the reverse, that is receiving a signal, is brand spanking new fresh out the cow hot shit at any frequency. reply xyzzy_plugh 13 hours agorootparentNo, it&#x27;s not really new. Small form factor is relatively new but even then the issue lies in yield and quality control.Projector light engines include potentially many light-beam forming condensing and projection lenses precisely to concentrate light into a uniform quadrilateral. That&#x27;s not new. The industry continues to advance, though.Even holographic projection isn&#x27;t new. This is just that, except the light is (sort of) taking the reverse path.Technically there is no reason why it can&#x27;t also project light outwards simultaneously. However light guides aren&#x27;t really reversible like that: the light usually exits through a small fraction of the guide&#x27;s external surface area. Reversing that means the entire external surface area is potentially collecting light, which would result in some undesirable caustics in all scenarios I can imagine. Light engines are in part designed to account for this (by reflecting or sinking light into an absorber) but this is still pretty different from what Zeiss is promoting.For a small permanent installation where you are in control of the lighting I could see this working relatively well, but I have a hard time imagining you could get close anything resembling photo quality without a lot of environmental treatment. Conversely holographic projection is pretty doable on a mobile platform like a headset.This is pretty new only in that it&#x27;s probably at least an order of magnitude more difficult to accomplish and thus hasn&#x27;t been viable up until now. Fundamentally none of the concepts are new, as far as I can tell.As an example look at your nearest window and imagine it divided into a grid of uniform pixels. Each pixel is a small mirror that reflects a point of focus (wherever you are) to a another, smaller point on an imaging sensor somewhere in the frame. This would look pretty jarring (and jagged) to most people, until you layer a complimentary piece of glass on top of it to make the exterior flush. The two pieces of glass would be high enough precision that once you put them together they are effectively one piece of glass.

It&#x27;s a translation from German which makes it a bit tougher to parse than the usual patent.The total lack of any deeper information beyond the bold yet vague claims in the press release is frustrating. The PR makes it sound like a miraculous breakthrough destined to change everything. The source release on the Zeiss site only adds two bits of info.> \"The transparency of the holographic layer has only a minimal effect on the brilliance of the image reproduction. It is also possible to detect spectral components as additional information to complement the visible image. The resulting data provide insights into environmental contamination such as air pollution and UV exposure.\"However, experience shows that in reality bold+vague claims like this inevitably come with significant trade-offs and constraints which limit its applications (little things like cost, power, fidelity, size, speed, etc). This is especially true in early implementations of new tech. That said, it may still be both interesting and useful. Unfortunately, we have no way to even think about how it might be useful because Zeiss marketing has chosen to play &#x27;hide the ball&#x27; instead of just releasing a technical explainer outlining relevant trade-offs, limitations, etc.If I was talking to someone from Zeiss my first questions would be about how much the additional components impact the optical characteristics of the glass, what the resolution of the resulting image data is, how large are the components needed at the edges and how far away can they be from the capture zone? Then, of course, how the output of the resulting imaging system maps into traditional camera&#x2F;lens metrics like f-stops, aperture, imager size&#x2F;density, gain, focal length, etc. Zeiss is an optics company after all. reply mannykannot 11 hours agoparentThanks for finding this.The paper mentioned in the Description section can be read here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;52566311&#x2F;_title_Volume_phase_hologr...My guess is that each of the items in patent diagram labeled 20 and 22 are gratings of this sort, perhaps with the fringes angled at 45 degrees.Some additional info may be gleaned from the one patent citing this one, invented by one of the co-inventors of the latter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;DE102019206354A1&#x2F;en reply pushcx 15 hours agoprevI spent a few minutes looking for more info, doesn&#x27;t seem that Zeiss has published anything but a press release yet: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zeiss.com&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;en&#x2F;about-zeiss&#x2F;present&#x2F;newsr... reply fourteenfour 15 hours agoparentHere&#x27;s their CES page with a video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exhibitors.ces.tech&#x2F;8_0&#x2F;exhibitor&#x2F;exhibitor-details.... reply tasty_freeze 8 hours agorootparentThis video is nothing but holographic displays.

Eye contact moving between participants is the gel that holds conversations together and it&#x27;s why video calls are still stuck in the conference call era in terms of talking over one another. reply toomim 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not just cultural.

Eye contact with a dog communicates dominance.You&#x27;ve just acclimated to losing that signal during video chats. Bring it back, and you&#x27;ll have a richer experience.More generally, we have evolved special neural hardware to recognize gaze, with a special case for when gaze is directed at our eyes.

And as Herb Simon said: \"in the information age, attention is the scarce resource.\" reply krisoft 14 hours agoparentprev> but now that just seems like a cultural hangup that arose from people not being familiar with video calling.Eye contact is about as old as humankind. So maybe in 300,000 years we can check if we get over it with video calls.It is not that communication is not possible without it. It just removes an additional layer.Eye contact conveys all kind of useful meta data. Depending on the circumstances and other verbal and non-verbal cues it can mean \"I&#x27;m listening to you\", \"oh, maybe let&#x27;s push more on this topic\", \"have you also caught that?\", \"perhaps it would be wiser to not talk about that\", \"i&#x27;m specifically addressing you\" or \"can you help me out here?\". And these are just the ones immediately applicable in business settings. Let&#x27;s not even talk about all the ways it can be used during flirting.And it works on a subconscious level. I regularly DM role playing games, both online and in-person. The lack of eye contact is a serious impediment in online games. One can use eye contact, or the lack of it to judge engagement. One can signal with eye contact turns or who an NPC is talking to. It can also be used to help less talkative players seize amazing role playing moments.Can we get by without it? Sure.

If they buy a DSLR or mirrorless camera, they&#x27;re going to use the kit lens and leave the mode dial on auto. For people who just want to point and shoot, the iPhone&#x27;s computational brilliance shines through.The iPhone isn&#x27;t so much a camera as a generative algorithm that happens to use image sensor data as a prompt.

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT U.S. Moves Closer to Filing Sweeping Antitrust Case Against Apple Justice Department officials are in the late stages of investigating the iPhone maker, focusing on how Apple has used its other products and services to defend against threats to its core business. Share full article The Justice Department is focused on how Apple has used its control over the iPhone’s software and hardware to make its devices and services work better together. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times By David McCabe and Tripp Mickle David McCabe, who covers tech policy, reported from Washington. Tripp Mickle, who covers Apple, reported from San Francisco. Jan. 5, 2024 The Justice Department is in the late stages of an investigation into Apple and could file a sweeping antitrust case taking aim at the company’s strategies to protect the dominance of the iPhone as soon as the first half of this year, said three people with knowledge of the matter. The agency is focused on how Apple has used its control over its hardware and software to make it more difficult for consumers to ditch the company’s devices, as well as for rivals to compete, said the people, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was active. Specifically, investigators have examined how the Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brands, as well as how Apple locks competitors out of its iMessage service. They have also scrutinized Apple’s payments system for the iPhone, which blocks other financial firms from offering similar services, these people said. Senior leaders in the Justice Department’s antitrust division are reviewing the results of the investigation so far, said two of the people. The agency’s officials have met with Apple multiple times, including in December, to discuss the investigation. No final decision has been made about whether a lawsuit should be filed or what it should include, and Apple has not had a final meeting with the Justice Department in which it can make its case to the government before a lawsuit is filed. The Justice Department is closing in on what would be the most consequential federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple, which is the most valuable tech company in the world. If the lawsuit is filed, American regulators will have sued four of the biggest tech companies for monopolistic business practices in less than five years. The Justice Department is currently facing off against Google in two antitrust cases, focused on its search and ad tech businesses, while the Federal Trade Commission has sued Amazon and Meta for stifling competition. The Apple suit would likely be even more expansive than previous challenges to the company, attacking its powerful business model that draws together the iPhone with devices like the Apple Watch and services like Apple Pay to attract and keep consumers loyal to its products. Rivals have said that they have been denied access to key Apple features, like the Siri virtual assistant, prompting them to argue the practices are anticompetitive. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment for this article. Apple also declined to comment. The company has previously said that its practices do not violate antitrust law. In defending its business practices against critics in the past, Apple said that its “approach has always been to grow the pie” and “create more opportunities not just for our business, but for artists, creators, entrepreneurs and every ‘crazy one’ with a big idea.” The company prides itself on the way the iPhone integrates hardware and software to create a seamless customer experience. In 2020, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said during testimony before a congressional antitrust committee that the company redefined mobile phones with “its effortless user experience, its simplicity of design and a high-quality ecosystem.” He added that Apple competed against Samsung, LG, Google and other smartphone makers, which offer a different approach. “Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,” Mr. Cook said at the time. “That is not just true for iPhone; it is true for any product category.” The case would add to the growing regulatory pressure both domestically and abroad cutting into Apple’s business, currently valued at $2.83 trillion. This year, European regulators are expected to force Apple to accommodate app stores beyond its own under the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 to rein in tech giants. Similar actions against the App Store have been taken or are under consideration in South Korea and Japan. Additionally, the European Commission said in 2021 that Apple had violated its antitrust laws by imposing app store fees on competitors to its Apple Music product. The commission’s investigation into the issue is continuing. The resolution of the Justice Department’s investigation could be affected by the details of how Apple complies with European regulations, said two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was ongoing. Apple is facing the increased regulatory pressure as its business slows. Last year, the company reported its annual revenue fell 2.8 percent, to $383 billion, its first decline in a fiscal year since 2019, as sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs slowed. Still, the company sold more than 200 million iPhones and accounted for nearly three-quarters of the smartphones sold worldwide that were priced above $600, analysts estimate. When the Justice Department started its tech investigations in 2019, it prioritized its antitrust review of Google over Apple because it lacked the financial resources and personnel to fully evaluate both companies, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That changed in 2022 after the department’s budget increased. The investigation has encompassed a wider span of Apple’s business interests than previously reported, said six people with knowledge of the meetings. That includes how Apple has blocked cloud gaming apps, which let users stream a multitude of titles to their phones, from being offered in its App Store. Investigators spoke with executives at Tile, the Bluetooth tracking service, about Apple’s competing AirTag product and the company’s restrictions to outside parties on access to the iPhone’s location services. Executives at Beeper, a start-up that made iMessage available on Android phones, spoke with investigators about how Apple blocked it from making it possible to offer messaging across competing smartphone operating systems. Investigators also had conversations with banks and payment apps about how Apple prevents them from accessing the tap-to-pay function on iPhones. Tile and Beeper declined to comment for this article. They have also looked at how the Apple Watch works better alongside the iPhone than other competing smartwatches. Users of Garmin devices have complained in Apple’s support forums about being unable to use their watches to reply to certain text messages from their iPhones or tweak the notifications they receive from the iPhone that they have connected to their watch. Apple’s new privacy tool, App Tracking Transparency, which allows iPhone users to explicitly choose whether an app can track them, drew scrutiny because of its curtailing of user data collection by advertisers. Advertising companies have said that the tool is anticompetitive. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, encouraged the Justice Department to look at the issue in its conversations with the agency, two of the people said. The company — which makes most of its money from advertising — said in 2022 that it could lose roughly $10 billion in revenue that year because of the changes. Meta declined to comment. Investigators have also examined Apple’s policy of applying fees to purchases made inside of iPhone apps, which companies like Spotify and the dating app powerhouse Match Group say is anticompetitive. In 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple over the App Store’s requirement that developers use the tech giant’s payment system. A federal judge found that Apple didn’t have a monopoly in mobile games, dealing a major blow to Epic’s claim. When Epic Games sued Google over similar claims, it got a different result. A jury ruled in December that Google’s app store policies had violated antitrust laws. Google plans to appeal the verdict. The Justice Department last sued Apple in 2012, accusing it of conspiring with book publishers to raise the price of digital books. Apple lost the case and paid a $450 million settlement.

I&#x27;ve had to to completely decouple my phone number from my imessage email to be able to chat with people. Frequently things get messed up because iOS will always default to imessage over sms, so if your primary way to talk is via sms, but you do have an imessage and the person has both in your contact card you don&#x27;t actually get anything on your phone. I can&#x27;t really see how it isn&#x27;t anticompetitive. reply hangonhn 13 hours agoparentAs an iPhone user, I find it super annoying too.

Thus, no baked in support for Cast (except in the Apple Music app on Android). As far as Apple is concerned, if you are visiting a friend and want to play some music on his Chromecast, the solution is to buy your friend an Apple TV for AirPlay. reply davisr 12 hours agorootparentFree software (libre -- free as in freedom) is the antidote to this entire mess.

For example, a long time ago in computer years, Apple rolled out \"Yellow Box for Windows\" which was a way to get NeXTStep apps running on Windows http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shawcomputing.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;apple&#x2F;os_pictures&#x2F;ybn... as part of Rhapsody Developer Release 2 (this was a prerelease OS X)... and then promptly ditched it.Being able to develop once and then deploy to both OS X and Windows sounds great to developers, but think about this: If you had access to Mac apps from a Windows machine, then why would you buy a Mac, when Apple is competing on quality and not price? It&#x27;d be a win for app developers but a big \"lose\" for Apple.So why would Apple have ever built a way to cast to Google Cast if they already had an AppleTV product that wasn&#x27;t competing on price with Google Cast? (AppleTV&#x27;s are great, btw) reply jorvi 12 hours agorootparent> So why would Apple have ever built a way to cast to Google Cast if they already had an AppleTV product that wasn&#x27;t competing on price with Google Cast? (AppleTV&#x27;s are great, btw)Because it makes iPhone and Mac users their (digital) life better?Let me give you a different example: you visit a hotel. They have Cast-enabled TV’s, but those do not support AirPlay. Anyone with an iPhone or Mac is SoL. It literally goes against Apple’s old “It Just Works” adage, when they probably would have looked at Cast as just another protocol to support. The only reason to do that is if you think the net decrease in usability will increase the company’s profitability via lock-in.To be clear, it is not just Apple doing this. A different vector is a product like YouTube: often when I’m scrolling the comments after a video ends, an ad will play that extends down vertically, making me tap it. If I swipe it away, the entire screen shifts again, but now there is an ad strip at the bottom, that I accidentally tap again, taking me out of the app. This is obviously horrid UX, but Google doesn’t care because the only thing Google wants from you is eyes on ads. They don’t have to deliver a good product (users first), they just have to make the product barely not-shitty-enough that you won’t leave.A great counter-example is 1Password: they support numerous ways to export their own or import other services their vaults. If you have a running subscription with a competitor, they will credit you the remainder of your bill if you switch. If you asks customer support for help if you are switching to, say, Bitwarden, they’ll help you. They believe in their product and that you’ll either come back or stick with them because it is the best on the market. Which frankly, for now, it is. Due to user-first perspective :) reply NickFanion 10 hours agorootparentYou’re making a good point, but I don’t think this is fair to AirPlay. You don’t need an Apple TV to use AirPlay. My LG TV supports AirPlay. I recently stayed at an Airbnb with a TV running Roku OS. It supported AirPlay as well. Sonos and various other speakers and AV equipment support audio-only AirPlay.When AirPlay launched in 2010, Google Cast didn’t exist. EDIT: TV manufacturers only started adding AirPlay (now “AirPlay 2”) in 2019. Still, I think it’s reasonable to expect a modern device, without extra hardware, to support AirPlay. reply jorvi 9 hours agorootparentIdeally of course Apple would bake in Cast and Google would bake in AirPlay 2. Best case for users, worst case for them.Much more tangential but AirPlay (even AirPlay 2) is hot garbage for music due to the gigantic audio buffers. When I press “play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;next”, I want my command to process immediately, not after 2-3 seconds. reply soperj 11 hours agorootparentprev> Because it makes iPhone and Mac users their (digital) life better?They have never cared about this. reply jorvi 11 hours agorootparentYou should really watch a bunch of the old Jobs videos.A prime example is price. Jobs’ was asked why they didn’t make a competing MacBook at the $600 Windows laptop price point (I think this was the mid 2000s?). He said that it might have sold really well but that they would have to severely degrade the user experience to hit that price point, and he refused to do that because he wanted to make great devices.Back in those days you could plug any non-exotic device into a Mac, and it would mostly just work instantly, which was paradise compared to XP and 7’s driver and .dll hell. These days, I’d expect Apple to do stuff like patch the AirPods Max firmware to break the Android apps that enable all the cool non-basic features. reply bloppe 12 hours agorootparentprevGoogle can and has done the same thing. They stopped supporting YouTube on FireTV because Amazon refused to sell ChromeCast devices on their website. All these competitors have options to force you to buy their hardware just to use their services and vice versa. Google could start slowly degrading all their services for users without Chromebooks. Microsoft could force you to buy a Windows phone just to use ChatGPT.Clearly, all of this is bad for users across the board. Apple is by far the most aggressive when it comes to this kind of anticompetitive bundling. You can&#x27;t just say \"of course they want to be anticompetitive, that&#x27;s just business!\". You&#x27;re supposed to not let them pull this shit. reply pmarreck 13 hours agorootparentprev> One of my friends has an iPhone but turned off iMessage out of an abundance of cautionIn my experience, iMessages have far greater delivery reliability than SMS text messages.I&#x27;ve actually gotten into inadvertent fights with people over undelivered SMS text messages. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentThe issue isn&#x27;t that Apple should be using SMS in particular -- SMS sucks. But they should either use some standardized protocol, or publish a protocol standard for iMessage.Someone willing to do the work should be capable of producing an interoperable implementation. reply Jtsummers 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ll get your wish later this year with iOS support for RCS. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentNot exactly.It&#x27;s a step in the right direction but it&#x27;s the same problem as iMessage supporting SMS in addition to its own protocol. If the proprietary protocol supports something the open protocol doesn&#x27;t, or that Apple doesn&#x27;t implement for the open protocol, a competing implementation can&#x27;t do it. And if it doesn&#x27;t do that then why does the proprietary protocol exist?If you&#x27;re going to make your own protocol, publish a spec. reply peyton 10 hours agorootparentIsn’t iMessage a service, not a protocol? Should I be able to operate a business that sends bulk advertisements to iMessage users? reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> Isn’t iMessage a service, not a protocol?It&#x27;s a service and a protocol and a client application.But it should be possible for a third party to make an interoperating client application using the same protocol, and then it could connect to any service implementing that protocol.Obviously if you want to be selective in who can use your service then you should create a protocol that supports some kind of federation so that each user&#x27;s service can forward messages to another service if the two endpoints don&#x27;t use the same one. Email works like this, for example.> Should I be able to operate a business that sends bulk advertisements to iMessage users?Can you do this now by using a Mac with iMessage? reply naravara 11 hours agorootparentprevThe touchy part is the end-to-end encryption. The whole point is that Apple is the trusted party there. As an iMessage user I don’t want my messages passing through who knows which other parties’ servers when I send messages to others.The point of the blue bubble is to ensure the encryption is there. reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparentEnd-to-end encryption is where the client device encrypts the message and then the other end&#x27;s client device decrypts the message. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many servers it goes through, none of them can read it, that&#x27;s the entire point of end-to-end encryption.The hard part is associating some identity with the user&#x27;s keys, but when the ID is your phone number or email address, the entity doing that is inherently your phone company or email provider. You can standardize a way to do that, i.e. to sign up you get an SMS or email with a code and have to enter the code. The client can automate that if it has access to read your SMS or email, or otherwise you enter it manually. reply Sabinus 8 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re an iMessage user, don&#x27;t you want your messages to non apple users to be encrypted?Kicking them out of the system makes your messages less secure, not more secure. reply crazygringo 11 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;ve actually gotten into inadvertent fights with people over undelivered SMS text messages.Oh, man.Thankfully I haven&#x27;t had an undelivered text in over a decade.But back in the early-to-mid 2000s, it was maybe a 5% failure rate in the country I was living in then? With no indication.And yes it really did cause arguments with romantic partners. There were times I had to pull out my phone and prove I&#x27;d asked&#x2F;invited&#x2F;told them whatever. But it&#x27;s not like that ever really fixes the situation either.But if you asked anyone to confirm they&#x27;d gotten your message you seemed paranoid or needy.You just couldn&#x27;t win. So much friction. reply godelski 12 hours agoparentprev> but as an android user I really do get cut out of group message convos due to not being on imessage.I&#x27;ll second this complaint. Though personally I try to use Signal with my friends and this led to the strategy of \"it&#x27;s like iMessage, but cross platform\" for those who aren&#x27;t security conscious. Sure, not exactly, but close enough. There&#x27;s a lot I like about Apple, but the closed walls are a major hindrance. I really wish companies would see the value of open source or at least open protocols. I mean hasn&#x27;t our entire technological framework essentially been built due to source code being available? Certainly we can point to the internet, android, any programming language, linux, and many other common systems that we use daily (knowingly or unknowingly). I mean it&#x27;s like turning down free work... Why? reply sircastor 9 hours agorootparent> I mean it&#x27;s like turning down free work... Why?When you&#x27;re in a competitive industry, you want to commodify the spaces where your competitors have an advantage, and keep proprietary the spaces where you have the advantage. A good example is Google&#x27;s early embrace of XMPP. They made their chat system use the open standard and then when they had a strong base, they started to build proprietary things on top of the standard. Then they were diverged enough and it was their way or the highway. It was a page out of Microsoft&#x27;s book. I think Google really could have owned modern chat if they&#x27;d stayed-the-course with one of the chat systems they announced.Open source is a great philosophy, but whenever you adopt it you&#x27;re (potentially) funding and doing development work for your competitor. In theory those competitors are going to also contribute, but it&#x27;s often assumed that competitors are fair players. That you&#x27;ll both be trying to make the best thing. Your competitor might simply take your work, and undercut you on price. You&#x27;re left holding the bill for all the work you put in, and they make a profit (Smaller than you would have, but their cost was negliable) reply godelski 5 hours agorootparent> Open source is a great philosophySo I guess I should be clear, I&#x27;m thinking source available. I know Open Source is a loaded word.But doesn&#x27;t this kinda support my thinking? They accelerated by using the open tools and then slowed once they had a more mature product? I mean we&#x27;ve seen huge advancements in LLaMA and StableDiffusion because of their open source-ness. One could argue that GPT is also getting major benefits from this, but I think also partially because it&#x27;s the most common LLM to perform analysis on (which is a bit weird that researchers do this on a closed source&#x2F;data model...)I definitely get the argument around your competitor being able to snag your work, but if we&#x27;re talking about source available then that becomes a legal matter. And truth be told, we could say the same about a lot of hardware. I mean anything hardware you can visibly inspect.I definitely don&#x27;t know how that all plays out in literal numbers and I do wonder if there is some counterfactual data out there. I&#x27;m just highly suspicious that it isn&#x27;t as big of a cost as many assume it is. Even software you can do a really good job at cloning if you have access to it (even if completely black box). There&#x27;s definitely costs, my question is just how much this compares to benefits. And is source available cost being confused with first mover cost?

And all of these are treated differently!iMessages from the same person will end up in 3 different conversations based on whether they specified (for that conversation) only their cell number as the recipient identifier, only their email address as the recipient identifier, OR BOTH! Which is of course madness. Which is why I tell everyone within earshot to ONLY check off the cell number identifier (even on their non-cell devices) and uncheck ALL other identifiers, for sanity.

It&#x27;s not a matter of getting someone to do the work.It&#x27;s that messaging systems have a network effect, so when one comes as the default on a device with a billion users, it has a big network regardless of whether or not a competing protocol might be just as good.

In general, companies have no duty to deal with competitors.

By its terms that would nominally be a violation.As a result most of what you have to look at is case law. But antitrust cases are rare to begin with and ones dealing with this kind of \"huge conglomerate that ties its products and services together with computer code\" -- try to name one dealing with a company of that nature other than Microsoft. Maybe AT&T? It&#x27;s not a lot of precedent until you&#x27;re looking at cases of much smaller companies doing much narrower things, which leaves plenty of room for the judge to \"distinguish\" them (i.e. do whatever they want in this case).> In general, companies have no duty to deal with competitors.It seems like a major difference here isn&#x27;t just that they won&#x27;t deal with competitors, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t allow their customers to deal with competitors. This is quite stark when you&#x27;re looking at their products -- someone who owns an iPhone can&#x27;t reasonably modify or replace the system software to integrate a competing payments system (or, for that matter, app store) because Apple doesn&#x27;t allow it even on a piece of hardware they sold and is now owned by someone else.You could make that argument for services, i.e. iMessage, but there are at least two other ways to get at that. First, iMessage is tied to their other offerings and so then you get them for the tying. Second, maybe routing something with a network effect through a centralized service is a different kind of thing than refusing to provide your competitors with delivery service when you don&#x27;t have a monopoly on delivery service.

If MS had its own hardware, they would have been free to do what they wanted with it.In fact, Apple will like argue (and has successfully already in the Epic case) that it&#x27;s the entire ecosystem that the courts have to look at and not any single feature.

The difference that you are missing, and that was addressed is how Microsoft levereged their market postion in the OS market (>85% in the late 1990&#x27;s) to stop vendors and OEM pre-packaging an alternative browser; USA vs Microsoft was never about IE being bundled - that came later and that was the EU - it was always about how they killed the main competitor to their browser with threats.* Edited for spelling reply Spivak 13 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re talking past the issue.When Microsoft tells OEMs -- someone not Microsoft, \"we won&#x27;t license you Windows unless you include and set as default Internet Explorer\" that&#x27;s anticompetitive.It&#x27;s the act of using your pull of needing to buy Windows get another business to do something unrelated.MS could absolutely not allow you to have any other browser without it being anticompetitive, to wit this is what happens on Xbox.This is why Apple won and Google lost their case with Epic. Google tried to have an open platform but then used their pull with gapps to force OEMs to privilege the Play store.

Apple&#x27;s early adoption of USB is why USB became the dominant peripheral interface. People were quite upset to have lost their legacy ports in 1998.And of course, Apple&#x27;s contributions to and early support for USB-C were also industry-leading. Apple has played a key role in creating and&#x2F;or mainstreaming many standards: FireWire, Thunderbolt, Wi-Fi, ISOBMFF&#x2F;MPEG-4, AAC, Mini-SIM&#x2F;Nano-SIM, and I&#x27;m sure more I&#x27;m forgetting. reply CharlesW 12 hours agorootparent(In a now-deleted post, the parent commenter requested citations, and also remembered Apple dragging their feet on TCP&#x2F;IP support.

Offices that have SCSI- or parallel-port printers will find the iMac an unsuitable replacement for older Macs. It’s odd, because Apple was a SCSI pioneer.”It&#x27;s true that AppleTalk was proprietary, but it was introduced in 1985. It was plug-and-play, amazing for its time, and showed what standards-based networking should aspire to.Apple&#x27;s MacTCP was the first OS-level, application-independent TCP&#x2F;IP stack for personal computers, in 1988 — many years before TCP&#x2F;IP was mainstream.

People are often lazy and&#x2F;or not super tech literate, so for example when someone wants to send a couple pics from an event they&#x27;ll default to iPhone-only group chat to avoid destroying the quality of the image, rather than using a different sharing mechanism. This is sometimes accompanied by a misunderstanding that Android phones are at fault for the downsampling, when actually it is the iPhone causing the issue and getting away with it due to majority rule.Additionally, when you first make the switch (at least circa 5 years ago), any iPhone-only group chats you were already in will need to be restarted (with some care taken by each iPhone user involved), otherwise you will not receive those messages because iOS will continue to treat it as an iMessage on others&#x27; end. It is very easy to miss out on communications this way, and from there it&#x27;s not all that hard to fall out of touch with people who weren&#x27;t closer friends to begin with. Either you need to be proactive or your larger social circle needs to be thoughtful and&#x2F;or really like you.So with all these issues, there is a bit of extra work involved for everyone when Android phones are involved. Some circles are so iPhone-heavy already it would be a little awkward to be that guy making the whole chat green. Couple it with a false perception that Android coincides with lower socioeconomic status (obviously not true for certain devices anyway) and it&#x27;s easy to see shallow people being petty about them. Plus less tech literate circles just accidentally excluding people and you get a real fear of social hurdles. reply dqv 11 hours agorootparentprev> Are there really people that adjust their social circles based on what type of phone someone is using?Your wording suggests it&#x27;s an active decision where they immediately cut someone out because the communication turns green. And for some, it is an active decision. It&#x27;s a common \"joke\" to poke fun at people for making the bubbles green too. But the more insidious way it arises is like how you might see patches of grass dying off due to shade and eventually turning to dirt. Someone sends a meme or a video or a picture to the MMS friendgroup, no one can see it as it was originally intended, so the iPhone users create a \"sidechannel\" (way easier than moving to an entirely different app) iMessage group where they share the memes and videos. Eventually the culture between the MMS friendgroup and the sidechannel friendgroup diverge until they no longer associate. The blue grass grows while the green grass turns into a patch of dirt. reply phyllistine 12 hours agorootparentprevPeople will specifically not add android users to group texts. If I am making a casual group text, and there is one android user, it may just be easier to not add a person than turn everyone&#x27;s text boxes green, reduce image size, etc.Not social standing per se, but a 0.01% chance of being excluded isn&#x27;t going to feel good. reply matwood 12 hours agorootparentprevNot so much adjust circles, but typically (obviously not always) Androids are seen as cheap and iPhones are seen as premium.

Like images are downsampled to hell if a single Android user is in an iPhone group chat -- but any time I&#x27;ve texted groups containing only various Android phones, images are decent quality (even if the members are using different text messaging platforms, so not like this is a Google Messages or Samsung thing).Idc about green bubbles or cloud access&#x2F;being integrated with the Apple ecosystem, but the core functionality should be decent. They should not be using outdated standards for non-Apple messages, which sure seems like a ploy to keep people away from Android. reply matwood 12 hours agoparentprevWithout legislation dictating interop of all messaging platforms, I don&#x27;t see how iMessage would ever be opened up.

Nobody I know cares what kind of phone you have. But they do care if you have iMessage or not.Lack of iMessage essentially breaks group chats. So if you don&#x27;t have iMessage, and everyone else does, you will intentionally not be added to the chat.Lack of iMessage also means sending videos to you is going to take additional steps compared to other iMessage users. So they likely just won&#x27;t send you the video.Over time, the additional steps required to include a non-iMessage user, means you will receive less messages from your friends.I don&#x27;t like the situation, but that&#x27;s how it is. If the majority of your friends&#x2F;contacts use iMessage but you don&#x27;t, then you will be excluded from chats. Not because you use Android, but because it is just more difficult to include you without iMessage. reply chewmieser 11 hours agoprevGift link:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;05&#x2F;technology&#x2F;antitrust-appl... reply nova22033 12 hours agoprevSpecifically, investigators have examined how the Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brandsApple is under no obligation to make sure that the Apple watch works well with an android phone.

For example iOS has several silent default-opt-in location data features that I do not want or need, and at the same time it regularly tries to trick me into disabling location features of Google Maps, that I&#x27;ve used daily since 2005.The other issue is the constant nagging, that can&#x27;t be disabled, about iCloud backups being full, when in fact I never wanted them in the first place and as far as I can tell or recall they stole that data from me. reply kstrauser 13 hours agoparent> it regularly tries to trick me into disabling location features of Google Maps, that I&#x27;ve used daily since 2005.Citation needed. I periodically get popups for even Apple&#x27;s own first-party apps asking if I still want to share location. \"Do you still want Weather to know where you are?\" Yes, I do, because I use it. You may very well be getting the same message for Google apps, but that&#x27;s not special anti-Google behavior.> The other issue is the constant nagging, that can&#x27;t be disabled, about iCloud backups being fullThen turn off iCloud backups. It&#x27;s an optional feature that makes sense to be on by default, but that&#x27;s trivially easy to disable if you don&#x27;t want it. reply jeffbee 13 hours agorootparent> Citation needed.Apple launders the location features of Apple Maps through platform location service controls. iOS will never, ever prompt you about Maps&#x27; own background location access. The controls for Maps&#x27; background location access are buried in System Services, and are defaulted on, and do not produce the tracking nag. The fact that the first-party Weather app is not also immune to the nag doesn&#x27;t seem material.The whole situation is in stark contrast to Android, where if you throw the phone in a drawer for a few months the platform will automatically revoke all of the privacy allowances of Google&#x27;s own apps. Which is maybe not great, since resuming the use of such a device is sort of impossible (it will prompt you for shit like whether Phone is allowed to record audio), but you can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s anti privacy. reply wharvle 13 hours agorootparent... I wonder if the Maps app itself plays some role in providing Location services.

Where do you see documented that Maps is immune from location permission popups? And if you&#x27;re not using Apple Maps, what indication have you see that it&#x27;s using your location?

After contacting support, they then claimed that someone had gained access to my credentials.What evidence did they have? None. I just updated a VM&#x27;s metadata too frequently (about once a minute). This tripped an ML model, which caused them to automatically terminate my account and send an automated email saying that I had been a bad boy.This took down a key part of my business for about 5 hours (while I navigated my way through layers of customer support and ultimately temporarily moved this functionality to another cloud provider). Customers were not happy.It took about 2 weeks and multiple support tickets for the full story to come out. I got them to refund a few months of charges (amounted to several hundred dollars at the time) and restore my account. There was never any recognition that they made a mistake.I get that companies need to resort to automated means to handle fraud or abuse. But they should also own up to it, add some humility in their automated outreach to customers (\"our automated system has detected possible X\" instead of \"you are guilty\"), provide clear escalation paths to talk to a human, and provide a way to \"shield\" your account (identity verification, upfront deposit of $X, etc) that forces them to contact you before any enforcement action.In my case, I upgraded to a paid support plan ($100+ per month) in the hopes that their system will be a little less trigger happy with my account in the future. I don&#x27;t use support at all, it&#x27;s purely a lame form of insurance that may or may not actually protect against anything. reply davely 15 hours agoparentWhen these algorithms get it wrong, it completely sucks. And since no tech company has any semblance of customer support, you&#x27;re completely hosed.With respect to Facebook: I posted a shop vac last April for $50. I got a message that I was banned from using marketplace for \"violating community guidelines.\"However, if you believe this happened in error, you could request a review.So I did! And was denied. I did this process a few more times and each time was denied. Once I requested a review for the third (or fourth?) time, I received a message that said \"Unfortunately, your account cannot be reinstated due to violating community guidelines. The review is final.\"I have no idea what happened.So now, I can&#x27;t use Facebook Marketplace because of some stupid error in their algorithm that can&#x27;t be ever appealed. Which is a bummer, because I&#x27;ve legitimately found some good electronic finds on there (and have been able to offload things I don&#x27;t have use for).Meanwhile, their algorithms for advertising and marketing useless stuff to us are just perfect. A passage from Yuval Noah Harari&#x27;s book, \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\" highlights this:> A recent study commissioned by Google’s nemesis – Facebook – has indicated that already today the Facebook algorithm is a better judge of human personalities and dispositions than even people’s friends, parents and spouses. The study was conducted on 86,220 volunteers who have a Facebook account and who completed a hundred-item personality questionnaire.> The Facebook algorithm predicted the volunteers’ answers based on monitoring their Facebook Likes – which webpages, images and clips they tagged with the Like button. The more Likes, the more accurate the predictions. The algorithm’s predictions were compared with those of work colleagues, friends, family members and spouses.> Amazingly, the algorithm needed a set of only ten Likes in order to outperform the predictions of work colleagues. It needed seventy Likes to outperform friends, 150 Likes to outperform family members and 300 Likes to outperform spouses. In other words, if you happen to have clicked 300 Likes on your Facebook account, the Facebook algorithm can predict your opinions and desires better than your husband or wife! reply kentonv 14 hours agorootparentWe need Habeas Corpus for tech.

A link to Facebook settings, followed by a series of steps; these instructions say to log in to a non-Facebook url using your Facebook emailAll of these together was probably enough to hit some threshold.

In the context of a public-forum-esque discussion website it&#x27;s possible language that isn&#x27;t specific and actionable isn&#x27;t a death threat by the letter of the law. To spitball, a report of misbehavior that&#x27;s legally actionable in a place where it&#x27;s \"just\" a t.o.s. violation might get sent to the wrong support team, and then kicked back as possible report spam, by a busy reviewer who&#x27;s judged for their next pay raise by how well they kept the company they work for out of hot water with the local DA.

I am not in favor of saying a politician in a democracy should be murdered.

Carta is the Facebook of B2B software (i.e., hoover up user data then find lots of ways your users don’t expect to monetize it). Their business model has always been premised on a bait-and-switch. It’s how they’ve justified their crazy high valuations (e.g., “Imagine it we could create the largest market for private securities!! We’ll be rich!!!”). Otherwise, the market for cap table management just isn’t that big.As a founder you should maintain tight control of who is on your cap table. Carta disagrees. That may be good for them but is terrible for startups.

Maybe it&#x27;s bad for the founders, but there&#x27;s always a good chance these employees may not see a real liquidity event. reply FreakLegion 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s generally bad for the company as a whole. Liquidity erodes the 409A discount[1], which then makes other grants (either future or existing, one way or another) less valuable. This is a pretty classic case of local vs. global optima, like in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.If you&#x27;re interested in startups, I&#x27;d look for founders who 1) give you the maximum exercise window (10 years with ISO->NSO conversion if you leave), 2) offer early exercise, and 3) support coordinated secondaries where the folks who want it can get some liquidity, without mucking things up the way a free-for-all can.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sethlevine.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;whats-a-fair-409... reply ccorcos 4 hours agorootparentThe 409a discount is the problem here, honestly. Maybe we should lobby the government to change the laws. Because it sucks for employees that the Y Combinator stock option agreement template includes a non-transferability clause. It’s unfair that employees have don’t have the same access to liquidity that founders get. reply FreakLegion 23 minutes agorootparentEmployees should have the same access to liquidity that founders get, but that&#x27;s orthogonal to the 409A. The reason we want to keep the 409A low is so that when the company is valued at, say $100m, the common shares are much lower, say, $20m (even though they make up a majority of the company&#x27;s shares!). Now when we hire that amazing person and offer them 1% of the company, their options have a strike price of $200k but already an expected value of $1m+.Really the games we play with 409A valuations are a reason for founders to limit their own liquidity, too. Outside of a few famous examples like Google and Facebook, founders and employees have the same common shares, and it&#x27;s in both their interests to keep the common share price low while building the company. If founders are selling shares and not inviting employees to participate, it isn&#x27;t because of the 409A. Those founders are just assholes. reply enra 4 hours agorootparentprevThis one of main points too.We also do or plan to do these all 3 items.We haven’t done a coordinated secondary (tender offer) yet since our team is relatively small and people haven’t been with the company that long that there would be that many shares to offer.

Just drooling on the keyboard while aimlessly clicking in Salesforce and copy pasting emails in between meetings. reply enra 5 hours agoprevI&#x27;m OP on the tweet. To clarify on some points why I think this is wrong:Private companies generally don&#x27;t want or allow secondary transactions. Every good company wants to manage their cap table and who is on it. Every shareholder has some level of rights and sometimes you need their signatures on things. A problematic shareholder can cause a lot of problems that are time consuming to the company. Companies do offer secondary sales to employees and existing investors at times but those cases the buyers are vetted by the company. If anyone would want to sell the shares, I&#x27;m quite sure we would find buyers from the existing shareholders.So secondary sales to unknown buyers is potentially harmful for the company. Carta&#x27;s whole business has been to help private companies to manage their equity. Using their own employees to start soliciting these secondary sales is actively trying to harm the startup who is their customer.Carta also sits on this trove of confidential information about the company, the cap table, pricing, transactions etc. As a founder or company you trust them to manage this information and keep it confidential. Now it seems they are using this information to trying to build their order book on their secondary sales marketplace. They reached out to someone (a family member, whose investment is not public, who is not in tech&#x2F;didn&#x27;t opt in to this in any way). I believe only Carta knows is an investor in the company. The price the buyer was willing to buy was exactly our Series B price.The concern becomes what level of confidential information are exactly exposing here, who has access and how it&#x27;s used. In this case it seems that this person had access to our cap table in order to reach out the investor and buyer somehow was able to set their price exactly as our Series B price.I&#x27;m perfectly fine with the idea if Carta has secondary sales platform for a company approved tender offer or secondary sales. Even could be ok if buyers could submit their interest and Carta could inform the company about the interest.Where I think it crosses the line where Carta uses their employees to solicit these sales and (I believe) use private cap table information to reach out to the stakeholders to get them to sell knowing company or board hasn&#x27;t approved any secondary sales and doesn&#x27;t want to.Carta who is expert in startup equity, should know that most startups don&#x27;t want to see random secondary sales happening and usually they are not allowed. I know 3rd party platforms exists for this and you can go around the restrictions with forward contracts.To me it feels unethical practice from a vendor trying to actively harm us and using confidential information to do so.PS: Carta did reach out to me to schedule a call but didn&#x27;t provide any details yet.Update: I polled our investors and so far 3 people have said they got the same email. All of them were the earliest investors with most gains.

The issue here is the relationship with the company & Carta and overall corporate concerns, not much about employee equity.Briefly:- In a startup you&#x27;re granted options. Contract that allows you to buy certain amount of company shares at a specific price (”strike price”, also known as “exercise price”), which is usually the fair market price at the time when your options are granted. Options do not give you ownership of stock, instead they provide you rights to purchase stock at a favorable price.- Fair market price is the price of the stock based on the company’s current valuation (set by an outside evaluator). Early stage companies the fair market valuation 20-30% of the valuation investors pay.- Exercising your options means purchasing all or some of your shares and becoming a shareholder in the company. For example, if your strike price is $1.50 and you exercise your option for 1,000 shares, your exercise will cost $1,500 (1,000 x $1.50) plus any potential taxes, and you will be a holder of 1,000 shares. Now if in the future the company IPOs with a stock price of $100 you can sell those shares and get $100k or gain $98.5 per share.- Exercise window is the time you can buy your options. Commonly in US startups required you to purchase the shares within 90 days of you leaving the company or you lose it. More employee friendly startups have extended exercise windows that let you keep the options for 7 or 10 years.- Early exercise. Employee friendly startups allow early exercise for your options to avoid paying taxes along the way. Say you join the company when the strike price is $1.50. You exercise the shares at $1.50 now you own the shares and since there was no gain, you don&#x27;t have to pay taxes at that time. If you don&#x27;t early exercise then, but wait until the next funding round when the strike price is now $4.50, your now have to pay tax on the gain of $3. In both cases in the end if you one day sell the stock for $100 you still pay the same amount of taxes (gain from $1.50 to $100 or from $1.5 to $4.5 + $4.5 to $100). It just lets you to avoid taxes until you have actual liquidity and also lets you to pay long term gains, sometimes get it even tax free if your company and holding is QSBS eligible.Some guides that we share with our employees:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;swlh&#x2F;understanding-startup-stock-options-...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.holloway.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;equity-compensationhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.alexmaccaw.com&#x2F;an-engineers-guide-to-stock-opti...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wealthfront.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;equity-ipo-guide reply kdamica 8 hours agoprevDon’t most private companies require board approval for secondaries?

Before you read anything else, commit that date to memory. June 30th, 2024, will bring the End of Life (EOL) of CentOS Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) will be reaching End of Maintenance (EOM). The good news is that these events won’t require a complete infrastructure overhaul. Tools are available to move from your current configuration to a place where you’ll have years of support. While June of ‘24 may sound a ways off, do not delay. It will be here faster than you think. Start planning now. Start moving soon. Give yourself plenty of runway, and don’t forget that we aren’t just your software vendor at Red Hat. We are your partners and are here to help you with these transitions. If you’re like me when looking at a long-term, intensive project, some time is required to stare at a blank screen and process the task before me. Let me see if I can help drive you into action. The hard way In my days as a systems administrator, we didn’t consider in-place conversions or upgrades. For one thing, it wasn’t the straightforward process we have today. Secondly, new operating systems and hardware retirements went hand in hand. New OS? Time for a new server model! There are specific environments where that is the case. You can certainly buy new hardware (or spin up new cloud instances) on the latest versions of RHEL and do a “rip-and-replace,” moving over only your application data. But for many, this isn’t an ideal approach. What other options are there? If you want to keep your application on the same version and focus solely on the operating system for this project, you can do that too. Look at setting up a RHEL 8 or 9 server and running it as a container host for Podman. Put your applications into a container, and viola. You can build your applications into pre-built application images or Universal Base Images (UBI). However, this will require a fair amount of work as well. There is an easier way. In what amounts to a 2-phase process, we can convert your CentOS Linux systems onto a supported version of RHEL and then execute an in-place upgrade. Convert from CentOS Linux Pop Quiz: When does CentOS Linux 7.9 go EOL? If you said June 30th, 2024, then I can write the rest of this blog post feeling accomplished! Red Hat has created a way for users to move to a supported operating system in place using a supported process. Why in-place? Think of all the configurations, user home directories, processes and packages you already have running on these systems. An in-place upgrade means all that customization doesn’t go away. The other piece of good news is that the conversion process and the resulting server image are both supported by Red Hat! In other words, if something breaks during or after the conversion, you can open a support ticket and get the help you need. Now, we are looking at the final days of CentOS Linux. You’ve got hundreds (or even thousands) of servers running various minor releases of CentOS Linux 7. Let’s walk through what a conversion process looks like: The first thing to do, if you are running anything older than CentOS Linux 7.9, is to upgrade all of your packages to the latest minor release. Once you are running CentOS Linux 7.9 with all the packages on their latest available version, you can configure the convert2rhel repository. Run the conversion! Validate your applications and register your systems to Red Hat Insights. Brace yourself— we aren’t done just yet. If you want to get your hands dirty, we have a Convert2RHEL lab on our website to try for yourself! In-place upgrade Time for a review! When does RHEL 7 go EOM? If you said June 30th, 2024, you nailed it! Now, you should be looking at a fleet of systems running RHEL 7.9. Perhaps you already had a group of systems running earlier releases of RHEL 7. Now would be an excellent time to patch those to the latest available package set and the recently converted CentOS Linux systems. Much like CentOS Linux, RHEL 7 has limited life left. Red Hat does offer Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) subscriptions if that is a path of interest. However, these entitlements come with an added cost. For today’s thought exercise, we are looking at how to keep your systems feeling fresh (read supported) without added expense or the need to rip-and-replace later. Once the ‘yum’ command says there are no available packages left to update, your RHEL systems are ready to upgrade to the latest version of RHEL 8. Install the Leapp tools. Run the pre-upgrade assessment and remediate any identified issues. Run the in-place upgrade. Validate the upgraded systems and their applications. That is all there is to it! Sit back and take a deep breath. Even after June 2024, RHEL 8 will still have five years of maintenance support. If you’d like to try an in-place upgrade for yourself, we have a self-paced lab over on our website. Wrap up June 30th, 2024… Set a countdown on your phone. Put a reminder on your desktop. Grab a sticky note and put it on your mirror. Whatever you have to do. The date is rapidly approaching, and as a former sysadmin, I don’t want to see you having to scramble at the last minute to find ways to support your systems. June 30th, 2024… My experiences were always building a new server, with a new OS, on a new hardware platform. In the perfect world that exists only in my imagination, I might consider one last full-scale replacement and go straight to RHEL 9, then keep pace with the in-place upgrades for RHEL 10 and beyond. Sadly, technology, applications, industries and organizations don’t always march to that drum. Complex dependencies, processes and resource availabilities limit our ability to stay on the “latest and greatest.” If that is the position you find yourself in, follow the links in this blog, watch our videos and engage our Support and Services organizations. Red Hat is your partner in this.

I&#x27;m not sure what the process behind that was.CentOS was free, which is why we used it. Sure, our SAP boxes run RHEL but the other stuff doesn&#x27;t. We started moving a lot of stuff to Ubuntu as well.Now, Ubuntu is by no means perfect, snaps are annoying, etc. But Red Hat really angers me with their decisions during the last few years.One example is removing OpenLDAP:The openldap-servers package was removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. The openldap-clients package is still shipped though.If you use openldap-servers in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL7), you need to consider to change your LDAP server from OpenLDAP to Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL8).RHDS is provided as an add-on subscription in RHEL8, so you need buy the subscriptions in addition to RHEL subscription.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;access.redhat.com&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;3816971Additionally, Red Hat support is so bad these days.

They strictly want to take what Red Hat sells and rebuild and distribute it for free.The Alma people on the other hand view themselves as partners and contributors to Red Hat&#x27;s ecosystem. They want to make their product available for free, but they upstream as much as possible and add actual value to the ecosystem.If you don&#x27;t care about any of that, it&#x27;s still better to choose Alma IMHO because their approach (following the letter and spirit of \"the law\") is a lot more sustainable than Rocky&#x27;s exploit-the-system approach. reply tux1968 17 hours agorootparent> They strictly want to take what Red Hat sells and rebuild and distribute it for free.I think this is an unfair framing. Rather, they want to take all the GPL source code that Red Hat is obligated to make available, and distribute it freely. They believe this is in accordance with both the law and the software license that Red Hat agreed to, when using it as a basis for their business in the first place.Personally, I don&#x27;t have a dog in the fight, or a strong opinion on the matter. But we should at least fairly represent each parties position. reply dralley 16 hours agorootparentAll of the source code is already available, in CentOS Stream, from which RHEL is built in the first place.What they want to do, is do an exact rebuild of RHEL without having to go through the effort of putting the distribution together themselves, matching the versions that are used in a particular version of RHEL against what is available via CentOS Stream. reply skybrian 16 hours agorootparentAnd that&#x27;s perfectly fine under open source licenses.

Well actually, they don&#x27;t explicitly accuse Red Hat of unjustly locking down the source code, just that there are now some extra hurdles required to legally obtain it.They do contend, that they are exercising their legal rights as enumerated in the software license that Red Hat agreed to, when it started to use and freely redistribute the work of others.If you are denying they have this legal right, then I believe it&#x27;s on you to explain and justify this legal position, rather than just asserting it as fact. reply dralley 13 hours agorootparentWhat I am saying is that the code is not \"locked down\" in any meaningful sense, that it is already open source, and therefore that Rocky Linux isn&#x27;t \"freeing\" it. I&#x27;m not making any statement about their legal rights.As I commented elsewhere, \"RHEL\" isn&#x27;t GPL licensed, the kernel is, and glibc is, and systemd is, etc. Individually.The sources for all of those packages, individually, are available via CentOS Stream just as they ever were - alongside the sources for packages that aren&#x27;t GPL licensed, for which there is not actually a legal requirement to distribute sources.What Red Hat has stopped doing is providing a git repo containing the exact combination of package sources which collectively make up one particular version of RHEL. Instead, all of the sources are still available, but if you want to rebuild the entire distro you need to match up the particular versions with RHEL. And that&#x27;s exactly what Alma Linux does. reply tux1968 13 hours agorootparentOkay, so the source is 100% freely available. And with that source, and nothing else, you are able to regenerate RHEL binaries.Rocky Linux contends they are not doing anything illegal in the methods used to obtain the source code (ie. legally renting an RHEL VM from any number of providers, and downloading the SRPMS).Maybe Red Hat wishes this was illegal, but I still haven&#x27;t heard anyone claim that it is. reply dralley 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not claiming that either, so what&#x27;s your point.

Red Hat-compatible applications will still be able to run on AlmaLinux OS, and your installs of AlmaLinux will continue to receive timely security updates. The most remarkable potential impact of the change is that we will no longer be held to the line of “bug-for-bug compatibility” with Red Hat, and that means that we can now accept bug fixes outside of Red Hat’s release cycle. While that means some AlmaLinux OS users may encounter bugs that are not in Red Hat, we may also accept patches for bugs that have not yet been accepted upstream, or shipped downstream.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;almalinux.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;future-of-almalinux&#x2F; reply heywoodlh 17 hours agorootparentprevIncorrect, according to their FAQ[0] and the original article I linked[1]:> What does ABI&#x2F;binary compatible with RHEL mean?> In July of 2023, we announced (opens new window) that we were shifting our goal from being a downstream rebuild of RHEL to maintaining ABI compatibility with RHEL.

The sources are available as CentOS Stream -- from which RHEL is built in the first place!! It is true that, in order to put together an exact copy of RHEL, you would need to do a bit of work to figure out exactly what versions RHEL uses, and specifically pick those versions out of CentOS Stream. It isn&#x27;t as simple as downloading the entire tree of sources from a single git repository anymore. But that&#x27;s not the same as \"effectively closed source\", either. reply orthoxerox 13 hours agorootparentIf you provide GPL software to your customers, you have to provide everything they need to build this exact version yourself, not point them at a repo and tell them to figure it out. reply dralley 12 hours agorootparentRed Hat does provide all of that to RHEL customers. This is a discussion about what non-RHEL customers get.Even non-customers are provided with all of the sources they they could use to build RHEL, given some additional effort. It&#x27;s less trivial than it used to be, but not particularly difficult.Alma takes the approach of reconstructing RHEL using these public sources, Rocky takes the approach of buying AWS VMs running RHEL for a few minutes at a time so that they can download RHEL sources as a \"customer\" while only paying a few dollars a month to do so.The point is, even non-customers can rebuild RHEL using sources made publicly available by Red Hat if they so desire. It&#x27;s not \"effectively closed source\", even to them. reply josephcsible 12 hours agorootparentprevPrior to CentOS Stream, couldn&#x27;t you file the bug in the upstream project&#x27;s bug tracker instead, and then still do all of the other stuff you said? reply dralley 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;d still have to wait for someone at Red Hat to backport the fix themselves.

It would just be a matter of waiting, since RHEL only does releases every 6 months whereas Stream releases constantly.With CentOS you would have the same problem, except that there&#x27;s no way to make the engineering part happen any faster than Red Hat&#x27;s staffing and priorities allowed. replydoublepg23 17 hours agorootparentprevAccusing Red Hat of not contributing to the wider free software community is so off-base I’m not sure how to respond.Is there a single large FOSS project who’s git history isn’t filled with @redhat.com ? reply thesuperbigfrog 17 hours agorootparentOh, so is it okay to share RHEL sources back with the original project communities or not?If you share RHEL sources with the original project communities, what happens?>> Is there a single large FOSS project who’s git history isn’t filled with @redhat.com ?Does this give Red Hat the right to effectively \"close source\" the code for RHEL despite contributions from the rest of the community? reply dralley 17 hours agorootparentYes, you can. This is something everyone gets mixed up.RHEL is built from CentOS Stream sources. The changes Red Hat made to RHEL source distribution mostly just make it more challenging to reconstruct an entire build of RHEL from CentOS Stream - because you would have to map backwards from all of the different versions of sources available in CentOS Stream to the exact versions that a particular version of RHEL happens to use. But at the scale of any individual project, it&#x27;s trivial for any upstream community to just look at the latest CentOS Stream sources for one particular package, if they want to look at which patches Red Hat is applying. There are no legal or contractual restrictions on this whatsoever.This is setting aside the fact that most patches are backports from one upstream version to another, and bugfixes that get submitted \"upstream first\" to begin with, which makes the whole discussion kind of moot. The typical scenario for a net-new bugfix would be that a Red Hat employee submits the fix upstream and gets it reviewed and merged by said upstream months before it ever sees the light of day in RHEL, so upstream maintainers would never need to look at the RHEL sources in the first place. reply heywoodlh 17 hours agorootparentprev> Does this give Red Hat the right to effectively \"close source\" the code for RHEL despite contributions from the rest of the community?Legally, yes.

The longer you depend on them, they more they can charge you later. reply behnamoh 18 hours agoprevWell, Redhat has to make money somehow, so this decision is understandable.To me, open-source is about the open, transparent \"culture\" in which you commit to develop, not about putting things out there for free (as in free beer). Too many companies already benefiting from open-source packages (e.g., OpenCV) without giving anything back to the community. reply bogwog 17 hours agoparent> Well, Redhat has to make money somehow, so this decision is understandable.RedHat has been making money for decades. The Centos rug pull was just a way to make more money at the expense of their users and the larger open source community.It is impossible to justify a rug pull. By definition, it is a hostile, one-sided, trust-destroying, and underhanded move. reply Kaytaro 16 hours agorootparentApparently not an equivalent amount of money to the value they feel they’ve provided. And honestly given the communities response, I think they’re probably right. I mean if you think about it there’s no reason someone using Centos for a proper use case wouldn’t be fine moving to Centos Stream, unless they were getting some value out of Centos production-friendly releases. Vendor compatibility and LTS patches and updates take a big team to maintain, someone has to pay for that and I feel like many were just using Centos when really they should be using a supported enterprise distro. reply pksebben 17 hours agorootparentprevI found it notable that the linked RHEL post had zero mention of the why of it.

How many corporate environments the world over are running on Redhat, paid Redhat, because the engineers there came up in the Linux world learning free Redhat and were able to continue using CentOS at home or in their dev environments? That sort of cradle-to-grave brand identity with people who eventually become high-level decision-makers and money controllers is invaluable, but the value is also impossible to quantify, accountants never se it, and instead just see people trying to use all of their hard work for free.Yet somehow even Pablo Escobar understood this and threw away billions just giving money to poor people to keep cities on his side. I&#x27;m not even going to say IBM&#x27;s basic business model of making shit that works, doing at least some complex things reliably and well back when that was very difficult, is invalid. But it is fundamentally different to Redhat&#x27;s business model, which was simply cultivating a lifelong love of their product in the minds of its users. It&#x27;s like the Army acquiring the Red Cross. They work in a lot of the same places doing overlapping work and no doubt a lot of corporate synergy could be achieved and administrative overhead eliminated, but it would irreparably destroy a century and a half of goodwill and brand identity.

People believed that CentOS 8 would have 10 years of support because of what was done in the past, but that&#x27;s always subject to change.If, however, there were direct statements from Red Hat or CentOS that CentOS 8 would have 10 years of support and then they changed that - that&#x27;s moving the cheese for sure. reply mardifoufs 13 hours agorootparentI think you are right.

They also had this other feature called noisy disks 💾 and loud fans 🪭. Uh wait. Features? Why “features” and not “annoyances”?! Front panel of a common PC case in the late 1990s. My Pentium MMX 166 was hosted in one of these. You see, these bright lights and loud noises acted as canaries 🐦 in a performance mine. They gave developers a chance to notice when things were off performance-wise. If your code abused the CPU or the hard disk by mistake, you could tell right away. Nowadays, developer machines tend to be quiet under heavy load, and the vast majority of laptops don’t even have lights anymore. The obvious example are Macs: they haven’t had hard disk LEDs for a really long time, and since the M1, they are silent and cold too. These characteristics are nice from a usability perspective. Unfortunately, as a developer, you now need to first imagine that something is wrong before even deciding to look for a problem. If the thought never crosses your mind, then you may never look. Let me give you a few examples of the kinds of inefficiencies that I’m talking about. These would have been trivially noticed by the presence of indicators. These are all based on real-world situations I faced at some point in the (recent) past. 🪵 In a project I worked on, our development builds started writing about 80 MB of log messages per second to disk. No matter how you look at it, that’s a lot of disk traffic, and yet… the problematic code passed code review and was merged into the main branch. The only indication that something was wrong was when other developers came asking for help because their local disk space was running out faster than usual. There was no other symptom behind the problem. You’d hope that this inefficiency would be caught while qualifying the new release for production because, in theory, such logging waste would translate in an increase in CPU consumption or network bandwidth. But… I’m not so sure the issue would have been noticed. 🌐 In another project I worked on, I noticed that Bazel took an incredibly long time to complete some actions. It wasn’t until I looked in detail that I saw it stuck in a loop fetching the same remote artifact over and over again due to connection resets. The build completed successfully after many minutes once Bazel gave up on the downloads and fell back local execution. There was no reason to suspect that something was wrong other than “these actions are just huge”. In reality, though, there was a bug somewhere. 🧱 Just today, I was in a video call and noticed that my laptop was reading 100MB/s from disk non-stop. I concluded the meeting but the disk reads didn’t stop. A quick peek at top showed something called WallpaperVideoExtension that seemed to have gone rogue. This background process was consuming one full CPU, but such load wasn’t enough to make the system feel slower nor noisier. I suppose I would eventually have noticed that the battery was running out quicker than usual, but maybe not. Killing the process made the problem go away and the constant disk reads stopped. Looking online, I find other instances of WallpaperVideoExtension consuming lots of CPU and memory, so this seems to be a bug. But if it’s common, why wasn’t it noticed in the first place? In any case, this last scenario gives you a hint 🔍 as to where I’m going: how did I even notice this last problem? After all, my M1 Mac was working just fine: it was just slightly warmer than usual but there was no loud fan noise nor lights to tell me about disk activity. The answer is simple: I have an omnipresent performance monitor in my screen that shows CPU load, memory pressure, disk I/O throughput, and network traffic. This monitor is always visible, taking little space in the menu bar or the task bar. iStat Menus on the macOS menu bar, with the panel for CPU usage tracking open. Every time I sense something is a tiny bit off, I glance 👀 at the monitor. You cannot imagine how many times I’ve gone “huh, that’s interesting” by seeing unexpected activity and then went on to discover big performance problems somewhere in the system. My recommendation is that you stop what you are doing and go and install such a performance monitor right now. I’d even argue that having one always visible should be a hard requirement for any development machine and corp IT departments should preinstall one. Personally, I’m a huge fan of iStat Menus for macOS and have been using it for years. But if macOS is not your thing, you can find similar tools for other platforms like system-monitor-next for Gnome. Unfortunately, these monitors only help if you develop on your local machine—a workflow that’s becoming exceedingly rare. If, instead, you SSH into remote virtual machines to do your development or use VSCode’s remote features, you’ll need a different answer. This is a situation I face right now. The modern ThinkStation I have in the garage is well-equipped with useful lights… but I only access it over SSH for development so those lights and its disk noises are kinda useless from where I sit. And I’m not sure what the right answer here is. If you have been around for a while, you may remember GKrellM, which I was an avid user of. This system monitor had the ability to display remote machine activity and I’d love to have that again. Blog System/5 is a reader-supported publication.

When my computer started (or stopped) doing a bunch of things unexpectedly it was an indication of compromise or of an application gone rogue.These days, any number of people feel entitled to use our computers whenever they like for whatever they like. The company who makes your mouse driver might want to phone home, then silently download and install a bunch of software you never asked for. The maker of your OS sends themselves a steady stream of data about what you&#x27;ve been doing on your computer: which files you&#x27;ve had open recently, what software you have installed, etc. With countless people using our devices for their own benefit on their own schedules it&#x27;s nowhere near as useful to know when your computer is doing \"something\" because it&#x27;s always doing something.Personally, I&#x27;ve always preferred the soft whir of fans and the clicks of old hard drives. For a time they were a wonderful source of white noise for sleeping and I would sometimes find myself waking up if a computer I&#x27;d tasked with something overnight suddenly fell silent because it encountered a problem. I&#x27;d get up, fix the issue, and go back to sleep comforted by the sounds of my computer working away for me once more. Today our machines can be always silent while never being still, and they can spend at least as much time working for others as they do for us. Indications of activity can still be useful to me at times, but they&#x27;re never comforting the way they used to be. reply Zenst 8 hours agoparentLike the times of early dialup modems you could tell what was going on by the sound of modem, then came cable as things got faster. You would know your computer so well from that extra feedback from disc lights, noise of the disc head moving, and just a microsecond change in the noise on startup had you in investigation mode. Then things got faster and all those tactile feedbacks of knowing the health of your system got lost. Though in the early days, such feedback was the best AV you had.But as life moves on, and you get older, you start to appreciate the times as a child when your grandparents would reminisce the same things, and you would think old folks crazy as your baseline of life and technology is still being set at a fast pace, that eventually slows down. Until, you&#x27;re telling tales of whirring media and 5MB hard drives the size of a washing machine and costing more than a house at the time. Which is just crazy talk to kids today.That&#x27;s nostalgia, which is always a good positive comfort go to place as you get older. I&#x27;m equally somewhat reminded of the Star Trek TNG Episode - Relics when Scotty is in the holodeck simulating his Enterprise and tells Picard how he knew the Enterprise, his Enterprise and how fast it was going and the health of the engines by the feel and vibrations in the deck plate and none of that in the future he is on Picard&#x27;s Enterprise.

In other cases it may be more documented, such as Golangs baked-in telemetry.There should be better ways to check these problems. The best I have found so far is Crev https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crev-dev&#x2F;crev&#x2F;. It&#x27;s most used implementation is Cargo-crev https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crev-dev&#x2F;cargo-crev, but hopefully it will become more required to use these types of tools. Certainty and metrics about how many eyes have been on a particular script, and what expertise they have would be a huge win for software. reply mysql 13 hours agoprevTotally agree with this article, there are no immediate consequences to bad CPU bound code.

It was a long time ago, I rocked a Core2Quad at the time, but the motherboard had this issue that the audio in the headphones jacket would pickup both when the CPU was stressed (I guess due to power consumption) and additionally some mouse movement would also do small little noises - this forced me to use the keyboard more often, learned a lot of shortcuts at that time.I remember that computer wasn&#x27;t like this from the get go but started exhibiting this, after an year with it, I used it like this for at least three more years and then got a new one and the old one was converted to a media center. reply eviks 12 hours agoprevAwesome app indeed, well designed, and beats the hardware led indicators since it lists apps that are misbehaving (and not annoying like hdd noise) reply gbolcer 13 hours agoprevThey have LED cpu cooler displays now that you can stick anything you want on it including disk&#x2F;mem&#x2F;heat&#x2F;whatever.

Now you have to get an enthusiast&#x2F;sports car just to get oil pressure and voltage gauges, and even then they&#x27;re likely to be nerfed to non-linearity so they&#x27;re always in the same place until so far outside of normal that it&#x27;s too late to prevent any negative consequences.I&#x27;m looking at you, rental Turbo Passat coolant gauge that stayed perfectly still until overheating in Death Valley accompanied by an instantaneous jump from Normal to pinned in the red on the temperature gauge I was attentively monitoring. smh.Another example is the original MX-5&#x27;s oil pressure gauge that was so active you could use it as a proxy for engine RPM, which is normal.

Sure, they should be recorded as they are useful for troubleshooting and looking for bottlenecks. But relying on them for most software is trying to figure out if you should get a speeding ticket by looking at the tachometer.CPU usage being high doesn&#x27;t really tell you anything. You may suspect that there&#x27;s an issue if you are familiar with the system, and you have only one system to worry about. It&#x27;s definitely not OK if you have a &#x27;modern&#x27; architecture and a fleet of machines running a distributed system. There&#x27;s a whole lot of noise and you can&#x27;t tell if traffic has increased, if someone pushed inefficient code, if there&#x27;s a cooling problem and CPU is throttled, if a \"batch\" process started, or a million of reasons.And even if it is high, and it is an anomaly(anomaly detection on those metrics can be useful at times), is it causing any issues for your customers? CPU usage can&#x27;t tell you that.Every piece of software has some work to do. What is that work? Figure that out and monitor that. Golden signals on the relevant metrics and you&#x27;ll be in a far better position. Did the error rate increase? Are we getting higher response times? In that case it doesn&#x27;t matter what the CPU metric says – it could even be lower than usual if there&#x27;s a bottleneck somewhere else – it is a problem that needs to be addressed. You can then use the other metrics to confirm, or try to isolate the problem. But they should be supporting information, not your main diagnostics tool.> In a project I worked on, our development builds started writing about 80 MB of log messages per second to disk.Well, there you go. If you just look at disk I&#x2F;O you&#x27;ll see that it is high. But if you track metrics from your logging system, you&#x27;ll be able to immediately see _why_Datadog (no affiliation here) has a good blog that set me on the right track: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datadoghq.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;monitoring-101-collecting-dat...By all means monitor those metrics on your work laptop - very few people are going to bother running prometheus in their dev machine and setting up alerts for third party apps.

I did not expect that result at all and am in no way a professional when it comes to LLM's or computer science in general, just a guy that likes to nerd about and tinker around. For those wondering how I achieved this, the answer is that I simply attempted to apply the techniques outlined in this amazing article myself: https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tune-a-mistral-7b-model-with-direct-preference-optimization-708042745aac Therefore, all credit basically goes to the guy who wrote that.

I used the same dataset and reformatted it to apply the ChatML template. The code to train this model is available on Google Colab and GitHub.

My observations below.Mixtral does about average at summarization. Not enough details are presented in the summary. Passable for non-decisionbound workflows. Using quantized models injects occasional spelling errors, so fall back on Mistral unquantized. Skip all the Mistral finetunes. Only choose Instruct models.There are no good local code comprehension&#x2F;generation models (and that includes CodeLlama, DeepSeek, Starcoder, WizardCoder, Phind). You will spend as much time guiding&#x2F;rerolling&#x2F;correcting output as coding it yourself, assuming your task is nontrivial and exceeds 100+ LoC. Code completion via continue.dev using local models did not yield good results, either.No local models are good at agentic tasks (e.g., via AutoGen). You might have better luck rolling your own with function-calling via NexusRaven2 than using Agent frameworks with local LLMs.Claude-Instant edges out gpt-3.5-turbo for longform summarization with its 100k context.

What do people do there that you think could be applied elsewhere? For Iceland, I believe I said something about people's contact with nature. Just about every Icelandic person has been on a hike, and they all seem to have a level of admiration and care for nature that's not as widespread elsewhere. But in light of the most recent volcanic eruption, I got to thinking about something else. There's a saying in Icelandic - þetta reddast - that means \"everything will be alright\", and, while many languages have a similar expression, this one is really embedded in Icelandic culture. I remember the first time I felt an earthquake in my life, back when I lived there. I was reasonably worried, and started remembering things I'd seen as a child. \"Should we get under a table?\" — I asked my Icelandic girlfriend at the time. She didn't seem too phased, and before she had a chance to answer, the quake stopped. \"Well, I guess it's all good now\". There was also the time when I was convinced to “walk up” (turns out it was actually climb up) one of the ice pinnacles atop of Snaefellsjökull. At the time I had no experience with crampons or an ice axe at all, yet the group of also amateurs from my ex-girlfriend's company were all pretty chill about the situation and pitched it as a seemingly easy thing. Snaefellsjökull, 2022. On the way up there, quite a few of the people got scared, and I for one nearly lost my oversized crampon, which came off my foot and caused me to slide down this steep ice slope that led straight into a crevasse at the bottom. I managed to stop myself with an ice axe self-arrest, saved by having used my free time in the past to watch alpinism videos with self-arrest tutorials. The thing is that living in Iceland requires a unique type of mentality, even if the Icelanders themselves don't necessarily think about it much. Subscribe To live essentially on top of a volcano or with a massive volcano nearby requires a mix of belief that everything will be okay, but also determination and preparedness to make it be so. And in some ways you almost need to just to be willing to start over. Before I lived there, the first time I visited Iceland I stayed in this farmer's cabin in the South, and he told us about how despite him being okay and his house staying up, he lost all of his sheep due to the ash from the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption. If you don't believe everything will be alright in the end - how do you keep going? Yet despite the expression seemingly tossing the responsibility of making things good up to fate, it's also your responsibility to make it alright. I was once told Icelandic consultants are particularly wanted during crises. They operate well in the post-catastrophe chaos, bringing both a necessary optimism and also an ability to prioritize and stay rational. Me with Fagradalsfjall (maybe too close) in the back. The Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021, which happened while I was still living there, marked the end of around 800 years of no volcanic activity in the Reykjanes peninsula, an area of significant economic importance that's also dangerously close to where the vast majority of Icelanders live - the Reykjavík capital region. But having some of the world's best geologists and volcanologists in the world, a well-trained Search & Rescue team, and a conscious population means Iceland feels ready to deal with this, and that everything will be okay. You see this from how fast Grindavík, a town potentially in danger, was evacuated ahead of this 2023 eruption, an event somewhat analogous to the heroic effort of the Heimaey evacuation in 1973, where an entire island was evacuated in just a few hours after the alarm sounded for a surprise eruption. Plus they also managed to save the harbor, by pumping seawater and spraying it into the lava to redirect it. I say all this to say that Icelanders are possibly better prepared than most of us to deal with life. Because the Icelandic antifragility built up from generations of living in an island that seems to not want you there should not be mistaken as something applicable only in their little island. It has made Icelanders well-prepared to deal with an inevitable part of all of our lives — crisis. By contrast, Brazilians love to mention how we have no natural disasters. We don't get earthquakes, have no active volcanoes, no hurricanes, nothing. Yet every year thousands of homes are lost, people die, and infrastructure is damaged just from the repercussions of the comparatively predictable rainy season. I'm sure that both for our country, but also our personal lives, we have a lot to learn. Because in my experience, despite its inherent optimism, þetta reddast often doesn’t imply “it’ll be taken care of”, but rather “we’ll take care of it”.

It&#x27;s a trade off with pros and cons and works for some situations and inhibits progress in other situations, things often don&#x27;t get acted on or resolved quickly but at the same time there is a huge reservoir of tolerance to draw on when things do get shit.I would consider this the other end of the spectrum to countries like Japan or Germany in the way they respond to certain things. Lots of generalisations of course but that&#x27;s often the impressions you get from travelling. It&#x27;s very hard to be precise about big groups of people. reply switch007 17 hours agoparentGive me German&#x2F;Dutch \"this is awful and it should be fixed\" any day over \"It&#x27;ll be grand\" (we have a similar attitude here just across the Irish sea)It can be a bit annoying listen to them moan about small things constantly but my impression of the Netherlands is shit just works and things get fixed. They seem to have a very low tolerance for bs and excuses, which is refreshing reply nicbou 49 minutes agorootparentIn my experience this is not how Germany works at all. \"This is how we&#x27;ve always done it\" is a lot closer to reality. Germans have an incredibly low standard for efficiency.

The things Obama still get blamed at is insane. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Obama, Trump, or Biden.

People tolerate breakage on a small and large scale, to a bigger extent than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else. Anything from permanent shop signs with spelling mistakes, to letting people rent out unsanitary housing, to \"ghost buses\" which show up in their IT systems as planned, then as running, and then, when they are about to show up, simply disappear off of their systems as if it was never planned in the first place.

The Netherlands is currently experiencing minor flooding, and a dike failure in Maastricht led to a dozen house boats needing to be evacuated.> see what happens come morningThere really isn&#x27;t anything else you can do. Natural disasters are unpredictable, and the situation can drastically change from hour to hour. When your country is prone to this kind of threat, it&#x27;ll have dozens of scenarios worked out, planned, and practiced. It&#x27;s mostly a matter of grabbing the right playbook, working like hell, and hoping it doesn&#x27;t get worse. If it does get worse, you simply grab the next playbook and carry on. reply ethbr1 18 hours agoparentprev> Folks who live under routine threat like volcanism can be the most calm and functional during crises.Mind the (tectonic) gap. reply foobarbecue 19 hours agoprevFirst two paragraphs resonated. I&#x27;m an American who grew up in Brazil, Japan, and Sweden. I&#x27;m tired of being asked \"which was your favorite\" because it&#x27;s so reductive and ALWAYS what people ask me. Questions in this article are much better.On the other hand, the description of roping up without proper training... yeesh. Sounds like bunch of gumbies putting each other&#x27;s lives in danger. Not ok. reply ekidd 14 hours agoparent> Sounds like bunch of gumbies putting each other&#x27;s lives in danger. Not ok.One weird thing about Iceland (as of 2008) that might be related: They don&#x27;t do warning signs.- Superheated geyser pool 3 feet from the foot path? No warning sign 95% of the time. The other 5%? \"Danger: Hot.\"- A slippery tourist trail 5 feet from a rushing river that immediately goes over an 80 foot waterfall? No warning sign. Often no railing, either.- A road to a tourist attraction that might rip your transmission out? No warning sign.I could give more examples of unmarked deadly hazards at major tourist attractions.Iceland appears to assume that deadly hazards are common, and that you&#x27;ll use common sense. Or maybe you won&#x27;t, and you&#x27;ll stick your hand in a geyser.I&#x27;m reluctant to draw any kind of philosophical point here, besides \"When visiting Iceland, please use common sense and pay attention to your surroundings.\" reply tome 17 hours agoparentprevHow about in future, when someone asks you \"which was your favorite\" you instead answer one of the questions in the article? It&#x27;s highly unlikely people literally want to know which was your favourite. More likely they&#x27;re open to hearing anything interesting about your experience you could share. reply switchbak 16 hours agoparentprev\"Sounds like bunch of gumbies putting each other&#x27;s lives in danger\" - that seemed pretty obvious from his story.I have a couple good friends that work on the search and rescue team, and the increasing number of stories about people putting themselves in serious danger with no self awareness is really concerning. I&#x27;ve unwittingly been pulled into these situations myself with said gumbies, and I&#x27;m now at the stage where I have no tolerance of it.It&#x27;s really not cool to put a bunch of other folks in danger because you did something stupid, completely ignorant of any potential danger. It&#x27;s totally ok to take measured risks, with proper training&#x2F;knowledge and at least some kind of preparation for handling unexpected situations.And sometimes it&#x27;s me being the gumby, which probably still happens in small doses :) reply moffkalast 17 hours agoparentprevSo... which one was your favorite? :P reply RobRivera 14 hours agorootparentOh youuuuuu reply bbarn 19 hours agoprevI lived in Iceland for several years recently. One thing you have to keep in mind, is this philosophy is pretty much born out of necessity. Until the US Military built a base in Keflavík (which later became an international airport), the country was quite behind the times. As one friend put it to me \"When you were landing on the moon we were getting running water installed\"Iceland was a very poor country for most people other than a few well off in the fishing industry. Today it&#x27;s still relatively \"medium\" with few people very wealthy, but also almost no one in destitution. The attitude is that everyone should be able to live a good life, and while it&#x27;s not truly socialist, it&#x27;s pretty darn close.Þetta reddast is used somewhat interchangeably with \"I don&#x27;t feel like dealing with this\" and \"Some how things will work out even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it now\" and \"fuck it\". To most people it&#x27;s kind of an in joke you say when something really sucks. reply bane 19 hours agoparentWe just spent some time in Iceland this past year. I hadn&#x27;t really realized it but Iceland pretty much didn&#x27;t even have a formal tourist industry until sometime in the early 2000s mostly due to volcanic eruptions disrupting transatlantic air traffic causing the country to end up on the news.I came away with some interesting things:- In one small town we visited they had turned the local town hall into a tourist greeting center. It had a theater that showed films from the 60s and 70s filmed near that town. One of them explained that there were no roads to the town until the modern period. However the town&#x27;s main industry was sheep farming. How did they get the sheep to market in the larger towns? Simple, they flow in an aircraft, drove the sheep onboard, and flew them there! Before the airplane people either didn&#x27;t live there or had to drive their sheep by foot or boat to market -- trips of many many days.- Icelanders are incredibly comfortable being constantly very near volcanism. Most village centers have a local bathhouse fed by hot water from hot springs and they&#x27;re very popular social centers, people live on the slopes of active volcanoes, the air often smells of volcanic gases in many places in the country, and so on.- Much of the landscape is virtually impassable. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve really ever seen such a vegetatively sparse landscape that was so inaccessible simply due to the terrain.

And at least Iceland had a program in place to build a Scandinavian-style welfare state so everyone really would get that running water pretty quickly, as well as healthcare and education and the rest. America is still struggling with that while again spending tens of billions on a microwaved-Apollo-cum-Artemis program that’s mostly pork distribution for senators. reply somenameforme 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s extremely and utterly odd, to me, that so many people single out things like the Apollo Program as an &#x27;extravagance&#x27; when this was also the era of the Vietnam War. The entire Apollo program cost $178 billion in 2022 dollars. The Vietnam War cost more than $1 trillion, and that&#x27;s if you put a $0 price tag on the millions of people killed, to say nothing of decades more of people being maimed and killed by our cluster bomblets left all over the country.The Vietnam War had absolutely 0 value. We hyped it up as some do-or-die necessity, we invaded, participated in the killing of millions of people, blew a trillion dollars, lost the war, went home, and there was no grand catastrophic change. We could have just skipped to the end by not getting involved in the first place. By contrast one can argue about the exact value of the Apollo Program but it&#x27;s absolutely undeniable that there was value. We learned a bunch, showed what&#x27;s possible with human ingenuity, and just plain old did something that would make one proud to be a human, let alone an American at the time. If we did more things like this, it&#x27;s very likely that the relationship between the people and the government would be far better than it is today. reply gota 14 hours agorootparent> say nothing of decades more of people being maimed and killed by our cluster bomblets left all over the country.Not to mention the millions of people devastated by Agent Orange.The fact that the specialists warned the US military of these effects and it didn&#x27;t stop them from poisoning the population for generations is mind boggling. How did these people rationalize their actions?Anyway - there&#x27;s no possible price tag for that. Your point of comparison is correct; the space race as a whole was about the best- and cheapest-case scenario for a \"war\" reply awongh 11 hours agorootparentprevI agree, and.... One reason why Apollo might seem cheap is because a lot of the R&D dollars are counted against developing ICBM missiles to annihilate everyone on earth. The rockets themselves and the fundamental work was primarily motivated by the creation of weapons, space exploration second. reply ebiester 13 hours agorootparentprevLeftists and black activists were also against the Vietnam War.The arguments were far less about the monetary value in that case, though. reply philwelch 11 hours agorootparentprevIn the aftermath of the fall of South Vietnam, somewhere between 200,000 and 400,000 refugees died at sea trying to flee the country. Cambodia also fell to communism, where the new regime murdered between 1.5 million and 2 million of its people. Actually winning the Vietnam War could have prevented these outcomes and left Southeast Asia in a much more stable and prosperous position today, similar to South Korea. reply ozborn 10 hours agorootparentIt was communist controlled Vietnam which got rid of the Khmer Rouge about 45 years ago ending the genocide in Cambodia, it&#x27;s entirely unclear what your hypothetical \"winning\" South Vietnamese government would have done. The US government was still mad enough with Vietnam that it applied more sanctions on Vietnam after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and the other major player (China) supported the Khmer Rouge and invaded Vietnam in retaliation. reply philwelch 10 hours agorootparentThe United States and South Vietnam both opposed the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian Civil War while the North Vietnamese supported them. The split between the Vietnamese communists and the Khmer Rouge only happened after the US allowed both South Vietnam and the previous Cambodian government to fall to communists. reply ch4s3 19 hours agorootparentprev> a symbol of misplaced priorities at the timeThis always feels terribly myopic to me. There&#x27;s a lot of state capacity and doing a sing;e time bound endeavor did not prevent civil rights legislation from passing or economic development in Mississippi.

Probably Apollo would have been received differently by many people if other, more humane areas had seen as enthusiastic spending. Not saying it was wrong to do Apollo, though! It was important, another great outcome was that it made the Soviet system crack faster.It was also not clear from originally that Apollo would be single time limited project, in the beginning there was a lot of talk about moon bases and such. reply philwelch 16 hours agorootparentThere were a lot of enthusiastic spending programs and civil rights reforms in the 1960’s, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965, Civil Rights Act of 1968 (which included the Fair Housing Act), the establishment of Medicare, Medicaid, federal funding for elementary and secondary schools, Job Corps, Head Start, expansion of Social Security benefits, the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities, the Public Broadcasting System and National Public Radio, the Department of Transportation (along with federal funding for mass transit and high speed rail), the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, and food stamps, just to name the highlights. reply wolverine876 10 hours agorootparentWhat is your point?

There was plenty of opposition. reply philwelch 10 hours agorootparentTry reading the comment I was responding to for context.

And I responded by listing all of the humane spending programs that had been enacted in that period, ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to Social Security expansion to new funding programs for education, food stamps, transportation, and other such things.In reality the administration of Lyndon Johnson was the second greatest expansion of the American federal welfare state in history (after the New Deal); it&#x27;s simply not true to claim that the federal government during that period lacked \"enthusiasm\" for such things. reply wolverine876 6 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right that I didn&#x27;t look at the other comments.

Eventually, US lost heart and fled the country.

The decrease in value per krona in ten years starting 1980 was something like 99.7%, so the loans went pretty quickly to something indistinguishable from zero. Inflation-indexed loans have been the only type of housing loan you could get for most of the time since about 1981, and are still the norm. The effect around that time of transition was that the younger generations (next waves of house buyers after them) were saddled with a lot of the burden.Source: I&#x27;m Icelandic. reply ranting-moth 19 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure I heard something like \"nennessekki\" a few times when things where getting tense. reply jtha 18 hours agorootparentThat would be the infamous Icelandic verb of \"nenna\".

In some ways a better translation would be \"I can&#x27;t be bothered to\".The word is somewhat socially acceptable as an excuse not to do something.\"Þetta reddast\" and \"Ég nenni þessu ekki\" are words many of us Icelanders live by. reply meheleventyone 18 hours agorootparentprevProbs something like ‘nei, nei, ekki’ which means ‘no, no, don’t’. reply WarOnPrivacy 16 hours agoparentprev> \"When you were landing on the moon we were getting running water installed\"Same for a number of folks in Fairfax Co VA (US ~wealthiest).

I worked at an Icelandic company for many years and some of my coworkers are like family - I never quite put my finger on why I got so well with Icelandic people, but maybe it&#x27;s because of this \"þetta reddast\" attitude - I also have this attitude, though it was something I got in my mid-20s - I used to always think the sky was falling and at some point I realized that it consistently stayed up. reply 0xEF 12 hours agoparent> it was something I got in my mid-20sI&#x27;m past my prime, but would love to know your secret. I remember not wanting to return from Iceland, dreading the inevitable Anxiety Circus™ that was my life in the US. While in Iceland, I felt good about being alive. The way the people just get to the point and aren&#x27;t afraid to say what they mean instead of this weird communication dance most Americans seem to do. The fact that yeah, danger looms in a variety of ways and the environment can be a bit hostile, but that&#x27;s fine because we can deal with it together. It is difficult for me to call my experience there anything but refreshing...and yet I was not able to hang on to that.A fault of my own, to be sure, but seeing as you adopted it in your early years, was there anything in particular that you did to make that happen? reply klik99 4 hours agorootparentSince you asked, but I dunno if this is applicable...I had a lot of anxiety growing up - from \"If I fail this test then everything is downhill\" in school to \"If I miss this payment then everything is downhill\" in the scare quotes \"real world\". I remember listing out on paper every time I could remember that I thought there would be dire consequences if I failed and there wasn&#x27;t actually dire consequences. Maybe it was a kind of retrospective cognitive behavioural therapy? I noticed a pattern (though I didn&#x27;t have the understanding to call it a pattern back then).But that was the moment that something switched and I had the confidence that even if shit hit the fan I would make it through. Probably it was the culmination of other realizations and not just this act by itself, but that was def the crystallization. And not that I&#x27;m always this way, but it&#x27;s rare for me to fall back into the anxiety circus. It still takes some practice to maintain it in particularly tough situations.Maybe you associate that state of mind with a place because you felt it most strongly there?

Author here. Felt this one in particular needed a reply.I&#x27;ve since actually gotten a bit into alpinism and done a proper course. My instructor (a super experienced British guy in the Alps) refused to teach self-arrests to beginners because he said the risks were greater than the potential benefits. He said a lot of people get hurt practicing it (as you&#x27;ve noted) and so he preferred to really drill down on precautions and crevasse rescue techniques etc.As for the story, I need to note the slope wasn&#x27;t too steep, but being unable to brake would maybe have sent me down the crevasse (unclear how wide it was, we stepped over it on the way there and it seemed it may have been narrow). I also doubt my technique was perfect, but I just remembered to not just try to have the axe over my head somewhere but rather push my body&#x2F;shoulder into it with the axe placed more diagonally.I&#x27;m certain it was not beautiful nor perfect but at least enough in that situation. reply AlbertCory 16 hours agorootparentIn our case, it was in the San Gabriel mountains near LA.

I took the summer route which was 100m away, just because it was smoother. It was wet grass and some patches of snow. I slipped, fell on my back and started sliding, had trouble turning because of my backpack. You really catch speed, I couldn&#x27;t stop, I was approaching rocks.

Installing Harlequin After installing Python 3.8 or above, install Harlequin using pip or pipx with: pipx install harlequin Using Harlequin with DuckDB From any shell, to open one or more DuckDB database files: harlequin \"path/to/duck.db\" \"another_duck.db\" To open an in-memory DuckDB session, run Harlequin with no arguments: harlequin If you want to control the version of DuckDB that Harlequin uses, see the Troubleshooting page. Using Harlequin with SQLite and Other Adapters Harlequin also ships with a SQLite3 adapter. You can open one or more SQLite database files with: harlequin -a sqlite \"path/to/sqlite.db\" \"another_sqlite.db\" Like DuckDB, you can also open an in-memory database by omitting the paths: harlequin -a sqlite Other adapters can be installed using pip installor pipx inject harlequin , depending on how you installed Harlequin. For a list of known adapters provided either by the Harlequin maintainers or the broader community, see the adapters page in the docs. Getting Help To view all command-line options for Harlequin and all installed adapters, after installation, simply type: harlequin --help To view a list of all key bindings (keyboard shortcuts) within the app, press F1.

Contributing Thanks for your interest in Harlequin! Harlequin is primarily maintained by Ted Conbeer, but he welcomes all contributions and is looking for additional maintainers! Providing Feedback We'd love to hear from you! Open an Issue to request new features, report bugs, or say hello. Setting up Your Dev Environment and Running Tests Install Poetry v1.2 or higher if you don't have it already. You may also need or want pyenv, make, and gcc. Fork this repo, and then clone the fork into a directory (let's call it harlequin), then cd harlequin. Use poetry install --sync to install the project (editable) and its dependencies (including all test and dev dependencies) into a new virtual env. Use poetry shell to spawn a subshell. Type make to run all tests and linters, or run pytest, black ., ruff . --fix, and mypy individually. Opening PRs PRs should be motivated by an open issue. If there isn't already an issue describing the feature or bug, open one. Do this before you write code, so you don't waste time on something that won't get merged. Ideally new features and bug fixes would be tested, to prevent future regressions. Textual provides a test harness that we use to test features of Harlequin. You can find some examples in the tests directory of this project. Please include a test in your PR, but if you can't figure it out, open a PR to ask for help. Open a PR from your fork to the main branch of tconbeer/harlequin. In the PR description, link to the open issue, and then write a few sentences about why you wrote the code you did: explain your design, etc. Ted may ask you to make changes, or he may make them for you. Don't take this the wrong way -- he values your contributions, but he knows this isn't your job, either, so if it's faster for him, he may push a commit to your branch or create a new branch from your commits.",

It&#x27;s the most barebones unix thing you can imagine. If you understand unix principles, you can use virtual environments and python.It used to be hard. A global site-packages or dist-packages dir is hard. Conda and all those tools make it worse.A virtualenv is a directory. It contains a copy of Python and everything needed.You don&#x27;t even need to activate it. You can simply use the binaries that exist in those directories.It&#x27;s literally this simple: $ python -m venv pmarreck $ pmarreck&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python --version Python 3.10.12 $ pmarreck&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pip install harlequin Collecting harlequin Downloading harlequin-1.8.0-py3-none-any.whl (61 kB) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 61.5&#x2F;61.5 kB 1.2 MB&#x2F;s eta 0:00:00 ...

What about `requirements.txt` projects? reply nerdponx 12 hours agorootparentIt works for installing dependencies from Pip, so yes, unless that Python project is doing something bizarre that it shouldn&#x27;t be doing.It&#x27;s functionally identical to node_modules or Ruby Bundler or Perl local::lib.It&#x27;s so weird to me that people continue to hate Python for a problem that literally every programming language has had since shared libraries were invented. reply whalesalad 12 hours agorootparentprevrequirements.txt is just a list of packages for pip. It doesn&#x27;t even need to be called requirements.txt, it could be called poopoopeepee.txt. That name is just a convention.You could do `for line in requirements.txt, pip install `. They are ostensibly the same. It is not a magical lockfile. It is unix. It is just a list if packages. If you are in a virtualenv, you will be fine.either activate the venv, source venv_directory&#x2F;bin&#x2F;activate pip install -r requirements.txtor, skip the convenience and use the binary directly: venv_directory&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pip install -r requirements.txtvirtualenv activation just sets the $PATH to refer to those binaries. you can use them directly.the production deployment for my core python app lives in &#x2F;srv&#x2F;app, the venv lives in &#x2F;srv&#x2F;venvTo update packages on the system, it is as simple as cd &#x2F;srv&#x2F;app &#x2F;srv&#x2F;venv&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pip install -r requirements.txtThen to invoke this with the correct runtime, it is as easy as &#x2F;srv&#x2F;venv&#x2F;bin&#x2F;gunicorn ...In this example I am running the gunicorn application server. This is running the specific gunicorn version installed into my virtualenv.The name `&#x2F;srv&#x2F;venv` is my decision. You can call that whatever you want and put it wherever you want. For instance, if you have two projects called application-foo and application-bar, you can have the following: &#x2F;srv&#x2F;application-foo&#x2F;app - the codebase (ie, the github repo) &#x2F;srv&#x2F;application-foo&#x2F;venv - the corresponding virtualenv &#x2F;srv&#x2F;application-bar&#x2F;app &#x2F;srv&#x2F;application-bar&#x2F;venvSome people will even put their venv dir inside of their source tree and exclude it from git (add to .gitignore), but I do not like this approach because my deployments destroy the app dir and unzip the build into that location on each deploy.I cannot speak for every python-based project (distinction from pip package) out there. A lot of people do not know what they are doing, open source is literally all the rope to hang yourself with. Anything is possible, and people without engineering experience will glue things together without understanding how they work.If you are installing something via pip, then yes, you can create N virtualenvs and use them however you want. They are 100% isolated environments.If you are using homebrew, apt-get, dnf&#x2F;yum, arch etc... then those are going to obviously vary from distro to distro and that is outside the scope of this discussion.I try to stick to Python&#x27;s native tools as much as possible. Using a distribution package is going to cause issues, for sure. IE, don&#x27;t install `apt-get install python-pil`, use a virtual environment and `pip install PIL` reply pmarreck 12 hours agorootparentalright, I will bookmark this and try this next time I want to play with a python project.OK, how would I include all of these under the same PATH regime?So for example say I want to run this project from a commandline location elsewhere... I&#x27;d only be able to have one venv activated at the same time in the same session, right?I guess that&#x27;s part of my issue with this. I want to be able to access 10 different Python projects&#x27; commands from the same command line at any time. reply whalesalad 12 hours agorootparentTo access 10 different commands at the same time, that is tricky but definitely doable.First thing that comes to mind, you can use aliases.To keep it simple, lets use 3 examples instead of 10: harlequin (this project), pgcli (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgcli.com&#x2F;) and httpx (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python-httpx.org&#x2F;)Setup a main home for all your venvs: cd ~ mkdir venvsGo into this dir, and create your venvs and install the packages cd venvs python -m venv harlequin ~&#x2F;venvs&#x2F;harlequin&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pip install harlequinNow this binary is available at $ ~&#x2F;venvs&#x2F;harlequin&#x2F;bin&#x2F;harlequinRepeat for the rest cd ~&#x2F;venvs python -m venv pgcli ~&#x2F;venvs&#x2F;pgcli&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pip install pgcli cd ~&#x2F;venvs python -m venv httpx ~&#x2F;venvs&#x2F;pgcli&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pip install httpxWash, rinse, repeat. Now you have all these binaries available and can alias them alias harlequin=\"~&#x2F;venvs&#x2F;harlequin&#x2F;bin&#x2F;harlequin\" alias pgcli=\"~&#x2F;venvs&#x2F;pgcli&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pgcli\" alias httpx=\"~&#x2F;venvs&#x2F;httpx&#x2F;bin&#x2F;httpx\"This is a pain in the ass though and usually simple CLI tools like this do not collide with each other. So that is why I say install globally, or install into your \"global junk drawer\" virtualenv.Meanwhile, for actual projects that you are developing on, those would have their own isolated venv.I have a junk drawer venv where I install tools like this. If something goes wrong, it is as simple as rm -rf the venv and make a new one. And then I have isolated ones for each of the actual systems I maintain. Again, I use pyenv for this to make it a little easier to manage in conjunction with their specific python versions such that I do not ever interact with my distribution&#x27;s Python. This is cross platform so it works across mac, linux etc. Very easy workflow, isolated, safe, can get blown away and recreated in a heartbeat. reply gottoupvote 3 hours agorootparentSounds like something https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;stow&#x2F; could help with. replynerdponx 12 hours agorootparentprevYour Tweet shows that you don&#x27;t actually know what these tools do. There&#x27;s not much overlap in functionality between Pyenv, Tox, and Poetry, for example.Also, nobody active in the Python community will argue that there&#x27;s 1 correct way to do packaging. That&#x27;s a serious straw man.Fortunately, none of those tools you mentioned other than venv are actually required to run Python applications, and there are in fact exactly 2 recommended ways to install Python applications:1) Use your system&#x27;s package manager2) Use a venv, either manually (as shown in the sibling comment) or using the Pipx tool, which just creates venvs for you.All of the other tools you mentioned (except for Pyenv) represent ~20 years of active development and iteration on how to manage projects and build packages for distribution, and end-users shouldn&#x27;t even have to be aware of their existence. And Pyenv is just Rbenv but for Python.As I&#x27;ve pointed out elsewhere, this is exactly the same situation as with literally every other programming language that doesn&#x27;t generate standalone executables, and is even a problem with those that do, if they rely on dynamic linking. The special ire towards Python in this case is neither warranted nor valid.Your pinned post on Twitter is predicated on double standards and lack of basic understanding of the tools you&#x27;re criticizing. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good way to represent oneself. reply calvinmorrison 12 hours agorootparentprev> every project you have should be in a virtual environmentIt&#x27;s like ye-olden days.

The important thing is that editing plain text works perfectly well in a terminal, whereas you need a modern GUI for most other business-related software.I switched to emacs during the pandemic because of Zoom and Slack (along with my horrible browser habits). VSCode is pretty reasonable on resources compared to many Electron apps, and I slightly prefer it to emacs in terms of overall experience. But emacs is also good, and there were just too many Zoom calls where my computer ran out of memory, with VSCode having a glaringly high footprint. I think at the time its terminal emulator was either excessively inefficient, or it had a specific resource leak. So maybe things have gotten better, but I&#x27;ve stuck with emacs regardless.These days I can let a few dozen unread tabs in Firefox fill in the extra ~1GB of memory VSCode was formerly occupying :) reply dragonelite 12 hours agoparentprevI like TUI because it usually works nicely with multiplexer like zellij or tmux.

However, I mostly use the command line client that comes with SQLite, not because of how many features it has (not a lot) but because I use Bash and everything that comes with it, across various sessions managed with Tmux, as part of what I do with SQLite. It’s the same reason I usually use Vim in a terminal session instead of the GUI version.

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT In Europe, Trains Are Full, and More Are on the Way Amid concerns about climate change, demand for rail service is strong, and both governments and private investors are trying to keep up. Even Eurostar may see competition on its London-Paris route. Share full article 569 A high-speed Eurostar train outside Paris. Credit... Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters By Paige McClanahan Jan. 4, 2024 Paris to Venice. Barcelona to Amsterdam. Brussels to Bratislava, Slovakia. European cities could see a flurry of new rail connections in the next few years, as governments and private investors respond to climate concerns and strive to keep up with strong demand for cross-border passenger rail traffic. Patience is required: Some new connections will take a year or more to start operating, and there will be the occasional inconveniences — like the six-month suspension of nonstop service from Amsterdam to London beginning in June, as Amsterdam’s Central Station undergoes renovations. The route that passes under the English Channel could also have some slow-building changes in the works. Eurostar has had a monopoly on passenger rail traffic under the Channel for nearly 30 years. But the Channel Tunnel is open access, and competitors are lining up to offer additional services between Britain and the continent. It’s all part of Europe’s ongoing rail renaissance, which is being driven in large part by strong interest from passengers. “For long-distance travel, trains are full — and we have more demand than supply. This is true for day trains as well as night trains,” said Alberto Mazzola, the executive director of the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies, a Brussels-based industry group. He attributed the rise in demand to passengers’ concerns about the climate as well as trains’ increasing price competitiveness with flights. For example, on Thetrainline.com, a popular platform for train bookings in Europe, a round-trip rail journey between Paris and Geneva in late January starts at 63 euros, or about $69, including luggage. On Google Flights, the cheapest round-trip ticket is 148 euros, not counting fees for checked luggage or airport transfers. “The big problem that we have is lack of infrastructure,” Dr. Mazzola said, noting that train stations are the biggest bottleneck, followed by capacity on the lines themselves. Governments, including in Germany and France, are making major investments in infrastructure, he added, although these projects could take several years to bear fruit. But passengers are ready to go. Across the European Union, passenger rail transport saw a 50 percent jump between 2021 and 2022, landing at nearly 245 billion miles traveled — just five percent shy of 2019 levels. Based on feedback from rail operators around Europe, Dr. Mazzola expects to see the trend continue when 2023 data are released. Cross-Channel competition Gwendoline Cazenave, the chief executive of Eurostar, said that growth is also strong on the cross-Channel route, where passenger numbers for 2023 were close to their prepandemic high of over 11 million. “The demand for sustainable railway travel is really booming,” Ms. Cazenave said, adding that by 2030, Eurostar aims to transport 30 million passengers every year across its network — which includes stops in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, as well as Britain and France. Competitors are taking note, especially on the cross-Channel route. “People have realized that it’s a lucrative market, and Eurostar is helping them by pricing high,” said Mark Smith, the founder of the rail travel website The Man in Seat 61 and a former station manager at London’s Charing Cross station. Mr. Smith noted that he has “never seen this much interest” from potential competitors, and that a successful challenger could be good news for passengers. “There is no doubt that rail-on-rail competition keeps fares down,” Mr. Smith said. (A recent search revealed that a round-trip Eurostar trip between Paris and London in late January started at 141 euros, or about $154, compared to 64 euros for round-trip flights, not including luggage fees.) In October, Evolyn — a new rail operator led by the Spanish Cosmen family, travel-industry heavyweights — announced that it had reached an agreement with the French train manufacturer Alstom to secure between 12 and 16 high-speed trains for the cross-Channel route. “There is room for business there,” said Estefanía Campos, a spokeswoman for Evolyn. She added that the company’s cross-Channel service would begin in 2025, with full operations coming online in 2026. The British businessman Richard Branson could also be preparing a bid. In November, The Telegraph, citing unnamed sources, reported that Mr. Branson, the owner of Virgin Group, a multinational venture capital corporation, was “plotting a rival operation” on Eurostar’s flagship route. When asked about the news article, the company said that it “doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation.” Heuro, in the Netherlands, also announced plans for a cross-Channel route. Direct service between Amsterdam and London, with up to 16 trains per day traveling in each direction, is scheduled to begin in 2028. Roemer van den Biggelaar, a Heuro co-founder, noted that there are now more than 50 flights a day between Amsterdam and London, compared to only four or five train departures. “We need to shake up this market,” said Mr. van den Biggelaar. “We need someone with a vision to come along and say, ‘OK, guys, let’s work together to get all those people out of the planes.’” But any challenger will face logistical challenges. New European border controls planned for late 2024 will mean that non-European passengers setting off from London will have to go through a biometric security check — including facial recognition and fingerprints — before they board their train across the Channel. And both the St. Pancras Station in London and the Gare du Nord in Paris would have to undergo renovations to make space for additional trains and passengers. Ms. Campos of Evolyn and Mr. van den Biggelaar of Heuro said their companies were working with the relevant authorities to find solutions. But there is plenty of space for competitors. “This is an open-access tunnel, so there’s no favoritism in that,” said John Keefe, a spokesman for GetLink Group, the company that manages the rail infrastructure under the Channel. “There is room for more high-speed trains to run through the tunnel,” he said. Other new connections Competitors may be lining up for the London-Paris route, but elsewhere startups are among those looking to build direct connections where none now exist. In May, the Dutch-Belgian company European Sleeper started overnight service between Brussels and Berlin. It is scheduled to extend to Dresden, Germany, and Prague in the spring. European Sleeper is also planning direct service between Amsterdam and Barcelona in 2025. Meanwhile, Midnight Trains, a Paris-based startup, is working to build overnight routes in and out of Paris — including to Milan, Venice, Florence, Rome, Barcelona and Madrid. They plan to launch the first service, Paris-Milan-Venice, in 2025. And in Central Europe, Leo Express, based in Prague, already operates a network that connects the Czech capital to Krakow and Bratislava, among other cities. The company has applied for approval to begin running a daily 19-hour service between Bratislava and Brussels, which could launch as soon as late 2024. The national railways are also involved. In September, the German transport minister, Volker Wissing, vowed to free up 40 billion euros, about $43.6 billion, to revitalize the country’s rail network. “The rail infrastructure has been neglected for decades and brought to its absolute limits,” Dr. Wissing said in a statement. “This is no longer acceptable and unworthy of a progressive economic nation. We need the railroads as a climate-friendly mode of transport.” In Spain, the government has opened up its high-speed rail network to private competition with great success. And the national rail operator, Renfe, recently started direct services between Madrid and the French coastal city of Marseille, and between Barcelona and Lyon, France. And in France, President Emmanuel Macron promised in 2020 to revitalize the country’s rail network to promote the country’s “ecological transition.” Overnight services have recently restarted between Paris and Nice, Paris and Vienna, and Paris and Aurillac, in the south. Paris is also now enjoying direct overnight service to and from Berlin, the result of a collaboration between the national railway companies of France, Germany, Belgium and Austria. The French transport minister, Clément Beaune, was among those aboard the inaugural train, which pulled into Paris’s Gare de l’Est on the morning of Dec. 12. “It was magnificent,” Mr. Beaune told a reporter waiting to greet him on the platform. “It’s a symbol that we need at the moment.” Paige McClanahan, a frequent contributor to the Travel section, is the author of “The New Tourist: Waking up to the Power and Perils of Travel,” forthcoming from Scribner in June 2024.

Flying always comes with security hassle. A train is just: get in&#x2F;get out.If Europe would just spent more money on infrastructure.We have trains in Germany that can do 350km&#x2F;h but I&#x27;ve yet to ride one that goes faster than 200, probably because the rails aren&#x27;t what they&#x27;re used to be.Then we have the Germany Ticket. A 50€&#x2F;month subscription to all regional trains (not the fast ones). Which removes the hassle of dealing with local subway and bus companies.But the trains are often late, which sucks, especially if you want to ride in the evening.If Europe could get on Japan&#x27;s level, that would be a dream. reply cassepipe 13 hours agoparentPersonally my main gripe is not so much the speed as going to higher speed is probably less efficient hence more expensive.My main gripe is the price (I am poor by european standards). For example going from Paris to Napoli only by train is currently above 300 euros whereas you can find a flight for 40 euros. I am ready to pay around 100 euros for that. Recently there was sleeper car train from Paris to Milano which was affordable but the company did not last alas. I am personally ready to pay more in order to avoid a flight, I don&#x27;t even care about the time it takes, I like being on trains. Sleeper cars are even better. The only thing is the price. reply egman_ekki 12 hours agorootparentSo much this. We’re so spolied by low cost airlines in Europe.I can either - go for a train trip to the 2nd largest city in Denmark (Copenhagen to Aarhus) for 230 eur (2 adults + a kid) and it takes almost 3 hours. - take a Ryanair flight to Alicante for 240 eur (2 adults + a kid), flight takes 3.5 hoursThe weather will be much better, the food and accommodation cheaper by a long shot (not to mention Spanish cuisine). It’s not even comparable how much more value you get when flying. reply chris-orgmenta 9 hours agorootparentprevI think that the hidden benefits of open travel is highly elastic.That is to say, that if we subsidized train travel, then there are benefits (open trade, comms, etc.) that are easily realised but that we don&#x27;t see.I feel it is so elastic (sorry, I&#x27;m misusing this term somewhat) that you can subsidize to an extremely high percentage without net cost (if all externalities could actually be known and costed in)I want train journeys to be 50Euro Athens-Stockholm. 10Euro Paris-Hamburg. I want my taxes to pay the difference. reply PeterStuer 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is because of the extreme subsidies air traffic receives. If it were not for these rail would be very competitive. reply philjohn 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s worse in the UK. Paris to Napoli is a long distance. London to Birmingham walk up fair can be £150. reply eigenket 14 hours agoparentprevIn my opinion the main \"low hanging fruit\" Europe has with trains are international birders, especially if they&#x27;re trying to compete with flying.Trains in Poland work great, trains in Germany work pretty well but every train I&#x27;ve taken between Poland and Germany has been delayed. The standard thing is that while you&#x27;re in Poland they claim the delay is because of previous delays in Germany and while you&#x27;re in Germany they blame delays from Poland.If you&#x27;re trying to do something more advanced like get across Germany to Belgium or France & eventually the UK the it gets quite annoying. reply ddek 14 hours agorootparentGerman trains wishing to enter Switzerland need to wait at the border so the DB’s, err, _erratic_ scheduling doesn’t perturb the much more rigorous Swiss system.My experience of German trains is one train arriving on time, to find my connection is delayed, but actually leaving earlier because the same train 1h before was 54 minutes late and I could get that instead. reply enaaem 14 hours agorootparentprevJust built a separate international network, with its own separate system and tracks. The way Japan handles complexity is through redundancy. Japan runs both really old trains, hyper modern high speed rail and everything in between. Each system runs on separate tracks, are from different companies, and are not interconnected.This can be a lesson on how to run complex systems in general. reply The_Colonel 12 hours agorootparentWhy not build parallel tracks, but with the same gauge?> This can be a lesson on how to run complex systems in general.This sounds like cargo culting. Japan has great train system, it has to be because of separate gauges! reply throwup238 12 hours agorootparent> Why not build parallel tracks, but with the same gauge?Jevon&#x27;s paradox [1] probably. The most profitable part of the rail system will grow to crowd out and interfere with the rest. By keeping it different gauges, they all operate independent of each other&#x27;s incentives.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jevons_paradox reply The_Colonel 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t really see this dynamic working in rail. In Japan, many of the companies operate trains on two gauges.People read too much into this, it&#x27;s mostly just historical reasons. Most slow Japanese rail has a quite narrow gauge which is less suitable for high speed trains. The interoperability benefit is limited since you typically won&#x27;t want to operate both Shinkanzens and local trains on the same rail.Having different gauges provides no real benefit. It&#x27;s just that unifying gauges provides too little benefit to justify the massive investment required. I expect this to be the same for most other countries. (and for similar problems like different railway electrification systems within&#x2F;across countries) reply enaaem 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause different countries might have different gauges. Japanese system is great not because they have different gauges, but because they don’t see it as a problem if there are different gauges. In general, Japan has many train companies that run on totally separate systems. reply DrNosferatu 13 hours agorootparentprevEnaaem: It already works that way. The Iberic Peninsula has a different rail gauge from Central Europe, but - in parallel to Iberian Gauge - is building and expanding its TGV network, which is in the Central European gauge. So, a secondary network. reply zirgs 12 hours agorootparentprev> Just built a separate international network, with its own separate system and tracks.This is what Rail Baltica is going to be. The Baltics are using the Russian gauge, but RB will be using the standard gauge. And it won&#x27;t be connected to the existing railway system.

Had to cancel my trip — this is really a shame, that EU cannot fix cross-border connectivity. reply bigfudge 12 hours agorootparentI think everyone complaining about DB should be forced to live in the UK for a short while first. My 15 yo daughter has just come back from her first trip to Koln to stay with friends. She was wide eyed with how well everything worked, and how nice the trains were. It was interesting to me to see that she saw it too and it’s not just jaded politics that makes me think the UK is going to the dogs. reply eigenket 12 hours agorootparentMy experience is at UK trains are a bit more reliable at turning up on time than DB.

DB website was simply showing an error at the last step. A month later, by the moment error was gone all tickets appeared sold. reply eigenket 11 hours agorootparentIf you run into the problem again try the website of the Polish trains pkp.pl. You&#x27;ll probably have to Google translate some stuff but it works well. reply donalhunt 12 hours agorootparentprevDid Prague to Brussels in one day (~ 12 hours) in 2010 and everything just worked. One connection in Frankfurt airport (it has a train station) and it was cheaper than flying. Will need to check how I bought the ticket but do know it was bought as a single ticket.Good thing I left early in the morning because the later trains to Germany all got stuck in heavy snow downfalls. \\o&#x2F; reply pixl97 14 hours agorootparentprev>Germany and while you&#x27;re in Germany they blame delays from Poland.Both can be true at the same time.Developing enough capacity to avoid non-blocking train systems and bunching is a difficult issue. reply bradley13 12 hours agoparentprevGerman rail infrastructure is...in need of help. Here, in Switzerland, many trains come from Germany. Well, they did. They are so often late that some routes now stop at the border, so that the Swiss schedule isn&#x27;t impacted by German problems.Germany is also years behind on putting cargo onto trains for transit through the Alps. Even Italy was faster. reply bigfudge 12 hours agorootparentThis is true, but I have watched with amusement as a Swiss station master paced, tutted and finally started swearing under his breath as a train from Milan got later and later. It amazed me at the time he cared so much - it seemed personal. But I guess that’s why Swiss rail is so great - that and the funding. reply ecnahc515 10 hours agorootparentYeah that&#x27;s a very Swiss thing. People get upset when trains are more than 1-2 minutes late. It&#x27;s so reliable even a delay ofFlying always comes with security hassleUnfortunately that is not the case, the security theater seems to be slowly contaminating rail too.The Barcelona->Paris connection has some bullshit security on the Barcelona side (luggage x-ray & plastic trays for laptops), and I think the Eurostar had some of this on the London side too. reply kergonath 11 hours agorootparentI cannot say for Spain, but for the Eurostar it has been like that for quite a long time and it is related to the Schengen area border. The checks are made on boarding, so in Paris, Lille, London, Brussels, and Amsterdam before they started refurbishing the station (I am not sure about seasonal destinations but I can’t see how they could avoid checks at some point). It is not an example of increasing security theatre. reply tsm 52 minutes agorootparentSpain has had train security even on long-distance domestic journeys at least since I lived there in 2008. I suspect it&#x27;s a reaction to the train bombing they had, but don&#x27;t quote me. reply donalhunt 12 hours agorootparentprevEurostar has had airport-style security for long time (maybe always?). Definitely 10+ years anyway. reply frereubu 11 hours agorootparentThis is partly to do with the fact that the UK was never part of the Schengen group of countries (i.e. countries where you can travel from one to the other without a passport), even when it was part of the EU. reply jamil7 12 hours agorootparentprevI changed in Barcelona on my way to Madrid and went through this too, it seems like it&#x27;s specific to Spain&#x2F;Barcelona, at least for now. reply Scoundreller 12 hours agorootparentprevI went through that Barcelona one, and it must have been the weakest security I’ve ever seen.Dude wasn’t even looking at the xray machine screen.ICAO or whomever audits airport security would shit their pants if the Barcelona rail station had the same scrutiny. reply wongarsu 12 hours agoparentprev> small EuropeEurope the continent is 7% larger than the US. It&#x27;s not that small. The population is just comparatively evenly spread out reply JJMcJ 14 hours agoparentprev> small EuropeEurope isn&#x27;t microscopic. Paris to Amsterdam is about 300 miles, which is the same as Chicago to Cleveland. This is for intercity travel, and of course in the Western USA, except for the Pacific Coast, it is really not very dense. reply n4r9 14 hours agoparentprev> the trains are often late, which sucksTraveling on Deutsche Bahn in the hopes of making a late Eurostar connection was nailbiting for this reason. I hear that Switzerland is strict about cancelling late trains so as not to interfere with the overall schedule, and as a consequence most DB trains from Germany don&#x27;t make it past the border. reply lores 9 hours agoparentprevEurope is always referred to as \"small\", but it&#x27;s actually bigger than the US. It changes the perspective somewhat when you keep that in mind. reply Wytwwww 12 hours agoparentprev> If Europe could get on Japan&#x27;s level, that would be a dream.To be fair Germany could at least reach France&#x27;s or Italy&#x27;s level first. reply rubymamis 12 hours agorootparentTrains in Italy and Spain were so much better than trains in Germany (I was a nomad in Europe for 1.5 years). reply nilsherzig 10 hours agorootparentIn what way? reply mcv 8 hours agorootparentI have no experience with trains in Spain or Italy, but trains in Germany are notoriously unreliable. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a single train trip through Germany in the past year without some kind of delay and extra hassle.For our summer vacation, we travelled from Amsterdam to Switzerland. We had first class seats with one layover in Frankfurt. Frankfurt was a mess, the train was sent to a different station, our connecting train was cancelled, we had 5 layovers instead of 1, and had to stand. When we finally got to sit, we had no reserved seats and were split up. On the return trip, similar problem, though with less extra layovers.A few months later, I went to Essen by train. The ICE stopped at Düsseldorf and the connection to Essen was delayed or I missed it because the UCE was delayed. Still best train experience in Germany that year.The return from Essen, the train from Essen back to Düsseldorf was cancelled, and the connecting bus would guarantee I&#x27;d miss my last ICE and I&#x27;d have to spend the night at Düsseldorf. Instead, I paid a lot of money for a taxi to race me there. Got there in time, and at the last minute they sent the ICE to a different platform without clear notification, and I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of people still missed that train. I fortunately noticed some people leaving the platform and informed some others who hadn&#x27;t noticed.Trains in Netherland and Switzerland are absolutely perfect, but to get from one to the other you have to go through Germany, and that&#x27;s a problem. reply chimeracoder 12 hours agorootparentprev> To be fair Germany could at least reach France&#x27;s or Italy&#x27;s level first.I&#x27;m not sure Germany should be looking to Italy for advice on getting the trains to run on time. reply mcv 8 hours agorootparentIs Italy worse than Germany? That&#x27;s hard to believe. reply MrDresden 14 hours agoparentprevNo need to get to Japans level.Just matching the Netherlands in punctuality and connections would be more than enough (using the word &#x27;just&#x27; here does not do their rail network the justice it deserves). reply com 13 hours agorootparentArgh. I moved away but am back in NL regularly and the train service has degraded beyond all recognition for me done in comparison to 2021 or so.Short trains, cancellation of 75% of scheduled services for random reasons, regular failures on key links (Amsterdam CS&#x2F;Zuid-Schiphol, HSL-Zuid, Delft-Rotterdam etc etc) leading to widespread network disruptions.NS wasn’t perfect before, but it sure seems that they and their evil twin, ProRail, aren’t even trying any more. reply static_motion 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s interesting to read. I recently visited the Netherlands on vacation and one of the things I was most impressed by was the train service. I came away from an excellent opinion of NS, but I&#x27;d probably chalk that down to my extensive experience with Portugal&#x27;s own national train service which is an absolute clown show on rails. reply asdff 13 hours agoparentprevDo they have a similar program to TSA precheck in europe? That has really changed flying for a lot of airports in the US, to the point where it kind of is now a quick thing you can just get in&#x2F;get out, only real issue being the artificial barriers airlines put on your like having to check in to the flight a certain time before boarding and having to board a certain time before doors are closed. reply harha 13 hours agorootparentExcept for Germany and the UK where trains are also quite bad, security usually doesn’t take too long. Boarding is typically 15 mins before the flight, but then again airports are usually more comfortable to navigate than train stations since you get rid of your large luggage in the first step reply vizzah 11 hours agoparentprev\"A train is just: get in&#x2F;get out\" - alas, not really. High-speed AVE trains in Spain are subject to security checks with you&#x2F;your luggage going through the scanners. Fortunately, no need to take out laptops, throw water away, put liquids in a transparent bag and other nonsense. reply morsch 13 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;ve yet to ride one that goes faster than 200, probably because the rails aren&#x27;t what they&#x27;re used to be.Then you are riding odd routes because the ICE hits 250 all the time.

Flying is usually much more reliable in Germany as long as it doesn&#x27;t snow (but trains are stopped too when it snows anyway). Trains in Germany are: 1- constantly delayed (ironically I already missed my flight because of that) 2- very expensive (unless you&#x27;ve hours to waste on regional trains) 3- slow in average (yes it can clock at 300kmh+ for 20 minutes just to get stuck behind a freight train using the same network..) reply ivan_gammel 12 hours agorootparent4. German train can use a completely different route to destination, dropping all passengers who were going to an intermediate station somewhere early on the route (you figure out yourselves how to get home at this late hour). I was on board of ICE from Rostock to Berlin which was suddenly routed via Greifswald with arrival in Berlin delayed by 2 hours. There was some fire on the tracks between Oranienburg and Berlin. reply LargoLasskhyfv 13 hours agoparentprevYou also have Thalys in .de which is not just get in. The same goes for Eurostar. Maybe more, but I don&#x27;t know about them.That aside, some could do 350kph in theory, but there are no tracks anywhere which are certified for more than 330kph in regular daily operations. With the additional constraint of limiting that to 280 kph max after several fuck ups, which I don&#x27;t know about if that limit was lifted, or not.And if you think you could board the Japanese fast ones at Deutschlandticket prices? Dream on! :-)Anyways, it was fun to use one of the very first ICEs on the runway right side of the Rhine from Cologne to Bankfurt and back at 331kph, sometimes parallel to the A3 at a distance of only few 100meters, and watching the lichthupenden and warnblinkenden Nieten in Nadelstreifen trying to overtake the Normalos, while they seemingly stood still. Some sort of parallax-effect, I guess.At that times I&#x27;ve thought: \"Wozu brauch ich noch mal &#x27;nen scheiss Transrapid?\" reply jhoechtl 13 hours agorootparent> lichthupenden and warnblinkenden Nieten in Nadelstreifen trying to overtake the Normalos,Thank you, made my day.

Airport Berlin, Stuttgart 21, constantly late running trains? Is Germany over-engineered and over-regulated, what&#x27;s the issue? reply amadeuspagel 12 hours agorootparentTrains being late is simply an overrated problem. This is not something that DB should optimize for. It would be easy to make sure every train is punctual by running one Munich-Berlin-Hamburg train a day.Trains are late because they run a demanding schedule, trying to serve every big city (this is not like France where everything is supposed to go through Paris, this is a country that unified late with many powerful regions who all want direct connections between them). reply ivan_gammel 11 hours agorootparentSchedule isn’t the root cause. DB has serious problems with staffing, because their workforce is going to retire soon in large numbers and finding replacement is hard. They have problems with infrastructure: it is telling that a heavy rain, moderate snowfall or burning grass can knock out a major route. Both are management problems. reply jamil7 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s just poorly governed at every level by geriatric politicians&#x2F;managers and has an enormous older population keeping them there. reply Barrin92 12 hours agorootparentprevNot really. It&#x27;s just heavily used and so the faults are very obvious, and we Germans are extremely quick to complain. Objectively there&#x27;s not much of a difference and for almost all European countries it&#x27;s complaint at a high level[1]Of course Stuttgart 21 is objectively a mess but Germany is big, there&#x27;s more than just a handful of engineering projects at any given time. We brought a pretty substantial amount of LNG capacity online in just two years but that never gets any press compared to the latest airport chaos.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.... reply tpm 13 hours agoparentprevWhat isn&#x27;t awesome is cross-border trains, it&#x27;s always ad-hoc.

Even taking the extremely conservative measurement of Madrid to Berlin, that&#x27;s 1200 miles&#x2F;2000 km, which is comparable to the entire length of the Japanese isles, or the distance from Beijing to the South China Sea, or the distance from Boston to Minneapolis and&#x2F;or Miami. Speaking as an American, I&#x27;d be over the moon if our passenger rail was half as nice as Europe&#x27;s, and we can&#x27;t even use the scale of the country as an excuse. reply muspimerol 13 hours agorootparentThe scale of the country is an excuse in many cases. There are densely populated areas in many parts of the USA, but nearly all of Europe is densely populated.

Maybe that will change if more sleeper carriages are introduced. reply scott_w 13 hours agorootparent> The EU has an average density of 112 people per square km compared to 36 in the USA.Isn&#x27;t that a misleading statistic, though? It&#x27;s not like the USA is an evenly spread wasteland in comparison to Continental Europe. It&#x27;s more like pockets of high population density throughout, which trains can handle perfectly well. Russia and Ukraine are similar in that they&#x27;re pockets of cities separated by miles of steppe. Both are known for heavily using rail travel.Hell, wasn&#x27;t the USA built on the back of continental rail travel during its industrial revolution? reply ericmay 13 hours agorootparentYep, it&#x27;s misleading. The America is big argument fails to hold water once you actually take a look at a map. Take Columbus for example where we&#x27;re within just a couple hours by train (could be less if we had any sort of seriousness about our country) away from: Chicago Detroit Cleveland Cincinnati Indianapolis Pittsburghand maybe just a few hours away from other cities like Toronto, Buffalo, Louisville, and more. reply kasey_junk 12 hours agorootparentThe US has the largest rail network in the world (for now). It’s hugely dominated by freight.It’s not for lack of rail lines we don’t have good passenger service it’s a priority and preference issue.If you got a fast train between Indianapolis and Cleveland what would you do with it? Neither has reasonable public transit and aren’t dense cities that are good for walking. They also are only 4.5 hours away from each other by car, something residents of both largely own. reply ericmay 12 hours agorootparentChicken-egg problem with the density. But we know that things can change and it&#x27;s always surprising when we&#x27;re always very open to changing things when it comes to technology, but other areas we&#x27;re not so open to it. Amsterdam is a canonical example [1] or how you can fix infrastructure.Example: I am not the biggest soccer fan in the world, but I might take a train down to Cincinnati and get dinner, stay the night, and watch Columbus play Cincinnati. I&#x27;m not doing that with a car because of parking and it being a big hassle. If I can take a train down there, I&#x27;m way more likely to go. Once I get there the very first time I&#x27;ll just arrive in the downtown area, plenty to walk around to see and do. The same is true for the reverse trip. Someone coming from Cincinnati can arrive in the Short North in Columbus and walk anywhere they want from German Village to Downtown to Ohio State&#x27;s campus.I&#x27;m not entirely sure about Cleveland (haven&#x27;t been in a while) or Indianapolis (haven&#x27;t been maybe ever?) w.r.t to walking around, but in the example I gave you can see there is plenty to do with a train that gets you from one of the example cities to another and it only improves as more and more people use the service.Funny actually. What you were saying kind of applies to cars too. You&#x27;d just drive through or around Indianapolis. After all once you park there&#x27;s nothing to do and nowhere to go.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;cities&#x2F;2015&#x2F;may&#x2F;05&#x2F;amsterdam-bic... reply pi-e-sigma 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m shocked to learn that only a 1%, yes, ONE percent of American rail network is electrified.

I&#x27;d argue that car-only infrastructure is actually a gigantic financial disaster as well but it requires additional examination. reply conceptme 12 hours agorootparentprevI think trains amd especially the rails mostly are funded through other ways (government&#x2F; taxes) something which americans are not too fond of. reply muspimerol 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s an average, so of course it says nothing about the distribution. I don&#x27;t find that to be misleading, or at least I did not intend to insinuate that the USA is a perfectly distributed wasteland! It shows that while the EU and US kind of look similar in size, actually their population density on average is wildly different. Just look at a population density map of both continents side by side. It&#x27;s fine to talk about certain parts of the USA being dense and able to support passenger rail. But when we talk about country-scale rail systems, that&#x27;s where I have a bone to pick.As I said, there are areas of the USA that are perfectly suitable to rail, and there should be more.My criticism is the notion of \"you can technically take a train from Madrid to Berlin, so you should also be able to take a train from Boston to Minneapolis\". Trains in Europe go long distances, but most importantly they connect a lot of medium-sized cities along the way. reply sophacles 13 hours agorootparentBoston to minneapolis could pass through:MA: SpringfieldNY: Albany, Buffalo,RochesterOh: Sandusky, Cleavland, Toledo,IN: Fort wayneIL: Chicago, Rockford,WI: Madison, LaCrosse, Eu Claire, MilwaukeeWith some fairly minor deviations on the path. (Assuming a fairly straight path that stays in the US, going south of the lakes). Depending on your tolerance for minor deviations from the straightest possible path it could be all or a subset, but not none of those. They are all medium sized or larger cities.There are ton of small cities too, but the train doesnt have to stop in each one - there&#x27;s lots of through trains in Europe to that skip towns&#x2F;cities they pass. reply muspimerol 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know why we&#x27;re still stuck on the BerlinMadrid topic, but I&#x27;ll bite :-)I added up the population of all those cities: 6.13 million. The population of Berlin and Madrid alone is 6.86 million, and our theoretical journey would take us through several cities of 1m+ along the way: Cologne, Brussels, Paris... The dense parts of Europe have 500k+ cities basically overlapping.As someone who grew up in the Midwest, I would absolutely love this theoretical train, but I&#x27;m not surprised it doesn&#x27;t exist (yet)! reply Wytwwww 12 hours agorootparent> I added up the population of all those cities: 6.13 million.Well just Boston (where it would presumably start) is over 4 million (and whole Massachusetts is almost as dense as Belgium). Minneapolis is another ~3 million. Chicago is over 8 million. I didn&#x27;t even look up the other cities... yeah it&#x27;s lower but really not as much as you&#x27;re implying. reply muspimerol 11 hours agorootparentOh if we&#x27;re talking about metro area population, then the EU route is also significantly higher (for example, Paris goes from 2 million to 13 million). I was just looking at city limits in both cases.Honestly I agree with your sentiment. We should connect all these urban areas with passenger rail. But I don&#x27;t think that this is the first step. Most American cities have atrocious public transit, which needs to be fixed first. No one will take a train from Chicago to Minneapolis if they just have to rent a car once they get there anyway. It would be a shame to invest billions in connecting cities with high speed rail, only to have low ridership because it still doesn&#x27;t compete with flying&#x2F;driving. reply sophacles 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a bit misleading to claim: \"The dense parts of Europe have 500k+ cities basically overlapping.\", while pretending that Chicago doesn&#x27;t have 6M+ additional people in its immediate suburbs who would also be able to use this hypothetical train. The US and EU structure administrative units a bit differently, so using the Urban or Metro populations for both is a better metric for population served.I agree that Europe is more densly populated than US, so there would be longer stretches without a stop in the US. But that&#x27;s OK - the long-distance trains in the EU don&#x27;t stop at every station along the way anyway, it would just be a different structure of \"locals\" and \"through trains\" to service the poulations.I disagree however that population density is even all that relevant. All the cities in the US that I&#x27;ve mentioned have rail through them already. It&#x27;s used profitably for freight all the time. I think the US doesn&#x27;t have good passenger rail service because of a heck of a lot of other factors - subsidies favoring cars and planes over rail for transit, infrastructure having been created around getting everyone an automobile, a huge amount of FUD from various lobbies against rail (including arguments about population density), and a dozen others probably have more actual impact than \"people per square mile is different on average\". reply muspimerol 11 hours agorootparentSure, all mega cities have even larger metro areas. I&#x27;m not pretending Chicago doesn&#x27;t have a huge metro area. But my point stands: the European route has much higher catchment than your proposed USA route, even if you include metro areas. Population density is not the only argument, although I think it&#x27;s pretty clear why the US and EU are not comparable: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luminocity3d.org&#x2F;WorldPopDen&#x2F;#4&#x2F;38.51&#x2F;-51.06 Most of the US looks more like Spain and less like Central Europe.There needs to be local public transportation infrastructure. This is where the US should be focusing efforts, no long-distance high-speed trains. It works in Europe because there are huge catchment areas (see population density) that funnel riders to regional hubs that are then connected with high speed trains. I don&#x27;t think the first step to making rail work in the US is connecting metropolises with high-speed trains. Until there&#x27;s a better local public transportation story, it&#x27;s expensive and impractical once you arrive at your destination. replyajuc 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, it&#x27;s not population density that&#x27;s important but the distribution of said population, and USA is more urbanized and clumped up than many European countries with much better train system than USA.The problem in USA is that the people making the decisions don&#x27;t live in the cities. reply LargoLasskhyfv 13 hours agorootparentprevAs a child, at about 11 to 12, so about 1981&#x2F;82 I took the train from Bonn am Rhein to Madrid, and back to Bonn from Aguilas or Alicante.

It is slowly improving (I just checked a particularly absurd example where Deutsche Bahn was unable to sell a ticket to switzerland through if it wasn&#x27;t bought a long time in advance - seems at least they fixed that), but still... it&#x27;s absurd if your train trip starts with \"figure out how to get a ticket, because the train company won&#x27;t tell you.\" reply hnaccount_rng 13 hours agorootparentOh that&#x27;s nothing. 5 years ago DB couldn&#x27;t sell you all tickets within Germany (if you didn&#x27;t cross a Verkehrsverbund boundary the local train company could refuse to license that right to DB).

Some experiences: From Holland, It was impossible to do an online booking a ticket to Italy. Only possible via phone, or as separate legs. For long journeys with changeovers watch out that you don’t get stuck halfway due to a missed connection. From NL, London, France, Germany is easily reachable, as well as Barcelona. I took a sleeper train to Stockholm last Christmas, we had delays, but made it in time. In general if you have a long distance leg, it’s best to have it at the start of your journey so you don’t miss it.Railways do have single points of failure. A single disruption on a key piece of track can disrupt service for hours, even days. This is less of an issue with air travel, there’s usually other airlines, and alternative routes. reply umpalumpaaa 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is not really true.

For instance in Germany the auto industry and its lobby is strong enough to succeed in keeping freeways toll free, whereas the German Railways infrastructure part was split out into a company called DB Netz. So when you buy a ticket the cost of using the railway infrastructure is included in the price. Also other things, but not relevant for this discussion.So yes the railway is a lot better in Europe and the rest of the world than the US, but it&#x27;s almost always a question of politics and interests of different groups.

If you invest more in trains, they become more attractive, and people gravitate towards them. The same is true of cars, busses, etc... How each mode of transport scales influences whether you want to induce demand for it.AFAICT trains scale pretty well in terms of space and environmental impact, and point-to-point latency decreases as more trains are run (and transfer times decrease), so it&#x27;s pretty nice to induce demand for it. reply dist-epoch 12 hours agoprevIn UK a train from London to Edinburgh (North of UK, Scotland) costs more than a plane.I just don&#x27;t understand how that makes any sense, how can a train be more expensive than a plane. reply Yujf 11 hours agoparentA plane flies faster so you can amortize the cost over more flights. A plane only requires 2 airports, which can be used as a starting point to connect with any other airport again amortizing the cost over many flights.

And quote from the first link:> 91% say they want to replace short-distance flights by fast, low-polluting trains in collaboration with neighbouring countriesSee how a train being fast was bundled into the question.Let’s forget about environment for a moment. Going by plane is a lot less convenient, when you can take a train, due to needing to show up a lot earlier at the airport, going through security and all kinds of overhead. So when trains work, i.e. they’re fast, reliable and affordable, nobody needs environmental concerns to use them.For me to be convinced that someone is taking a train for environmental reasons, the train would need to be more expensive for them than going by plane. Because otherwise everyone likes to see themselves in a good light and say how much their choices are dictated by ethics, when in reality the wallet is often a more potent motivator than environmental concerns. Just like every employer likes to say that they hire and promote based on merit, but then it turns out that on average taller people get hired and promoted more often. And the employers will still believe that they weren’t influenced by that. Just like travellers will overestimate the influence of environmental concerns on their choice of mode of transport. In both cases it’s because people like to see themselves in good light.
