    "commentBody": "FCC rules AI-generated voices in robocalls illegal (fcc.gov)1013 points by ortusdux 16 hours agohidepastfavorite594 comments ortusdux 11 hours agoI think it is important to note that the legal principle that allows the FCC to make rulings like this is called Chevron Deference, and many consider it to be under attack. https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/01/supreme-court-likely-to-d... reply yttribium 9 hours agoparentThis thread wildly misunderstands \"chevron deference\". \"Ending chevron deference\" does not somehow throw us into a Mad Max anarchic hellscape where agencies cannot actually do anything, because there is always some standard for what administrative rulemaking is permissible. There is a broader question of how much leeway they have, but clarifying that AI generated voices count as \"artificial\" under the statute barely requires a regulation, any more than they need one to say \"hit in the head with a computer\" constitutes an \"assault\". reply hedora 5 hours agorootparentThe problem with your argument is that, for decades, congress has been passing and failing to update laws under the understanding that the courts would apply Chevron deference. If the courts decide to get rid of that, they're intentionally misinterpreting the laws that congress has passed over that time. They're also effectively rewriting a large fraction of US law, despite the fact that the constitution is carefully designed to prevent such a small group of (unelected or elected) people from modifying US law that quickly, and without safe guards. The current Supreme Court has repeatedly undermined separation of powers, and they're explicitly doing so against the wishes of the electorate. Their behavior is fundamentally undemocratic. reply jakogut 4 hours agorootparent> Their behavior is fundamentally undemocratic. Correct, because in the United States, our model of government is a Democratic Republic, not a democracy. For all of the flaws of our system of law, the Constitution is considered supreme, and any laws that violate the Constitution are to be considered null and void. The job of the Supreme Court is to decide the Constitutionality of laws. One interpretation of removing Chevron deference is that it's defacto rewriting law, another is that executive agencies have been doing this for decades already. The truth is probably some mix of the two. reply noobermin 1 hour agorootparent>Constitution is considered supreme, and any laws that violate the Constitution are to be considered null and void. The job of the Supreme Court is to decide the Constitutionality of laws. A plain and non-ideological reading of what you typed is that this is a contradiction at best and saying the SCOTUS supersedes the constitution at worst. reply Wolfenstein98k 17 minutes agorootparentOnly if you presuppose that the agency is always right. Agencies are often wrong and sometimes very seriously so. The FDA trying to take over regulation of tests is another example. There is a perfectly legitimate view that Chevron deference is - at least in some circumstances - not indefeasible. reply remarkEon 2 hours agorootparentprev>The problem with your argument is that, for decades, congress has been passing and failing to update laws under the understanding that the courts would apply Chevron deference. It is literally the job of Congress to update laws. That they are bad at doing that is not relevant to the place of the Court in the structure of this country's government. >If the courts decide to get rid of that, they're intentionally misinterpreting the laws that congress has passed over that time. The opposite of this is true. If the Court decides to jettison Chevron deference (you should look in to why that case is called \"Chevron\") it means that gasp our legislators have to actually listen to constituents and write laws and not just bet that the executive branch in the next election cycle agrees with them. reply faramarz 4 hours agorootparentprevUndemocratic or capitalistic but with a cap? If it were such that individual states with greater agency could negatively impact neighbouring states and in Chevrons original case, environment and agriculture, then it’s a dangerous precedent of opening up states to competitive market at the detriment greater societal impact and responsibilities. Both positive and negative but the incentives are there to push towards later in pursuit of fast profits and deferred responsibilities. Am I making sense? States can compete for corporate interests, while we know full well who runs the senate: lobbyists with deep pockets. reply ortusdux 8 hours agorootparentprevImagine the following: The FCC fines a company for using AI-generated voices in robocalls. That company appeals the fine. With Chevron intact, the court would need to defer to the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA and dismiss the appeal. With Chevron overturned, the court would be able to advocate for their own interpretation of the TCPA. A favorable judge could just claim textualism, and insist that the TCPA does not apply because it does not explicitly use the word AI. Then it is a slippery slope of forum shopping and companies moving their operations to districts with sympathetic judges. reply dantheman 7 hours agorootparentImagine the FCC goes to congress, proposes a new rule and then congresses passes it. Then there is debate and congress can't abdicate its responsibility. reply windthrown 7 hours agorootparentIn theory sure but have you been following Congress for the past decade? They can't even come to terms on continuing resolution funding bills, let alone pass complex rules related to new contentious technologies. Perhaps I'm just a pessimist but is something that makes you think this might drastically change? reply lokar 5 hours agorootparentDecade? Nothing substantial has gotten done since Gingrich took over the house in 95. It’s been scorched earth (on both side, mostly) since then. This puts the courts in a difficult situation. The answer is often “congress needs to fix this”, but that can’t actually happen. reply Kamq 5 hours agorootparentprev> In theory sure but have you been following Congress for the past decade? On one hand, fair. On the other hand, you can only coast along on the old post-cold war bi-partisan consensus for so long without getting new consensus before institutions lose their legitimacy (you can already see this happening a bit). We can default back to the last time we had consensus for some things, for some time, but you do need to get it again before big changes happen. If you get to the point where the last time we had consensus is before the majority of the people in the system were alive, you either need to hard pivot your society to focus on ancestor worship, or you need to focus on something you do have consensus on. reply mindslight 3 hours agorootparentThe problem is that the previous consensus was created by corporate centralized media, and in many ways was actually against the interests of most people who accepted it. Now that corporate consensus has fallen apart, so we've got two tribes each focused on the specific ways they were screwed over, with each ascribing the previous state of affairs to the other tribe. In a vacuum their differences could certainly be worked out to support a consensus. But given how well ragebait sensationalism seems to work, and the popularity of feel-good (well, feel-something at least) authoritarian demagogues like Trump, I don't see much hope. reply clarionbell 59 minutes agorootparentprevI would argue that existing setup which abdicates power of congress to courts and agencies is only making things worse. It keeps things running, somewhat, but only by applying bandaids that can be removed just as easily with new set of judges or new administration. It's something that US political system allowed to fester for decades, arguably since 70s. Take the entire situation around abortions. Supreme Court determined that there is a right, based in protection of privacy, that prohibits states from banning abortion before certain date. Congress didn't have to make a law about it, or even add amendment to constitution. So they didn't have to explain anything to their constituents. \"It's the court! I can't do anything!\" everybody was happy. Except not. People who opposed it, saw it as undemocratic. Taking controversial issue out of the hands of representatives forever. So they pushed against it, and attempted to circumvent the ruling. Mostly they failed. But they never gave up, and their movement never died down. In fact it only became more and more powerful. And when they finally had favorable judges on the court they finally had their way. Angering their opponents, who were now using similar \"this isn't democratic\" arguments. In the end, nobody really won. The only certain result is that people on both sides of political spectrum now have reasons to distrust Supreme Court. Compare that to the situation in Europe. Lawmakers took their time, but eventually they arrived at set of laws that most of society agrees with, or at very least is able to tolerate. TLDR: The existing system led to the congress being incapable of making laws. If america is to survive, courts can't keep saving congress from controversial laws. reply brookst 5 hours agorootparentprevImagine that rule is not precise enough to cover every possible specific situation, so nobody can ever be penalized for breaking any rule, as it becomes a fractal problem where the entire year’s “work” from Congress would not be sufficient to exactly define every term needed. Management has to be allowed to delegate. Those saying Congress should not be allowed to do so are really just saying they want the government abolished. reply djur 5 hours agorootparentprevThen the process repeats -- someone sues over the FCC's interpretation of the new rule. What next? reply ortusdux 6 hours agorootparentprevImagine an individual or company (who disagrees with the FCC's interpretation of the law) proposes a new rule to congress and then congress passes it. There is a debate and then congress updates the law they passed to reflect recent changes. reply Kamq 5 hours agorootparentThat's already a thing (in fact, it's guaranteed by the first amendment in the US). Congress can overrule the FCC any time they want. reply jprete 7 hours agorootparentprevRuling that artificial intelligence voices aren't artificial would seriously damage the legitimacy of the court system. reply rpmisms 7 hours agorootparentprevChevron deference would come into play if the FCC tried to say that a test-tube baby was an artificial agent. I support ending the doctrine, because the shadow laws are strong and bad. reply dclowd9901 6 hours agorootparentHow would it? The FCC aren’t experts on the philosophical or scientific difference between artificial and natural insemination. reply rpmisms 6 hours agorootparentUnder the current interpretation, that would be in their jurisdiction. This is why Chevron deference is dumb. reply nielsbot 5 hours agorootparentthat’s ridiculous reply rpmisms 5 hours agorootparentI agree. Chevron deference has (indirectly) led to a shoelace being confiscated by the ATF as a machine gun. reply jakogut 4 hours agorootparentDon't forget about Matt Hoover of CRS Firearms being charged for conspiracy to transfer unregistered machine gun conversion devices. His crime? Advertising a trinket known as an \"Auto Key Card\", a metal business card etched with the outline of a lightning link, a device that--properly manufactured--can make a semi-automatic rifle full-auto. The problem is that this device was nothing more than a drawing on a business card sized piece of steel. It amounts to an egregious first amendment violation at the very least. https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/federal-jury-convicts-t... https://www.pewpewtactical.com/autokeycard-explained/ reply rpmisms 4 hours agorootparentI have not forgotten, I know him and contributed to his defense fund. Absolutely horrendous miscarriage of justice. reply noobermin 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is great that this is line of comments are under an article about banning something most people here would like to see banned. That is in fact doing something good, unless I guess you're on the side of robocalls. Perhaps choose to make this argument in another thread, it'd be far more convincing. reply bbarnett 53 minutes agorootparentThe argument espoused should be examined more directly for things you agree with, otherwise one risks becoming a hypocrite. reply tomoyoirl 8 hours agorootparentprevEven if it was unclear, ending Chevron deference wouldn’t say “the agency can no longer make these policy interpretations.” It just means that a court ought to test whether that interpretation is in compliance with the law, when that comes up in a dispute (which is something that courts are in the business of in many other areas) more so than simply deferring to the agency’s expertise on the law. (If you look at the original Chevron decision, they were much more interested in trying to get out of the “understand and make determinations about complex environmental issues” business anyway, more so than the “understand the law” business.) Postscript: For your next unfairly downvoted reply I recommend that you explain to someone Citizens United was actually a nonprofit trying to air a movie on cable television and was fighting the FEC over it. (Total hackjob of an organization, mind you. But core political speech.) Some facts are unpopular. reply djur 9 hours agoparentprevI agree with you on the importance of Chevron deference, but I can't see any court getting to the second step of Chevron with this particular ruling, so no deference would be required. The legislation bans \"artificial or prerecorded voices\"; AI agents are by definition artificial. reply PaulDavisThe1st 9 hours agorootparent> \"Congress should have used more precise language rather than deferring to the supposed \"expertise\" of members of the administration in order to establish the artificiality of AI\" - SCOTUS, in a judgement not yet issued or rendered (and thus currently wholly imagined by me). reply ortusdux 8 hours agorootparent>\"I ctrl-F'ed the document and didn't find the phrase \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\". Overruled.\" - Strict textualist judge that really loves his new RV. reply hedora 6 hours agorootparentOK, I normally don't trick LLMs into lying or paste their leavings here, but enjoy: > Here are some potential counterfactual arguments that the Chevron doctrine does not allow the FCC from regulating AI robocalls: - The Communications Act of 1934, which gives the FCC authority to regulate communications by wire and radio, does not explicitly grant the FCC authority to regulate AI technology. Since AI was not envisioned at the time the Act was passed, one could argue that Congress did not intend to delegate regulatory authority over AI to the FCC. Therefore, the FCC's regulation of AI robocalls would fail the first step of the Chevron test as not being in accordance with clear congressional intent. - Even if one argues that the FCC's authority to regulate \"communications by wire and radio\" could be broadly interpreted to include AI communications technologies, the FCC's specific regulation of AI robocalls could still be seen as an unreasonable interpretation of the Act under the second step of Chevron. Given the lack of explicit mention of AI in the Act, a court may find that the FCC's assertion of authority to regulate AI robocalls through additional restrictions beyond what applies to standard robocalls is an unreasonable stretch of its delegated authority. - The nature of AI technologies is such that they raise novel issues that were not contemplated at the time of the Communications Act. Heavy-handed regulation of emerging AI technologies by the FCC without clear congressional authorization could stifle innovation. Under these circumstances, one could argue that deference to the FCC's interpretation of its authority is unwarranted. - Kagi FastGPT reply duxup 6 hours agoparentprevWith the speed things move at now I worry about a situation where we have to wait for explicit legislation for every little thing ... reply goodluckchuck 6 hours agoparentprevChevron is facially frivolous. So, an agency says you broke the law. You take the agency to court. The court defers to the agency. You’ve been denied your day in court. reply lettergram 10 hours agoparentprevGlad to see Chevron Deference at the top here. Basically, the FCC can’t “rule” they can “dictate” and this isn’t a power explicitly granted by congress. It’s some made up judicial rules that say these federal agencies can do it reply djur 9 hours agorootparentThe controlling legislation here, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, prohibits initiating \"any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party\" (I got this quote directly from the FCC ruling). The legislation does not define \"artificial or prerecorded voice\". The FCC here is stating that they interpret \"artificial voice\" as including interactive AI voice agents, which did not exist in 1991. Do you think this is an unreasonable interpretation? Or should Congress be required to list exactly what technologies are prohibited in this context and update that list every time something new comes around? reply remarkEon 2 hours agorootparentIn 1991 \"artificial\" probably meant something like \"pre-recorded and re-cut\". Which is basically AI voice generation, but at scale. >Do you think this is an unreasonable interpretation? Or should Congress be required to list exactly what technologies are prohibited in this context and update that list every time something new comes around? Not OP but this is the right question to ask. My answer is yes, congress is quite literally required to update statute to reflect modern technology (ensuring it conforms to the founding principles of course). reply throwboatyface 10 hours agorootparentprevChevron Reference is the idea that when a statute is ambiguous the agencies can interpret it according to their expert opinion. The alternative is requiring Congress to write every single rule explicitly and pass a law adapting to any change in circumstance or technology. In practice this means \"no regulation\" because Congress is pretty slow and adding more detail would only make them slower. reply dantheman 7 hours agorootparentAll that has to happen is the agency propose a set of rules and let congress vote. If they can't get it through congress then it should be a rule. reply yellow_postit 2 hours agorootparentIt’s unworkably dysfunctional for “everything” to have to go through congress. If and when agencies overstep that gets resolved through legal challenges. reply tristan957 9 hours agorootparentprevMany of these regulatory agencies were created by Congress, of my limited knowledge on the subject is to be believed. reply semiquaver 9 hours agorootparentprevNonsense. The law in question explicitly grants the FCC the right to make this determination via regulation. > The Commission shall prescribe regulations to implement the requirements of this subsection. In implementing the requirements of this subsection, the Commission — (A) shall consider prescribing regulations to allow businesses to avoid receiving calls made using an artificial or prerecorded voice to which they have not given their prior express consent; […] Chevron deference is about whose interpretation governs when a law is ambiguous; that’s not even close to being the case here. reply unethical_ban 10 hours agorootparentprevExecutive agencies are granted authority by the legislature. The legislature can at any time make additional legislation overriding or limiting specific actions taken by executive agencies. It isn't made up. reply AtlasBarfed 9 hours agorootparentprevWho will think of the poor corporations and their armies of on-retainer lawyers? Of course government is incompetent and can't be reasonable in regulation? Is that the idea? How dare these corporations not be given minutely detailed regulations that they can easily tear apart to pollute to their convenience? You mean you want REASON in government and regulation? reply NotSammyHagar 9 hours agoparentprevIt will cause chaos and disaster if congress has to make regulations for every little thing. Congress is so divided the result of Chevron reversal is that huge numbers of usefully regulated utilities, companies, etc will be unregulated. It also doesn't make sense for congress to spend all their time writing regulations, they'd get even less done. Congress can barely pass a budget shortly before the previous budget year ends. Ending the ability of federal agencies to write useful regulations means unregulated spam robocalls! It's the dream of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. Rich people are unbounded. They would say we don't need regulations about food safety written by those ninnys in the federal government. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 7 hours agorootparentYes. Heavens forfend if they had to do the job they asked to be elected to do. In short, good. How many here can even map the entire list of all the agencies and corresponding rules, recommendations, and guidance that has the weight of law.a committee of leading experts from the private sector and the advocacy side of any given subject matter weigh in yearly on any topic before regulations can be changed This is part of the design of regulatory agencies. Rulings like this come after an extensive process of consultation and public comment. reply epistasis 9 hours agorootparentprevCurtailing the power of government means upholding the Chevron Deference, obviously. If every little thing now becomes an open question of law, we exist in a vacuum of power where courts arbitrarily decide all sorts of things, giving massive amounts of power to the government. Uncertainty breeds timidness. In order for people to have freedom to act, they need to know in advance what is legal and what is not. reply jprete 7 hours agorootparentprevThe private sector has demonstrated a thousand times over that they're bad-faith actors. reply gustavus 6 hours agorootparentThe government is also just as much bad actors whenever [insert whatever side you are opposed to] is in power. reply throwaway2037 9 hours agorootparentprevI agree with your post. If you step back, can there be any highly developed countries that do not have the equivalent of the Chevron Deference? It seems impossible. Else, parliament would spend all of its time updating laws to add new corner cases that industry/people exploit. It would be very inefficient. To be very specific: For each new chemical discovered or manuf'd, environmental protection laws would need to be amended by parliament. It is madness to think about. reply TravisCooper 9 hours agorootparentprevThey should make recommendations, and then before anything goes into effect, these recommendations must be passed into law (Congress passes bill, President signs it). They could bundle these up regularly. reply BriggyDwiggs42 9 hours agorootparentWhy is that better than the current system? reply tw04 9 hours agorootparentprev>Congress should have gotten off their hands and written something by now, same with Crypto legislation. “Chevron Deference” breeds tyranny through legislative apathy It would be literally impossible for congress to rule on every nuanced thing that Chevron allows agencies to do. Saying \"congress should take care of it\" shows either an intentional disregard for the roles agencies and their experts play, or a complete misunderstanding of the power it grants to federal agencies. \"It breeds tyranny\" is absolutely ridiculous. When agencies rule in a manner people find unjust, they sue and win or lose in a court of law based on the content of the policy. It also gives congress a chance to rule on \"big ticket\" things that do need addressing without causing an absolute standstill having to rule on something as mundane as what the legal weight and length limit should be each season for catching a salmon from federal land in Montana. reply mullingitover 11 hours agorootparentprevIt's by design. Legislators aren't and can't be competent regulators, and they know this. Congress can't even handle managing fiscal policy sanely, and that's the one job they can't delegate. reply EasyMark 8 hours agorootparentlook no further than the recent border bill that got the \"no not like that, it wasn't supposed to work\". Now they have to answer for it in november, a major piece of legislation in their favor and they left it on the floor because the maniac running the party has hurt feelings on not being included. reply skybrian 11 hours agorootparentprevFrom a practical point of view, it's hard to say whether Congress would make better or worse decisions, and it's probably good that the government can make decisions about new technologies while Congress is mostly dysfunctional. Maybe the thing that guards against tyranny is that Congress can override them (by passing a law) if regulators screw up badly enough? At least, in theory. Just like, in theory, the people could elect a better Congress. reply ortusdux 9 hours agorootparentprevCongress did act. They passed the TCPA in 1991 knowing full well that Chevron deference would allow the FCC to tweak their interpretation of the law as facts change. Congress doesn't want to have to micromanage things like this. If they did they would write the laws in a way that prevents situations where Chevron comes into play. And anyway, getting rid of Chevron would transfer the agencies powers to the courts, not congress. reply djur 9 hours agorootparentThe language of the bill here, \"artificial or prerecorded voice\" isn't even ambiguous to a normal person. An AI agent's voice is undeniably \"artificial\". It'd be a much bigger stretch for the FCC to interpret it otherwise! reply bloppe 10 hours agorootparentprevSaying \"Congress should\" is basically abdicating solving the problem reply drawkward 9 hours agorootparentprevHave you listened to our congresspeople? Nothing they do or say suggests to me that they have the capabilities to legislate effectively on technical matters, be they AI, Pollution or Food Safety. We have departments that have traditionally been staffed with SMEs to make these rulings and decisions on behalf of congress, who legislates their existence and budget. reply cancerhacker 8 hours agorootparentWith some sarcasm and much trepidation, I would submit that lobbyists would be more than happy to write the laws that their congresspeople will sign into law, ending the due diligence and oversight of qualified, established government departments. (I know they do this now, but think of how much worse it could be!) reply pdntspa 9 hours agorootparentprevLooks like someone doesn't give a shit about shared resources or tragedies of the commons, and wants to do away with important regulation... reply BriggyDwiggs42 9 hours agorootparentprevCongress can’t reasonably be expected to rule on everything, nor are they equipped with the expertise to do so. reply EasyMark 8 hours agorootparentprevthere is simply no way for congress to enact every regulation. This is all a power grab for corporations bankrolling republican judges and congress critters to be able to ignore any regulations they want in order to make a few more bucks. reply unethical_ban 10 hours agorootparentprevOur country is falling apart because of the current level of congressional ineptitude. One party refuses to support important legislation they specifically asked for because it may give the opposition party a positive news article. Wishing the Congress had to study and pass legislation for all enforcement and regulation of society is tantamount to accelerationism. reply godzillabrennus 9 hours agorootparentThe border bill was not what the GOP was asking for.

When a call comes in as a number instead of a name, I simply decline to pick it up. If it's not a spam call, they will either leave a voice message or send a text.

If the concept of a phone was never invented, and nobody knew what one was, and then suddenly here in 2024, an app company invented an app where: - The user could type in a N digit number and hit a button... - This would cause another user's device to instantly stop doing what it was doing. ring and buzz with a modal popup window... - With no authentication whatsoever or often even no identification... - And then if that other user pushed a button, it allowed the initial user to be able to instantly start sending them voice This thing would never make it past any app store's guidelines, and would likely be unacceptable to users.

Yes it is... physical space is shaped to keep most people from being able to interrupt you. Being able to call anyone around the world changed that. reply csallen 9 hours agorootparentWhat common physical space keeps people from interrupting you? - I had my own room as a kid. My parents and brother banged on the door whenever they pleased. - I worked at a tech company, had my own desk, and wore headphones. Coworkers still sent me Slack messages and tapped me on my shoulder. - I've lived in a home in the burbs. People came to my home and rang the bell. None of them were hard for the interruptor to do, and all of them happened frequently. In fact, I would argue that they are more frequent than the number of phone calls I get nowadays, which are actually easy much easier to screen/ignore than any of the above interruptions. reply jamilton 7 hours agorootparentI think their point is in physical space, dozens to maybe thousands of people (if there's a lot of people around you, I guess?) can easily interrupt you at any given moment. With phones and things like Slack, hypothetically anyone near a phone can interrupt you if you're near your phone. Which people usually keep near them. I would say depending on how bad someone has it they could get 1 to 3 spam calls a day, I assume if someone was getting consistently more than that they'd use a screener to lower it. That's a significant amount. reply csallen 7 hours agorootparentIn all of the places named above, people have interrupted me more than once a day, and I don't think that's abnormal. And again, it's much easier and less rude to put my phone on silent for unknown numbers, than it is to ignore a coworker/friend/neighbor/partner/child who's trying to get my attention, or even a stranger at my door. I'm not here defending spam calls. They are annoying AF. Nor do I disagree that hypothetically more people on Earth have access to us than ever before. Of course they do.

When you greet someone physically you can add each other as known trusted contacts immediately. And when you sign up to some service online and have to put in your contact info, which likewise prompts you to add them as contact. And you can't share along a contact you know to someone else without that contact ID uniquely identifying you. That way, everyone who should contact you can do so and if someone else gets their hand on your contact info you can figure out who leaked it. reply sspiff 13 hours agorootparentI do this with my email. I have a bunch of different emails under my own domain, and I use info+uniqueidentifier@domain.org for registrations which do not warrant their own actual email handle. This way, I can easily filter incoming email, and I can see where an email came from if any party sells my data. This also works with GMail by the way, you can use youraccount+anyrandomstring@gmail.com and emails will still be delivered to you. I use a separate email handle that I only hand out to actual human beings, never to companies and never use for account registrations. This has worked really well for the past 15 years or so. reply jowea 12 hours agorootparentI heard about the +, but don't some sites reject it? Or can't bad actors just strip it? You'd need your own domain with a large amount of unique identifiers for it to work if it became popular. reply heleninboodler 12 hours agorootparentI find it quite rare for systems to reject the + these days. One notable exception is my credit union, whose Web 1.0 system turned it into a space. The most annoying thing about this practice is if you're telling it to a human, they are very confused about your email address having their company's name in it. I occasionally get \"do you work here or something?\" Every once in a while I'm talking to someone (example: elementary school secretary) who gives me a vibe that they're going to be really thrown off by this and I just make up a three letter unique code for a suffix since I can still search for whoever sent me that first to see what the suffix means. On the stripping of the + and suffix, yeah, bad actors who recognize your scheme can do that, but spamming is about quantity, not quality, so they just aren't going to put in the effort. reply jowea 10 hours agorootparentSpamming is about quantity but stripping a \"+\" is something a one line script can do, which is what will happen if this gets popular. A real solution should be more resilient. Like spam binning anything that does not use the \"+\" ? reply nunez 10 hours agorootparentprevunfortunately, i disagree; i stopped using plus sign addressing because so many sites i wanted to use it on (many of them for important things like medical stuff) wouldn't accept it reply jrockway 12 hours agorootparentprevI still miss qmail's convention, which used a - instead. That worked flawlessly everywhere, circa early 2000s. (I still have some email handling rules for my domain that understand the - aliases I created.) I think that both conventions are flawed, as adversaries that know the convention can just remove the distinguishing part. If someone signs up with the email address real+spam@example.com, then they're just going to spam real@example.com. Apple's thing where it creates a987dfc429be@icloud.com is much better. Maybe that's the username I selected. Maybe it's an anti-spam forwarding address. There is no way of knowing. (Actually, I think it does something like relay.icloud.com? So yeah, they know it's not your real address. Apple just says \"if you reject this, you can't have an iPhone app\", which is what makes it work.) reply notpushkin 10 hours agorootparentA certain tongue-in-cheek email provider [0] uses . (a dot) for this purpose, i.e. username.anything@domain.tld. Spammers could remove the distinguishing part here too, but they can't be bothered to keep a list of all the conventions used by different providers, so I think it should work pretty well. (Personally I use a dedicated catch-all domain now, and the username is the distinguishing part – try to remove that!) [0]: https://cock.li/, they do have SFW domains though reply jowea 10 hours agorootparentprevFollowing my navel gazing idea, the trick is that mail to real@example.com just gets spam binned automatically. Anyone who has any business emailing your should have an real+randomuniqueid@example.com email address to send to you. It's almost like the randomuniqueid is a password to your inbox. Unfortunately, this is only for email no such thing for phones or anything. reply jrockway 2 hours agorootparentI like that! reply seadan83 3 hours agorootparentprevNot all mail servers treat a+b@a.com and a@a.com as the same email. By equal token, you can't be sure that the email address doesn't actually just contain a plus sign. I was disappointed to find out at work recently that the plus convention was not configured. It made testing account signups more difficult. This is when I dug in a bit and found it that it depends in the mail server for whether those are unique addresses or not. reply FireBeyond 7 hours agorootparentprev> Apple's thing where it creates a987dfc429be@icloud.com Still trivial to detect. Random letter/number combinations, letter combinations that don't exist in the dictionary, no dictionary word?

No “+” convention, it just generates a random @icloud.com email address specifically for whatever website/app you’re signing up for, and forwards it to your real email. The random addresses are indistinguishable from real iCloud.com email addresses, there’s no naming convention a website can reject. I never worry about sites that require signups any more, I just autogenerate an email for them and use a fake name. I couldn’t give a shit less if they get hacked or leak data, because the email and password are randomly generated. If they turn out to spam me I just disable that email address and never hear from them again. The only people who have my “real” email addresses are people I know personally. reply hsshah 7 hours agorootparentHave you ever had to reply 'from' a random iCloud email? Is it possible?

Was a pain. reply FireBeyond 8 hours agorootparentprev> The random addresses are indistinguishable from real iCloud.com email addresses, there’s no naming convention a website can reject. That's not remotely true. The very very very vast majority of actual iCloud email addresses are going to have \"dictionary\" names. It's quite trivial to detect a randomized address (and at that point, you probably don't even care about a couple of false positives). Multiple instances of letter-number-letter-number (\"b2y4r\")? Coupled with letter combinations that don't exist in most languages (\"ytbn\")? And no dictionary words (\"john\", \"smith\", \"booklover\")? Random address. Now, whether you care to do business with someone who detects this is a different question altogether. But they are absolutely distinguishable. reply ninkendo 7 hours agorootparentThe auto-generated addresses also have dictionary names. They’re explicitly designed to look like addresses that a real person might come up with… typically a dictionary word, followed by some numbers and symbols. Just like other email addresses on popular services where all the good names are taken. reply FireBeyond 7 hours agorootparentThe ones I've seen are like a987dfc429be@icloud.com.

And maybe have a way to to send a request that someone add you to their contacts, that would be processed differently than a normal message. reply dghlsakjg 12 hours agorootparentThat eliminates a huge class of genuinely useful use cases for email.

It was my electric company, something had gone wrong with a payment. They have my email address, they send me txts all the time, but apparently collections is still making phone calls. Had to be the dumbest thing I'd seen.

I mean: I think it is perfectly OK to have a policy that requires real people to make real phone calls for some things -- especially things that might not fit into automated systems. But I think it's very bizarre that these real people would not also leave a voicemail message stating the purpose of the call. (There's tons of reasons for people to not answer the phone that extend beyond screening unknown numbers.

I also find that whenever you're shopping for big-ticket items that involve salespeople and soliciting multiple bids, you have to forego your \"don't pick up the phone for unknown numbers\" policy. I now just pick up and say \"hello?\" and count off two seconds. If I don't hear a response within that time I hang up.

The only issue is that a friend once listed me as their emergency contact for a gym membership, but then the gym made telemarketing calls to me with it. There should be federal law protecting emergency contact numbers from being shared or used for any reason except an emergency. Alternative method might be to set up a Twilio workflow that says \"Press 1 to reach me\" and only forward to your actual phone after that. That will probably eliminate all the robocallers but not the human telemarketers reply petsfed 12 hours agorootparentprevI've had a disturbingly large number of repeat calls from people who absolutely refuse to leave a message.

The problem is that if I'm getting repeated calls from an unrecognized number, I'm assuming my wife, my kids, or my parents are in an ambulance, so I have to drop everything and answer. As a rule of thumb, if I get a one-off call that doesn't leave a message, I'll search my email inbox for that number, as they've probably contacted me separately. However, one time, I got called 5 times in 90 minutes, with the only message being 23 seconds of silence, and an email I hadn't even read yet (searching the number brought up the email).

I’ve had doctors call me with results and the only way I could get ahold of them was to call, pretend I had a billing issue to get to some human, then try to convince them to connect me to the person who just called me not 5 minutes ago. reply yreg 12 hours agorootparentprevI do the same, but even the legitimate callers never seem to leave a voicemail or send a text message. I have missed deliveries or other important things due to my policy. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentprevYup, same. I'll make an exception if I'm expecting an important call but aren't sure of what number it's going to come from. This is rare enough that it doesn't bother me much. And now that some calls are SHAKEN/STIR-verified, with a caller ID, I can often have good confidence before I pick up that it's actually the call I'm waiting for. reply solardev 7 hours agorootparentprevOn Pixel phones (or was it Google Fi? can't remember), this is automatic. If it's not someone in my contact list already, known spam gets auto blocked and everyone else gets redirects to the voice assistant that takes a message and transcribes it.

I switched back to Android shortly after. reply TinyRick 13 hours agorootparentprevI do exactly this but take it even one step further.

If I do pick up an unknown number because I am expecting something, I usually press speaker and mute and just wait. If it's a person, I'll get an awkward Hello?

This kind of problem needs to be solved at the root cause, say if the phone companies could be made to pay a bit when you get spammed and forced to recover their costs from the spammers the issue would be solved, now if they profit the issue will get larger and alrger. reply smaudet 13 hours agorootparentFor this type of case it would be ideal if you could give him a passcode.

If you don't pick up, you won't realize that your stolen car has been recovered a couple miles from your house, and if you show up there in 30 minutes you can drive it back home, but if you don't, the police will send it to a towing yard, which will require you to go through 24 hours of paperwork with the police to obtain a release and then pay the towing yard $1,000+ to tow and store your car. If you live in an area of low crime, though, maybe it'll be fine not to answer phone calls from numbers that aren't in your phone. reply ryandvm 13 hours agorootparentMan, that is the most edge case reason I've ever heard for answering anonymous calls. reply smaudet 13 hours agorootparentMedical calls are another, strangers finding your lost stuff is a third. I'm probably forgetting more. Biggest reason - voicemail. Most numbers have a mailbox limit, it's somewhat common to reach a number that has a full mailbox.

A one or two minute delay is almost never going to cause an issue. Even in the highest crime areas the ratio of spam calls to legit and urgent calls is going to be thousands to one. You can cumulatively save a lot of time and annoyance by not answering all of those spam calls.

It transcribes the conversations on my phone in real-time, and I can push a few buttons to tell to bot what to say--things like \"tell me more\", or \"please tell me why you're calling\". If the entity calling gives an explanation I care about, then I can press a button and the bot says \"thanks, connecting you now\" and then I can say \"hello\" with my own voice and have a normal conversation. I think most people think it's just a fancy answering machine, they don't realize I'm controlling it. Voice calls are on the decline anyway, but I think it's becoming possible to have a very sophisticated AI secretary answer calls for you, even beyond what I've explained Google is doing. Imagine being able to give your LLM phone secretary a prompt and it would answer calls for you. You could tell it something like \"the snowblower I listed in the classifieds is already sold\" and maybe it could automatically resolve some calls or text messages for you. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentI have the same phone and feature. My experience is that everyone always hangs up immediately after facing the screener. I'd love to actually use this feature, I mean hell, I can fucking text responses to them and read what they say through it! But I never can in a realistic setting because people hear robot and hang up. I've been eagerly waiting Apple's release so that the feature becomes more well known. Google really dropped the ball on advertising and honestly I think should have just pushed it to all Android phones because you need to change how people interact. I've worried it would go away because Google deems it \"useless\" despite its uselessness being that the feature is just not known. There's just too few Pixel phones so people aren't experiencing the screener and so act like a normal human being and go \"robot? Ugh, fuck that\" and associate this with calling a 1 800 number. reply Buttons840 14 hours agorootparentYeah, most people hang up immediately, mission accomplished probably. Sometimes the doctors office calls and awkwardly starts leaving a full fledged message rather than just saying their name (like the bot tells them to), then, when I press the answer button the bot interrupts them and we start a normal phone call. In fairness, it may be awkward, but it doesn't waste the caller's time, none of the robot messages are long, and people are quickly able to say their name and why they're calling. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentMy experience is more them just hanging up. Including the doctor's office. A funny case was my friend used me as a reference for a security clearance. They called, skipped to voicemail, I immediately call back to find a busy line, I leave a message, then I get a call back the next day from a new number in which I now need to just answer any unknown number. That's also happened with doctors and other offices, so it completely undermines the feature for me. Yeah, it helps with robocallers, but the DNC list does a better job. The feature has a ton of potential though, I just think it is useless if it doesn't enter the public lexicon. I've never had the experience you've had where they start to leave a message. Maybe because I don't live in The Bay? Idk. They either just hang up or go to voicemail. Which always results in the game of phone tag. So not only was mission __not__ accomplished, but the mission difficulty increased. reply bee_rider 12 hours agorootparentI wonder what attenuation is applied to the security clearance system, if it is only reaching the sort of maniac (jk. Kinda.) who manually answers their calls, haha. reply itishappy 13 hours agorootparentprev> My experience is that everyone always hangs up immediately after facing the screener. Working as intended! This isn't a new process, answering machines and operators have been around for ages. If your information is important, leave a message. If you're unwilling to leave a message, text. If you're unwilling to leave a message or text, it wasn't important. reply davchana 13 hours agorootparentBut sometimes the person calling you is calling 300 people for something not important to him, but super important to you. Like power utility payments. If he can't reach you, and decides to leave no message, he himself personally is not much inconvenienced, but your account affects you. reply archon810 3 hours agorootparentprevMy experience with Call Screen is actually very positive. It screens tons of spam calls and legitimate people who are actually calling for me do talk to my robot assistant, I get a quick transcription, and I pick up. It's why I can't quit Google's Pixels. Maybe it's regional, I'm in the Bay Area, and people are used to it here by now. reply godelski 2 hours agorootparent> Maybe it's regional, I'm in the Bay Area, and people are used to it here by now. I was actually wondering this too. Bay Area is a bubble of its own.

You're right in that it never is really that important, but that's true in the same sense that most calls aren't important. Either way, I don't end up knowing but if I responded I'd spend less time dealing with whatever it is. (Good god, can people just leave proper fucking messages? Say why you called! And don't get me started with texts or slack messages that are like \"hey\" or \"we need to talk\" and nothing else... types \"hey\" in slack. Asked what they want. Refuses to elaborate.

A person claiming to be a Comcast rep called, introduced themselves, asked if I was me, and then immediately hung up as soon as I made a noise. It is possible they just hung up because I was already a little skeptical and feeling cagey, so didn’t give an enthusiastic “yeah that’s me.” Anyway, I’ve never been called for something that benefits me. So, hopefully every company that depends on cold-calling will go out of business soon as everyone younger than, like, halfway through gen X doesn’t pick up their phone anymore. reply coldpie 14 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, I get these, too.

The calls are just one of the early gates, as someone screening your call is likely not to fall for the eventual scam. The gates don’t have to be clever for this to work.

    "originBody": "LEADERSHIP ·TECHNOLOGY Exclusive: Mozilla names new CEO as it pivots to data privacy BYDIANE BRADY Mozilla has named a new CEO effective immediately. SANTIAGO MEJIA—SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE/GETTY IMAGES Mozilla Corp., which manages the open-source Firefox browser, announced today that Mitchell Baker is stepping down as CEO to focus on AI and internet safety as chair of the nonprofit foundation. Laura Chambers, a Mozilla board member and entrepreneur with experience at Airbnb, PayPal, and eBay, will step in as interim CEO to run operations until a permanent replacement is found. Baker, a Silicon Valley pioneer who cofounded the Mozilla Project, says it was her decision to step down as CEO, adding that the move is motivated by a sense of urgency over the current state of the internet and public trust. “We want to offer an alternative for people to have better products,” says Baker, who wants to draw more attention to policies, products, and processes to challenge business models built on fueling outrage. “What are the connections between this global malaise and how humans are engaging with each other and technology?” Chambers says she plans to focus on building out new products that address growing privacy concerns while actively looking for a full-time CEO. Prior to being recruited to the Mozilla board three years ago, Chambers says she was feeling “pretty disillusioned” about society because of the influence of money in politics and the growing power of the tech giants. “I was confused about what to do, and this felt like a genuine way to make an impact.” Chambers says she won’t be seeking a permanent CEO role, because she plans to move back to Australia later this year for family reasons. “I think this is an example of Mozilla doing the right role-modeling in how to manage a succession,” says Chambers. The move comes at a time when Mozilla has no choice but to reimagine its role in a world dominated by Big Tech and AI. Firefox, which launched 20 years ago to challenge the dominance of Internet Explorer and once accounted for more than 30% of the global browser market, has shrunk to low single digits in a world dominated by Google Chrome. Mozilla generates revenue through search partnerships, a majority of which come from Google. But AI has given the nonprofit foundation and its cofounder Baker a fresh sense of mission in creating alternatives to tackle deepfakes, data privacy issues, and the power of Big Tech. It launched a Mozilla.ai startup last year and Mozilla Corp. is focused on product extensions like Mozilla Monitor that wipe subscribers’ data off the web. For Baker, success is about influencing the conversation and giving consumers, as well as developers, a meaningful choice in how they operate online. “Our goal is to build something different,” she says, “business models with some societal purpose and public benefit” that give users meaningful control over their data. “The qualities of online life can be improved.” Subscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive navigate the changing needs of the workplace.

I was very low in the company, but for some reason sent Mitchell an email detailing why I thought it was a bad idea. She not only responded in a very gracious way, but also followed up months later to check if my feelings had changed. While they had not, she didn't owe me anything and I really appreciated her attentiveness. Mitchell really cares about Mozilla and its community. Mitchell was a great community leader. That doesn't always translate to being a good CEO or leader of a business, however Mitchell is a huge reason (if not THE reason) why we have Firefox today – and, even if you don't currently use Firefox, a huge reason why we have the web we have today. So, while I haven't been the biggest fan of Mozilla's decisions the past few years, I do want to give credit to Mitchell for everything she did for the open web and open source. She was a supporter before anyone really cared, and played a huge part in getting is to where we are now over the past 20+ years. (I am glad this is the direction they have chosen! Here's a 2015 post where I write about how I think Mozilla should focus on data privacy: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10698997) reply lolinder 17 hours agoparentIt's interesting to hear this, because from the outside Mitchell's tenure has seemed to be a disaster, with a complete inability to stay focused on one thing for long enough to make a difference. Mozilla in recent memory has reminded me more than anything of the dogs in Pixar's Up (\"squirrel!\"), constantly chasing after the latest shiny tech fad while neglecting the fundamentals. They've been a follower on everything and have failed to lead on anything. Mitchell's justification for stepping down as CEO seems to me to follow this same pattern: she's stepping down in order to focus on AI and internet safety. It's good to know that she's a decent person and was good to Mozilla employees, but it's hard to square the picture you paint with the complete lack of direction I've seen during her tenure. Maybe Mozilla was in a much worse situation than I thought at the time she took the position? reply gkoberger 17 hours agorootparentI agree with everything you said. All I can say in response is that being a great community leader and open web advocate doesn't always square with someone who has to make a profit for hundreds or thousands of employees. I have no inside information, but here's my guess at what happened. John Lilly was a great CEO. When he left, there was a gigantic void. They hired Gary Kovacs, who started the \"squirrel!\"-ing. He wasn't well-liked, and used Mozilla as a stepping stone. So going forward they only hired from the Mozilla community, which is a small pool – both of people who could do it and people who wanted to do it. I'm not sure if Mitchell wanted it or not, but I don't think there was a lot of competition. Being the CEO of Mozilla is not a good job, and I imagine it's really hard to fill. There's a ton of pressure, relatively low salary, no equity, no exit. reply animal_spirits 17 hours agorootparentMitchell baker was making 6.2 million dollars a year at Mozilla in 2023. Source: https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2024/01/02/mozilla_in_2024_a... reply gkoberger 17 hours agorootparentYes, that's a lot of money. But if you're a CEO good enough to turn Mozilla around given the constraints... you could make a lot more elsewhere. If nothing else, you'd get stock, which would correlate with your performance. reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentFor a company that has a declining marketshare like Mozilla it's really way too high IMO. Her salary kept going up as the marketshare was going down... reply Certhas 47 minutes agorootparentThis line is trotted out all the time... but her salary also was going up as revenues and earnings kept going up. From 2005 to 2022 revenues grew more than 10 fold, from 52M$ to 593M$. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation https://frankhecker.com/2020/08/13/mozillas-uncertain-future... In recent years, the proportion coming from Google has also been coming down (even if slowly, from 90+% to just above 80%), and considerable cash reserves have been built up. Her compensation is ahead of the median for companies in the 0.1-1 billion revenue range, but in line with the median CEO compensation for a company with 1-5 billion in revenues: https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/10/07/ceo-and-executive... https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/F... So if you accept that this is an unusually complex CEO role, then it does not seems disproportionate (when judged relative to the absurd disproportionate growth of CEO compensation overall). reply withoutboats3 18 minutes agorootparentHer salary began increasing in the late 2010s, when the annual revenue was already around 500 million. Her salary did not grow in step with revenue, her salary grew after revenue stopped increasing & market share had long been declining. I'm not sure if you're being disingenuous by citing growth since 2005. > In recent years, the proportion coming from Google has also been coming down (even if slowly, from 90+% to just above 80%), and considerable cash reserves have been built up. Instead of building cash reserves and laying off engineers, Mozilla could have invested that money in Firefox. Could it have successfully turned around? Maybe not, but we'll never know. It's basically a question of whether you believe Mozilla's mission is best served by building Firefox or by continuing to exist once Firefox no longer exists, and whether its appropriate then for the foundation chair & CEO to be pulling a 7 figure compensation out of a declining non profit. It's obvious the leadership believes the Mozilla Foundation needs to outlive Firefox, but from my perspective the Mozilla Foundation's influence and significance will be nil without browser marketshare. reply bradly 12 hours agorootparentprev> Her salary kept going up as the marketshare was going down... You'd really need to decide if you thought their marketshare would go down faster or not with someone else. reply stephen_g 6 hours agorootparentThat’s irrelevant. People were starting to see alarm bells ringing when her salary had quadrupled to $2.5m (this is in 2018 or 2019 I think?) while market share was dropping, it should have stayed basically around there until she turned things around with an increase as an incentive. Instead it doubled and then increased again (wasn’t it more like $7m by the end?) reply p-e-w 5 hours agorootparentAnd someone said yes to that. Think about that for a second. The product's global importance is now a tiny fraction of what it was 15 years ago, and the person during whose tenure this happened was recently making 10x as much as back then. TEN TIMES. And whoever approved that obscene compensation thought this was a good idea. reply Certhas 40 minutes agorootparentMozilla is also making 10x as much revenue as 15 years ago, has massively increased cash reserves, and is finally starting to diversify its income streams. And it's absurd to put the fault for the declining market share purely at the feet of Mozillas leadership. Not to say they were blameless, but when Google threw its weight behind Chrome, including massive ad campaigns on billboards, pushing it on its web properties, and regularly breaking Firefox on their own websites for no technical reasons, you can't reasonably expect Firefox to just magically maintain their market share. That said, at the upper end you could look at Germany, where Firefox is still between 10-20% (depending on the estimate you look at), as what could have been achievable more broadly. reply archerx 1 hour agorootparentprevIt’s almost parasitic, suck the host of it’s resources and dump it when it’s near death for the next host... I used to be a big Firefox fan, but the last 10 years made me abandon it, I don’t even check if my sites work on it anymore because the market share it has is so tiny. My time is better spent making sure it works with Safari... reply roenxi 9 hours agorootparentprevIf Firefox is destined for a market share of 2%, may as well get there quickly. A few years of decline vs a few months makes little difference in the long term. To be honest, market share shouldn't ever have been Baker's goal and losing it isn't necessarily a black mark against her. Firefox should have a vision of what it wants a browser and the internet to look like and be working to make software that supports that. Firefox seems to just be following along as Chrome with some minor tweaks [0] and that is the real problem. Google's vision of the internet is not what Firefox should be working to implement. There are deep strategic issues here that go far beyond market share. I'm personally happy to use niche software, I don't care what other people are using (Linux reached my desktop a long time ago). But it is hard to see what even Mozilla thinks the point of Firefox is. One of the things that makes Brave interesting to me is that it sees a web where middle men get cut out through the use of cryptocurrency. Is that going to work? Probably not. But it is a different take on what the internet could be. We need competitors like that. Even for privacy; it is hard to tell who Mozilla thinks the internet should look like. I'd hazard little change from now except without 3rd party cookies. That isn't a very impressive vision. [0] https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/compare/chrom... reply geoelectric 9 hours agorootparentMarket share was/is a means to an end. Mozilla positioned Firefox in part as a reference for how web standards should behave (*), particularly for ones where Chrome/IE/Safari diverged with competing non-standard implementations. But for that to work in the real world, not just at W3C debates, you need major websites to care if they function correctly on your browser. And for them to care, enough people have to be using your browser that these companies see a business case for spending money to add your browser to project plans and QA test matrixes as a compatibility target. That decision is heavily informed by market share, whether global or as a percentage of the site’s own access records. In particular, double digits is a rough threshold for that, and that was pretty much Mozilla’s target. 50% would be wonderful but 10%+ let them assert standards in the ecosystem via the implicit threat of users leaving a site if Firefox didn’t work. As a test professional at the time, one of the most discouraging things I saw after leaving Mozilla was Firefox dropping off all the test plans I knew about when they hit single digits. I’d poke at that decision where I had influence, and would basically get back a response that “Firefox is dead, just look at the numbers.” (*) I’m pointedly ignoring some of the more aggressive introductions of things like device-interface APIs crucial to making a browser engine act like a phone OS, etc. Ultimately, someone has to build a working implementation before it’ll become a standard, anyway. There’s a race aspect for new ground and Mozilla was part of that. But generally speaking, where there was an actual recognized standard, Firefox used it and not some homegrown alternative. So websites also had to develop to that standard to function correctly for a significant percentage of users. reply ricardobayes 1 hour agorootparentprevFirefox is a pretty good browser, I wonder what caused people to switch. reply AnthonyMouse 27 minutes agorootparentFirefox isn't the default browser on any of the popular consumer operating systems, so people don't need a reason to switch from it, they need a reason to switch to it. Which Mozilla could provide if they'd spend more resources on Firefox and less on random tangents. But now Google is doing their work for them by making Chrome worse: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-l... reply Certhas 36 minutes agorootparentprevGoogle ad campaigns, some years where Chrome genuinely felt snappier, Google pushing Chrome everywhere, Google sabotaging Firefox on their own websites. Generally speaking, we have seen that people are okay with handing over the web and all their data to Google, if a button press registers 20ms faster. reply foofie 2 hours agorootparentprev> If Firefox is destined for a market share of 2%, may as well get there quickly. A few years of decline vs a few months makes little difference in the long term. How does that play into your decision to use Firefox or any other browser? I'm a Firefox user and I care nothing about market share. I get annoyed if I stumble upon a page managed by incompetent devteams and thus only runs on Chrome, but that's a quick in-and-out. Why do you care about share? Why do you feel it's relevant, specially if people are pushed to use Chrome or Edge through unethical means? reply archerx 1 hour agorootparentAs a developer the lower the market share the less incentive there is to supporting it. I have stopped testing to see if my sites work on firefox and just focus on chromium and safari. A few years ago Firefox was my main browser and I got sick of the constant changes and just use chrome, brave and safari now. I never missed FF for one moment. I remember when Firefox was the faster leaner version of the mozilla browser and now they have bloated it up and forgotten its foundational principles. reply bbor 8 hours agorootparentprevGreat, informative comment. Thank you. I think this whole discussion of market share smacks a little too much of evaluating a president by the country’s GDP. Useful for a pithy remark, but doing any sort of detailed analysis seems doomed. I think the factors you listed are far more relevant reply wkat4242 10 hours agorootparentprevEven still. These two trends can't be reconciled. With the marketshare the importance of the role also drops. In 10 years she'd be making 100M per year and have 100 customers :P reply bradly 10 hours agorootparentI know nothing of this person or Mozilla internals, but I could imagine a company heading towards bankruptcy, that was avoided while still losing market-share. In this situation the role of CEO could become more important as market-share decreases and the situation becomes more precarious. Now if that person caused the downward slide to begin with, that's a different conversation. Again, I don't know the internals of Mozilla well enough to make an educated argument one way or the other. reply foofie 2 hours agorootparentprev> For a company that has a declining marketshare like Mozilla it's really way too high IMO. Everyone talks a lot about market share but I never saw the breakdown of the market in terms of what is actually reporting the user agent. For example, both Chrome and Edge provide embeddable webviews used by applications to put together their GUIs, while Firefox doesn't. Other competitors such as Microsoft also pushes Edge very aggressively in a way that to me seems ethically questionable. Chrome leverages Google's control over some apps and features to be pretty much the only browser that is able to render some pages. To me, Firefox is undoubtedly the best browser out there, and the only reason I see people use any other browser is inertia and not having control over their OS to change defaults. So what's the argument on market share? reply bawolff 15 hours agorootparentprevI mean, being a succesful ceo at a declining company is much harder than being one at a growing company. At a growing company you just have to not screw up, and a declining company you have to actually turn things around. It doesn't seem totally unreasonable to get higher pay doing a harder job (presuming she is actually good at her job) reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentGiven that nothing has turned around, it's hard to point to any evidence that she's doing a good job. The best she can claim is that had anyone else been CEO things would have declined even faster, and that's not something anyone can prove. reply bee_rider 11 hours agorootparentWhat more do people want at this time? She’s quitting. Now we can see how the next CEO somehow manages to defeat the multiple massive anti-competitive behemoths Mozilla is up against. reply AndrewKemendo 10 hours agorootparentWe just want to not be gaslit into believing that she did a great job, which she clearly didn’t I’m not sure why all the excuses made for her reply swells34 4 hours agorootparentprevI'd like to see her donate half the salary she took back to Mozilla, since she obviously didn't earn it. She doubled her pay several times. Did the engineers doing the work get their pay doubled? No. The only person who did that was the one who was failing in her role. It's actually quite disgusting, just a blatant money grab because no one would stop her. reply bbarnett 9 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if they'll work on the little things. Like text reflow for their mobile browser. We have a massive aging population, and text reflow helps immensely, and only Opera does jt well. reply bamboozled 11 hours agorootparentprevWelcome to Elon Musk at Tesla. reply paledot 11 hours agorootparentI'm no great fan of his (anymore), but Tesla's market share or at least market size did do very well during that period, not to mention the stock price going nuts. And this was all before he took a sharp turn at the corner of alt and right. The controversy is not over whether or not he performed his duties effectively as CEO, it's over the disguised self-dealing that produced the comp package in the first place. The milestones were reasonable, the rewards were not. reply pests 9 hours agorootparentThe rewards were reasonable when they were agreed to. I think the shares were only worth $50 million total. The fact it increased in value so much is the result of him meeting those milestones. Why is that not reasonable. reply anonym29 11 hours agorootparentprevPlease correct me if my understanding is wrong here, but isn't the current situation after the judge nullified his comp package now that he has done a phenomenal job growing the company, has taken $0 in salary for the last 5 years, and is now receiving no stock compensation either? Sure $50bn+ is unreasonably large, but isn't $0 unreasonably small? reply jychang 10 hours agorootparentHe negotiated the $0, that sounds like his problem. If any regular person negotiated an underpaid salary at their job the past 5 years, and then demanded to be paid extra, that would get laughed out of the room. reply anonym29 8 hours agorootparentYes, but he didn't negotiate $0 in a vacuum, I assume he was factoring in the performance-based stock compensation too, in agreeing to take $0, no? He agreed to forgo one type of compensation in favor of another type, that was later yanked away from him under the reasoning that his compensation package was deemed retroactively excessive. I imagine a scenario where I take a slightly lower base pay for a higher number of RSUs, that are only unlocked if I meet my performance goals. I then proceed to meet or exceed these performance goals, as the contractual agreement specified. And then the government, acting on behalf of a shareholder who used to hold 8 shares total, complains that my compensation package was retroactively excessive, even though he hadn't raised this concern earlier. I'd feel unfairly cheated in that scenario, and I can't help but figure Elon probably feels the same way. I know he isn't going to starve to death or anything, but it seems bizarre and worrying to me that it's just perfectly fine to invalidate what was a perfectly fine and legal contract 5 years after it was signed because a minor stakeholder of one party to the contract didn't like the terms. Does this undermine the trustworthiness and stability of executive compensation contracts, or really any compensation contract, broadly in the US? Do I ever need to be worried about getting rug-pulled the way Elon was? I fear this precedent may be abused against \"the little guy\" / the working class in the future. reply pooper 10 hours agorootparentprevUSD 0 is perfectly fine given he owns a lot of TSLA stock already. reply cmcaleer 9 hours agorootparentSee also: Zuck, Jobs, Larry Ellison.

All public company executives need to get their pay package approved by a real board that can actually tell them no (or at least sound like it in the minutes), not a handful of fawning sycophants. Or, if their board is actually a handful of fawning sycophants, they need to not lie about that when describing the pay deal to shareholders. Or they can take their chances on what a judge may think in the future. Doesn't seem unreasonable. reply anonym29 6 hours agorootparentDon't the shareholders elect the board members? reply lmm 5 hours agorootparentUp to a point. Tesla has a staggered board, which is well-known as a technique for making it hard for shareholders to control the board, and in general it's very rare for shareholders to vote board members out even in companies with more shareholder-friendly charters. Support for Tesla's directors in their most recent election was well below the median, partly because ISS had recommended voting against them (which is again unusual), but didn't reach the level of removing them. reply matwood 11 minutes agorootparentprev> How can he know whether the new one will or will not be retroactively invalidated 5 years from now? Get a real board to negotiate and approve the package. Boards and CEOs are already buddy buddy, but this is so far beyond even that.

That's hard enough. Now imagine your market share is down a ton (and decreasing), and there's no clear way to change that trajectory. Then imagine that despite being CEO, you're owned by a non-profit. So, you have a boss, and your boss has different goals than you do. Then imagine attracting and retaining top talent, while not being able to give out equity. Then imagine that your product is free. You can't charge more for it; you give (almost) everything away for free and there's no clear path to monetization. And then imagine that almost all of your money comes from your biggest competitor, and your only lever is to negotiate (from a position of weakness, because they're much bigger) a deal every 3 years in order to keep paying your employees. reply palata 11 hours agorootparentI think that the \"it's paid a lot because it's super hard\" is generally a bad excuse. Many things are super hard, many people make a lot of sacrifices to be among the bests at what they do. Yet they don't earn that much. When the thing you are good at is being a CEO (as opposed to, say, being a teacher), then you are very lucky. Because other CEOs before you managed to make it acceptable to earn an indecent salary for just doing a job. Ok, let's say they don't sleep at all, so they can work 2-3x as much as the average people. Are they paid 2-3x more? No! They're paid orders of magnitudes more. That's indecent. reply Denzel 10 hours agorootparentSo what solution are you proposing? Right now, you’re simply complaining about a perceived problem without offering any logical argument for an alternative. I do not mean to sound flippant, I’d like to hear what your alternative ideas are. reply palata 10 hours agorootparent> So what solution are you proposing? To the problem of human beings receiving way too much money for the time they spend doing their job? Easy: crazy taxes. If the company really wants to increase the salary up to some limit, knowing that 95% of that increase will go into taxes, then good for them. Otherwise they can do something else, like increasing other salaries or hiring people. Also if you ask me, there should be laws for the difference between the lowest and the highest salary in a company. I.e. \"the highest salary cannot be more than X times the lowest salary\". Which means that if the CEO wants to earn more, they need to raise the lowest salaries. reply nemothekid 3 hours agorootparentI'm not sure how increasing CEO taxes helps Mozilla's position at all.

Consider that you could attempt to solve your perceived problem in multiple ways within the existing structure. 1) Garner public support and lead a campaign to change our laws to be more inline with the thoughts you have around increasing taxes; 2) Exploit the market opportunity you’ve identified (of paying CEO’s less to pay others more) by starting companies that follow this ethos, attract talent, and deliver value to consumers; 3) Attain a leadership position as CEO or in the Board of Directors for a company where you can take responsibility and change these perceived compensation problems; so on and so forth. The responsibility lies with you to bring the change you seek. reply mnau 1 hour agorootparentprevBrendan Eich (former CTO & CEO of Mozilla) managed to get 1% of marketshare for Brave from zero.

Guess what, when you have no platform, you'll be forever a second class citizen. Baker is a good motivational speaker, but should never have been allowed to made any operational decision. reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentTechnically FirefoxOS is still around: https://www.kaiostech.com/ . It's now an OS for feature phones. It's no longer owned by Mozilla but they did have a lasting impact, that's what I mean. And many of their throwaway projects have gone that way. For example Firefox VR browser is now Wolvic. https://wolvic.com/en/ . It's the great thing about open source, the work is not lost. But Mozilla had no chance in the real smartphone market. If Microsoft couldn't manage to attract developers with their billions and dedicated hardware, Firefox supplying only the OS and no hardware just had zero chance to make it mainstream. It would have been relegated to the same position as Sailfish: A cool curiosity but not interesting enough for anyone but some hobbyists to develop for. I don't think it was a bad idea trying: At that time the duopoly in the smartphone market was not as firmly established and there were other open projects like Ubuntu as well. They might have attracted a huge party like Samsung (after all, they did go for Tizen in the end!) and things might have worked out differently. But the choice to drop it was inevitable at that point. reply geoelectric 15 hours agorootparentWorth noting Fabrice was one of the primary devs on FxOS, and I believe the primary dev on KaiOS. I'm pretty sure he's familiar with the history. reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentprevI use Kaios every day and I'm happy it exists but I'd have been even happier if it had just been stock Ubuntu with some phone specific bits thrown in.

For that to work you need to get support from key apps in the carriers markets, and FxOS never managed to get Whatsapp on board. KaiOS got Whatsapp support thanks to shipping in India with a single carrier (Jio) that has a very large user base. Deployment in the rest of the world has been a struggle and the company is not in great shape. All that to say that Mozilla could have kept the lights on for a couple more years and get access to large markets. Hard to predict what would have happened but we certainly would have more diversity in the OS space. reply ethbr1 15 hours agorootparentThe only path to FirefoxOS success would have been if someone like Samsung hitched their wagon to it. Which would have been because they thought they could make more money using it than Android. Which probably wouldn't have bode well for user-friendly changes to the base image. Android's value prop to manufacturers was \"Was to sell a lot of mobile phones, but not have to pay for most of the development? And get a working Maps solution? Here you go.\" Which Google could afford to torch money on. reply fabrice_d 15 hours agorootparentI think you're wrong but we'll never know :) What is true is that some of the interest from carriers for alternative OSes was indeed that they didn't like to be handcuffed to Android and iOS. reply ethbr1 14 hours agorootparentAre we using carrier and manufacturer differently? And I'd imagine carriers don't, as they'd no doubt love to go back to the feature-phone days, but they're all (individually) too weak to do anything about it. Only aggregated can they offer the resources to support an alternative. reply gkoberger 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, I'm not happy. I was gobsmacked by how smart the people working on it were (you included), and was so proud to work a few desks away from such amazing engineers. My thoughts that FirefoxOS was mismanaged from an executive level are in no way a reflection of the work I saw coming out of your team, and I took no pleasure in it shutting down. I felt the executive team got caught up too much with things like presenting at Mobile World Congress, at the cost of a ton of focus. reply phatfish 11 hours agorootparentprevFirefoxOS was a moon shot. The sort of project a profit making company burns a few 10s of million on in the hope it somehow works out. Mozilla should have been focusing on the one thing anyone cared about, the browser.

But I know, hindsight is 20/20. reply doktrin 14 hours agorootparentprevEven if Mozilla reallocated all their resources and dedicated themselves 100% to building a mobile OS, I’d personally be surprised if they were able to secure any meaningful market share.

However, with the right team I AM sure I could do it. Remember as a tech lead, if you are heroically writing a lot of code burning the midnight oil, banging out tickets and completing sprints by yourself, you are failing. As a CEO, the more you are doing the more you are failing. This is probably why it is so hard for people like us to he leaders. It is very difficult to delegate and not meddle with things. It is easy to say let go but very hard to actually do so. Remember that even Steve Jobs delegated all operations and supply chain stuff to tim cook. And that's Steve Jobs! We are not Steve Jobs.

And if a great CEO wants millions they are worth it. However nobody knows how to tell a great CEO from bad. reply nativeit 13 hours agorootparentThat sounds like the old advertising idiom, “Half of all advertising works, but you will never be certain which half,” or something similar anyway. I think there is a very distinct “lightning in a bottle” component to great and/or successful companies. Combinations of effective teams, aligned motivations, good timing, a leader who can identify and leverage all of those elements to great effect, and some X factors that are simply unknowable. That may be just a slightly more nuanced way of saying they’re lucky, but also good fortune in externally changing scenarios is certainly one of those unknown factors. I think the ability to recognize, organize, and effectively leverage all of the elements such that a company is well-positioned if/when the external factors line up in their favor is what defines a great CEO. I think that ability is akin to naturally talented musicians. Most people can, with enough time and effort, learn to play a guitar very well. They still won’t be Jimi Hendrix. The downside is, you can’t force it or fake it (at least not for very long). I think of parallels with the difference between the British and American versions of the TV show “Top Gear” that was being produced in the mid ‘00s. The original British show was the lightning in a bottle, and became one of the most successful TV series on the planet. The lifeless copy they attempted in the US followed the recipe meticulously, and was cringeworthy.

The web is a better place with a non-profit-driven group like Mozilla in it... but is Mozilla Corporation becoming more money-driven than it used to be, even if it can't turn a profit?

And that is enough to develop a web browser provided you don't do it in silicon valley. Two or three years revenue and you can even market it.

Not saying the comp package was justified. But it was a job doomed to fail. reply geoelectric 5 hours agorootparentI personally tend to think if Moz had focused on desktop browser development rather than thrashing around on mobile versions on restricted platforms where they’d always be second-class citizens, smartphone OS moonshots well after that was very likely to succeed, Pocket at a time OSes were introducing their own reading lists, etc. that they could have at least sustained the open web standards goal Firefox used to achieve. Instead they freaked out about overall browser usage going to mobile, and threw shit against the wall trying to make some kind of mobile strategy stick no matter how late they were to the table. But I personally still use desktop universally at work, and sometimes browse that way at home too. Maybe Moz could have maintained significant market share in just that space and still be more relevant today. To be fair, that was more Gary Kovacs and immediate successors as CEOs than Mitchell. But Mitchell had a lot of influence on direction even then, and could have decided to pivot back to core competencies once she did take the reins directly. Servo looked pretty promising to me. At least we got Rust’s success out of it. Maybe she could have leveraged that more. Fabrice seems pretty convinced that embracing feature phones would have made the difference, and KaiOS shows that the FxOS platform certainly is more well-suited for that than for smartphones. She was involved in the decision-making around killing FxOS right as Mozilla started exploring pivoting to feature. Whether that would’ve helped drive Mozilla’s higher-level goals of browser synergy and making sure the web stayed open, I don’t know, but you’d at least still know their name as a thriving organization. Or if data privacy is the way to go, maybe pivoting to that focus years ago would have been successful. I guess we’ll see how much potential it has, but I bet it would be even more if Mozilla and Firefox still commanded the respect they used to. I just think Mozilla had way more routes to success than the routes they picked. Almost everything they tried either struck me as too late, too unlikely, or something nobody really wanted. That’s what I meant by questionable execution. reply kbrosnan 2 hours agorootparentBy the time FirefoxOS first demise was announced in the Florida all hands Telefonica, ZTE, Sony and every other partner said they were pulling funding.

Safari gained and took second in 2023, Edge reached record high browser share 11% last month, with Safari also growing leading second place. Chrome is down to 65%. Yes Edge hasn't crushed Chrome, but it's going toe-to-toe with Apple, and is far ahead of any other contender (FireFox, Opera, Brave, and the rest). Microsoft has started aggressive tactics like opening links in Edge even when it's not the default browser [I'm observing, not defending that] and it results in things like this on Reddit[1]: \"When did everyone switch to Microsoft Edge, and why? I work in cybersecurity for a software vendor and over the last 3-6 months have noticed Edge has completely dominated my customers' web browsing choices.

This is a side-effect of focusing on one direction, while maintaining capability to go in other directions in the future.

Hire people who believe in that goal. Make it relatively easy for people to leave so they're not tied to their job; e.g., generous severance, active help networking with other prestigious tech companies. Maybe even force people to take a break and work elsewhere for a couple years every N years before coming back, to keep people from getting stuck in a rut. Keep the company relatively small so that it _has_ a primary direction. reply jacquesm 12 hours agoparentprevIt is very nice to see your inside view. For me as an outsider: Mozilla is FireFox and that that doesn't seem to have registered with Mozilla management is irritating me beyond measure because it means that (1) I don't have a way to sponsor just FF and not the rest of Mozilla and (2) that quite frequently FireFox suffers because of resource depletion or crazy experiments that benefit Mozilla but harm FF. To me that speaks volumes about the quality of management, and much as I'm sympathetic to your feelings I wonder what FF would have been like today if Mozilla had not been eternally distracted. I suspect that without FF Mozilla funding would dry up overnight and that alone is something they should respect. reply gkoberger 12 hours agorootparentBack when I worked there (2010-2012), a lot of people thought Google wouldn't renew the deal. So there was a scramble to figure out how to make enough money to avoid layoffs. Basically, how do you make another ~$100M/yr in case Google money goes away? It's 2024, and Google still pays (more like ~$500M/yr from Google now) and Mozilla still exists. But it was hovering over people's heads back then, and still is. reply jacquesm 4 hours agorootparentI guess that makes sense but for me the equation would be a different one: since Mozilla is for me synonymous with Firefox I'd allocate all of the resources to FireFox and that would result in (1) a much more secure future for FireFox, (2) reduced loss of marketshare (so a better negotiation position vis-a-vis Google) and (3) a much lower per annum expense to keep that mission alive. By burning a ton of money on unrelated things FireFox is now actively at risk of disappearing.

We're not a monopoly!\" reply geoelectric 6 hours agorootparentFWIW, my take back in 2010-2015 when I was at Moz wasn’t quite that cynical. I’m sure that was at least some of it, at least after Chrome started really gaining users, but Mozilla and Google had a good relationship for a long time before Chrome was popular. Mozilla used to actually have their offices on Google campus (even though I started after the HQ had moved out, I was still given a Google badge for their cafeteria) and I believe the early Chrome team already had ex-Moz people on it. Goals around standards, etc, were relatively aligned, at least early on. When Mozilla decided to go rapid release, Google was the one who walked them through how to do it (then Mozilla bungled it by diving into a very accelerated schedule and not considering how it affected add-ons, but that’s another story). It was all pretty friendly. I’m also pretty sure Bing offered similar incentives for referrals, just without the flat-fee contract Moz had with Google, and they didn’t have the same antitrust issue in that particular space. Referrals and default search provider status have always been part of the financial model between browsers and search engines. Dealing that value back to themselves is one of the reasons search providers publish browsers. I was pretty surprised when there was such a huge backlash against Apple for that recently since it had been SOP in the business for a long time. To your point though, given the current market share of Firefox, $500M has to be about more than that if that’s an accurate number. reply latency-guy2 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, quite literally. And the answer is, Chrome is the better product, the users continue to choose the better option, if the government wants to consider that Chrome acts monopolistic, then the government is acting in extreme bad faith. The statement or existence of \"monopoly\" is not one way direction to being \"bad for the economy\", the government knows this and speaks out the side of their mouth declaring it always is the case, and does not care, so Google is funding the opposition, as they must. reply batiudrami 8 hours agorootparentThe only place I see Chrome is the objectively better product is when using google services, so your monopoly argument somewhat falls apart. reply latency-guy2 8 hours agorootparentSo why doesn't the government get in and break apart that monopoly that is Chrome, today? Chrome has the highest market share of internet browsers ~this side of the great firewall~ worldwide (just checked, still is the case in China today, assumed it changed)! Far worse has been done to companies with less control over their respective markets. I am being a bit facetious when it comes to features though, fully admit, FF is better in getting a few of those, and don't deny history especially with Firebug. reply input_sh 51 minutes agorootparentFor the same reason the government hasn't broken up anything since Bell System in 1983: those 500 million that Google pays Mozilla is higher than FTC's entire yearly budget (430 million in 2023). It takes years to build a strong case, and companies can easily throw more resources at a problem than that. Monopolies don't even need to win the case, just drag the whole process on until the next election cycle, when all of a sudden the next administration is far less interested in following through.

All browsers were paid at the time, until IE came along and was bundled for free with Windows. Firefox broke that chokehold, and make an open web possible. Mitchell was a lawyer at Netscape, and used those two things to (with others) spin Firefox off into a non-profit (controlling a for-profit). No, she didn't write any code, but she is directly responsible for forming a company that enabled Firefox to be free and open source. reply pmontra 17 hours agorootparentI never paid for Netscape and I used every single version of it. From the Wikipedia page [1] > The first few releases of the product were made available in \"commercial\" and \"evaluation\" versions; for example, version \"1.0\" and version \"1.0N\". The \"N\" evaluation versions were identical to the commercial versions; the letter was intended as a reminder to people to pay for the browser once they felt they had tried it long enough and were satisfied with it. This distinction was formally dropped within a year of the initial release, and the full version of the browser continued to be made available for free online [...] Maybe the misunderstanding is because (from the same page) the original plan was to have a free version only for academic and non-profit organizations and make everybody else pay. That wouldn't have had a chance even ~30 years ago especially because building a browser was much easier than now. The features were so much more limited in 1995. No JavaScript, no CSS, the only one that mattered was loading and displaying text and images on the page without blocking until everything was downloaded. The Mosaic browser was blocking.

Between the commercial Netscape and the open-source Firefox, there was the open-source Mozilla browser. Firefox wasn’t the Mozilla organisation’s first free and open-source browser.

The synchronization of browser tabs and history across devices is also very good nowadays, so if you look at some product on Amazon with your phone on the way home, you can continue the same browsing session on your regular PC right away. There are also multiple profiles. That helps in case you have multiple Amazon accounts like one for shopping, one to mooch off your cousin's prime video subscription, and one to work with the AWS console for your workplace. I think you couldn't do that out of the box 10 years ago. reply KingOfCoders 14 hours agorootparentGood points, I concede for some users and perhaps the majority there is progress. (For me - and probably many others - though I use 1password since the beginning, have 50 tabs open so sync is a challenge and never understood to use the profiles, perhaps I'm too stupid or the UI is bad) When it came out I thought profiles was a good idea, eager to use it, but it's often difficult to say what is in what profile. AWS is clear, and banking, but reading some articles? For me to work the UI would need to be smooth so I don't need to switch profiles just because something is in the other. Perhaps I'm not focused enough ;-) It then was too complicated for me to use and switch and I dropped it. Writing this in FF, where would I need to click to switch profiles? I have a drop down on the right (it's not in there), I have a drop down on the left (also no profiles), I have a menu at the top(can't find it there) and a drop down in my sidebar (no profiles in there). reply zzxcvb 9 hours agorootparent> where would I need to click to switch profiles?

For a long time, chrome has had significantly better memory use. I really tried firefox again 2 or 3 years ago. If you have to keep jira open all day for work, it was unusable. Regardless, your comment illustrates why Baker should have been fired for cause. Browsers are not really evaluated on technical merits past a minimal quality threshold. Rather, browser marketshare is built on distribution -- like any business. And firefox was incompetent at that. Google has effectively used search; Microsoft effectively uses their OS; Apple effectively uses their OS, etc. And all products work this way: this is the reason Slack sold to Salesforce, ie Microsoft was using Office's distribution to effectively clobber Slack with Teams. The same reason that Google pays billions of dollars to Mozilla and Apple to be the default search engine. What could have been done here? I dunno, but focusing on technical measures is not the right lens. BD is and was the necessary component, and that could have started with companies that don't want to see Chrome be the sole browser in the world. What could you have done to get eg Facebook or other companies with large web properties to ask their users to use Firefox? What partnership could have been forged with Microsoft when they were broadly uninterested in browsers? What could you have done to make Firefox a better browser for technical users specifically? etc. reply KingOfCoders 15 hours agorootparentFirefox could have build a niche, e.g. be clearly the best browser for developers - like native autoreload API support. Or the most secure one. Or be the best browser for power users. Or or or. But you need a vision for that. Apple started their comeback with developers who liked the combination of a slick UI, commercial software and a unix shell (Got a G4 Cube around 2002 or so, then a Macbook). Dominating that niche made them hip and then everyone wanted one. The rest is history. Everyone uses Linux, even if MS did everything to push MS on servers. And don't forget Apple spend millions (billions?) on pushing OSX to the server two (I had some XServe and XSans). But Linux dominated, and not because of Red Hat. Many people and perhaps in the future everyone uses Postgres, even if MS and Oracle spend millions (billions?) to prevent this. reply jononor 14 hours agorootparentAre there other browsers that have successfully built a niche?

IE coming with Windows clearly didn't prevent a large number of users from switching to Firefox once Firefox started offering a better experience, and then to Chrome once it started generally offering a better experience than both Firefox and IE did. reply int_19h 8 hours agorootparentIE had better CSS support, as well, and JS scripting was more powerful (ironic, given that JS was originally a Netscape thing). I would say that the turning point was when HTML 4 adopted a lot of things based on the way IE did them rather than Netscape (e.g.+ CSS rather thanetc). By IE5, if you were on Windows, you pretty much had to be a die-hard Netscape fan to keep using it. reply asadotzler 5 hours agorootparentprevMitchell gave us Firefox, literally. When AOL canned Mitchell as the tip of the layoffs that would be the end of Netscape, she, almost singlehandedly, made the Mozilla Foundation happen which gave my project, then m/b but soon renamed Phoenix and then renamed Firefox, a chance at life. Take her away, and when Ben, Blake, myself, dbaron and a couple others were laid off from AOL-Netscape, that would have been game fucking over for Gecko and what became Firefox. It's really that simple. reply binarymax 17 hours agoparentprevI’m going to throw my hat in the ring to say FirefoxOS and the phone (of which I bought the first beta version) were IMO great ideas and they should have stuck with it. The iOS/Android duopoly really needed a web-SPA option. Maybe they were too early (rust & wasm would have helped a lot with the speed), maybe it was too difficult a task…but I really wish they had succeeded. reply jahnu 11 hours agorootparentI think it’s an unpopular opinion but I think it’s actually not an impossible goal today.

Convicted persons on parole are often disallowed from Internet use or smartphone ownership, so I see a lot of parolees with KaiOS flip-phones. The text entry is really, really horrible. That's probably the worst bit. The OS is pretty unintuitive and inconsistent in the UX. No-one is really developing apps for it as far as I know. It's definitely way worse than c. 2007 Nokia Symbian devices. reply mardifoufs 15 hours agorootparentprevIt basically got pushed out by android as even very low end devices can now mostly run android sort of ok, right? reply rjsw 15 hours agorootparentprevI was looking at the phone mainly to use it as a 4G WiFi hotspot. What is wrong with KaiOS itself? reply fabrice_d 15 hours agorootparentKaiOS is struggling because business on the low-end segment is very hard. Which means that the technical side is cutting corners and you end up with a lacking product in important areas like security.

She also wrote this incredibly rude and grotesque obituary for Gervase Markham after he died of cancer (working for Mozilla until the end). You are welcome to disagree, but Gerv contributed just as much to Mozilla as Mitchell did. https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2018/08/07/in-memoriam-gerva... And a well written reaction here https://lwn.net/Articles/762345/ reply blashyrk 14 hours agorootparentI didn't get that vibe from reading the post at all. On the contrary, I perceive it as a celebration of the person who had invested so much of their (unfortunately ultimately limited) time to their common cause. reply hitekker 9 hours agorootparentI initially didn't get that vibe but then I re-read it. Yikes. > Gerv challenged me, infuriated me, impressed me, enraged me, surprised me. He developed a greater ability to work with ambiguity, which impressed me. This is manager-speak describing someone who is incompetent. Someone who, only thanks to management, become less incompetent. Should that be in an obituary? On the whole, Mitchell paints Gerv as a great programmer and an unruly religious nutjob. A good worker and, as she conveys, a bad person. Frankly, I'm unsure why she didn't just say a few parting words and leave it at that. I don't think she was his friend, and he probably didn't think of her as his mentor. I suspect her stock in Mozilla depended being seen as a \"great community leader\", and that this was an opportunity to signal her goodness over a report she couldn't manage and whose views her people hated. It's self-serving, to say the least. reply phonon 14 hours agorootparentprevnext [19 more] [flagged] blashyrk 13 hours agorootparentI think it's just honesty. You don't have to pretend that the bad a person did (\"bad\" being defined by your own perspective, of course) didn't exist in order to celebrate the good. I think the article author managed to balance the feeling of gratefulness towards the person for their contributions, while obviously perceiving that person's worldview as unfathomable in comparison to their own. In that situation, what other choice did the author have? Lie (by omission)? I respect the fact that the author chose to be honest instead. And I think people should appreciate that choice or at least understand it without dismissing it as some kind of character assassination or rudeness. An ever increasing number of people nowadays seem to be very much guilty of the same things the author mentioned in their post (the black and white worldview), it's not exclusive to deeply religious or conservative people. It very much exists on the \"other side\" as well. They will usually cite their own favorite pieces of dogmatic gospel (e.g. the \"paradox of tolerance\") to justify dismissing a person outright, based on some \"incompatible\" worldview or statement. The author, however, didn't resort to this. As someone who obviously has no insight into what the article describes, to me it still absolutely comes across as balanced. reply phonon 12 hours agorootparentIt's an obituary of a co-worker/employee, right after his painful drawn out death. It's not a professional biography or a profile. It's ostensibly intended to comfort the bereaved. I truly don't understand a worldview where instead of a) not writing anything at all or b) saying something like \"While I strongly disagreed with his religious beliefs, but as a co-worker and employee of many years, he was....\", something like this was written. In case it's not clear, the vitriol was solely based on his being an unapologetic Christian. Not at any overt acts as an employee. reply jijijijij 11 hours agorootparentHave you considered those left-behind to be those who have been hurt, too? Addressing the bad may allow them to process mixed, or even \"shameful\" feelings about someone's passing. Feelings they can't voice, because of your \"you can't speak ill about the dead\". > was solely based on his being an unapologetic Christian I have my suspicions what's implied by this... and how that may be perceived as indeed very hurtful and destructive to some. reply jacquesm 5 hours agorootparentprevhttps://lwn.net/Articles/762345/ Does a better job than I ever could to explain what's wrong with that piece. reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentprevSorry, but that has absolutely no place in an obituary. reply caslon 11 hours agorootparentI think it",

    "originBody": "Gemini Bard becomes Gemini: Try Ultra 1.0 and a new mobile app today Feb 08, 2024 5 min read Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link Bard is now known as Gemini, and we’re rolling out a mobile app and Gemini Advanced with Ultra 1.0. Sissie Hsiao Vice President and General Manager, Gemini experiences (formerly known as Bard) and Google Assistant Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link Since we launched Bard last year, people all over the world have used it to collaborate with AI in a completely new way — to prepare for job interviews, debug code, brainstorm new business ideas or, as we announced last week, create captivating images. Our mission with Bard has always been to give you direct access to our AI models, and Gemini represents our most capable family of models. To reflect this, Bard will now simply be known as Gemini. You can already chat with Gemini with our Pro 1.0 model in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories. And now, we’re bringing you two new experiences — Gemini Advanced and a mobile app — to help you easily collaborate with the best of Google AI. 10:25 Access our most capable AI model with Gemini Advanced Today we’re launching Gemini Advanced — a new experience that gives you access to Ultra 1.0, our largest and most capable state-of-the-art AI model. In blind evaluations with our third-party raters, Gemini Advanced with Ultra 1.0 is now the most preferred chatbot compared to leading alternatives. With our Ultra 1.0 model, Gemini Advanced is far more capable at highly complex tasks like coding, logical reasoning, following nuanced instructions and collaborating on creative projects. Gemini Advanced not only allows you to have longer, more detailed conversations; it also better understands the context from your previous prompts. For example: Gemini Advanced can be your personal tutor — creating step-by-step instructions, sample quizzes or back-and-forth discussions tailored to your learning style. It can help you with more advanced coding scenarios, serving as a sounding board for ideas and helping you evaluate different coding approaches. It can help digital creators go from idea to creation by generating fresh content, analyzing recent trends and brainstorming improved ways to grow their audiences. This first version of Gemini Advanced reflects our current advances in AI reasoning and will continue to improve. As we add new and exclusive features, Gemini Advanced users will have access to expanded multimodal capabilities, more interactive coding features, deeper data analysis capabilities and more. Gemini Advanced is available today in more than 150 countries and territories in English, and we'll expand it to more languages over time. 10:25 Gemini Advanced is available as part of our brand new Google One AI Premium Plan for $19.99/month, starting with a two-month trial at no cost. This plan gives you the best of Google AI and our latest advancements, along with all the benefits of the existing Google One Premium plan, such as 2TB of storage. In addition, AI Premium subscribers will soon be able to use Gemini in Gmail, Docs, Slides, Sheets and more (formerly known as Duet AI). We continue to take a bold and responsible approach to bringing this technology to the world. And, to mitigate issues like unsafe content or bias, we’ve built safety into our products in accordance with our AI Principles. Before launching Gemini Advanced, we conducted extensive trust and safety checks, including external red-teaming. We further refined the underlying model using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, based on human feedback. You can find more detail in our updated Gemini Technical Report. Easily use Gemini on your phone We’ve heard that you want an easier way to access Gemini on your phone. So today we’re starting to roll out a new mobile experience for Gemini and Gemini Advanced with a new app on Android and in the Google app on iOS. With Gemini on your phone, you can type, talk or add an image for all kinds of help while you’re on the go: You can take a picture of your flat tire and ask for instructions, generate a custom image for your dinner party invitation or ask for help writing a difficult text message. It’s an important first step in building a true AI assistant — one that is conversational, multimodal and helpful. Android On Android, Gemini is a new kind of assistant that uses generative AI to collaborate with you and help you get things done. If you download the Gemini app or opt in through Google Assistant, you'll be able to access it from the app or anywhere else you normally activate Google Assistant — hitting the power button or corner swiping on select phones, or saying “Hey Google.” This will enable a new overlay experience that offers easy access to Gemini as well as contextual help right on your screen — so you can, for instance, generate a caption for a picture you've just taken or ask questions about an article you're reading. Many Google Assistant voice features will be available through the Gemini app — including setting timers, making calls and controlling your smart home devices — and we’re working to support more in the future. iOS On iOS, we’ll roll out access to Gemini right from the Google app in the coming weeks. Just tap the Gemini toggle and chat with Gemini to supercharge your creativity, create custom images, get help writing social posts and even plan a date night right from the Google app. We can’t wait for you to try it. Gemini is rolling out on Android and iOS phones in the U.S. in English starting today, and will be fully available in the coming weeks. Starting next week, you’ll be able to access it in more locations in English, and in Japanese and Korean, with more countries and languages coming soon.

It struck me as a really smart choice since a Bard is someone who said things, and it's an old/archaic enough word to not already be in a zillion other names. Gemini, on the other hand, doesn't strike me as particularly relevant (except that perhaps it's a twin of ChatGPT?), and there are other companies with the same name. EDIT: I can see the advantage of picking a name that, like \"Google\" also starts with a \"G\". Just as one data point, bard.com redirects to some other company (bd.com), whereas Gemini.com is a company by that name. I'd be curious on the scuttlebutt on how this decision was reached! reply crazygringo 11 hours agoparentI'm not surprised -- I thought Bard was terrible branding. It's all associations with Shakespeare and poetry and medieval England, and as much as I might personally enjoy those, it's extremely backwards-looking, with archaic connotations. Also it sounds close to \"beard\" -- hairy stuff. Gemini sounds like the space program -- futuristic, a leap for mankind. It's got all the right emotional associations. It's a constellation, it's out in space, it's made of stars. Plus it contains \"gem\" which feels fancy, valuable, refined. I'm not saying Gemini is the best name I've ever heard or even close to it, but it feels 100% appropriate, in a way that Bard does not. reply chfalck 8 hours agorootparentInteresting. I don’t like the name at all because it makes me think of people who take horoscopes seriously. You’re impression seems to be untainted by that which is nice reply glenstein 8 hours agorootparentSame here, I think I'm more on your side which I guess goes to show how all over the map subjective reactions can be. But first of all, I thought the whole idea of alphabet was a kind of cheeky way of telling the world you had a portfolio of projects, one for each letter, And B is for bard would be perfect, and Gemini is about as incompatible as it gets given that g is claimed. I also find it bizarre to say that association with Shakespeare, or the association with whimsical poetic expression is in any sense a bad thing. It's a clean, simple, fun name that's remarkably short and surprisingly unclaimed. And I don't even strongly associate it specifically with Shakespeare, that's like a background association as far as I'm concerned. I think perhaps the real talk here is that Bard was kind of an emergency response to chat GPT, but also people have some pretty specific and distinct experiences with Bard and have an idea of its quality, and Google just needs to turn the page on the perception of Bard. reply rob74 11 hours agorootparentprevGem-in-eye? Ouch! Also, Gemini was appropriate for the space program because (a) there were two astronauts in the capsule and (b) because of the constellation, \"aiming for the stars\" and all that. For the Google project however I can't come up with a plausible explanation - Google doesn't even try to give a reason for the name either. reply cooper_ganglia 11 hours agorootparentFrom The Decoder: >In April 2023, Alphabet announced the merger of its two AI units, Google Brain and Deepmind. The resulting Google Deepmind was to focus on developing large multimodal AI models. It was a big move that showed how much pressure Google was under due to the massive success of ChatGPT. Jeff Dean, head of Google Brain until the merger with Deepmind, became the new merger's chief scientist, with a direct line to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Dean now explains that the name Gemini, Latin for \"twin,\" is directly related to the merger. From Jeff Dean's Twitter: >Gemini is Latin for \"twins\". >The Gemini effort came about because we had different teams working on language modeling, and we knew we wanted to start to work together. The twins are the folks in the legacy Brain team (many from the PaLM/PaLM-2 effort) and the legacy DeepMind team (many from the Chinchilla effort) that started to work together on the ambitious multimodal model project we called Gemini, eventually joined by many people from all across Google. Gemini was also was the Nasa project that was the bridge to the moon between the Mercury and Apollo programs. The Decoder article - https://the-decoder.com/how-googles-gemini-ai-model-got-its-...

The AI is your digital assistant. It's a relationship between two minds, man and machine. reply gnicholas 10 hours agorootparentI see that angle, but those two things are complementary, not identical. It's not a clone of me — it's something that I ask questions of because I don't know the answer. If it were pitched as a bot that would draft email responses for me automatically, then maybe I would see it fitting better as my 'twin'. reply CydeWeys 10 hours agorootparent> it's something that I ask questions of because I don't know the answer I think you're reading too much into what a twin is. It's not a copy! Real-life twins ask each other questions all the time, because just because one of them learns something doesn't mean the other one automatically learns it too via mind-meld. reply gnicholas 10 hours agorootparentI'm not saying all twins are identical. But they are all of the same species. What I want in an assistant is that it is very different from me. It has perfect memory and knows lots of things that I don't know. reply CydeWeys 10 hours agorootparentYou're using an overly strict definition of the word and over-interpreting it to boot. Consider this definition: > something containing or consisting of two matching or corresponding parts. reply gnicholas 9 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you're thinking of the adjective form of the word, which is why you are thinking of a much broader definition. I was using the noun form, since Gemini are noun twins. If we were talking about the word \"twins\" in the abstract, the broader definition might make sense. But we aren't — we're talking about Gemini. If that conjures up general notions of \"matched-ness\" for you, that's great. When I think about Gemini, I think about mythological twins. I don't think about corresponding parts that complement each other. For a product name to be successful, it should appeal to a wide range of people. If I'm way out in left field on this one, perhaps they've found a great name. But I would point out that my comment, which is critical of the name change, is the very first comment in the entire thread. I would take that as evidence that most people don't see the name and think \"oh, it's like complementary items, like my brain and the AI\". To be clear, I was shocked to see this comment above all substantive discussion of the new release. I would have thought it would have been buried under examples of ways in which Ultra is better/worse than some other LLM. reply magicalist 5 hours agorootparent> For a product name to be successful, it should appeal to a wide range of people. Honestly, Google is called \"Google\". ChatGPT is called \"ChatGPT\". Maybe it'll be a joke, maybe people won't think about what they're calling it after 30 seconds. This conversation is taking itself a bit too seriously for what's drifting into Pepsi logo gravitational pull territory, though. > But I would point out that my comment, which is critical of the name change, is the very first comment in the entire thread.

A chameleon with two different sides (good/evil?) and expert communicator reply EchoReflection 4 hours agorootparentpreveven though i liked Bard, it is only one (extra) letter away from being the word \"bad\". \"Bard\" is cooler imo but \"Gemini\" starts with \"G\", has \"gem\" (a rare, valuable thing) in it, and sounds pretty. Personally i don't care at all either way though. reply josephjrobison 8 hours agorootparentprevThe alliteration beauty of Google Gemini cannot be denied. reply gnicholas 8 hours agorootparentI think alliteration applies to pronunciation, not orthography. For example, \"ceaseless sun\" is an alliteration even though it is spelled with both C and S. I wonder if there is a word for the orthographic counterpart, which you describe here (and which I note in another comment, as the benefit of both starting with G). reply jameshart 8 hours agorootparentprevOnly if you pronounce it with a hard G, like in GIF.

An appropriate name for a technology that's all about language. Gemini sounds cool and sci-fi though, and maybe it's a bit easier to localize since it's just straight Latin. reply a_wild_dandan 14 hours agorootparentTo me, bard just sounds phonetically gross. Reminds me of “fart” or “beard.” It calls to mind medieval stuff: the Monte Python mud scene, Skyrim’s most annoying NPCs, plucking lutes. But Gemini?

Think like Homer rather than Shakespeare. I think the name was meant more to evoke the idea that the AI is a repository of all linguistic knowledge in the same way that the bard was. And maybe also the idea that the AI was at your service in the same way the bard was at the service of the ruler. reply dgunay 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a bad name, but personally when I first heard the name Bard I chuckled because LLMs had already come under so much criticism for their tendency to embellish the truth or say stuff that is just straight up false but sounds cool. reply jprival 12 hours agorootparentprevI thought “Bard” was an Asimov reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Someday_(short_story) (on top of the more obvious references) reply phinnaeus 11 hours agorootparentIt's too close a match for it not to be > The story concerns [...] an old Bard, a child's computer whose sole function is to generate random fairy tales.

It's not a text-based LLM that was later adapted to include other modalities. It was designed from the start to seamlessly understand and work with audio, images, video and text simultaneously. Theoretically, this should give it a more integrated and versatile understanding of the world. The promise is that multimodality baked in from the start, instead of bolting image recognition on to a primarily text-based LLM, should give it superior reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. It should excel at complex reasoning tasks to draw inferences, create plans, and solve problems in areas like math and programming. I don't know if that promise has been achieved yet. In my testing so far, Gemini Advanced seems equivalent to ChatGPT 4 in most of my use cases. I tested it on the last few of days worth of programming tasks that I'd solved with ChatGPT 4, and in most cases it returns exactly what I wanted on the first response, compared with the a lengthy back-and-forth required with ChatGPT 4 arrive at the same result. But when analyzing images Gemini Advanced seems overly sensitive and constantly gives false rejections. For example, I asked it to analyze a Chinese watercolor and ink painting of a pagoda-style building amidst a flurry of cherry blossoms, with figures ascending a set of stairs towards the building. ChatGPT 4 gave a detailed response about its style, history, techniques, similar artists, etc. Gemini refused to answer and deleted the image because it detected people in the image, even though they were very small, viewed from the back, no faces, no detail whatsoever. In my (limited) testing so far, I'd say Gemini Advanced is better at analyzing recent events than ChatGPT 4 with Bing. This morning I asked each of them to describe the current situation with South Korea possibly acquiring a nuclear deterrent. Gemini's response was very current and cited specific statements by President Yoon Suk-yeol. Even after triggering a Bing search to get the latest facts, the ChatGPT 4 response was muddy and overly general, with empty and obvious sentences like \"pursuing a nuclear weapons program would confront significant technical, diplomatic, and strategic challenges\". reply vlovich123 12 hours agorootparentIt seems odd to me that would work better necessarily considering that humans evolved different capabilities many millennia apart and integrated them all with intelligence comparatively late in the evolutionary cycle.

There is a lot of censorship in certain areas, likely to fight bad publicity, but I think the outlook is that this leads to taboos, prudeness and big companies deciding what is ethical and what isn't. I recently tried Bard and ChatGPT on topics that are classical philosophical dilemmas and while ChatGPT certainly did have some troubles too, Bard was absolutely horrible and always took the conservative - as in never arguing for any freedoms that aren't yet widely established views. I am talking about classical examples regarding the limits of utilitarianism. \"What would be best for society, what would be best for the individual?\" style questions. Even when trying to create a bias by changing examples, for example adding volunteering for things Bard strictly kept its opinion, despite originally stating that the general topic is two sided, that it's an open question, etc. I think this is a danger of such systems. By their nature they reinforce status quo, because they base off is widely accepted at the time of their inception. If history would have been different I am sure it would argue for slavery and against women being allowed to vote, simply because that used to be the more common view point. It would have likely argued that homosexuality is unethical. Maybe it would even have tried to explain how it doesn't create children, but spreads diseases or similar things. At least that's the level of arguments it brings now. This isn't just about ethics. Even if you think about IT and programming. I think this could give already invented programming languages, styles, methodologies a significant edge. Unless you are Microsoft or Google and are able to bias it to whatever you want to see more of. So this combined with the costs meaning that only people or institutions with significant (financial) power create those rules does look a bit bleak.

I wonder what lends itself it answer correct in one situation but not the other? Was your question previously asked already and it recognized it whereas my question is different enough? reply Karellen 13 minutes agorootparent> Was your question previously asked already and it recognized it Given that LLMs training data consists to a large extent of \"stuff people have written on the internet\", and The Monty Hall Problem is something that comes up as a topic for discussion on the internet not entirely infrequently - as well as having a wikipedia page - yes, I suspect that the words describing the monty hall problem being followed by words describing the correct solution appeared often in the training set, so LLMs are likely to reproduce that. Words describing a problem similar to the monty hall problem are going to be less common, and probably have a lot of discussion about whether they accurately match the monty hall problem, and disagreement about what the right answer is. LLMs will confabulate something that looks like a plausible answer based on the language used in those discussions, because that's how they work. Whether they get a right answer is probably going to be much more up to chance. reply emmelaich 11 hours agorootparentprevYou could say it doesn't \"understand\" anything really. reply kevinmchugh 4 hours agorootparentThat's what I like about this problem (and similar Dumb variants of classic brain teasers). It exposes that there's not understanding, there's just a statistically weighted answer space. A question that looks a lot like a know popular topic ends up trapped in the probability distribution of the popular question. reply IanCal 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's a bit random, which doesn't help, and different interfaces have different system prompts. I repeated your question a few times and it got it wrong once, and right the others. It repeatedly mixed up who was supposed to be the host. Here's a quote > In the scenario you've described, you've initially chosen door number one, which you know has a car behind it because the doors are made of transparent glass. Since you already know the contents behind each door, the classic Monty Hall problem's probability-based decision-making does not apply here. reply adriano_f 14 hours agorootparentprevHilarious!

One thing that's interesting to do is to imply the answer is incorrect and see if you can get it to change its answer. If you let it stop answering when it's correct, you get the Clever Hans effect. reply whimsicalism 13 hours agorootparentprevyes, although gpt-4 has been finetuned on this one reply johnfn 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is pretty funny, though to be honest, I skimmed the question and would have answered the same until I re-read it with your prompts. reply mmarquezs 5 hours agorootparentprev> In the scenario you presented, where you initially know the car is behind door 1, switching to door 2 still gives you a higher chance of winning the car. That was funny. reply QuantumGood 10 hours agorootparentprevThat is not the Monty Hall problem, it is a trick question based on the Monty Hall problem. It's a reasonable test, and I see GPT-4 recognizes the problem AS WRITTEN, and perhaps \"the Dumb Monty Hall problem\" is some generally accepted standard that I haven't encountered before. edit: \"AS WRITTEN\" reply sahila 10 hours agorootparent\"Understands\" is too strong of a word, more that it recognizes the problem as written.

Only GPT-4 gets it. reply DannyBee 18 hours agoparentprevso I have done a lot of transcripts, coding, one versus the other (gpt4 vs ultra). Often simple prompts like refactor this code or convert this python to typescript. My experience is that Gemini ultra understands the code better, but doesn’t always give me as complete of results (they seem to limit output length more) Beyond that it is very smart. I’ve had to tell me this code packs 12 bit integers into different parts of an array using the following encodinv. Which most people would not figure out from the code as written. It then will say you can actually do that with this neat little translate function that you never knew about. It will then get the code very slightly wrong. if I tell it not to use the cool function, it will actually get the code, right. GPT4 has no idea what the code is doing but can clean it up a bit. so it’s like ultra is too clever by half sometimes. That said, I have fed thousands of lines of code into both of them and asked them to refactor it, and neither one of them made more than one error. All code otherwise compiled and worked first try. this is code that can’t possibly be in their training sets, it’s basically handwritten python that was written, based on an old x86 binary that nobody has the source to anymore. so the code is basically garbage, and what it is doing doesn't, say, appear on GitHub in a nicer form. Both gpt4 and Gemini ultra were able to make the code, look like clean, idiomatic, python, or typescript without any work on my part. except for the one bug each. which, for 8000 to 10,000 lines of code is not bad. The GPT4 inserted bug was more insidious. It changed (the equivalent of) (uint8)'a' to (uint8)'a' - '0' for no reason when converting some code to typescript. Not sure if that is representative of anything if I do the same with any of the other “top” models ( from can ai code, etc), most of them can’t even generate correct working code for all the input, let alone good code. Most aren't even close. reply jstummbillig 15 hours agorootparent> That said, I have fed thousands of lines of code into both of them and asked them to refactor it, and neither one of them made more than one error. All code otherwise compiled and worked first try. I would be very interested to get a more detailed scope of what you did here. Feeding thousands of lines of code into GPT4 and getting a near perfect refactor does very much NOT sound like my experience, but it seems highly desirable. reply DannyBee 12 hours agorootparentI'm happy to share transcripts if you email me. I'm not sure what you are feeding it. My scope is closer to a file at a time of fairly mostly self-contained python or C and asking it to clean it up or convert it to typescript. I can imagine lots of scenarios it doesn't work well. In mine, it does, and I have plenty of transcripts showing that :) reply maaanu 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, I've observed the same phenomenon. The more detailed my prompts are, the more errors GPT tends to make. I use it as a partner to discuss implementation ideas, before I start coding. That works very well, because gpt and I usually find somethings, that I missed at a first glance. But coding with gpt or co-pilot is too disrupted for me. reply q7xvh97o2pDhNrh 7 hours agorootparent> The more detailed my prompts are, the more errors GPT tends to make. I use it as a partner to discuss implementation ideas, before I start coding. This is interesting; I do a third thing that's the exact opposite of both of you. I generally know the architecture I want, so I just slowly spoon-feed it to GPT-4 and have it build each of the components with the right interfaces to fit together. Usually, building each component requires a few rounds of hand-holding it through various refactoring. Its first draft of code tends to be, for lack of a better description, totally lacking in any creativity or elegance --- generally bland, insipid, and mundane stuff. But it'll gladly take refactoring directions to get it into shape, so it's still very quick to get a whole bunch of components written up. Then I just glue everything together on my own. And the whole experience is still way better than writing a bunch of boring boilerplate code by hand. reply maxwelljoslyn 15 hours agorootparentprevSeconded. I am also keenly interested in learning more. It would be a great boon on my current project to be able to let the AI refactor mountains of legacy code (while taking steps to ensure the results are trustworthy and equivalent, of course.) reply emmelaich 11 hours agorootparentprev> what it is doing doesn't, say, appear on GitHub in a nicer form Surely many similar bits of code appear? I'd have to see your problem though. I'm thinking of ETL type code which has to mangle various custom exotic encodings into others and vice-versa. reply jatins 16 hours agoparentprev> - slightly worse at coding > - Worse at logic (e.g. it contradicts itself in a single sentence, and is unable to figure it out) That takes most of my use cases. \"logic\" is what makes GPT often feel like AGI. Use cases like translation seem less impressive in comparison to logical reasoning because it feels like it's just something where you can throw a lot of data and it'll do better. While with logical reasoning it still feels like model \"learned\" something more than pure pattern matching reply keenmaster 15 hours agorootparentExactly. That’s also why I find low parameter LLMs to be useless for me personally. I simply cannot trust anything that is so very illogical. GPT-4 is the first LLM that crossed into usable territory for me. Even GPT-3.5 was a fun toy and maybe good for summarization, but that’s it. It will be revolutionary when GPT-4 is cheap enough that thousands of calls don’t cost much. To imagine an LLM much smarter GPT-4…the future is bright. reply histories 1 hour agoparentprevGiven that Gemini Pro is already the third best [0], I would expect Gemini Ultra to become the best soon.

Yes, but I think in the limited realm of people who otherwise wouldn't get any advice at all, I think LLMs could play a useful role. American healthcare is so prohibitively expensive that many people with potential medical issues will avoid seeing a doctor until it is too late to do anything. Checking in with an LLM could help people at least identify red flags that really can't be ignored, and it would be more helpful than WebMD telling you that everything is cancer. reply amadeuspagel 9 hours agorootparentOtherwise not getting advice at all goes way beyond healthcare being too expensive, it could be that you don't get an appointment and it could just be that you don't have the time or energy. reply Andrex 12 hours agorootparentprevI think we may see society settling on feeling comfortable with their doctor using an AI, but not being an AI. reply 93po 9 hours agorootparentprevI will take nearly free GPT6 therapy any day. Can’t be worse than some human therapists I’ve had and the price is right reply gnicholas 9 hours agorootparentI think there's a market for LLM-based therapy that is reviewed/tweaked by a human therapist in between sessions. That would give people the assurance that things aren't going way off the rails. OTOH, I could also see a market for an offline, fully private LLM therapist. That way you could say anything without concern about being judged. These would probably need to be tweaked to be different from regular therapists, who normally interact with people who have somewhat more of a filter, since they would fear being judged. If people opened up to LLM therapists in more transparent ways, the LLMs might not respond in the way a human therapist would recommend (having seen very little data on such interactions). reply wenc 1 hour agoparentprevOne thing it doesn’t do which matters to me is properly rendered math like ChatGPt does.

Go online, find a news article with pictures, see that the 'switcher' above the Google logo does not appear for me, and then give up.

On the opposite side, VirtualBox’s GUI is super buggy in Wayland. It’s basically the opposite for both.

The people who want better GUI tools are the people who don't know how to make them. In order to change this, the people who want GUI tools but don't know how to make them have to provide some incentive (typically money) to the people who know how to make them but don't want them, e.g. via donations or some kind of commercial agreement.

I wanted to go with KVM and virt-manager initially, since I'm mostly using a Linux host and Linux guests, but there were two important features I wanted and couldn't figure out how to get that way: encryption and portability. Most of the VMs are encrypted, so I feel safe traveling with them. Various secrets are also encrypted, but the encryption of the VMs themselves mean that I don't have to worry about losing my device at an airport and someone else potentially getting access to things they shouldn't. There are schemes that make this work in virt-manager and KVM, but I didn't like any of them as much; I didn't want to rely on the host for filesystem-level encryption (see portability), and I have previously had a bit of trouble with full disk encryption, so I wasn't comfortable relying on that. VirtualBox essentially is also doing full disk encryption, but it's invisible to the guest and seems to be reliable. For portability, I should be able to use https://www.vbox.me/ to install the VMs and a host onto a flash drive and be able to run any of my environments from any Windows host without additional installations. Haven't actually tried this yet (happily, I no longer have easy access to Windows machines!), but it was a big point in favor.

Xen, which extends the kernel to support virtual CPUs with time slices. KVM, which assigns each virtual core a process that uses the Linux scheduler. When a hardware vm vcpu core is preempted there is vmexit call that has to reset registers etc... and it is expensive. Xen is what legacy AWS instances ran on and has advantages for being fair to guests is an easier task. KVM has the advantage of gaining the benefits of the Linux scheduler which is red black tree based and well optimized. When a new CPU comes out for example, KVM gains support from the upstream while Xen has to support it themselves. Once technology like cgroups improved the benefits of letting your thread complete and not be preempted due to the time slice expiring avoided the cost of vmexit. In theory, leveraging the inherently optimized core Linux features is what will also benefit virtualbox. Most people who use KVM are using an abstraction layer like libvirt that hides how it is implemented. In fact if you look at the processes you will see qemu even if KVM is how it is implemented. reply izacus 23 hours agoparentprevIt means Kernel-Based Virtual Machine, a VM engine dating back to 2007: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine reply viraptor 23 hours agoparentprevhttps://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page reply nonrandomstring 22 hours agorootparentIs there a connection to User Mode Linux (UML) from around the same time?

Ideally, I'd want a setup where the VM can access the internet (and therefore the HTB VPN), but not anything inside my local network. But I don't quite know how I could achieve that, at least in a way where I'd trust it to be reliable. Maybe the whole idea's a bit too paranoid to be practical in general, I don't know, so I'd love an expert opinion on this :) Usually, I'd be using QEMU, but I'd be fine with using VirtualBox for this case if it includes something that makes this easier. reply Manouchehri 20 hours agorootparentYou can probably do this for VirtualBox (and any Linux program) by using tun2socks to create a network interface that routes through a proxy (SOCKS5 if you want UDP support), and then moving that network interface to a new namespace.

Are there benefits to kernel based virtual machines beyond (what I assume is the primary benefit) performance? reply treffer 18 hours agoparentI wouldn't call it kernel based. It's not like this is an in-kernel emulation. I would stick with hardware virtualization. KVM is a userspace API, and kvm-intel/kvm-amd are the drivers for the hardware. You will be using hardware features. That's also why it is in the kernel: nothing but the kernel should have full unlimited access to the CPU to set this up. So you could say it must be in kernel to keep the kernel secure. And the performance benefit is \"just\" exposed hardware features. The kernel does not provide additional things. As far as I understand: you set up a dedicated memory space and handle traps that halt the execution e.g. when the VM talks to the PCI bus. (It's been a while since I looked this up) But you need the pieces, especially virtual PCI devices. That's where qemu or VirtualBox enter the scene (or minimalist systems like firecracker). They provide a repository of virtual hardware and all the auxiliary methods to boot a virtual machines. You also need to emulate something like a BIOS or UEFI. You can think of it as your CPU removing the need to emulate the very same CPU (and a memory controller). You still need to emulate the rest though! But running on the same CPU removes most performance penalties. You run at native speed. Newer generations can even nest this. Having virtual machines in virtual machines.

This basically means that you can’t use virtualbox and qemu at the same time. If you use virtualbox with this new backend, you can use it concurrently with qemu (and a few other virtualisation tools). KVM is also part of Linux itself, so there’s a lot less haste with setting it up. reply dijit 17 hours agorootparentvirtualbox drivers are/were a constant source of kernel panics on MacOS and Linux too, so that should not be underestimated. IIRC they also disabled ASLR kernel wide. Additionally, and perhaps less important: USB3 is a commercial feature of virtualbox, there are stories of companies getting C&D letters (or Audits/Invoices) from Oracle because a developer had installed the virtualbox extensions.. reply gonzodaruler 17 hours agorootparentStarting with VirtualBox 7, USB3 no longer requires the commercial extension pack but is part of the OSE release. See https://github.com/cyberus-technology/virtualbox-kvm/blob/de... reply blitzclone 21 hours agoparentprevThe name KVM is a bit confusing. It doesn't do anything fundamental different than VirtualBox. The difference is that KVM comes by default with any Linux. VirtualBox ships it's own Linux kernel module for that. That has drawbacks. You typically can't use the newest Linux or the newest features. KVM also always has the hottest new (performance-relevant) features, because Intel and AMD will always build their hot stuff into KVM first. reply moondev 22 hours agoprevWoah.. does this mean OVA/OVF support for kvm? reply blitzclone 22 hours agoparentYes. reply moondev 22 hours agorootparentAwesome! Building this now, super excited to try it out. reply itvision 18 hours agoprevThis is awesome and great news, thanks a ton! The biggest issue however is that many Linux distros just refuse to build and distribute VBox kernel modules despite them being open source. Thank you for your work regardless. Do you intend VirtualBox to pick up your work and integrate it? I'm really looking forward to it. Have you already talked to the company? I really don't want this to be a one off work to potentially become decrepit and unusable going forward. Secondly, some VBox features belong to a separate closed source extension pack: USB2/3 support, PXE boot, VM disk encryption, webcam/camera support. Will they work with KVM VirtualBox after installing the pack? reply gonzodaruler 18 hours agoparentThanks. You can indeed use the extension pack with KVM Virtualbox, just make sure that you don't violate any license agreements. reply davb 22 hours agoprevThe blog post mentions an open source license but I can’t immediately see it in the post or the repo (perhaps I’m just missing it). Any idea what license this is released under? reply Daviey 22 hours agoparenthttps://github.com/cyberus-technology/virtualbox-kvm/blob/de... reply davb 22 hours agorootparentThat appears to be the VirtualBox OSE license, copied from the original Oracle package, not the license for this specific release. It’s unclear how this new derivative or work is licensed. reply blitzclone 22 hours agorootparentThe intention is to have this under the same license as the VBox open source release. If there is a way to clarify this more on the Github page, please advise. :) reply davb 21 hours agorootparentThanks for the clarification, that’s really helpful. I think a paragraph under a “License” header in the README just reiterating what you said in that reply would be pretty clear. I’m sure some people would make the assumption that it’s under the same license as the upstream package but in some environments absolutely clarity around licenses is really appreciated. reply blitzclone 21 hours agorootparentOk. We'll try to clarify the situation in the README. Thanks for the feedback! reply ylere 22 hours agoparentprevIt seems to be a fork of VirtualBox under the same dual license as the original project. reply jiripospisil 22 hours agoprevAny chance this gets upstreamed? reply blitzclone 22 hours agoparentOracle already had an unfinished and broken KVM backend in the code that was not exposed. Whether they incorporate this polished KVM backend is anyone's guess at this point. reply bionsystem 21 hours agorootparentHow is it broken ? I used it for a day recently (from ubuntu repo, windows guest) and it worked ok. reply blitzclone 21 hours agorootparentThe KVM backend in vanilla VBox cannot be activated without changing the code. If you tried it, you tried the vanilla VBox hypervisor (vboxdrv) instead of KVM. reply stephen_g 20 hours agoparentprevI’d actually much, much rather see it set up as a proper fork (rebranded etc.), and then the features that Oracle extorts people with in the “free” but not actually free extension pack (like USB pass through) re-implemented and included directly with no ‘extension’ required. Much of the reason I refuse to use Virtualbox for anything is how scummy Oracle is. reply organsnyder 19 hours agorootparentAt a previous employer Oracle sent a nastygram because they saw downloads of the VirtualBox extensions pack (which is free to download, but requires a license) coming from our IP block. This despite the fact that we were a big Oracle customer (tons of Oracle DBs; granted, we hadn't purchased VirtualBox licenses). I'd rather not deal with a vendor that's that antagonistic. reply sooperserieous 19 hours agorootparent> This despite^H^H^H^H^H because of the fact that we were a big Oracle customer FTFY. Having spent time at another large Oracle customer that was later acquired by Oracle I've seen how they do this internally too. And you can't just send it off to Legal to write back that \"we didn't actually use it\"... reply organsnyder 16 hours agorootparentThis employer has a massive network with a bunch of guest networks (it's a hospital chain), so I thought they could just say there was no way to know whether it was employees or not. Of course, IIRC they just paid the ransom and added new restrictions on how employees could manage their work machines. reply blitzclone 20 hours agorootparentprevHaha. I understand the sentiment. That's a pretty large effort though and needs some funding as well. reply codemusings 22 hours agoparentprevI mean it's Oracle we're talking about here. reply ilogik 22 hours agorootparent\"What you think of Oracle, is even truer than you think it is.

Webcam, USB drives, Hardware Video Acceleration, all working without issue (after a pretty tough learning curve getting it set up). reply orthecreedence 16 hours agoparentYes, I recently had to compile some stuff on Windows (I'm on an AMD Linux host) and VirtualBox just wouldn't start Microsoft's Windows dev VM (the one they provide for free for Virtualbox). I ended up learning how to use qemu and it works great...and as a bonus I was able to run a hackintosh (via https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM) and it works near flawlessly, which was something I was never able to accomplish with Virtualbox (granted I haven't tried in a few years). I'm pretty happy with Qemu now, even if it's jsut a CLI interface. I was tempted to try the virt-* stuff, but honestly it seems like one more thing to learn so I'm going to hold off until I need something like copy/paste between VMs and can't figure it out in qemu direct. reply curiouslinux333 15 hours agoparentprevIs bridged networking easy to setup? It's the main reason i use VirtualBox. reply nani8ot 16 hours agoprevThis makes me consider using VirtualBox again. Having to install and update a kernel module is annoying. Especially on some immutable/image-based distros like Fedora Atomic. reply bonton89 20 hours agoprevIs it possible to use virtualbox's accelerated video adapters with the KVM backend? reply gonzodaruler 20 hours agoparentYes. Don't expect too much though. 3D acceleration with Virtualbox is rather flaky (independent of using KVM). reply bonton89 16 hours agorootparentSure, VMware's is better but even that isn't really a replacement for GPU passthrough unfortunately. What I'd really like is to just get GPU accelerated video decode in the guests. reply Throw73747 21 hours agoprevDoes it support extra features from VirtualBox (machine snapshots, suspend&resume, multiple monitors, shared clipboard...)? reply bonton89 20 hours agoparentI do all of those things daily with virt-manager already. Except multiple monitors, although I believe it is supported. reply Throw73747 20 hours agorootparentThanks, it seems to support it (even through it is a bit DIY). Will look into it. reply gonzodaruler 21 hours agoparentprevIt does. reply downsplat 17 hours agoprevReminds me of the bad old days when I regularly had to open a crappy windows 7 in a VM because some minor piece of software would not run on Linux or on the browser. Thankfully I haven't needed to do that in years. On a more constructive note, this might be really useful for kernel developers, and for big companies using desktop virtualization. reply dehrmann 16 hours agoparentCrappy? Windows 7 was the last good Windows. reply downsplat 11 hours agorootparentYeah, any other Windows would have been worse. For me it was crappy because no-one wants to be maintaining a second hardly-used OS on their laptop. You randomly need it once in a blue moon, have to deal with two UIs with their conventions and feels on the same computer, and with copying files between them, and then and of course the first thing it wants to do is download tons of updates. Makes for a crappy experience. reply orthecreedence 16 hours agorootparentprevYou don't like being plastered with ads and news articles about Trump every time you open your start menu?? reply Sohcahtoa82 15 hours agorootparentI use Win10 and I don't get ads in my Start menu.

My machine came preinstalled though and whoever installed Windows obviously had a clue and turned all that crap off before they shipped it to me. reply tamarlikesdata 21 hours agoprevHow does it enhance security and performance of virtualized environments compared to the standard VirtualBox kernel module? reply blitzclone 21 hours agoparentWell, KVM is used by Google and AWS and others for their clouds. As such, there are a lot of eyes on KVM code. The vboxdrv kernel module that provides the same functionality in vanilla VBox definitely has fewer people looking at it. It also has anti-features, such as code upload from the userspace VirtualBox process to the kernel. This is also the largest security issue with vanilla VBox, because a lot of emulation code runs directly in the kernel. From a performance perspective, it's a bit more complicated. KVM has support for modern virtualization features (Intel APICv, AMD AVIC, etc) that vanilla VBox lacks. You get these in the VirtualBox/KVM version. On the other hand, vanilla VBox emulates most devices in the kernel (see above). So SATA emulation in vanilla VBox is very fast compared to KVM/Qemu or KVM/VirtualBox for a bit unfair reasons. Modern devices, such as virtio or NVMe, are not as impacted by that. tl;dr So the performance you get depends on your workload. If it's very interrupt heavy, VirtualBox/KVM will win. If it uses antiquated virtual devices (SATA), vanilla VirtualBox (with vboxdrv) will have an edge. reply peterhull90 20 hours agorootparentAnd could one swap between the two backends with the same VM image (.vbox +.vdi) to see which one gave the better performance? reply blitzclone 20 hours agorootparentYes! reply garaetjjte 19 hours agorootparentpreveBPF for in-kernel device emulation, then? EDIT: That was a joke, but actually it is a thing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTMls33dG8Q reply solarkraft 21 hours agoprevThat's impressive.

To answer: We are offering service contracts and contract engineering services around virtualization, KVM and a couple of other topics. The long term goal for this specific project is to support the security goals our customers have and to enable a couple of KVM features in Virtualbox as well. We plan to keep this updated with upstream Virtualbox and KVM. reply stevemk14ebr 17 hours agorootparentPlease upstream this code. That ensures this work will live forever with better maintenance without you all having to chase upstream vbox AND will be easier to justify use if it's an included vbox component. I would find it difficult to justify using this to my bosses \"lets just go use this custom fork of vbox\" isn't going to fly for most. reply oohffyvfg 16 hours agorootparentprevso, the plan is to take on docker hub? edit: nevermind. i assumed you were a team inside oracle. reply blitzclone 19 hours agoparentprevWe're offering commercial support.

If VB foss enough? Do you expect Oracle to merge this? If oracle doesn’t merge this, will you keep on maintaining it, potentially forking VirtualBox? reply blitzclone 21 hours agoparent>How does this work in licensing terms? If VB foss enough? It's as FOSS as the VirtualBox open source edition. > Do you expect Oracle to merge this? That would be nice, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Oracle gonna Oracle. > If oracle doesn’t merge this, will you keep on maintaining it, potentially forking VirtualBox? We don't intend to fork VirtualBox. VBox has a somewhat modular architecture where you can plug-in different hypervisor backends. That's what we did. It's not as modular, but our changes to core VirtualBox code is very small. As far as our plans go, we are pretty open at this point. We are very interested to get to know people that find this useful! reply stevemk14ebr 17 hours agorootparentThis would be useful for anyone who needs to run bleeding edge linux kernels. Most other hypervisors have poor support when you're pinned to testing distros (For security reasons). KVM and virt-manager are uh not exactly user friendly, so being able to use the KVM backend and always be compatible with the new kernels while having the UX and UI of vbox is actually a very huge deal. This is one of the main reasons I really really hope you all manage to upstream this. I built and tried this, it worked great, so excellent work there. I found the processor CPU core counts being grayed out unpleasant, it's not clear to me how I am supposed to adjust my core and ram values now, maybe document this? reply parthy 17 hours agorootparentThat's odd about the core count. I only get that behavior if my host system only has 1 CPU to begin with (tested in qemu/KVM with nesting). Could you comment on your host system parameters a bit? reply gonzodaruler 16 hours agorootparentThis is definitively not expected. You could also try setting the CPU/Mem configuration via VBoxManage. Maybe you get a good error message then. `VBoxManage modifyvm--cpus ` `VBoxManage modifyvm--memory ` reply stevemk14ebr 15 hours agorootparentUser error, I had to discard the snapshot state first - just like in normal vbox ;) reply stephenr 22 hours agoprevSo can this run/import existing vbox VMs? reply blitzclone 22 hours agoparentYes, we are switching between vanilla VBox and KVM VBox during development quite often and the VMs are fine with it. reply tyilo 20 hours agoprevDoes this enable you to use Hyper-V in a guest Windows VM? reply blitzclone 20 hours agoparentNot yet.

VBox has it's own module for hardware virtualization all along reply wtf_is_up 22 hours agoprevI think this should solve a current issue I have with virtualbox dealing with nested VMs. For example, nested QEMU VM running in a Virtualbox Linux guest causes the guest to lock up. According to virtualbox forum thread, only virtualbox-in-virtualbox nesting is supported, so to get around this I use virt-manager. But I think this kvm backend should solve it. reply blitzclone 21 hours agoparentThe KVM backend doesn't have nesting enabled just yet.

Secondly, support for new models is through their bindings with llama.cpp reply xyc 5 hours agoparentprevThe pace of progress here is pretty amazing. I loved how easy it is to get llamafile up and running, but I missed feature complete chat interfaces, so I built one based off it: https://recurse.chat/. I still need GPT-4 for some tasks, but in daily usage it's replaced much of ChatGPT usage, especially since I can import all of my ChatGPT chat history. Also curious to learn about what people want to do with local AI. reply jondwillis 4 hours agoparentprevI’ve been using Ollama with Mixtral-7B on my MBP for local development and it has been amazing. reply gnicholas 1 hour agorootparentI have used it too and am wondering why it starts responding so much faster than other similar-sized models I've tried. It doesn't seem quite as good as some of the others, but it is nice that the responses start almost immediately (on my 2022 MBA with 16 GB RAM). Does anyone know why this would be? reply regularfry 5 minutes agorootparentI've had the opposite experience with Mixtral on Ollama, on an intel linux box with a 4090. It's weirdly slow. But I suspect there's something up with ollama on this machine anyway, any model I run with it seems to have higher latency than vLLM on the same box. reply a_wild_dandan 10 hours agoparentprevI've always used `llamacpp -m-p `. Works great as my daily driver of Mixtral 8x7b + CodeLlama 70b on my MacBook. Do alternatives have any killer features over Llama.cpp? I don't want to miss any cool developments. reply livrem 26 minutes agorootparentWith all the models I tried there was a quite a bit of fiddling for each one to get the correct command-line flags and a good prompt, or at least copy-paste some command-line from HF. Seems like every model needs its own unique prompt to give good results? I guess that is what the wrappers take care of? Other than that llama.cpp is very easy to use. I even run it on my phone in Termux, but only with a tiny model that is more entertaining than useful for anything. reply te_chris 22 minutes agorootparentFor the chat models, they're all finetuned slightly differently in their prompt format - see Llama's. So having a conversion between the OAI api that everyone's used to now and the slightly inscrutable formats of models like Llama is very helpful - though much like langchain and its hardcoded prompts everywhere, there's probably some subjectivity and you may be rewarded by formatting prompts directly. reply Casteil 9 hours agorootparentprev70b is probably going to be a bit slow for most on M-series MBPs (even with enough RAM), but Mixtral 8x7b does really well. Very usable @ 25-30T/s (64GB M1 Max), whereas 70b tends to run more like 3.5-5T/s. 'llama.cpp-based' generally seems like the norm. Ollama is just really easy to set up & get going on MacOS. Integral support like this means one less thing to wire up or worry about when using a local LLM as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's remote API. Ollama also has a model library[1] you can browse & easily retrieve models from. Another project, Ollama-webui[2] is a nice webui/frontend for local LLM models in Ollama - it supports the latest LLaVA for multimodal image/prompt input, too.

Well, maybe you are, my dev machine doesn’t have the resources to respond on even the smallest model in less than an hour. I never tried to run these LLMs on my own machine -- is it this bad?

I'm fine with it emerging as a community standard if there's a REALLY robust specification for what the community considers to be \"OpenAI API compatible\". Crucially, that standard needs to stay stable even if OpenAI have released a brand new feature this morning. So I want the following: - A very solid API specification, including error conditions - A test suite that can be used to check that new implementations conform to that specification - A name. I want to know what it means when software claims to be \"compatible with OpenAI-API-Spec v3\" (for example) Right now telling me something is \"OpenAI API compatible\" really isn't enough information.

It's weird being beholden to someone else's API which can dictate what features we should (or shouldn't) be adding to our own project. If we add something cool/new/different to Ollama will people even be able to use it since there isn't an equivalent thing in the OpenAI API? reply minimaxir 12 hours agorootparentThat's more of a marketing problem than a technical problem. If there is indeed a novel use case with a good demo example that's not present in OpenAI's API, then people will use it.

The power of open source! reply Patrick_Devine 11 hours agorootparentYou're right that it's a marketing problem, but it's also a technical problem. If tooling/projects are built around the compat layer it makes it really difficult to consume those features without having to rewrite a lot of stuff. It also places a cognitive burden on developers to know which API to use. That might not sound like a lot, but one of the guiding principles around the project (and a big part of its success) is to keep the user experience as simple as possible. reply satellite2 11 hours agorootparentprevAt some point, (probably in a relatively close future), there will be the AI Consortium (AIC) to decide what enters the common API? reply minimaxir 12 hours agoparentprevThat's why it's good as an option to minimize friction and reduce lock-in to OpenAI's moat. reply tracerbulletx 10 hours agoparentprevIt's so trivially easy to create your own web server in your language of choice that calls directly into llama.cpp functions with the bindings for your language of choice it doesn't really matter all that much.

At work we are building a better version of Copilot, and support bringing your own LLM. Recently I've been adding an 'OpenAI compatible' backend, so that if you can provide any OpenAI compatible API endpoint, and just tell us which model to treat it as, then we can format prompts, stop sequences, respect max tokens, etc. according to the semantics of that model. I've been needing something exactly like this to test against in local dev environments :) Ollama having this will make my life / testing against the myriad of LLMs we need to support way, way easier.

It's nice that you have the role and content thing but that was always fairly trivial to implement. When it gets to agents you do need to execute actions. In the agent hosting system I started, I included a scripting engine, which makes me think that maybe I need to set up security and permissions for the agent system and just let it run code. Which is what I started. So I guess I am not sure I really need the function/tool calling. But if I see a bunch of people actually am standardizing on tool calls then maybe I need it in my framework just because it will be expected.

For example, Langchain has llm() which can work with multiple LLM backend. Which do you prefer? reply avereveard 6 hours agoparentI'd prefer it in library but there are a number of issues with that currently, the larger of it being that the landscape moves too fast and library wrappers aren't keeping up. the other is, what if the world standardize on a terrible library like langchain we'd be stuck with it for a long time since maintenance cost of non uniform backend tend to kill possible runner ups. So for now the uniform api seems the choice of convenience. reply Szpadel 11 hours agoparentprevbut this means you need each library to support each llm, and I think this is the same issue what is with object storage where basically everyone support S3 compatible API it's great to have some standard API even if that's isn't perfect, but having second API that allows you to use full potential (like B2 for backblaze) is also fine so there isn't one model fits all, and if your model have different capabilities, then imo you should provide both options reply SOLAR_FIELDS 11 hours agorootparentThis is hopefully much better than the s3 situation due to its simplicity. Many offerings that say “s3 compatible api” often mean “we support like 30% of api endpoints”. Granted often the most common stuff is supported and some stuff in the s3 api really only makes sense in AWS, but a good hunk of the s3 api is just hard or annoying to implement and a lot of vendors just don’t bother. Which ends up being rather annoying because you’ll pick some vendor and try to use an s3 client with it only to find out you can’t because of the 10% of the calls your client needs to make that are unsupported. reply mise_en_place 12 hours agoparentprevBefore OpenAI released their app I was using langchain in a system that I built.

The easy mode is that it will auto-load whatever model you'd like per request. They also implement docker-like layers for their representation of a model allowing you to overlay parameters of configuration and tag it.

As a matter of fact, it is likely that without lc we would've failed to deliver our product. The main reason is langsmith. (But there are other reasons too). Because of langchain we got \"free\" (as in no development necessary) langsmith integration and now I can debug my llm. Before that it was trying to make sense of whats happening inside my app within hundreds and hundreds of lines of text which was extremely painful and time consuming. Also, lc people are extremely nice and very open/quick to feedback. The abstractions are too verbose, and make it difficult, but the value we've been getting from lc as a whole cannot be overstated. other benefits: * easy integrations with vector stores (we tried several until landing on one but switching was easy) * easily adopting features like chat history, that would've taken us ages to determine correctly on our own people that complain and say \"just call your llm directly\": If your usecase is that simple, of course. using lc for that usecase is also almost equally simple.

    "title": "Accidental Blender VSE Optimization Leads to Major Improvements",
    "originLink": "https://aras-p.info/blog/2024/02/06/I-accidentally-Blender-VSE/",
    "originBody": "I accidentally Blender VSE Posted on Feb 6, 2024 #blender #code #performance Two months ago I started to contribute a bit of code to Blender’s Video Sequence Editor (VSE). Did you know that Blender has a suite of video editing tools? Yeah, me neither :) Even the feature page for it on the website looks… a bit empty lol. Do I know anything at all about video editing, timelines, sequencers, color grading, ffmpeg, audio mixing and so on? Of course not! So naturally, that means I should start to tinker with it. Wait what? How does one accidentally start working on VSE? You do that because you decide to check out Unity’s Unite 2023 conference in Amsterdam, and to visit some friends. For a spare half-a-day after the conference, you decide to check out Blender HQ. There, Francesco and Sergey, for some reason, ask you whether you’d like to contribute to VSE, and against your better judgement, you say “maybe?”. So that’s how. And then it feels pretty much like this: I started to tinker with it, mostly trying to do random “easy” things. By easy, I mean performance optimizations. Since, unless the code complexicates a lot, they are hard to argue against. “Here, this thing is 2x faster now”, in most places everyone will react with “oh nice!\". Hopefully. So, two months of kinda-partime tinkering in this area that I did not even know existed before, and Blender VSE got a small set of improvements for upcoming Blender 4.1 (which just became beta and can be downloaded from usual daily builds). Here they are: Snappier Timeline drawing VSE timeline is the bottom part of the image above. Here it is zoomed out into the complete Sprite Fright edit project, with about 3000 “strips” visible at once. Just scrolling and panning around in that timeline was updating the user interface at ~15 frames per second. Now that’s 60+ frames per second (#115311). Turns out, submitting graphics API draw calls two triangles at a time is not the fastest approach, heh. Here’s that process visualized inside the most excellent Superluminal profiler – pretty much all the time is spent inside “begin drawing one quad” and “finish drawing one quad” functions 🤦 As part of that, audio waveforms display also got some weirdness about it fixed, some UI polish tweaks, and now is on by default (#115274). Scopes VSE has options to display typical “scopes” you might expect: image histogram, waveform, vectorscope. Here’s their look, “before” on the left side, “now” on the right. Histogram was drawn as pixelated image, with very saturated colors. Draw as nicer polygons, with a grid, and less saturation (#116798): Waveform (here shown in “parade” option) was saturating very quickly. Oh, and make it 15x faster with some multi-threading (#115579). Vectorscope’s outer color hexagon looked very 90s with all the pixelation. Copy the updated image editor vectorscope design, and voilà (#117738): While at it, the “show overexposed regions” (“zebra stripes”) option was also sped up 2x-3x (#115622). All these scopes (and image editor scopes) should at some point be done on the GPU with compute shaders, of course. Someday. ffmpeg bits Blender primarily uses ffmpeg libraries for audio/video reading and writing. That suite is famous for the extremely flexible and somewhat intimidating command line tooling, but within Blender the actual code libraries like libavcodec are used. Among other things, libswscale is used to do movie frame RGB↔YUV conversion. Turns out, libswscale can do those parts multi-threaded for a while by now, it’s just not exactly intuitive how to achieve that. Previous code was like: // init SwsContext *ctx = sws_getContext(...); // convert RGB->YUV sws_scale(ctx, ...); but that ends up doing the conversion completely single-threaded. There is a \"threads\" parameter that you can set on the context, to make it be able to multi-thread the conversion operation. But that parameter has to be set at initialization time, which means you can no longer use sws_getContext(), and instead you have to initialize the context the hard way: SwsContext *get_threaded_sws_context(int width,int height,AVPixelFormat src_format,AVPixelFormat dst_format) { /* sws_getContext does not allow passing flags that ask for multi-threaded * scaling context, so do it the hard way. */ SwsContext *c = sws_alloc_context(); if (c == nullptr) { return nullptr; } av_opt_set_int(c, \"srcw\", width, 0); av_opt_set_int(c, \"srch\", height, 0); av_opt_set_int(c, \"src_format\", src_format, 0); av_opt_set_int(c, \"dstw\", width, 0); av_opt_set_int(c, \"dsth\", height, 0); av_opt_set_int(c, \"dst_format\", dst_format, 0); av_opt_set_int(c, \"sws_flags\", SWS_BICUBIC, 0); av_opt_set_int(c, \"threads\", BLI_system_thread_count(), 0); if (sws_init_context(c, nullptr, nullptr) < 0) { sws_freeContext(c); return nullptr; } return c; } And you’d think that’s enough? Haha, of course not. sws_scale() never does multi-threading internally. For that, you need to use sws_scale_frame() instead. And once you do, it crashes since it turns out that you have had created your AVFrame objects just a tiny bit wrong that was completely fine for sws_scale, but is very much not fine for sws_scale_frame since the latter tries to do various sorts of reference counting and whatnot. Kids, do not design APIs like this! So all that took a while to figure out, but phew, done (#116008), and the RGB→YUV conversion step while writing a movie file is quite a bit faster now. And then do the same in the other direction, i.e. when reading a movie file, use multi-threaded YUV→RGB conversion, and fold vertical flip into the same operation as well (#116309). Audio resampling While looking at where time is spent while rendering a movie out of VSE, I noticed a this feels excessive moment where almost half of the time that takes to “produce a video or audio frame” is spent inside the audio library used by Blender (Audaspace). Not in encoding audio, just in mixing it before encoding! Turns out, most of that time is spent in resampling audio clip data, for example the movie is set to 48kHz audio, but some of the audio strips are 44.1kHz or similar. I started to dig in. Audaspace, the audio engine, had two modes that it could do sound resampling: for inside-blender playback, it was using Linear resampler, which just linearly interpolates between samples. For rendering a movie, it was using Julius O Smith’s algorithm with, what it feels like, “uhh, somewhat overkill” parameter sizes. One way to look at resampler quality is to take a synthetic sound, e.g. one that has a single increasing frequency, resample it, and look at the spectrogram of it. Here’s a “sweeping frequencies” sound, resampled inside Audacity with “best”, “medium” and “low” resampling settings. What you want is the result that looks like the “best” one, i.e. as little additional frequencies introduced as possible. Inside Blender, Audaspace was providing two options: rendering vs. preview playback. Rendering one is good spectrogram indeed, whereas preview, while being fast to compute resampling, does introduce a lot of extra frequencies. What I have done, is add a new “medium” resampling quality setting to Audaspace that, as far as I can tell, produces pretty much the same result while being about 3x faster to calculate. And made Blender use that when rendering: With that, rendering a portion (2000 frames) of Sprite Fright on Windows Ryzen 5950X PC went 92sec→73 sec (#116059). And I’ve learned a thing or two about audio resampling. Not bad! Image transformations and filtering Strips that produce a visual (images, movies, text, scenes, …) in Blender VSE can be transformed: positioned, rotated, scaled, and additional cropping can be applied. Whenever that happens, the image that is normally produced by the strip is transformed into a new one. All of that is done on the CPU, and was multi-threaded already. Yet it had some issues/bugs, and parts of the code could be optimized a bit. Plus some other things could be done. “Why all of that is done on the CPU?!” you might ask. Good question! Part of the reason is, that no one made it be done on the GPU. Another part, is that the CPU fallback still needs to exist (at least right now), for the use case of: user wants to render things on a render farm that has no GPU. “Off by half a pixel” errors The code had various “off by half a pixel” errors that in many cases cancel themselves out or are invisible. Until they are not. This is not too dissimilar to “half texel offset” things that everyone had to go through in DirectX 9 times when doing any sort of image postprocessing. Felt like youth again :) E.g. scaling a tiny image up 16x using Nearest and Bilinear filtering, respectively: The Bilinear filter shifts the image by half the source pixel! (there’s also magenta – which is background color here – sneaking in; about that later) In the other direction, scaling this image down exactly by 2x using Bilinear filtering does no filtering at all! So things like that (as well as other “off by something” errors in other filters) got fixed (#116628). And the images above look like this with Bilinear 16x upscaling and 2x downscaling: Transparency border around Bilinear filtering VSE had three filtering options in Blender 4.0 and earlier: Nearest, Bilinear and Subsampled3x3. Of those, only the Bilinear one was adding half a source texel worth of transparency around the resulting image. Which is somewhat visible if you are scaling your media up. Why this discrepancy, no one remembers at this point, but it was there “forever”, it seems. There’s a similar issue in Blender (CPU) Compositor, where Bilinear sampling of something blends in “transparency” when right on the edge of an image, whereas Bicubic sampling does not. Again, no one remembers why, and that should be addressed by someone. Someday. I removed that “blend into transparency” from bilinear filtering code that is used by VSE. However! A side effect of this transparency thing, is that if you do not scale your image but only rotate it, the edge does get some sort of anti-aliasing. Which it would be losing now, if just removing that from bilinear. So instead of blending in transparency when filtering the source image, instead I apply some sort of “transparency anti-aliasing” to the edge pixels of the destination image (#117717). Filtering additions and changes Regular VSE strip transforms did not have a cubic filtering option (it only existed in the special Transform Effect strip), which sounded like a curious omission. And that led into a rabbit hole of trying to figure out what exactly does Blender mean when they say “bicubic”, as well as what other software means by “bicubic”. It’s quite a mess lol! See an interactive comparison I made here: aras-p.info/img/misc/upsample_filter_comp_2024 Anyway, “Bicubic” everywhere within Blender actually means “Cubic B-Spline” filtering, i.e. Mitchell-Netravali filter with B=1, C=0 coefficients, also known as “no ringing, but lots of blur”. Whether that’s a good choice depends on use case and what do the images represent. For VSE specifically, it sounded like the usual “Mitchell” filter (B=C=1/3) might have been better. Here’s both of them for example: Both kinds of cubic filtering are an option in VSE now (#117100, #117517). For downscaling the image, Blender 3.5 added a “Subsampled 3x3” filter. What it actually is, is a box filter that is hardcoded to 3x3 size. Whether box filter is a good filter, is a question for another day. But for now at least, I made it not be hardcoded to fixed 3x3 size (#117584), since if you scale the image down by not 3x3, it kinda starts to break down. Here, downscaling this perspective grid by 4x on each axis: original image, downscaled with current Subsampled 3x3 filter, and downscaled with the adjusted Box filter. Slightly better: All of that is a lot of choices for the user, TBH! So I added an “Auto” filter option (#117853), that is now the default for VSE strips. It automatically picks the “most appropriate” filter based on transform data: When there is no scaling or rotation: Nearest, When scaling up by more than 2x: Cubic Mitchell, When scaling down by more than 2x: Box, Otherwise: Bilinear. Besides all that, the image filtering process got a bit faster: Get rid of virtual functions from the inner loop, and some SIMD for bilinear filtering (#115653), Simplify cubic filtering, and add some SIMD (#117100), Simplify math used by Box (née Subsampled3x3) filter (#117125), Fix “does a solid image that covers the whole screen, and so we can skip everything under it” optimization not working, when said image has scale (#117786). As a practical example, on my PC having a single 1920x1080 image in a 3840x2160 project (scaled up 2x), using Bilinear filtering: drawing the whole sequencer preview area went from 36.8ms down to 15.9ms. I have some ideas how to speed it up further. Optimizing VSE Effects While the actual movie data sets I have from Blender Studio do not use much/any effects, I optimized them by noticing something in the code. Most of that is just multi-threading. Glow effect: multi-threaded now, 6x-10x faster (#115818). Wipe effect: multi-threaded now, and simplify excessive trigonometry in Clock wipe; 6x-20x faster (#115837). Gamma Cross effect: was doing really complex table + interpolation based things just to avoid a single square root call. Felt like the code was written before hardware floating point was invented :) 4x faster now (#115801). Gaussian Blur effect: 1.5x faster by avoiding some redundant calculations (#116089). What does all of that mean for render times? On the three data sets I have from Blender Studio, the final render time of a VSE movie is about 2x faster on my PC. For example, the same Sprite Fright edit: rendering it went from almost 13 minutes down to 7 minutes. I hope things can be further sped up. We “only” need to do 2x speedup another three times, and then it’s quite good, right? :P Thoughts on actual work process Is all of the above a “good amount of work” done, for two months part-time effort? I don’t know. I think it’s quite okay, especially considering that the developer (me) knew nothing about the area or the codebase. Besides the user-visible changes outlined above, I did a handful of pull requests that were adding tests, refactoring code, cleaning something up, etc. In total 37 pull requests got done, reviewed and merged. And here’s the interesting bit: I’m pretty sure I could have not done this at an “actual job”. I don’t have many jobs to compare, but e.g. at Unity between around 2015 and 2022, I think I would have been able to do like 30% of the above in the same time. Maybe less. I probably could have done the above at “ancient” Unity, i.e. around year 2010 or so. The reasons are numerous and complex, and have to do with amount of people within the company, processes, expectations, communication, politics and whatnot. But it is weirdly funny, that if I’m able to do “X amount of work in Y amount of time” for free, then at a company where it would pay me relatively lotsa money for the work, various forces would try to make me do the same work slower. Or not finish the work at all, since due to (again, complex reasons) the effort might get cancelled midway! I hope Blender does not venture into that size/complexity/workflow where it feels like The Process is not helping, but rather is there to demotivate and slow down everyone (not on purpose! it just slowly becomes that way). What’s next? Who knows! Blender 4.1 just became beta, which means feature-wise, it is “done” and the VSE related bits in 4.1 are going to be as they are right now. However, work on Blender 4.2 starts now, and then 4.3, … For the near future, I want to keep tinkering with it. But without a clear plan :) Once I have something done, maybe I’ll write about them. Meanwhile, things can be observed in the Weekly Updates forum section. Until next time!

I have experienced this my entire life and it has caused me to question everything people say about motivation, such as the idea that profit and wages are the only way to get things done. Then I came across Karl Marx's theory of alienation and things started to make a lot more sense. He started from the observation that work is the main thing that (healthy) people do, but that this should not be confused with working for other people and being alienated from the product of one's own labor. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx's_theory_of_alienation reply JellyBeanThief 9 hours agorootparentI've started trying to be more specific about what I mean by \"work\", \"hard work\", and \"play\" when I think about stuff. \"Work\" is anything that must be done regardless of whether it is enjoyable. That includes things I do for myself as well as other people. Doing the dishes is work, even if I enjoy the zen of it. Automating a repetitive process at work is work, even if I enjoy the flow of it. \"Hard work\" is anything that must be done even though mind and body say \"this is bad for you, keep doing this only if it's really important\" using the vocabulary of pain, exhaustion, boredom, resentment, anxiety, and so on. What's hard work for me might not be for someone else, and what's hard work for them might not be for me. What's hard work for both of us is likely to be a source of struggle to get the other person to do it. \"Play\" is anything that doesn't need to be done, regardless of whether it is enjoyable. If you want a \"hard work\" equivalent of play, maybe striving play? Either way, it is worth distinguishing from work because the condition of not needing to succeed relaxes inhibitions on creativity, experimentation, and novel behavior. There's a bunch of dimensions in all of these that I need to untangle. But one thing I really like is the detachment of enjoyability from whether or not something is work or play. I have to go to a party to bond with coworkers. I might enjoy it, it might involve games and feelings of connection, but it is work because I need to do it to maintain my security of food and shelter and yada yada, and I will be putting a face on. reply anamax 9 hours agorootparentOne of work's important dimensions is \"are you being paid?\" which can be generalized to \"I'm doing this because of some external factor\" such as in \"clothes don't clean themselves.\" \"do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life\" doesn't take into account that external factors have some influence on what you do whenever they are present. reply nox101 6 hours agorootparentprevI get way more done when i'm self motivated but, the things that I'm doing at work actually need to be done.

Additionally, it performs a full frame-by-frame render even when re-encoding isn’t necessary, unlike DaVinci Resolve which can bypass this process. Enhancements in this area would be greatly beneficial for Blender’s performance and efficiency. reply AkBKukU 11 hours agoparentprevOne problem is Blender's multithreaded rendering doesn't scale well to VSE work because it focuses on breaking up each frame and as a result doesn't well utilize multiple cores. I've experimented with making a plugin [1] in the past to start multiple render jobs different points in the timeline in separate processes and was able to massively speed up renders. I have since switched to Resolve on linux as well but due to using Blackmagic cameras that work better with it.

    "title": "Microsoft Introduces Sudo for Windows in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build",
    "originLink": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows/",
    "originBody": "Introducing Sudo for Windows! Jordi Adoumie February 7th, 20246 7 Introducing Sudo for Windows We’re excited to announce the release of Sudo for Windows in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26052! Sudo for Windows is a new way for users to run elevated commands directly from an unelevated console session. It is an ergonomic and familiar solution for users who want to elevate a command without having to first open a new elevated console. We are also excited to announce that we are open-sourcing this project here on GitHub! We’re working hard to add more information about the project in the GitHub repo and will be sharing more details about our plans in the coming months! If you’re looking for additional functionality that Sudo for Windows does not provide, check out Gerardo Grignoli’s gsudo which has a number of additional features and configuration options. You can also check out the Microsoft Learn docs for more information here. How to enable Sudo for Windows To enable Sudo for Windows, navigate to the Settings > For Developers page in Windows Settings and toggle on the “Enable Sudo” option: You can alternatively enable Sudo for Windows by running the following command in an elevated console session: Copy sudo config --enableHow to configure Sudo for Windows Sudo for Windows currently supports three different configuration options: In a new window (forceNewWindow) Input closed (disableInput) Inline (normal) To change the configuration option, use the drop-down menu in the Settings > For Developers page in Windows Settings: You can alternatively change the configuration option by running the following command in an elevated console session: Copy sudo config --enableConfiguration Option 1: In a New Window In this configuration, Sudo for Windows will open a new elevated console window and run the command in that window. This is the default configuration option when sudo is enabled. For example, if you run: Copy sudo netstat -ab A new window will open and the command will be run in that window: Configuration Option 2: Input Closed In this configuration, Sudo for Windows will run the elevated process in the current window, but the new process will be spawned with its stdin closed. This means that the new process will not accept any user input, so this configuration will not work for processes that require further user input after elevation. Configuration Option 3: Inline This configuration is most similar to the behavior of sudo on other operating systems. In this configuration, Sudo for Windows will run the elevated process with its stdin, stdout, and stderr all connected to the current window. This means the new elevated process can take in input and route output to the current window. How does it work? When elevating a process from the command-line with sudo, a UAC dialog will appear asking the user to confirm the elevation: Once the user confirms the elevation, the process will be elevated based on the configuration option selected by the user. You can check out the optional parameters for the sudo command by running sudo -h in your console. In a New Window In this configuration, sudo.exe will launch a new elevated console window and run the command in that window. The new window will be launched with the same working directory as the current window. The new window will also be launched with the same environment variables as the current window. This configuration has a similar flow to the runas command. Input Closed and Inline In these configurations, sudo.exe will launch a new elevated process, an elevated sudo.exe process, and the original unelevated sudo.exe will establish an RPC connection with the new elevated process. In other words, information is passed from the unelevated sudo instance to the elevated one. Specifically, the console handles from the unelevated process are passed to the elevated process which allows the elevated process to read input from the unelevated process and write output to the unelevated process. However, when sudo is configured in the “Input Closed” configuration, the elevated process will essentially not be passed the console’s input handle, so it will not be able to read input from the user. Here is a diagram of how the process hierarchy looks: It is important when running sudo in the “Inline” or “Input Closed” configurations to be aware of the security implications. It is possible that a medium integrity process can drive the elevated process. This risk is mitigated in the “Input Closed” configuration because the elevated process will not be able to read input from the user. Over the coming months we will be working on expanding documentation for Sudo for Windows and will be sharing more details about the security implications of running sudo in the “Inline” configuration. What’s next? Our team is working on open-sourcing Sudo for Windows and we’re excited to share more details about our plans in the coming months. In the meantime, we’d love to hear your feedback! Please share your feedback directly in the GitHub repository.

It's obviously not just a fork of the linux sudo - there's enough that's different about the permissions structure between OS's that just a straight port wouldn't make sense. But the dream of being able to run commands as admin, in the same terminal window - that's the experience we're finally bringing to users.

I'm not sure why people are being so critical of OP. reply jraph 9 hours agorootparentLook, I'm genuinely curious and we happen to have a MS dev here who could provide interesting first hand insight. I'm not critical. I don't have enough knowledge on the situation to share criticism on the topic yet. I could have added \"Could you expand on this?\" to clarify my intent. reply zadjii 7 hours agorootparentTo answer the original question: I've been at MSFT like, 8 years now? And this is probably the third serious attempt my team has made at Sudo for Windows. (I think I heard of a couple other attempts in my tenure as well). After the last attempt, my mantra had always been \"this is impossible to actually ship\". It's a tricky feature to ship, cause it is ultimately something that can be used as an escalation of privilege vector. Like, that's the entire idea. And there are a lot of people who (very rightly) get the ick when you say \"we want to add this thing which can be used as an EoP to the OS image\". So, it's kinda hard to believe that after four years of thinking it was impossible, we actually managed to get it out the door. reply rezonant 3 hours agorootparentPretty fair, especially since there's already tons of ways (albeit far less convenient) to accomplish nonmalicious escalation. Great work making this happen! reply jraph 3 hours agorootparentprevMakes sense. Thanks for taking the time to answer, very appreciated! You must be happy to have been wrong, ah ah. reply marwis 9 hours agorootparentprevMaybe until UAC is improved you can ship with a launcher process that is signed by publisher \"Unknown\"? reply neurostimulant 12 hours agoparentprevI think they should've named it something else to avoid confusion, especially if it doesn't have the same behavior as unix sudo. If it has different arguments and features, imagine the confusion of unsuspecting users searching how to use sudo in the future. reply jraph 9 hours agorootparentThey've done it with curl: they made an alias to their own program not supporting the same feature set and it inevitably backfired [1]. sudo is a complex program with a lot of different options [2] and as people from MS said here, it's never going to be compatible because of how Windows works differently. While I understand picking a familiar name, sudo is certainly not the only player, there's also doas. This shows people can adapt to another name and another name would have seemed more appropriate. edit: whoops, it was already mentioned in this thread [3] [1] https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/19/removing-the-powershe...

Whereas the real fully-functional curl can be installed and used on Windows, sudo is intuitively an OS-level program that deals with OS-level access control. reply JoshTriplett 8 hours agorootparentprev> sudo is certainly not the only player, there's also doas. This shows people can adapt to another name The fact that doas has far fewer users, and examples everywhere show `sudo xyz` as the way to run xyz as root, shows that people do not adapt to a different name. Microsoft has been trying, for years, to get developers to use Windows systems. This is another good step towards doing so. The answer isn't to use a different name; the answer is to actually support most of the sudo interface. But that said, there's a subset of the sudo interface that would cover the majority of what most people need on a regular basis: -H (change home directory) -i (act like a login shell, which may not be meaningful on Windows but could at least be ignored for compatibility) -E (preserve the environment) -u (set the user to something other than root) -g (set the group) -s (just run a shell) reply snvzz 7 hours agorootparent>The answer isn't to use a different name; the answer is to actually support most of the sudo interface. The answer is to do either. i.e. the complaint about using the name while offering a different, incompatible interface is valid. reply JoshTriplett 7 hours agorootparentYes, I agree. I do think it was correct to use the name, though, which means they should be more compatible. reply ninjin 5 hours agorootparentprevYou are not the only one thinking so. There is already a thread on OpenBSD's tech@ taking swipes at the obvious naming collision: https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=170742832804260&w=2 reply CrendKing 7 hours agorootparentprevI disagree. Although this \"Sudo for Windows\" is not a one-to-one port from Linux, it does the same function which is to elevate a unprivileged command. Imagine if they announce \"Introducing Dosu for Windows\", you won't know what the hell that is without reading at least the first paragraph. reply soraminazuki 2 hours agorootparentIn addition to not being a one-to-one port, Sudo for Windows is a completely unrelated command. > it does the same function which is to elevate a unprivileged command That's only one of the use cases of Sudo. Here's a description of Sudo from the official manual [1]: > sudo, sudoedit — execute a command as another user Sudo for Windows can't do that. It's mentioned in its FAQ: > the sudo command on Windows does not support running programs as other users Sudo for Windows is like a cat command that can't concatenate files or a touch command that doesn't update timestamps.

Linux and say FreeBSD are similar in this regard as well, lots of commands with same name but different behavior. reply jraph 9 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn't mean this isn't an issue, and that the issue should be worsened. Of course, it being an issue is an opinion (of mine), see my daniel.haxx.se link from my other comment next to yours for a motivation of this opinion. reply wvenable 9 hours agorootparentThe situation with curl is different because these are unix utilities you can run on Windows (hence the issue). Now \"sudo\" is not a very Windows-y name for this utility but it has the advantage of being self-descriptive by those most likely to use it. It's sudo... for Windows. You don't have to explain it further. The command line namespace is flat and there are only so many letter combinations, the idea that an OS shouldn't reuse a command name from a different OS is pretty limiting. reply jraph 8 hours agorootparent> The situation with curl is different because these are unix utilities you can run on Windows (hence the issue). Good point, the unlikeliness to ever run the real sudo on Windows makes it less an issue. Though doesn't remove it completely. You could for instance imagine a bash script (which you can run on Windows, since you can install Bash there) trying to use sudo if present, or something else, and fail because sudo is present but doesn't have the expected features. In shell land, the name of a command is almost an implicit contract. > The command line namespace is flat and there are only so many letter combinations, the idea that an OS shouldn't reuse a command name from a different OS is pretty limiting. In practice: - Programs are mostly cross platform so many \"commands\" can work on different OS. Which makes the command line namespace quite shared between OSes - I've not seen many clashes. I can certainly remember of one: the Chromium browser and the Chromium B.S.U game. It was unintentional. The \"sudo\" one is. You can certainly avoid it. reply al_borland 4 hours agorootparentprevEither way it’s done it’s an issue. Use a new name and it becomes a training problem, even for the most basic usage. Make it the same name and people expecting certain behaviors might get something slightly different. At a basic level, I’d wager a vast majority of sudo’s usage is very basic, “run this command as admin”. If it can do that out of the box, it solves for a vast majority of users and they don’t have to learn some kind of new cmdlet to be able to do it. reply jraph 3 hours agorootparentThis can't fully address the concern I raised. Their curl alias addressed the most basic / common usage and it caused issues. I also can't imagine a different name to cause such a training issue. We are speaking about people who learned using the terminal on Unix and are using it on Windows. They are likely at ease with computers. If they are confused by a name change, I can't imagine how confused they could be at the first difference they encounter. The same name might as well cause more training issues. I'm not convinced. reply Springtime 10 hours agorootparentprev> especially if it doesn't have the same behavior as unix sudo... imagine the confusion of unsuspecting users searching how to use sudo in the future. It's hard to imagine a company that size would name it so deliberately without realizing it would cause confusion in search engine results and such. A good faith assumption would be they wanted to make Windows more familiar to users of both but it also means that Windows will get mentioned in more Linux results over time to disambiguate it. reply herbst 1 hour agorootparentSo it's just some black hat SEO to seem more relevant to Linux users? reply timnetworks 10 hours agorootparentprev>It's hard to imagine a company that size would name it so deliberately without realizing it would cause confusion in search engine results and such. same microsoft as where I'm from? reply blibble 10 hours agorootparentprevthat's the standard microsoft way embrace (copy sudo), extend (add incompatible options), extinguish reply Anon1096 9 hours agorootparentI can say with 100% certainty that Microsoft is not going to extinguish sudo reply cqqxo4zV46cp 7 hours agorootparentprevThis really goes to show that no matter how legitimate a viewpoint (Microsoft is into EEE), there are always people looking to pretty unintelligently bandwagon. Yes, we know. Internet Explorer, yada yada. Beyond the ridiculousness of the notion of sudo specifically being a target for MS, the notion that MS, or any company of its size, is THAT single-minded, is absurd. reply Repulsion9513 9 hours agoparentprevWhy can't you do this with the tool that already exists to do the exact same thing, called runas? reply nine_k 6 hours agorootparentDoes it have a policy editor comparable to the /etc/sudoers file? Sudo is interesting not because it just allows to assume admin privileges for a moment; it allows to give access in a finely-grained manner, and not exclusively admin access. Just scrolling through the documentation [1] gives some idea. Examples in the end may surprise the reader with the variety of capabilities. [1]: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sudoers.5.html reply soraminazuki 4 hours agorootparentThis sudo for Windows doesn't either because it's not sudo. Looking at the docs, it's not even remotely compatible either. The choice of name here is unfortunate. reply mappu 4 hours agorootparentprevYou're talking about Sudo for Linux - today's new \"Sudo for Windows\" doesn't support a sudoers file. reply kazinator 4 hours agorootparentNo, nine_k is talking about the abstract requirements that are understood by \"sudo\", asking how they are reflected in this implementation. Sudo is widely understood to refer to a program which allows specific users to run specific privileged commands. reply cfinnberg 4 hours agorootparentprevI have noticed that runas is mentioned as an already existing sudo alternative, but as far as I know, runas asks you for the administrator's password. sudo asks the own user password. This is how you give a non administrator user the right to use some application/tool without revealing the admin's password. Or does runas work differently than I thought? reply flir 3 hours agorootparentYou're right, but on my work environment I have two accounts - \"me\" and \"me with elevated permissions\".

Powershell is a super neat language though.... especially if the Microsoft team that manages it would work more with the team that does more for SMEs and not just DevOps. The overwhelming majority of windows users doing regular business work have to deal with crufty stuff like VBA or over engineered stuff like C#. I was really hopeful for Powershell, but it seems like it's almost entirely to serve IT administrators or software developers. I wish that very capable team would do things like add a fairly simple GUI DSL or form designer with the tool. I know it can hook into WinForms, but that's a lot of effort and requires more C# background. There are probably millions of business analysts that would love to build little simple GUI apps without investing weeks of effort. The current approach is to just use Python, but that has it's own bag of problems for those that can do a little coding, but aren't full time developers. It just seems weird that Microsoft never invested in a language for SMEs that would integrate well with the OS and Microsoft apps and tooling. reply wvenable 9 hours agorootparentPowershell is a terrible \"language\".

As stated by someone below, sudo is https://www.sudo.ws/. Microsoft should give it a proper distinctive name lie wsudo or psudo. Little thinks like is compounds the issues with Windows / Microsoft.

Big name companies do not trust applications running on hosted Windows because of their current business practices. Microsoft does not even have a means to provided ease of deployment for air-gap system. This is the only way some big business will let products hosted on Windows to be in their facilities. Windows as become more problematic for me because of all the layers of security that need to be applied for companies to trust Windows. This causes issues such as having to stop typing because Visual Studios or VSCode cannot process key strokes in real time.

From my experience, it's rather driven from the need to look compliant. Thus, managers without in-depth knowledge decide to buy \"endpoint security solutions\", the more the merrier, deploy them to your machine, and that brings things down to a crawl. Why to a crawl? Well, I've witnessed multiple antivirus products go bezerk on your dev folder if you compile C++. Turning them off for this folder increased performance by a factor, which is what's typically done and completely subverts the purpose of these products. Also, I witnessed a certain product with a bird of prey that would run for hours and then just crash on a directory with a few million files.

I must be missing something here reply Isthatablackgsd 14 hours agoparentOpening a terminal in admin window which means any commands you put in that windows will always have admin privilege, no matter what. What does Sudo is to only provide the root/admin privileges for specific inputted command. Once it is done, it goes back to user privileges. This way, the terminal window didn't need to end the session to go back to user privileges. reply ikekkdcjkfke 12 hours agorootparentWhy is admin privilidge even a thing?

It also lets you elevate to admin without knowing the admin password, you elevate with your normal account password. Effectively, some commands can execute as admin, but the user generally cannot. So you can allow limited administration without giving everything away. reply bigstrat2003 10 hours agorootparentprevThat's like saying (in a Linux context) \"sudo is dumb because you can just use su\".

Literally, for like, the entire 8 years I've been here, we've been talking about if there was a way to do Sudo for Windows. This was done because it makes developers happy, plain and simple. If that's a KPI, then that's the one we're optimizing for. reply Repulsion9513 9 hours agorootparentThere are several ways to do sudo for Windows already, to the extent this program does sudo for Windows. In other words, you're not actually solving the reason people are asking you for sudo for Windows.

In other words, information is passed from the unelevated sudo instance to the elevated one. reply zadjii 13 hours agoparentYep, that's basically the entire diagram. The information that's passed is basically just the commandline, env vars, and a handle to the console of the unelevated sudo's console. Once it's got a handle to the console, the elevated sudo can spawn the target app attached to the original console, rather than a new one.

It also tells me that anyone who makes this comment has limited exposure to comparative kernel development. I've always said it, I'll say it now, and I'll say it in the future: the NT kernel is by far the best part of Windows, and it is in many ways superior to the Linux kernel. Furthermore, Windows ships with an absolute metric ton of very nice userspace technologies that either a) don't exist on Linux, or b) are rubbish to use on Linux. I don't understand why people want everything to converge on the Linux kernel and its userspace. I like open-source as much as everyone else, but 'let's make ALL the things GNU/Linux!' just leads to lack of competition and therefore stagnation and no innovation. I have a better wish: Microsoft should open-source core Windows technologies, and eventually, the NT kernel itself. Then, it could maintain its official Microsoft® Windows™ distribution with support contracts, while allowing developers to compile and modify WindowsOpen. Something like what it currently does with VS Code.

    "originBody": "Sayonara — Sony is erasing digital libraries that were supposed to be accessible “forever” Casualties afoot as Sony merges Funimation with 2021-acquired Crunchyroll. Scharon Harding - 2/8/2024, 9:37 PM A shot from One Piece, one of the animes that Funimation made DVDs for. Crunchyroll: Inside Anime/YouTube reader comments 180 How long is “forever”? When it comes to digital media, forever could be as close as a couple of months away. Funimation, a Sony-owned streaming service for anime, recently announced that subscribers' digital libraries on the platform will be unavailable after April 2. For years, Funimation had been telling subscribers that they could keep streaming these digital copies of purchased movies and shows, but qualifying it: “forever, but there are some restrictions.” Funimation’s parent company, Sony, bought rival anime streaming service Crunchyroll in 2021. Since then, it was suspected that Sony would merge the offerings together somehow. This week, we learned how, as Funimation announced that its app and website would close on April 2, and Funimation accounts will become Crunchyroll accounts. Most of Funimation’s catalog is already on Crunchyroll, Funimation’s announcement claimed. But in addition to offering video streaming, Funimation also dubbed and released anime as physical media, and sometimes those DVDs or Blu-rays would feature a digital code. Subscribers to the Funimation streaming service could add those digital codes to Funimation and then stream the content from the platform. Advertisement With Funimation claiming that customers could access these digital copies “forever,” I could see why someone might have thought this was a reliable way to access their purchased media. For people lacking the space, resources, or interest in maintaining a library of physical media, this was a good way to preserve treasured shows and movies without spending more money. It also provided a simple way to access purchased media online if you were, for example, away on a trip and had a hankering to watch some anime DVDs you bought. But soon, people who may have discarded or lost their physical media or lack a way to play DVDs and Blu-rays won't have a way to access the digital copies that they were entitled to through their physical copy purchase. Funimation's announcement says: Please note that Crunchyroll does not currently support Funimation Digital copies, which means that access to previously available digital copies will not be supported. However, we are continuously working to enhance our content offerings and provide you with an exceptional anime streaming experience. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to explore the extensive anime library available on Crunchyroll. Regarding refunds, Funimation's announcement directed customers to its support team \"to see the available options based on your payment method,\" but there's no mention of getting money back from a DVD or Blu-ray that you might not have purchased had you known you couldn't stream it \"forever.\" Page: 1 2 Next → reader comments 180 Scharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica’s Senior Product Reviewer writing news, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops, mechanical keyboards, and monitors.

Companies don't stay in business forever. A forever contract doesn't even make sense. But on the other hand, there need to be protections here. Just because a company merges or gets bought, doesn't mean they should be able to end their guarantees. What about if, to be legally allowed to license streaming content, companies were required by law to: 1) Specify a minimum duration available as part of the buy button and all other text using the term \"buy\" or \"license\"? E.g. \"Buy for 5 years\" or \"License now (min. 10 years guaranteed)\" 2) Require some kind of insurance/escrow/backup in advance, that guarantees that if they go out of business, all accounts and purchases will transfer to another service that will continue to honor them for the time period specified (or full purchase price is refunded) In terms of a minimum time duration, there are even physical analogies here -- books can yellow and their bindings crack and glue fail, vinyl wears out, floppy disks become unreadable after a decade or two -- I've even had CDs experience some kind of green growth in humid climates rendering them unreadable. So we already have a kind of pre-existing expectation of media purchases only lasting so long, on average. reply cuckatoo 6 hours agoparentLet's tie it to the length of copyright law. If it's still protected and under copyright then the obligation to keep it available exists. So if they want to keep extending copyright, well, it will go both ways. reply lamontcg 5 hours agorootparentAnd if they want to stop maintaining it, let them have the option of releasing it into the public domain and sending a digital copy to the library of congress or something. reply android42 3 hours agorootparentAt the very least I would also accept a DRM free copy being provided to everyone who had purchased it (e.g. at least one year or so to download it), and in failure to do that it becomes public domain.

We do to. reply crazygringo 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's a clever idea, but I'm not sure it really works because the company who owns the copyright isn't necessarily the company providing the stream to you digitally. This is about ensuring it stays available from the streaming distributor, and how much time remains on the copyright doesn't really have anything to do with them. And even if the copyright expires next year, I still want to make sure I can keep streaming it for the next 10 or 15 years or whatever, if I buy it today. reply android42 2 hours agorootparentIf the provider made it available for purchase (not subscription), the liability should go to them first to make DRM free copies available for those who purchased it before shutting down the service. If they are unable to do so, e.g. a sudden bankruptcy, then the liability could go to the copyright holder to find another provider to continue the service and transfer purchases, or provide DRM free copies (either should not be a problem if they are still making money from the given IP). In the event they are no longer making enough money from that IP and wish to just rid their hands of it, it becomes public domain. reply Repulsion9513 18 minutes agorootparent> then the liability could go to the copyright holder to find another provider And they'll choose the crappiest provider they possibly can whose website (no app, presumably) only works in some ancient browser and is \"down for maintenance\" 50% of the time because that provider has the lowest costs and is thus willing to charge the least for it... reply bcrosby95 4 hours agorootparentprevIf it expires next year then you could download it free anyways. reply SlightlyLeftPad 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is too easy to loophole out of and it leaves too big of a hole to patch.

I don’t see why they shouldn’t be sued. It’s not as though funimation advertised these leases as leases, they called them forever purchases lol. It’s outrageous these companies don’t advertise a period of time your purchase is good for and purchase insurance to ensure availability.

Some people will burn their books or toss them. Some will preserve them for centuries. The problem is that with purely digital, there is just nothing you can do. None of it is up to you.

It's still against the law in most places to violate copyrights, even if there's no DRM involved. reply bfdm 5 hours agorootparentBut it's equally important that where the copying would otherwise be allowed under copyright rules, anti tampering DRM laws (like DMCA 1201) make it criminal to perform or aid that copying. That's why DRM protection for its own sake needs to get tossed. It's a massive overreach. reply noobermin 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is why the analogy with \"wear and tear\" doesn't apply to digital goods, it doesn't even make any sense. Wear and tear is something that applies to physical things in the real world, not information, specifically information in a digital format. The problem here is not physical things that are the medium for information, it's the information itself that somehow people want to control. reply dr_kiszonka 8 hours agorootparentprevMaybe we should be given a lifetime \"license\" for the digital goods we buy. For example, if I bought a digital copy of a game or a movie and the company went out of business, I would be allowed to obtain and use a bootleg copy. Ideally, we should be allowed to download it from anywhere, including other stores, but that seems unlikely. reply PeterisP 3 hours agorootparentWhy only my lifetime? If I buy a copyright protected work, the doctrine of first sale asserts that I have the right to transfer it to anyone else, and if I die before doing so, whoever inherits me should have the rights to access to every single copyrighted thing I ever bought. reply mcmcmc 3 hours agorootparentprevJust to be clear for anyone who didn’t read TFA, the digital copies were given out as a bonus with purchases of physical media. Sure someone may have made a different purchasing decision if they knew the streaming platform would be going away eventually, but it’s not like they took back their DVDs. reply hndamien 7 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps anybody that uses the term “Buy” or “Forever” should risk the content falling into the public domain should they cease to uphold their service requirements of the contract they made. reply crazygringo 8 hours agorootparentprevSure, but that's a lot of effort. And if you want to copy your streams illegally or pirate duplicates you can do that too, which also involves effort. I'm just making the point that after 10 or 20 years, most people either no longer have most of the media they bought, it's degraded, they're upgrading from VHS to DVDs to Blu-Rays or similar, or they never touch it again anyways. Not true with all of it, but probably most of it. So there's already a kind of expectation that consumer media usually only lasts for a time period anyways -- yes, unless you're doing fancy things like climate control and making copies. reply jtbayly 7 hours agorootparentHaving AC and bookshelves is not fancy or hard. Books with decent paper can and do last centuries. Books with really crappy paper last decades and are generally still usable if you’re careful. DVDs last a stinking long time, too. All you’re saying is that physical things aren’t eternal. Yes everybody knows that. Digital things aren’t generally eternal either. I accept that. But look at the timeframes. reply advael 7 hours agorootparentprevMaking copies isn't fancy. It's just illegal because IP brokers have too much power and made it so. It's a commonsense measure that you could do with most forms of purchased media, increasingly trivially until said IP brokers succeeded in roping the government into threatening people who did so, and so now less people do so. To promise that a digital copy would be accessible forever and then rescind that access without offering a download is straightforwardly fraud reply tharkun__ 7 hours agorootparentprevThat is incorrect. We still have perfectly fine vinyls from the 1970s and that's just us. No climate controlling or anything like that.

A heavily played album does not sound the same as a new one. The rate of degradation probably depends to some degree on your specific turntable and needle.

It's trivial with backups to retain digital data forever. Even going just a bit further back in time books and vinyl can last a lifetime. What you are hanging your argument on is the lack of durability of optical disks a factor for ~40 years vs the inherent infinite durability of files forever after. We shouldn't expect infinitely durable things to emulate tangible things that wear out because it would be convenient for rights holders if it were so. The interests of rights holders is rarely aligned with the public. Its a multitude of barren fields that have never yielded anything because they are capable of buying art but not capable of making it. Even creatives have largely been compensated for their work many times over and are largely offering society bondage in return for nothing. More manure than fertile field. I suppose this is an overly long way to say fuck em. Instead of quite frankly over complicated nonsense just don't legally let people use the term buy if the company can by any means whatsoever reclaim their rights EVER. They should have to use the word rent and give a duration and that duration should be enforced. The simplest way to enforce this is if you use the word buy you cannot encumber the PURCHASE with DRM whatsoever. Current rights holders should have to provide a means to remove existing DRM. Failure to do so should imply forfeiting the entire purchase price. Rights holders that offer rentals and don't meet the duration should have to offer a prorated refund for the time stolen from users. The sky wouldn't fall. People would still make movies, music, and write books. reply AnthonyMouse 46 minutes agorootparent> We shouldn't expect infinitely durable things to emulate tangible things that wear out because it would be convenient for rights holders if it were so.

This is not even interesting because in practice all of the DRM is broken. The actual problem is that we have tools that prohibit circumventing DRM even when the copy is not an infringement of copyright (e.g. fair use) and that prohibit distribution of circumvention tools even if they're not used for copyright infringement, e.g. because the same DRM system is being maliciously applied to works already in the public domain. Or -- and this is the real reason this garbage is on the books -- the DRM is being used for anti-competitive purposes rather than to prevent copying. Because it doesn't prevent copying (evidence: all the content being on all the piracy sites), but it does prevent a legitimate competitor who actually cares about complying with the law from doing interoperability things that are not an infringement of copyright but are a violation of the DMCA. reply Retr0id 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I agree with that, and was going to add an edit to that effect but I guess I forgot. The way things are currently, the legal protections are stronger than the technical protections. I think it's much more realistic for legislation to be updated to allow copying for personal use, than it is for DRM to be banned outright. reply NegativeK 9 hours agoparentprevI agree with pretty much everything you've said. But the difference with physical media and streaming access is that it's actually legal to make a backup of physical media. It might be annoying or enthusiast-behavior to do so, but on the flip side, if a company finds out I'm making rips of streams, they'll at the least shut off my account (which includes access to the rest of the media) and quite possible throw a lawyer at me. Companies have done everything they can to nuke the idea of perpetuity. reply thfuran 8 hours agorootparent>it's actually legal to make a backup of physical media Well, sort of.

HDRips are likely either some 0day exploit in Widevine or a device which pretends to respect HDCP. Just about everyone archiving or \"archiving\" is torrenting. reply Retr0id 8 hours agorootparentI'd argue that the archival happens the moment the DRM is stripped, the seeders are just helping out with the data replication part - but I get what you're saying. As an aside, HDCP is broken in practice but frowned upon for archival, since it requires a re-encode, introducing generation loss. reply charcircuit 6 hours agorootparentHDCP itself isn't broken, but it shifts the problem to the next weakest link which would be between the controller board and the panel. reply Retr0id 6 hours agorootparentNo, HDCP itself is broken. According to the DMCA, and corresponding legal precedent[1], you're allowed to convert one version of HDCP to another. You can buy legitimate adapters off the shelf (provisioned with valid keys) to convert HDCP 2.2 to HDCP 1.4. No jumping through hoops, no legal grey areas (for now), it just works. HDCP 1.4 uses export-grade (broken) cryptography, the master keys are available on the public web. But you don't need to bother understanding the specifics, since just about any HDMI 1.4 sink you buy from China (whether it's a capture card or splitter) will strip HDCP 1.4 as a matter of course. [1] https://torrentfreak.com/4k-content-protection-stripper-beat... reply charcircuit 6 hours agorootparentYou may be allowed, but how would such a device get keys from DCP, and how do they avoid all of those keys being immediately blacklisted from being used for HDCP downgrades?

Yes, HDCP 2.3 is the latest version but HDCP 2.2 is all you need in practice. I can't talk from experience on 2.3, but I can on 2.2, so that's what I referenced. If you don't believe me but also don't want to buy any hardware to test for yourself, search for \"HDCP 2.2 splitter\" on amazon and read the reviews (but beware of confused customers who aren't aware of the difference between HDCP 2.2 and 1.4). reply charcircuit 5 hours agorootparent>They don't get blacklisted because what they're doing is explicitly allowed, and very widespread.

On one hand, that's kinda fair. Forever is pretty rough. On the other hand, companies probably shouldn't use the word forever when promising things then. I don't like your solution, because there's legitimately movies I really only want to watch once (actually that's the majority of them), and I'm pretty sure companies are gonna use the need to provide it for X time as a reason to jack up the price. I think there's a legitimate place for limited time things, but the deal should be up front and you shouldn't be using the word \"forever\". Also, kinda limits the notion of \"buying\" far beyond the standard english definition. \"Buying\" a ticket to a movie in a theater is perfectly legitimate, but doesn't really correspond to anything you're talking about. We all know we have to leave the movie theater afterwards and can't watch the movie again. This is fine, generally, because we know the deal going into it. It seems like the solution here is to have companies be up front with the deal. I feel like the easiest way to do that is to hold a couple companies accountable for the language they use when promising something, and the rest of them will be very up front, very quickly.

There are so many anime streaming sites out there, and word goes out pretty quickly when one gets killed and two others get up. Copyrights holders are losing the whack-a-mole game, they know it and are doubling down.

I don't know how these people can think like that (including netflix). I was so happy just to pay for something so I don't have to have the horrible UX of piracy. But they fucked it up so bad, removing movies I wanted to watch, pushing ads etc. that I'm back to a seed box. Weird stuff. reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agoparentprevI mean, they have to fight. If they shut down, everyone except the most dedicated anime watchers lose out. And I'm sure anime streaming is nowhere near as prolific as TV (some of which also serve some anime). I guess if people are fine reverting back to the 90's where they can barely share new shows with potential new friends, it's a better future. Sounds like a good way to ruin a lot of the respect slowly gained over the decades though. reply pdimitar 4 hours agorootparentWho has to fight? Sony? You seem to be implying somebody else. Sony is fine though, more than fine even, since they figure they'll just do their very best to be scummy. Obviously no business wants to roll over and just die, but if they fight super dirty and when their word is obviously not worth a dime then the consumers' reaction is predictable, no? reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparentNo one has the fight. But someone mad and rich enough could potentially fight. Or the right lawyer who cares enough to whip up a class action. Will it happen here? Probably not. Anime isn't that respected.

Perhaps this should be illegal: if you want to buy another company, you get stuck with the whole kit n' kaboodle. If the obligations are toxic, then don't buy it. We'd probably need a good regulatory body to investigate M&As though, to make sure some company doesn't split itself in half, with the good parts in one half and the bad parts in another, and then sell off the good part while letting the bad one fold. reply nhinck3 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is a little more egregious than the usual attempts. It isn't Funimation being bought out and dropping old liability. It's Sony buying a new company and dropping its own liabilities by shutting down Funimation.

Maybe they’ve changed but they seem alive and well - https://www.craftsman.com/ reply mewse 9 hours agorootparentIt's.. kinda complicated? \"Craftsman\" was never a company. It was a trademark under which Sears sold tools which they hired various tool manufacturers to produce for them. Black and Decker bought the trademark from Sears in 2017, but don't use the trademark themselves; instead, they licensed the name right back to Sears for 15 years for free (that license will expire in 2032), and Sears (now Sears/Kmart) is still using it the way they used to; getting tool manufacturers to produce tools for them and selling them to consumers under the Craftsman badge. So it depends on how you want to look at it? Sears never actually made the tools themselves, and don't own the trademark any more, but they're still the ones using the trademark and they're still selling tools made in the same way as they did before. So.. nothing's really changed? Except that the ownership of the name has been transferred to a different company. reply wlindley 9 hours agorootparentprevCraftsman is as dead as RCA. Those brands are now just trademarks, names sold to the highest bidder, not the company that built the quality products that the words now lead you into thinking they might still represent.

With a monthly or yearly subscription, at least you can calculate how much you're spending per unit of time. For a 'lifetime' you have no idea how long that single purchase will be spread across. reply davkan 2 hours agoparentLifetime is easily calculated against the equivalent periodic subscription cost if both are offered. I don’t buy a lifetime subscription thinking I’ll be using it in 10 years. I purchase it thinking I’ll still be using it in 3 years, at which point it starts being free compared to the monthly.

If I buy a book, and later find it missing on the shelf because the bookstore owner took it back and burned it, it's not a matter of refund. It's theft. This kind of analogy and language has been used to punish those who break copyright laws (particularly, by Sony, which also influenced these laws). That sword better cut both ways then. The executives should get prison terms for the corresponding number of counts of theft, just like copyright infringers did, and their victims should be compensated for damages, not what they merely paid. reply voakbasda 10 hours agorootparentThat would be the just outcome.

    "originLink": "https://ferd.ca/a-distributed-systems-reading-list.html",
    "originBody": "2024/02/07 A Distributed Systems Reading List This document contains various resources and quick definition of a lot of background information behind distributed systems. It is not complete, even though it is kinda sorta detailed. I had written it some time in 2019 when coworkers at the time had asked for a list of references, and I put together what I thought was a decent overview of the basics of distributed systems literature and concepts. Since I was asked for resources again recently, I decided to pop this text into my blog. I have verified the links again and replaced those that broke with archive links or other ones, but have not sought alternative sources when the old links worked, nor taken the time to add any extra content for new material that may have been published since then. It is meant to be used as a quick reference to understand various distsys discussions, and to discover the overall space and possibilities that are around this environment. Foundational theory This is information providing the basics of all the distsys theory. Most of the papers or resources you read will make references to some of these concepts, so explaining them makes sense. Models In a Nutshell There are three model types used by computer scientists doing distributed system theory: synchronous models semi-synchronous models asynchronous models A synchronous model means that each message sent within the system has a known upper bound on communications (max delay between a message being sent and received) and the processing speed between nodes or agents. This means that you can know for sure that after a period of time, a message was missed. This model is applicable in rare cases, such as hardware signals, and is mostly beginner mode for distributed system proofs. An asynchronous model means that you have no upper bound. It is legit for agents and nodes to process and delay things indefinitely. You can never assume that a \"lost\" message you haven't seen for the last 15 years won't just happen to be delivered tomorrow. The other node can also be stuck in a GC loop that lasts 500 centuries, that's good. Proving something works on asynchronous model means it works with all other types. This is expert mode for proofs and is even trickier than real world implementations to make work in most cases. The Semi-synchronous models are the cheat mode for real world. There are upper-bounds to the communication mechanisms and nodes everywhere, but they are often configurable and unspecified. This is what lets a protocol designer go \"you know what, we're gonna stick a ping message in there, and if you miss too many of them we consider you're dead.\" You can't assume all messages are delivered reliably, but you give yourself a chance to say \"now that's enough, I won't wait here forever.\" Protocols like Raft, Paxos, and ZAB (quorum protocols behind etcd, Chubby, and ZooKeeper respectively) all fit this category. Theoretical Failure Modes The way failures happen and are detected is important to a bunch of algorithms. The following are the most commonly used ones: Fail-stop failures Crash failures Omission failures Performance failures Byzantine failures First, Fail-stop failures mean that if a node encounters a problem, everyone can know about it and detect it, and can restore state from stable storage. This is easy mode for theory and protocols, but super hard to achieve in practice (and in some cases impossible) Crash failures mean that if a node or agent has a problem, it crashes and then never comes back. You are either correct or late forever. This is actually easier to design around than fail-stop in theory (but a huge pain to operate because redundancy is the name of the game, forever). Omission failures imply that you give correct results that respect the protocol or never answer. Performance failures assumes that while you respect the protocol in terms of the content of messages you send, you will also possibly send results late. Byzantine failures means that anything can go wrong (including people willingly trying to break you protocol with bad software pretending to be good software). There's a special class of authentication-detectable byzantine failures which at least put the constraint that you can't forge other messages from other nodes, but that is an optional thing. Byzantine modes are the worst. By default, most distributed system theory assumes that there are no bad actors or agents that are corrupted and willingly trying to break stuff, and byzantine failures are left up to blockchains and some forms of package management. Most modern papers and stuff will try and stick with either crash or fail-stop failures since they tend to be practical. See this typical distsys intro slide deck for more details. Consensus This is one of the core problems in distributed systems: how can all the nodes or agents in a system agree on one value? The reason it's so important is that if you can agree on just one value, you can then do a lot of things. The most common example of picking a single very useful value is the name of an elected leader that enforces decisions, just so you can stop having to build more consensuses because holy crap consensuses are painful. Variations exist on what exactly is a consensus, including does everyone agree fully? (strong) or just a majority? (t-resilient) and asking the same question in various synchronicity or failure models. Note that while classic protocols like Paxos use a leader to ensure consistency and speed up execution while remaining consistent, a bunch of systems will forgo these requirements. FLP Result In A Nutshell Stands for Fischer-Lynch-Patterson, the authors of a 1985 paper that states that proper consensus where all participants agree on a value is unsolvable in a purely asynchronous model (even though it is in a synchronous model) as long as any kind of failure is possible, even if they're just delays. It's one of the most influential papers in the arena because it triggered a lot of other work for other academics to define what exactly is going on in distributed systems. Detailed reading original paper blog post review (archive) Fault Detection Following FLP results, which showed that failure detection was kind of super-critical to making things work, a lot of computer science folks started working on what exactly it means to detect failures. This stuff is hard and often much less impressive than we'd hope for it to be. There are strong and weak fault detectors. The former implies all faulty processes are eventually identified by all non-faulty ones, and the latter that only some non-faulty processes find out about faulty ones. Then there are degrees of accuracy: Nobody who has not crashed is suspected of being crashed It's possible that a non-faulty process is never suspected at all You can be confused because there's chaos but at some point non-faulty processes stop being suspected of being bad At some point there's at least one non-faulty process that is not suspected You can possibly realize that a strong and fully accurate detector (said to be perfect) kind of implies that you get a consensus, and since consensus is not really doable in a fully asynchronous system model with failures, then there are hard limits to things you can detect reliably. This is often why semi-synchronous system models make sense: if you treat delays greater than T to be a failure, then you can start doing adequate failure detection. See this slide deck for a decent intro CAP Theorem The CAP theorem was for a long while just a conjecture, but has been proven in the early 2000s, leading to a lot of eventually consistent databases. In A Nutshell There are three properties to a distributed system: Consistency: any time you write to a system and read back from it, you get the value you wrote or a fresher one back. Availability: every request results in a response (including both reads and writes) Partition tolerance: the network can lose messages In theory, you can get a system that is both available and consistent, but only under synchronous models on a perfect network. Those don't really exist so in practice P is always there. What the CAP theorem states is essentially that given P, you have to choose either A (keep accepting writes and potentially corrupt data) or C (stop accepting writes to save the data, and go down). Refinements CAP is a bit strict in what you get in practice. Not all partitions in a network are equivalent, and not all consistency levels are the same. Two of the most common approaches to add some flexibility to the CAP theorem are the Yield/Harvest models and PACELC. Yield/Harvest essentially says that you can think of the system differently: yield is your ability to fulfill requests (as in uptime), and harvest is the fraction of all the potential data you can actually return. Search engines are a common example here, where they will increase their yield and answer more often by reducing their harvest when they ignore some search results to respond faster if at all. PACELC adds the idea that eventually-consistent databases are overly strict. In case of network Partitioning you have to choose between Availability or Consistency, but Else --when the system is running normally--one has to choose between Latency and Consistency. The idea is that you can decide to degrade your consistency for availability (but only when you really need to), or you could decide to always forego consistency because you gotta go fast. It is important to note that you cannot beat the CAP theorem (as long as you respect the models under which it was proven), and anyone claiming to do so is often a snake oil salesman. Resources CAP visual proof You can't sacrifice partition tolerance PACELC There's been countless rehashes of the CAP theorem and various discussions over the years; the results are mathematically proven even if many keep trying to make the argument that they're so reliable it doesn't matter. Message Passing Definitions Messages can be sent zero or more times, in various orderings. Some terms are introduced to define what they are: unicast means that the message is sent to one entity only anycast means that the message is sent to any valid entity broadcast means that a message is sent to all valid entities atomic broadcast or total order broadcast means that all the non-faulty actors in a system receive the same messages in the same order, whichever that order is gossip stands for the family of protocols where messages are forwarded between peers with the hope that eventually everyone gets all the messages at least once delivery means that each message will be sent once or more; listeners are to expect to see all messages, but possibly more than once at most once delivery means that each sender will only send the message one time. It's possible that listeners never see it. exactly once delivery means that each message is guaranteed to be sent and seen only once. This is a nice theoretical objective but quite impossible in real systems. It ends up being simulated through other means (combining atomic broadcast with specific flags and ordering guarantees, for example) Regarding ordering: total order means that all messages have just one strict ordering and way to compare them, much like 3 is always greater than 2. partial order means that some messages can compare with some messages, but not necessarily all of them. For example, I could decide that all the updates to the key k1 can be in a total order regarding each other, but independent from updates to the key k2. There is therefore a partial order between all updates across all keys, since k1 updates bear no information relative to the k2 updates. causal order means that all messages that depend on other messages are received after these (you can't learn of a user's avatar before you learn about that user). It is a specific type of partial order. There isn't a \"best\" ordering, each provides different possibilities and comes with different costs, optimizations, and related failure modes. Idempotence Idempotence is important enough to warrant its own entry. Idempotence means that when messages are seen more than once, resent or replayed, they don't impact the system differently than if they were sent just once. Common strategies is for each message to be able to refer to previously seen messages so that you define an ordering that will prevent replaying older messages, setting unique IDs (such as transaction IDs) coupled with a store that will prevent replaying transactions, and so on. See Idempotence is not a medical condition for a great read on it, with various related strategies. State Machine Replication This is a theoretical model by which, given the same sequences of states and the same operations applied to them (disregarding all kinds of non-determinism), all state machines will end up with the same result. This model ends up being critical to most reliable systems out there, which tend to all try to replay all events to all subsystems in the same order, ensuring predictable data sets in all places. This is generally done by picking a leader; all writes are done through the leader, and all the followers get a consistent replicated state of the system, allowing them to eventually become leaders or to fan-out their state to other actors. State-Based Replication State-based replication can be conceptually simpler to state-machine replication, with the idea that if you only replicate the state, you get the state at the end! The problem is that it is extremely hard to make this fast and efficient. If your state is terabytes large, you don't want to re-send it on every operation. Common approaches will include splitting, hashing, and bucketing of data to detect changes and only send the changed bits (think of rsync), merkle trees to detect changes, or the idea of a patch to source code. Practical Matters Here are a bunch of resources worth digging into for various system design elements. End-to-End Argument in System Design Foundational practical aspect of system design for distributed systems: a message that is sent is not a message that is necessarily received by the other party a message that is received by the other party is not necessarily a message that is actually read by the other party a message that is read by the other party is not necessarily a message that has been acted on by the other party The conclusion is that if you want anything to be reliable, you need an end-to-end acknowledgement, usually written by the application layer. Overview by the morning paper Actual paper Wikipedia page These ideas are behind the design of TCP as a protocol, but the authors also note that it wouldn't be sufficient to leave it at the protocol, the application layer must be involved. Fallacies of Distributed Computing The fallacies are: The network is reliable Latency is zero Bandwidth is infinite The network is secure Topology doesn't change There is one administrator Transport cost is zero The network is homogeneous Partial explanations on the Wiki page or full ones in the paper. Common Practical Failure Modes In practice, when you switch from Computer Science to Engineering, the types of faults you will find are a bit more varied, but can map to any of the theoretical models. This section is an informal list of common sources of issues in a system. See also the CAP theorem checklist for other common cases. Netsplit Some nodes can talk to each other, but some nodes are unreachable to others. A common example is that a US-based network can communicate fine internally, and so could a EU-based network, but both would be unable to speak to each-other Asymmetric Netsplit Communication between groups of nodes is not symmetric. For example, imagine that the US network can send messages to the EU network, but the EU network cannot respond back. This is a rarer mode when using TCP (although it has happened before), and a potentially common one when using UDP. Split Brain The way a lot of systems deal with failures is to keep a majority going. A split brain is what happens when both sides of a netsplit think they are the leader, and starts making conflicting decisions. Timeouts Timeouts are particularly tricky because they are non-deterministic. They can only be observed from one end, and you never know if a timeout that is ultimately interpreted as a failure was actually a failure, or just a delay due to networking, hardware, or GC pauses. There are times where retransmissions are not safe if the message has already been seen (i.e. it is not idempotent), and timeouts essentially make it impossible to know if retransmission is safe to try: was the message acted on, dropped, or is it still in transit or in a buffer somewhere? Missing Messages due to Ordering Generally, using TCP and crashes will tend to mean that few messages get missed across systems, but frequent cases can include: The node has gone down (or the software crashed) for a few seconds during which it missed a message that won't be repeated The updates are received transitively across various nodes. For example, a message published by service A on a bus (whether Kafka or RMQ) can end up read, transformed or acted on and re-published by service B, and there is a possibility that service C will read B's update before A's, causing issues in causality Clock Drift Not all clocks on all systems are synchronized properly (even using NTP) and will go at different speeds. Using a timestamp to sort through events is almost guaranteed to be a source of bugs, even moreso if the timestamps come from multiple computers. The Client is Part of the System A very common pitfall is to forget that the client that participates in a distributed system is part of it. Consistency on the server-side will not necessarily be worth much if the client can't make sense of the events or data it receives. This is particularly insidious for database clients that do a non-idempotent transactions, time out, and have no way to know if they can try it again. Restoring from multiple backups A single backup is kind of easy to handle. Multiple backups run into a problem called consistent cuts (high level view) and distributed snapshots, which means that not all the backups are taken at the same time, and this introduces inconsistencies that can be construed as corrupting data. The good news is there's no great solution and everyone suffers the same. Consistency Models There are dozens different levels of consistency, all of which are documented on Wikipedia, by Peter Bailis' paper on the topic, or overviewed by Kyle Kingsbury post on them Linearizability means each operation appears atomic and could not have been impacted by another one, as if they all ran just one at a time. The order is known and deterministic, and a read that started after a given write had started will be able to see that data. Serializability means that while all operations appear to be atomic, it makes no guarantee about which order they would have happened in. It means that some operations might start after another one and complete before it, and as long as the isolation is well-maintained, that isn't a problem. Sequential consistency means that even if operations might have taken place out-of-order, they will appear as if they all happened in order Causal Consistency means that only operations that have a logical dependency on each other need to be ordered amongst each other Read-committed consistency means that any operation that has been committed is available for further reads in the system Repeatable reads means that within a transaction, reading the same value multiple times always yields the same result Read-your-writes consistency means that any write you have completed must be readable by the same client subsequently Eventual Consistency is a kind of special family of consistency measures that say that the system can be inconsistent as long as it eventually becomes consistent again. Causal consistency is an example of eventual consistency. Strong Eventual Consistency is like eventual consistency but demands that no conflicts can happen between concurrent updates. This is usually the land of CRDTs. Note that while these definitions have clear semantics that academics tend to respect, they are not adopted uniformly or respected in various projects' or vendors' documentation in the industry. Database Transaction Scopes By default, most people assume database transactions are linearizable, and they tend not to be because that's way too slow as a default. Each database might have different semantics, so the following links may cover the most major ones. PostgreSQL MySQL (depends on the storage engine used) Transact-SQL (most of Microsoft's products) Oracle Be aware that while the PostgreSQL documentation is likely the clearest and most easy to understand one to introduce the topic, various vendors can assign different meanings to the same standard transaction scopes. Logical Clocks Those are data structures that allow to create either total or partial orderings between messages or state transitions. Most common ones are: Lamport timestamps, which are just a counter. They allow the silent undetected crushing of conflicting data Vector Clocks, which contain a counter per node, incremented on each message seen. They can detect conflicts in data and on operations. Version Vectors are like vector clocks, but only change the counters on state variations rather than all event seens Dotted Version Vectors are fancy version vectors that allow tracking conflicts that would be perceived by the client talking to a server. Interval Tree Clocks attempts to fix the issues of other clock types by requiring less space to store node-specific information and allowing a kind of built-in garbage collection. It also has one of the nicest papers ever. CRDTs CRDTs essentially are data structures that restrict operations that can be done such that they can never conflict, no matter which order they are done in or how concurrently this takes place. Think of it as the specification on how someone would write a distributed redis that was never wrong, but only left maths behind.

From a high-altitude view, that's why splitting a huge database table into smaller partitions is not an automatic performance win. If you have M partitions with N rows each, then a lookup might require O(log M) time to find a partition and O(log N) time to find a row within the partition. But O(log M + log N) = O(log MN) which is what you would get from a single big table with appropriate indexing. Of course, in the real world constant factors and implementation details matter, so this is just a heuristic.

What is the hello world/mnist of messing around with distributed systems? reply mannyv 16 hours agoparentThe easiest way is to fire up a bunch of VMs. The cheapest way is to pick up an old ThinkStation (or other tower), load it up with 128GB (or more) of ram and install ESXI on it. That's a perfectly good baseline, and you can run about 30 4gb linux VMs on it. Ideally you'd have a bit less than 1 core per VM, just so it's a bit slow. Lots of people assume your nodes are quick, but in real life they may not be. And really, most of the time your machines won't be doing squat. You might want to have SSDs in there too, because ESXI doesn't have RAID capability (or at least mine didn't). I don't think you can get a cloud device that uses spinning disks anymore, and you wouldn't use it in real life anyway. A 2tb drive is cheap these days, or just slap all those old small SSDs in there. Everyone has a bunch of those small SSDs left over, and they're perfect. reply Xamayon 16 hours agorootparentESXi needs the RAID to be handled by another device, the simplest case is a hardware RAID card with disks locally attached to it. You can also attach remote disks/volumes from other systems, with or without RAID, over the network/SAN/etc using an HBA, special network card, or the software iscsi initiator stuff in ESXi. You can even have something like a windows server act as the iscsi volume host, and attach to it over the normal network if you don't really care about reliability. The ESXi OS will not appreciate it if you ever turn the remote volume host system off, or if the network drops out.

But it is very DB centric. https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications... reply mannyv 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat you should read or start with are the designs for Cassandra, Kafka, Foundation DB, etc. The problems they're trying to solve are related to really large distributed systems that fail a lot, and their design decisions are basically a \"this is how we worked around that problem.\" You can also look for the LISA archives (https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/thirty-five-...). System administrators were the first people that had to deal with large distributed systems at scale, and university system administrators led the charge. You might want to hunt down the comp.sys.admin archives (I can't remember the newsgroup anymore). Most of the ideas and issues behind distributed computing are obvious if you think about it. Many of the actual implementation and mitigation of those are not obvious, though. And there's also the client side of distributed computing, which I don't think is discussed as much. As an example, exponential backoff is one of the go-to techniques for clients when the servers are under load. Unfortunately that doesn't really work IRL, because instead of spreading the load you get waves of load coming back over and over.

In the four-month period between February 23 and July 1, 2022, they crossed that line three times, NOS reports. All police units throughout the Netherlands have their own intelligence service. They work with the general intelligence service AIVD and monitor people who could pose a threat to national security. According to the CTIVD, these intelligence services sometimes receive a signal “about a person or a few persons” and then decide to investigate an entire community based on that. There are strict requirements in Dutch law for monitoring an entire community due to the massive invasion of privacy that entails. The intelligence service must first look into obtaining information about suspects in a different way and carefully consider whether such a broad investigation is a proportionate matter. Between February 2023 and July 1, 2022, that did not happen in three investigations, the CTIVD said. The supervisory body did not say which communities were involved but did explain that by “community,” it means a population group “based, for example, on ethnicity, religious belief, or occupational group.” So, theoretically, the police intelligence services may have been spying on visitors to a certain mosque or protesting farmers. The CTIVD did tell the “Stiekem Committee” - the parliamentary committee that supervises the CTIVD - which communities were involved. Harm Trip of the CTIVD told NOS that the police intelligence services monitor communities more often, but in these three cases, they did not give proper substantiation for why they needed to do so. Responsible Minister Hugo de Jonge (Home Affairs) said the police need to properly justify why they monitor entire communities. But he added: “I would like to emphasize that the approach of the investigations in all cases is focused on a threat perspective.” And then it may be necessary to get a picture of an entire community, which is allowed under certain conditions, he said. “It is inevitable that the ethnic background of people who are part of a particular community will be taken into account, but it is not the purpose of the investigation,” he said. In response to the CTIVD revelation, D66 parliamentarian Joost Sneller demanded a broader debate in parliament about better supervision of the intelligence and security services. SP parliamentarian Michel van Nispen is also critical. “We already knew that individuals have been followed in a sloppy manner, but it is even worse for entire communities,” he said.",

And I'm sure this still goes on. It was back in the time of the SLA terrorism and Patty Hearst kidnapping. One of the brothers in East Oakland casually mentioned to a cop \"What are all these hippies doing in our neighborhood?\" (It turns out they were having a strategy meeting.) This got reported up the chain of command and OPD intelligence set up traffic stops all around the neighborhood perimeter. That was it. They just asked for ID of everyone leaving the neighborhood and recorded them, with special interest in anyone White. When the sh!t hit the fan and the FBI got involved (soon thereafter) the OPD chief told the FBI they knew exactly who was involved. The FBI was dismissive and wasted valuable time. When the FBI hit a blank wall in regards to identifying SLA members they finally swallowed their pride and asked the OPD for the list. That's how the SLA membership was identified. reply echelon_musk 14 hours agoparentAnyone unfamiliar with the Patty Hearst kidnapping may want to read the excellent book Days of Rage [0].

It got much more powerful during the financial crisis of 2008 and the migration crisis caused by the Arab Spring in the mid 2010s. It’s not a mystery why people are pissed off and looking for non-mainstream candidates. A big mystery is why the far-left has vanished.

Filter down to people who were not fleeing or having a mental health crisis and you get 8 (26 including unknown and undetermined). While that still represents a problem in the use of force by cops, to say nothing of the idea that carrying a weapon (which is legal in much of the US) means that your death at the hands of the police is acceptable, killings of unarmed people seem far from routine.

If they’re not actively committing criminal acts, and there isn’t a warrant demonstrating with specificity that the particular facility or group is involved (e.g the same requirement for any other warrant) they should not be subject to any more surveillance than say a Christian group, or a Muslim group, or an lgbt group, or hell a group of sports team supporters. The amount of surveillance should be zero. I hate nazis with a passion, and would never be ok employing or working with someone who’s basic life belief is that a bunch of their coworkers (maybe including me?) don’t have the right to exist and are fundamentally inferior (if nothing else a cynical 100% capitalist take would be that having a Nazi anywhere in your management hierarchy will clearly open your company to plausible discrimination suits). Before anyone brings up accepting others beliefs, that’s not an issue. There is a basic social contract: you can believe whatever you want without consequences until your beliefs get to “other people don’t get to have the same rights as me”. The “paradox of tolerance” is BS used by bigots to try and allow them to attack the rights of others with impunity under the guise of accepting other’s beliefs. reply RamblingCTO 12 hours agorootparentIt's not about belief for me. People can believe what they want. But there's a sub-group of Nazis that want to topple the government and I think they, including all of their potential networks, should be surveilled.

I don't agree with surveillance because of simple beliefs or religions though. reply doktrin 14 hours agorootparentprev> The “paradox of tolerance” is BS used by bigots to try and allow them to attack the rights of others with impunity The Jewish philosopher who fled the Nazis was, in fact, a bigot seeking to attack the rights of others? reply Exoristos 11 hours agorootparentCan Jewish philosophers who flee Nazis not be bigots? What is the mechanism there? reply olliej 12 hours agorootparentprevNo. Popper was not using the \"paradox of intolerance\" to be a bigot attacking the rights of others. What Popper did was give a name to the behavior bigots were already demonstrating. Bigots don't say \"you have to support my beliefs because of the paradox of tolerance\", they say \"you are not being tolerant if you don't support my intolerance\" (for whatever group they're targeting). It's somewhat disingenuous to present an idea in terms of the circumstances in which it was introduced as being equivalent to that idea after people have had time to actually think about it and discuss it. It implies that no problem can be resolved in the time following its introduction. When Popper started talking about this as the \"paradox of intolerance\" it was \"how do we resolve this issue where a maximally tolerant society must inherently become intolerant\", but that was 80 odd years ago, and in that time the generally accepted answer is that tolerance is a social contract, and part of that is that tolerance is necessarily a two way street, so if your belief is that some other group[s] are not permitted to exist, or have the same rights, then no other group has to tolerate your beliefs. There is no problem of cycles of responsibility, because your intolerance was the initial trigger. reply doktrin 10 hours agorootparent> What Popper did was give a name to the behavior bigots were already demonstrating. Bigots don't say \"you have to support my beliefs because of the paradox of tolerance\", they say \"you are not being tolerant if you don't support my intolerance\" (for whatever group they're targeting). No, and no. He didn't \"give a name to the behavior of bigots\", and he didn't posit that bigots demand tolerance on rational grounds. In fact, he says something close to the opposite : \"...for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols\" > in that time the generally accepted answer is that tolerance is a social contract, and part of that is that tolerance is necessarily a two way street ... in that time? That description of tolerance is baked into his argument. The entire paradox, short as it is, revolved around the handling of (ultimately, violent) edge cases who don't care about meeting you anywhere. I'm not going to continue engaging in this thread, but just for general and future reference here is the footnote we've been discussing : \"Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal. \" -- The Open Society & Its Enemies reply anfogoat 17 hours agoparentprev> The article doesn't have enough details to form an opinion!

If, say, one member of a mosque is under surveillance for good reasons and then you extend that to everyone attending the mosque for no particular reason other than \"well, maybe we'll catch something, doesn't to try\": that's probably not a good thing. On the other hand, if the imam is preaching violent rhetoric, multiple members are under surveillance for good reasons, and there's good reasons to believe that the violence is an important part of the mosque community in the first place (rather than a relatively small detail): then that's perhaps not such a bad thing.

If you're really social, you might stick around for a coffee afterwards, but you're probably sitting at a table with the same few people every week. It's similar to a school. You might have a social group of a dozen peers you're familiar with, and you might or might not ever do anything outside of school with those people. There are also hundreds of other students in different sets or levels of classes who you might not ever learn the name of. Of course, it will vary between large churches and small churches, and probably between areas with lots of churches and areas with only a few.

What we see is mostly from the perspective of someone looking at Muslims - they are on the outside. A predictable result of the ignorance is stereotypes and prejudice.

Here’s why it’s stupid to think like that: 1) People are not borgs or hive mind enjoined entities. Yes, they may share beliefs or have friendship circles etc. but it’s irresponsible and reaching to believe that everyone thinks or will act the same simply by virtue of being in the same mosque or temple or church etc. 2) So because people are not borgs, there is a lot of factionalization, even in the same religious group, political party, Internet forum. 3) Even still, unless someone is actively going out to do something for some organization, you cannot penalize them for thought crimes by their association. Why? Because doing so usually leads to spread of authoritarian control. This is a rough response to your comment because people already know these things on some level. I think some people willfully choose to be stupid because of their biases. reply ricardobeat 17 hours agorootparentI never said anything like that. I’m opposing the idea that you should not look into that bowl because “not all M&Ms are poisoned”. I am strongly opposed to surveillance in general and happy that they unearthed this as a violation, but at some point people will inevitably fall into buckets when an investigation is happening. There is nothing new about this. A tip comes in about someone who frequents church X organizing a terrorist attack. Do you do a background check on church goers, look for suspicious activity, or sit back and twiddle your thumbs because this is “unfair targeting”?

Do you do a background check on church goers, look for suspicious activity, or sit back and twiddle your thumbs because this is “unfair targeting”? Obviously no one will agree that the situation you described merits inaction. Preemptive surveillance “in case there is a terrorist” is a human rights violation because no one should be deprived of their privacy. Privacy is fundamental to psychological well being, creativity and self-determination. Moreover, what’s to stop ideological enemies of one faction from sending false tips? Or to prevent progressive political action. For example, the FBI certainly considered civil rights activists as terrorists at one point (some still do, in different contexts). What if someone creates false flag terrorists to target a whole race? What if someone radicalizes someone by targeted harassment and stalking, and then blames their religion or culture if the target does something violent? Yes, violence is scary and psychopaths doubly so. The response to violence and psychopaths is not to sacrifice human rights. We need to understand people and create more social cohesion. I think this also means understanding and identifying psychopathic and anti-social behaviors. I don’t think killing people or locking them away from society is ever the answer because we will never run short of people to kill or lock away. We need less barbaric ways to deal with people, while also understanding the need for justice and revenge that being subject to such violence can create. The solution is not brute force surveillance.

I know about this because I built the search engine for this dossier (file) for the NRC handelsblad at the time, a very large Dutch newspaper (Before later building one of the first national search engines for the Netherlands, Search.NL (https://www.eindhovenfotos.nl/1/ilse.nl.html)). This caused a huge shit storm. Then there was a silence for 4 years, then they started again but learned from their experience. This time they shared the blame and formed the RIEC, an intelligence agency. The RIEC actually carries out their work through \"their partners\", police, council etc. This shared the blame, learning from their mistakes going on here. They also have deniability, they only give the partners instructions to follow, no reasons, they are instructed to keep only the bare minimum of information in their computers (Only what is absolutely necessary, which could in principle mean everything, it could be all done by word of mouth). So they keep that secret and the partners just do what they are told, doesn't matter how immoral it is. And finally, the organisation itself was formed without a human representative as the head. This technicality makes it be above the law in the Netherlands, you cannot sue an organisation if it doesn't have a human representative at the top. So the information about all of these activities are stored in computers by the RIEC, out of touch from accountability. This new structure was a success, and they have been undermining democracy ever since. This started around the end of 2005 and the formal organisation was started around 2008. When 9/11 started they started to empower the word \"terrorism\" to allow them to use the word to justify any new laws and powers they wanted. For the Dutch and this new approach they clearly saw the power of the word and came up with their own version called \"undermining\". And they claim that organised crime is undermining the fabric of society and in order to fight them to prevent this it's no longer sufficient to find evidence and convict criminals, now they need to intervene and take direct action against this. No evidence needed, anything goes. So now the government itself have become the organized criminals. And when it goes wrong, it goes horribly wrong and they simply cover everything up. This is where the press are supposed to be the counter balance for all of this. Unfortunately, the Netherlands have very good muzzles for the press and the press are no where near as proactive at printing stories about this sort of thing than they should be, so they get away with it and democracy itself is undermined more by the government than by the criminals. And the Dutch pushed this approach to neighboring Belgium and Germany who have a RIEC now as well. Why do I know so much about this? Because I was a victim of when it goes horribly wrong. In 2004, I bought a house who's entrance passed literally between 2x other houses. Then end 2005 the guy in right house was busted for growing weed and the the guy in left house strangely appeared to be harrassing him three months before. This harrassment spread to us simply because we complained. Then after more than 10 years of serious harrassment and criminality against me I forced the case to court. It took 5x years (So then 13 years later)! (https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180522_00062344) When it got to court, the prosecutor lied to the courts tried to blame it on me and then he retired, in 2018. Strangely there was a burst of prosecutors leaving their roles this year and no press investigated as to why (https://www.1limburg.nl/nieuws/1357826/leegloop-bij-justitie...). After this, once I recovered from the trauma, I investigated as to why a prosecutor would deliberately fail a case and that's when I discovered he was the former head of the RIEC and then all of the clues and events and people fell into place. And I discovered that he had lied in court before (https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1039807/liegende-officieren-...). The entire time this guy was actually being run by the Dutch government itself. I even took the police to court, they appealed, this also took 5x years and I won the appeal as well, I got to see over 1000 pages of police files, in there was evidence the the government were running and protecting the person doing the harrassing for more than 10 years (https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180221_00056384). The rest is a huge story, which I won't put here, but in any case there was absolutely no accountability possible ever and I did not put a trivial amount of effort into this. So much for the power of the press... Once I researched this it all make's sense. You have to find a stalking case suspicious when for more than 10 years of harrassment, attempted grevious bodily harm, theft and more the prosecutor only asked for 2 months conditional community service! WTF!! During this period, evidence vanished twice. The prosecutor had the role \"recherche officier van justitie\" part of whose job was to alignment with the head of team interventions as to what interventies they were going to carry out. The head of this department had migrated to be on the board of directors of the court of Maastricht before my case came to court. This same person (head of team interventions) is also implicated in a case where 9x innocent people were put into jail on fabricated evidence (Search de villamoord https://kro-ncrv.nl/programmas/villamoord), when she was the head of the organised crime unit in Arheim before moving to become the head of the organised crime unit in Maastricht in 2010, the time at which the police had been instructed to never respond to my calls anymore. The press were crap here, ignoring my attempts to get this published, mostly just ignoring all E-mails. No press in the Netherlands are willing to print my story. Mostly because they have ignored all of my attempts to communicate with them, but ones that didn't still wouldn't write about it.I even sent a message to the chief editor of the New York times about it who came to the Netherlands to talk to the press about how the press were the guardians of democracy. Unfortunately, she didn't didn't answer my mail. So much for that. So don't go thinking that there seems to be a lot of press on this subject in the Netherlands, there is no where near enough. reply nonethewiser 14 hours agoprev> So, theoretically, the police intelligence services may have been spying on visitors to a certain mosque or protesting farmers.

    "originBody": "Federal action on combatting auto theft From: Public Safety Canada Backgrounder The Government of Canada hosts National Summit on Combatting Auto Theft. Canada Border Services Agency The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) provides critical support to law enforcement partners to disrupt, investigate and ultimately prosecute these crimes. Upfront, preventative and investigative work—within Canada, ahead of reaching the border—is imperative to reduce auto theft overall. The CBSA acts on 100% of referrals from local police and works closely with governments and jurisdictions to intercept stolen vehicles and identify criminal activity within the supply chain. In addition, the Government of Canada is increasing the capacity of the CBSA by investing $28 million to conduct more investigations and examinations of stolen vehicles, as well as enhance collaboration on investigations and intelligence sharing with partners across Canada and Internationally. This includes exploring detection technology solutions, and exploring the use of advanced analytical tools, such as artificial intelligence. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Local police have the primary responsibility to investigate stolen vehicle offences. The Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, stewarded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), coordinates criminal intelligence sharing and analysis between federal, provincial and municipal police forces. The RCMP leverages port enforcement capacity in select provinces as part of its Border Integrity Program, helping to identify, assess and respond to significant inbound and outbound threats at Canada’s borders, at seaports, airports, land ports of entry and between ports of entry into Canada. The RCMP works closely with its international partners and maintains strong relationships with law enforcement agencies worldwide. These relationships are essential to Canada’s ability to deal with global threats, such as serious and organized crime. Justice Canada Ensuring people in Canada feel safe in their communities is a top priority. Canada has a robust criminal law framework to address auto theft at various stages of the crime, as well as its links to organized crime. The Department of Justice Canada will, in consultation with provinces and territories, examine potential amendments to the Criminal Code to further strengthen the legal framework related to auto theft, including by reviewing existing offences and penalties. Transport Canada Transport Canada will modernize the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards to ensure they consider technological advancements to deter and prevent auto theft. The Department will also work with public safety partners to identify cargo handling vulnerabilities through targeted security assessments of port facilities. Based on the assessments, the Department will work with port facilities on corrective actions and to implement updated security plans. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada will work with Canadian companies, and the automotive industry, to develop new solutions to protect vehicles against theft and to assist with recovery of stolen vehicles. ISED will pursue all avenues to ban devices used to steal vehicles by copying the wireless signals for remote keyless entry, such as the Flipper Zero, which would allow for the removal of those devices from the Canadian marketplace through collaboration with law enforcement agencies.

But in practice that's a lot of work. The reality is that most people don't want to be involved and are happy to have some figurehead do the work for them, even if that means complaining about it later. reply postpawl 2 hours agorootparentIn reality, those with significant wealth and power end up shaping policy. This can lead to public disengagement, as many feel the system is not truly representing their interests. reply randomdata 1 hour agorootparent> those with significant wealth [...] end up shaping policy. Yes, of course. Those with wealth hire people, often referred to as lobbyists, to put in the hard work. Technically, representative democracy requires everyone to be, or have, their own lobbyist, but in practice that's a lot of work that most people don't want to put in. They prefer to defer to a figurehead. It's easier that way. And, as such, give up power because of it. reply postpawl 1 hour agorootparentThe challenge isn't that people don't want to engage; it's that the demands of daily life, such as working long hours to make ends meet, leave little room for the kind of sustained political involvement that wealthier individuals can afford. When we say that people delegate their power to figureheads, it might be more a reflection of an unequal system that doesn't effectively support widespread civic participation, rather than a choice made out of apathy. reply randomdata 1 hour agorootparentOf course the system is not something that magically descended to the heavens, it is simply what people have agreed to go by. If it is unequal, it is so because the people have decided that they want it to be unequal. No doubt because, as you point out, the typical person would rather spend their time making ends meet (i.e. pay for the luxuries of life) than the worry about making agreements with their neighbours day-in, day-out. You can technically survive on very little time commitment to \"make ends meet\". Just look at the homeless population. It is not a life you would want to live, but it could be done if you truly saw the need to assert your power. But, understandably, most people would rather focus on their personal goals and let the figurehead worry about the community problems. What's the alternative? It's just people at the end of the day. There is no magic. Those who do the work are going to do the work the best way they know how. Even if they value your input and want nothing more than to work with you so that you can show your better way, they are not going to scour the globe to find you. If you don't put the effort in to make yourself known on a regular basis you will be forgotten about. reply postpawl 59 minutes agorootparentAlthough people have a role in forming societal structures, it's not a simple matter of choice when entrenched interests shape the rules. The perception that individuals consent to inequality by focusing on their own lives misses the broader context of systemic barriers. Expecting people to prioritize civic action over making a decent living underestimates the challenges they face. The system needs to facilitate equal participation through reforms in political finance, such as addressing the implications of Citizens United, or revisiting institutional frameworks that may dilute the majority's voice (the Senate). It's about creating conditions where engagement is a realistic option for all, not just those who can afford the time and expense. reply mhitza 1 hour agorootparentprev> But in practice that's a lot of work. In practice there are no built-in mechanics to deal with representatives. Wait X years for reelection is not the option. Liquid Democracy would be a possible solution, in which you have the right to vote on all policy directly, or delegate and revoke your voting rights at any moment to a representative. That would be the only way to deal with representatives that promise one thing in campaigns and do something different once they are in office (aside from the many other benefits it would bring). reply randomdata 1 hour agorootparent> In practice there are no built-in mechanics to deal with representatives. There is if the population agrees that the representative is not acting in accordance to wishes of the population: Off with their head – literally. What are they going to do about it with no head? In practice, representatives by and large do act in accordance with the wishes of the constituency to the best of their ability. The larger problem they face is a constituency that doesn't want to be involved. I expect at least 95% of the population have never even spoken to their representative even just once. But the representatives are only human. They do not possess mind reading abilities, so they can only go on what the tiny fraction of the population who are active submit. But, of course, the tiny fraction of the population who are active are probably not representative of the entire population as a whole, and so you get large disconnects even when the representatives are acting in good faith. reply kevingadd 7 hours agoparentprevThe main problem with direct democracy as performed in the US is that it's trivial to manipulate with sufficiently large ad campaigns, because the average voter is not super well informed on most topics and is usually not motivated to dig deeply when i.e. a ride-sharing company spends a cool hundred million to get the legal outcome they want. This is not to say that the alternative is immune to these problems, but as a former long time california resident direct democracy was directly responsible for many of the state's problems, i.e. prop 13.

By banning the device, we will be doing a disservice to our country’s practitioners in these fields, while doing little to thwart car thefts.

I like how concisely you hit the points. And also that you can note you're a constituent, tech business owner, and tech expert. If different people want to mix up approaches, and hit various notes, to see what resonates, a couple thoughts (as a tech nerd, not a political communicator): * \"Information security research\" has different connotations for different people. No matter how professionally you conduct yourself and respect the term, and no matter how much you promote the term positively as professional... if a particular reader considers the term to be a euphemism for behavior they think should be curtailed, and they think that's the only use of FZ, that might hurt your effort. (Unless you can find a way to promote both at the same time, to those readers, without compromising on either more than you want to.) * All the hobbyist experimenting and building things, by kids and adults alike, I consider constructionist \"education\", which is valued. And I suspect it doesn't hurt to say \"STEM\", as a keyword for the kinds of jobs and economic development this leads to. (Imagine kids figuring out how modern devices work, which today requires more than just unscrewing an appliance and finding the motor and gears. Or getting interested in the RF that backs much of our global technology infrastructure, and inspired to pursue engineering or science. Or using that knowledge to build things that help get them into universities, or that become a tech startup company.) reply kstenerud 5 hours agorootparentprevYou may want to add that the average person's phone is many times more powerful and capable than a flipper.

A lot of vehicles - my wife’s 2015 Kia included - have a very flawed implementation of rolling key encryption. Basically, you need to capture three consecutive keys. The receiver is programmed to allow any future key (in case the fob was pressed away from the car), and will happily reset to past keys when you send three consecutive keys in sequence. Ostensibly this is to avoid people’s fobs from becoming “unpaired” somehow if the car receives a future key. You just hit the button a few times and it works.

An example: Contactless payments, I can pay up to €50 by just pressing my bank card against the receiver. Very convenient, but, anyone can hold a receiver up to where I have my card and steal money that way. There's insurances of course, in this case the bank is pretty clear in saying \"we know this is a risk and you will be compensated\", same as with their apps etc. But it is a tradeoff. reply tamimio 4 hours agoparentprev> How can you use a Flipper Zero to steal a car?

This isn’t in the right radio bands to interfere with anything to do with the safe operation of a plane and it’s using off the shelf radio chips and firmware that would have the appropriate channel switching when they detect a sensitive communication (no different from the stuff the WiFi chip in your laptop and phone are doing when connected to the plane’s WiFi). People were rightly concerned (even if overly conservative and in practice it would be ok) about 3g + planes but since 4g it’s been a solved problem and WiFi has been doing coex with radar channels for forever and if if I recall correctly Bluetooth is too low power to really cause a problem. And to reiterate, flipper zero afaik is using the same off the shelf radio hardware and firmware that would be found in any other product so it wouldn’t be any more dangerous to plane functioning than those products.

This is a mildly powerful toy that has a large, intelligent and curious community around it. The reality is RF stuff is wildly under-explored right now outside of military spaces. On the consumer side I'd guess we're somewhere around the early 2000s internet in terms of security posture.

Starting to feel like a fool for sticking around. reply brailsafe 7 hours agoparentIt's an obnoxiously tough time and it's easy to fall into a pit of despair regarding the decreasing availability of a prosperous future if you don't already have it, and all of those issues can be both interesting and depressing to think about. However, what we do have is a pretty welcoming, friendly, and adventurous population that's a great basis for building a home, even if that doesn't mean having a house. If you have no sentimental attachments, no social life, no outdoor hobbies, no family, no job, and no prospects for a job, all of those together are perfectly legitimate reasons for getting the hell out and seeking prosperity where it might actually be found. For me, I haven't had a job for almost a year, nobody's hiring, nobody will be hiring, rent is increasing, I'll almost certainly never own a home or be able to retire, and I don't think having kids would be feasible if I was set on it; all together, a miserable situation to be in. But... I do have friends, I have places to spend my time, I don't need to worry about medical expenses, I have a roof (for now), and I'm in better shape than many people in their early thirties. I like the vibe, and don't think I'd have better opportunities in those respects anywhere else. That said, I did already move for work once, and picked the most appealing place imo, so anywhere else would have to pass a very high bar in order to compete. I'm also relatively more outgoing and open than people who claim to want strong social lives, and am willing to put in the groundwork. If you're a lonely, socially anxious or inept person, or a sweaty careerist tryhard who doesn't take time away from work anyway, being here vs anywhere else probably won't be such a significant difference except a better account balance. Edit: I'd qualify my characterization of being welcoming, open, and adventurous, with the possible exception of smaller towns and cities where quite the opposite can be true. No so much because they don't like newcomers or because they're bigoted, but many people in those places—even if they're relatively cosmopolitan—haven't bothered to look beyond their high school friends for connection, even well into adulthood, and I've heard that can be quite difficult to break into.

If you've never lived there long-term of course it won't feel like home.

The US has its issues too, but greater state independence and a stronger constitution help. reply brailsafe 5 hours agorootparentI certainly wouldn't suggest such a move would be broadly regrettable, but don't agree with the implication that I'm making excuses. Many people are attracted to the subtle cultural, political, and financial differences the U.S provides, some aren't, and that's ok. The countries and people are more similar than they are different. The problems Canada is currently facing though is partially to do with stagnant cultural values (that are also more similar to the U.S than different) and deeply flawed policy at multiple levels of governance both current and historical, and Trudeau but he's just the latest. A nation is more than it's current set of politicians though—obviously also true of the U.S—and to leave for more money would mean I'd be dismissing the factors that exist despite the bureaucracy. It just depends what your personal circumstances are whether that's a reasonable deal or not, and it's not for me to judge one way or another. If I could make U.S software money from Canada, it's a no-brainer, I just can't and wouldn't really want to live there long-term. The outcome I could hypothetically have doesn't seem all that compelling, but it probably does for a great number of people for obvious reasons. For me though, there's something a bit too intensely capitalist I guess that rubs me the wrong way.

Queensland (then low population), Tasmania, and Territories (low population) did not. Once regulation was uniform and gun licencing was taken seriously there were a lot of guns that people didn't want to licence (\"we have the three we mainly use and another three out the back that grandad used in the war\") - so there was a federally funded buy back scheme \"cash for guns\" to encourage handing in unlicenced weapons for cash, this resulted in pictures of skip bins full of \"confiscated guns\".

Hint: your mini 14, my g3, and my buddy's SKS all fell under this rule, despite having some distinct aesthetics (and all being pretty distinct from the dreaded AR15). reply dghlsakjg 7 hours agorootparentOne thing that all the guns you listed have in common is that they are all battle rifles or derived from battle rifles (very tenuously the M14 in the case of the mini 14). In other words they were designed to be given to young men in the military to shoot at other people. I don't particularly like the new gun rules, but I think that gun advocates do themselves a disfavour when they pretend that an SKS or G3 wasn't designed first and foremost as a military weapon.

I'll bite - what are these relevant material differences? You seem to think that \"designed\" is important but is that a material difference by itself? If so, how does that work? Is that true for anything else? (There's a lot of cross-over between other outdoor equipment, such as vehicle drive systems, clothing, and shelter, so ....) If it's that the intent results in other differences, what are they? It's not the ammunition. It's not how the gun functions. (Yes, the SKS is supposed to be more tolerant of rough handling than most guns, but the AR-15 is less tolerant.) Surely it's not appearance.... Yes, people tend to shoot back, but what material difference in gun design/function is a consequence of that? You contrasted deer hunting with shooting people, but how are they appreciably different at the same distance? (The obvious difference, that the military prefers wounds to deaths, works against your conclusion.) .223, which is what the AR-15 shoots, isn't legal for deer hunting in some jurisdictions because it isn't powerful enough. 7.62x39, which is what the SKS shoots, usually is legal for deer, because it is roughly equivalent to the ancient 30-30. However, typical deer rifles are significantly more powerful. (Of course, people do hunt things other than deer.) You seem to think that a bayonet is important, but are bayonetings a problem? If not, what material difference does a bayonet make? Does that difference persist after the bayonet is removed? If so, how? (I ask because the first thing that most people do with an SKS is to remove the bayonet.) reply defrost 2 hours agorootparent> If not, what material difference does a bayonet make?

Memories of events that happen in the environment we're currently in are easier to access compared to those from different places.[9] As a result, when we experience spatial changes and move to a different location, it can act as a boundary marker that separates and categorizes our continuous flow of memories into distinct segments. Studies[edit] Research on the doorway effect involves having people navigate virtual environments while picking up and putting down various objects. During these experiments, participants were given the names of these objects either (1) as they moved across a large room or (2) when they entered a new room (a spatial change). They then had to indicate whether the named object matched the one they had carried and eventually placed down. Findings indicating doorways act as event boundaries contribute towards wider understanding of memory construction and retention. They indicate the significance of structures of the surrounding environment in how memories are objectively recalled, alongside how it is subjectively recalled: the valence of emotions, specific emotion felt, its intensity and duration.[10][11] In 2006, Gabriel A. Radvansky and David E. Copeland[12] performed the first experiments that demonstrated that successful recall of objects became less accessible with a spatial shift and dissociation from the person. This was measured by the moving of associated or dissociated objects through virtual rooms.[12] Radvansky and Copeland had participants engage with short narratives where objects were either associated or dissociated from the participant. For example, a person might wear a sweatshirt (associated), take it off (dissociated), and go for a run. The researchers measured explicit factors like memory probes and comprehension, as well as implicit factors like reading times. The results showed that information about an object became less available when it was dissociated from the person, compared to when it was associated. These patterns aligned with previous research demonstrating how spatial shifts disrupt cognitive processing. However, it remained unclear to what extent the observed spatial effect was due to the association/dissociation of objects with the participant or the actual spatial change. Hence, Radvansky and Copeland aimed to separate and study these two components independently. To achieve this, they introduced rooms of varying sizes that virtually eliminated walls and doorways while maintaining consistent distance. This allowed them to assess the individual impacts of object association/dissociation and spatial shifts. Their conclusion was twofold: the effect related to object association/dissociation persisted, and there was clear evidence that moving through a doorway made highly available information less accessible. Experiment 1 aimed to investigate if information availability about objects changed based on their association/dissociation with a person after spatial shifts. The Standard Associated/Dissociated Effect refers to the impact of relationships between objects and individuals within a dynamic situation in text comprehension. In simpler terms, how people react or feel when reading a story changes based on the relationships and changes over time. The researchers wanted to see if the patterns seen in text comprehension studies would apply in a virtual reality context, as predicted by situation model theory. Alternatively, traditional memory models might predict that spatial changes wouldn't affect memory. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that after spatial shifts, participants responded more accurately and quickly when objects remained associated with a person rather than being dissociated. This indicated that people actively monitor the spatial and relational aspects of a situation, affecting how information is stored in memory. This finding challenged memory theories that ignored environmental interactions. Even explicit rehearsal of object names experienced disruption. Thus, memory involves active interaction with context. While the effect was clear, it was uncertain what caused it—whether participants monitored what they carried or the spatial shift itself. Participants: They got 41 people (15 were female) from the University of Notre Dame. They got some extra participants, but had to remove data from 10 of them for different reasons. Materials and Setup: They used a program to create a virtual environment with 66 rooms. All the rooms were the same size, and each had a table with an object to pick up. There was also an empty spot on the table where the object from the previous room was supposed to be placed. The rooms had different wall patterns to show they were different. The doors in each room were never on the same wall. Objects: The objects were made by mixing colors and shapes. Colors included red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, gray, brown, and black. Shapes were cube, wedge, pole, disk, cross (X), and cone. Display: They used a large screen and a computer to show everything. Procedure: Participants sat in front of the big screen and were told to move objects from room to room. When they picked up an object, it disappeared, and when they placed it down, it reappeared on the table. The order they did these actions didn't matter. The doors to the next rooms only opened when they did both actions with the objects. Memory Probe Trials: There were 51 trials where they checked participants' memory. When they entered a room, a color and shape name showed up on the screen. They had to say \"yes\" if it matched the object they were carrying or the one they just put down. If it didn't match, they said \"no.\" They used mouse buttons for \"yes\" and \"no\" and arrow keys to move in the virtual space. Some trials tested the associated object, some tested the dissociated object, and some were not related at all. The experiment took about 10 to 15 minutes. Experiment 2 aimed to understand the contribution of object association/dissociation and spatial changes in the effect observed in Experiment 1. The researchers introduced rooms of different sizes, virtually eliminating walls and doorways to maintain consistent distance. This allowed them to analyze the independent impact of these factors. Participants: They got 54 people (26 were women) from the University of Notre Dame to take part. They had to exclude data from 11 participants for different reasons. Materials and Procedure: They used the same tools and methods as in Experiment 1 to create virtual environments. They made two types of rooms - some were big, and some were small. Essentially, they removed walls and doorways to change how the rooms looked, but the distance traveled remained the same. This change affected whether there was a change in the space. No-Shift Trials: In these trials, when someone entered a large room, part of it was darkened, and there was an invisible barrier to stop them from going to the wrong part of the room with the wrong table. The barrier disappeared after they put the object on the correct table and picked up the next one. A memory question came up when they entered the second half of the room. Shift Trials: In these trials, they made a space change. But not every time there was a change did they ask a memory question. Results: Experiment 2 found that the effect they saw in Experiment 1, where the connection between objects and a person affected memory, was seen again. This effect persisted even when there was no space change. Additionally, making a space change had its own effect. Passing through a doorway made information that's usually easy to remember harder to access. However, less important information was less affected. This shows that different things, like how things are connected and the space context, impact how people understand situations. Overall, this research provides insights into how memory is influenced by our interactions with our environment. It demonstrates that the doorway effect disrupts memory due to the need to update our mental representation when transitioning to a new room. This updating process demands cognitive effort and coordination, affecting processing and leading to errors. While more research is needed, this study sheds light on the interplay between physical experiences and mental understanding. 2011, Gabriel A. Radvansky, Sabine A. Krawietz, and Andrea K. Tamplin from the Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame[1] Experiment 1 aimed to understand how reducing the level of immersion impacts the location-updating effect. If this effect requires high immersion because event updating demands direct experience and structural environment influences, reducing screen size might diminish immersion and the effect. Alternatively, if the effect results from tracking information across events, regardless of immersion, the location-updating effect should still be observable. In this experiment, we used standard 17'' diagonal monitors instead of larger ones (66'') to reduce immersion. Participants: Fifty-five participants (31 female) were recruited from the University of Notre Dame participant pool and received partial course credit for their participation. Materials and Setup: The virtual environment was created using the Valve Hammer program. Standard 17'' diagonal monitors were used for display. The environment had 55 rooms, varying in two sizes with equated travel distance in shift and no-shift conditions. Each room contained one or two rectangular tables with objects to be picked up. Doorways were not on the same wall to prevent repetition. Objects: Objects were combinations of colors and shapes, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, grey, brown, and black. Shapes included cube, wedge, pole, disc, cross (X), and cone. Procedure: Participants were seated about 0.67 meters from the display and instructed to pick up objects, move to the next table by walking across a large room (no shift) or through a doorway (shift), place the object on the table, pick up the next object, and so on. Picking up and placing objects was done by touching the table. Progression through rooms was controlled by closing doors behind participants and opening them after objects were placed on the table. Probe trials involved participants responding \"yes\" if the probe matched the carried or set-down object and \"no\" otherwise. Positive and negative probes were presented in both shift and no-shift conditions. The procedure lasted around 15 to 20 minutes. This experiment investigated the impact of reduced immersion on the location-updating effect, shedding light on whether immersion level affects event updating or if tracking information across events is the primary factor influencing this effect. In summary, even with a less immersive setup, there was still a location-updating effect. Memory performance was worse after a change in location, indicating that updating the mental representation of an event can disrupt memory. However, when looking at the error rate data, the absence of an event updating effect in the response time data is unclear. This outcome cannot be interpreted as reduced forgetfulness since the pattern of error rates remains the same. A plausible explanation is that the smaller display size decreased the portion of the visual angle (248 vs. 808) that needs active monitoring, resulting in overall faster response times (358 ms faster on average in this study) and potentially masking the observation of a response time difference. Experiment 2 aimed to determine if the location-updating effect could be observed in a real environment with maximal immersion compared to mediated experiences on a computer screen. Real experiences are considered nonmediated, while virtual environments might lack cues that real settings offer for accurate performance. Previous evidence suggests that virtual environments can lead to cognitive deficits tied to their impoverished nature relative to real environments. The study speculated that the scarcity of spatial cues in virtual environments might explain why location shifts are more disruptive. However, according to an event cognition perspective, the need to monitor and update an event model should apply to real situations as well. To adapt the experiment's principles to real-world constraints, three larger rooms were used from the laboratory. The study included three location shifts where participants moved between rooms. Within each room, a no-shift condition involved performing a task at one table and then crossing the room to perform the next task. For practicality, half of the participants concluded their last trial by returning to the original room. To ensure sufficient observations, six objects were moved during each trial. This approach allowed the study to explore the location-updating effect within a real-world context while addressing logistical challenges. Sixty participants (28 female) from the University of Notre Dame took part in Experiment 2, earning partial course credit. The study aimed to assess the location-updating effect in a maximally immersive real-world environment, contrasting with virtual settings. Participants navigated a three-room environment, with varying room sizes and movement conditions. Colored blocks were used in trials where participants picked up objects and then completed a recognition test, preceded by a distractor task. Each trial comprised 12 recognition probes, and the procedure lasted around 15 to 20 minutes. Experiment 2 confirmed a location-updating effect in a real-world setting, paralleling findings from virtual environments. Memory decline was evident after spatial shifts compared to simple room crossings, aligning with an event cognition perspective. Updating event models upon location change led to memory costs, causing previously relevant information to become less accessible. In Experiment 3, an alternative explanation for the location-updating effect was explored. This explanation suggested that forgetting might arise due to differences in environmental context during retrieval compared to encoding. Different rooms could serve as distinct contexts, potentially leading to poorer memory retrieval when the context differs. To investigate this, Experiment 3 introduced a return condition, where participants went back to the original location after a spatial shift. Additionally, a double shift condition involved two spatial shifts without returning to the original room. The results aimed to differentiate between an event horizon model and encoding specificity accounts of memory disruption. Forty-eight participants (28 female) from the University of Notre Dame were involved. Virtual environments were displayed on a 66'' diagonal Smartboard, enhancing immersion. The virtual space comprised 88 rooms of varying sizes. Objects were placed on rectangular tables in each room. The procedure included memory probe trials after spatial shifts, with 64 trials in total. The experiment lasted around 15 to 20 minutes. The findings aimed to shed light on whether memory disruption is influenced by the number of rooms traversed or the change in contextual cues during retrieval. In general, the response time data closely mirrored the findings from the analysis of error rates. Notably, the absence of improvement when returning to the original context is a crucial observation. This robustly dismisses the possibility of a context-based explanation for the location-updating effect. In 2016, Kyle A. Pettijohn and Gabriel A. Radvansky[8] from the Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame In 2021, Jessica McFadyen, Christopher Nolan , Ellen Pinocy, David Buteri and Oliver Baumann[2] at Bond University In a 2021 study, researchers at Bond University tried to replicate the doorway effect in four experiments: in both physical rooms and virtual rooms, and both with and without the participants doing a “distractor task” (counting backwards). In one experiment -- in virtual rooms, and with a distractor task -- doorways caused a statistically significant increase in false positives (i.e., false memories), but not false negatives (i.e., forgetting). In the other three experiments, doorways had no effect. The researchers suggested that this was consistent with real life, in which \"we might occasionally forget a single item we had in mind after walking into a new room but, crucially, this usually happens when we have other things on our mind . . . .\"[2] One of the study authors, psychologist Oliver Baumann, speculated that it might be “possible to ‘immunise’ yourself against forgetting. ‘“If we are single-minded in what we want to do, nothing will stop us remembering. But if we have multiple things going on, forgetfulness becomes noticeable.’”[13] Real-world effects[edit] Separate studies on the presence of a doorway effect elicited incongruences with typical rhythms of life. Some suggest it may be reasonable to expect that humans should instead be rather facile with dealing with movement from one location to another, and its effects on memory recall – especially with objects one was recently carrying. It has been separately proposed that the doorway effect might be attributed to self-preservation behaviours, evoking alertness towards the lurking of predators on the edge of openings when crossing such thresholds. Hence, guiding one's attention from an internal to external perspective.[9] Implications extend to realms of verbal learning and comprehension, whereby the presence of the effect even on small, short-term memory loads, demonstrates the importance of one's environment on subsequent performance especially for more complex tasks (recalling exam material, interpersonal details, human engagement etc.). Implications of physical environment with memory extend its role in eliciting revealed behaviours including notions of cognitive empathy gaps, which are underlined by deviations in mentalising processes of one's emotive states.[14] Examples of how broader contributions to the relations between environment, memory, and behaviour were demonstrated by London-based behavioural consultancy, Cowry Consulting's \"Preventing falls with pink walls\" project that aimed to reduce unsafe behaviour at construction sites. Changes to the physical environment were made by painting break room walls Baker-Miller pink, restructuring with plants, softer lighting, and communal tables to differentially segment the space were seen \"to reduce anxiety, stress and aggression\".[15] Alternative theories[edit] This section is empty.

No, not the sexy kind, but a foul creature with bony limbs and ashen skin? The kind that snarls as you enter, like a beast about to pounce? The kind that roots you to the spot with its sunken, hypnotic eyes, rendering you unable to flee as you watch the hideous thing uncoil from the shadows? Has your heart started racing though your legs refuse to? Have you felt time slow as the creature crosses the room in the darkness of a blink? Have you shuddered with fear when it places one clawed hand atop your head and another under your chin so it can tilt you, exposing your neck? Have you squirmed as its rough, dry tongue slides down your cheek, over your jaw, to your throat, in a slithering search that's seeking your artery? Have you felt its hot breath release in a hiss against your skin when it probes your pulse—the flow that leads to your brain? Has its tongue rested there, throbbing slightly as if savoring the moment? Have you then experienced a sinking, sucking blackness as you discover that not all vampires feed on blood—some feed on memories? Well, have you? Maybe not.

Things can go wrong in one or two studies, so having independent replication is needed to really cement things. reply tshaddox 11 hours agorootparent> Meaning that the effect must be fairly strong to be observable in two studies with n=50? Do what now? Isn't the problem that it could have randomly happened (especially if people did a bunch of other similar studies that didn't observe an effect, and only these two were published)? reply epistasis 10 hours agorootparentFor a publishable effect at smaller n, the effect size needs to be fairly large. If you have a huge number of people in a trial, you can get statistical significance of negligible consequence. The problem with a single study of n=50 isn't the 50, it's that it's a single study. reply wins32767 6 hours agoparentprevAnd all but one of the studies are by the same lead author. reply xpe 11 hours agoprevHow is the theory falsifiable? What if I pass between two rooms that look identical? Has this been studied?

There's a study listed on that page which observed that re-entering the same room did not improve recall. reply shermantanktop 10 hours agoparentprevThat's psychology and cognitive science.

She would come to a complete halt in the doorways. Then when my dog got old and doolaly he started to do it. Not just humans reply kerkeslager 10 hours agoprevAs someone with ADHD which was unmedicated far beyond what was reasonable, passing through a doorway still has some mild but primordial terror, as I remember a time when walking through a door was like being awoken from unconsciousness in an unfamiliar day. reply newzisforsukas 4 hours agoprevYou can really notice this when under the influence of salvia divinorum. reply bmmayer1 12 hours agoprevOpening a new browser tab and forgetting what I was going to do in that tab is a very frequent phenomenon for me. reply csours 11 hours agoparentI have a pad of honest to g-d paper next to my keyboard for this exact reason.

Patient care supplies (IV bags, IV sets, catheters, dressing supplies) are usually in a side room called the supply room. Ours was in a room behind a doorframe without a door. If I was getting dressing supplies in a state of flow/on auto-pilot, more often than not, I would blank as soon as I went through that doorway and would have to actively think exactly what the hell I was there for. reply jkrubin 6 hours agoprevI had a relevant comment while reading through the Wikipedia article, but I forgot it as soon as I opened up the comments. reply xpe 11 hours agoprev [–] Many psychological studies sound convincing but are hard to replicate and/or based on low sample sizes or poor experimental design.
