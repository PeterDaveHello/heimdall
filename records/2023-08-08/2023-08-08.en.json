However, the garbage books remain available for sale at Amazon with my name attached. I did file a report with Amazon, complaining that these books were using my name and reputation without my consent. Amazon’s response: “Please provide us with any trademark registration numbers that relate to your claim.” When I replied that I did not have a trademark for my name, they closed the case and said the books would not be removed from sale. There’s not much that makes me angry these days about writing and publishing. I’ve seen it all. I know what to expect from Amazon and Goodreads. Meaning: I don’t expect much, and I assume I will be continually disappointed. Nor do I have the power to change how they operate. My energy-saving strategy: move on and focus on what you can control. That’s going to become much harder to do if Amazon and Goodreads don’t start defending against the absolute garbage now being spread across their sites. I know my work gets pirated and frankly I don’t care. (I’m not saying other authors shouldn’t care, but that’s not a battle worth my time today.) But here’s what does rankle me: garbage books getting uploaded to Amazon where my name is credited as the author. (Here’s but one example.) Whoever’s doing this is obviously preying on writers who trust my name and think I’ve actually written these books. I have not. Most likely they’ve been generated by AI. It might be possible to ignore this nonsense on some level since these books aren’t receiving customer reviews (so far), and mostly they sink to the bottom of search results (although not always). At the very least, if you look at my author profile on Amazon, these junk books don’t appear. A reader who applies some critical thinking might think twice before accepting these books as mine. Still, it’s not great. And it falls on me, the author—the one with a reputation at stake—to get these misleading books removed from Amazon. I’m not even sure it’s possible. I don’t own the copyright to these junk books. I don’t exactly “own” my name either—lots of other people who are also legit authors share my name, after all. So on what grounds can I successfully demand this stop, at least in Amazon’s eyes? I’m not sure. To add insult to injury, these sham books are getting added to my official Goodreads profile. A reasonable person might think I control what books are shown on my Goodreads profile, or that I approve them, or at the very least I could have them easily removed. Not so. If you need to have your Goodreads profile corrected—as far as the books credited to you—you have to reach out to volunteer “librarians” on Goodreads, which requires joining a group, then posting in a comment thread that you want illegitimate books removed from your profile. When I complained about this on Twitter/X, an author responded that she had to report 29 illegitimate books in just the last week alone. 29! With the flood of AI content now published at Amazon, sometimes attributed to authors in a misleading or fraudulent manner, how can anyone reasonably expect working authors to spend every week for the rest of their lives policing this? And if authors don’t police it, they will certainly hear about it, from readers concerned about these garbage books, and from readers who credulously bought this crap and have complaints. Or authors might not hear any thing at all, and lose a potential reader forever. We desperately need guardrails on this landslide of misattribution and misinformation. Amazon and Goodreads, I beg you to create a way to verify authorship, or for authors to easily block fraudulent books credited to them. Do it now, do it quickly. Unfortunately, even if and when you get these insane books removed from your official profiles, they will still be floating around out there, with your name, on two major sites that gets millions of visitors, just waiting to be “discovered.” And there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.

The entire internet will just be a computer that guesses what you want and shows you its best guess as the truth. a little matrix-y.Reading back I sound like T*d K but the next 100 years is going to be unimaginable in terms of what silicon is going to be able to do. It doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, just good enough most of the time. Like a mcdonalds drive thru. reply opportune 8 hours agoparentYeah, until someone creates a website that just ships the products they say they have, and people type in the URL for the site directly and shop there?If online shopping were truly such a terribly scammy UX in 100% of cases people would stop using it or shift to shopping from trusted sellers who recognize the tremendous amount of value they can capture by not scamming people. reply mrweasel 2 hours agorootparent> If online shopping were truly such a terribly scammy UX in 100% of cases people would stop using it or shift to shopping from trusted sellersThat slide has already started. I can&#x27;t buy stuff on Amazon anymore, because I don&#x27;t trust the quality or that I&#x27;m not scammed. Unless I trust the author I&#x27;d question buying self published books. There&#x27;s a number of Chinese website, like Wish, that I don&#x27;t understand. Why bother shipping an item to a customer if you&#x27;re running a scam? People order dress and get a plastic Christmas tree... Why even bother sending the tree? Why produce shitty products that break after first use, why not just straight up rob people, seem more genuine and with less environmental impact.There are whole categories of products that can not longer be bought online and an even larger category that can only be purchased from trusted companies.The level of scams have reached new heights in the past year and unless we do something to address \"A.I.\" generated content the internet will drown in useless nonsense. reply gnopgnip 54 minutes agorootparentAmazon has been problematic for a while. I think it was 2019 when I remember filtering to sold by amazon.com was a lot harder, but before that there were still problems with tons of low quality products and fake reviewsCostco bucks this trend though reply eloisius 30 minutes agorootparentprev> Yeah, until someone creates a website that just ships the products they say they have, and people type in the URL for the site directly and shop there?This already happens over and over, and with AI it’s only going to be worse. Company makes a decent product, gains reputation, and then strip mines their good will for quick cash while quality plummets. After a while, you just distrust the whole online shopping experience. Even if someone is selling a good product, the lemons are ruining the whole market. reply eloisant 14 minutes agorootparentprevI have already stopped using Amazon for specialized products.I buy board games on sites that only sell board games.I buy electronics&#x2F;computer parts on sites that only sell that. reply labster 8 hours agorootparentprevWe’re in a race to the bottom. There’s no way a company selling legitimate products will be able to compete or grow a customer base in the AI future, because we’ll be swimming in garbage. reply soerxpso 8 hours agorootparentThis assumes that the only ways people have to find companies are search engines and other mediums that are prone to AI takeover. If everyone starts to realize that most of the surface internet is garbage, they would start communicating with humans they know about which places are not garbage. It was possible to find good businesses to interact with before Google existed.Obviously in a world where every online retailer is nearly useless, a guy who creates an online retailer that is not useless would immediately have anyone he personally tells about it as customers, and anyone they tell about it, and so on (since in this hypothetical, everyone is desperate for a good retailer). reply UtopiaPunk 7 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s how people find the good torrent spots, so topical. reply andrei_says_ 7 hours agorootparentprevWe swim in garbage already (looking at amazon) but bhphoto and sweetwater still exist. reply RajT88 7 hours agorootparentNewegg as well. reply Izkata 6 hours agorootparentNewegg is now an amazon-style marketplace, with stuff they sell mixed in to the rest same as how AmazonBasics is mixed in to the rest. reply neilv 7 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;re already getting there.Maybe Amazon brands will at least be predictable, but the non-Amazon brands on Amazon will be increasingly counterfeits and noise.(A contributor to the current problem of eroding non-Amazon brands with counterfeits seems to be Amazon&#x27;s commingling from different marketplace sellers of the \"same ASIN\". And the current mass-spam search DoS of random-name brands and near-identical products from overseas sellers is also a problem. Amazon can not only shield their own brands from both of those problems, but can also exercise more supply chain integrity control for its brands than is possible for the non-Amazon brands if Amazon doesn&#x27;t cooperate.) reply smithza 6 hours agorootparentYet I think Amazon brands are setup to eliminate competition due to their insider information in the market place. I wouldn’t put my money in them because they aren’t playing fairly in the market. reply dragonwriter 6 hours agorootparentprev> Maybe Amazon brands will at least be predictable, but the non-Amazon brands on Amazon will be increasingly counterfeits and noise.Of course, because that helps sell the Amazon brand goods. reply giantg2 7 hours agorootparentprevPlenty of niche, premium, or physical stores out there. People might need to pay a little more for it, but they do exist. Not everyone buys everything from the same super stores. reply UtopiaPunk 7 hours agorootparentWhat are some of your favorites (tech or otherwise)? reply giantg2 5 hours agorootparentSmall local businesses, like homebrew shops. Seed companies like Rare Seeds, Gurney, etc. Mushroom places like The Cultured Mushroom, Liquid Fungi. reply skydhash 6 hours agorootparentprevKeyboardioRoost StandAccessories4lessSvsound reply zebomon 8 hours agorootparentprevI really don&#x27;t see how one follows the other without then in sequence, as the comment you replied to describes, value-based businesses emerge to fill the obvious gap and compete. reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparentpeople still shop at Amazon, so I&#x27;m not too convinced in your argument reply Semaphor 40 minutes agorootparentI have gotten a fake product one time (public domain book, PoD instead of what I wanted and what apparently used to be under that URL) refunded, no questions asked, even got to keep the book (anyone in Germany interested in an HP Lovecraft decent quality hardcover PoD book?).I realize that it’s apparently way worse in the US, but there supposedly are issues here as well, I just never encountered them (or the products are so well-faked that it’s a distinction without a difference).Fast delivery, a lot of choices, both \"Aliexpress but faster delivery for a price\", but also EU products, and a customer service that does pretty much anything asked. reply 2muchcoffeeman 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s the delivery. I can often get something inconsequential for net cheaper, faster from Amazon. Local stock is usually next day. And I can often get stuff internationally cheaper and faster through Amazon than the real retailer.You’d have to duplicate this to take them on. reply dylan604 6 hours agorootparentstep by step that slope gets just a little more slippery, or is it the frog in the pot of boiling water? reply stOneskull 8 hours agorootparentprevthere&#x27;ll still be people and communication. and so, word-of-mouth. reply Fricken 7 hours agorootparentprevThis might be why physical bookstores are making a comeback. Trustworthy curation is essential, and worth paying a premium for. This has always been the case, but maybe not fully appreciated. reply interestica 7 hours agorootparentThis has been why I&#x27;ve started to really like Costco -- they&#x27;re essentially acting as product curators (and back it up with a generous return policy.) reply dangus 6 hours agorootparentWell, I like how local bookstores go about curation more than Costco.I don&#x27;t know if we can say that a store with unlabeled aisles can be a source of curation. reply yonaguska 5 hours agorootparentit&#x27;s curation in that the products they do offer are generally trustworthy. reply kelnos 7 hours agorootparentprevI think that&#x27;s an ok workaround, but I don&#x27;t want to go to physical bookstores, and I don&#x27;t want physical books. As much as I do like the feel of a physical book, I much prefer the convenience and portability of a digital book.And speaking of convenience, it would be a big shame if we had to go back to physical stores for non-trivial purchases because we can&#x27;t trust anything online. reply arnvidr 34 minutes agorootparentMany physical bookstores have web pages where they sell e-books as well. Find the store that serves what you want, instead of finding faults with the ones who don&#x27;t and going with the huge sell-everything-store. reply nomat 3 hours agorootparentprevImagine like an LLM trained on everything you&#x27;ve ever done since birth included as part of the data set. and then one of those for each other person in the world. they could slice and dice you into a thousand different groups.at some point technology is going to stop being something that we interact with through a screen and a keyboard. Google maps will be there, where ever you go, all the time. No more getting lost or wondering where anything is located. You will just know. or at least, be told.Something else to consider is the fallibility of human memory. As we generate more information we&#x27;re gonna have to start abstracting and delegating some of those storage and retrieval tasks to the computer, trusting it completely. Today maybe you can remember things but what about your parents? reply jbergens 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t remember everything I&#x27;ve done or why. There is very little training data to be found for us as persons. IF they hack your phone or computer they might be able to store how you interact with the internet. Which things you browse and read, what you buy, how you write on social media. They could possible then create a digital twin (a clone) of your online presence but it would be a lot of work for very unclear gains. If they hack enough people they could learn some connections like that people interested in electric cars might also be interested in battery technology and solar panels, people who are interested in vegetarian food might also like to read&#x2F;write about vegan food or the environment and so on. But I still think it would be a LOT of work just to end up creating a fake website selling fake batteries or vegetarian food that you either never deliver or that ends up being a poor replica of the good stuff. reply waihtis 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, currently the top LLM fails at repeatedly generating a stable set of pretty simple regexes for me, so where pretty far from a full-blown LLM dystopia at this point. reply sznio 2 hours agorootparentLLMs are too dumb to be useful, but smart enough to be destructive.You don&#x27;t need to be able to generate correct regexes to create a blogspam article about regexes that will go to the top of the search results. reply Peritract 1 hour agorootparent> LLMs are too dumb to be useful, but smart enough to be destructive.I think this puts the blame in the wrong place; LLMs are too dumb to be useful, but it&#x27;s the users who are too dumb to realise that, or too unethical to care. reply uoaei 48 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s also the creators, hosters, and startup founders who are overselling its capabilities. reply Peritract 16 minutes agorootparentI was lumping them in with &#x27;users&#x27;; I don&#x27;t think the evangelists are any less credulous than their marks. reply waihtis 1 hour agorootparentprevsearch is dying anyway and this will just accelerate that trend. reply mavhc 3 hours agorootparentprevThe question is does the rapid progress in LLMs continue over the next few years, or do we reach another local maximum. Is \"currently\" going to improve rapidly? reply waihtis 2 hours agorootparentas I understand we&#x27;re approaching local maximum with LLMs and that is what I base the previous comment on, but fully layman and no insight into deeper layers of LLM R&D reply LapsangGuzzler 8 hours agorootparentprevI think AI is going to make it harder to separate the signal from the noise, though. We’re already seeing this play out with sites like Amazon that are just full of cheap junk that’s blatantly ripped off and undercut in price, or Google as people are complaining about the quality of search results. reply ianburrell 7 hours agorootparentNotice that niche shopping sites don’t have reviews. Bigger sites have reviews but they don’t get gamed. Without affiliates or listing products like Amazon, there is no way for the spammers to make money.I’m surprised that places like Walmart or Target haven’t gotten burned by cross listings. They could drop the program and advertise as alternative to Amazon. If Amazon had “sold by Amazon” filter, it would be a lot more usable. reply pixl97 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy be a billionaire when you can be a trillionare? Greed will ruin everything. reply opportune 7 hours agorootparentIf incumbents are delivering a terrible product because they’re chasing 4 commas I will happily settle for 3 commas to provide a basic “shopping but on the internet” experience people actually want to use. reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparentprevi see your Tres Comas and raise you Quatro Comas reply wpietri 8 hours agoparentprevYeah, my big concern about LLMs is not Skynet or a zillion people out of work. It&#x27;s that the spammers and their ilk are now vastly more capable. The fact that generative LLMs are glib bullshit machines is a problem for most sane uses, but a plus for people who don&#x27;t give two shits about the truth as long as they&#x27;ve got a chance of making some money. reply akira2501 2 hours agorootparentIt reminds me of payola.Radio stations would get paid to make songs that weren&#x27;t popular seem more popular than they were so people would blindly buy them. It&#x27;s the same old snake oil just taken to mass media.Since both behaviors revolve around profit, you can apply the same means to mediate them. Further, the open plan \"user generated content\" model has been dying for a while now, the wills of some well moneyed monopolies keep it alive. We will iterate to something much better anyways. Perhaps this is just a force that drives it. reply hsbauauvhabzb 7 hours agorootparentprevThis, but also in the professional space. My coworkers much be 200% faster now, but I’m going to spend 80% of my time unfucking their work. reply hsbauauvhabzb 7 hours agorootparentBut also good luck next time you google health symptoms - sure it’s bad, but everybody does it, and we’re going to move further and further away from accurate. reply mrweasel 2 hours agorootparentYou can rely on the internet to provide even remotely correct health information anymore. It was always a little questionable, due to all the variables, but you could get some indication on how quickly you should get yourself to the doctor.Same with weight-loss or exercise programs, that&#x27;s basically impossible to search for due to the amount of spam and garbage content. reply throwaway2037 2 hours agorootparentprevRegarding health, stick to Mayo Clinic, US Centers for Disease Control, or other very reputable websites. That one seems easier than buying stuff online. The slow descent is hard to navigate for many people. reply menus 8 hours agoparentprevYou have described Dead Internet Theory:: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dead_Internet_theory reply spicyusername 9 hours agoparentprevI think people have a lower tolerance for this than that, and will just go back to relying on personal recommendations and other reliable forms of curation. reply brianmcc 39 minutes agorootparentYep. Case in point - I&#x27;ve given up buying on Amazon UK and use Argos as my go-to shop instead, for products of far better assured provenance without having to really overthink it all. reply citizenpaul 8 hours agorootparentprevI think we will see the pendulum swing back. Yahoo lost to google because they were a manually curated search engine and could not keep up with google indexing and search. Now that all search is SEO gamed garbagebwe are going to see a new curated search engine rise in market share again reply hedora 8 hours agorootparentThat’s not why Yahoo lost. They switched CEOs and corporate direction &#x2F; business models more than once a year on average toward the end.Also, during the collapse of yahoo, it was a poorly kept secret that google had already mostly abandoned page rank, and had large manual curation teams.To add insult to injury, in unbranded head to head tests, Yahoo search had better search result quality than google for many years before it was sold to Microsoft. reply vbezhenar 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure that Google uses human adjustments for their search results. reply realusername 2 hours agorootparentKnowing how Google is allergic to anything human in their product loop and obsessed with automation at all costs, I doubt they make a difference. reply userbinator 8 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, \"personal recommendations\" seems to mean \"influencers\" these days. reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparentthat&#x27;s the part that I love love love. society has gotten to this ridiculous follower stage that people seem to think it is a personal connection. maybe i&#x27;ve just spent too much time too close to the ad agency world to see how nasty they are, but anytime i see some random person on the internet that i do not personally know recommending anything, i immediately assume they are paid for that \"recommendation\". too much \"inside baseball\" to know that nothing you see in an ad is real even if you don&#x27;t consciously recognize the fact what you are looking at is an ad. reply throwaway2037 2 hours agorootparentHell yes. +9000 for your post. To me, the solution is much transparency around paid product placement through strong regulation.See \"Parasocial interaction\". Parasocial interaction (PSI) refers to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media, particularly on television and on online platforms. Viewers or listeners come to consider media personalities as friends, despite having no or limited interactions with them. PSI is described as an illusory experience, such that media audiences interact with personas (e.g., talk show hosts, celebrities, fictional characters, social media influencers) as if they are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them. The term was coined by Donald Horton and Richard Wohl in 1956.Ref: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parasocial_interaction reply hedora 8 hours agorootparentprevThe streaming services business model more-or-less outlaws collections that are curated by third parties.We already know what happens when piracy is the most convenient&#x2F;highest quality option, but I’m guessing media distributors will need a reminder soon. reply stevage 8 hours agoparentprevI imagine everything constantly hovering on the threshold of what is tolerable enough for most people. If you could never buy anything useful on the internet, the system would collapse and people would do something different. But instead, the quality etc will just decline to a point where it is still marginally better than alternatives like shopping in person etc. reply ghaff 8 hours agorootparentPeople who can afford to do so will perhaps just pay 2x to 3x to shop a more limited selection from personally curated stores. reply shinycode 7 hours agorootparentUnfortunately if you so create a new product or service it’ll be really hard to find you this way and it might require a lot more money and effort to reach out to the audience. reply bbarnett 3 hours agorootparentOooooh, custom search engines.Amazon would hate this, but make a deal with shopify to speed up spidering their sites. Then, spider all other retailors.You put in a product id&#x2F;name, and it only shows results from amazon, shopify sites, and vetted retailers.The manual curation part, is vetting the retail site. Walmart would be a problem(for example), unless it was easy to tag &#x27;sold by walmart&#x27;. Amazon&#x27;s filter would only include shipped by amazon stuff.So like &#x27;hanes t-shirt&#x27;, and you get 7 links, from 7 sites, all woth prices and shipping cost estimates.Amazon has horrible pricing, bordering on predatory for some things. Maybe I&#x27;ll do this, I&#x27;m bored this summer. reply zen_1 6 hours agoparentprevOne of the few sentences more depressing (when relevant) than \"Stallman was right\" is \"Ted Kaczynski had a point\". reply 0xbadcafebee 6 hours agoparentprevYour first paragraph is just Amazon today. They don&#x27;t need AI for people to make up products and send you garbage. They probably will use AI for reviews, but they already have fake reviews that reliably fool people, so this isn&#x27;t much different. If it gets so bad that Amazon&#x27;s bottom line is threatened, they&#x27;ll actually crack down; they&#x27;re assholes, not business-suicidal.\"The entire internet will just be a computer that guesses what you want and shows you its best guess as the truth\" - you just described Google Search, like, 5 years ago.\"the next 100 years is going to be unimaginable..\" - not really. What we&#x27;re capable of is not what happens. We only reach the minimum viable capability that meets a societal expectation. Once the expectation is reached, progress stagnates, until something exceptional changes the expectation. As a more specific example, regardless of how advanced hardware gets, software remains a gas that fills any container, so what we can actually do with the hardware is always limited by our horrible software.People keep talking about AI like it&#x27;s going to transform everything. It&#x27;s actually more like colorized talking movies vs the black-and-white silent ones. Reshapes industries and changes expectations and experiences? For sure. But the films, plots, characters, actors, industry, viewers, their effect on society, etc remain the same. 3D didn&#x27;t take hold, neither did smell-o-vision, drive-ins, and countless other \"innovations\", even though they were feasible. This is just one example, there are tens of thousands of other examples I could give. It&#x27;s like a law of nature. We don&#x27;t accomplish what we aren&#x27;t motivated to.Also, mcdonalds drive thrus work all the time, not just most of the time. The drive thru is the engine that generates most of the revenue; it&#x27;s a conveyor belt for cash. A franchise would go out of business if the drive thru broke. reply nomat 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m talking about the quality of the food here.as for the rest of the post, the application is not limited to consumer products. Imagine the 2016 election season in 2056. or another covid pandemic. reply coliveira 8 hours agoparentprevThis is already happening: whatever you ask Google, they have some crazy AI algorithm running in the back trying to discover what you want to see as result, so as to maximize the profit from your clicks. reply bombcar 8 hours agorootparentOptimistic of you to assume “what you want to see” and “what makes you click most profitably” coincide. reply slabity 8 hours agorootparentConsidering they haven&#x27;t completely removed Pinterest from their platform, I absolutely agree. reply mr_toad 7 hours agoparentprevMaybe people will finally stop believing everything they see online. reply femto 8 hours agoparentprevEven that&#x27;s optimistic. I&#x27;d say \"its best guess as the truth\" should read \"its best guess at what you will accept as the truth\".

It&#x27;s obviously fine for the fake books to be written under the name Jane Friedman. I am not sure how common it is for fictional authors to have fictional biographical information printed on their books, but it seems hard to avoid for something like Naked Came the Stranger that was attributed to a single author without actually having one.And even if we think a fictional biography is beyond the pale, most of the bio here isn&#x27;t fraudulent. Everyone is free to say they are a renowned author and publishing expert regardless of the facts. (\"Puffery.\") There is a factual claim about having two decades of experience in the publishing industry, and a factual claim about having contributed to numerous industry publications.And after all of that, if you thought you could make a case that the bio in the back made the book fraudulent, the injured party would be someone who had purchased the book, not the author being imitated.-----Jane Friedman (the real one) asked Amazon for the wrong remedy. There isn&#x27;t a reason to remove the books from sale, and Amazon was right not to do that.

This is why you seldom see these studies, because the powers that be don&#x27;t want you to know that.A few breakout songs in the early 00s wouldn&#x27;t have even made the top 100 if it weren&#x27;t for limewire (laffy taffy being a prime example) and there were a number of artists at the time who intentionally capitalized on this.So yes in 20 years when I settle down and write a book about the rust community and my wild ride through the startup world, I&#x27;ll probably upload the torrents myself because I know it will boost sales.Just like Adobe was caught doing back in the early 2000s (though if you try to google it now the news articles are mysteriously scrubbed from the internet). That&#x27;s right, there is a good chance at least one of the Photoshop CS4 torrents you downloaded as a wee lad was uploaded by a marketing team at Adobe. They were caught red-handed doing this and it wasn&#x27;t just some rogue employee.And if you think about it, it was absolutely brilliant.

Its what happens when large tech. companies play \"who blinks first\". Apple has a fair share of blame here, with their cut of 30%&#x2F;15% from digital content they did not help to produce.As someone who enjoys reading on my Kindle and as an early Audible customer, the crap in app browsing and purchasing experience was one of the reasons I put off having an iPhone.After years of complaints, now at least in app Audible books browsing and purchasing works on iPhone, sigh ...Now having an iPhone, I have simply traded one set of bad experiences for another, as currently the set of bad experiences on an iPhone, is less important than the on an Android. reply manicennui 7 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure you can&#x27;t buy Kindle books with Amazon&#x27;s iOS apps because Apple wants a cut. reply VincentEvans 7 hours agorootparentAnd yet I can buy entire contents of the amazon using the Amazon shopping app. Or Walmart app. Or Target app. Or Best Buy app.Opening amazon.com via Safari on an iphone is a throwback and a very odd experience - I haven’t needed to use a mobile version of amazon.com in ages - i use the app for all my Amazon shopping.And one other thing - I can’t stand Musk, but given my experience with Amazon in a world where WeChat exists - perhaps Musk has a chance with his X super app plan after all. reply lathiat 6 hours agorootparentThe reason is that Apple specifically requires all digital only purchases to only use in-app payment and must give Apple 30%. You are not allowed to process digital purchases through an app with your own payment system. You also can’t tell people that or link them to the website.This does not apply to physical goods. Which is why all the apps you mentioned are fine.This is the same issue that has been talked about for years, the cause of Epic (Fortnite) vs Apple, etc. reply VincentEvans 6 hours agorootparentHeh, ok. But re-read the above adventure in digital commerce that I have described. Can none of this be made easier if a company gave even a fractional amount of care? Like, for instance - allow searching and requesting a purchase from a child’s Kindle pending an approval action by a parent? That’s just one example I thought of instantaneously - because I used the damn thing. Can none of the, probably thousands, product- and user-experience experts adept in Amazon Principles and commanding six-digit compensations solve this so that I don’t need to post about it on HN? reply lathiat 3 hours agorootparentI agree the Kindle part was silly, and could be much improved. I just wanted to specifically clarify why you started out on the wrong foot with iOS and why the iOS app couldn&#x27;t even tell you about the option existing elsewhere.However once you started on a browser, the rest of your story I would agree with. reply mcphage 5 hours agorootparentprev> The reason is that Apple specifically requires all digital only purchases to only use in-app payment and must give Apple 30%. You are not allowed to process digital purchases through an app with your own payment system. You also can’t tell people that or link them to the website.> This does not apply to physical goods.I don&#x27;t really get this division other than \"it&#x27;s what Apple could get away with\". As far as the payment processing is concerned, it seems like a distinction without a difference. reply lathiat 2 hours agorootparentI have always thought the division is to basically protect Apple&#x27;s cut of the revenue for \"App Sales\". Not, strictly speaking, because they want to take 30% of every possible purchase or service -- though I am sure they would be happy with that and do desire that to some extent. However more and more every year sales of an \"app\" become smaller and smaller and everything is a subscription - so it seems this thought is rapidly if not already outdated.The world we now live in is that all \"apps and programs\" can be either a one-off purchase like a physical good or a subscription. That subscription might be for the \"app\" or it may be packaged as a subscription to a \"service\" that the app is facilitating (the line between the two is very blurry). Additionally, all digital goods like books, music and movies may also be a one-off purchase or a \"subscription\" like audible, apple music, etc.The line between all of those is blurry such that, any set of rules you write leaves it open to convert \"app sales\" to \"services&#x2F;subscriptions\" or even to bundle access to your app or it&#x27;s content as \"digital goods\" to avoid that 30% cut. People would (and do) switch their sales model to then avoid that cut.I don&#x27;t have a solution and I don&#x27;t think Apple or the open webs way is specifically better in every aspect, but I do think it&#x27;s interesting to think about the problem space. reply kccqzy 4 hours agorootparentprevAccording to Apple&#x27;s logic, they are providing more service than just payment processing. reply mavhc 3 hours agorootparentIt would be a shame if your digital goods were accidentally destroyed by my associates, a fee, of perhaps 30%, would ensure this terrible tragedy would be avoided.They provide no service, hopefully soon it will be illegal. reply memefrog 48 minutes agorootparentIllegal to do what? Charge people fees for what they do using your platform? On what possible basis can you make it illegal? It&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s app store for software that runs on Apple&#x27;s phones.

It&#x27;s their prerogative, after all, not Amazon&#x27;s.I mean, really, if your employer told you that the only way they can pay you is if you used their in-house payment system that took 75% of your pre-tax earnings as a commission, you&#x27;d go elsewhere too. reply Rebelgecko 4 hours agorootparentprevPresumably that&#x27;s because if you&#x27;re buying groceries or whatever it doesn&#x27;t compete with Apple.

    "originBody": "Julia Evans ABOUT TALKS PROJECTS TWITTER MASTODON GITHUB FAVORITES ZINES RSS Some tactics for writing in public Someone recently asked me – “how do you deal with writing in public? People on the internet are such assholes!” I’ve often heard the advice “don’t read the comments”, but actually I’ve learned a huge amount from reading internet comments on my posts from strangers over the years, even if sometimes people are jerks. So I want to explain some tactics I use to try to make the comments on my posts more informative and useful to me, and to try to minimize the number of annoying comments I get. talk about facts On here I mostly talk about facts – either facts about computers, or stories about my experiences using computers. For example this post about tcpdump contains some basic facts about how to use tcpdump, as well as an example of how I’ve used it in the past. Talking about facts means I get a lot of fact-based comments like: people sharing their own similar (or different) experiences (“I use tcpdump a lot to look at our RTP sequence numbers”) pointers to other resources (“the documentation from F5 about tcpdump is great”) other interesting related facts I didn’t mention (“you can use tcpdump -X too”, “netsh on windows is great”, “you can use sudo tcpdump -s 0 -A 'tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420' to filter for HTTP GET requests) potential problems or gotchas (“be careful about running tcpdump as root, try just setting the required capabilities instead”) questions (“Is there a way to place the BPF filter after IP packet reassembly?” or “what’s the advantage of tcpdump over wireshark?”) mistakes I made In general, I’d say that people’s comments about facts tend to stay pretty normal. The main kinds of negative comments I get about facts are: occasionally people get a little rude about facts I didn’t mention (“Didn’t use -n in any of the examples…please…“). I think I didn’t mention -n in that post because at the time I didn’t know why the -n flag was useful (it’s useful because it turns off this annoying reverse DNS lookup that tcpdump does by default so you can see the IP addresses). people are also sometimes weird about mistakes. I mostly try to head this off by trying to be self-aware about my knowledge level on a topic, and saying “I’m not sure…” when I’m not sure about something. stories are great I think stories encourage pretty good discussion. For example, why you should understand (a little) about TCP is a story about a time it was important for me to understand how TCP worked. When I share stories about problems I solved, the comments really help me understand how what I learned fits into a bigger context. For example: is this a common problem? people will often comment saying “this happened to me too!” what are other common related problems that come up? are there other possible solutions I didn’t consider? Also I think these kinds of stories are incredibly important – that post describes a bug that was VERY hard for me to solve, and the only reason I was able to figure it out in the first place was that I read this blog post. ask technical questions Often in my blog posts I ask technical questions that I don’t know the answer to (or just mention “I don’t know X…”). This helps people focus their replies a little bit – an obvious comment to make is to provide an answer to the question, or explain the thing I didn’t know! This is fun because it feels like a guaranteed way to get value out of people’s comments – people LOVE answering questions, and so they get to look smart, and I get the answer to a question I have! Everyone wins! fix mistakes I make a lot of mistakes in my blog posts, because I write about a lot of things that are on the edge of my knowledge. When people point out mistakes, I often edit the blog post to fix it. Usually I’ll stay near a computer for a few hours after I post a blog post so that I can fix mistakes quickly as they come up. Some people are very careful to list every single error they made in their blog posts (“errata: the post previously said X which was wrong, I have corrected it to say Y”). Personally I make mistakes constantly and I don’t have time for that so I just edit the post to fix the mistakes. ask for examples/experiences, not opinions A lot of the time when I post a blog post, people on Twitter/Mastodon will reply with various opinions they have about the thing. For example, someone recently replied to a blog post about DNS saying that they love using zone files and dislike web interfaces for managing DNS records. That’s not an opinion I share, so I asked them why. They explained that there are some DNS record types (specifically TLSA) that they find often aren’t supported in web interfaces. I didn’t know that people used TLSA records, so I learned something! Cool! I’ve found that asking people to share their experiences (“I wanted to use X DNS record type and I couldn’t”) instead of their opinions (“DNS web admin interfaces are bad”) leads to a lot of useful information and discussion. I’ve learned a lot from it over the years, and written a lot of tweets like “which DNS record types have you needed?” to try to extract more information about people’s experiences. I try to model the same behaviour in my own work when I can – if I have an opinion, I’ll try to explain the experiences I’ve had with computers that caused me to have that opinion. start with a little context I think internet strangers are more likely to reply in a weird way when they have no idea who you are or why you’re writing this thing. It’s easy to make incorrect assumptions! So often I’ll mention a little context about why I’m writing this particular blog post. For example: A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest frustrations with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software. or I’ve started to run a few more servers recently (nginx playground, mess with dns, dns lookup), so I’ve been thinking about monitoring. or Last night, I needed to scan some documents for some bureaucratic reasons. I’d never used a scanner on Linux before and I was worried it would take hours to figure out… avoid causing boring conversations There are some kinds of programming conversations that I find extremely boring (like “should people learn vim?” or “is functional programming better than imperative programming?“). So I generally try to avoid writing blog posts that I think will result in a conversation/comment thread that I find annoying or boring. For example, I wouldn’t write about my opinions about functional programming: I don’t really have anything interesting to say about it and I think it would lead to a conversation that I’m not interested in having. I don’t always succeed at this of course (it’s impossible to predict what people are going to want to comment about!), but I try to avoid the most obvious flamebait triggers I’ve seen in the past. There are a bunch of “flamebait” triggers that can set people off on a conversation that I find boring: cryptocurrency, tailwind, DNSSEC/DoH, etc. So I have a weird catalog in my head of things not to mention if I don’t want to start the same discussion about that thing for the 50th time. Of course, if you think that conversations about functional programming are interesting, you should write about functional programming and start the conversations you want to have! Also, it’s often possible to start an interesting conversation about a topic where the conversation is normally boring. For example I often see the same talking points about IPv6 vs IPv4 over and over again, but I remember the comments on Reasons for servers to support IPv6 being pretty interesting. In general if I really care about a topic I’ll talk about it anyway, but I don’t care about functional programming very much so I don’t see the point of bringing it up. preempt common suggestions Another kind of “boring conversation” I try to avoid is suggestions of things I have already considered. Like when someone says “you should do X” but I already know I could have done X and chose not to because of A B C. So I often will add a short note like “I decided not to do X because of A B C” or “you can also do X” or “normally I would do X, here I didn’t because…”. For example, in this post about nix, I list a bunch of Nix features I’m choosing not to use (nix-shell, nix flakes, home manager) to avoid a bunch of helpful people telling me that I should use flakes. Listing the things I’m not doing is also helpful to readers – maybe someone new to nix will discover nix flakes through that post and decide to use them! Or maybe someone will learn that there are exceptions to when a certain “best practice” is appropriate. set some boundaries Recently on Mastodon I complained about some gross terminology that I’d just noticed in the dig man page on my machine. A few dudes in the replies (who by now have all deleted their posts) asked me to prove that the original author intended it to be offensive (which of course is besides the point, there’s just no need to have a term widely understood to be referring to sexual assault in the dig man page) or tried to explain to me why it actually wasn’t a problem. So I blocked a few people and wrote a quick post: man so many dudes in the replies demanding that i prove that the person who named dig “domain information groper” intended it in an offensive way. Big day for the block button I guess :) I don’t do this too often, but I think it’s very important on social media to occasionally set some rules about what kind of behaviour I won’t tolerate. My goal here is usually to drive away some of the assholes (they can unfollow me!) and try to create a more healthy space for everyone else to have a conversation about computers in. Obviously this only works in situations (like Twitter/Mastodon) where I have the ability to garden my following a little bit over time – I can’t do this on HN or Reddit or Lobsters or whatever and wouldn’t try. As for fixing it – the dig maintainers removed the problem language years ago, but Mac OS still has a very outdated version for license reasons. (you might notice that this section is breaking the “avoid boring conversations” rule above, this section was certain to start a very boring argument, but I felt it was important to talk about boundaries so I left it in) don’t argue Sometimes people seem to want to get into arguments or make dismissive comments. I don’t reply to them, even if they’re wrong. I dislike arguing on the internet and I’m extremely bad at it, so it’s not a good use of my time. analyze negative comments If I get a lot of negative comments that I didn’t expect, I try to see if I can get something useful out of it. For example, I wrote a toy DNS resolver once and some of the commenters were upset that I didn’t handle parsing the DNS packet. At the time I thought this was silly (I thought DNS parsing was really straightforward and that it was obvious how to do it, who cares that I didn’t handle it?) but I realized that maybe the commenters didn’t think it was easy or obvious, and wanted to know how to do it. Which makes sense! It’s not obvious at all if you haven’t done it before! Those comments partly inspired implement DNS in a weekend, which focuses much more heavily on the parsing aspects, and which I think is a much better explanation how to write a DNS resolver. So ultimately those comments helped me a lot, even if I found them annoying at the time. (I realize this section makes me sound like a Perfectly Logical Person who does not get upset by negative public criticism, I promise this is not at all the case and I have 100000 feelings about everything that happens on the internet and get upset all the time. But I find that analyzing the criticism and trying to take away something useful from it helps a bit) that’s all! Thanks to Shae, Aditya, Brian, and Kamal for reading a draft of this.

Software folks are used to the past where you could master things completely. With the continued growth of knowledge and the growth of the worlds complexity, it is quite impossible even for one super intelligent person that was present at the dawn of creation to keep up; failing to consider disagreement as a potentially useful pointer to the situation where you don&#x27;t have as much knowledge as you think is a risk. (edited to add \"is a risk\" so that was a sentence.)I have seen multiple projects led by extremely smart people fail because they didn&#x27;t listen to key information from less smart people that were nonetheless better informed about the particular technologies involved. reply grog454 14 hours agoparentSomeone who thinks they know more than they do is a lot more dangerous than someone who doesn&#x27;t know much but realizes it. reply BurningFrog 7 hours agoparentprevThese people may have decent raw intelligence, but they&#x27;re NOT smart!Actually smart people know what they know and don&#x27;t know, constantly test their understanding, and are HAPPY when proven wrong, since that means they learned something new. reply gremlinunderway 13 hours agoparentprevYeah, there&#x27;s a really odd all or nothing kind of attitude with knowledge, experience or skill, as if \"being smart\" is like a linear growth Pokemon level-thing rather than being more like a radar chart of skills and experience.Which I find so odd and absurd in a profession that&#x27;s full of esoteric knowledge. Being experienced and smart obviously is a huge asset, but if you just aren&#x27;t familiar with library X but new guy with no experience has been doing nothing but library X, the latter guy is the one to take advice from. reply munificent 12 hours agorootparentSoftware development strongly self-selects for people who like black-and-white, all-or-nothing, binary reasoning.Few people have patience for a tool that will fail to even attempt to run a several-million-line program because there happens to be a trivial typo in one line in one file. It should be no surprise that kind of people for whom behavior like that is reasonable are the kind of people to think intelligence is all-or-nothing, and that are too happy to point out true but irrevelant inaccuracies in a piece of writing. reply giraffe_lady 6 hours agorootparentSomething I often reflect on is the trend of engineers of all kinds being somewhat overrepresented in extremist movements. I think it&#x27;s related: discomfort with inconsistency and uncertainty can push you to extremes in any domain. And the extreme viewpoints are where black and white thinking is closest to correct, and may be useful or valued. reply mjb 19 hours agoprevThis is really great, actionable, sensible, advice for folks who write on the internet. It agrees with my experiences, too.On the other hand, it&#x27;s sad that the culture we have built on the internet forces talented people like Julia to censor themselves and narrow the scope of their writing.> So I have a weird catalog in my head of things not to mention if I don’t want to start the same discussion about that thing for the 50th time.Somehow we&#x27;ve built a culture where its socially acceptable, and even rewarded, to behave online in ways that would never be acceptable in other social settings. The exact flavors of that on HN, Slashdot, Twitter, Tumblr, etc are different, but the core issue is the same everywhere. reply lapcat 17 hours agoparent> Somehow we&#x27;ve built a culture where its socially acceptable, and even rewarded, to behave online in ways that would never be acceptable in other social settings.I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve \"built\" the culture per se. I think it&#x27;s more like humans evolved over millions of years for small, in-person groups, and we&#x27;re not \"built\" (by nature) to handle the endless sea of online strangers. On the internet, the personal familiarity is gone, the proximity is gone, the facial expressions and tone are gone, and indeed the fear of repercussions is mostly gone. reply ssgodderidge 15 hours agorootparent> On the internet, the personal familiarity is gone, the proximity is gone, the facial expressions and tone are gone, and indeed the fear of repercussions is mostly gone.The idea of writing and sharing thoughts is an ancient one. Engaging with that content in an easily publishable and shareable way, is.The quoted sentence above is 100% right. If you replace \"On the internet\" with \"In a book,\" and I think the sentence would highlight the differences with the internet a bit clearer.The internet is unique from a book because others can engage with it in a real way (beyond a book club). A book club keeps that proximity, familiarity, and expressions together for better communication. An online forum loses all of these. reply schneems 14 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you that we’re in the infancy of context free communication (text only posts). But disagree that it wasn’t built (or couldn’t be changed, my extended interpretation)There are wildly different experiences with communities online. Communities are also a thing that can be built intentionally.We can also learn from prior works. Lessig (1999) identifies four elements that regulate behavior online: Laws, norms, markets, and technology- *Code&#x2F;architecture* – the physical or technical constraints on activities (e.g. locks on doors or firewalls on the Internet)- *Market* – economic forces- *Law* – explicit mandates that can be enforced by the government- *Norms* – social conventions that one often feels compelled to follow reply lapcat 12 hours agorootparentI think the biggest factor is actually moderation. Smaller communities can be effectively moderated. This may fall under \"Norms\", but the difference is that (non-government) moderators will enforce the social conventions regardless of whether you feel compelled to follow them. But perhaps familiarity is still a factor in smaller online communities, because the participants often get to know each other.Unfortunately, larger communities are effectively beyond moderation IMO. I don&#x27;t think that the one or two moderators are enough on Hacker News, and of course the social media platforms are even worse. In the \"real world\", the non-online world, a significant portion of the population will flout the laws, regardless of government enforcement, and a significant portion will flout the social conventions. That will also occur in the online world.To put it another way, all you need is one bad reply to ruin your day. :-) reply schneems 11 hours agorootparentI’m a mod on &#x2F;r&#x2F;ruby and it’s got 80,000 subscribers. I like to think it’s not “beyond moderation”. We have fairly aggressive rules (around tone and impact) and very high standards and I would say most of the time the community meets or exceeds those standardsI think there are limits but I also don’t feel that most platforms have hit them or really even tried. Most platforms that would benefit from a stronger sense of community typically do the bare minimum to not run afoul of laws (in terms of paid moderation). Even the ones with strong volunteer mods (like Reddit) are known for underinvesting in mod tools, that’s the source of the recent protests.> one bad reply to ruin your dayOn &#x2F;r&#x2F;ruby we have two kinds of problems that bubble up intentional and unintentional. The majority of slights are unintentional and when called out are very apologetic and seek to make things right. For the intentional abusers, there’s the ban.I think of it less like building a wall and more like flattening the curve. If you can stop the cascade of frustration (where one pissed off user leads to another…) then it pays off dividends, even if you can’t catch 100% of the cases.Anyway. Thanks for the opportunity for a chat. I love thinking about this stuff. reply lapcat 10 hours agorootparent> I’m a mod on &#x2F;r&#x2F;ruby and it’s got 80,000 subscribers.I think that&#x27;s smaller than Hacker News, which has only 1 or 2 moderators, whereas it appears that r&#x2F;ruby has 8 moderators?As far as scale is concerned, it looks like r&#x2F;ruby had 19 comments within the past 24 hours? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ruby&#x2F;comments&#x2F; Whereas HN had 19 comments within the past 2 minutes. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newcomments And a site like Twitter has something like 350,000 tweets per minute.The most important difference, in my opinion, is that &#x2F;r&#x2F;ruby is focused on a single technical topic. In a sense, it&#x27;s self-selecting and self-moderating, unlike HN or social media sites which are general-interest and include topics such as politics and other controversial social issues that are prone to generate nasty disagreements. reply nomat 8 hours agorootparentprevdid you use this handle on slashnet? reply globalreset 17 hours agorootparentprev> fear of repercussions is mostly gone.Is it? Because AFAICT people censorship themselves online all the time for the fear of repercussion.

When I hear people complain about \"repercussions\" from online speech, they usually just mean criticism. And that&#x27;s all the article author seems to mean too. \"I realize this section makes me sound like a Perfectly Logical Person who does not get upset by negative public criticism, I promise this is not at all the case and I have 100000 feelings about everything that happens on the internet and get upset all the time.\"Of course famous people can get into some trouble for what they said in the past, but they usually bounce back and then find a new crowd of followers with a different ideological cast than their previous crowd of followers. reply worthless-trash 7 hours agorootparentThis is not true, regular \"anonymous randos\" get doxed regularly and the crazies call up an demand they be &#x27;fired&#x27;, they get threats to their family, friends and livelyhood. reply lapcat 7 hours agorootparentDo you have any examples? reply worthless-trash 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not in the habit of keeping recorded data of on these, but internet witch hunts are not a new thing.

But in a small familial community you can’t just be technically correct while also being an ass in how you make your point. Most of the smarmy self-righteous posts you find on Reddit would be met with an open-palm smack, or worse, if delivered in the same way to a tribal leader 10,000 years ago. All of the human connection is gone in this form of communication. It is a system filled with ideologically mind broken serfs who all jockey for a small bit of clout in order to break free of their perceived chains.

It read more like the next thing you quoted. Something&#x27;s well-trod and people have strong opinions but absolutely no one is going to change their mind or really make a novel point or learn anything new.I do think there are things that many people self-sensor, e.g. opinions that fall outside or on the edges of the orthodoxy of some bubble and is just going to trigger emotional arguments&#x2F;stereotyping&#x2F;downvotes&#x2F;etc. reply wpietri 18 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re interested in the ways in which especially women receive strident pushback in a way that trains them to self-censor, I&#x27;d suggest reading Manne&#x27;s \"Down Girl: the logic of misogyny\". She&#x27;s an analytic philosophy professor, so it&#x27;s a bit academic in spots. But I think it does a good job cataloging the many ways in which women are put \"in their place\", a place that very much includes a lot of self-censorship. reply gary_0 16 hours agorootparentWhat you&#x27;re talking about is a real thing (I&#x27;ve seen its effect on women in my life) but I&#x27;d prefer to take Julia&#x27;s post at face value, which shows her as someone with a quiet enthusiasm for tech who doesn&#x27;t enjoy pointless Internet arguments.

There are numerous topics I avoid bringing up because I know nothing productive will result from the conversation. It is rarely about politics or religion, just topics whose novelty offer a low probability of productive insights and will probably require a sufficient time investment.Choose your battles&#x2F;topics of conversation, you only have so many hours in your life. reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentprevIf it seriously challenged the orthodoxy of, say, HN, nothing&#x27;s keeping me from submitting it but, no, I probably wouldn&#x27;t comment even if it made what I think are some interesting points, in part because I&#x27;m not an expert on the area.There are some topics guaranteed to attract 500+ comments that are mostly nothing but rants about big companies, Musk, the US, etc. Better to just avoid. reply halfinvested 18 hours agorootparentprevPeople are going to feel all kinds of things. Asking whether or not they should feel them is a dead end in the context of public forums, because nobody controls anybody else&#x27;s feelings, or how each individual reacts to a feeling.Sincere, productive conversations are mostly going to take place in more private forums like group chat or face to face. Public discussion threads are better suited for identifying friends and enemies, playing and joking around, and signaling status. reply wpietri 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a dead end, because public forums are not natural phenomena. They are things we design, build, maintain, and police. Personally, I want experts to be able to talk about their work without feeling abused, harassed, or threatened. I want it not just for myself, but so that we can have a society based on truth, not just on who can shout the loudest or who can be the biggest jerk. reply halfinvested 6 hours agorootparent> I want experts to be able to talk about their work without feeling abused, harassed, or threatenedMost experts are idiots (specifically “intellectual yet idiot“).

I think it&#x27;s pretty neat, and I don&#x27;t mind saying so! But I accept that people working full time on huge Tailwind projects at work probably care way more deeply about the topic than I do, are much more impacted by aspects of Tailwind that might be trivial to me in my toy use of it, and are going to invest an amount of time and passion discussing it that would frankly bore me to death. If I were running into that repeatedly, I would stop bringing Tailwind into discussions that I didn&#x27;t want to be about Tailwind, and I wouldn&#x27;t feel that bad about it. reply wpietri 18 hours agorootparentSure, but on the other hand people can learn to read the room. I am interested in lots of things, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from trying to fit the context and the interests of the other participants. E.g., I have a lot to say about cryptocurrency, but there was a time when it seemed like almost any HN discussion ended up with a tenuous cryptocurrency tangent. It was annoying and exhausting, and I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve mostly gotten past it. reply remich 15 hours agorootparentI wonder if we&#x27;ve reached that point for LLMs&#x2F;AI&#x2F;ML yet. Sometimes it definitely seems like the discussion on HN is very influenced by the VC fad of the day. reply remich 15 hours agorootparentprevYou know, that&#x27;s interesting. I tend to avoid Tailwind discussion because I feel like I don&#x27;t see enough opinions from people working full time on huge projects using it. Most of the time, it seems like the strongest opinions in favor come from folks who have only used it in toy apps, side projects, or completely greenfield small-to-medium applications.There&#x27;s nothing wrong with using it in that way, of course, or of thinking it&#x27;s the best tool for the job in those scenarios. But for some reason I rarely see that caveat mentioned, and the idea of refactoring a legacy application to use it makes me queasy haha. reply civilitty 12 hours agorootparent> But for some reason I rarely see that caveat mentioned, and the idea of refactoring a legacy application to use it makes me queasy haha.Easiest way to check is to just add tailwind with PostCSS and the `@tailwind` directives and see what happens to your app. Unfortunately, if there&#x27;s substantial CSS it will most likely be a disaster because the Tailwind reset will clobber the assumptions made by the previous CSS. It can be really hard to refactor custom styles when you can&#x27;t see how they were supposed to look without running a separate older commit.You can try disabling the CSS reset tailwind adds but then you&#x27;ll have to chase bugs in the assumptions Tailwind makes so it&#x27;s a bit of a catch 22. If it&#x27;s a really large project with dozens of developers in its history, chances are there is already a custom CSS utility framework in place that uses the obvious formats like \"p-2\"&#x2F;\"px-2\" for padding (with a different scale, yay!) and other naming collisions.

It&#x27;s awfully convenient that \"intent doesn&#x27;t matter\", as that puts the burden of action on the speaker&#x2F;writer. If intent did matter, then the listener&#x2F;reader would need to consider what the other person is trying to say and adjust their interpretation of the words accordingly. But since it doesn&#x27;t, all that matters is that someone took offense at a particular word, and so it is the writer who needs to correct themselves. reply ToValueFunfetti 16 hours agorootparentVery much agreed. The principle of charity is an important virtue when reading things online, and only the audience is capable of bringing that to the table.I have on a number of occasions misread a statement as its opposite (skimming over a &#x27;not&#x27; or forgetting important context, perhaps). That might offend me to the point of making an argument, and I think it would be crazy for me to expect an apology rather than a \"I didn&#x27;t say that, you argumentative prick\".That&#x27;s the extreme case, where the error is unquestionably my own, but there&#x27;s a vast gray area where I might default to a less than charitable interpretation of someone&#x27;s words and they haven&#x27;t done anything wrong. For example, if someone were to describe my word choice as gross[1], I might take that as a personal insult. Putting the responsibility on the writer to account for every possible interpretation from every possible audience member is a great way to abolish good writing altogether.[1] Using this example not to go after the author here in particular, but to avoid using a more divisive example that&#x27;s not already part of the conversation reply wpietri 16 hours agorootparentprevAs a frequent writer, I think most of the burden lies upon the writer because they are the one choosing to put things in front of an audience. Yes, I think readers also have an obligation to not be, say, willfully obtuse.

This is, again, covered in Manne. I think it&#x27;s Chapter 6, the section on \"testimonial injustice\".In any case, we are talking about the sexual connotation of groping, which is not something that just the one woman speaking up experiences. So re-personalizing it back to \"Vanessa\" strikes me as a bit of an exercise in point-missing. It&#x27;s not the job of Vanessa to solve all the sexist nonsense out there. Indeed, expecting women to do the work of arguing every instance of sexism until men at last see the light is also part of sexism.In contrast, I believe it&#x27;s everybody&#x27;s job to fix sexism.

The way reply-guys impeach and dissect anything prominent women say has a silencing effect on women, so it&#x27;s misogynist. Again, I&#x27;m using Manne&#x27;s definition here.Your last paragraph makes no sense to me, but I&#x27;ll take with hope your \"That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say.\" reply deadbeeves 7 hours agorootparentMy bad, I didn&#x27;t realize we were talking about misogyny%, I thought we were talking about misogyny. In that case, let me clarify something.Misogyny, being a form of sexism, is a thought, not an action or an effect. Therefore to know if for example something someone said is misogynistic you need to understand why they said it.This misogyny% you&#x27;re speaking of is clearly not a thought (otherwise intention would matter), so it&#x27;s not sexism. If sexism didn&#x27;t exist there could be still be misogyny%, because it&#x27;s something that happens irrespective of anyone&#x27;s intentions. A woman could mishear something someone said and decide not to speak, and that would be misogyny%, I guess. The speaker was misogynistic% when he read aloud the schedule for the cafeteria because he didn&#x27;t speak clearly enough. It&#x27;s not clear to me whether eliminating misogyny% is even theoretically possible.That aside, what&#x27;s the alternative? Are you saying women shouldn&#x27;t have stuff they say critically analyzed, let alone opposed? That they should be met with either approval or silence, because otherwise some women might prefer not to speak? Isn&#x27;t that itself a misogynistic (no percent) and condescending, not to mention dangerous, idea? Think of the political idea you find most reprehensible, put it in the mouth of a female politician who sees nothing but support and take that mental image to its logical conclusion.People say stupid shit all the time. It&#x27;s not just important, but critical to challenge wrong ideas. If that means some people will speak less, and some of those people will be women, well, that&#x27;s life. I guess it&#x27;s unfortunate those people never learned how to deal with criticism. replyspondylosaurus 16 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s an example of why intent doesn&#x27;t always matter:In the Star Wars universe, the kind of music that Max Rebo plays is a lot like our Earth jazz.

Yes, \"jizz\" is indeed a vulgar slang in English. By a different etymology it is also the fictional name of a fictional musical genre that&#x27;s similar to real jazz. By yet another etymology it is also the behavioral characteristics of a bird that enable a birdwatcher to identify it. It would be entirely correct to say \"look at that jizz, that&#x27;s definitely a golden-crested pygmy goose\". Someone else listening in might be confused, but that&#x27;s their problem.Words have multiple meanings.

I&#x27;m just noting that despite (presumably) there being no vulgar intent behind the term, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that most people will read \"Max Rebo is a jizz master\" and immediately think \"lol jizz.\"Regardless of whether your intentions are pure, if a certain term instills certain associations in your audience, you can either change it to remove the association or live with the consequences of not doing so.

If you put \"define: grope\" into Google, the non-offensive definition is the first one listed:Grope (verb) 1. to feel about or search blindly or uncertainly with the hands.Which was why I latched onto this aspect in the first place - sexual groping has always been the minor definition in American English for at least the past 30 years.

I fully support people’s choices to set boundaries and block abusive behavior. At the same time, “I disagree with you so I’m going to insta-block you and not even give you a chance to clarify” seems at the heart of the brokenness of online discourse.But having seen what some of the women in my life go through re: abusive behavior online, I also understand the hair trigger.I don’t know what the right balance is, and it’s likely very personal and contextual, but I’ve personally started to only engage with conversations if I’m willing to deal with all of the likely categories of response (barring obvious abuse). Disagree=block seems to increase polarization and seems counterproductive in the long run.

I get a much, much smaller level of pushback than similar women do. When I do, the level of respect is higher, and I almost never get my credentials questioned. But I regularly see women with much stronger credentials get those inspected and&#x2F;or dismissed. Just yesterday I saw a woman with a relevant PhD getting talked down to by some random guy. And then when she made a separate post about her frustration with reply guys and how she was thinking about leaving Mastodon, some different random dude told her to \"get a live\".Historically, we spent thousands of years keeping women in \"their place\". That was partly legal, but mostly social. We&#x27;ve solved the legal stuff in the US, but only recently. (E.g., states only started to outlaw marital rape in the 1970s, and it wasn&#x27;t fully outlawed until 1992.) It should be no surprise to anybody that the social mechanisms did not magically evaporate the moment we passed some laws. And I think one of those social mechanisms is the disproportionate negativity women get from men when they are not in \"their place\". When they have the audacity to act like they know things and have valid opinions just like men do.If you want to read more on this, Manne&#x27;s \"Down Girl: the logic of misogyny\" is a very careful examination of the mechanisms and their effects. If you&#x27;re looking for \"the heart\", I think that&#x27;s a good place to continue your search. reply deadbeeves 16 hours agorootparentSorry, but how is anything of what you&#x27;ve said an example of \"putting women &#x27;in their place&#x27;\"?

Most people have abandoned discourse and refuse to have hard conversations. I’d argue that in most cases, this is counterproductive behavior. I’m also not saying this is the only thing broken - there are a myriad of systemic factors, and degrees and kinds of brokenness. Bad behavior towards women is also at the toxic core in my view. I don’t see this as either&#x2F;or.Dialogue is all we have available to change minds, and this broad erosion of communication is deeply worrisome. I’ve been beating this drum for some time.When I first read the thread, I didn’t realize the author was a woman. The point of my comment was that:1. I, too, noticed the pattern the parent comment mentioned2. While I really dislike what online discourse has become, I have empathy for the author and can understand why especially women get sick of the bullshit and just block peopleAnd that was my point about how personal and contextual decisions about these interactions are. That in this situation, I get it, but that it highlights the brokenness of the web. For what it’s worth, I’m increasingly convinced that the best move is to stop playing the social media game entirely.I appreciate the book recommendation. As a person who views misogyny as a major problem and unacceptable behavior, and has spent a decent amount of time exploring the subject, do you have an elevator pitch for the insights in the book? I add to my (long) reading list cautiously, and I guess my question is: if I’m already fully convinced that this is a problem and take it seriously, will I still find value in reading? reply wpietri 9 hours agorootparent> Most people have abandoned discourse and given up on having hard conversations.I agree that the lack of hard conversations is a problem, although I&#x27;m not sure how much people have given it up versus just never did it at all with strangers, whom computers now thrust them in virtual proximity to. But again, I don&#x27;t think the problem is with the people blocking. I think it&#x27;s with the propagandists and the purposeful jerks. I think blocking is a fine response to encountering somebody who is not only uninterested in reason, but will be a pain in the ass as they try to silence any opposition to their views. Life&#x27;s too short to waste time on the \"change my mind\" crowd. [1]> do you have an elevator pitch for the insights in the book?I think the book&#x27;s value is mainly to people of an analytical bent. Her goal is partly what philosophers call ameliorative, meaning she&#x27;s trying to sort through the many things that get called \"misogyny\" and come up with a productive definition for it. As part of that, she gives both a useful theoretical structure (especially valuable to me is her framing of misogyny as the enforcement arm of sexism, as well as her look at who is \"owed\" what and how people behave when those expectations are violated) and a lot of nuanced examinations of examples. I had no problem spotting open misogyny, but there were a lot of more subtle, stochastic examples that I only saw as a pattern after reading her book.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;memes&#x2F;steven-crowders-change-my-min... reply 0xfae 17 hours agoparentprevThere is a difference between:- What I meant to say.- The actual words I used. (And the cultural context around those words, that I may or may not be aware of).- The impact of the words I use.Like others have said, if you care about the people who are hearing your words, and they say \"hey, the words you used had a negative impact\" than it makes a lot of sense and is really not hard to say \"oh, I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ll change my words because I don&#x27;t want to make you feel that way\" and then move on.Or you can spend all day debating the intention of your words and how you didn&#x27;t mean it that way and completely ignore the actual impact, and leave people feeling like you don&#x27;t care about their feelings.In particular, in your personal relationships I highly encourage you focus on your impact rather than what you meant to say, especially when apologizing. reply haswell 8 hours agorootparentI fully agree that there are often clear distinctions between intent and impact, and that people should become more aware of this distinction and of the impact of their words.> In particular, in your personal relationships I highly encourage you focus on your impact rather than what you meant to say, especially when apologizing.I’d be more careful with this though. Ideally, this needs to look more like mutual respect&#x2F;trust, and both parties are ideally:1. Considering the impact of what they’re saying2. Giving the other person the benefit of the doubt when something doesn’t sound right, and talking about it when things seem misalignedCaring about impact is important. There’s also a failure mode here that results in complete communication breakdown as one party tries not to upset the other.Communication is intrinsically a shared experience, and both parties bear some responsibility for how things are interpreted.

HN posters LOVE to point out the fact it&#x27;s \"not like Reddit\" when, in fact, it is. If you say something factual but disagreeable with the current zeitgeist of HN (usually mid-to-far-left social policy) you will be met with downvotes. Even a small amount begins to add up until eventually your account is auto-dead (shadowbanned). This is especially bad because each downvote is not required to have a retort. Since the downvoter is not subject to the same rules it can happen freely and without consequence. New accounts are most susceptible to this. It&#x27;s often better to post extremely agreeable, astroturfed, opinions just to collect enough internet points to protect you from driveby downvoting later.The result is a hivemind no different than Reddit. People here are just as afraid to post their opinions on language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;policy as they are on Reddit.

I, like the person you&#x27;re responding to, have experienced the zeitgeist of HN and have come to the same conclusion of a prevailing mid-to-far-left social policy. Again I agree with GP on the points they make about voting, in fact I think we should get rid of votes altogether. The fact is, for most people a vote is a reflection of who they are, not the comment they&#x27;re voting on.Like I&#x27;ve said before, a comment can be downvoted by every single user on HN and still be accurate and true. The truth is the only thing that matters. Unfortunately, we&#x27;re each responsible for our own reactions to the feelings we have, and that often means, despite a commenter&#x27;s best effort, they&#x27;re still going to offend some and please others. Since we can&#x27;t please everyone, the best way to do the most good with your words is to use them to spread the truth. The truth is always going to be hard to deal with for some, but they&#x27;ll be better off with that awareness than with (perhaps blissful) ignorance because the choice of whether to stay ignorant is put into their own hands.Side note: This also reduces the total amount of suffering in the world by reducing the number of people who end up having to pay for the consequences of their actions without any awareness of the existence of the consequences (such as breaking a law you were unaware of and being put in jail for something you didn&#x27;t know was illegal) reply lapcat 14 hours agorootparent> I, like the person you&#x27;re responding to, have experienced the zeitgeist of HNI&#x27;m sure you have.

This kind of over-reaction to language is a sore spot for me; like the Stanford language guidelines, telling people not to use the word \"field\" because it implies slavery. In the same way, she assumes someone defending the word is in favor of sexual assault. This is wrong and harmful, both to others and herself.

I don&#x27;t care if someone is hurt by my blocking them if they shout slurs at me, for example, and I don&#x27;t think I should be morally obligated to consider if someone had their feelings hurt by ostracized for shouting slurs at people. reply javajosh 14 hours agorootparent>Julian Evans isn&#x27;t obligated to welcome people who wish her harmIndeed. I take issue though with assuming a person arguing that \"grope\" has meanings other than sexual assault wish her harm. That&#x27;s a stretch, to say the least. It&#x27;s certainly uncharitable and, in my view, chilling to open conversation. Moreover I think it weakens the idea of \"wishing someone harm\" by broadening it so widely that it becomes almost meaningless.There is a game I invented called \"Take it Personal\" in which one player says anodyne things to the other and the other player has to take it personally and get offended, or they lose the point. It&#x27;s a terrible game that I don&#x27;t recommend. It&#x27;s a game that everyone on the internet seems to enjoy playing, and in fact take pride in playing it and assert that anyone not playing it is a bad person.Remarkable. reply shadowgovt 13 hours agorootparentprev> But there has to be a better solution than blocking, which is ostracismMastodon has a time-gated mute feature, which is quite useful.

Of course they do. Everyone does. But is it a good thing? Isn&#x27;t being offended a bad thing? Doesn&#x27;t it feel bad to be offended, and doesn&#x27;t it also feel bad to be the person giving offense? Doesn&#x27;t it make sense to try as hard as possible to not get offended, to wait as long as possible, to give every benefit of the doubt, before being offended?The tacit assumption here is that being offended is a good thing. That its a point of pride. I disagree, very strongly. Offense weakens relationships, and dehumanizes the one giving offense. It&#x27;s not the offense is always illegitimate, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a reaction of last resort, and encouraging others to take offense is bias in the wrong direction. We should encourage others (and ourselves) to take the least offense possible. That way when we do take offense it&#x27;s quite meaningful. reply shadowgovt 13 hours agorootparent> Isn&#x27;t being offended a bad thing?No. Offense is a (complex) emotional signal that you may not be able to ally with someone because their worldview differs from yours in a way that your goals are likely to come into conflict. It&#x27;s no more bad to be offended than it&#x27;s bad to be angry, or sad, or happy; it&#x27;s an emotional signal, one that binds to a complex sociological model.> Doesn&#x27;t it make sense to try as hard as possible to not get offended, to wait as long as possible, to give every benefit of the doubt, before being offended?Maybe. Maybe not. It depends on the degree of the offense, the likelihood of adjustment of either party into a configuration where the offense is mitigated (very low for random internet interactions), and (here&#x27;s the key) the potential upside of further interaction with the other party. For an Internet rando commenting on the feed of someone they don&#x27;t know, the possible upside to that someone is low.As much as we like to, each of us, think of ourselves as insightful luminaries and Renaissance men and women of the new era, spreading truth and novel insight and peering with the greatest minds of our generation on the egalitarian footing of social media... folks like Julia get to see dozens of folks parroting the same talking points as the ones she banned daily. If she&#x27;s not planning to argue that point (and she has plenty of experience with the point to make that decision), it&#x27;s fine to just toss a \"The odds of any interaction we will have in the future producing value for either of us are near zero\" ban on the account and go on with her day. Maybe some day she&#x27;ll discover she banned someone who turns out to be fun to know in another social setting and she&#x27;ll unban them. But the odds are near zero.> We should encourage others (and ourselves) to take the least offense possible.Why? What&#x27;s the upside in a world of more than eight billion people in a context as casual as Mastodon posts?I present to you a counter-model: maybe people should learn to do a lot more reading and a lot less posting. \"Reading the room\" is a more complicated skill when the room is virtual and varies from feed to feed in something as diverse as Mastodon...

The installer of the 101.4578 beta drivers add a \"Compute Improvement Program\" (CIP) component as part of the \"typical\" setup option that is enabled by default. Under the \"custom\" installer option that you have to activate manually, you get to select which components to install. The Compute Improvement Program can be unchecked here, to ensure data collection is disabled. The benignly named CIP is a data collection component that tracks your PC usage and performance in the background (not just that of the GPU), so Intel can use the data to improve its future products. Intel created a dedicated webpage that spells out what CIP is, and what its scope of data collection is; where is says that CIP \"does not collect your name, email address, phone number, sensitive personal information, or physical location (except for country).\" Intel CIP is functionally similar to the Telemetry component of the GeForce Software. NVIDIA's Telemetry is installed and enabled by default along with your GeForce graphics drivers, and you cannot opt out from it, as it does not even figure in the \"custom\" installer options. AMD handles its version of CIP and Telemetry in arguably the most transparent manner. The installer of AMD Software Adrenalin presents the option to prevent its data-collection tool from being enabled at the completion of driver installation, regardless of whether you've chosen the \"typical,\" \"driver only,\" or \"custom\" install options. There's an entire page of the installer dedicated to this, you see a large checkbox about data-collection that's checked by default, but which you can uncheck, and complete installation.

Those removing telemetry with clean driver tools only make bugs take longer to fix. Posted on Aug 7th 2023, 3:10 #7 chrcoluk Not surprising, I am surprised though they didnt do this from day 1. Think of how the bug finding normally works, unlike reviewers the typical end user has to report things to standard tech support of which there is triage process in place, so many reports might be incorrectly fobbed off or not end up at the right place, telemetry bypasses it all. Dev's need to be upfront though, explain telemetry is in use, and provide options for the level of telemetry one is ok providing. As part of the issues there is distrust, people dont know if data is collected about PC, or just for the drivers. I recently uninstalled google drive as an example, I discovered it was attaching a crash reporter process to all my firefox processes, all msedge processes, all notepad processes, to some games, and to some media apps. There was no information on this in google drive itself, and I couldnt find a way to adjust its settings or disable it, I could only remove it by uninstalling google drive windows app. Firefox now starts about 3x as fast when I launch it. Posted on Aug 7th 2023, 3:28 #8 Assimilator I'm very interested to understand what category of websites I visit, have anything to do with a driver not working. I don't really care though, since I only use the Intel driver on a work laptop and DGAF if they know the sites I browse there. _JP_ It's for a beta driver, which is in development. I'm surprised people are not finding it the norm that beta drivers are to provide feedback to the developers by default, as opposed to stable WHQL releases. It's in the latest WHQL 4577. Nostras If I had to guess there's a local lookup for website to category. If found it will send it, otherwise it won't. Doesn't explicitly state the SW won't be able to see the URL, just that it won't phone that information home. I very much doubt that. Rather, the telemetry collector will call out to a third-party company that does URL classification, with some sort of obfuscated/encrypted payload containing an URL, and that company will return the URL category. That way there is no way for the classifying company to know who was browsing that URL, while the driver knows the user and category but allegedly disposes of the URL. Posted on Aug 7th 2023, 3:34 #9 Verpal With the complexity of GPU driver and likely extraordinarily poor quality each support ticket provide manufacturer with information.... I am surprised Intel take this long to turn telemetry on by default. Unlikely the days before gaming GPU from Intel, people expect different things now, back then Intel only need to concern with quicksync, and those few important producitivity software work as intended, then a couple low spec competitive game work decently well, and that's it. But now, every game had to be supported, one way or another, I hope telemetry does help Intel getting more competitive in GPU space in long run.

The problem with the dystopia is that if you bought the product, it really is for your own good because then shit might actually get fixed proper :D The solution therefore is: 'don't buy' or 'buy something that works the right way'. Its why I switched to AMD after decades of Nvidia now. Nvidia is a software company now before a Geforce GPU manufacturer. They just stick Geforce on an enterprise cut down and plaster endless waves of software on top to make it good (or, sell). Ada is the first most blatant example, selling almost exclusively on DLSS3, because RT isn't flying after 3 iterations of enterprise cut downs. Posted on Aug 7th 2023, 6:15 #12 b1k3rdude Same response to the nvidia driver.... that is a hard F**k, NOPE. So if and when I ever install an arq card, I may need an intel Arq version of \"NV clean install\" to strip out ant Geforce Exp. like crap crap and then block the driver from talking to the internet via windows firewall (via WFC) as I do for the nvidia driver.

Ada is the first most blatant example, selling almost exclusively on DLSS3, because RT isn't flying after 3 iterations of enterprise cut downs. What absolute rubbish. Ada is unquestionably both the most powerful and efficient GPU architecture NVIDIA has ever produced. To quote W1zz's review of the 4090: +45% vs RTX 3090 Ti. Yup, 45% faster than last generation's flagship—this is probably the largest jump Gen-over-Gen for many years. Compared to RTX 3080 the uplift is 89%—wow!—almost twice as fast Energy efficiency is almost doubled compared to cards like RTX 3090 / 3090 Ti As for its ray-tracing: While previously enabling RT at 4K always meant some compromises—either upscaling or reduced settings—the RTX 4090 will give you 60 FPS with RT active in nearly all titles. That is not software, that is pure brute force hardware engineering. Posted on Aug 7th 2023, 7:37 #15 Vayra86 Assimilator What absolute rubbish.

Allow me to be more precise: most powerful and efficient architecture compared to the previous generation, in multiple generations. And don't go moving the goalposts.

They're diversifying into a software oriented company too, let's put it that way then ;) And its already been true for quite a while that you dó buy a Geforce for its better software suite/feature set, its CUDA support that works in software, etc. DLSS3 is another such item, as much as Shadowplay, Ansel, etc. An Nvidia GPU without it loses a big chunk of its attractiveness. Also, the more precise comment still only and exclusively applies to the 4090. Posted on Aug 7th 2023, 8:02 #18 Xex360 They lost lots of money on Ark, they need to make some of it back.

We got more bugs, chrashes and even data loss since we've allowed telemetry in the first place - updates where never getting better. Only worse. A thing that telemetry can make worse is a developer finds it if a feature has low usage, then it can mean the feature gets dropped as then easier to maintain code, then users of said feature become unhappy. I think it also led to nagware prompts, developer makes new feature wants everyone to use, gets low take up, so software then keeps nagging you to use the feature. It becomes really obvious the desperation when the nag prompts dont allow you to say no as a permanent answer but rather \"not now\", common place on android apps.

Posted on Aug 7th 2023, 10:36 #22 Fouquin _JP_ I'm surprised people are not finding it the norm that beta drivers are to provide feedback to the developers by default, as opposed to stable WHQL releases. If beta builds were even remotely optional than perhaps it would be excusable to shoehorn such features in. The problem right now is Intel is shipping beta drivers that are required to even get a game to run correctly. Remnant II for example was a hot mess with half the screen obscured by artifacts for the first week and with performance dips into the single digits. Solution? Intel dropped a beta driver that allows the game to render correctly in conjunction with a beta build of the game itself. So sure, data collection on beta drivers would be okay for debugging purposes if the WHQL drivers allowed the GPU to function correctly in games. Assimilator Your claim was that \"NVIDIA is a software company\" Because they are, and have been for a long time. Their predominant retail customer isn't one that wants to buy GeForce, their predominant retail customer is one that needs CUDA. CUDA is a software ecosystem with a hardware lock around it. What's the difference between a class RTX card and a consumer GeForce class RTX card with the same chip? Software. What allows one card to support 10-bit precision and another 12-bit despite being the same architecture? Software. NVIDIA creates more proprietary software ecosystems than physical hardware generations. Take a moment to browse their open job listings and see that for every one hardware/network/ASIC engineer position they post, there are 15-20 software engineer positions open. This isn't new.

No option to de-select present. The data collection program is starting randomly and is eating quite some system resources, which could lead to lags in games. It is also sending out tons of data, which is quite bad if you're on a data cap. :shadedshu: Luckily you can de-install the backpacked program in the Windows control panel, which you have to repeat each time when you update the tool.

KDE gets better every week. Be the owner of your technology. Join us! reply hef19898 19 hours agoparentLinux is great! And, thanks to Steam, a lot of games wirk as well. Not all, but most.Ubuntu, I haven&#x27;t tried anything else so far, is a charm on Lenovo hardware. Update wise, it is were Windows was a couple of years ago. Meaning there are random updates that just kill and break certain functions. Happened last week, everything was running fine, including steam, as it always did. Until an update managed to delete the GUI, reinstalling the GUI killed nVidia drivers, Steam couldn&#x27;t be installed under 23.04 for some missing dataset, installing said data (some 32-bit stuff) killed WiFi...No attack on Linux so, I rember that not too long ago I stopped all Eindows updates because for months the auto-updates had the same effect (save the WiFi bit).So yes, my dqily, private driver is Linux. And will be, except for games, for the time being. All I uave to do now, well after vacation, is to get Steam running properly again. Feels like a throwback to the pre Win 10 days, when Windows randomly did the same thing with regards to drivers and certain games &#x2F; programs. reply bee_rider 18 hours agorootparentIt is unfortunate that people recommended Ubuntu as a starting distro for so long.It does too much. It will update things for you, or give you a pop-up to tell you to update. Updates happen all at once, rather than a little at a time, so you get these big dramatic updates with combinatorial bug explosions. Maybe the repos will be gone if you don’t update in time. Maybe your favorite packages have moved from apt to snap. Good luck!A rolling release distro like Arch would be a better first experience for most people I think.Linux is not where Windows was years ago. Software gently rolls in at a nice steady rate. Some distros choose to take that nice steady flow, chop it up, and for some reason emulate the Windows catastrophic update experience. It is… an odd decision. reply ASalazarMX 13 hours agorootparentPlease use Ubuntu LTS, you can live with 2-year old versions at its worst, specially when snaps can deliver up-to-date applications.I&#x27;m not happy with some of Canonical&#x27;s decisions, but I can&#x27;t deny that using LTS as a daily driver is boring because most things just work without fiddling. I don&#x27;t have as much time to fiddle with the OS nowadays. reply bee_rider 12 hours agorootparentI’ve used LTS on a shared system, but I don’t love it. 2 years is shorter than you’d expect, and now if we want to update we’ll need to deal with 2 years worth of work, configuration, and cluges if we want to update. reply hedora 12 hours agorootparentprevUbuntu LTS breaks my stuff more often than Manjaro (~= Arch).I don&#x27;t understand why Canonical decides to backport breaking changes to LTS releases, but they do it on a regular basis, and I don&#x27;t trust them for anything important. (I&#x27;m not suggesting using manjaro for stuff that needs to be stable over a long time period -- it&#x27;s not meant for that, which is precisely my point!) reply boppo1 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been using xubuntu for about 6 years now and I barely understand how linux works. So far so good, I&#x27;ve had one major issue which was related to my storage getting too full.Admittedly I&#x27;m reasonably comfortable in CLI, but I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about bash, just cd, mv, cp, ls -a, etc.Is xubuntu better than ubuntu just because it removes a lot of cruft? reply fuomag9 15 hours agorootparentXubuntu or *buntu distros are mostly Ubuntu distros with a different default desktop environment (KDE, xfce, etc) reply f1shy 13 hours agorootparentprevThe worst is when they tried to call home, like Windows reply hef19898 17 hours agorootparentprevThe issue described above was the only update problem I had with Ubunutu so far. The reason I picked it was the basically guaranteed compatability with my Lenovo laptop, I guessed better not take any risks. popOS was on the list as well so!Positive side effect of above tepuble shooting, I got pretty fast installing Linux now. reply crawsome 16 hours agorootparentprev>so you get these big dramatic updates with combinatorial bug explosions.Yes. My Ubuntu installations always have bugs when I do big updates. AAnd while I&#x27;m here, snapd can suck it. Me and my homies hate Snap. reply BizarroLand 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve not had a good experience with Ubuntu or Pop OS. They&#x27;ve always felt sluggish on any hardware I&#x27;ve put them on.Debian may take a touch more wrenching to get running but it has been good for me, although I haven&#x27;t tried 12 yet. Fedora was good but Red Hat shenanigans seems to have messed with it.I may try Mint next time. I&#x27;ve heard good things about it.I said all of that to say, isn&#x27;t Linux great?If you have a quibble with it, you can kick it to the curb and try something else in an hour and everything just works. There&#x27;s so many options to choose from, and you don&#x27;t have weirdo corporations tracking your every application launch or building a psychological profile off of you from how you tab through a spreadsheet or cloud mapping your speaking patterns based off of how you type. reply joshspankit 8 hours agorootparentSince you want responsive, try XFCE (xubuntu) reply caeril 10 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, Arch is likely the best introductory option, especially now that archinstall comes with the iso. Dead simple to install, and the documentation is fantastic for setting up the rest of your environment. reply erwincoumans 18 hours agorootparentprevIt would be great if Linux had some automatic checkpoints so you can revert to a working system after an update. So many times updates leave a broken system and re-install Ubuntu from scratch is quicker than fixing the problem. reply usr1106 17 hours agorootparentOpenSUSE had this 7 years ago when I last used it. I think they still have it, it&#x27;s called snapper.Not that I would really have turned any Linux significantly non-functional by updating during the last 15 years. But it&#x27;s all software, so everything can happen one day... reply boomboomsubban 18 hours agorootparentprevBootable snapshots are a thing, also known as boot environments. You need to use ZFS or btrfs, or possibly bcachefs or LVM offer them. And they never have seemed to have a great implementation on Linux compared FreeBSD, but they do exist. reply tredre3 17 hours agorootparent> but they do exist.And here&#x27;s the crux of it, isn&#x27;t it? Unless it&#x27;s accessible and enabled by default, it might as well not exist from the PoV of the end user.Windows&#x27; restore points happen automatically before updates or driver updates. Then you&#x27;re prompted automatically to restore if Windows fails to boot after an update.As usual Linux has all the pieces but no desire to create UX to go with it. Which is a shame because ZFS with automatic snapshotting daily or before major events combined with a simple UI that can run in the preboot environment would be a game changer and make Windows look like a toy. reply dizhn 13 hours agorootparentOpenSUSE Tumbleweed has this. The installer defaults to btrfs and snapshots using snapper. Snapshots are automatic before and after every package manager operation. Save for something that breaks grub, you can always recover. reply bravetraveler 10 hours agorootparentIn that spirit, if you have an EFI system, you don&#x27;t need GRUB reply boomboomsubban 9 hours agorootparentYou sort of do if you want to boot kernels on btrfs. Refind is an option, but not most of the other EFI bootloaders. reply bravetraveler 9 hours agorootparentAh, good point - I neglected the BTRFS involvement&#x2F;need to find kernels... that one would ideally include with these snapshots, of course reply vladvasiliu 16 hours agorootparentprev> And here&#x27;s the crux of it, isn&#x27;t it? Unless it&#x27;s accessible and enabled by default, it might as well not exist from the PoV of the end user.For what it&#x27;s worth, at one point Ubuntu supported installing on ZFS through its regular installer and installed the boot environment thingy, with a snapshot before every update. I have one such machine which is now running 23.04 and that still works. I&#x27;ve never had to use in practice, though. reply hef19898 17 hours agorootparentprevOh, so this! Having had the option last Friday to just reboot into whatever it was before said update, and just skip the next couple of updates, man, that would have been great! reply tracker1 11 hours agorootparentprevI haven&#x27;t had that happen for a few years now... I will say the RX 5700 XT had a really rough few months after launch on Linux. Other than that, it&#x27;s been relatively smooth.Mostly been using PopOS and Ubuntu-Budgie. reply joshspankit 7 hours agorootparentprevOnce NixOS is desktop-ready you’ll have a way more powerful checkpoint system reply justinclift 17 hours agorootparentprevSome Linux distros actually do this. :) reply aednichols 15 hours agorootparentprevCheck out immutable distros like Fedora Silverblue & Kinoite. reply michaelmrose 17 hours agorootparentprevTo be pedantic It&#x27;s impossible for \"Linux\" to have this as this exists way higher than the kernel or even the filesystem layer.Linux mint has timeshift.The now defunct Project Trident installer set up a zfs root with zfsbootmenu and an update script that automatically sets up a boot environment you can revert and boot from with the built in feature of zfsbootmenu.Both let you achieve your goal. You can set up either system even if they aren&#x27;t built in. reply rkagerer 17 hours agorootparentA lot of comments here say Timeshift is crap - do you find it helpful yourself and can you elaborate on what works &#x2F; doesn&#x27;t?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.linuxmint.com&#x2F;software&#x2F;view&#x2F;timeshift reply michaelmrose 11 hours agorootparentI have not personally used timeshift. I have used zfsbootmenu and syncoid found it useful and fit for purpose. Personally I think its more reasonable to separate boot environments from backing up as they are two separate if related concerns. EG boot environments are for when something went wrong with an update and backups are for when your drive failed. If both went wrong you just do both operations in sequence restore from backup and THEN pick the prior boot environment and make it the default.Insofar as timeshift consider the review source, circumstances, and nature of complaints. Users who don&#x27;t have difficulties rarely post anything and yet many reviews are positive. Those that aren&#x27;t seem to focus on people who didn&#x27;t realize they could provide a secondary drive and just kept storing data until their OS drive filled up.Mint leans heavily towards technically incompetent users and yet many people were able to use it successfully. Meeting every users needs no matter how incapable is probably a poor benchmark to define if somethings is \"crap\" or not even if those users problems are are a great guideline to a path forward to helping all users better.For instance it might be better if timeshift only supported a fs with snapshots instead of rsync and required a secondary disk and warned of space issues long before the disk fills up but it seems quite possible to competently use it right now. replyo1y32 18 hours agoparentprev> Everything just worksNo it doesn&#x27;t. Every Linux desktop requires me to spend hours tweaking things or finding workarounds to make it usable for myself. Window management is horrible compared to other OS. Fractional scaling mostly doesn&#x27;t work. The Pomodoro timer in the \"Software\" store is no longer maintained and doesn&#x27;t work at all on the latest Gnome. (Windows 11 has it built-in). Even so, I have to live with certain restrictions. I tried to get into Linux desktop every few years, and I never find the situation has improved much.By comparison, setting up the environment on Windows or MacOS takes no more than a fem minutes. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 17 hours agorootparentIt takes me days to make Windows usable for myself by hosing all the garbage off it. And it&#x27;s still a miserable experience. On the other hand, if I just install a batteries included Linux distro I get something I&#x27;m not necessarily thrilled about, but I can go pretty much straight to work. And if I spend a few days, I can set up a system that&#x27;s exactly tailored the way I want it to be, eats an order of magnitude less RAM than Windows, and doesn&#x27;t regularly break itself by forcing updates on me, changing settings from under me, etc.MacOS is somewhat better than Windows(less garbage to hose off), but it&#x27;s not worth the money of buying the overpriced unrepairable and unupgradeable hardware it runs on. reply musicale 17 hours agorootparent> It takes me days to make Windows usable for myself by hosing all the garbage off it.I guess it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re used to.

All these exchanges of experiences boil down to people rationalising their own preferences, which are really just about familiarity. I do it too. I&#x27;m really just more familiar with Linux systems because I used it since I was 10-12, and as a main OS since I was about 14(I&#x27;m 30 now).My view is that Windows being more user friendly is really just a myth. Most non-technical people use their Windows PCs or macs for the same 4 different tasks they always have. Ask them to do something new or do some troubleshooting and they&#x27;ll struggle with it and get nowhere. Whether they&#x27;re staring at a terminal window with no idea what to type or a \"troubleshooting wizard\" that offers no useful advice and links to an MSDN article with no useful information, is really irrelevant. They&#x27;ll still need help from a technical person.And technical people like us all just prefer what we&#x27;re more familiar with too. reply faeriechangling 12 hours agorootparentprevSure, attempting to make Windows into Linux by “decrapifying” it is harder, but if you use Windows as intended and upload all your documents to Microsoft’s cloud it is easier for the vast vast majority of users.Windows breaking itself with updates is less a symptom of Windows and more of a side-effect of “decrapification”. I’ve seen a pretty damn large sample size of windows users undergoing windows updates and Windows Update does really not break computers other than by annoyingly changing your defaults to Microsoft stuff “woops, by accident” but if you do stuff like use Edge as your default browser it stops breaking.Apple forces you to use their defaults, Microsoft theirs, and Google theirs. When you accept these companies operating system is not Linux, and stop acting like they are Linux, and stop acting like you own your windows PC, they do become pretty simple to use.If you want a PC you can own, you use Linux. Linux is great. My grandmother uses Microsoft Windows in S mode with edge as her browser. Her photos get backed up. She only uses Edge at 175% DPI scaling and maybe looks up a few family photos. It is easier for her than using Linux because she’s familiar with it and because nobody has taught her that unless she is using Windows for education without a decrapify script she is doing things all wrong. reply mrguyorama 18 hours agorootparentprevPeople are acting like Linus Sebastian and that other guy didn&#x27;t JUST RECENTLY demonstrate Linux to still be a tough sell to non-linux gurus for daily driving. reply nwallin 11 hours agorootparentHe deliberately shitcanned his system to generate clicks. What are people going to say if an uppity linux fanboy youtuber shows himself deleting system32 and then crying about Windows is unusable for non-Windows gurus for daily driving? They&#x27;re going to say he&#x27;s an idiot and move on.When I instruct my package manager to uninstall your desktop environment, and the package manager says, \"You are about to delete critical system components. Are you sure? (yes&#x2F;no)\" and I type in \"yes\" I expect my package manager to uninstall the desktop environment. That is the correct thing for it to do. Anything else is the wrong thing to do.\"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.\" -Douglas Adams reply bravetraveler 10 hours agorootparentLet&#x27;s not forget, that while he did kind of shrug and agree to remove everything... that was a problem in the packaging spec.The package (Steam, if memory serves?) should not have had the other packages referenced as they were. The dependency&#x2F;requirement resolution was faulty...Then he didn&#x27;t truly take in the message and this is the result we get.There&#x27;s plenty of \"probably say no if you don&#x27;t know what this means\" in what he ignored. Fault is all over. - His distribution of choice [or] the repository supporting it - him for not reading and acting accordingly - sheer chanceHad he chosen another distribution at random, there&#x27;s little chance that would have happened.If he repeated it on the same one now, it wouldn&#x27;t happen. When you choose a niche distribution, you get niche problems.My entire family manages fine on &#x27;bleeding edge&#x27; Fedora, yet it doesn&#x27;t market itself this way. Packaging is specifically in their domain of expertiseThis isn&#x27;t to say Linux is for everyone, but I really wish for a more fair representation.As the reporters they should have dug in a bit more.

Their endless and senseless configuration changes make Windows not work. reply risho 18 hours agorootparentprevyou are correct about fractional scaling being suboptimal and there are a few quirks here and there but linux has become largely usable at this point. most of the criticisms you have made about linux are due to inexperience and not being familiar with it rather than being fundamental problems with it. If instead of spending the last x years of your life daily driving windows or macos you had instead spent that time daily driving linux you would have all of the understanding infrastructure built up around linux instead and these would be non problems. I use fedora with gnome and I don&#x27;t install any extensions or do any tweaking or workarounds as you say.I know this is true because i&#x27;m a non developer, non power user (though still relatively technical) who has been using linux since 2006 and it works just fine. Not only that my dad has been happily setup using linux since around 2014 and he is as non technical as they come.To really go in on this point I bought a macbook pro when the m1 devices came out and the experience you have with linux I have with macos. It&#x27;s the worst operating system I have ever used. You complain about linux having bad window management but macos has basically no window management. you double click the top bar and depending on the software sometimes it will maximize, sometimes it will pull the window all the way down the screen and sometimes it will do nothing at all. You drag the window to the top or to the side and nothing happens at all. Window management on macos is so bad that most people say that you need to install external tools to mac it even half way usable. Even when you do its still less performant and buggier than what gnome or windows offers out of the box. You say macos needs no setup, but I spent 10&#x27;s of hours desperately trying to make the workflow and ux of macos not be a horrible experience for me. Everything from no tools and trying to work within its paradigm, simple window management tools even going so far as to trying yabai and none of them felt right to me.Now that said I would bet a person who has spent a decade daily driving macos probably has internalized the ins and outs and quirks relating to macos and wouldn&#x27;t find it nearly as problematic. Most of the issues people have with linux are much less problems with linux and much more a lack of workflow understanding that they haven&#x27;t built up but have built up around other operating systems instead.The main exception being that there are some proprietary tools that are pretty explicitly not supported on linux which require windows or macos. reply gambiting 19 hours agoparentprev>> Everything works.I&#x27;m a video games developer.

However, VSTs are distributed as executables targeting a specific platform, and almost no VSTs are compiled natively for Linux.If you&#x27;re already content with Reaper as a DAW, use \"yabridge\" which runs VSTs in WINE.

For hardware iLok and other stuff, yeah, you&#x27;re pretty stuck, they usually use goofy hacks or custom drivers that can&#x27;t be handled in WINE. Someone would have to reverse engineer the DRM and figure out how to redirect the licensing methods.

If you&#x27;re saying that it just recently got added then that&#x27;s extremely sad that it took this many decades. Surely a few decades more until it&#x27;s the default, thoughEDIT: ha, I just looked it up. exactly as I remember, you need to use a modifier key to do any dropping. And it opens a dialog half the time instead of just doing it. I&#x27;m 99.99% sure it&#x27;s not integrated with bash at all, let alone the OS, meaning you can&#x27;t drag and drop a path from one program to another. Something you could probably do starting in windows 95 reply Tmpod 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure I understand what you&#x27;re describing but I believe Plasma and Dolphin work like that. If you drag and drop a file into a program it will select that file (if it expects a dropped file) or paste the path. You can also drag and drop files inside Dolphin itself to move or copy stuff around. I think what&#x27;s confusing you is that, by default, it doesn&#x27;t assume a move and prompts you to pick between that and copy, and you can force the choice and prevent the prompt by holding a key while dragging. You can, however, change this behavior in the settings to instead mimick Windows explorer.Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. reply iraqmtpizza 8 hours agorootparentIt may be gnome (which is even worse). But if you&#x27;re correct about the setting to change the behavior, then this is a non-default (setting) of a non-default (desktop environment) in Ubuntu.

Based on around 20 seconds of googling it seems like GeForce Experience has some flags that&#x27;ll start some things up directly (this may be how they&#x27;re managed by the interface, I&#x27;m not sure). This should include shadowplay if you pass it the `-shadowplay` flag.It&#x27;s a bit worrying that it already requires this though, the whole thing is as close as it can be to DRM without obviously being DRM. And Nvidia is known to DRM their GPUs a lot. reply xnyanta 20 hours agorootparentprevYou can still use alternate front-ends to \"shadowplay\" like OBS replay buffer. reply LoganDark 19 hours agorootparentOne of the huge sells of ShadowPlay is that it doesn&#x27;t place extra burden on Windows to capture the screen every frame, instead it directly captures the actual framebuffer (and encodes the frames) directly on the GPU, without having to switch or bottleneck any rendering code paths. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if people who swear by ShadowPlay can tell the performance difference compared to software screen capture.Basically it aims to replace the need to for an additional out-of-band capture card (those can get very expensive, especially if you want 4k60). reply Aerroon 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be running into much performance difference between the two. People say GameCapture already grabs the frame buffer, but I can&#x27;t say whether that&#x27;s true or not. reply LoganDark 12 hours agorootparentMost likely, different framebuffer - ShadowPlay grabs the exact frames sent to the physical monitor while GameCapture intercepts it in software (most likely anyway, if it doesn&#x27;t use the Nvidia-specific APIs that ShadowPlay does). The former doesn&#x27;t require inserting any extra steps into the rendering pipeline, so it&#x27;s generally faster (sometimes by a lot). reply Aerroon 13 hours agorootparentprevWhile you can&#x27;t use ShadowPlay you can use Nvidia&#x27;s hardware encoding with software like OBS to do the same thing as ShadowPlay. Actually, it&#x27;s even better because you can configure OBS to only do it in RAM. reply LoganDark 12 hours agorootparentA good portion of the overhead that ShadowPlay addresses is actually video capture, not just encoding&#x2F;compression - but IME it&#x27;s true that even NVENC on its own can take a good load off the CPU. reply horsawlarway 20 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t this at least make some sense?

ShadowPlay also allows you to capture the output of your GPU without having to insert an external capture card in between. It essentially uses NVENC to generate a video stream before it even leaves the graphics card, so the CPU doesn&#x27;t have to do nearly as much work. reply ineedasername 20 hours agorootparentprevYou are equivocating with the use of “record” in two different senses if that word.

Everyone has their price, not everyone has the luxury of being so picky with their carriers, especially when it comes to having a big name like Intel on your resume. You go to work, implement the tickets assigned to you, then go home, without vocalizing on the ethics of the big picture, is what the vast majority of employees do.If you want this practice to end you have to legally regulate it, the free market alone doesn&#x27;t work in favor of the end user&#x27;s privacy. Without laws and regulations in place, if Intel won&#x27;t do it, all the other companies would. It&#x27;s why regulations are important.Plus, I think half of HN userbase built their wealth or currently works for FAANG companies that make their money from spying, tracking or monetizing user data for ads, so the stone you threw will break a lot of glass here. How do you think they justify it other than \"I like money\"? So why single out only Intel engineers for what is common place around these parts? reply JohnFen 19 hours agorootparent> What do you expect them to do?If they can&#x27;t bring themselves to do what&#x27;s right, the least they can do is be ashamed of what they&#x27;re doing.> So why single out only Intel engineers for what is common place around these parts?Because this particular example is about Intel.

Nobody criticizes those who work at Google or Meta here. There&#x27;s more talk about maximizing your TC there, than telling people not to work there.Double standards, probably because Intel doesn&#x27;t pay as good as Google&#x2F;Meta so it&#x27;s easy to throw stones where you don&#x27;t plan to work anyway, but people stay quiet when it comes to places where they earn their wealth. reply JohnFen 18 hours agorootparent> Nobody criticizes those who work at Google or Meta here.What can I say? I see such criticism frequently. I even pile onto it from time to time. reply FirmwareBurner 18 hours agorootparentThey criticize only the companies but not the workers who choose to work there like how the original poster choose to criticize those working at Intel for implementing telemetry. That&#x27;s the difference. Meta&#x2F;Google workers aren&#x27;t judged here for working at these un-ethical companies. reply JohnFen 17 hours agorootparent> Meta&#x2F;Google workers aren&#x27;t judged here for working at these un-ethical companies.Sure they are. I&#x27;ve seen comments like these aimed at workers of those companies far more than workers at Intel.

You&#x27;re connecting to their servers to use the service on their servers. You also don&#x27;t pay them anything by default.For Nvidia you&#x27;re expected to pay $1000 for a graphics card and then they will collect data on you and send it to their servers even though you didn&#x27;t choose to use their online services at all. reply speed_spread 20 hours agoparentprevFrame the mirror with their pay stubs?

The officers went to the offices along Mombasa Road armed with a search warrant and left with machines they believe stores data gathered by the firm. The team took the data to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis. Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait defended her office and said Tools for Humanity, the parent company of Worldcoin, failed to disclose its true intentions during registration. The government has suspended Worldcoin’s operations in Kenya, citing security concerns paving the way for investigations into the activities of the company. However, privacy experts worry that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person’s iris might get into the wrong hands. The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) stated it was concerned about the ongoing registration and notified Kenyans that Worldcoin was not regulated in Kenya. Under Kenyan law, individuals have a right to not have any personal information unnecessarily required or unnecessarily revealed. Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned. ADVERTISEMENT. SCROLL TO CONTINUE READING.  On Thursday, Worldcoin said it is planning to implement crowd-control measures and collaborate with the government before resuming work. Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned. It claims to be creating a new global “identity and financial network”. Altman, who founded Open AI, which built chat bot ChatGPT, says he hopes the initiative will help confirm if someone is a human or a robot. He also says this could lead to everyone being paid a universal basic income but it is not clear how. Worldcoin says it chose Kenya as the first African country to launch the platform because of the already booming tech space, and the more than four million Kenyans who are already trading in crypto. It has also launched in various countries including Indonesia, France Japan, Germany, Spain and the UK. Data watchdogs in some countries have already said they are examining Worldcoin. Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki suspended the firm’s activities in Kenya to pave the way for a probe into the legality of its operations. He Thursday appeared before Parliament to among other issues state the precautionary steps taken by the government on the already mined data. “The aforesaid entity is not registered as a legal entity in Kenya.” ADVERTISEMENT.

That doesn&#x27;t match my experience with it. reply mcpar-land 10 hours agorootparentWhen you ask ChatGPT to write a piece of code that does a thing, it is not reasoning about what the code should do, modeling the problem in its head, figuring out how to translate that into code, then writing it. The neural weights are spitting up a piece of code it determines would probably come after your prompt, based on similarity to a kajillion StackOverflow answers, GitHub repos, textbooks, etc etc. It is not coming up with a solution, just giving you the average answer to the million most similar questions.ChatGPT can “write code” in the most literal sense that it will give you code when given a prompt, but (unlike how OpenAI markets-by-omission) it does not reason about code like an AGI could. reply simonw 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not particularly interested in AGIs (I&#x27;m kind of hoping they don&#x27;t happen) - but for my purposes the illusion of LLMs being able to code is now good enough that I&#x27;m using them to write good, working code for me on a daily basis.Here&#x27;s a recent example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2023&#x2F;Aug&#x2F;6&#x2F;annotated-presentations... reply nyolfen 9 hours agorootparentprevgpt is clearly capable of constructing and interacting with a model of the world -- there was a famous example in the microsoft bing paper where they described a complex maze and had it reason its way out. &#x27;predicting what it thinks is most similar to stackoverflow&#x27; etc does not explain any of its behavior in a meaningful way, unless you are willing to apply this description to human intellectual labor. gpt4 is clearly not sentient, but what is shocking about it is that it demonstrates that honest-to-god cognition can be decoupled from sentience.btw, i think i have tended to see these pessimistic takes by people who have only used 3.5, which is impressive but not reliable -- i strongly recommend using 4 in the course of your job to see how useful it is. every day in the course of interacting with it, it produces novel lines of thought which shock me. replycatchnear4321 16 hours agorootparentprevyou forgot the part about the shiny metal orb.it really changes the flavor of it from cambridge analytica to dr evil. reply rchaud 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m starting to think Bond villains need to have a \"satire\" disclaimer to pre-empt future Stanford kids from thinking it&#x27;s something to aspire to. reply redler 15 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;ll still have Atlas Shrugged. reply Hamuko 15 hours agorootparentprevAlternative subtitle track that just displays \"(this guy is the bad guy)\" when the villain is visible on screen. reply mrguyorama 14 hours agorootparentHow can he be the villain, he has all the money so he must be the good guy! reply rchaud 6 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps a health bar that depletes as the good guy chips away at his evil plans? reply scrps 16 hours agorootparentprevI would hope both would set off alarm bells but I guess at least one of them inducing trepidation is cause enough these days for guarded optimism. reply kbenson 16 hours agorootparentOne of them is easy to include in thrilling action movies that allows the idea and risk to enter public consciousness, and the other is something that economics wonks and people interested in how business works at high levels look at.Protagonist 1: \"I don&#x27;t get it, why are they doing this?

What will we do?\"Audience: Laughs at this shit being played so straight it comes off as a farce. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentThe problem with regulatory capture is it makes everybody look bad.The usual morality play is either the evil business hurting people who has to be stopped by the benevolent government regulators, or the evil government regulators hurting innocent businesses who are just trying to make a living and keep prices down and keep jobs from moving offshore.To which the traditional solutions are either more regulations that businesses don&#x27;t like or fewer regulations that businesses don&#x27;t like.Regulatory capture is when the villains of both sides are working together, and the solution to it is fewer regulations that big businesses do like. But nobody wants to see their hero as a villain so anything that accurately portrays this is unpopular. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> The problem with regulatory capture is it makes everybody look badThe other problem is this isn&#x27;t how regulatory capture happens. OpenAI was flexing its badass credentials in the halls of Congress while it wrapped up a multibillion-dollar fundraise. There was no path from Altman&#x27;s testimony to any sort of regulatory apparatus that wouldn&#x27;t immediately constrain him. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the usual theory for this that they&#x27;re pulling up the ladder? They get billions in funding which they can use to absorb regulatory overhead, then the regulations come which price out early stage competitors and make it harder for anyone else to raise the kind of funding they&#x27;ve already secured. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> Isn&#x27;t the usual theory for this that they&#x27;re pulling up the ladder?Actual capture involves industry coöpting existing regulators through revolving doors and burdensome rules that reduce the threat of new entrants. It happens quietly. The only times industry proposes new frameworks in public is when they&#x27;re cornered.The \"regulatory capture\" playbook OpenAI purported to follow has zero actual precedent. It is only rhetorically precedented in crypto, where the same nonsense about creating a new regulator that would simultaneously be less-burdensome than the status quo yet also cement incumbents&#x27; advantages was pitched to the naïve. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the lack of recent precedent because most industries already have existing regulators? A new industry coming into existence isn&#x27;t that common, and when it does happen, I don&#x27;t think this is actually unprecedented. AT&T was one of the big proponents of new regulation back when telephone companies were a recent development.> that would simultaneously be less-burdensome than the status quo yet also cement incumbents&#x27; advantagesBut that&#x27;s classic regulatory capture. The industry gets the government to impose regulations that are wasteful and bureaucratic but can be navigated by a large organization with economies of scale, which allows regulators to appear as if they&#x27;re doing something, but the rules don&#x27;t prevent the incumbents from making a mint by consolidating the industry and charging monopoly rents or avoiding taxes paid by the middle class and smaller competitors etc. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> AT&T was one of the big proponents of new regulation back when telephone companies were a recent developmentAT&T wanted a regulator so it could scale like the railroads. The regulator wasn&#x27;t to regulate AT&T, if I remember correctly, it was to regulate the states. (It backfired in the long run.)Broadly speaking, if you’re weak enough to need a regulator to guard your moat, you’re weak enough to be overpowered by the regulator. Regulatory capture, successful examples, at least, begin from a position of strength.

Now I want to offer WiFi calling plans. There is some domain name in the public DNS where phone numbers are subdomains that resolve to the IP address of its associated phone company so I know where to route calls, and I just go to some free government website to have some numbers routed to me so I can assign them to customers, right? No?> Broadly speaking, if you’re weak enough to need a regulator to guard your moat, you’re weak enough to be overpowered by the regulator.But the strength comes from the moat protected by regulations. The law inhibits competition, so you extract lots of rents from customers, so you have lots of money to influence regulators with. The regulators are the source of your power, but you and the rents you extract are the source of campaign funding, and they don&#x27;t want to cut that off.

To try and upend them by replacing their system of personhood and currency is in effect the tech-bro version of a mutiny. It may seem ridiculous but that&#x27;s precisely what crypto is. An attempt to replace central banks and governments. Tech companies have grown very powerful, and they see an opportunity to create a world-wide \"private government\" and they&#x27;re going for it. This won&#x27;t be the last attempt. Governments will eventually wake up. Or if not.

Do you really think that waiting for all world governments to come together and figure this out is the right move here?I admire the optimism (I think of myself as a pretty optimistic person too), but you&#x27;ve got to realize that there are reasonable people on this planet who think that waiting for governments to fix this is probably not going to turn out well. Some of those people are actually doing something about it, which is what we see here.

There&#x27;s work and death. And if AI truly replaces us, it&#x27;s the latter. I&#x27;m not trying to be cynical I&#x27;m simply being blunt about how systems work.You and your environment have to \"click together\" so you live. In the wild, this means mostly surviving cold, hot, stay dry, find things to eat, and not be eaten.In society, however, it means being useful to the system somehow, so you get access to other useful things the system makes, like air conditioners, housing, and food, ways to get around etc. If you&#x27;re not useful to the system, the system may pretend it cares for you, but it doesn&#x27;t really care for you. This is not up to the morality of the people in charge. It&#x27;s up to the system. The system elects the people and tells them what to care about. The system is quite resilient. It can withstand certain amounts of welfare, corruption, crime, and so on. But only certain amounts. If you cross those certain amounts, what happened in 2020 with COVID handouts, and the subsequent doubling of prices of food, and so on, happens infinitely and suddenly money is worthless paper. Like Zimbabwe. So if you have somewhere else to run where they&#x27;re not as stupid as Zimbabwe, you can be useful in that new place and live. If you have nowhere to run, as with a global UBI, you die.Of course, people won&#x27;t just lay down and die, they&#x27;ll just have a revolution like the Bolsheviks did, and speak about how everything will belong to everyone, and of course resources will concentrate to those on top again, instead. With AI however, the overall trend would be you don&#x27;t need the masses as much, so you don&#x27;t need to placate most of them. They stop being useful. So revolution after revolution, new people will sit on top and promise it&#x27;ll be different this time, in a smaller and smaller population. reply pookha 14 hours agorootparentprevLOL. \"Sam Altman\" is not trying to upend governments.

(as someone, maybe foldingideas, put it: the crypto bros looked at the concentration of wealth in society and decided that the problem was that &#x2F;they&#x2F; weren&#x27;t the ones with all the wealth.)You can just as easily design a crypto scheme to generate tokens and distribute them to everyone with an ID regularly: this is UBI, so long as the tokens have recognized value. The problem is that you need to prevent people from registering a million accounts to get a million UBI credits, deflating the value of tokens held by honest folks. Thus the unique identifier problem. reply tromp 15 hours agorootparent> Bitcoin was designed to act like goldBitcoin&#x27;s emission is quite unlike that of gold.

If you want UBI it&#x27;s going to be through the government, as that&#x27;s the entity collecting the funds through taxes that would be distributed, and they already have a unique identifier for people. In the U.S. it&#x27;s your SSN, which is conveniently also how they track you for income taxes (again, where a large portion of the funds for distribution are gathered)If the government wants to link a retinal scan to a SSN, that might make sense with regard to UBI, but how does it make any sense for some random blockchain? Are we expected to think that even if a government wanted to use a blockchain they would use some third party blockchain and not roll their own? I find that highly unlikely. reply sdenton4 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s &#x27;solved&#x27; in the sense that there&#x27;s a lot of machinery to deal with and remediate fraud and abuse.

If the government has &#x27;solved&#x27; this, why not sell the solution to companies? reply kbenson 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re talking about the market in general, and I&#x27;m talking about with respect to UBI. My thought process is:* Any UBI is going to be government based, as there needs to be a way to collect (tax) and redistribute (UBI) money between all people, whether or not the amount collected and distributed is the same relatively for each or not.* Governments already have (in most cases, if not all. I can&#x27;t speak for every country definitively) ways to uniquely identify their populace. They don&#x27;t need some external service to do such.* Given that UBI will be government based, and the government already has a way to uniquely identify people they govern, what purpose does a third party blockchain to uniquely identify people service with respect to UBI?> It might be helpful to stop and think for a moment about all the cool stuff one could do with a reliable way to link people to accounts uniquely, without fraud.There are plenty of benefits to that. That has nothing to do with UBI. I&#x27;m not making a case that there&#x27;s no benefit to identity verification, just that I&#x27;m not sure how some third party is supposed to help with UBI by providing it.> If the government has &#x27;solved&#x27; this, why not sell the solution to companies?In some small ways (at least for the U.S.) they do. For example, with Tax services to look up people. Additionally, while not provided as a service to companies, SSNs are routinely used to uniquely identify U.S. citizens for financial reasons.The Government could offer more services to companies for this, but there might be perverse incentives involved. Again, none of this has anything to do with UBI from what I can see. Once someone gets money, who cares how it&#x27;s spent? Let it be deposited in the financial institution or asset of their choice. Again, no third party arbiter needs to be present for this, we do this today with tax returns and while different services often help with this, they are both not requires and there&#x27;s multiple to choose from, not one external trusted entity that must be used. reply sdenton4 11 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t starting from the assumption that UBI &#x2F;has&#x2F; to be government-based, and was discussing a core problem (identifiability) that arises when a non-government entity tries to implement UBI. You&#x27;ve just got a different set of assumptions. reply kbenson 11 hours agorootparentOkay, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re wrong assumptions, because I don&#x27;t know how UBI could not be government based, and I haven&#x27;t seen any explanations challenging it.Either it needs to be government based, in which case I think some third party service explaining how they are helping to enable it by providing identifiability is subject to the criticisms I&#x27;ve laid out, or it doesn&#x27;t need to be through the government, in which case I&#x27;m honestly curious as to any explanations from anyone of how that works. reply sdenton4 10 hours agorootparentExpanding the comment here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37037606Cryptocurrency systems proposed ways to handle the creation and management of monetary systems without government involvement. The implementation of such systems is open to definition by the designers of the system, and is extremely fluid. Most cryptocurrencies chose to go with the bitcoin model, which encouraged speculation and early buy-in, but fails like ~waves at the cryptocurrency space in 2023~.So, here you go:Set up a system which creates and destroys tokens programatically. Tokens are created uniformly over all user accounts, and destroyed in each account proportional to the amount already in the account.This handles the wealth-redistribution function of taxation, and allows control of the total number of tokens to prevent inflationary spiraling over time. A prime difficulty is assigning accounts.FWIW, AuroraCoin did &#x2F;something&#x2F; like this in Iceland, using Icelandic identity cards for identifiability, but didn&#x27;t destroy tokens: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;a&#x2F;auroracoin.asp#toc-hist... replykstrauser 16 hours agorootparentprevTo the best of my knowledge, the IRS has never scanned my eyeball, and yet I&#x27;m still able to send and receive money with them.

Photo: Marvel Entertainment Call it the Hollywood-labor-organizing version of Avengers Assemble! On the heels of more than a year’s worth of damning disclosures around Marvel Studios’ systematic overworking and underpayment of visual-effects workers on its blockbuster movies and streaming series, VFX crews at Marvel have finally petitioned to demand union recognition from the studio. On Monday, a group of more than 50 on-set employees filed a petition for an election to be represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) with the National Labor Relations Board. The workers are asking for the election to be held as early as August 21. This marks the first time visual-effects professionals have banded together to demand the same rights, wage protections, and professional watchdog oversight enjoyed by workers in almost every other segment of the entertainment industry. The supermajority of Marvel’s 52-member on-set production crew signed authorization cards to indicate they wish to be represented by the powerful labor union representing some 170,000 artisans, technicians, stagehands, and craftspeople across TV, film, and live theater in the United States and Canada. “For almost half a century, workers in the visual-effects industry have been denied the same protections and benefits their coworkers and crewmates have relied upon since the beginning of the Hollywood film industry,” VFX organizer for IATSE Mark Patch said in a statement. “This is a historic first step for VFX workers coming together with a collective voice demanding respect for what we do.” In an era when around 90 percent of all films in release feature varying degrees of VFX fine-tuning (and it’s not uncommon for a show like Stranger Things to showcase up to 4,400 visual-effects shots across a single season), workers within the field have remained stubbornly, confoundingly unrepresented by any professional union or guild. While fellow below-the-line workers in such divisions as costumes and wardrobe; hair and makeup; lighting, props and paint; and script supervision have been historically championed by IATSE, underappreciated VFX professionals have been unable to claim benefits such as paid overtime and health care, and have been at the mercy of pronounced labor shortages and managers’ unrealistic deadlines — despite the workers’ increasing indispensability within popular culture. “Turnaround times don’t apply to us, protected hours don’t apply to us, and pay equity doesn’t apply to us,” said VFX coordinator Bella Huffman. “Visual effects must become a sustainable and safe department for everyone who’s suffered far too long and for all newcomers who need to know they won’t be exploited.” We are witnessing an unprecedented wave of solidarity that’s breaking down old barriers in the industry and proving we’re all in this fight together. The petition for voluntary union recognition from Marvel and its parent company, Disney, arrives amid what the Los Angeles Times has taken to calling the “hot labor summer”: a cultural inflection point when both the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild are on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, halting productions across Hollywood and throwing the upcoming movie-release corridor into chaos. Just as crucially, however, VFX’s newly strident demands for a seat at the collective-bargaining table also play out against a backdrop of increasing fan displeasure with (and critical opprobrium toward) the quality of computer-generated imagery in Marvel Studios movies and series, coming perhaps not coincidentally just months after the firing of Marvel’s president of postproduction and VFX, Victoria Alonso. Even with the group’s NLRB petition, a VFX workers strike is not out of the question; it is perhaps the most battle-tested and surefire route to union recognition. (Representatives at Disney and Marvel did not respond to requests for comment from Vulture.) Leading off the collective-bargaining push with Marvel’s on-set VFX specialists — data wranglers, production managers, witness camera operators, and assistants employed on such MCU series as Loki and Daredevil: Born Again, as opposed to the people supplying visual effects in postproduction — arrives as no accident. Thanks to the studio’s fire hose of movie and TV series output (it will oversee the release of five movies and four shows in 2023 alone), Marvel is regarded in VFX circles as the industry’s biggest “bully,” with the capacity to flood effects houses with more work than they know what to do with or ruin careers and standings of those who do not live up to Marvel’s sky-high expectations. Hence, as the thinking goes, securing union recognition for a relatively small yet high-profile group of Marvel’s so-called “production-side” professionals would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push. Production-side unity would lead to solidarity at postproduction houses, which would then, in turn, unionize one by one, leading to an inevitable tipping point. The template for this sort of thing was set in the animation world last February when production workers for Adult Swim’s Rick & Morty and Hulu’s Solar Opposites filed a petition with the NLRB for a union election, sparking a new wave of unionization for workers throughout the animation industry by becoming the first to be represented by the IATSE-affiliated Animation Guild. Soon after, workers at the Los Angeles branch of the award-winning production house Titmouse joined the guild to begin collective bargaining for their first union contract. And those efforts ultimately compelled a coalition of production workers on the shows American Dad, Family Guy, and The Simpsons to also unionize under the Animation Guild, teeing up new collective-bargaining negotiations for increased benefits with 20th Television Animation last summer. “We are witnessing an unprecedented wave of solidarity that’s breaking down old barriers in the industry and proving we’re all in this fight together,” said IATSE International president Matthew D. Loeb. “That doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Entertainment workers everywhere are sticking up for each other’s rights; that’s what our movement is all about. I congratulate these workers on taking this important step and using their collective voice. I urge Marvel Studios to voluntarily recognize their union immediately.” RELATED I’m a VFX Artist, and I’m Tired of Getting ‘Pixel-F–ked’ by Marvel TAGS: MOVIES MARVEL DISNEY VFX IATSE IATSE STRIKE MORE SHOW 8 COMMENTS MOST VIEWED STORIES Overworked and Underpaid, VFX Workers Vote to Unionize at Marvel Taylor Swift Sang ‘Death by a Thousand Cuts’ for the Writer who Inspired It The Real Housewives of New York City Recap: Brynn Is Giving The Real Housewives of Atlanta Recap: The Ghost of Nene Leakes The Highs, Lows, and Whoas of Lollapalooza 2023 LATEST NEWS FROM VULTURE OVERNIGHTS 3:00 A.M.

This is in contrast with other people in movies who get paid per day of labor when shooting the film. So the director has an incentive to make the shooting of the film as efficient as possible and then they just \"fix it in post\" because there is no marginal cost to them to cram more work onto the VFX shop.In theory, the union will probably get the VFX people fair wages. In practice, I&#x27;m betting that studios will invest heavily into generative AI. Either way, the recent Hollywood union actions will end the exploration of VFX professionals. reply ClimaxGravely 9 hours agoparentI&#x27;m not well versed in the business side of things so I want to ask : Isn&#x27;t fixed cost contracts considered usually a bad idea in creative-technical endeavors?I spent about 10 years or so working in AAA games and I found that I had to work in a way that was essentially anticipating major changes. Essentially a totally different approach to programming compared to the other programming jobs I&#x27;ve had (robotics&#x2F;finance&#x2F;academic).Many games I&#x27;ve worked on, the shipped product is completely different from the initial prototype that was sold.My understanding was generally you get into a contract with a publisher and have a payment schedule every N months. At each checkpoint the publisher can assess whether they want to continue with the contract or let it go.I can&#x27;t imagine this kind of project ever working with a fixed-cost contract. Extreme change is the norm when you have creatives at the helm of the project. reply rperez333 5 hours agorootparentScott Ross, founder and former CEO of Digital Domain, spoke for years about this. The issue is there are just a handful of film studios capable of keeping a large VFX facility busy, so they have a lot of leverage when negotiating contracts and setting prices.Because that part of the film process can run offshore, VFX studios find themselves fighting for these contracts and&#x2F;or accepting unadvantegeous terms. I remember him saying that film studios can strong arm a VFX facility to open in a place under heavy tax breaks, and they are expected to &#x27;forward&#x27; the cost savings.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;66487005 reply ClimaxGravely 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the info.

I doubt the settlement had a clause that said \"you can&#x27;t start a union\".Why wouldn&#x27;t it have one? I&#x27;m sure the lawyers involved here wouldn&#x27;t miss the obvious question. Seems like a sound way to make the issue go away for a while: pay the instigators a bunch of money with the stipulation that they not continue to instigate.Nothing stops other people from trying again, but buying out the ones in charge of the effort goes a long way towards setting it back. Plus, by settling out of court, the company avoids the risk that the court decide its behavior was illegal. The courts may do so in the future, but it would take getting caught again. In the meantime, the company can refine its methods of limiting unionization while better avoiding obviously illegal behavior.Most of that is contingent on setting existing unionization efforts back, to buy time for efforts to be mobilized or improved. The easiest way to set any social movement back is to eliminate key points of coordination.

For consulting mostly this is handled by scoping as tightly as possible and then issuing change requests for out of scope requirements that are billed. I guess hard with a films fixed budget though. reply yafbum 9 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve root caused this yet. There are other areas where studios do not&#x2F; cannot behave this way. Take something like electricity or catering, both of which are typically critical to production (even if unglamorous). No electricity company is going to let studios pay on a flat fee basis no matter how much they draw from the grid. No catering company is going to bid on a fixed cost basis letting the studio double the number of days that they have to feed people. So why is it that VFX companies keep bidding themselves into trouble with overstretched goals?IMO this is an industry with chronically over-optimistic bidding practices, fueled by a consistent influx of wannabe low-cost entrants motivated by the \"cool factor\" of working for the movies. If you have other insights, very curious to know. reply cududa 9 hours agorootparentThe reason people usually only work at VFX companies for 9-16 months is because they have to underbid, bidding higher means no contracts, lays them off, then another studio springs up that them and their coworkers all go to and the cycle repeats.Somebody is always going to bid lower, go bankrupt&#x2F; skeleton crew, and another studio springs up with idealism that there’s will be different. reply yafbum 6 hours agorootparentWhy do they have to underbid?

They still have to employ someone to use generative AI (and other tools, it can&#x27;t do everything yet), and that person is a VFX artist. The whole \"It&#x27;s just a tool\" thing isn&#x27;t a joke or a rhetorical device, it is literally true: this software needs to be used by someone who is trained in how to use it to get good results on a commercial level, and for the products we&#x27;re talking about (Marvel movies) they are also going to need to be proficient in the rest of the VFX skillset as well. Generative AI replacing VFX workers entirely is a fantasy until the point where a company can hire&#x2F;rent&#x2F;buy&#x2F;build a whole AI system (or company of such systems) which are plug-in replacements for human workers that are working remote. In case it&#x27;s unclear what that means, that is human level intelligence. It then needs to be cheaper to pay for the computation that system requires than it would be to pay a human for an equivalent amount of work. I&#x27;m not saying that will never happen, it probably will, but it is definitely not the case with current generative AI tech and it&#x27;s not on a reasonable five year time horizon.The major impact generative AI tech will have on VFX is that because VFX workers who known how to use it well will produce significantly more or significantly higher quality output than those who don&#x27;t, the bar is going to be raised significantly for how much work VFX houses are expected to produce. Given that, this is a pretty normal time to try and unionise, because with anticipated productivity windfalls the working class and the owning class are going to fight over who gets how much of those productivity windfalls. It&#x27;s a possibility that less VFX workers get employed overall as a result of higher productivity, but I really doubt it. We have seen this story play out in VFX for decades: as tools get better and enable higher productivity, demand rises and more people are employed (still in shitty conditions though). You can also see it in the games industry, often with the same technology: did generative technology for tree asset production cause job losses in the games industry? No, it just dramatically increased the number of games (and films) that could have large numbers of realistic modelled trees, back in 2009. Since then demand for games and films has only increased and so have job numbers in both industries.Current generative AI tech, when applied in VFX&#x2F;games asset creation and post-production is basically a better version of SpeedTree for a wider variety of assets. It is likely to have similar economic effects to what SpeedTree did, which is to say higher productivity in cases where you can use it and higher achievement peaks in the the films and games produced. It shouldn&#x27;t fix poor job conditions and it shouldn&#x27;t make them worse in an objective sense. What will determine job conditions is union action or lack thereof, so it&#x27;s good to see VFX workers doing their best to unionise right now. reply creddit 10 hours agoparentprevGenAI will just mean fewer VFX workers but should also mean better wages for them. reply nicup12345689 10 hours agorootparentNot necessarily, less leverage, more profit goes to capital rather than labor. reply creddit 10 hours agorootparentWhy is there less leverage? reply frankbreetz 10 hours agorootparentLess jobs, mean same number of people fighting for same positions.

I expect better wages, but neither assume it nor guarantee it.I did however state that I expect fewer workers in the space. This isn’t entirely clear either but I will go on the record to state that I expect it. It’s possible that the GenAI tools will enable such productivity increases that we see a surge in induced demand and a massive influx of content. My expectation is that this won’t happen as I believe we are likely close to a saturation point in content and expect then that the productivity increases will drown out any induced demand yielding fewer workers. reply nextaccountic 9 hours agorootparent> I expect better wagesWhy? reply User23 10 hours agorootparentprevIt used to until about 1965.

Every state (and many major cities) with any exposure to the movie industry have tax incentives that subsidize this industry. I did a quick search on News.Google for articles about VFX and tax incentives -- dozens of articles per year discussing where the new tax incentives are and which countries feared losing their foothold in the industry because their tax incentives were not racing to the bottom quick enough.Also, the bidding per scene is difficult for VFX houses and their employees as scenes are qualitatively (and quantitatively) different. The VFX houses want to continue to get business from the studios, so they put all of the pressure on the artists without pushing back on requirements from the studios.I&#x27;m curious if there is jurisdiction triage in a contract like this (where the studio is in a state which may be bound by strong union laws, but the contracted VFX houses may be in states that do not enforce union laws&#x2F;contracts).

Take software for example, where folks routinely make bananas money for regular work. In those environments, unions typically protect unproductive peers, and limit high-performer&#x27;s maximum compensation.Union does not always mean better...As an aside, people do need to learn to say no to work. Just because you want to work on say, video games or VFX doesn&#x27;t mean you should accept a job that compels you to work horrendous hours for little pay.

I worked on a still-running and popular MMO, shipped another popular and still-running MMO, and now work for a popular game tooling company. I do primarily systems work in the DevOps sphere.I’m underpaid. My hours aren’t great. I also find it pretty difficult to find a new job. Why? I’m pretty good at my job most of the time (I’ve spoken at tech and hacker conferences, built a lot of “first ever” things, led teams, that sort of thing) but a lot of CICD work and building pipelines is “sysadmin first, programmer distant second” type of work that requires knowing the ecosystem and how all the various pieces and priorities from hardware limitations all the way through to customer deliverables works. That is to say I do a lot of Bash, Ansible, Salt, Puppet, Terraform, GH Actions, Jenkins, all that stuff, not rip out Go for a living. Guess what a bunch of tech companies require you to do live in an interview now? And, shock upon shocks, it gets you people who do my job poorly and burn out.Whenever we’ve onboarded a new engineer it takes about six months before they even BEGIN to be able to contribute meaningfully and we EXPECT them to be around for the long haul. If you’re doing something that’s easy to onboard a DevOps person onto then someone else has already done it for you, typically better than you can. That’s kind of the point.So why stay in games? I’ve previously worked for non-profits, governments, militaries…and I hated it. I was still very good at what I did and I hated every second of it. No amount of monster slaying ever makes the world better, people just keep inventing new monsters. I couldn’t do it anymore as I don’t want my legacy to be a lot of highly durable, flexible, and simple-to-run systems used for violence and oppression. My work, directly, put a lot of (admittedly TERRIBLE) people in prison.But games, up until recently anyway, are something different. I love games, always have. I love building them, playing them, buying them, sending them to people, helping make them, being around them, hearing about how they change people’s lives. I adore them. They helped me stay alive. They saved friends and even myself from suicide. They got us through the pandemic. They gave me and so many people GOOD experiences that make the world undeniably BETTER. I’ve had Make-A-Wish kids come into my old studio before because even facing down terminal illness every single day they wanted NOTHING more than to meet the people that made them happy. I DID that.I can do this job. I can wake up in the morning and feel my work is GOOD and makes the world BETTER, safer, HAPPIER because people can build, play, and share games. Nothing any of my friends making triple my salary will EVER do at their jobs will ever exceed that level of public good. When’s the last time you heard someone doing GOOD at Oracle? When’s the last time you talked to a teenager who wanted to make a game and made it POSSIBLE? I do that every single day.It’s not about the money. Give me a decent, reliable paycheck, a flexible schedule, remote work, and a mission and I will BUILD THE SHIT out of whatever you need automated. Games are the only way I’ve been able to live with myself when I stopped needing to survive and needed to start finding out how to live. It’s not just a dream, it’s LIFE SUPPORT for me.And now that industry, too, has no more bright spots outside of tiny indie studios. I cannot describe how much that hurts me personally. Now it really is just awful corps the whole way down, just like every other big tech industry player.Why stay? Where can I GO? To do what? Make some awful rich people even more rich? Doesn’t matter how much I open source, doesn’t matter how many talks I give, doesn’t matter what tools I make and give away, none of it will ever save the only thing that made my work worthwhile in the face of a depressing sinkhole of greed.So yeah, I can’t speak for everyone but I can speak as a vet for quite a few years. reply pierrefermat1 8 hours agorootparentGiven your experience in DevOps it seems that you could go work for any sort of small-mid scale software startup that is remote only and earn a pretty decent living.Do just have a look at the who&#x27;s hiring posts that are posted at the beginning of the month here. reply kian 5 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a method you&#x27;d feel comfortable with me contacting you via? reply yafbum 9 hours agoprevThis looks like a very very small development concerning only 50 workers at one shop.

Unions are how workers tell companies \"You think your bottom line is bad, watch what happens when nobody is keeping the gears turning\". It&#x27;s a financial threat to keep employees well paid. And that&#x27;s the only lingo companies speak. There&#x27;s a reason big corporations spend so much money union busting.

It's delivered as a single, stateless Go binary so there are no local disks to manage, no brokers to rebalance, and no ZooKeeper to operate. WarpStream is 5-10x cheaper than Kafka in the cloud because data streams directly to and from S3 instead of using inter-zone networking, which can be over 80% of the infrastructure cost of a Kafka deployment at scale. If you just want to get your hands dirty, you can try our demo in under 30s. $ curl https://console.warpstream.com/install.shbash $ warpstream demo Otherwise, read on! Kafka is Dead, Long Live Kafka Chances are you probably had a strong reaction to the title of this post. In our experience, Kafka is one of the most polarizing technologies in the data space. Some people hate it, some people swear by it, but almost every technology company uses it. Kafka was first open sourced in 2011, and quickly became the default infrastructure for building streaming architectures. Jay Kreps' now well-known The Log blog post is still one of my favorite blog posts ever because it walks through why the distributed log abstraction that Kafka provides is so powerful. But it’s not 2011 anymore. A lot has changed about how we build modern software, primarily a major shift towards cloud environments, and yet Kafka has remained more or the less the same. Many organizations have managed to “lift and shift” Kafka into their cloud environments, but let’s be honest, nobody is really happy with the result. Kafka is expensive, finicky, and difficult to run for most organizations who use it. Kafka itself is not the problem. It’s a great piece of software that was well suited for the environment it was created for: LinkedIn’s data centers in 2011. However, it is an unusually poor fit for modern workloads for two reasons: Cloud economics – by design, Kafka’s replication strategy will rack up massive inter AZ bandwidth costs. Operational overhead – running your own Kafka cluster literally requires a dedicated team and sophisticated custom tooling. We're going to pick on Kafka for the rest of this post, but keep in mind that everything we're saying about Kafka applies equally to any similar system that stores data on locals disks (however briefly), regardless of which programming language its implemented in. Kafka-nomics The diagram below depicts a typical 3 availability zone Kafka cluster:  Every GiB of data that is produced must be written cross zone 2/3rds of the time1, and subsequently replicated by the partition leader to the followers in the other two zones for durability and availability reasons. Every time a GiB of data is transferred across zones, it costs $0.022, $0.01 for egress in the source zone and $0.01 for ingress in the destination zone. $0.01*⅔ + $0.02 *2 == $0.053 for every GiB of data that you stream through your Kafka cluster in the best case scenario3. The cost of storing a GiB of data in S3 for a month is only $0.0214, so for the same price as copying data from a producer to a consumer via Kafka, you could store that data in S3 for over two months. In practice, for any Kafka cluster with substantial throughput, the hardware costs are negligible since 70-90% of the cost of the workload is just inter-zone bandwidth fees. Confluent has a good write up about this problem as well. It’s important to stress that this inter-AZ bandwidth problem is fundamental to how Kafka works. Kafka was designed to run in LinkedIn’s data centers, where the network engineers didn’t charge their application developers for moving data around. But today, most Kafka users are running it on a public cloud, an environment with completely different constraints and cost models. Unfortunately, unless your organization can commit to 10s or 100s of millions of dollars per year in cloud spend, there is no escaping the physics of this problem. It’s not just a question of throughput either, even a low throughput Kafka cluster with long retention can have large storage requirements. In this case, Kafka’s approach of triply replicating the data on expensive local SSDs costs roughly 10-20x more5 per GiB than using object storage like S3 assuming the best case scenario of 100% disk utilization. Accidental SRE Most developers first encounter Kafka because they have a real problem they want to solve. However, before they can begin solving their problems, they must first learn about: Kafka (brokers, coordinators, watermarks, etc) ZooKeeper (or KRaft) Leader elections Partitions (how many partitions do I need? Unclear, but better get it right because you can never change it!) Consumer groups Rebalancing Broker tuning Client tuning etc Kafka’s “data plane” (brokers) and consensus-based “control plane” (controllers, ZooKeeper, etc) all run directly on local SSDs that must be managed with expertise and care. In practice, self-hosted Kafka clusters require a dedicated team of experts and significant amounts of custom tooling before even basic operations like node replacements and scaling clusters can be performed safely and reliably. For example, the Apache Kafka built in partition reassignment tool cannot even generate plans for decommissioning brokers when you (inevitably) experience a hardware failure: The partition reassignment tool does not have the ability to automatically generate a reassignment plan for decommissioning brokers yet. As such, the admin has to come up with a reassignment plan to move the replica for all partitions hosted on the broker to be decommissioned, to the rest of the brokers. This can be relatively tedious as the reassignment needs to ensure that all the replicas are not moved from the decommissioned broker to only one other broker. In many cases, offloading cluster management to a hosted provider like AWS MSK doesn’t even solve the operational burden problem. For example, the MSK documentation on how to rebalance a cluster (a very routine operation) just links to the Apache Kafka documentation which involves hand-editing JSON to specify which partitions should be migrated to which brokers and includes helpful commentary like: The partition reassignment tool does not have the capability to automatically study the data distribution in a Kafka cluster and move partitions around to attain an even load distribution. As such, the admin has to figure out which topics or partitions should be moved around. There are open source solutions like Cruise Control that can help ease this burden, but that is yet another set of concepts that need to learned, services that need to deployed and monitored, and sharp edges that need to be encountered. Cruise Control itself is a JVM application that depends on both Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper. Hardly a lightweight solution. Unfortunately, in many cases developers set out to solve a business problem, and end up becoming Kafka SREs instead. S3 Is All You Need The high costs of using Kafka (both in dollars and engineering hours) means that today businesses can only afford to use it for their most high value use-cases like fraud detection and CDC. The cost of entry is simply too high for anything else. When we were at Datadog, we built Husky, a columnar database purpose-built for observability data that ran directly on top of S3. When we were done, we had a (mostly) stateless and auto scaling data lake that was extremely cost effective, never ran out of disk space, and was trivial to operate. Almost overnight our Kafka clusters suddenly looked ancient by comparison. Kafka bandwidth volumes at Datadog were measured in double-digit GiB/s and broker storage was measured in PiB’s of NVMEs6. Maintaining this level of infrastructure using open source Kafka, custom tooling, and bare VMs was no small feat. Luckily the responsible engineering teams at Datadog were extremely capable and made it work, but even after many years of investment, the automation simply couldn’t compete with the millions of engineering hours that have gone into making systems like S3 extremely robust, scalable, cost effective, and elastic. In general, large storage workloads running in cloud environments stand no chance of competing with the economics, reliability, scalability, and elasticity of object storage. This is why “big data” technologies like Snowflake and Databricks don’t even try. Instead, they lean into cloud economics by designing their systems from the ground up around commodity object storage. Companies like Uber, Datadog, and many others have made Kafka work for them despite all of its flaws. But there are so many interesting problems that will never get solved if the existing Kafka implementation remains the barrier to entry. That’s why we care about this space, and that’s why we set out to build something that would make data streaming infrastructure as accessible as S3. If we could build a Kafka-like system directly on top of S3, that would solve two of the major problems with Kafka in one fell swoop; costs would be massively reduced, and most traditional Kafka operational headaches would disappear overnight. No major cloud provider charges for networking costs between VMs and object storage, and AWS employs literally hundreds of engineers whose only job is to make sure that S3 runs reliably and scales infinitely, so you don’t have to. Of course, that’s easier said than done, and there is a good reason no one has done it yet: figuring out how to build low latency streaming infrastructure on-top of a high latency storage medium like S3, while still providing the full semantics of the Kafka protocol, without introducing any local disks, is a very tricky problem! So we asked ourselves: “What would Kafka look like if it was redesigned from the ground up today to run in modern cloud environments, directly on top of object storage, with no local disks to manage, but still had to support the existing Kafka protocol?” WarpStream is our answer to that question. Introducing WarpStream WarpStream is a Kafka protocol compatible data streaming platform that runs directly on top of any commodity object store (AWS S3, GCP GCS, Azure Blob Storage, etc). It incurs zero inter-AZ bandwidth costs, has no local disks to manage, and can run completely within your VPC. That’s a lot to digest, so let’s unpack it by comparing WarpStream’s architecture to Kafka’s: Instead of Kafka brokers, WarpStream has “Agents”. Agents are stateless Go binaries (no JVM!) that speak the Kafka protocol, but unlike a traditional Kafka broker, any WarpStream Agent can act as the “leader” for any topic, commit offsets for any consumer group, or act as the coordinator for the cluster. No Agent is special, so auto-scaling them based on CPU-usage or network bandwidth is trivial. How did we accomplish this if Apache Kafka requires running Apache ZooKeeper (or KRaft) and a bunch of stateful brokers with local SSDs and replication? We separated storage and compute (by offloading data to S3) We separated data from metadata (by offloading metadata to a custom metadata store) Offloading all storage to object storage like S3 allows users to trivially scale the number of WarpStream Agents in response to changes in load with zero data rebalancing. It also enables faster recovery from failures because any request can be retried on another Agent immediately. It also mostly eliminates hotspots, where some Kafka brokers would have dramatically higher load than others due to uneven amounts of data in each partition. That means you can say goodbye to manually rebalancing partitions, and don't need to learn about complex solutions like Cruise Control. The other pillar of WarpStream's design is separating data from metadata, just like a modern data lake does. We store the metadata for every WarpStream “Virtual Cluster” in a custom metadata database that was written from the ground up to solve this exact problem in the most performant and cost effective way possible. In fact, we’re so confident in the efficiency of our metadata store, we’ll host WarpStream Virtual Clusters for you for free. You can read more about WarpStream’s architecture in our documentation, but to summarize: WarpStream offloads all of the hard problems of data replication, durability, and availability to an object storage bucket so you never have to think about it, but all of your data stays inside your cloud account. The only data that ever leaves your cloud account with WarpStream is the workload metadata that is required for consensus, like the order of the batches in your partitions. Modern practitioners who want to introduce large scale data streaming pipelines into their infrastructure today don’t have many good choices. They either have to spend a lot of money and create an entire dedicated team of engineers whose only job is to operate Kafka, or they have to pay a vendor for a hosted solution and spend even more money, making many of their streaming use-cases economically infeasible. We think WarpStream can provide a better option that leverages the cloud as a strength instead of a weakness, and unlocks a whole new set of possibilities in the data streaming world. You don’t just have to take our word for it though, we brought receipts! The image below shows the interzone networking costs of our entire cloud account (measured using the excellent vantage.sh), including the continuous streaming workload we run in our test environment. This workload continuously produces 140MiB/s of data and consumes it with three dedicated consumers for a total of 560MiB/s in continuous data transfer. You can see that we average < $15/day in interzone networking fees, whereas the exact same workload run using a Kafka cluster would cost 0.14GiB * $0.053/GiB * 60 * 60 * 24 == $641 per day in interzone networking fees alone. We didn’t just replace these interzone networking costs with hardware or S3 API costs either. This same workload costs < $40/day in S3 API operation costs: It also only requires 27 vCPUs worth of Agent hardware / VMs. In terms of total cost of ownership, WarpStream will reduce the cost of most Kafka workloads by 5-10x. For example, here is a comparison of the cost of running a sustained 1GiB/s Kafka workload vs the equivalent using WarpStream: Footnote 7 for self hosted Kafka hardware costs, footnote 8 for self hosted Kafka network costs. Note that this table assumes the best case scenario that the Kafka cluster is properly configured to use the follower fetch functionality to reduce interzone networking costs for consumers. If it’s not, the Kafka costs would be much higher. It also omits the cost of engineering salaries for the self hosted Kafka setup. The table above demonstrates clearly that for high volume Kafka workloads, the hardware costs are negligible because the cost of the workload is dominated by inter-zone networking fees. WarpStream eliminates those networking fees entirely. Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Engineering is about trade-offs, and we’ve made a significant one with WarpStream: latency. The current implementation has a P99 of ~400ms for Produce requests because we never acknowledge data until it has been durably persisted in S3 and committed to our cloud control plane. In addition, our current P99 latency of data end-to-end from producer-to-consumer is around 1s: If your workload can tolerate a P99 of ~1s of producer-to-consumer latency, then WarpStream can reduce your total data streaming costs by 5-10x per GiB, with almost zero operational overhead. We don’t have a proprietary interface either; it’s just Kafka, so there is no vendor lock in. Finally, WarpStream runs in any environment with an object store implementation, so we can meet you where you’re at with S3 in AWS, GCS in GCP, and Azure Blob Storage in Azure. If you’ve made it this far, you may have noticed that WarpStream mainly addresses two of the major problems with Kafka: cloud economics and operational overhead. We think that there is a third major problem with Kafka: developer UX. In our view, partitions are way too low level of an abstraction to program against for writing any non-trivial stream processing application, and we think that WarpStream’s architecture puts us in a unique position to help developers write stream processing applications in a novel way that’s much closer to how they’re used to writing traditional applications. We’ll talk about that more in a future blog post, but the first thing we wanted to do is meet developers where they are and offer them an improved version of a tool they’re already familiar with. WarpStream is currently in developer preview. That means you can sign up in a completely self-serve manner, and follow our documentation to start playing around with it. You can run WarpStream yourself locally on your laptop, or you can even deploy it to your staging environment.

Don’t know, don’t care, don’t have two spare weeks to spend figuring it out). Note that we have proper liveness checks on individual instances, so the issue is more complicated than that.Migrated to 3.3 with KRaft about half a year ago, and we haven’t had a single issue since.

They&#x27;d chug along just fine for a bit, seemingly handling outages that e.g. RDS would have thrown a fit over, and then suddenly they&#x27;d be cataclysmically down in extremely complicated ways and be very difficult to bring back up. Even just using them required teaching a more complex mental model than most cloud-hosted offerings of similar things, and you ended up in this path dependency trap of \"we already invested so much in Kafka, so if you want to send a message, use Kafka\" when for like 95+% of use cases something easy like SQS would&#x27;ve been fine and simpler.

Moving off it is a mistake, IMO.I’m agnostic about Kafka but ZooKeeper is problematic for many use cases based on personal experience and I wouldn’t recommend it. It can be “rock solid” and still not very good. I’ve seen ZK replaced with alternatives at a few different organizations now because it didn’t work well in practice, and what it was replaced with worked much better in every case.ZooKeeper works, sort of, but I wouldn’t call it “good” in some objective sense. reply dikei 3 hours agorootparentTo be fair, a lot of people use ZK wrong, then complaint about it.For example, if you use it like a general purpose KV store like Redis, you&#x27;ll have a bad time.Another often encountered mistake is people, thinking it doesn&#x27;t need to store much data, deploy ZK to a server with slow disk&#x2F;network. Big mistake, as every write to ZK need to be broadcasted and synced to disk, a bottle-neck in disk and network IOPS will kill your ensembles. reply richieartoul 14 hours agorootparentprev(WarpStream co-founder)I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. Message persistence is a fundamental feature of Kafka that almost everyone using it relies on, its not some esoteric feature no one uses. We&#x27;re each coming from our own network bias here, but in my experience a lot of people are really unhappy with the operational toil associated with running Kafka at scale in production. reply benjaminwootton 6 hours agorootparentYes it’s fundamental, but it’s not generally that significant to users of Kafka.As a developer, Kafka is a place to publish and subscribe to data with reliability and performance.As a developer, the fact that messages are persistent is nothing more than a cool feature in that I can replay messages if I need to.Things like consumer groups and offsets are features of the API, but they aren’t complex. Every similar tool whether it be RabbitMQ or IBM MQ has its own API abstractions and features. Likewise, I need to learn about failover semantics, but that’s the same with any API dependency.It seems that you and the other posters here have a concensus that it’s hard to operate. Rather than saying that Kafka is dead or a polarising technology, a better line of argument is that it’s simply hard or expensive to operate at scale. (I personally think that’s par for the course with a technology like this, but that’s an aside.)You have to remember that for everyone operating Kafka, there will be on average tens or hundreds of developers using it. And the vast, vast majority of those will not find it to be particularly polarising. Instead, they’ll find it a de-facto choice. reply twelve40 8 hours agorootparentprevi work at a place that has a whole devops department maintaining it (so not even my pain), and i still hate how overengineered the overall system ended up, it&#x27;s more busywork programming for it, debugging it, etc. No reason not to use sqs or rabbit or whatever unless you have a very special use case, or begin to hit X messages&#x2F;second.

Unless you&#x27;re doing insane volumes in single clusters, most of the pieces around it can work OK on default mode for a surprisingly long time.You can cost footgun yourself like the blog here talks about with cross-AZ stuff (but that doesn&#x27;t feel like the right level to do that at for me for most cases anyway), and anytime you&#x27;re doing events or streaming data at all you&#x27;re gonna run into some really interesting semantic problems compared to traditional services (but also new capacities that are rarely even attempted in that world, like replaying failed messages from hours ago), so it&#x27;s good to know exactly what you&#x27;re getting into, but I&#x27;ve spent far less time fighting ZK than Kafka and far less time fighting either than getting the application semantics right.I imagine a lot of pain comes from \"I want events, I know nothing about events, I don&#x27;t know how to select a tool, now I&#x27;m learning both the tool and the semantics of events and queues both on the fly and making painful decisions along the way\" which I&#x27;ve seen several places (and helped avoid in some of the later places after learning some hard, not-well-discussed-online lessons). I think the space just lets you do so many more things, so figuring out what&#x27;s best for YOU is way more difficult the first time you as traditional-backend-online-service-developer start asking questions like \"but what if we reprocess the stuff that we otherwise would&#x27;ve just black-hole-500&#x27;d during that outage after all\" and then have to deal with things like ordering and time in all its glory. reply AtlasBarfed 9 hours agorootparentprev1) scala&#x2F;java ... is that fundamentally difficult?2) zookeeper is being eliminated as a dependenct from kafka3) durable disk management ...

Well, sorry, those systems are hard. I get this a lot for Cassandra.You either have the stones for it as a technical org to run software like that, or you pay SAAS overhead for it.

There are certainly better options if you just want a MQ, especially if you want to support MQ patterns like fanout.The reality is if you&#x27;re doingand every time it has been a solution in search of a problem.More refined to this, in my experience at the last two jobs, the queue problem is there, but the Kafka solution is based solely on \"enterpriseyness\" of Kafka, not any practical reason. RabbitMQ is highly performant, SQS is really easy. Both are great queues. Kafka is muuch more, yet, Kafka is chosen because \"it&#x27;s enterprise.\" reply relay23 11 hours agorootparentMaybe \"it&#x27;s enterprise\" means that&#x27;s what the enterprise standardized on. There are a couple of practical reasons that come to mind on why that&#x27;s the case - a) it&#x27;s more resilient and durable than messaging platforms, and b) it is a platform of dumb pipes, so to make it a central data bus managed by platform teams means that they don&#x27;t have to get into the detail of which queues perform what functions, have what characteristics, etc. Rather the client teams in the various business units can take care of all of their \"smarts\" the way they want. It also handles log&#x2F;telemetry ingestion, data platform integration, and interservice comms use cases which is pretty multi-functional. That&#x27;s the primary reason why Kafka has become such a pervasive and common platform, it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s trendy, in fact most operations teams would rather not even have to operate the kafka platform. reply EdwardDiego 12 hours agorootparentprevKafka isn&#x27;t even a queue.

The words tell me nothing, just like any other tech&#x2F;software that is described as \"powerful\".In my last two major gigs, RabbitMQ was already being run in a clustered config, and it was not going well. Both places were in the process of doing arch changes to do a change to Kafka.It seems like something that works great in a big scaled node and you can go to big nodes these days, but I don&#x27;t think it is ready for cloud&#x2F;distributed durability.I&#x27;m not aware of Jepsen testing of RabbitMQ in distributed mode for example, and I wouldn&#x27;t consider any distributed&#x2F;clustered product that hasn&#x27;t let Jepsen embarass it yet.Cassandra and Kafka are frequent examples of YAGNI overengineering (although the fault tolerance can be nice without scale), the reality is that pumping up single-node solutions for too long is a big trap. Projects that start to stress single-nodes (I&#x27;m thinking like a 4xlarge anything on aws) should probably get to thinking about the need for jumping to dynamodb&#x2F;cassandra&#x2F;bigtable&#x2F;kafka&#x2F;etc.RabbitMQ --> Kafka is a pretty easy lift if your messaging has good abstractions.relational DB --> Cassandra is a lot bigger headache because of the lack of joins. reply kfk 15 hours agorootparentprevThe biggest issue for me is people using kafka for mqtt, mqtt is a pub&#x2F;sub broker already.

I certainly think it&#x27;s possible people might be looking to fit Kafka into things that simply don&#x27;t need it (perhaps driven by the system design theory focus in hiring), but for the applications where you have event streaming, Kafka is still the top choice. Analytics, messaging, sensors, etc.From my side, I agree with the author about the \"Accidental SRE\" points. But Kafka is a solid technology, so much so that there&#x27;s no shortage of \"Kafka but better\" tools out there (e.g. Redpanda).Also you kind of drift off the point there at the end - even if it wasn&#x27;t used extensively (a point of contention), that has nothing to do with whether it is polarizing or not? The statement about it being loved or hated is still relevant to those solving the 1% scaling problems you mentioned, even if 99% aren&#x27;t.It&#x27;s like saying that the statement \"lamborghinis are polarizing\" is false because most of us don&#x27;t have one?

And I think most serious companies doing that have a need for highly available data storage, for which Kafka is the least bad option.What are the alternatives? Cassandra is just as operationally complex and harder to fit your dataflow into. The various efforts to built proper master-master HA on MySQL or PostgreSQL or similar tend to be flaky, expensive, and vendor-lockined. BigTable can work if you&#x27;re all-in on Google Cloud, but that&#x27;s quite a risk.As far as I can tell there are mostly companies that use Kafka and companies that have a SPOF PostgreSQL&#x2F;MySQL database (with some read replicas, and maybe some untested perl scripts that are supposed to be able to promote a replica to master) and stick their fingers in their ears. reply fulafel 4 hours agorootparentI think if you dismiss HA setups of SQL dbs as \"you won&#x27;t get around to operating it properly\" the same ops culture will also end up getting many less 9&#x27;s availability than aspired to with Kafka.(But also of course lots of applications are also fine with the availability that you get from fate-sharing with a single db server) reply lmm 3 hours agorootparent> I think if you dismiss HA setups of SQL dbs as \"you won&#x27;t get around to operating it properly\" the same ops culture will also end up getting many less 9&#x27;s availability than aspired to with Kafka.Up to a point. IME Kafka is a lot easier to operate in true HA form than SQL dbs, and a lot more commonly operated that way; Kafka has a reputation for being harder to operate than a typical datastore, but that&#x27;s usually comparing a HA Kafka setup with a single-node SQL db.

ClickHouse is surprisingly easy to deploy and setup, talks both mysql and postgresql wire protocols (so you can query stuff with your existing relational tools), the query language is SQL (including joins with external data sources, such as S3 files, external relational databases and other clickhouse tables), and it is ACID on specific operations. It assumes your dataset is (mostly) append-only, and inserts work well when done in batch. It is also blazingly fast, and very compact when using the MergeTree family of storage engines.Development is very active, and some features are experimental. One of the common mistakes is to use latest releases for production environments - you will certainly find odd bugs on specific usage scenarios. Stay away from the bleeding edge and you&#x27;re fine. Clustering (table replication and sharding of queries) is also a sort-of can of worms by itself, and requires good knowledge of your workload and your data structure to understand all the tradeoffs. Thing is, when designing from scratch, you can often design in such a way where you don&#x27;t need (clustered) table replication or sharding - again, this also has a learning curve, for both devs and devops.You can easily spin it on a VM or on your laptop, load a dataset and see for yourself how powerful ClickHouse can be. Honestly, just the data compression alone is good enough to save a s**load of money on storage on an enterprise, compared to most solutions. Couple this with tiered storage - your hot data is eg. in ssd, your historical data is stored on s3, and rotation is done automatically, plus automated ingestion from kafka, and you have a data warehousing system at a fraction of the price of many common alternatives. reply jshen 7 hours agoparentprevWhat do you use instead? Polling APIs?

Everyone talks to the same database. Turns out we don&#x27;t really need to push extreme message rates or meet aggressive single-digit millisecond budgets, so this works out well in practice. It is also the easiest thing on earth to develop & debug, because you can monitor the table&#x2F;log and instantly understand the state of the whole system and how it got there. Oh - it is also magically included in our DR strategy. No extra infra. We don&#x27;t have to have a totally separate procedure to recover this thing.We primarily use it as a backhaul between parts of our infrastructure in order to perform RPC. The approach is for the users of the broker (our services) to poll it at whatever rate is required. This is actually a little bit clever if you think about it - Users that don&#x27;t really care about liveliness can poll for their messages every minute or so. Users that are in the hot path of a web UI could poll every 50~100ms.Polling sounds kinda shitty (at least to me) but I argue it&#x27;s the best default engineering solution until proven otherwise (assuming its not somehow harder than the other magic async event bubbling things). We don&#x27;t have a lot of services doing this so contention isn&#x27;t really a problem for us. Even if it did get to that point, I would reach for a read replica before I refactored how all of messaging worked. Most of polling is just a read operation that does nothing, so we can go horizontal on that part pretty easily. reply CyanLite4 3 hours agorootparentfyi, SQL Server has a message broker built-in.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sql&#x2F;database-engine&#x2F;config... reply jshen 5 hours agorootparentprevAh yes, just start with SQL is really the right choice for a lot if not most things.

Or do you use other alternatives around kafka for these things? reply whartung 15 hours agorootparentThere was recently an article about distributed systems that showed up here. (Harry Doyle: Christ, I can&#x27;t find it. To hell with it!)And the author made a very interesting point about message queues. Simply, any problem that could be resolved by a message queue could be resolved by load balancing or persistence, and, therefore, messages queues were actually kind of a bad idea.There were two basic issues.The first is that because of the nature of message queues, they&#x27;re either empty or full. The second is that for many of the ways that queue are used, the unit putting the request on the queue in the first place may well be waiting for the response related to the request. So you&#x27;ve just turned an every day synchronous request into a more complicated, out of band, multi-party asynchronous request.If your queues are not empty, they they are filling up. And queue capacity is a two fold problem. One, is that you simply run out of space. But, more likely, referring to the earlier point about waiting for a response, is that you run out of time. The response does not return fast enough to manage your response window to the unit making the request.This is a load balancing problem. If the queue is filling you simply don&#x27;t have the capacity to handle the current traffic. It&#x27;s also a mechanically simpler thing to send out a request and wait for the response than to do the dance via a message queue.The second part is that if you&#x27;re throwing items onto a message queue, and you \"don&#x27;t care\" about them, that is it&#x27;s a true \"fire and forget\" kind of request and direct response time is not a concern, then what does the queue gain you over simply posting it to a database table? If the request is Important, you certainly don&#x27;t want to trust it to a message queue, a device not really designed for the storage of messages. Messages in a queue are kind of trapped in no mans land, where the easiest way to get to a message is to dig through the ones piled in front of it.They&#x27;re interesting insights and worth scratching your chin and going \"Hmmm\" over. reply valenterry 15 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s also a mechanically simpler thing to send out a request and wait for the response than to do the dance via a message queue.Yeah, this is simpler for the requester, but not for the counterpart that has to respond. Because now, the responder has to have 100% uptime and better not fail during the request, otherwise things get lost.Let&#x27;s take sending emails as an example. You have a server A that can send emails, you have a server B that fulfills requests&#x2F;actions by a user. Let&#x27;s just assume that this is the (legacy) setting we are dealing with.Now, what do you do if you want to send the user an email on a certain action, e.g. a password reset or changing a payment information etc.? Is B then making a synchronous request to A? What if server A is currently down due to maintenance? What if A uses another entity to send the emails, which itself is down? How do you observe the current state of the system and e.g. detect that A is overloaded?With a message queue you get all those things for free and A doesn&#x27;t even have to have any persistence layer for \"retries\" in case of crashes etc.While it&#x27;s true that those issues can all be resolved by \"by load balancing or persistence\" it just means that you now traded one issue (having a message queue) for multiple issues (having database(s), having load balancer(s) and essentially re-implementing a part of a message queue).In most cases a message queue seems like a good trade-off. reply hughesjj 14 hours agorootparentprevKafka is less message queue (rabbitmq, sqs) and more ordered stream&#x2F;write ahead log (ala kinesis)> The first is that because of the nature of message queues, they&#x27;re either empty or full....

The fire and forget aspect is like udp in the sense that you don&#x27;t need to ensure ordering of messages (packets) or hard persistence to the database. Also, dead letter queues exist for a reason.Message queues are super useful. The highest performance systems I&#x27;ve seen use the message queue + pool of workers paradigm, as it allows you to better smooth your load (unlike immediate republishing like in sns, which requires hardware available to accept) with minimal guarantees (unlike a write ahead log such as kinesis). The buffer is also great because it allows you a bit more time to scale up both your message queue fleet and worker fleet when you get a load spike. reply thephyber 9 hours agorootparent> > The first is that because of the nature of message queues, they&#x27;re either empty or full.> ...

AZ1 clients push to AZ1 clusters; AZ2 clients push to AZ2 clusters, etc.3. What&#x27;s done to preserve order-of-operation within a kafka partition? reply ryanworl 17 hours agoparent[WarpStream co-founder and CTO here]1. Each WarpStream Agent flushes a file to S3 with all the data for every topic-partition it has received requests for in the last ~100ms or so. This means the S3 PUT operations costs scales with the number of Agents you run and the flushing interval, not the number of topic-partitions. We do not acknowledge Produce requests until data has been durably persisted in S3 and our cloud control plane.2. We think people shouldn&#x27;t have to choose between reliability and costs. WarpStream gives you the reliability and availability of running in three AZs but with the cost of one.3. We have a custom metadata database running in our cloud control plane which handles ordering. reply Fiahil 2 hours agorootparent> We have a custom metadata database running in our cloud control plane which handles ordering.This is the secret sauce, right there. Anybody can host a bunch of topics and artefacts on S3, and have them locally-replicated if they want. However, there is no world where you can have that without a synchronisation service that ensure cursors are uniques and properly ordered. reply tiew9Vii 2 hours agorootparentprevFlushing every 100ms means you would end up with lots of tiny files (bytes) in s3 unless you have something out of process re-writing them in to larger blobs similar to Delta lakes optomize?The lots of tiny files would be really inefficient from throughput and api call perspective in blob storage.With the acks, you have up to 100ms waiting for the buffer to fill, + s3 put request + your metadata request&#x2F;response. For high throughput that must have very high latency putting back pressure on partitions? reply poorman 14 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like there&#x27;s a sweet spot here. If you are not ACKing Produce requests for 100ms then there&#x27;s a huge amount latency. If the user want&#x27;s to reduce that latency from 100ms to say 1ms then their S3 GET requests cost just went up by 100x. reply ryanworl 14 hours agorootparent[WarpStream co-founder here]We&#x27;ve done lots of customer research here and, combined with the experience my co-founder and I have, we can confidently say most Kafka users (especially high-throughput users) would happily make a trade off of increased end-to-end latency in exchange for a massive cost reduction and the operational simplicity provided by WarpStream. reply richieartoul 10 hours agorootparentReplying here instead of below because we hit depth limit. WarpStream definitely isn’t magical, it makes a very real trade off around latency.On the read side, the architecture is such that you’ll have to pay for 1 GET request for every 4 MiB of data produced for each availability zone you run in. If you do the math on this, it is much cheaper than manually replicating data across zones and paying for interzone networking.RE:deletes. Deleting files in S3 is free, it can just be a bit annoying to do but the WarpStream agents manage that automatically. It’s creating files that is expensive, but the WarpStream storage engine is designed to minimize this.I will do a future blog post on how we keep S3 GET costs minimal, it’s difficult to explain in a HN comment on mobile.

And congrats on the public announcement for \"shipping Husky\", finally. --Marc reply cgio 10 hours agorootparentprevI don’t want to disagree with the research here, but what is not evident from the article is that this is not a magical solution that improves upon Kafka hands down, but rather a solution that addresses trade offs someone might be willing to entertain. I think on the query side things may be quite suboptimal in this setup if I understand it correctly. Correct me if I am wrong but if two agents write on a single topic, I would need to read two files to consume. Also I remember infamous stories about the cost of deleting data from S3, how do you tackle that if you have that many individual files? With these trade offs how does the solution compare to using Aurora? reply eldenring 5 hours agorootparentprevYes kafka is definitely in an awkward latency spot. reply guru4consulting 9 hours agorootparentprevwon&#x27;t that be a problem for high-traffic topics? Kafka latency is usually in single digit milliseconds. For a topic with high throughput, a typical java client instance can send thousands of messages per second. When the acknowledgement latency increases to 1000ms, then the producer client would need to have multiple threads to handle the blocking calls. Either producer will have to scale to multiple instances, or else risk crashing with out-of-memory errors. reply richieartoul 8 hours agorootparent(WarpStream cofounder)Yeah you have to produce in parallel and use batching, but it works well in practice. We’ve tested it up to 1GiB&#x2F;s in throughout without issue reply theikkila 17 hours agorootparentprevDoes WarpStream guarantee correct order inside partition only for acknowledged messages or also among the acknowledged messages (in different batches)? If so how do you keep clocks synchronized between the agents? reply richieartoul 17 hours agorootparent(WarpStream founder)It guarantees correct ordering inside a partition for all acknowledged messages regardless of which batch they originated from. We don&#x27;t synchronize clocks, the agents call out to our cloud metadata store which runs a per-cluster metadata store that assigns offsets to messages at commit time. Effectively \"committing\" data involves two steps:1. Write a file to S3 2. \"Commit\" that file to the metadata store which will then assign the partitions at commit time 3. Return the assigned partitions to the client reply wdwind 5 hours agorootparentThen the order is on batch level? Say batch1 is committed with a smaller timestamp than batch2, then all messages in batch1 are considered prior&#x2F;earlier than any message in batch2? reply richieartoul 5 hours agorootparentIt’s getting late and I’m not 100% confident I’m sure what you’re asking, but I believe the answer to your question is yes. When you produce a message&#x2F;batch you get back offsets for each message you produced. If you produce again after receiving that acknowledgement, the next set of offsets you receive are guaranteed to be larger than any of the offsets you received from your previous request. reply CyanLite4 3 hours agorootparentprevDoes Azure’s Append Blob support (and AWS’ lack thereof) provide any inherent performance advantages for Azure vs. AWS? reply theikkila 17 hours agorootparentprevRelated to 1. If I understood corrently the agent generates single object per each flushing interval containing all data accross all topics it has received. Does this mean that when reading the consumer needs to read multiple partition data simultaneously to access just single partition? How about scaling consumers horizontally how does WarpStream Agent handle horizontal partitioning of the stream from consuming side? reply ryanworl 17 hours agorootparent[WarpStream co-founder here]That is correct about flushing. RE: consuming. The TLDR; is that the agents in an availability zone cluster with each other to form a distributed file cache such that no matter how many consumers you attach to a topic, you will almost never pay for more than 1 GET request per 4MiB of data, per zone. Basically when a consumer fetches a block of data for a single partition, that will trigger an \"over read\" of up to 4MiB of data that is then cached for subsequent requests. This cache is \"smart\" and will deduplicate all concurrent requests for the same 4MiB blocks across all agents within an AZ.It&#x27;s a bit difficult to explain succinctly in an HN comment, but hopefully that helps. reply derefr 16 hours agorootparentIs there a reason you built that cache layer yourself (rather than each node \"just\" running its own sidecar MinIO instance, that write-throughs to the origin object store?) reply richieartoul 16 hours agorootparent(WarpStream co-founder)The cache is for reads, not writes. There is no cache for writes.We built our own because it needed to behave in a very specific way to meet our cost&#x2F;latency goals. Running a MinIO sidecar instance means that every agent would effectively have to download every file in its entirety which would not scale well and would be expensive. We also have a pretty hard and fast rule about keeping deploying WarpStream as simple as rolling out a single stateless binary. replyilikehurdles 17 hours agoparentprevRe #1 I don’t think Amazon charges for data transfers from within AWS, assuming Kafka is hosted there. reply finnh 17 hours agorootparentThere are per-API-call charges.

I have looked at the documentation and reckon we should be supporting a lot of Warpstream already. Is there any quick way to test this out? Would love to share this with our users!Whether dead or alive, there&#x27;s no denying that Kafka, or data streaming in general, is one of the most exciting fields today. Happy to welcome a new member! reply rcarmo 17 hours agoprevWell, one thing&#x27;s for sure. Running Kafka on discrete VMs on a cloud provider \"by the book\" is ludicrously expensive.I remember having a very simple discussion with quite a few customers about both Kafka and Hadoop that boiled down to this: Why replicate data at the VM&#x2F;disk level when those disks are already provided as a fully redundant system? (in this case it was Azure storage, which provides locally, redundant, AZ-redundant or globally redundant storage, most of which are available to run managed disks upon).This is why properly designed Hadoop&#x2F;Kafka cloud managed services employ storage adapters to leverage the provider&#x27;s baked in redundancy. And why some cloud providers have Kafka-compatible event brokers.The rest of what WarpStream does is just icing on the cake (although I&#x27;m curious as to the internals and how they avoid inter-AZ charges).(full disclosure: I work at Microsoft, but built Hadoop&#x2F;Spark&#x2F;Kafka clusters before joining nearly a decade ago.) reply hinkley 16 hours agoparentIn the good ol&#x27; days, we used to implement redundant systems such that there was tie breaker process that used only a fraction of the resources of the true processes. Some Raft implementations allow for nodes that are voters but cannot be quorum leaders (example: the branch office where all traffic is funneled through an asymmetric VPN tunnel should never be elected leader, but knows which candidates it can and cannot see)So the table stakes for running a cluster was not 3x as much hardware but closer to 2.2x, which is a huge deal for solutions in the small and developer sandboxes. It also matters when 3 shards don&#x27;t quite cover your load but 5 is too many. Or 6 vs 7.The problem is that with geographic replication, this doesn&#x27;t fix either of the problems articulated as part of the thesis of this article:1. Cloud economics – by design, Kafka’s replication strategy will rack up massive inter AZ bandwidth costs.2. Operational overhead – running your own Kafka cluster literally requires a dedicated team and sophisticated custom tooling.Still, we need this functionality back for cloud, particularly as the pendulum swings back to self hosting, which it always has in the past. reply cbsmith 16 hours agoparentprevOr, you know, use ephemeral data storage with your brokers like the good folks intended... reply nithril 16 hours agoparentprev> Why replicate data at the VM&#x2F;disk level when those disks are already provided as a fully redundant system?Azure disk replications are for the durability of the data, not the avalability of the data from a kafka perspective. reply derefr 16 hours agorootparentMany systems might just be using Kafka to drive async batch transaction processing (think: sending emails, charging credit cards), and therefore don&#x27;t care at all about availability. reply nithril 15 hours agorootparentFrom a read perspective I would agree but from a write perspective if the partition is not available? (genuinely asking) reply derefr 14 hours agorootparentThink Unix pipelines: writes that can&#x27;t immediately complete block the producer. (Probably with a bit of an in-memory buffer, but still.) Pile up enough un-ACKed messages to push, and the whole producer should stop consuming its own input end until the consumer on its output end comes back to start pumping messages again. The whole pipeline from the blocked stage back to the start receives backpressure and temporarily stalls out — which is fine, because, again, async batch processing.And yes, this means that you need to have logic all the way back at the original sender (the one triggering the async message-send as part of some synchronous business-logic), to be able to refuse &#x2F; abort &#x2F; revert the entire high-level business-logic operation if the async-message-send&#x27;s message-accept fails. (A user shouldn&#x27;t be considered signed up if you can&#x27;t remember to send them a verification email; a subscription should not be created if you can&#x27;t remember to charge the card; etc.)In est, you can think of this as \"semi-async\": each stage is doing a synchronous RPC call to an \"accept and buffer this batch of async messages\" endpoint on the broker — which might synchronously fail (if the broker is unavailable, or if the consumer of a bounded-size(!) queue has blocked to create backpressure and therefore the queue has filled and the broker has in turn stopped accepting to that queue.)With such an API, rather than pretending that there&#x27;s some magic reliable-delivery system you can \"fire and forget\" messages onto, these failures gets bubbled up to the caller on the send side, like any other failure of a synchronous RPC call.Take this to its fullest extent, and you get Google&#x27;s \"effectively synchronous\" RPC philosophy, where you have event brokers for routing and discoverability (think k8s Services), but async messages are always either queued in either the sender process&#x27;s [bounded] outbox, or the recipient process&#x27;s [bounded] inbox, with no need for a broker-side queue, because everything is designed with backpressure + graceful handling of potential accept failure in mind, including the initial clients knowing to retry pushing the initial message-send. (If you&#x27;re familiar with the delivery semantics of Golang channels — it&#x27;s basically that, but distributed rather than process-internal. There&#x27;s a reason that particular language feature came out of a language designed at Google.)---Mind you, there&#x27;s also the \"truly async\" batch-processing semantics — the kind ATMs have, where if even the initial client doing a synchronous operation (think: withdrawing cash) can&#x27;t get in contact with the server&#x2F;broker to push the async message-sends, then you just append the message to a big ol&#x27; local log file, and proceed as if the async sends already succeeded; and then later, when you come back online, you dump your whole built-up log of messages to the broker, and all events in the log are inherently accepted — but there are higher-level semantics that might generate additional revert events in response to some of them (i.e. if the ATM user overdrew their account), that get backfed into the system. But you, as the initial producer of messages, don&#x27;t have to worry about collating those against your messages or anything like that. reply rcarmo 14 hours agorootparentprevManaged disks reside on redundant and high availability storage. reply kabochya 5 hours agoprevWe&#x27;ve built something probably very similar to this product at my previous job. We had double digit TB daily ML traffic that didn&#x27;t require realtime latency, so we moved those all onto S3 and also saw approx ~90% cost savings. This was built on top of JVM and still used a 6 broker Kafka cluster to keep metadata (vs probably 300 when it was originally all on Kafka). Kafka&#x27;s compute and storage model doesn&#x27;t scale too well for the extreme use cases that can tolerate latency, and the Apache Pulsar model sort of worked better (though at that time Pulsar wasn&#x27;t too stable for us to use in prod). One of the keys to cost efficiency for us was that the size of the data was large enough that we didn&#x27;t need to wait too long before hitting an economic file size to upload. Trying to imagine how a pipeline with less than 10 MB&#x2F;s would work with this efficiently. reply richieartoul 5 hours agoparent(WarpStream co-founder)Yeah we’ve run into a number of people who’ve rolled their own solution in this space.

This is the rule in many monarchies past and present, though not all. So, imagine that the (old) king dies at the end of the first clause and therefore the (new) king takes office at the beginning of the second. reply bothra90 16 hours agoprevExciting work!

The main goal of Kafka is providing certain processing guarantees and connecting consumers with producers of events.What Kafka is not for is dealing with enormous number of events or enormous amount of data. Not that it is particularly slow at it (actually, quite fast) but I see a lot of people needlessly try to push more data and events than they need and then complain they have problems.One easy trick to deal with enormous numbers of events and amounts of data is batching. Just batch some number of events into a single event so that a consumer can pick it up in one go. Removes a lot of cost of transferring the event.Too much data to transfer? Don&#x27;t be stupid and try to transfer those huge documents through the Kafka topic -- there is no need for this. Just upload them to S3 and pass through a reference. Or even better, take 10k events, extract data, zip it up, push to S3, and THEN pass a single event that describes 10k large events. reply ec109685 4 hours agoparentYou’ve described the tricks WarpSream does in their implementation, buffering data until a large enough chunk can be written to S3. reply Hixon10 15 hours agoprevI wonder, will we have any solution for local development?

So, I wouldn&#x27;t bank on them submitting to a Jepsen test. :) reply abhinav-t 14 hours agorootparentI think that WarpStream relying on a proprietary metadata store isn&#x27;t an issue for Jepsen tests. If I understand correctly, Jepsen tests treat the distributed databases (or logs like Kafka) pretty much as a black box. Jepsen tests introduce partitions and look for missing&#x2F;unexpected items against the items that were acknowledged as written successfully by the system.If you look at Kyle&#x27;s blog post, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;293-jepsen-kafka, there is no mention of looking into a broker&#x27;s storage or any storage for that matter. reply richieartoul 14 hours agorootparentprev(WarpStream co-founder)FWIW we subject WarpStream to continuous chaos&#x2F;fault injection in our integration tests and staging environment to verify correctness and liveness properties.

For that, we have our own custom metadata store that \"imposes\" ordering guarantees on top of the data that is written to S3.We don&#x27;t rely on any kind of timestamp-based last write wins policy for concurrent writes. In fact the agents will never write a file to S3 with the same name more than once or overwrite an existing file. reply pshirshov 14 hours agorootparentSo, in fact it&#x27;s not really stateless, you have your locking&#x2F;ordering layer and you implement some consensus for that layer? reply richieartoul 12 hours agorootparentIts stateless from the customer&#x27;s perspective since they don&#x27;t have to manage the consensus layer (which is only possible because we separated data from metadata).Obviously there is state somewhere since the cluster is storing data, its just offloaded to S3 + our control plane, while still keeping all the data in the customer&#x27;s cloud account. reply pshirshov 9 hours agorootparentI think you should write some detailed docs about your design and consistency guarantees. replyrickette 16 hours agoprevWill this only exist as a managed service (SaaS) or will there be an open source (or open core) version? reply EamonnMR 16 hours agoprevHave you considered making a plain HTTPS frontend like Confluent&#x27;s REST proxy?

I am happy to see the launch of Warpstream! I just reviewed the project and here&#x27;s my personal opinion:* Apache Kafka is undoubtedly the leading product in the streaming platform space. It offers a simple yet effective API that has become the golden standard. All streaming&#x2F;messaging vendors need to adhere to Kafka protocol.* The original Kafka only used local storage to store data, which can be extremely expensive if the data volume is large. That&#x27;s why many people are advocating for the development of Kafka Tiered Storage (KIP-405: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cwiki.apache.org&#x2F;confluence&#x2F;display&#x2F;KAFKA&#x2F;KIP-405%3A...). To my best knowledge, there are at least five vendors selling Kafka or Kafka-compatible products with tiered storage support:-- Confluent, which builds Kora, the 10X Kafka engine: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confluent.io&#x2F;10x-apache-kafka&#x2F;;-- Aiven, the open-source tiered storage Kafka (source code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aiven-Open&#x2F;tiered-storage-for-apache-kafk...-- Redpanda Data, which cuts your TCO by 6X (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redpanda.com&#x2F;platform-tco);-- DataStax, which commercializes Apache Pulsar (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pulsar.apache.org&#x2F;);-- StreamNative, which commercializes Apache Pulsar (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pulsar.apache.org&#x2F;).* WarpStream claims to be \"built directly on top of S3,\" which I believe is a very aggressive approach that has the potential to drastically reduce costs, even compared to tiered storage. The potential tradeoff is system performance, especially in terms of latency. As new technology, WarpStream brings novelty, and definitely it also needs to convince users that the service is robust and reliable.* BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) is becoming the default option. Most of the vendors listed above offer BYOC, where data is stored in customers&#x27; cloud accounts, addressing concerns about data privacy and security.I believe WarpStream is new technology to this market, and and would encourage the team to publish some detailed numbers to confirm its performance and efficiency! reply mdaniel 13 hours agoparentIf you&#x27;re still within the edit window for your comment, the \");\" in them are attached to the URLs, making them problematic to clicked-- Confluent, which builds Kora, the 10X Kafka engine: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confluent.io&#x2F;10x-apache-kafka&#x2F;-- Aiven, the open-source tiered storage Kafka (source code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aiven-Open&#x2F;tiered-storage-for-apache-kafk...-- Redpanda Data, which cuts your TCO by 6X https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redpanda.com&#x2F;platform-tco-- DataStax, which commercializes Apache Pulsar https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pulsar.apache.org&#x2F;-- StreamNative, which commercializes Apache Pulsar https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pulsar.apache.org&#x2F; reply insanitybit 16 hours agoprevPretty cool.

Amazon has very good credit (AA or AA-), which in a lot of cases probably means they have access to cheaper money than their landlord does.

I’ve been looking for properties with a stream but they seem pretty far between. reply samtho 6 hours agorootparentI own 4.2 acres in the Sierras north of US-50 between Kyburz and South Lake Tahoe at 5,600ft elevation. It was not easy to find, but there is a seasonal creek that runs through it fed by snowmelt. I had to drill a well 600ft down to find water year round, there are no utilities so I had to dig out for septic, get propane storage for generator power, and I have a gravel path via an easement into an adjacent property to link to a forest service road. As remote and unconnected it was, it still fetched an amount that I am not super happy with, but I acknowledge even that price I got it for was cheap. I knew what I was getting into, specifically buying it after the major fire up there two years ago and was able to get a wide open tree-cleared area that I didn’t have to gain authorization to remove. I fully intend to build a cabin up there and then probably resell it because it’s too remote to AirBnB.I think you should carefully consider your goals and what you want out of a location (must haves vs nice to haves and a list of dealbreakers).There are a few things you probably take for granted. If your are considering an off grid or at least remote location, some things you should keep in mind:- More than ten miles is a long way to get groceries, especially if primitive roads make part of the drive.- It gets dark when you’re outside of civilization, don’t leave lit areas unless you must.- Carry extra fuel at all times, you should also have a working, spare vehicle that you actively maintain.- If you are settling in an area with snow, both your vehicles need to be AWD with snow tires and you should carry chains at all times when it’s season for snow.- The spare vehicle should have a full tank of gas and spare fuel treated with an enzyme to keep it stable.- You should have spare parts for your home and car, be comfortable with doing a lot of stuff yourself.- Know the fastest and slower but more reliable route to the nearest hospital.- Get a cell phone repeater from your cell company (they often even do it for free if you power it).- Make sure your house has a power inlet so you can use a portable generator in case your permanent one fails or have a very beefy car inverter so your spare card can power your house.- Have backup fuel for your generator.- You should have one week of food, water, and generator fuel on reserve at all time.- Your firewood pile should be sheltered, covered from the elements, and easy to get to from your home.- Maintain a sat phone (one with minimal minutes is fine, this is backup comms).And be sure to remember that shit gets or feels weird for us when we live in remote locations. You will start to see things if you let it get to you. If you plan on exploring, be prepared to come across (and avoid) carcasses, wild animals, poison oak or ivy, strange or out of place structures, people walking around who don’t answer or acknowledge you when you call out, trust your gut and fucking bolt when things are just not right even if you can’t put your finger on it.I have hallucinated people that disappear when you try to approach them, full and partial structures that seem to dilapidate when I approach them. I’ve seen brand new cars driven out miles off the highway left with their door open as if someone just got out and walked away never to return, burnt out cars miles out in the wilderness, heard children laughing in the distance at midnight in the pitch black, heard the moaning of someone in pain but nobody to be found.Maybe the most unsettling thing is when you walk into a specific area of the forest and, as if all the air is sucked out, it goes so quiet enough that you can hear your own pulse and rumbling of blood flowing through your ear. You feel, not hear, this low, intense hum, a sense of dread falls over you, as if you are being watched or hunted. This happened to me back in May when I ran across a set of poured, concrete stairs in a clearing as if built for a porch, but no foundation where the house should have been.Nobody told me this lifestyle would cause me to become afraid of the dark again. I used to camp up there but now I don’t go up there unless it’s light and I can be back on the highway well before nightfall.

We become accustomed to the sounds of our own neighborhood and city in general, so if you stop all these sounds and introduce new ones, in addition to literally being isolated and unable to read others’ emotions on the situation, our brains generate discomfort via anxiety and stress. The vulnerability aspect is due to the fact that we don’t know what’s out there. When we’re walking around in the darkness, our brains are determining that we are in danger and attempts to signal to us that we need to GTFO. Being in terrifying situations will heighten that response. reply dmos62 2 hours agorootparentprevDrop me an email if you&#x27;re interested in those stairs. reply bradly 9 hours agoparentprevAre you milling with an alaskan mill or are you using a horizontal band saw?

I think anyone who likes manual work can find a piece of a telescope that&#x27;s enjoyable to work on.The feeling you get after a few nights of hardware debugging, when everything properly works and you get a sharp focus in a clear night, that&#x27;s quite a step above any of my other hobby projects to this day (:Plus, you can always improve it with ergonomic modifications or additions to make observing sessions smoother.Edit : here&#x27;s a pic at first light of my last one (8\" f&#x2F;3.52)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;camo.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;5939ba170acf1e9d6462d8268...Now moving on to do twins 16.5\" and 16\" mirrors and scopes with a friend who is joining me into this adventure :-) reply jacknews 20 hours agoparentI designed and made a &#x27;cheapscope&#x27; out of PVC pipe, 3d printed parts, and cheap aliexpress 76mm mirror, mounted on a camera tripod.It works well enough for the moon etc, and, as I&#x27;m based in a developing country, many people have never seen the sky except with the naked eye, so the gasps and oohs, etc are priceless.I had intended to document and open-source the whole thing, but was busy at the time, and the PLA prints have since completely disintegrated in the hot humidity, lol.

Mainly straight forward but requires planning and at some points tricky sawing. It&#x27;s cool when people come in and un-prompted say \"wow that&#x27;s a great floor you have here\"2. Maybe 4 years ago, I completely disassembled and repaired a through-wall heating and cooling unit in our NYC apartment because it wasn&#x27;t producing a lot of air. Previously, repairmen came out and said it was working as normal and just wasn&#x27;t meant to produce more air. This taught me a lot about electronics, HVAC, testing, and shopping at vendor-supply stores. People are shocked that a civilian was able to do this repair.EDIT: I&#x27;ll add one more:3. Replacing the screen on my Pixel 6 Pro. It fell out of my pocket while biking, and although it wouldn&#x27;t have been the end of the world to just get a replacement, I thought it would be fun to try and repair.

I think I ruled that out pretty quickly because one of the symptoms was icing on the evaporator side - so I figured the compressor side was producing enough cool.At the end of the day the problem was the evaporator blower motor.

I suspect repair-folks don&#x27;t do a lot of returns. EG - if they buy a capacitor and then it&#x27;s not what was wrong, they end up keeping it for another job whereas I retired it. Also, when I bought the motor that was the manufacturer specified replacement, it wasn&#x27;t a perfect match for some other part of the unit. I had to bike back to the store and the guy gave me some bushings (which solved the issue) but real repair people would probably know that the shaft thickness changed on that motor and carry some bushings around anyway.So yeah they were fine to do business with me but they normally deal with large-size orders probably, so my stuff was \"cute\" but most certainly not a priority for them. reply d0gsg0w00f 14 hours agoparentprev> it was really not a big dea.I read this like a joke that the far right of his touchscreen doesn&#x27;t work anymore and can&#x27;t type the letter \"L\" reply xyzelement 14 hours agorootparent:) I appreciate that!

There are a lot of kit manufacturers out there, offering a wide range of aircraft styles and purposes from back-country to aerobatic to long-range cruise airplanes and more. Materials can include aluminum, fiberglass, wood-and-fabric, and others. The EAA[1] has a lot of information about the various kits. I went with a Vans[2] which are very popular kits with a huge volunteer support&#x2F;help community online and offline. They list kit prices on their web site, but they are exclusive of engine, propeller and avionics, which can be significant. Fortunately, since it takes a looong time to build, these costs can be spread out over many years to make it manageable.

I LOVE airplanes and being in the air, and everything at all to do with aviation, so I once entertained the idea of getting a PPL. I called around to the various local airports and clubs to get an idea of what was involved. Although I could technically afford it, the price tag was eye-wateringly expensive for what would realistically amount to an expensive and non-trivially dangerous hobby for me. I expect those who are able to do it on the cheap already have a network in place in order to get steep discounts on their instructor&#x27;s hours, or something to that effect.* Also, I eventually decided that I don&#x27;t have what it takes to be a competent pilot anyway.

(If you&#x27;re in the Netherlands and want to come to one, my email&#x27;s in my profile!)It took about 5 years to build (on and off) and I say \"built\" but I actually bought a large part of the hull of the boat to start; however, somewhere around 90% of the boat by mass is stuff that I&#x27;ve made entirely myself or worked on significantly, so I&#x27;d still say I built it.Because the title specifically asked for cool: I&#x27;ve built a lot of other serious physical things in my life but the boat somehow has some serious cool power. When I started throwing parties on it I expected a somewhat modest reception - it&#x27;s a medium sized steel boat, not a superyacht - but for some reason it&#x27;s attracted the coolest other people: composers, neuroscientists, filmmakers, martial artists, costume designers, makeup artists for movies, a super unique crowd.

Coolest single thing I built in the house is probably the kitchen peninsula which I somehow aced the oak waterfall on (thanks to Festool I guess).Sounds kind of cool listed out like that but it was a shit ton of work, it&#x27;s still not fully done and as I was an absolute beginner with limited time a lot of things are half-assed or have to be redone at some point.

Like mid way through an install? As far as I&#x27;m aware there&#x27;s no rules about which side the phase should be on, and googling only shows some electricians prefer to have phase on the left side because it&#x27;s easy to remember and consistency helps with debugging. reply avar 10 hours agorootparentAs far as I know a Schuko socket can have live on either the left or right (looking at it), but there&#x27;s a strong convention for having it on the right.Partly this is compatibility between CEE 7&#x2F;3 and 7&#x2F;5 and 7&#x2F;7[1], The Netherlands almost universally using the first.I have a socket tester designed for Schuko (similar to, but not exactly [2]), it (and AFAICT this is universal among them) enforces \"live on the right\".What is definitely standardized us that the wires in your wall should be brown=live and blue=neutral (in the UK and European continent, other places may differ).Once you start mixing up neutral and live in sockets it&#x27;ll often lead to a mixup in the wall wiring, as sockets are often used as a starting point to extend wiring. I partially rewired my house to fix that issue, left by an electrician.As an extra data point, e.g. Jung sells pre-wired sockets which assume that you follow this convention[3]. If you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll end up with reversed wires in your wall, i. e. wires mixed up by color, not just the socket itself violating some convention of live=right.The photo in [3] is low resolution, so you can&#x27;t see the tiny \"Jung\" logo on the inner part of the socket, which indicates which side is up.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.m.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:European_plug_and_...2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.eu&#x2F;d&#x2F;1HuzNPJ3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elektramat.nl&#x2F;jung-dubbel-stopcontact-met-randaa... replyirrational 17 hours agorootparentprevGas?

If you see this & can elaborate, how did the Cape Falcon build process compare to the stitch and glue CLC and to the non-Cape Falcon skin-on-frame?Also, do you find yourself using one or the other of the boats more or less?Either way&#x2F;no matter what, fun to see this answer on HN! Thanks! reply cossatot 12 hours agorootparentThe Cape Falcon plans are far more detailed so there is a lot less figuring out stuff by yourself, relative to getting written plans. It&#x27;s definitely a much more efficient process and there is probably a lot less variance in the result. I winged it on my Aleutian kayak a lot with mixed results (I gave it a lot of rocker and some other whitewater-inspired geometry). Of the kayaks, I prefer the Aleutian skin on frame although it was quite painful before I got the seat dialed in, and sometimes I can&#x27;t roll it very well (I&#x27;m an expert whitewater boater and have a very solid roll), and its top speed is low. But it is very light, maneuverable, quiet (waves hitting it don&#x27;t make much sound) and the peaked deck sheds water so it doesn&#x27;t spray your face when you are punching through waves in the surf. The F1 is probably best of both worlds.The Cape Falcon canoe that I built deviates a bit from the design pattern because I wanted a wide and flat bottom with harder edges, similar to a lot of modern Royalex tandem canoes. It&#x27;s a 16&#x27; tandem I think, and even though it is pretty wide, it is still less stable than most canoes. However it is fast and extremely maneuverable in Class III.Skin on frame is also awesome because when you are loading or unloading a 17&#x27; boat in a crowded beach parking lot and smack the bow into the car next to yours, it doesn&#x27;t do any damage to either car or boat, or so I hear.Stitch and glue is straightforward but the woodworking part goes fast and then it&#x27;s just a ton of fiberglass work, i.e. cycles of epoxy and sanding, which is not that enjoyable for its own sake. On the other hand, one of the great parts of skin on frame construction is that other than a short amount of time ripping the ribs on a table saw, the rest is basically quiet and without harsh chemicals, so you don&#x27;t need earmuffs or a respirator and can listen to music and have a snack&#x2F;drink.Stitch and glue will last forever if you protect it from UV, however skin on frame will most likely need to be reskinned in 5-10 years or so. reply getpost 15 hours agoparentprevI also built a kayak (in the 70s)!

Id love to hear more about it.Also agree quaternions are the worst. You should check out n-vectors.

The system used traditional manual scanning system with a VGA capture card on the back. I synced that with an off the shelf IR capture system and was able to record the ultrasonic scan into a video file using opencv. I would also record a USB cam at the same time as a sanity check. I could generate point clouds of data by reading the video file and the synced position data to project where the ultrasound was going and the linear response of the scanner. Was a ton of fun to develop and it was nice that I pretty much only had myself to blame when things went wrong. I also had to write the procedure for operation in case someone else had to use it. reply anfractuosity 16 hours agoparentprevThat sounds really fascinating, could you post the patent no. or a link to more information?

    "originBody": "AUG. 7, 2023, 3:32 P.M. Raku: A Language for Gremlins By Gremlins, For Gremlins™ Computer Things I just added a big new section to learntla: Optimizing TLA+ Model Checking. I take a spec and then show 15 different optimizations, many of them getting a 10x runtime improvement. Patreon notes here. Besides that I've done very little writing the last couple weeks. I'm just in a slump: I sit down to write and the words all come out wrong. It happens sometimes and there's nothing to do about it but wait it out. So instead of working I've been learning Raku.1 It originally got on my radar after I ranted about dynamic languages and a couple of users told me I'd like Raku. I finally checked it out last week to see if it'd make a good \"calculator language\". I use a hodgepodge of Python, J, Frink, and Excel to do math and they all have their own big drawbacks, so it'd be nice if Raku could round them out. After several days of experiments, I'm at a loss of how to describe Raku. The best I can come up with is that the language was designed by a bunch of really intelligent gremlins. Gremlins who spent a lot of time gathering feedback from other gremlins. Weird Operators Raku has no qualms about using Unicode operators. You check set membership with ∈. There's also ∉, ∋, and ∌. It's also fine with alphanumeric infix operators. String repetition op is x. Function composition is o. > \"a\" x 3 aaa > my &f = &sqrt o &abs {noise} > f -3 1.7320508075688772 X gives you the cross product of a list, Xf applies f to each element of the cross product, Zf does the same with zip. >X((a 1) (a 2) (a 3) (b 1) (b 2) (b 3) (c 1) (c 2) (c 3)) >Xx(a aa aaa b bb bbb c cc ccc) >Zx(a bb ccc) If f is an infix operator, then [f] reduces a list and [\\f] accumulates it: > [+]15 > [\\+](1 3 6 10 15) ~~ is the \"anything goes\" matcher. > \"abc\" ~~ \"abc\" # do the strings match? True > \"abc\" ~~ Str # is abc a string? True > \"abc\" ~~ {.chars == 3} # is abc length 3? True > so \"abc\" ~~ /^b/ #does abc start with b? False Finally, there's .... > 0,1,2...10 (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10) > 0,2,4...10 (0 2 4 6 8 10) > 1,2,4...10 (1 2 4 8) Defining operators So you know how some languages let you define infix operators? Raku lets you also define new circumfix and postcircumfix operators. # circumfix sub circumfix:($inner){sum($inner)} > [∀ 1,3,5...10 zz 25 # vector inner product! sub postcircumfix:(@left, @inside){[+] (@left Z* @inside)} > |⟩ 32 In addition to left- and right-associative infix operators, you can define operators to be chain associative (like how x$elem {$elem + $x})} multi f(@arr, $x) {@arr.map(-> $elem {$elem + $x})} multi f(@arr1, @arr2) {@arr1 Z+ @arr2} > f(2, ); (3 4 5) > f(, ) (4 6 8) This isn't weird, lots of languages have multiple dispatch. What is weird is that you can also dispatch based on a runtime predicate of the value. multi my_abs(Int $x where {$x > 0}) {$x} multi my_abs(Int $x) {-$x} > map &my_abs,Also the signature of a function is a first-class value, as are the parameters in the signature. Miscellaneous Things If you define a MAIN function, any parameters you give it will be automatically turned into CLI flags. Objects have way more preloaded methods than I've seen in any language, and I used to do Rails. The List object has methods for getting all permutations, all k-combinations, and all sliding windows. Junctions are this weird type-value-thing for doing multiple comparisons at once. 1|2 expands to any(1, 2), so 1 < 1|2. 1&2 expands to all(1, 2), so 1 !< 1&2. Oh yeah and you can negate any infix operator by prefixing it with !. Raku is the only language I've ever seen that has $kebab-case names and infix subtraction, I'm guessing because sigils disambiguate x-y. The regex syntax isn't backwards compatible with Perl 5. For thirty years languages followed the PCRE \"standard\" and Perl 6 just… threw it all away. That's just a tiny slice of all the weird Raku features, since I've only been looking at calculator applications so far. I haven't even learned about the object system, packages, or grammars! And even so, I still left out a ton of stuff. Like in a function body, samewith will call the same function with new arguments. I think if I had to maintain a Raku legacy codebase my brain would explode. I have no idea how people would manage to write this language In The Large. At the same time, it seems incredible for programming In The Small. One-off scripts, computations, personal tooling, all the kinds of things I wanted to do with it in the first place. I've also seen some really frustrating things: The documentation is really poor and the heavy reliance on symbols makes it hard to search for things. I've learned a lot of poorly-documented languages but Raku is much bigger and more complex than any of them and it can be real demotivating. The REPL crashes on Windows if I type in any Unicode. The compiler is also pretty slow, with even small files taking half a second or more. Iterating on things is painful. I hate the sigil thing. I spent half an hour debugging a problem because I wrote $x instead of @x. Overall? Maybe I'm just a gremlin at heart, but I think I like this language and want it to succeed. I assume I'll have a more balanced picture thoughts after I use it in anger. I just hope that over time the compile times and documentation improve.

How much should the language surprise you?2. When the language does surprise you, should it delight you or horrify you? surprising ^|delighthorrify|v unsurprisingOnly a sadist would deliberately design a language for the top right quadrant, but there are many esoteric languages in there. I think most people tacitly assume that all well-behaved languages belong on the bottom left: the language should rarely suprise you but in the rare case it does, hopefully it&#x27;s a delight.Raku seems to overtly aim for the mostly-unoccupied top left. It&#x27;s like the designers and users (two sets with apparently very large overlap) all think, \"Yes, it&#x27;s weird. Isn&#x27;t that grand!\" reply toast0 12 hours agoparentThe problem is those are subjective axes. And things can both delight and horrify; I wrote some javascript once where I did document.write = function ... which is kind of delightful in that I was able to do what I needed as a result, but also pretty horrifying :)Other people I showed it to felt it was more on the horrifying side, but like I said, it&#x27;s subjective. reply resonious 9 hours agorootparentThis is true. Often times it&#x27;s simple, stuff I wrote: delightful. stuff other people wrote: horrifying. reply throwaway2037 2 hours agorootparentThis was early Perl code for me (early 2000s). Write once; read never. Once you and your teammates developed some discipline, it got much better. reply librasteve 44 minutes agorootparentI think that this is the crux of the story for raku ... if you want you language to apply a standard discipline, then use Python: if you are happy with your team developing a dialect that balances usability with discipline, then try Raku reply shagie 12 hours agorootparentprevThen a 3d chart with \"likelihood of\" being a point or region in the space. The axises would then be \"Surprise\", \"Delight\", and \"Horrify\". reply dkarl 9 hours agorootparentContext is critical. Unless you&#x27;re a beginner with the language, surprise in a production codebase is horrifying. The Perl philosophy has never been compatible with lack of surprise. Perl wants to be like natural language, and natural language has limitless surprises.The problem with Perl (or, I assume, Raku) in production is that the responsible way to read it is like reading every single footnote in an annotated edition of Shakespeare. It sucks the joy out of it, and joy is the point. Production Perl is joyless and therefore pointless, unless you&#x27;re some kind of prodigy who understands every obscure political reference and every 16th century pun without any help. reply Dylan16807 5 hours agorootparent> Context is critical. Unless you&#x27;re a beginner with the language, surprise in a production codebase is horrifying.Why? Are you assuming a very particular kind of surprise here?\"Oh, I can replace these five lines with a single builtin.\" is a surprise, and so is seeing that someone else already did so. reply silisili 9 hours agorootparentprevI was thinking axes of &#x27;readability&#x27; and &#x27;expressiveness&#x27; would make a nice chart for programming languages. reply thayne 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think those are orthgonal though. For example, if a language lacks expressiveness, that can hinder its readability. But on the flip side, if it is highly expressive that can also potentially hurt readibility, especially if the reader isn&#x27;t very familiar with the language. Although both are somewhat subjective (readability moreso than expressiveness), and context specific. reply silisili 3 hours agorootparentExactly, they don&#x27;t need to be orthogonal in my opinion. Every language should strive to be in the top right quadrant.Keep in mind, this is just what I value in a language. The perfect programming language to me is one that is expressive while also being easy to read. I think Python is nice in that regard, and probably why it&#x27;s so popular to this day. But there&#x27;s always room for improvement! reply fuzztester 8 hours agorootparentprevAs long as the negative sides of both axes are included too. e|-r ------------- r|-e reply fuzztester 8 hours agorootparentFilling in language names is left as a fun exercise for the reader. reply silisili 8 hours agorootparentPython top right, Go bottom right, Brainfuck bottom left, Rust or Perl top left.(Don&#x27;t kill me fanatics) reply Dylan16807 4 hours agorootparentDo you think many people would put Rust and Perl next to each other? reply silisili 3 hours agorootparentIn this chart, sure. Not like, the same dot, but both in that quadrant. But those are my personal opinions, as I find both difficult to read yet very expressive. YMMV. reply Dylan16807 2 hours agorootparentInteresting. I haven&#x27;t heard anyone complain that Rust is harder to read than the average language, just stuff about writing it. reply NikkiA 2 hours agorootparentSome of the dewrapping constructs can get a bit gnarly looking when there is something wrapped in a wrapper in a wrapper sort of thing. But it&#x27;s probably largely author-dependant and you could write the same code more readably. replyeddd-ddde 12 hours agoparentprevI found about raku one time I had an assignment for college where I needed to create a parser. I found raku&#x27;s grammar features really interesting and used it for my project, it felt almost like cheating since it did pretty much every thing for me (actually it was probably just cheating but it was still fun). reply chriswarbo 31 minutes agorootparent> it felt almost like cheating since it did pretty much every thing for meDuring my undergrad I implemented a semester-long physics project in about 10 minutes. The supervisor had previously taught the Programming in C module, so I asked if I had to use C; he said I didn&#x27;t, so I used numpy.

I build rr from source, it&#x27;s relatively easy to do. reply db48x 10 hours agorootparentprevIt does have some annoying hardware requirements. It works on both modern Intel and AMD Ryzen CPUs, but if your CPU is too old it just can’t. And at any time the next generation of CPUs could break the whole thing, although that hasn’t been a problem yet. reply cogman10 12 hours agoparentprevI mean, it was \"Perl 6\" so is it really surprising that Perl devs wanted a language that looks nothing like any other language?Perl has it&#x27;s own healthy share of \"delightful surprises\" and Raku was mostly designed to eliminate perl&#x27;s horrifying surprises. reply throwanem 11 hours agorootparentApparently by replacing them with new horrifying surprises, if this article is any indication.Good grief, I don&#x27;t miss working in Perl. reply cogman10 10 hours agorootparentOne person&#x27;s unspeakable horror is another&#x27;s creature comfort. reply fuzztester 8 hours agorootparentDe gustibus ... reply pawelmurias 2 hours agorootparentprevSome of the Raku people think that showing of the most bizarre parts of the language makes it look good for some weird reason. reply fuzztester 9 hours agorootparentprev>Good grief, I don&#x27;t miss working in Perl.Good and grief in the same sentence about the same language ...

Inputting a unique prefix doesn&#x27;t sound practical. reply codeflo 3 hours agorootparentThat would lead to weird behavior since the OEIS is sorted by number of references, which I think prefers \"interesting\" solutions over straightforward ones. For (1, 2, 3), the positive integers are only ranked 5th -- the top hit are the Fibonacci numbers. It&#x27;s funny to think about. reply flir 9 hours agorootparentprevI thought about that. I thought the compiler could error with \"Insufficient data for meaningful answer\" until you&#x27;d added enough digits that the sequence was unambiguous.Then I tried it in OEIS and as you say there are too many sequences that start [1,2,3,4,5,...] - I think we may be stuck with generators and yield. But they&#x27;re not exactly delightful. reply Sharlin 1 hour agorootparent> \"Insufficient data for meaningful answer\"Nice reference, by the way. reply nerdponx 11 hours agorootparentprevMaybe there&#x27;s some way to extend the compiler to use OEIS. Is there a \"liboeis\" that lets you download and interact with the OEIS database offline? reply anthk 11 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s must be one or two for either Python or Perl.

We need more dimensions?) reply aldanor 12 hours agorootparentTo put it differently, the new C++ is delightfully horrific at times. reply ModernMech 12 hours agorootparentprevC++ occupies a region of the space rather than a singular point, since old C++ is part of new C++. reply baq 4 hours agorootparentI’d say C++ fills the space. It can be as dumb or as clever as you want it. It’s horrifying in a third dimension. reply munificent 12 hours agorootparentprevMaybe C? reply actionfromafar 12 hours agorootparentYou can definitely get there with C but the language isn’t actively pushing you into horror. reply munificent 10 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t actively push you there, which is why it&#x27;s on the bottom half. There is a fairly coherent mental model for C and once you have it, the language rarely surprises you.But when it does surprise you, it&#x27;s almost never anything good. Stuff like Duff&#x27;s device, `3[someArray] = value`, etc. The surprises are always the language&#x27;s raw machinery showing through in unpleasant ways, and never a delightful bonus feature the designers added for you. reply trealira 10 hours agorootparent> The surprises are always the language&#x27;s raw machinery showing through in unpleasant ways, and never a delightful bonus feature the designers added for you.I was reading \"Writing Solid Code\" by Steve Maguire (though it should really be called \"how to write code in C without shooting yourself in the foot\"). One thing that surprised me, but which made sense, was that pointers can overflow. It&#x27;s unlikely, and ANSI non-compliant, but something possible nonetheless. Hence, Maguire said that this code: void *memchr(void *pv, unsigned char ch, size_t size) { unsigned char *pch = (unsigned char *)pv; unsigned char *pchEnd = pch + size; while (pch0) { if (*pch == ch) return (pch); pch++; } return (NULL); }Just the little things C lets you think about. This seems like a bug that would occur every once in a blue moon. reply JonChesterfield 8 hours agorootparentGone through a whole range of emotions looking at this. Tried to put together an argument about the high bits of (common) address spaces being zero and therefore it&#x27;s safe but I don&#x27;t think that works. It&#x27;s the while (i++ Tried to put together an argument about the high bits of (common) address spaces being zero and therefore it&#x27;s safe but I don&#x27;t think that works.Yep; on AMD64, bits 48 through 63 must be identical to bit 47, which can be 1 or 0, akin to sign extension.In practice, I don&#x27;t think any sane OS would let you reserve the very last n bytes of memory, especially not with an address space as large as that of AMD64, but you can&#x27;t assume the architecture, and you don&#x27;t always have an operating system.And yeah, you could see the same bug with integer array indices, if signed integers wrap. &#x2F;* Endless loop if end == INT_MAX *&#x2F; for (int i = 0; iNeeds to be unsigned to get this failure mode, any signed loop gets compiled assuming no overflow for a different (though similar!) failure mode.In C and C++, compilers will optimize assuming that signed integer overflow doesn&#x27;t happen, but that doesn&#x27;t stop it from actually happening. Unless you set it to trap on overflow, signed integers still wrap; it&#x27;s just that compilers make (incorrect) optimizations assuming that it doesn&#x27;t happen.You know, this makes me wonder whether it&#x27;s better pointers to be compared with signed or unsigned comparisons. Currently, my compiler emits unsigned comparison instructions for them. replya1369209993 8 hours agorootparentprev> The surprises are always the language&#x27;s raw machinery showing through in unpleasant ways, and never a delightful bonus feature the designers added for you.Not always. It&#x27;s rare, but eg `o[objects].up[objects].t[textures]` was definitely a delightful bonus feature (where `objects` and `textures` are global arrays). reply segfaultbuserr 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s the \"unsurprising\" part in \"unsurprising & horrifying\" - if you manipulate raw pointers incorrectly, of course it will crash or be vulnerable, to the surprise of no one by design. reply actionfromafar 12 hours agorootparentThis rings true the more I think about it. Any large code base gets there with size, but with C one gets there pretty reliably after a certain heft of code. reply segfaultbuserr 12 hours agorootparentThat being said, while C&#x27;s surprises are certainly fewer than other languages, it still does have a few surprising corner cases in contrary to its usual \"portable assembly\" character (without compiler optimization) - implicit type promotion in expressions with mixed data types, potential malloc() in printf(), possibility of Duff&#x27;s device, and the likes.

That happened for me long before it became Raku.I clearly remember reading through the synopsis and exegesis documents around fifteen years ago and being excited for what was to come, but I also remember the first bits that gave me pause. Like unspace[1].I also clearly remember when it started dawning on me that Perl 6 (as it was still called at the time) would never see any real adoption by people that were interested in other people working with them on things, whether that be some open source project or at a company with coworkers. It was when I was reading through the advent calendar exercises for some year and realized that while I couldn&#x27;t recall half the features used to solve the problems, I had been exposed to them all multiple times before. The reason I couldn&#x27;t remember them was because there were so many ways to solve the problems, that it felt like just keeping up with the features and syntax was overwhelming, and that unless you used a very strict subset of the language, it would be near impossible to limit the effort requires to understand what you read from others, or even yourself some time previously.To many detractors of Perl, this won&#x27;t be an unfamiliar complaint, but I&#x27;ve always felt that while Perl (5) projects could easily devolve into a mess if some care wasn&#x27;t taken, it wasn&#x27;t that hard to exercise some restraint and still take advantage of the extra capabilities when more power was needed. Put another way, while there was definitely more than one way to do it, it didn&#x27;t feel like there were tens of vastly different ways of doing it that might have been sourced from random inclusions anywhere in the codebase because of numerous ways to insert entry points into every block, leaving you scratching your head when you encountered odd behavior.Now, it&#x27;s not a problem for a language to want to reside squarely in the \"this is for screwing around and trying any feature you can imagine and how they interact together\", but that&#x27;s not necessarily great when you are trying to accomplish something with someone else and you need to have a shared base of understanding to work from. The real problem is that many, many people in the Perl6&#x2F;Raku community obviously really hoped for it to take over for Perl 5 or at least be useful for projects which might have multiple people working on them, whether they be through github or for some commercial work entity with coworkers, so they could spread its use and have a reason to use it on a regular basis. I think once it became clear that it wouldn&#x27;t serve that purpose as well, many people lost interest. I know that was the case for me. I was an avid lurker on the project for well over a decade, but eventually I just couldn&#x27;t convince myself it was a good idea to use the language for anything other than small test programs to satisfy my own curiosity, and eventually not even there, since if I didn&#x27;t already have it installed the overhead for a small test was quite high.In the end I guess Raku found its niche, and it&#x27;s doing okay where it is (I assume, I&#x27;ve fallen so out of date I&#x27;m not sure), but it&#x27;s sad that it seems they had to shed a lot of their original community (as someone who identifies as part of their original community) to do so, whether that&#x27;s through any concerted effort on their own part or not. That is, I don&#x27;t think Raku changed to be what it is, I think most people eventually realized what the bundle of features that was originally proposed really means in reality, and realized it didn&#x27;t fit what they actually wanted.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;design.raku.org&#x2F;S02.html#Unspaces reply deafpolygon 4 hours agorootparentPerl used to bandy about \"TMTOWTDI\" (Tim Towdy) incessantly in those days of Perl4&#x2F;5.There&#x27;s More Than One Way To Do It reply fuzztester 3 hours agorootparentYes, and it even had a way to pronounce it, I&#x27;d read: timtowdywhich I somehow did not like, but shrug.And then Python got on the bandywagon :) with:There should only be one, preferably obvious, way to do itor such, which, in later years, seems to be not bandied about as much. reply fuzztester 1 hour agorootparentI had the wording of the Python slogan slightly wrong, above, and also remembered where I had read it - in the Zen of Python.

Turing complete type systems are an example that could be seen this way. reply no_wizard 12 hours agoprevRaku is interesting as a language indeed.I can&#x27;t get over some of the idioms, they just don&#x27;t map nicely in my head. The same reason AppleScript struck me as weird, it trys to use natural language on one hand (e.g. `my`, `say`, `sub`, `gather`) with some oddities like `@` being used for (assuming?) scoped iterations or declaring modules[0] and some other from-an-outsider byzantine syntax decisions. For instance, I can logic this out, mostly, but it would not feel intuitive to me to \"discover\":``` my @bottles = (flat ((99...2) X~ &#x27; bottles&#x27;), &#x27;1 bottle&#x27;, &#x27;no more bottles&#x27;, &#x27;99 bottles&#x27;); my @actions = (flat &#x27;Take one down and pass it around&#x27; xx 99, &#x27;Go to the store and buy some more&#x27;); for flat @bottles Z @actions Z @bottles[1..*] { say \"$^a of beer on the wall, $^a of beer. $^b, $^c of beer on the wall.\\n\".tc; } ```These idioms don&#x27;t click for me intuitively. Its a very symbol heavy language and the symbols often appear to be overloaded by context.All to say, its okay! different languages isn&#x27;t a bad thing, however I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d use Raku even if it was the best fit for something, like say, a natural language parser (which based on all evidence Perl &#x2F; Raku is really good at building parsers)[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;examples.raku.org&#x2F;categories&#x2F;module-management&#x2F;Fletc... reply BaseballPhysics 12 hours agoparentLet me guess, you were never a Perl programmer? Trust me, if you have a Perl background, a lot of that syntax looks pretty familiar (the @ sigil in particular denotes an array). reply no_wizard 12 hours agorootparentYes. Though that&#x27;s my point, to me it doesn&#x27;t feel the most welcoming to others who know another language (or languages).By all means though, if folks like it, carry on. I am sure Raku as a runtime is well engineered, I respect that.I don&#x27;t know what lineage Raku shares other than Perl, but it seems to be on its own plane if you will, and thats cool. reply petre 3 hours agorootparentCalculus also doesn&#x27;t feel welcoming for accountants. reply cassepipe 11 hours agoparentprevI actually feel the same about bash reply jpk 7 hours agorootparentWhich isn&#x27;t surprising, because Perl was originally designed to be a replacement for shell as a scripting language. So, it borrowed lots of stuff from shell scripting, and if you&#x27;ve spent lots of time in bash, awk, sed, etc, then elements of Perl (and Raku) will look very familiar. reply pie_flavor 12 hours agoprevMy favorite feature of Raku: Integer division and decimal literals both return `Rat`, a rational fraction type. Even though everyone knows floats suck, nobody is actually moving away from them except Raku. If you want a float literal you specifically have to use scientific notation. reply db48x 11 hours agoparentThere are older languages just waiting for the people who dislike IEEE 754 floats to notice them too, like Common Lisp and Scheme. They have a numeric tower which includes both rational and complex rational numbers: > (+ 5&#x2F;3 4&#x2F;5) 37&#x2F;15 > (expt #C(0 1) 2) -1 > (expt #C(3&#x2F;2 1&#x2F;2) 2) #C(2 3&#x2F;2)And of course they all support arbitrary precision numbers as well: > (complex (fact 10) (fact 20)) #C(3628800 2432902008176640000) > (&#x2F; (complex (fact 10) (fact 20)) 29) #C(3628800&#x2F;29 2432902008176640000&#x2F;29)Composition is a wonderful thing. reply moonchild 11 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s actually an awful misfeature, because those Rats will automatically turn into floats when the rational representation gets too big: > WHAT 1&#x2F;10 (Rat) > WHAT 1&#x2F;100000000000000000000 (Num)(There is FatRat, which does not so &#x27;promote&#x27;, but it is not the default.) reply librasteve 24 minutes agorootparentI disagree that graceful degradation from Rat to Num (ie double) when Real numbers over- or under-flow is a misfeature.We could (and have) debate whether FatRat should be the default, but imo the right expectation for an untyped language should be that very large or small numbers are represented with a floating point representation that (i) uses the FPU that&#x27;s right there and (ii) sacrifices precision in the mantissa for accuracy.Since Raku has (gradual) types, you can easily specify what you want and throw an error. reply lizmat 2 hours agorootparentprevNewer versions of Rakudo allow you to tune this behaviour dynamically through the $*RAT-OVERFLOW dynamic variable (which defaults to Num for the described behaviour).See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.raku.org&#x2F;language&#x2F;variables#$*RAT-OVERFLOW* reply cosmojg 11 hours agorootparentprevHa, it&#x27;s like best-effort typing. The interpreter gives you a precise rational if it can, and it throws you a float if it can&#x27;t. I suppose that, in a language as dynamic as Raku, the idea is that you should never need to keep track of types anyhow, but this might be nicer if this value ends up being your user-facing output, depending on the application. reply moonchild 11 hours agorootparentThere is no reason why it could not continue to use the exact representation and operations if it wished (and that&#x27;s what FatRat does). It&#x27;s just an ill-conceived concession to performance. reply dragonwriter 11 hours agoparentprev> My favorite feature of Raku: Integer division and decimal literals both return `Rat`, a rational fraction type. Even though everyone knows floats suck, nobody is actually moving away from them except Raku.Scheme’s numeric tower has a handled exact expressions with exact representations correctly for decades, so I guess its true that is not “moving away from” unnecessary and error-prone use of inexact floats where not explicitly requested, but only because it was never there to move away from. reply kstrauser 11 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not sure what I think about that. I know when to use decimal&#x2F;rational types vs floats, but my own Python code has a whole lot more float() calls than Decimal()s. Floats are almost always what I want unless I&#x27;m directly working with money. reply zelphirkalt 11 hours agorootparentAre they almost always what you want? Like, what kind of code do you work on? I personally find, that I need floats quite rarely and rationals usually are just fine, when I write Scheme. And when I write Python, floats also don&#x27;t come up that often, except for in places where I would rather like to have exact numbers than inexact ones, always making me doubt, whether what I calculate here might have too big error in it. reply kstrauser 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s mostly in calculating percentages, measuring timing, computing the interval to wait to satisfy a rate limit, that sort of thing. None of those require the extra overhead of an exact datatype in the contexts I&#x27;m using them. reply 59nadir 4 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s funny that you&#x27;re talking about this in a Python context, because pretty much every few lines will be 50-100x overhead. I take your point that Python would probably slow this type of thing down even more than it should, but still... Python is the exact type of language where this type of generalization to something slower but \"more correct\" makes sense in my opinion.For what it&#x27;s worth I agree with you when it comes to languages where 50+x overhead isn&#x27;t an ever-present fact; you should generally have to opt in to using decimal types and the like. reply petre 3 hours agoparentprevRacket begs to differ.

It was the PCRE standard. Everything else was following it. Usually with some piece missing--far more implementations should have the &#x2F;x modifier.The Perl 6 design process didn&#x27;t throw it away after 30 years. It threw it away with less than 10 years. There was already widespread knowledge that Perl had gone beyond \"regular expressions\", and IIRC, that was even before it had implemented recursive expressions. Perl 6 would be \"patterns\", and they would be good enough to be used as a full grammar.

Raw Unicode escapes? This seems complicated pointless to me just to save a couple characters. reply creer 1 hour agorootparentInput method: I see this as fundamentally a keyboard input method that needs to be resolved for your setup overall. Not a Raku issue. For now I&#x27;m settled on three alternate methods (under linux). The Compose key method, mostly for accented characters. The editor&#x27;s code point method, in vim Ctrl-v u or U (but you need to know the unicode code point and I don&#x27;t exactly have them memorized). Or copy and paste from some web character chart. Since this is programming and not texting emoji, I&#x27;d rather have a specific, chosen code point so I tend to use the editor&#x27;s code point input. (But wait, that&#x27;s not all, you need enough unicode support in your programming font - not very easy on linux.)What&#x27;s the point: Absolutely not saving typing. The point is to have a more visually distinctive notation. A math blackboard would be full of that. For example, in the code right in front of me I have a U+25C0 e2 97 80 BLACK LEFT-POINTING TRIANGLE as a custom infix operator for two specific data types. I could have overloaded an existing one... but no, the existing one still exists and it should be extra clear which one is used. When that code is in front of me, it&#x27;s perfectly clear which is which. And now that the symbol is there in the code, it can just be copy-pasted. (For good measure, the unicode code point is specified in the operator&#x27;s definition - but that&#x27;s not necessary in day to day editing.) reply codeflo 3 hours agorootparentprevWhen I last looked at this -- admittedly years ago at this point -- all Unicode operators had an ASCII alternative.

We’ve updated our terms of service (in section 10.4) to further confirm that we will not use audio, video, or chat customer content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent. As part of our commitment to transparency and user control, we are providing clarity on our approach to two essential aspects of our services: Zoom’s AI features and customer content sharing for product improvement purposes. Our goal is to enable Zoom account owners and administrators to have control over these features and decisions, and we’re here to shed light on how we do that and how that affects certain customer groups. Recent terms of service changes  We strive to provide transparency about data ownership in our terms of service. These terms of service work together with our privacy statement and in-product privacy notices, which in turn aim to ensure that usage of customer content is based on your consent.   We changed our terms of service in March 2023 to be more transparent about how we use and who owns the various forms of content across our platform.  In Section 10.1 (coupled with 10.6), our intention was to make clear that customers create and own their own video, audio, and chat content. We have permission to use this customer content to provide value-added services based on this content, but our customers continue to own and control their content. For example, a customer may have a webinar that they ask us to livestream on YouTube. Even if we use the customer video and audio content to livestream, they own the underlying content. Section 10.2 covers that there is certain information about how our customers in the aggregate use our product — telemetry, diagnostic data, etc. This is commonly known as service generated data. We wanted to be transparent that we consider this to be our data so that we can use service generated data to make the user experience better for everyone on our platform. For example, it is helpful to know generally what time of day in a particular region we have heavy usage so we can better balance loads in our data centers and provide better video quality for all of our users. In Section 10.4, our intention was to make sure that if we provided value-added services (such as a meeting recording), we would have the ability to do so without questions of usage rights. The meeting recording is still owned by the customer, and we have a license to that content in order to deliver the service of recording. An example of a machine learning service for which we need license and usage rights is our automated scanning of webinar invites / reminders to make sure that we aren’t unwittingly being used to spam or defraud participants. The customer owns the underlying webinar invite, and we are licensed to provide the service on top of that content.  For AI, we do not use audio, video, or chat content for training our models without customer consent. What this means for healthcare and education customers We will not use customer content, including education records or protected health information, to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.  We routinely enter into student data protection agreements with our education customers and legally required business associate agreements (BAA) with our healthcare customers. Our practices and handling of education records, pupil data, and protected healthcare data are controlled by these separate terms and applicable laws. Generative AI features We recently introduced two powerful generative AI features – Zoom IQ Meeting Summary and Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose – on a free trial basis to enhance your Zoom experience. These features offer automated meeting summaries and AI-powered chat composition. Zoom account owners and administrators control whether to enable these AI features for their accounts. When you choose to enable Zoom IQ Meeting Summary or Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose, you will also be presented with a transparent consent process for training our AI models using your customer content. Your content is used solely to improve the performance and accuracy of these AI services. And even if you chose to share your data, it will not be used for training of any third-party models.  Account owners or administrators provide consent  Here is an example of our UI through which a customer admin opts in to one of our new generative AI features.  How account owners and administrators enable and control the Zoom IQ for Meeting Summary feature and data sharing. Participants receive notice through our user interface We inform you and your meeting participants when Zoom’s generative AI services are in use. Here’s an example of how we provide in-meeting notification. A meeting participant’s view of the Meeting Summary notification once the host enables the feature. To reiterate: we do not use audio, video, or chat content for training our models without customer consent. We remain committed to transparency, and our aim is to provide you with the tools you need to make informed decisions about your Zoom account. We value your privacy and are continuously working to enhance our services while respecting your rights and preferences. Thank you for being part of the Zoom community. Together, we’ll continue to create meaningful and seamless collaboration experiences through Zoom.

It’s the PR classic do one thing say another.Edit: Oh, and then this hits almost at the same time…https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;article&#x2F;zoom-return-to-office-an... reply AndrewKemendo 9 hours agorootparent>I actually consider the act of doublespeak potentially insinuating ill intentI agree with this sentiment and it feels like a heuristic at this point.I think it comes from a decade of watching when corporate officers get caught red handed then try and denial of service the bad press with their jingoistic pablum. reply dietr1ch 4 hours agorootparentprevThis doublespeak should result in huge fines, but there&#x27;s lobbying instead reply robertlagrant 3 hours agorootparentAnd corrupt officials that accept the lobbying, which is the bad bit. reply alpaca128 2 hours agorootparent\"It&#x27;s not corruption, it&#x27;s lobbying\", the \"it&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s a feature\" of politics. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentWell, the practice of being able to take your case to the government is a great one. The government - already paid for with free money from non-government people working - is the one letting itself be corruptable. replyAnimats 12 hours agorootparentprevThe AI part isn&#x27;t the bad part. It&#x27;s the \"use for marketing\", like gMail.One implication is that lawyers can no longer use Zoom for anything which is attorney-client privileged. reply jonplackett 12 hours agorootparentHow does this add up with E2EE?They claim they can’t read anything passing through the server. Is there some other way they’ll get access?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.zoom.us&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360048660871-End-t.... reply bananapub 30 minutes agorootparente2ee is not the default, and is incompatible with some of their other features like \"cloud recordings\".they also got caught being malicious and&#x2F;or dumb in the past (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;china-zoom-data-2020-4) so there&#x27;s no reason to bother with them now. reply thesimon 11 hours agorootparentprevE2EE is not the default mode for Zoom. reply 14 12 hours agorootparentprevI have not had a chance to read up on this yet but does zoom not have a paid version or corporate version that would not follow under these same TOS? If not it seems crazy like a shot in the foot because lots of businesses use zoom and I know most want or are required to use privacy preserving programs. reply haldujai 8 hours agorootparentprevSpeaking of pinky promises:> We will not use ... protected health information, to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.> We routinely enter into ... legally required business associate agreements (BAA) with our healthcare customers. Our practices and handling of ... protected healthcare data are controlled by these separate terms and applicable laws.To my understanding there is nothing in the separate terms (BAA) or applicable laws (HIPAA) that actually guarantees this.I don&#x27;t want to assume malice but if in good faith I would have expected an updated BAA with an explicit declaration regarding data access and disclosure in a legally-binding fashion rather than a promissory blogpost vaguely referencing laws that don&#x27;t themselves inherently restrict the use of PHI for training by Zoom.It would really only require a single term. reply petesergeant 5 hours agorootparentThey have added:> Notwithstanding the above, Zoom will not use audio, video or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent. reply haldujai 4 hours agorootparentThe BAA (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explore.zoom.us&#x2F;docs&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;baa.html) looks the same. Did you mean to the TOS (which is subject to change as has now happened twice)?The BAA still states: Zoom shall not Use and&#x2F;or Disclose the Protected Health Information except as otherwise limited in this Agreement ... for the proper management and administration of Zoom ... Zoom will only use the minimum necessary Protected Health information necessary for the proper management and administration of Zoom’s business specific purposesAs discussed in my comments on yesterday&#x27;s post \"proper management and administration\" is vague language copied from HHS and can be construed as improving products as described in a legal analysis I quoted. I would also hazard a guess that a provider signing this agreement could be construed to have implied consent.Nevertheless, it would not be hard to explicitly state that this does not include training models in the only truly legally binding agreement at play. An explicit declaration was also recommended in said legal analysis. reply robertlagrant 3 hours agorootparentFor me, that BAA doc flashes up and immediately redirects me to the homepage. reply haldujai 2 hours agorootparentStrange, only seems to be happening to me on mobile.This should work: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230808072418&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explore.z... reply Jare 4 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t the TOS already count as consent? reply checkyoursudo 20 minutes agorootparentThat is where I am stuck.Until the TOS clearly says otherwise, as far as I can see, the TOS at least implies this:1. We will not use your data to train AI without your consent.2. By accepting these TOS, you give your consent to everything in this long list (which includes training AI). reply reilly3000 12 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if a deceptive marketing post explaining a privacy policy change could be considered material if there was a lawsuit. reply j16sdiz 5 hours agorootparentI wonder if you could found out when they violate their own terms. reply proxiful-wash 8 hours agorootparentprevExactly the point of my last comment no one will ever use this service again. Taking a hard NO on this forever. reply mplewis 15 hours agoparentprevThe TOS has been updated to state the following:> Notwithstanding the above, Zoom will not use audio, video or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent. reply dr_monster 15 hours agorootparentApparently the TOS can be edited at any time to say anything without notice.It’s worth mentioning that per this agreement they can still do almost anything else with that data. They could put your face up on a billboard if they wanted to.I’m out. I was a paying user. Can’t run fast enough from ever doing business with them again. reply nwoli 14 hours agorootparentPer the agreement using the service can probably be considered consent. Ie “we won’t use your data without your consent” translates to legal code “if you accept the TOS which you do if you use the app, then you’ve given consent” reply fragmede 12 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately it&#x27;s like Gmail. Even if I&#x27;m not using them, enough other places do that it&#x27;s not feasible to totally avoid them without adding complications to my life. Those complications might be worth it to you, but eg my therapist&#x27;s office uses Zoom for the backend of their app. You&#x27;d never know it unless you&#x27;re the kind of person to dig into that. reply sleepybrett 14 hours agorootparentprevHow about analyze all the meetings from company x in order to insider trade or perform some other kind of corporate sabatoge. reply nomel 11 hours agorootparent> or perform some other kind of corporate sabatoge.Webex seems to be the \"corporate\" video conference service, when secrets are a concern, from my experience. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentprev> Apparently the TOS can be edited at any time to say anything without notice.Yes, as with most terms of service. It&#x27;s one of the things that makes terms of service statements unreliable. reply esperent 3 hours agorootparentThis is not true. At least in the US you are required to notify customers when you change the terms of service, and as far as I know in the EU as well. reply gnfargbl 14 hours agorootparentprevWhich provider will you be moving to, and have you checked that their ToS are more acceptable? reply aftbit 12 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t need the \"advanced\" zoom features, I can highly recommend Jitsi. Free public service and you can self-host if you need it. We have been running a fully remote company with 90% of meetings via Jitsi since COVID with great success. I recommend Chrome over Firefox though, as FF&#x27;s WebRTC support is behind Google&#x27;s. reply cudgy 3 hours agorootparentDoesn’t using a Google product taint the solution, if privacy is a major concern? Also, WebRTC leaks ip addresses when using a VPN.What is the secure way to video conference? Webex? FaceTime offers end to end encryption, but can not easily share non-mac os screens.Articles like this sure make me like Apple sometimeshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;20&#x2F;apple-imessage-facetime-remov... reply freedude 13 hours agorootparentprevjitsihttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;meet.jit.si&#x2F; reply Simorgh 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is the question!

Only being slightly paranoid here, but they could still analyze all of the audio for nefarious reasons (insider trading, identifying monetizable medical information from doctor&#x27;s on Zoom, etc). Think of the marketing data they could generate for B2B products because they get to \"listen\" and \"watch\" every single meeting at a huge swath of companies. They&#x27;ll know whether people gripe more about Jira than Asana or Azure Devops, and what they complain about. reply btown 13 hours agorootparentThis is really important, and I would further emphasize the word our. Zoom doesn&#x27;t need permission to \"train\" their own in-house artificial intelligence model when it can just transmit&#x2F;sublicense that data to someone else who will train a model, or to an internal team who will use it (perhaps in few-shot prompts at scale, which is not technically training a model!) for \"consulting services\" in the broadest sense that that team can imagine.I generally feel like the general slowdown of capital availability in our industry will lead&#x2F;is leading to companies doing a lot more desperate things with data than they&#x27;ve ever done before. If a management team doesn&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll survive a bad couple of quarters (or that they won&#x27;t hit performance cliffs that let them keep their jobs or bonuses), all of a sudden there&#x27;s less weight placed on the long-term trust of customers and more on \"what can we do that is permissible by our contract language, even if we lose some customers because of it.\" That&#x27;s the moment when a slippery ethical slope comes into play for previously trustworthy companies. So any expansion of a TOS in today&#x27;s age should be evaluated closely. reply bonestamp2 12 hours agorootparent> If a management team doesn&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll survive a bad couple of quarters (or that they won&#x27;t hit performance cliffs that let them keep their jobs or bonuses)Agreed, and these kinds of short-term incentives are one of the problems with American companies. On the flip side...Japanese companies think about products in decades -- the product line has to make money 10 years from now.Some old European brands think about their brand in centuries -- this product made today has to be made with a process and materials that will make people in 100 years think that we made our products at the highest quality that was available to us at the time. reply ukuina 6 hours agorootparentThis is overly broad generalization that does not hold up to scrutiny.Konami vs Kojima and any of the DieselGate companies come to mind. reply callalex 12 hours agorootparentprevGot any data to back this up or are you just spouting racist tropes? reply hobo_in_library 11 hours agorootparentMaking generalized claims about companies is racist now? I must&#x27;ve missed the memo.I guess it makes sense. Companies are people, after all reply tremon 46 minutes agorootparentThey&#x27;re not making claims about companies, they&#x27;re making claims about cultures (American, European, Japanese). replynatch 9 hours agorootparentprevBut don’t overlook how easy it is for them to bury obtaining consent in a 40 page agreement. It almost makes the things you highlighted moot. reply singleshot_ 13 hours agorootparentprevA very powerful example of the difference between the words “will” and “shall.”Hats off to zoom for the free contract drafting lesson![edit: thanks to HN commenter lolinder for the actual lesson]. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparent> You can use \"will\" to create a promise--a contractual obligation. See Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 941-942 (2d ed., Oxford U. Press 1995). When used in this way, \"will\" is not merely stating a future event, it is creating a promise to perform:> > Landlord will clean and maintain all common areas.> In most basic contracts, I recommend using \"will\" to create obligations, as long as you are careful to be sure any given usage can&#x27;t be read as merely describing future events. I&#x27;m generally against \"shall\" because it is harder to use correctly and it is archaic.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.utexas.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;wschiess&#x2F;legalwriting&#x2F;2005&#x2F;05... reply singleshot_ 12 hours agorootparentSo, I get that you’re downvoting and contradicting, but are you sure we don’t agree? Let’s put it this way: I was observing precisely what you copied and pasted: this is a perfectly valid way to write a contract if you subsequently want to be able to argue either side.Was zoom careful to be sure any usage can’t be read as merely describing future events? Will ambiguity exist until this agreement is tested ? reply lolinder 12 hours agorootparentGiven that they use \"Zoom will\" 21 times in the document to clearly refer to their obligations—including 4 times in the paragraph entitled \"10.5 Our Obligations Over Your Customer Content\"—I seriously doubt they&#x27;re counting on or will get points for any ambiguity.Meanwhile not once do they use \"Zoom shall\". It&#x27;s pretty clearly just a stylistic choice and not anything sneaky.Edit: They even use \"will\" in the all-important phrase \"you will pay Zoom\". Surely you don&#x27;t think they meant to be sneaky in that usage, and that is merely meant as a prediction of future events? reply singleshot_ 12 hours agorootparentI stand corrected. I suppose reading the contract instead of snarking might have allowed me to avoid the embarrassment. Thank you. reply lolinder 11 hours agorootparentThanks for responding graciously! reply singleshot_ 10 hours agorootparentWhen in Rome; you as well. replylittlestymaar 14 hours agorootparentprev> without your consent.†but we&#x27;ll prompt you an overly long privacy policy including such consent whose acceptation is just a checkbox you tick the first time your join a call without even paying attention (nor choice) reply dghlsakjg 14 hours agorootparentThis seems to be a pretty big thing. Zoom seems to have been adopted by a lot of government processes.How does this apply for court hearings, council meetings, etc… reply StevenXC 13 hours agorootparentZoomGov likely has a different ToS reply fbdab103 6 hours agorootparentprevDoes that mean they could sell the data and let someone else train their AI model without consent? reply stefan_ 14 hours agorootparentprevThat still allows them to broadcast your meeting in a feature film of their choice. No, this is insane. The only reasonable option here is (1) end-to-end encryption or (2) ephemeral storage purely for the provision of the service. reply wodenokoto 4 hours agoparentprevIf my hours of watching legal eagle on YouTube qualifies me to give legal advice for a country I don’t even live in then yes, that marketing statement can have very real influence on how a court is willing to interpret the agreement between Zoom and its users. reply mikro2nd 3 hours agoparentprevFunny how people have been granting pretty much the same batch of rights to Microsoft for decades when they used Skype, and nobody minded.In addition Skype&#x27;s ToS granted MS a licence to any and all IP you might discuss during a Skype call.[1] I wonder why no businesses were bothered by that...?[1] ...decades ago, I don&#x27;t know how it reads now, can&#x27;t be arsed to check. reply gmerc 2 hours agorootparentTimes have changed.

Otherwise can&#x27;t they just change it in the website UI...? They don&#x27;t promise any particular process for acquiring consent, but sure declare you give it to them for many many other things. reply cbsmith 10 hours agoparentprevThe marketing piece explains why you might want them to let them have these rights. The TOS are what you&#x27;re giving up in exchange. reply happytiger 11 hours agoparentprevWe can drop them from all of our portfolio companies and I personally can as well.But what are the best alternatives at the moment?Zoom is very popular… reply willsmith72 11 hours agorootparentI find google meet pretty good.

Meet performs better in the browser for me reply nightpool 11 hours agorootparentEvery time I try to use Meet in an up to date Google Chrome MacBook, it makes my entire browser stutter. And it&#x27;s much worse than the Zoom desktop client when it comes to audio cancelling and visual quality reply robertlagrant 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you use Slack their video calling is pretty good these days, at least for internal calls. reply raverbashing 2 hours agoparentprevThey have amended the TOS with this statement:> Notwithstanding the above, Zoom will not use audio, video or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent. reply walrus01 8 hours agoparentprev> but the TOS is the important part,You think a TOS that&#x27;s biased towards the company, or the customer, has any legal effect on a Chinese domestic corporation that&#x27;s subject to the laws and regulations of the Ministry of State Security? Really? reply autoexec 12 hours agoprevZoom was proved as being dishonest and untrustworthy years ago (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;citizenlab.ca&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto...) but companies never cared about the privacy of the people they forced to use the software and all the security problems and leaks that followed still didn&#x27;t discourage people from using it. I doubt their mining of personal data for AI will stop people from using it either.Although there are a ton of alternatives out there they are all \"too hard\" or something, so since Zoom mostly works OK most of the time and is dead simple to use it will continue to win out over everything else.My position on Zoom hasn&#x27;t changed since 2020: Anyone using Zoom will continue to get exactly what they deserve. reply chefandy 11 hours agoparent> they are all \"too hard\" or somethingUsers vote with their feet based on cost and UX. While intertia is certainly a thing, there&#x27;s a reason Zoom got a foothold while others didn&#x27;t. The ability to send out links and having people join the meeting without creating accounts or manually installing clients first is huge in most real-world scenarios. Could you do that with... Teams? Skype? Hangouts if they weren&#x27;t gmail users? Do those people know anyone with the knowledge and gumption to host something?From the beginning of my involvement in FOSS like 25 years ago, developers have griped about non-technical users being intimidated, or even just really annoyed by UX resistance that we consider trivial. That&#x27;s the primary reasons open source alternatives are alternatives rather than the standard in user-facing software. reply rolph 9 hours agorootparent[The ability to send out links and having people join the meeting without creating accounts or manually installing clients first is huge in most real-world scenarios ]this is how it used to be, until HTTPS and cloudflare-like hosting solutions, were guzzled back like electric kool-aid. all you really needed was an IP and perhaps a port number if endpoint was behind NAT. reply chefandy 6 hours agorootparentI worked in technical support when techniques like that were de rigeur. Your average adult would be exponentially less likely to navigate that process successfully than a zoom invite. Sure, it&#x27;s more simple from a technical perspective, but not even close to as simple from a user flow standpoint. reply ChrisMarshallNY 11 hours agoparentprevWell, there&#x27;s a couple of reasons that people use it:1) Until recently, Zoom&#x27;s video&#x2F;audio quality knocked everyone else&#x27;s into a cocked hat. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case, anymore. Looks like a lot of folks got off their butts, and improved their quality, but I haven&#x27;t seen this mentioned anywhere, by anyone.2) Everyone else is using it.#2 is a biggie. Monopoly inertia is pretty hard to overcome, for people not in the tech industry (we&#x27;ll change on a whim).Zoom is not easy to use. Its settings are a mess, but everyone is used to dealing with the Zoom pain, and don&#x27;t want to switch.We can be remarkably cavalier in dismissing non-tech folks, but I learned to stop doing that, many years ago. We&#x27;re not the only smart people in the world.People (in general) don&#x27;t like getting sidetracked by their tools. They want to get a job done, and how they get it done is not irrelevant, but not that important to them. They develop and refine a workflow, which is usually heavily informed by their choice of tools, and that \"wears a groove.\" They don&#x27;t want to switch grooves; even if they are not enjoying their tool.Most tech folks, on the other hand love tools. I had an employee that would stop his main project, and design a massive subsystem, just to make a simple command-line process a few seconds shorter. I had to keep on my toes. He was the best engineer I&#x27;ve ever worked with, but it was a chore to keep him focused.Non-tech types are seldom like that, and we can sometimes miss it.These are the folks that use our products, and we don&#x27;t actually gain anything by disrespecting them, even when they really piss us off.TL;DR: Want people to stop using Zoom? Produce something better, and make it something that non-tech folks will love.That means easy to use, forget-about-it UX, and extremely high quality. reply nightpool 11 hours agorootparentWhat video platforms do you think improved their audio quality to be comparable to Zoom? Meet certainly hasn&#x27;t, their noise cancelling is awful and isn&#x27;t going to get better as long as they&#x27;re stuck in the browser. (I&#x27;m fine with browser performance 99% of the time, but when I&#x27;m spending hours a day on calls I&#x27;m going to prefer Zoom and native-quality audio processing) reply macNchz 8 hours agorootparentFor some reason noise cancellation in Meet is gated by the tier of Google Workspace you’re on, it’s available on the $12&#x2F;mo&#x2F;user plan, but not on the $6 one.This has always struck me as a weird business&#x2F;product choice, since I imagine most users simply don’t know about this, assume Meet is just bad, and use other products, rather than having the idea to upgrade for better audio quality. reply ChrisMarshallNY 9 hours agorootparentprevI never liked Meet.I was thinking of Bluejeans and Teams. GoToMeeting seems to have improved a lot, as well. WebEx is doing much better, but I have only used Bluejeans and Teams, in the last couple of years. reply jen20 7 hours agorootparentprevWebEx certainly is. reply andreyvit 3 hours agorootparentprevNot to mention other super-important features like background blurring. It has very recently become available with in-browser solutions, but still not exactly on par, and with less options (e.g. no green screen support). That alone justifies using Zoom. reply walrus01 8 hours agoparentprevLet&#x27;s also not forget that Zoom&#x27;s internal processes and engineering standards for security were so poor that Apple implemented the rarely-used malware removal tool, because they screwed up their client software so badly:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-silent-update-zoom-a...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;7&#x2F;10&#x2F;20689644&#x2F;apple-zoom-web-s...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-update-remove-zoo... reply sean_hogle 12 hours agoprevZoom&#x27;s lawyers are trying to pull a fast one with these revised Terms. The new sentence on user consent being required to train AIs applies only to \"Customer Content,\" not \"Service Generated Data.\"In sec. 10.4, Zoom says \"... Zoom will not use audio, video or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.\"Customer Content is defined in 10.1 and is broadly worded. But the first sentence of sec. 10.2 clearly states that \"Customer Content\" does NOT include \"Service Generated Data.\"Therein lies the rub. \"Service Generated Data\" = \"any telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects or generates in connection with your or your End Users’ use of the Services ....\" (sec. 10.2).Zoom is allowed to use Service Generated Data for any purpose (sec. 10.2) because it is not \"Customer Content.\"This \"clarification\" does nothing meaningful to assuage the serious data privacy concerns posed by Zoom&#x27;s use of captured user video content. reply slt2021 11 hours agoparentare Embeddings (text-emb, visual-emb, etc) of Customer Content service generated data?This might be a loophole Zoom is trying to use - while they technically not using customer data (Zoom client not sending video stream to train AI), but zoom client can process data locally and send only embeddings (numeric vectors without ties to customer PII data) and it still will be customer data reply gruez 16 hours agoprevCalled it a few days ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37022827It&#x27;s baffling how many people in previous threads thought a company that gets most of its money from enterprise&#x2F;business clients, will burn all their reputation by surreptitiously using client data to train their AI. reply tailspin2019 15 hours agoparentGiven the company’s history, it doesn’t seem very baffling at all…> Zoom has agreed to pay $85 million to settle claims that it lied about offering end-to-end encryption and gave user data to Facebook and Google without the consent of users.

He made it, sending Michael Jordan and the Bulls into an all-out frenzy that he had won $1 million. Or so everybody thought. Illustration by Rafa Alvarez Ryan Hockensmith Apr 11, 2023, 08:00 AM ET Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email print RIGHT BEFORE HE HEAVED the million-dollar shot, the one that would launch an era of sports contests and change his life forever, Don Calhoun took a long look at his shoes. He was only out here standing on the floor of Chicago Stadium on April 14, 1993, 15 feet from Michael Jordan and the Bulls, because of his shoes. \"Those won't scuff the court,\" an arena worker said as she signed Calhoun up for a $1 million, three-quarter-court contest shot that the Bulls had been running every night. As he stared at his feet, waiting to be told it was his turn to take the shot, he was warned, \"Whatever you do, don't step over the free throw line.\" Calhoun, a 23-year-old office supply salesman from the Chicago area, darted his eyes from his non-scuffing sneakers to the free throw line about 80 feet from the hoop he needed to make. The impossibility of the shot was settling in. He wasn't going to be able to shoot it with both hands; he'd have to throw it like a quarterback. The Bulls had held the promotion 19 times that year already. Two people clunked the backboard. Another clanged the rim. The other 16 were air balls. Nobody came close. The best estimate of someone like Calhoun making that shot? Less than 1%. But then, a calm came over him. He thought about his brother Clarence, who had told him five years earlier, just before he died, that Michael Jordan would soon be the best player in the NBA and the Bulls would be a dynasty. He thought about his bittersweet feelings toward the sport of basketball -- he loved the game and was good at it, but he never made his high school team. It might sound ridiculous, but as Calhoun stood there and heard his name announced, he became sure -- 100% certain -- that the shot was going to go in. The last thing he remembers is the steady hum of 18,600 people rising to cheer for him. As the Bulls huddled up nearby, Calhoun palmed the ball in one hand. The free throw line warning was bouncing around inside his head, and for a second, he felt his flow get disrupted. But the flow came back as he stepped past the end line. He took one fast dribble, thought to himself, \"This is for Clarence,\" and then threw a high-arching rocket. As the ball sailed toward the hoop, Calhoun's eyes again turned toward his feet and he saw that he was very close to the free throw line -- but a few inches behind. Whew. When he looked up again, he had a moment of panic. He'd thrown it too far and too hard. \"It looked like it was going to hit the shot clock,\" he says. But then the ball began to sink. It dropped, and dropped, and dropped, and... swish. Right through the net. Calhoun threw his arms toward the rafters, and the crowd let out one of those levels of cheers that aggravates the arena neighbors. Then the real mayhem began. The ensuing 30 seconds might be the most joyous footage of that Bulls team ever. Seriously, watch the most celebratory moments from \"The Last Dance,\" and compare those with the clips you will inevitably see this April 14 on social media on the 30th anniversary of Calhoun's heave. John Paxson and Scott Williams go wild. Some player just off-camera slaps Calhoun's ass over and over again, and even one of the game refs comes over, hits him on the back and hands him the ball from the shot. Phil Jackson stands there with an incredulous grin, looking like he just won the $1 million. Suddenly, Calhoun found himself bumped and butt-slapped directly into the middle of the Bulls huddle, where the other players parted and there stood Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan. Calhoun was the team's 13th man at that moment. Calhoun was in there for a good 10 seconds when he felt Jordan slap him on the back and lean into his ear. \"Great shot, kid,\" Jordan said. Calhoun says he can still hear the way Jordan was yelling \"Woo!\" behind him the entire time. After the game, Michael Wilbon, then at The Washington Post, wrote, \"Jordan, smiling in a child-like way I've never seen on the court, threw both arms around his neck and squeezed.\" As the celebration exploded around him, Calhoun felt as if his life was going to change. He was the toast of Chicago for the next 24 hours, with the shot going viral by 1993 standards, with newscasts and newspapers all showing the clip so much that Calhoun's shot is now referenced as the beginning of a boom in contests at sporting events. And best of all, Calhoun was about to become a millionaire. Or so he thought. play 1:05 Flashback: Bulls fan drains $1 million shot in 1993 Don Calhoun sinks a three-quarter-court shot for $1 million on April 14, 1993. BY THE TIME DON CALHOUN made his shot, in-game contests had begun to pop up here and there across the country. But Calhoun's make caused an eruption in popularity. Chris Hamman, VP at industry leader SCA Promotions, thinks \"The Calhoun Shot,\" as it's become known in the business, might have doubled or even tripled the number of contests. \"These types of contests grew quite a bit, and a lot of NBA teams started doing similar contests,\" says Hamman, whose dad, Bob, founded SCA Promotions, which has been insuring sports contests since the mid-1980s. Chris compares Calhoun's make with the impact Chris Moneymaker had on poker in 2003 when he went from an $86 online qualifier to winning the World Series of Poker (and $2.5 million). The contests took off afterward. They were the perfect way to keep 15,000-plus people engaged during TV timeouts and between quarters. They were wildly popular crowd-pleasers back then, and remain slam dunk #ViralContent in the social media era. SCA Promotions has insured billions of dollars of sports contests since the mid-1980s, paying out something like $250 million in winnings over the years, according to Bob Hamman. (SCA was not the insurer of the Calhoun Shot). As the Hammans note, the perfect contest is like the most tempting carnival game: just feasible enough to make people think they can do it while actually being extremely difficult. Everybody at the Bulls game that night in 1993 probably had sunk a long shot or two at some point in their life. In reality, Jordan himself might not have made one if you gave him 100 tries. \"With the shot that Don Calhoun made, you could have Steph Curry out there and still make money,\" Chris Hamman says. But, as was the case with Calhoun, people do win enough to keep contest dreams alive. SCA Promotions insures more than $100 million in sports contests every year, and the Hammans love telling stories of paying off winners ... because the vast majority of holes-in-one and half-court shots never happen. It's a little like when sportsbooks leak out those betting slips of the fan who hit a 12-team parlay that cost $40 and pays out $250,000. The good news fuels the delusion of it happening to you. One of the Hammans' favorite winners was a Diamondbacks fan, Gylene Hoyle, who won a 1999 radio contest where she had to pick one Arizona player and an inning. If that player hit a home run in that exact inning during a specific game, she'd win $1 million. Seems doable, right? The math is actually obscene. She picked Jay Bell, who was in the middle of a monster year (38 home runs and 112 RBIs). She had about a 1-in-2,916 chance. And yet, Bell came to the plate in the sixth inning with the bases loaded. He fouled off two straight two-strike pitches, then hit a home run on a pitch that could have been ball four. Afterward, he acknowledged that he knew about the contest and swung hoping to get someone $1 million. \"That one stung,\" Bob Hamman says. The math on insuring high-stakes contests generally works the same way. Brokers come up with a likelihood that a random contestant could win -- the Hammans say a three-quarter-court shot is less than 1%, for example -- and divide it into the prize amount, then charge about twice that to insure it. For a $1 million contest with a 1% success rate, that means it'd cost the team $20,000 every time they run it. Once the details are ironed out, insurance companies come up with all the fine print. Contestants usually must be randomly selected from the crowd. If it's one shot, there's no warmup toss or second attempt. If it's three makes in 30 seconds, three makes in 30.1 seconds is close but no money. For something like a hockey shot that must go through a tiny plywood cutout and into a goal, the shot has to be entirely through. Not mostly through. Not on the line. Entirely through. Insurance companies are unforgiving with teams that don't explain the rules right, and it's not unusual for franchises to end up paying out the contest themselves if there are any issues. The PR hit of stiffing a middle school geometry teacher out of $25,000 generally isn't worth it. But lawsuits and disagreements happen, and that's what almost happened to Don Calhoun. One key stipulation in most insurance policies is that the contestant can't have played an \"organized\" version of the sport in question for a certain time period before the contest -- usually, five years. Calhoun grew up in Chicago playing hoops on the playground with Clarence. Both had trouble making it onto junior high and varsity teams despite what seemed to be a worthy skill set. They were tough guards who loved dogging opposing ball handlers on defense. But they also played a brand of streetball that didn't always translate well to high school hoops. They certainly had talent, though. Clarence graduated and played at a junior college for his freshman year, then transferred to DePaul to walk onto the basketball team as a sophomore. Don, then a senior in high school, drew inspiration from Clarence's unwillingness to quit basketball despite a high school career that didn't pan out -- he, too, planned to go to a small school to play hoops before transferring to a bigger school. But one weekend, Clarence was on his way home from school to hang out with his family for a few days when the Calhouns got a dreaded phone call. He had gotten tired on the drive home, pulled over to rest, and been struck and killed by another car. He was 20. Don was devastated. He didn't graduate that spring on time as he grieved. But he went back to school in the fall and got his diploma. He slowly landed in a headspace where he wanted to use his brother's memory as fuel. He bounced around at two community colleges and walked on with both basketball teams. One newspaper account from the time says he was 3-for-12 shooting in 11 career games. But Don eventually walked away from school and from any formal basketball. He found out his longtime girlfriend was pregnant, so he got a job as an office supply salesman. Binders, notebooks, day planners, you name it, Don Calhoun was the guy to talk to. He was making a decent living, and he eventually had a son. The little boy's name? Clarence Calhoun II. When Clarence was 3, Don hugged him and told him to watch the Bulls game that night because Dad might be on TV. Clarence remembers his mom letting him stay up, although he's not sure he saw the actual shot. He just recalls yelling and pointing at the screen as he watched his dad leap up and down with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Then he went to bed. Calhoun says that he marked on the forms that he had played some college basketball three years earlier and that the contest people shrugged about it. The insurance company disagreed, and the weekend after he had won, local news media began to report that Calhoun might not be getting the money. That prompted the Bulls to hold a news conference, where Calhoun sat beside Jerry Reinsdorf and several contest sponsors. \"It is unclear at this time whether the company that insured the event will pay on the policy,\" a joint statement read. \"However, regardless of its decision, [restaurant group] Lettuce Entertain You, Coca-Cola (Foundation) and the Chicago Bulls will honor the $1 million award and ensure that this event has a happy ending.\" Calhoun left that day knowing that the win was, in fact, going to be a win. He would immediately receive his first of 20 annual $50,000 payments. In the coming weeks, he appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and got a cup of coffee as a member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He was, unbelievably, the unofficial mayor of Chicago for a brief period. When Wilbon called Calhoun's company for his story, someone answered by saying, \"Reliable Office Superstore. This is the home of one-shot Don Calhoun, the million-dollar man.\" He never got many details about how the sponsors and insurance company worked it out. He just took yes as an answer. It wasn't until a few weeks later that he found out that he might have needed a key assist from a secret source: Michael Jordan himself. Michael Jordan looks to drive against Kevin Johnson in Game 6 of the 1993 NBA Finals. Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty Images AFTER CALHOUN made the shot, he was asked to stay on the floor and do an endless string of TV hits and print interviews. As he bounced from camera setup to camera setup near the Chicago locker room, Bulls players kept leaving and spotting him on their way out. Almost every player came over, said congratulations and signed his basketball. \"It took me three years to make a million dollars, and it took him five seconds,\" Horace Grant joked afterward. Calhoun got signatures from Grant, Scottie Pippen, John Paxson and B.J. Armstrong, plus two Heat players who swung by, Rony Seikaly and Steve Smith. And then, as he got ready to do another live hit, Calhoun saw Jordan and a Bulls staffer come out and stand nearby. Calhoun made eye contact with Jordan, who smiled back at him and was clearly there waiting to say hello to him. Calhoun wanted to run over and ditch whatever TV interview he was about to do, but producers kept telling him they were about to go live any second now. When the lights went on, Calhoun did the best interview he could as he watched in dismay what was happening on the other side of the camera. Jordan said something to the Bulls staffer and left. Calhoun wasn't going to meet MJ, after all, and it crushed him. The Bulls worker said he could leave the ball behind and they'd try to get Jordan to sign it. But Calhoun had other plans. He didn't want to leave the building without that ball, so he took it. He thought there was a chance he might run into Jordan somewhere down the road, then he could get an autograph. Over the next few days, news broke all over the country that Calhoun's winnings seemed to be in jeopardy. Calhoun clung to that ball, and it provided him hope. He had made the shot. The crowd had gone completely wild. The Bulls had pulled him into their huddle. He had left with the ball. That was all real, and he would have it forever. The $1 million? He sure hoped it was coming his way. But he also felt an odd peace about the money. The experience alone certainly wouldn't pay for Clarence's school clothes. But it wasn't nothing, either. It was priceless. As reports swirled, fan outrage was palpable in Chicago, which created enough heat on the franchise to figure out some way to pay the local office supply salesman his damn money. That led to the news conference and the first $50,000 check. But what to do about his beloved basketball? The next school year, he had heard from a friend that Jordan always attended one of his kid's home games at a specific school in the area. So he showed up that night -- with his ball and two magazines -- and tried to walk up to Jordan. The Bulls star had his own section away from the crowd, complete with security that kept people from doing exactly what Calhoun was trying to do. Calhoun was stopped on his approach by a Jordan security guy, who said Jordan had a firm policy of no autographs at his kids' events. Calhoun explained who he was and that Jordan had seemed to really want to meet him back in April. The security guy wouldn't budge. \"No autographs at his kids' stuff,\" the guy repeated. But Calhoun had a funny feeling that he shouldn't give up. He asked the security to pretty-pretty-pretty please tell Jordan that the guy who made The Calhoun Shot had come to the game hoping for his signature. The security guy shook his head. Calhoun was even willing to just hand the guy the ball to take to Jordan. No luck. \"Michael doesn't do anything when he's at one of his kid's games,\" Calhoun was told. An unlikely thing happened near the end of the game, though. The security guard came to Calhoun in the stands and told him he could walk with Jordan to his car after the game. So Calhoun got his ball and Sharpie ready, then met up with the Jordan crew as he left the high school. The first thing out of Jordan's mouth? \"Did you get your money?\" Jordan asked. Calhoun said yes, and Jordan told him something that caught him off guard. \"We made them give it to you,\" Jordan said. \"We were upset that they were trying to not pay you.\" Calhoun was stunned. He had heard rumors that the Bulls players were agitated at the thought of him getting stiffed. But this was confirmation that Michael Jordan himself helped make him a millionaire. (Jordan declined an interview request for this story; the Bulls also passed on participating.) As they got to a set of doors, Calhoun knew Jordan's car was waiting for him on the other side. He asked whether Jordan would sign his ball, and MJ said no, that he had to stick to his principle of no autographs at his kids' stuff. \"Bring it down to my steakhouse and drop it off, then I'll sign it,\" he said. Calhoun waved goodbye that night and thanked Jordan once more for advocating on his behalf. But as he left later, he felt a pang as he considered just pulling up to Jordan's restaurant, dropping off the ball and hoping for the best. The ball had grown to mean so much to him. It wasn't the signatures, or that he thought the ball might be worth something like $20,000. Its actual worth was beyond what someone could pay. It represented the agony of losing Clarence and trying to carry his brother's message with his own son. It represented the end of the bitter, unfulfilled taste that \"organized\" basketball had left in his mouth. It represented closing that chapter of his life when he had to fight and claw to pay every bill for his family, opening up 20 years where he knew he had a financial backstop each year. Was he really going to hand the ball to some random steakhouse assistant manager and cross his fingers, hoping he'd see it again? The answer was... yes, he was going to do exactly that. He felt as if Jordan's signature was too important as the coda to the story of the ball. So he drove over there one day and implored the person he handed it to for help, saying that this ball meant so much to him, that MJ's signature was the last missing component of an artifact from the most important moment of his life. It must have worked. A few weeks later, he got a call to pick up the ball. \"Michael signed it, and he wishes you well,\" Calhoun was told. The ball became a family heirloom over the next three decades. But not in the way you'd expect. Calhoun never locked it up in a vault or even put it in a protective case in the house. He left it in the basement of his house, and Clarence and Calhoun's other three kids would dribble it and throw it around. He wanted his kids to be able to touch and feel something that had altered the trajectory of their family. \"I'll always keep it for you,\" Don told Clarence. For the next 20 years, Calhoun would get a check for $50,000 every year. Of that money, he'd have to set aside around $12,000 for taxes. He kept his office sales job for a few more years, and the other $38,000 (about $79,000 in 2023 dollars) was a very nice supplemental living. But, as Calhoun says, it was more like a bump up within the middle class. \"In reality, you're not rich,\" he says. \"You're not a millionaire.\" Maybe he didn't have generational wealth. But he was about to experience a generational breakthrough. AS THE 30th ANNIVERSARY of the shot approaches, Calhoun takes a few weeks to decide whether he will talk about the shot, the money or any of it. He hasn't done many interviews over the years. Eventually, he agreed to one but asked that his current location and occupation be left out of the story. Let's say he's living within a few hours of Chicago in the Midwest, and he works the second shift at a solid job. He's not hesitant because he's a particularly shy person -- once he gets rolling on the phone, he's funny and unafraid to argue, and he comes off as very open and honest as he talks. Toward the end of an hourlong interview, he asks, \"How can I get to the Hall of Fame?\" When the answer is a surprised chuckle, he says, \"Don't you laugh. I want to be in the Hall of Fame. I think I deserve it.\" He seems to be goofing around, but Calhoun changes lanes easily between being confident and reserved. He talks about the shot like he knew it was going in the entire time, yet it never sounds particularly braggy. He seems as if he had his 15 minutes and is content with that ... but also thinks it'd be nice to have a small shrine to it. Calhoun is 53 now. He catches the video only every few years, when somebody will show him a tweet or video link to a clip that you will most likely see every April 14 for the rest of eternity. Calhoun is neither rich nor poor, at least in the traditional sense of the word. He does, however, feel wealthy when he talks about his four kids. The Calhoun Shot gave them all a better life. His youngest, Terrelle, is 20 and lives in Austin, Texas. Naomi, 22, is in nursing school. Gabriela, 28, is a teacher. And Clarence II, 33, is living out something beyond his own wildest dreams -- and his dad's. Don Calhoun's oldest son became a good prep basketball player at East Aurora High School and graduated in 2008. With five years of $50,000 checks left, Don encouraged Clarence to finish the job he and his brother had started years earlier: graduating from college. Clarence loved that idea. What a cool way to pay tribute to the uncle he never met but was named after. The problem was, he still didn't know what he wanted to be when he grew up. For the first few years after high school, he bounced between community colleges before getting into Wiley College, an HBCU in Marshall, Texas. He had developed an interest in the human body, especially biology. But college was no joke. Clarence Calhoun II limped to a 1.6 GPA in his first semester. It wasn't that he couldn't handle the coursework or the social life or the amount of work it took. It was the totality of doing all of those things all at once. He didn't know a single person who had experience at this level of education. He was a rookie, surrounded by rookies. That's when he met a Ukrainian physician named Dr. Valentyn Siniak. Siniak was at Wiley teaching while he took mandatory tests to begin practicing medicine in the U.S. Calhoun was blown away by the level of support Siniak provided. Calhoun isn't sure exactly what Siniak saw in him, but he saw something. In emails to Calhoun, Siniak began calling him \"Dr. Clarence Calhoun.\" When Calhoun asked him for guidance on how he could get his grades up, Siniak made him laugh out loud. \"I think you should start tutoring other students,\" Siniak said. \"Tutoring?\" Calhoun said. \"I'm struggling to learn everything myself. How can I teach others?\" Siniak thought this would give Calhoun an extra nudge to learn the material and boost his own command. EDITOR'S PICKS The college wrestlers who took on a grizzly bear 151dRyan Hockensmith Patrick Mahomes and the most important quarterback battle in football history 193dRyan Hockensmith The real MVP moment of Aaron Judge's season 318dRyan Hockensmith Siniak was exactly right. So right, in fact, that Calhoun sighs and shakes his head on a Zoom describing this section of his life. He still can't fathom the way Siniak manifested belief into Calhoun's life. His grades soared, and he liked working with other students. He had to work his ass off to get there -- at one point, campus security officers would close up the science building for the night, knowing Calhoun was still in there. He'd study most of the night, inflate a mattress for a few hours and wake up the next day ready to do it again. \"I found out I was smarter than I thought I was,\" Calhoun says now. And so in 2013, Calhoun graduated from college just as his dad's $50,000 annual checks ended. He was the first in his family to get a college degree, and he battled and scrapped every day to get it. He also had found out that his girlfriend was pregnant and that they were having a boy. When he told Don, he said, \"Know what we're going to name him, Dad?\" Don began to think about it for a second ... and then it hit him. He didn't say a word, and his son didn't either. They laughed, hugged and celebrated the upcoming birth of Clarence Calhoun III. Clarence Calhoun II started to chart a course for the next phase of his life, which had come into focus for him. \"I want to be a doctor,\" he told his dad, and he began to try to get into medical school. He worked jobs at Jiffy Lube, a toxicology lab and other places before he finally passed his labs and got accepted. This was happening. Not only was a Calhoun going to earn his degree but he felt as if he might actually become the Dr. Clarence Calhoun his instructor, Dr. Siniak, had predicted in his emails. That's why it breaks the younger Calhoun's heart to tell this next part of the story. Siniak didn't get to see Calhoun get his degree. In January 2013, Siniak was struck and killed while riding a motorcycle in Texas. \"Having him believe in me helped me believe in myself,\" Calhoun says. \"My biggest downfall that was keeping me from excelling was my confidence. I just didn't think I could. I didn't have anybody around me who had done it.\" Over the next eight years, he passed his boards and did his residency, and an envelope arrived in May 2021 that he couldn't wait to open. The piece of paper inside made it official: He was now Dr. Clarence Calhoun. He went to his dad's house to show him in person, and they had a long embrace. Don couldn't stop smiling. After a minute, he walked out of the room and came back holding two things he was giving to his son. One was the shoes he had worn during The Calhoun Shot. Clarence noticed they had a signature on them. They were autographed by ... none other than Don Calhoun, which makes Clarence laugh to this day when he holds them up. His dad can be a goofball -- an inspiring goofball. \"He drops spiritual motivation all the time, and that's always needed,\" Clarence says. \"In moments when it feels like life is too difficult, he helps you figure out how you can do it.\" For the second item, Don Calhoun didn't hand it to him. He reared back and threw a push pass at his son's chest. \"Here, I want you to have this,\" and he chucked an old basketball at his son. Clarence Calhoun II hadn't seen the ball from The Calhoun Shot in 10-15 years, and now it was going to live with him and his son. The two older Calhouns, Don and Clarence, hugged once more. And as Dr. Clarence Calhoun left that day, with a basketball under one arm and some old shoes under the other, his whole life felt like sinking a less than 1% three-quarter-court shot.

Its an ownership mentality that has rewarded Jordan extraordinarily well throughout his career.His reputation and brand were all associated directly to whatever was happening to the Bulls franchise and happening in that stadium (which includes the fan experience). Now, Jordan might not notice if something trivial happens in regards to the fan experience, but something big enough to make the nightly news (and for which he was there when it happened anyway), he&#x27;s going to take notice.If they don&#x27;t honor that, it reflects poorly on the Bulls franchise. This was a Bulls fan making a life-altering one in a thousand shot on Jordan&#x27;s court. Jordan&#x27;s on video celebrating with the guy. The fans, broadly, are going to be largely ignorant of the ins and outs of what was going on with the payout - what the fans know, is someone hit that shot and is getting screwed, and that it was a promotion that - as far as the average fan understood - was being put on by the Bulls. When it comes to brand, it doesn&#x27;t only matter what&#x27;s factually correct, Jordan understood perception. If that guy gets screwed out of his money, it might as well be the Chicago Bulls doing it (even if they put out press releases trying to disassociate in regards to responsibility).When Jordan gets to the point and asks the winner: did you get your money? What he meant is: did those rat bastard businessmen pay you, because if they didn&#x27;t, it reflects poorly on me, my team, my franchise, and I take that personally. reply xhevahir 16 hours agorootparentThis assumes too much about Jordan&#x27;s psychology. Yes, he was aware that a great deal of money was riding on his image, and he was could be very shrewd and even his cynical when it came to business, viz., his remark that \"Republicans buy sneakers, too.\" But this picture of Jordan as ruthless utility-maximizer and PR savant doesn&#x27;t square with other things he&#x27;s done, such as the raw spectacle he made of himself in his Hall of Fame induction speech.

He was an average office supply salesman but felt calm and destined to make the nearly impossible shot. The shot went viral and sparked a boom in in-game contests at sporting events. Companies like SCA Promotions started insuring these big-money contests, which remained popular crowd pleasers. Calhoun initially feared he wouldn&#x27;t get the money because he had played some college basketball recently. This violated a common rule that contestants couldn&#x27;t have played the sport recently. The Bulls held a press conference saying they would pay Calhoun the $1 million regardless of the insurance outcome. Later, Michael Jordan privately told Calhoun that the Bulls players had pressured the insurance company to pay him. Calhoun got Jordan to sign the winning ball years later after persistence.

It also contains a doubling step pre-play that pulls in some of the strategy of vulnerable&#x2F;double&#x2F;redouble from Bridge.

Human existence is unfair. Arguably, the mere fact we exist is a series of random occurrences that align to a local optimum for natural incentives evolving to our current state of existence. Randomness is an expression of the basic entropy of the universe and touches on the individual lives of not just humans, but every atom in every living and non-living entity on this planet (and beyond). This sometimes expresses it in the unfairness encounter in some person&#x27;s life. It is hardly an indictment of society. reply jncfhnb 18 hours agorootparentIf you’re willing to appeal to the intrinsic randomness of the universe at the atomic level then you’re basically arguing that every nuance is random and meaningless.And if you’re not, then you’re just cherrypicking things that suit your fancy.The universe has sufficient structure to observe its properties even if the underlying mechanisms are random. reply gnz11 19 hours agorootparentprevSince you are making book suggestions (or not), I would suggest then that you open this [1] book up.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Dawn_of_Everything reply tristor 18 hours agorootparentThanks for the recommendation, I will definitely check it out.

That struggling student is now a medical doctor and the first person in their family to graduate from college.\"This is an indictment on the American system how? It seems like the opposite to me. Is your stance that no one should ever have to struggle? You believe regardless of success in secondary education everyone should just be sent to medical school? You do realize that EVERY country that provides \"free\" higher education has pretty stringent requirements to get in. In the US, anyone that has the money, wants to take out a loan, or does well in school can go to college. All that would happen if everyone though the way you do, is that you would just dilute the pool of applicants and you&#x27;d still have people that didn&#x27;t get successful jobs.

We have effectively no licensing standards, and effectively no enforcement of basic safe driving practices. The only thing that&#x27;s generally enforced in the US is speed limits, and this is only done for revenue purposes, especially since most speed limits in the US are set artificially low to help local authorities meet their budget.It&#x27;s both possible that the US is uniquely worse and that the same sort of unfair and senseless outcomes are not only possible but happen in other countries. The fact the US is worse doesn&#x27;t actually change the point of the person you&#x27;re responding to.I could write a much better indictment of driving in the US than pointing to a single random occurrence and actually talk about the completely fucked way people drive here on a daily basis. That said, the same basic reason why things are the way they are won&#x27;t change for the outcome of my screed, as it is a simple matter that the US is so heavily car-centric as a society that it is impossible for the average person to participate in daily life without driving and therefore it&#x27;s seen as unnecessarily punitive to restrict people&#x27;s driving privileges except in the most egregious circumstances (and often not even then). We&#x27;d have to massively change the attitude towards cars in the US to effectively change anything about our current situation to make it possible to enforce reasonable standards of driving skill. reply zetta0 18 hours agorootparentprevI think US&#x27;s car fatality problem stems from the \"driving classes\" you take at 16 for one day to become a driver. You don&#x27;t really learn to deal with all possible scenarios doing 3 left turns and parking. There&#x27;s 2 other big reasons the roads are unsafe due to the states just not taking care of their own roads. The other reason is the popularity of bigger SUVs and trucks. 90% of big vehicle owners feel safer due to the weight of their vehicle as if they truly intend to total anyone else&#x27;s vehicle that they hit. When I was in Europe I noticed cars are a lot more popular than SUVs or trucks. Getting in an accident with 2 cars is a lot less destructive than a 4,000 lb car hitting a 6,000 lb truck or SUV. reply bitdivision 18 hours agorootparentprevRegarding car accidents, the US does have a higher rate of deaths per 100k inhabitants [0] than most other countries of similar development.

The education in this country has huge cultural and community disparities that almost perfectly correlate w&#x2F; wealth disparities, racial disparities, and family life disparities. Most of these things are symptoms rather than causes, but they&#x27;re symptoms that accelerate a negative feedback loop. The causes are pretty straightforward, but intractable: 1. Lack of cultural and racial integration in broader society 2. The failure of families (as a concept) in America, with this failure more heavily concentrated in lower class households with a racially disparate distribution. reply DrThunder 18 hours agorootparentprev\"Western Nations\"You do realize the US doesn&#x27;t have the public transport of massive cities in western Europe right?Maybe think a bit and you&#x27;ll realize that Americans have to drive more to get places.Regardless, the crashes have nothing to do specifically with the way America has implemented anything.\"but that that public education had failed to prepare this person and apparently a whole community for higher education\"The comment was specifically about how the US has done it badly.
