Pls help spread this finding!We found clean, CAUSAL evidence that the shingles vaccine prevents a good chunk of dementia cases. So, could a virus cause Alzheimer\u2019s->YES!Hear me out & see preprint: bit.ly/3MVqXU9\ud83e\uddf51/There\u2019s recently been \u2b06\ufe0f interest in the possibility that a virus may be involved in the causal pathways of dementia. Most attention has been on herpesviruses, incl the VZV that causes chickenpox and shingles, partly because of their lifelong latency (bit.ly/3nibvYk).2/In Wales starting in Sept 2013, the shingles vaccine was rolled out using an exact DOB cutoff. Those born on or after Sept 2 1933 were eligible, while those born earlier weren\u2019t and remained ineligible for life. We analyzed EHR data for all of Wales with DOB exact to the week.3/We first show that just a one-week difference in age causes a massive (47 %-point) difference in the probability of ever getting the vaccine.This is paradise for getting at CAUSATION rather than correlation!4/After all, there\u2019s no reason why those born one week before Sept 2 1933 should differ in anything from those born just one week later, EXCEPT for this diff in vacc receipt. This is just like a clinical trial: two exchangeable groups with only one getting the intervention.5/So, no need for the usual heroic assumption of perfect info on all confounders that make those who get the vacc different from those who don\u2019t. This is crucial, and why our study is fundamentally different to other (all correlational) analyses in this area.What did we find?6/We first tried to replicate the vaccine\u2019s known effect from clinical trials that it prevents shingles and PHN. It does \u2013 no surprise here but nice proof of concept.Now we test our real hypothesis: does getting vaccinated \u2b07\ufe0f your chance of a dementia diagnosis years later?7/It does! We estimate that over a 7-year follow-up period, getting vaccinated averts one in five new dementia diagnoses. In the paper, we demonstrate through extensive robustness checks that it is essentially impossible that this finding is due to confounding.8/Given how robust this finding is across a large variety of specifications and series of robustness checks, it\u2019s also extremely unlikely to be due to pure chance.9/We then show that the vaccine has no effect on any other common causes of morbidity or mortality. This is unlike correlational analyses that usually suffer from bias because healthier/more health motivated folk with better healthcare access are more likely to get vaccinated.10/Shingles is more common in women + \u2b06\ufe0f recognition that the causes of Alzheimer\u2019s may differ by sex (bit.ly/3HqGh8k). We find strong protective effects of the vaccine for women but none for men, and that this diff is driven by Alzheimer\u2019s (not vascular) dementia.11/What\u2019s needed next? 1) Randomized trials w/ precise cognition measures to determine exact effect size + optimal pop groups & time interval for vacc. Any interest @Merck @merckgroup @MerckFoundation @Merck_lifesci @GSK @GSKUS @GSK_bio? I have ideas for doing this ethically.12/2) Research to understand how the shingles vaccine prevents or delays dementia; and 3) trials to determine if the vaccine reduces (or maybe even reverses) cognitive decline among those with MCI or mild dementia.#neurotwitter #NeuroTwitterNetwork #Neuroscience13/Preprint: bit.ly/3MVqXU9FANTASTIC team: @meyting3, Min Xie, @simonhhessBig thanks to mentors: @steveaschmd, T B\u00e4rnighausen, S VollmerAnd funders: @czbiohub @NIAIDNews@Stanford @StanfordDeptMed @StanfordMed @stanford_pcph @StanfordEpiNews @StanfordHP @StanPopHealthWould LOVE comments from the causal inference crowd #epitwitter #econtwitter @melodem_group @MariaGlymour @goodmanmetrics @BaiocchiMike @drehkopf @ProfMattFox @guido_imbens @Susan_Athey @ER_Mayeda @PennCausal @NoahHaber @AnupamBJena @JacobBor @societyforepi @JeremySussman \u2026\u2026 dementia leaders @RudyTanzi @alzfdn @TheADDF @AlzResearchUK @CureAlzheimers @ABFbrain @FisherCenter @StanfordBrain @BrainResilience @Stanford_Neuro @NIHAging @NeuroscienceNew @DementiaAllianc @AlzDisInt @womensbrainpro @UsAgainstAlz @womensalz @_BrightFocus\u2026 sci comm leaders @hmkyale @EricTopol @Bob_Wachter @hubermanlab @davidasinclair @PeterAttiaMD @thehowie @foundmyfitness @docartemis @NakedScientists @profvrr @garwboy @sleepdiplomat @kevinmd @Rbaltman @choo_ek @NAChristakis @devisridhar @CarlosdelRio7\u2026 & colleagues @IDDocJen @nikkilsud @vcharuMD @dkowens @boussard @SalomonJA @NathanLo3579 @RanakTrivedi @JuliaRaifman @oziadias @BruceNeal1 @mbondy2 @HeartBobH @JasonAndrewsMD @Shuchi_Anand @SaraJeanSinger @jjaimemiranda @uniklinik_hd @StanfordCDH @LongevityCenter @StanfordDBDS\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Missing some Tweet in this thread?

    "hn_content": "A study suggests that the shingles vaccine decreases the risk of getting dementia. Herpes viruses, including HSV1/2, may cause Alzheimer's, with the APOE4 genome making it worse. Other herpesvirus types can also be asymptomatic. There are ongoing efforts to develop cures and vaccines for herpes viruses, including chickenpox and shingles. Research shows that the chickenpox vaccine does not eliminate the risk of Alzheimer's, but it reduces the chances of contracting the varicella-zoster virus, which causes shingles. Epstein-Barr virus may be a key factor in multiple sclerosis, but there are no effective antivirals to treat it. People diagnosed with chronic herpes infections might be at risk of chickenpox-related dementia. Few first-line therapies are available, causing chronic mono patients to suffer fatigue and malaise with no cure in sight.Graduate school and academia can be difficult to navigate for people with disabilities, especially those with chronic illnesses and limited financial resources. Despite this, some individuals with disabilities continue to pursue STEM fields, such as software engineering and medical research, in hopes of making a difference. However, high barriers to entry and limited funding for research in certain fields can make it difficult for non-traditional candidates to participate. Additionally, evidence suggests that some chronic illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome, may be linked to certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex virus, creating further complications for individuals with these conditions. Despite these challenges, some companies and researchers are exploring new approaches, such as mRNA vaccines, to address disease.The article discusses how mutations in viruses can affect the effectiveness of vaccines. The spike protein in Covid-19, for example, was highly conserved until it mutated to evade the highly-specific immunity created by mRNA vaccines, resulting in the Omicron variant. mRNA vaccines, however, can \"target specific sequences\" and avoid problematic sequences. The article also includes discussions on nucleic-acid based vaccines and protein-based vaccines, as well as the positive impact of mRNA technology on rapid vaccine development. The comment section contains discussions on the cost and funding priorities of medical research, herpes zoster, and possible links between viral infections and dementia.A study on the potential link between the shingles vaccine and the prevention of Alzheimer's disease has found that being eligible for the vaccine can have a prophylactic effect against dementia. Researchers found a significant decrease in dementia rates in the vaccinated population born one week after the eligibility cut-off date compared to those born one week before the cut-off date. The study also found the protective effects were stronger for women than men, and that the vaccine may be beneficial against Alzheimer's but not vascular dementia. The apparent link raises questions about Alzheimer's as a potential virus-related disease. However, several commenters warned that the effect could be too small to prompt preventive measures and that the study only demonstrated an indirect link.A new study suggests the shingles vaccine might have \"significant protective effects\" against Alzheimer's disease in women. The study found that women who had received the shingles vaccine were found 70% less likely to develop Alzheimer's. Researchers suggest that the vaccine might stimulate immune cells to help clear the brain of toxic beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which have been linked to Alzheimer's. However, the results in men were inconclusive, with some suggesting that there was a potential protective effect that the study could not detect due to lack of statistical power. The Shingrix vaccine should still be taken to protect against shingles, as shingles is also a potentially debilitating illness.",

Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Vox MediaAmazon scrapped its Shipment Zero initiative, which was announced a few years ago.The company has rolled the goal into its broader Climate Pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2040.Amazon deleted the original Shipment Zero blog post. We dug it up.Often, it can feel like big corporations choose their bottom line when it comes to hard choices over profit versus the environment. Amazon is giving off that vibe this week.The ecommerce giant recently backed out of a commitment to make 50% of its shipments net-zero carbon by 2030. Amazon said in a statement that it would roll this goal into a broader Climate Pledge to reach net-zero carbon across all its operations by 2040. That's a decade later than the 50% goal, which was called \"Shipment Zero\" at the time.\"As we examined our work toward The Climate Pledge, we realized that it no longer made sense to have a separate and more narrow Shipment Zero goal that applied to only one part of our business, so we've decided to eliminate it,\" Amazon wrote in the statement.The investigative reporter Will Evans squeezed this information from Amazon and tweeted about it Thursday. Last year, Evans uncovered a study that said the company had drastically undercounted its carbon footprint. At the time, an Amazon spokesman reiterated the company's commitment to cutting emissions, including ordering a fleet of electric delivery vans and buying renewable energy for its electricity needs.Dropping the specific shipment pledge is noteworthy because Amazon's ecommerce operation relies on vast fleets of vehicles and aircraft to deliver packages to consumers quickly. Most of this activity chews up vast quantities of fossil fuels and spews out greenhouse gases. However, fast delivery is a key selling point for shoppers and the main reason millions subscribe to the company's Prime program.Amazon announced the Shipment Zero initiative in a blog a few years ago. The company has since deleted the post. However, through the magic of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, large corporations cannot rewrite online history. Here's a version of the blog.Some choice phrases from the announcement, so you can see what Amazon is backing out of now:\"We can now see a path to net zero carbon delivery of shipments to customers, and we are setting an ambitious goal for ourselves to reach 50% of all Amazon shipments with net zero carbon by 2030.\"\"We believe that lower costs include lowering the costs to the environment we all live and work in every day. We'll keep you posted as we work towards achieving Shipment Zero.\"\"It won't be easy to achieve this goal, but it's worth being focused and stubborn on this vision and we're committed to seeing it through.\"Read nextE-CommerceAmazonAmazon Climate PledgeMore...",

    "hn_content": "Amazon has backed out of its Climate Pledge and removed the Shipment Zero initiative. Amazon bought the naming rights for the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, yet public transportation infrastructure around the arena is considered horrendous, leading people to avoid it entirely. The West Seattle/Ballard Link Extensions may include stops at Seattle Center, but shovels will not be in the ground until 2026, and there is no ETA for completion. The slow progress in Seattle's planning and construction has been attributed to modern civil engineering methods being incredibly inefficient, as each possible way of building the infrastructure must be considered along each segment, including studying environmental impact, leading to massive delays. The tech industry in Seattle has grown faster than infrastructure can keep up with, leading to horrendous traffic and two-hour commutes.There is no meaningful content in this text.The article discusses the topic of holding corporations accountable for their carbon emissions goals. Some argue that companies that promote goals for PR purposes should be held accountable for missing them, while others believe that the focus should be on laws that set emissions limits. The idea of carbon offsetting is criticized as greenwashing accounting shenanigans. Microsoft is mentioned as the only hyperscaler that seems to take carbon emissions seriously, aiming for carbon zero by 2030. However, some criticize the emissions caused by resource-demanding OSes and unwanted features within them. One person quit Amazon Prime due to the environmental impact caused by delivery vans. Some argue that having fewer people driving to a neighborhood through delivery could be more efficient than people driving to stores individually.- Amazon is no longer committed to its pledge to reduce delivery emissions by 50% by 2030.\n- Instead, the company is rolling the goal into a broader Climate Pledge.\n- Some customers are unhappy and have canceled their Prime subscriptions in response to the news.\n- There is debate over whether individual actions, such as canceling subscriptions, are effective in promoting change.\n- Companies are struggling to balance environmental commitments and financial profits.\n- The effectiveness of carbon offsets and biofuels as solutions to reducing emissions is disputed.",

I don\u2019t know why I was there (observation?), and it\u2019s not be point - the point is, while there, slightly older patients taught me how to fold beautiful paper airplanes, with unbelievable aerodynamic properties - I mean those things could fly.Many years later, I was taking an aerodynamics course at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University taught by Bob Sweginnis (died in plane crash, while practicing aerobatics), who dedicated an entire class to a paper airplane contest. The winning criteria was \u201cplane that stays in the air the longest wins\u201d.My plane came in second - I designed it to make an easy curve through the bungalow to maximise air time, and Bob Sweginnis did an excellent job launching it. He stopped the timer when my plane hit the wall of the bungalow, with plenty of altitude to spare.The winner?

    "hn_content": "Developers discuss the benefits of htmx, a library that substitutes a DOM element with the HTML response acquired from an on-click HTTP request instead of redirecting to a new page. htmx simplifies hypermedia development modalities, allows back-end teams to work with preferred languages, and permits developers to integrate with other JavaScript libraries, besides enabling interdependent data manipulation and allowing server-side routing. Bibliographic comparisons were made with Handlebars, jQuery, React, and Angular during development. The notion behind the platform is to attain the right balance between simplicity and offering a goody worth adding some salt to the web development recipe. Concerns have been expressed about the update actions often being too unrestricted, not allowing systematic progress analysis of the program's source code.The post discusses different approaches to programming with JavaScript, such as using HTMX and React for structuring components and interactions. While some commenters argue against using frameworks due to their complexity and constantly changing nature, others tout the benefits of having some structure and organization in the form of API endpoints, one-way data flow, and reusable components. Additionally, some discuss the challenges of developing for poor network connections and whether a native app might be better suited for certain use cases. Overall, the post provides insights into various perspectives on using JavaScript and frameworks.- JavaScript developers argue that the negative image of their code is a result of junior developers creating sloppy code and not reflective of the language's actual capabilities.\n- The ecosystem of JavaScript and web development is constantly changing, with new frameworks and libraries emerging regularly.\n- React has emerged as the dominant framework over the past six years, and it is recommended for developers looking to build their skills and remain employable.\n- Some developers are criticizing the complexity of JavaScript and the challenges of maintaining complex web apps.\n- HTMX, a dependency-free JavaScript library, is gaining traction as a solution for simplifying web development and improving productivity.HTMX, a client-side web framework, is gaining popularity due to its ease of use and ability to create dynamic web applications without extensive knowledge of JavaScript or other complex frameworks. HTMX is based on HyperTalk, the scripting language of HyperCard, while incorporating web-specific syntax. HTMX allows developers to write web apps the way they did in 1999, but with the ability to update pages partially, make forms more dynamic, and create interactive features with ease. Many developers have used HTMX to build small or medium-scale projects, such as internal tools or marketing agency websites that require simple forms and dynamic features. HTMX\u2019s strengths primarily lie in its ease of use, the simplicity of the primary documentation, and its strong focus on backend development.HTMX is a library that targets web developers who need interactivity on their website while still using plain vanilla HTML, allowing developers to use good old anchor and form tags to fall back to full-page loads if JavaScript is disabled. By submitting a form with a post request and then loading an entire page with a thank you message, the local hair salon taking reservations, mom and pop store's contact form, or a local newspaper's letter to the editor form can be done without htmx or JavaScript. HTMX removes abstractions from web projects, extending the existing abstraction of hypermedia to implement many common UI patterns without additional concepts. HTMX does have some limitations as progressive enhancement requires good knowledge of HTTP and the DOM. HTMX does require JavaScript to work, although it can fall back to full-page loads if JavaScript is disabled. Overall, HTMX provides a simple, accessible solution for some use cases but may not serve as a long-term solution for more complex use cases.Developers are discussing the benefits and purpose of htmx, a tool that aims to remove arbitrary limitations from HTML and reduce the need for JavaScript. Some commenters argue that HTML is designed to be dynamic via hypermedia controls, while others believe that the distinction between HTML, CSS, and JS is already well-defined and serves as a useful separation of concerns. Nonetheless, some believe that htmx is a valuable tool for simplifying web development, particularly for backend developers who may not have extensive JS knowledge. Some commenters also mention alternative tools and frameworks, including Unpoly, Phoenix LiveView, and Hotwire. The discussion touches on various aspects of web development, including web crawling, web design, and frontend vs. backend development.- HTMX is a client-side JS system for building interactive HTML applications without directly touching JavaScript. \n- HTML itself is barely useful as a starting point for building applications. \n- Unpoly would be easier to use for creating interactive documentation websites with static site generators like Hugo. \n- It is technically feasible to create interactive documentation with HTMX in Hugo but the tooling is not there yet. \n- There are debates about how to write idiomatic HTML and the use of other technologies such as React. \n- The aesthetic of the filler text on HTMX examples is generated by Hipster Ipsum. \n- The <details> tag can be used for a hamburger menu but it can be bad for accessibility.",

Some claim that Glassdoor is influenced by money and that companies can use its \"premier program\" to remove negative reviews. Others suggest treating Glassdoor reviews like Amazon reviews, looking for patterns rather than just looking at the overall average. Some also propose creating a worker-owned Glassdoor competitor that allows users to own their own data, with the possibility of private sharing and monetization. Overall, the discussion highlights the challenges of trust and transparency in online review platforms.An iOS/macOS app for deployment site management is being developed, but concerns arise regarding customer-base expansion, and a potential web client may be implemented in the future.

New data from JATO Dynamics has revealed that in the first quarter of 2023 the Tesla Model Y is the best-selling car in the world, selling 267,200 in the first three months of the year, eclipsing Toyota Corolla\u2019s 256,400 sales.This was predicted a few years ago by Tesla boss Elon Musk before the car was even launched and now it\u2019s happened.Here in Australia, Tesla Model Y has been a hugely popular model since its launch in June last year and is already the second best selling SUV of any type, just behind the Toyota RAV4.It has sold more than 14,000 of these electric SUVs in Australia. This year, over 5,000 have been sold with this quarter looking to be its best so far. The start of it saw April\u2019s sales coming up to 2,095 according to data from FCAI vFacts.SOURCE: VFACTSThe sales continue to rise in Australia, despite the vehicle price not qualifying for many state and territory incentives due to its higher starting price when compared to the Tesla Model 3.When comparing it to ICE vehicles, the Tesla Model Y is the best-selling Medium SUV in the over $60,000, in the country by a wide margin. With 5,264 sales, it far outpaces the next best-selling Medium SUV which is the Audi !5 with 1,618 sales.Earlier this year, data compiled by Tesla and EV News enthusiast Sawyer Merritt on Twitter shows how Model Y has fared in total sales when compared to the world\u2019s best-selling vehicles in 2022.This is a huge milestone for the EV transition. It shows legacy automakers that the time to produce and sell more compelling EVs is now if they are to survive the automotive valley of death.Riz AkhtarRiz is the founder of carloop based in Melbourne, specialising in Australian EV data, insight reports and trends.

The reduced footprint of EV drivetrains creates more interior space, which is a significant advantage. The breadth of EV offerings has pleasantly surprised buyers looking for a new car. Best-selling metrics are somewhat limited and easy to breach, and build quality is a hallmark of the Corolla, which is not necessarily a hallmark of Tesla. Integrated backup cameras provide better visibility than traditional rear windows, and car cameras can improve it further. Competitors designed EVs from the ground up, just like Tesla. Tesla's minimalist cabin design is more spacious and feels more spacious thanks to the glass roof. The Polestar 1 looks great on the outside, and the UX is something that Ford would have been proud of in 2009.

The conversation covers the difference between Tesla and Polestar 2 EV models in terms of their glass roof, range, efficiency, and power. It also compares EVs with traditional combustion engine cars, highlights the need for dedicated EV platforms, and mentions the importance of reliability, build quality, and dealer networks. Additionally, the thread includes insights into the technology and design of EVs from Toyota, Korean, and Chinese manufacturers, and their potential impact on the automotive industry. Some commenters share personal experiences and anecdotes about EV ownership, maintenance, and cost-effectiveness.Commenters on Hacker News discuss the obsession with top speed and power in cars, noting that it is largely a subjective evaluation rather than an objective one. Some also criticize the marketing tactics of traditional car manufacturers and note the superior technology and marketing of companies like Tesla. However, there are also criticisms of Tesla's build quality and service, and a discussion of the limitations of technology in the automobile industry.The article discusses a conversation on Hacker News about what qualifies as \"technology\". The conversation then transitions to a discussion about the state of electric vehicles. The main focus is on the lack of affordable options for a \"second car\" or \"economy car\". The article includes personal experiences with Tesla vehicles and mentions other affordable options available outside of the US. The conversation also touches on the limitations of current EV technology, such as range anxiety and charging availability, and the slow adoption of EVs by traditional car manufacturers. Minivans are suggested as an ideal form factor for EVs due to their room/capacity per footprint.Readers engage in a discussion regarding the practicality, reliability, and cost of EVs, specifically Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y. Many praised the efficiency of the Tesla charging network while a few users mentioned the difficulties in finding charging stations. The debate included comparisons to other automobile manufacturers such as VW and Volvo. One user highlighted how purchase price of EVs is still a barrier for some potential customers, as people tend to keep old cars much longer due to an evolving market. However, surveys on reliability are expected to expand and include new EV models, including the Volkswagen ID Buzz, with some focused on distinguishing build quality versus reliability.A Tesla Model S P85 has driven up to 1 million km with only a few motor replacements. The battery was replaced under warranty and installed a loaner battery, which was used for half a year or 150,000 km before installing a new, final battery. Apartments generally have a shortage of EV chargers, making it difficult for people living in apartments to own and operate their cars. EVs degrade more slowly if they use a lot of energy from the battery to power cooling systems. Maintenance costs of Tesla vehicles are expensive, with brake pads, shattered roofs, fogging taillights, broken control arms, drive units, worn-out seats, MCUs, and tail bumpers requiring repairs. However, maintenance savings add up significantly over its lifespan.Despite the myth that Tesla parts are more expensive than other vehicles of the same model year, most parts cost the same. Of the frequently replaced parts on traditional ICE vehicles, the Tesla typically doesn't have the same parts. EVs are more expensive than non-EVs, and their total cost of ownership might be lower in perfect, ideal scenarios. Tesla's lowering of car prices appears to be a strategy to gain market share and take advantage of other manufacturers raising prices and lengthening lead times. Ford and other manufacturers are potentially selling their EVs at a loss. Investing in EVs may be a risky move for some manufacturers, as they will have to anticipate lower sales numbers. EVs offer lower maintenance costs, but battery replacement may be costly. Despite this, Tesla batteries can last up to 300,000 miles, and LFP batteries have an estimated 750,000-mile life.\u2022 Electric vehicle (EV) batteries lose efficiency over time\n\u2022 Battery replacement cost is still high, but expected to decrease in the future\n\u2022 EVs may last longer than traditional cars since they require less preventative maintenance on belts and transmissions\n\u2022 Some people may use lower range EVs as second vehicles for around-town driving\n\u2022 There are differing opinions on the cost and ease of maintenance for car parts such as belts and transmissions",

A recent ad-caused popping up on an unrelated web page and considered being detrimental to the experience. A notable long-time Firefox user reported changing sentiments the first time in over 20 years using the browser. The article mentions previous similar controversial moves by Mozilla in 2017 and claims the current display shows an arrogance not typical of a browser provider supposedly focusing on user privacy. Some reports claim that Mozilla may find these non-traditional ways of promoting its VPN service detrimental to its reputation. Discussions on the use of conspiracy theories, future Firefox updates, Brave browser as well as Firefox's competitors Safari and Edge are also mentioned.Firefox users express frustration with the browser in a discussion on Hacker News. Users comment on their dislike for Firefox and their experiences switching to alternative browsers such as Brave, Duck, and Vivaldi. Some also criticize Firefox's recent experiment with an ad overlay, which they perceive as a fundamental misunderstanding of what Firefox was built on. Many users are disappointed with Mozilla's recent direction and management, leading to commentary on the decline of Firefox. Despite these issues, some users still prefer Firefox to its competitors due to its extensibility and customization options.Mozilla's recent experiment of promoting its paid VPN service through a user-hostile advertisement has caused backlash, with users criticizing the design and questioning whether Mozilla can still be considered a non-profit. The advertisement was part of Firefox's interface, and some users reported difficulty closing it. The incident has led to concerns about accountability and decision-making at Mozilla. Some users have started looking for alternative browsers, with suggestions ranging from Safari to Falkon to ungoogled-chromium. Some advocate for Firefox to adopt a freemium model, while others argue for a decentralization of open-source browser development. There are also questions raised about the accuracy of labeling Mozilla as non-profit. The incident emphasizes the importance of considering user experience and incentives in tech business models.Firefox faced criticism for displaying an unskippable promotional message for Mozilla's VPN service. Although Firefox claimed it was an accidental experiment, users expressed their disapproval, and Mozilla reverted the feature. The incident raises questions about user privacy and the use of obtrusive advertisements by browser developers. Some users considered switching to alternative browsers such as Vivaldi or Brave, which were seen as better alternatives to Firefox and Chrome. Others suggested creating new browsers or forking the Firefox project to return to a mostly volunteer model focused on the browser. Some people preferred the Mullvad VPN service, which powered Mozilla's VPN and did not pay for commission or special sale prices, avoiding conflicts of interest.Mozilla, the developers of the Firefox browser, faced criticism from users after injecting a sponsored ad campaign into the browser chrome, causing a pop-up ad to appear. This is not the first time Mozilla has injected ads into the browser chrome, previously doing so in 2018 with a plugin that was force-installed on users. The move has sparked concerns about user privacy and potential distrust towards Mozilla. The post also includes a sarcastic comment about the situation. No new or exciting developments or releases are mentioned in the post.",

    "content": "An expert journalist recounts his experience creating a video booth with a bullet time effect for his cousin's wedding. He used an array of twelve old DSLRs arranged in an arch, triggering them simultaneously to create the effect. He combined sequences from multiple guests to create longer bullet time footage and used DaVinci Resolve to smoothly slow down the effect. He also included a main 1080p camera and mounted everything on a quarter circle stand made from a B-stock e-drum rack. The biggest challenge was powering the cameras, and the author had to experiment with multiple USB chargers before finding a reliable solution. Despite the setbacks, the resulting video was a unique and memorable way to capture memories at the wedding.A DIY bullet time video booth was created using multiple cameras, a Raspberry Pi Pico, Bluetooth push buttons, and video lights. Cameras were controlled via USB and triggered using a simple circuit with the Canon trigger input. Push buttons were made wireless using a Bluetooth module on the Pi Pico and powered by AA batteries. Video lights were brought to ensure consistency in exposure throughout the day. The preview and idle loop were displayed on an old Dell XPS 12, while the post-processing was done manually in DaVinci Resolve. The project was implemented using Python code and gphoto2, while the interface was built using Flask and shown in Chromium.A tech-savvy individual created a DIY photo booth with a bullet time effect using 13 cameras that recorded stabilized versions of all recordings with different amounts of artificial frames and generated transitions with airborne kids, flowing hair, and flying items with DaVinci Resolve through Python automation. The project required an appropriate understanding of technology and spare time and was not suitable for a bride or groom to set up on their wedding day, given the potential technical difficulties. The bullet time effect was a fantastic alternative to the traditional photo booth, and guests enjoyed posing in front of the camera array and playing with the effect, particularly later in the evening. The video booth relies on DIY infrared remote and wifi SD card interfaces to start recording and retrieving the results.",
