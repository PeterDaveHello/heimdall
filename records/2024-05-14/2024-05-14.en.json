    "commentBody": "GPT-4o (openai.com)2496 points by Lealen 16 hours agohidepastfavorite1821 comments plaidfuji 6 hours agoThis is a very cool demo - if you dig deeper there’s a clip of them having a “blind” AI talk to another AI with live camera input to ask it to explain what it’s seeing. Then they, together, sing a song about what they’re looking at, alternating each line, and rhyming with one another. Given all of the isolated capabilities of AI, this isn’t particularly surprising, but seeing it all work together in real time is pretty incredible. But it’s not scary. It’s… marvelous, cringey, uncomfortable, awe-inspiring. What’s scary is not what AI can currently do, but what we expect from it. Can it do math yet? Can it play chess? Can it write entire apps from scratch? Can it just do my entire job for me? We’re moving toward a world where every job will be modeled, and you’ll either be an AI owner, a model architect, an agent/hardware engineer, a technician, or just.. training data. reply anon373839 5 hours agoparent> We’re moving toward a world where every job will be modeled After an OpenAI launch, I think it's important to take one's feelings about the future impact of the technology with a HUGE grain of salt. OpenAI are masters of hype. They have been generating hype for years now, yet the real-world impacts remain modest so far. Do you remember when they teased GPT-2 as \"too dangerous\" for public access? I do. Yet we now have Llama 3 in the wild, which even at the smaller 8B size is about as powerful as the [edit: 6/13/23] GPT-4 release. As someone pointed out elsewhere in the comments, a logistic curve looks exponential in the beginning, before it approaches saturation. Yet, logistic curves are more common, especially in ML. I think it's interesting that GPT-4o doesn't show much of an improvement in \"reasoning\" strength. reply jdietrich 4 hours agorootparentA Google search for practically any long-tail keywords will reveal that LLMs have already had a very significant impact. DuckDuckGo has suffered even more. Social media is absolutely lousy with AI-powered fraud of varying degrees of sophistication. It's glib to dismiss safety concerns because we haven't all turned into paperclips yet. LLMs and image gen models are having real effects now. We're already at a point where AI can generate text and images that will fool a lot of people a lot of the time. For every college-educated young person smugly pointing out that they aren't fooled by an image with six-fingered hands, there are far more people who had marginal media literacy to begin with and are now almost defenceless against a tidal wave of hyper-scaleable deception. We're already at a point where we're counselling elders to ignore late-night messages from people claiming to be a relative in need of an urgent wire transfer. What defences do we have when an LLM will be able to have a completely fluent, natural-sounding conversation in someone else's voice? I'm not confident that I'd be able to distinguish GPT-4o from a human speaker in the best of circumstances and I'm almost certain that I could be fooled if I'm hurried, distracted, sleep deprived or otherwise impaired. Regardless of any future impacts on the labour market or any hypothesised X-risks, I think we should be very worried about the immediate risks to trust and social cohesion. An awful lot of people are turning into paranoid weirdos at the moment and I don't particularly blame them, but I can see things getting seriously ugly if we can't abate that trend. reply fauigerzigerk 2 hours agorootparentI think humankind has managed massive shifts in what and who you could trust several times before. We went from living in villages where everyone knew each other to living in big cities where almost everyone is a stranger. We went from photos being relatively reliable evidence to digital photography where anyone can fake almost anything and even the line between faking and improving is blurred. We went from mass distribution of media being a massive capital expenditure that only big publishers could afford to something that is free and anonymous for everyone. We went from a tiny number of people in close proximity being able to initiate a conversation with us to being reachable for everyone who could dial a phone number or send an email message. Each of these transitions caused big problems. None of these problems have ever been completely solved. But each time we found mitigations that limit the impact of any misuse. I see the current AI wave as yet another step away from trusting superficial appearances to a world that requires more formal authentication protocols. Passports were introduced long ago but never properly transitioned into the digital world. Using some unsigned PDF allegedly representing a utility bill as proof of address seems questionable as well. And the way in which social security numbers are used for authentication in the US is nothing short of bizarre. So I think there are some very low hanging fruits in terms of authentication and digital signatures. We have all the tools to deal with the trust issues caused by generative AI. We just have to use them. reply fsloth 4 hours agorootparentprevWe’ve reached a stage, where it would be advisable to not release recent photos of yourself, nor any video with sound clips to public, unless you want an AI fake instaperson of yourself starting to reach out to member of your externally visible social network, asking for money, emergency help, etc. I guess we need to have an AI secretary to take in all phonecalls from now on (spam folder will become a lot more interesting with celebrity phone calls, your dead relative phoning you etc) reply smokel 3 hours agorootparentHopefully, we will soon enter the stage where nobody believes anything they see anymore. Then, you no longer have to be afraid of being misinterpreted, because nobody is listening anymore anyway. Great time to be alive! reply simianparrot 3 hours agorootparentLuckily there’s a “solution” to that: Just don’t use the internet for dialogue anymore. As someone that grew up with late-90’s internet culture and has seen all the pros and cons and changes over the decades, I find myself using the internet less and less for dialogue with people. And I’m spending more time in nature and saying hi to strangers in reality. I’m still worries about the impact this will have on a lot of people’s ability to reason however. “Just” Tik Tok and apps like it has already had devastating results on certain demographics. reply alismayilov 50 minutes agorootparentStatistically, more and more people spend time online and on phone. I'm not sure if we still reached the peak in terms of internet usage. reply IanCal 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't know why anyone thinks this will happen. You can obviously write anything you want (we have an entire realm of works in this area that everyone knows about, fiction) and yet huge amounts of people believe passed around stories either from bad or faked media sources or entirely unsourced. reply flakeoil 1 hour agorootparentI'm not saying either you or the parent commenter is right or wrong, but fiction in books and movies are clearly fiction and we consume it as such. You are right that some people have been making up fake stories and others (the more naive) have been quick to believe in those false stories. The difference now is that it's not just text invented and written by a human, which takes time and dedication. Now it's done in a second. On top of that it's easy to enhance the text with realistic photos, audio and video. It becomes much more convincing. And this material is created in a few seconds or minutes. It's hard to know what to believe if you get a phone call with the voice of your child or colleague, and your \"child\"/\"colleague\" replies within milliseconds in a convincing way. reply IanCal 48 minutes agorootparentI agree it's fundamentally different in application which I think will have a large impact (just like targeted advertising with optimisation vs billboards), but my point is that given people know you can just write anything and yet misinformation is abound - I don't see how knowing that you can fake any picture or video or sound leading to a situation where everyone just stops believing them. I think unfortunately it will massively lower the trust of actual real videos and images, because someone can dismiss them with little thought. reply ianai 3 hours agorootparentprevBe glib, but that is one way for society to bring privacy back-and with it shared respect. I think of it as the “oh everyone has an anus” moment. We all know everyone has one and it doesn’t need to be dragged out in polite company. reply ben_w 1 hour agorootparentI'm not sure if people work like that — many of us have, as far as I can tell for millennia and despite sometimes quite severe punishments for doing so, been massive gossips. reply baq 1 hour agorootparentprevWe're doing FSB's work for them. Or PLA Unit 61398's (or their comrades). Or Bureau 121's. Brave New World indeed. reply sethammons 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm paranoid enough that I now modulate my voice and speak differently when answering an unknown phone call just in case they are recording and building a model to call back a loved one later. If they do get a call, they will be like, \"why are you talking like that?\" reply theGeatZhopa 1 hour agorootparentBut why not just make up a secret word to use with your beloved ones in critical situations. In case of ..., one needs to know that secret. Otherwise, FAKE! Gotcha! reply octatrack 2 hours agorootparentprevBetter yet, don’t answer unknown phone calls. reply pooper 1 hour agorootparent> unknown phone calls This is my biggest gripe against the telecom industry. Calls pretending to be from someone else. For every single call, someone somewhere must know at least the next link in the chain to connect a call. Keep following the chain until you find someone who either through malice or by looking the other way allows someone to spoof someone else's number AND remove their ability to send the current link in the chain (or anyone) messages. (Ideally also send them to prison if they are in the same country.) It shouldn't be that hard, right? reply NikkiA 2 hours agorootparentprevI can only imagine \"Hello, this is Guy Incognito...\" reply lobochrome 2 hours agorootparentprevHN comments, too. Long, grammatically perfect comments that sound hollow and a bit lengthy are everywhere now. It's still early, and I don't see much in corporate communications, for instance, but it will be quite the change. reply dri_ft 2 hours agorootparent>Long, grammatically perfect comments that sound hollow and a bit lengthy It's worse than I thought. They've already managed to mimick the median HN user perfectly! reply myspy 2 hours agorootparentprevNo problem, I'm here to keep the language sophistication level low. reply theGeatZhopa 1 hour agorootparentI take care of the etiquette and try to do my best to keep it low. We need one who's doing the dirty work of not discussing. reply vmfunction 1 hour agorootparentprevMany business doesn't want to send their data to a third party such as OpenAI, so until locally run LLM becomes wildly available in businesses. reply ff10 2 hours agorootparentprevI tried to make ChatGPT generate a counterpoint for that but it turns out you're right. reply schmorptron 2 hours agorootparentprevYes. The old heuristics of if something is generated by grammar and sentence structure don't work as well anymore. The thing that fucks me up the most about it is that I now constantly have to be uncertain about whether something is human or not. Of course, you've always had to be careful about misinformation on the internet, but this raises the scalability of false, hollow, and harmful output to new levels. Especially if it's a topic I'm trying to learn about by reading random articles (or comments), there isn't much of a frame of reference to what's good info and what's hallucinated garbage. I fear that at some point the anonymity that made the internet great in the first place will be destroyed by this. reply t4ng0pwn3d 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you get off the internet you'd not even realise these tools exists though. And for the statement that all jobs will be modelled to be true, it'd have to be impacting the real world. reply knallfrosch 2 hours agorootparentCapabilities aren't the problem, cultural adoption is. Just yesterday I talked to someone who still googles solutions to their Excel table woes. Didn't they know of Copilot? Maybe they didn't know, maybe none of their colleagues used it, their company didn't pay for it, or maybe all they need is an Excel update.

Neural network systems can be intoxicating because it's so \"easy\" (relatively speaking) to go from nothing to 80% in extremely short periods of time. And so it seems completely obvious that hitting 100% is imminent. Yet it turns out that each percent afterwards starts coming exponentially more slowly, and we tend to just bump into seemingly impassable asymptotes far from where we'd like to be. ~8 years ago when self driving technology was all the rage and every major company was getting on board with ever more impressive technological demos, it seemed entirely reasonable to expect that we'd all be in a world of complete self driving imminently. I remember mocking somebody online around the time who was pursuing a class C/commercial trucking license. Yet now a decade later, there are more truckers than ever and the tech itself seems further away than ever before. And that's because most have now accepted that progress on such has basically stalled out in spite of absolutely monumental efforts at moving forward. So long as LLMs regularly hallucinate, they're not going to be useful for much other than tasks that can accept relatively high rates of failure. And many of those generally creative domains are the ones LLMs are paradoxically the weakest in - like writing. Reading a book written by an LLM would be cruel and unusual punishment given then current state of the art. One domain I do see them completely taking over is search. They work excellently as natural language search engines, and \"failure\" in such is very poorly defined.

Waymo has cars on the road right now that are totally autonomous, and just expanded its footprint. It has been longer and more difficult than we all thought, and those early tech demos were a glimmer of what was to come; then we had to grind to get there, with a lot of engineering. I think what maybe seems not obvious amidst the hype is that there is a hell of a lot of engineering left to do. The fact that you can squash the weights of a neural net down to 3 bits per param and it still works -- is evidence that we have quite a way to go with maturing this technology. Multimodality, improvements to the UX of it, the human-computer interface part of it. Those are fundamental tech things, but they are foremost engineering problems. Getting latency down. Getting efficiency up. Designing the experience, then building it out. 25 years ago, early tech demos on the internet were promising that everyone would do their shopping, entertainment, socializing, etc... online. Breathless hype. 5 years after that, the whole thing crashed, but it never went away. People just needed time to figure out how to use it and what it was useful for, and discover its limitations. 10 years after that, engineering efforts were systematized and applied against the difficult problems that still remained. And now: look at where we are. It just took time. reply achierius 4 hours agorootparentI don't think he's saying that AGI is impossible — almost noone (nowadays) would suggest that it's anything but an engineering challenge.

For example, I've been working on a system to extract certain financial \"facts\" across SEC filings. ChatGPT has not been helpful at all either with designing or implementing (except to give some broad, obvious hints about things like regular expressions), nor would it be useful if it was used for the actual automation.

I remember during the renaissance of neural networks (ca. 2010-15) it was said that \"more data leads to better models\", and that was at a time when researchers frowned upon the term Artificial Intelligence and would rather use Machine Learning. Fast forward a decade LLMs are very good synthetic data generators that try to mimic human generated input and I can't think somehow that this wasn't the sole initial intent of LLMs. And that's it for me. There's not much to hype and no intelligence at all. What happens now is that human generated input becomes more valuable and every online platform (including minor ones) will have now some form of gatekeeping in place, rather sooner than later. Besides that a lot of work still can't be done in front of a computer in isolation and probably never will, and even if so, automation is not a means to an end.

Maybe 3 times more efficient, considering the increase in performance. Combined, those point towards some major breakthroughs having gone into the model. If the quality of the output hasn't gone up THAT much, it's probably because the technological innovations mostly were leveraged (for this version) to reduce costs rather than capabilities. My guess is that we should expect them to leverage the 2x-3x boost in efficiency in a model that is at least as large as GTP4 relatively soon, probably this year unless OpenAI has safety concerns or something, and keeps it internal-only. reply golol 4 hours agorootparentprevI think 4o is actually noticeably smarter than 4, after having tried it a tiny bit on the playground. reply jimmySixDOF 54 minutes agorootparentThere has been speculation that this is the same mystery model floating around on lmsys chat bot arena and they claim a real observable jump on elo scores but this remains to be seen some people don't think its even as capable as GPT4-Turbo so tbd reply jiggawatts 4 hours agorootparentprevBranding aside, this pretty much is GPT 5.

It’s good stuff, a game changer in many ways. In no way however, does it represent generalized AI, and nobody in the field makes this claim even though the output of these algorithms match or out perform humans in cases. LLMs are no different. Like DL modules that are very good at outputting images that mimic biological signatures, LLMs are very good at outputting texts that eerily mimic human language. However — and this is a point which programmers are woefully and comically ignorant — human language and reason are two separate things. Tech bros wholly confuse the two however, and thus make outlandish claims we have achieved or are on the brink of achieving — actual AI systems. In other words, while LLMs and DL in general can perform specific tasks well, they do not represent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, and thus will have a much narrower application space than actual AI. reply DatoClement 3 hours agorootparentThis is true. But only to a point where mimicking and more broadly speaking, statistically imitating data, are understood in a more generalized way. LLMs statistically imitates texts of real world. To achieve certain threshold of accuracy, it turns out they need to imitate the underlying Turing machine/program/logic that runs in our brains to understand/react properly to texts by ourselves.

But I would like to see how this is integrated into applications by third party developers where the AI is doing a specific job. Is it still as impressive? The biggest challenge I've had with building any autonomous \"agents\" with generic LLM's is they are overly gullible and accommodating, requiring the need to revert back to legacy chatbot logic trees etc. to stay on task and perform a job. Also STT is rife with speaker interjections, leading to significant user frustrations and they just want to talk to a person. Hard to see if this is really solved yet. reply steve_adams_86 7 hours agoparentI’ve found using logic trees with LLMs isn’t necessarily a problem or a deficit. I suppose if they were truly magical and could intuit the right response every time, cool, but I’d always worry about the potential for error and hallucinations. I’ve found that you can create declarative logic trees from JSON and use that as a prompt for the LLM, which it can then use to traverse the tree accordingly. The only issue I’ve encountered is when it wants to jump to part of the tree which is invalid in the current state. For example, you want to move a user into a flow where certain input is required, but the input hasn’t been provided yet. A transition is suggested to the program by the LLM, but it’s impossible so the LLM has to be prompted that the transition is invalid and to correct itself. If it fails to transition again, a default fallback can be given but it’s not ideal at all. However, another nice aspect of having the tree declared in advance is that it shows human beings what the system is capable and how it’s intended to be used as well. This has proven to be pretty useful, as letting the LLM call functions it sees fit based on broad intentions and system capabilities leaves humans in the dark a bit. So, I like the structure and dependability. Maybe one day we can depend on LLM magic and not worry about a team understanding the ins and outs of what should or shouldn’t be possible, but we don’t seem to be there yet at all. That could be in part because my prompts were bad, though. reply tomhallett 7 hours agorootparentAny recommendations on patterns/approaches for these declarative logic trees and where you put which types of logic (logic which goes in the prompt, logic which goes in the code which parses the prompt response, how to detect errors in the response and retry the prompt, etc). On \"Show HN\" I see a lot of \"fully automated agents\" which seem interesting, but not sure if they are over-kill or not. reply spdustin 6 hours agorootparentPersonally, I've found that a nested class structure with instructions in annotated field descriptions and/or docstrings can work wonders. Especially if you handle your own serialization to JSON Schema (either by rolling your own or using hooks provided by libraries like Pydantic), so you can control what attributes get included and when. reply steve_adams_86 5 hours agorootparentThe JSON serialization strategy worked really well for me in a similar context. It was kind of a shot in the dark but GPT is pretty awesome at using structured data as a prompt. reply steve_adams_86 6 hours agorootparentprevI actually only used an XState state machine with JSON configuration and used that data as part of the prompt. It worked surprisingly well. Since it has an okay grasp on how finite state machines and XState work, it seems to do a good job of navigating the tree properly and reliably. It essentially does so by outputting information it thinks the state machine should use as a transition in a JSON object which gets parsed and passed to a transition function. This would fail occasionally so there was a recursive “what’s wrong with this JSON?” prompt to get it to fix its own malformed JSON, haha. That was meant to be a temporary hack but it worked well, so it stayed. There were a few similar tools for trying to correct errors. That might be one of the strangest developments in programming for me… Deploying non-deterministic logic to fix itself in production. It feels wrong, but it works remarkably well. You just need sane fallbacks and recovery tactics. It was a proprietary project so I can’t share the source, but I think reading up on XState JSON configuration might explain most of it. You can describe most of your machine in a serializable format. You can actually store a lot of useful data in state names, context, meta, and effect/action names to aid with the prompting and weaving state flows together in a language-friendly way. I also liked that the prompt would be updated by information that went along with the source code, so a deployment would reliably carry the correct information. The LLM essentially hid a decision tree from the user and smoothed over the experience of navigating it through adaptive and hopefully intuitive language. I’d personally prefer to provide more deterministic flows that users can engage with on their own, but one really handy feature of this was the ability to jump out of child states into parent states without needing to say, list links to these options in the UI. The LLM was good at knowing when to jump from leaves of the tree back up to relevant branches. That’s not always an easy UI problem to solve without an AI to handle it for you. edit: Something I forgot to add is that the client wanted to be able to modify these trees themselves, so the whole machine configuration was generated by a graph in a database that could be edited. That part was powered by Strapi. There was structured data in there and you could define a state, list which transitions it can make, which actions should be triggered and when, etc. The client did the editing directly in Strapi with no special UI on top. Their objective is surveying people in a more engaging and personable way. They really wanted surveys which adapt to users rather than piping people through static flows or exposing them to redundant or irrelevant questions. Initially this was done with XState and no LLM (it required some non-ideal UI and configuration under the hood to make those jumps to parent states I mentioned, but it worked), and I can't say how effective it is but they really like it. The AI hype was very very strong on that team. reply necmttn 5 hours agorootparentI'm building a whole AI agent-building platform on top of Xstate actors.

To buy itself time to think, it repeats/paraphrases the question/request before actually answering. I'm sure you'll find this part is a lot quicker to process, giving the instant response (the old gpt4-turbo is generally very quick with simple requests like this). Rather impressively all it would need is an additional custom instruction. Very clever and eerily human. reply og_kalu 7 hours agoparentprev>Also STT is rife with speaker interjections, leading to significant user frustrations and they just want to talk to a person. Hard to see if this is really solved yet. This is not using TTS or STT. Audio and Image data can be tokenized as readily as text. This is simply a LLM that happens to have been trained to receive and spit out audio and image tokens as well as text tokens. Interjections are a lot more palatable in this paradigm as most of the demos show. reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentAdding audio data as a token, in and of itself, would dramatically increase training size, cost, and time for very little benefit. Neural networks also generally tend to function less effectively with highly correlated inputs, which I can only assume is still an issue for LLMs. And adding combined audio training would introduce rather large scale correlations in the inputs. I would wager like 100:1 that this is just introducing some TTS/STT layers. The video processing layer is probably also doing something similarly, by taking an extremely limited number of 'screenshots', carrying out typical image captioning using another layer, and then feeding that as an input. So the demo, to me, seems most likely to just be 3 separate 'plugins' operating in unison - text to speech, speech to text, and image to text. The interjections are likely just the software being programmed to aggressively begin output following any lull after an input pattern. Note in basically all the videos, the speakers have to repeatedly cut off the LLM as it starts speaking in conversationally inappropriate locations. In the main video which is just an extremely superficial interaction, the speaker made sure to be constantly speaking when interacting, only pausing once to take a breath that I noticed. He also struggled with the timing of his own responses as the LLM still seems to be attached to its typical, and frequently inappropriate, rambling verbosity (though perhaps I'm not one to critique that). reply og_kalu 5 hours agorootparent>I would wager like 100:1 that this is just introducing some TTS/STT layers. Literally the first paragraph of the linked blog. \"GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, and image and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.\" Then \"Prior to GPT-4o, you could use Voice Mode to talk to ChatGPT with latencies of 2.8 seconds (GPT-3.5) and 5.4 seconds (GPT-4) on average. To achieve this, Voice Mode is a pipeline of three separate models: one simple model transcribes audio to text, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 takes in text and outputs text, and a third simple model converts that text back to audio. This process means that the main source of intelligence, GPT-4, loses a lot of information—it can’t directly observe tone, multiple speakers, or background noises, and it can’t output laughter, singing, or express emotion. With GPT-4o, we trained a single new model end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network.\" reply ComputerGuru 5 hours agorootparentI can’t square this with the speed. A couple of layers doing STT are technically still part of the neural network, no? Because the increase in token base to cover multimodal tokenization would make even text inference slower, not twice as fast, as 4-turbo. But I’m not an expert! reply og_kalu 4 hours agorootparentOpen ai give so little information on the details of their models now that one can only speculate how they've managed to cut down inference costs. STT throws away a lot of information that is clearly being preserved in a lot of these demos so that's definitely not happening here in that sense. That said, the tokens would be merged to a shared embedding space. Hard to say how they are approaching it exactly. reply somenameforme 4 hours agorootparentI'd mentally change the acronym to Speech to Tokens. Parsing emotion and other non-explicit indicators in speech has been an ongoing part of research for years now. Meta-data of speaker identity, inflection, etc could easily be added and current LLMs already work with it just fine. For instance asking Claude, with 0 context, to parse the meaning of \"*laughter* Yeah, I'm sure that's right.\" instantly yields: ---- The phrase \"*laughter* Yeah, I'm sure that's right\" appears to be expressing sarcasm or skepticism about whatever was previously said or suggested. Here's a breakdown of its likely meaning: \"*laughter*\" - This typically indicates the speaker is laughing, which can signal amusement, but in this context suggests they find whatever was said humorous in an ironic or disbelieving way. \"Yeah,\" - This interjection sets up the sarcastic tone. It can mean \"yes\" literally, but here seems to be used facetiously. \"I'm sure that's right.\" - This statement directly contradicts and casts doubt on whatever was previously stated. The sarcastic laughter coupled with \"I'm sure that's right\" implies the speaker believes the opposite of what was said is actually true. So in summary, by laughing and then sarcastically saying \"Yeah, I'm sure that's right,\" the speaker is expressing skepticism, disbelief or finding humor in whatever claim or suggestion was previously made. It's a sarcastic way of implying \"I highly doubt that's accurate or true.\" ---- reply og_kalu 3 hours agorootparentIt could be added. Still wouldn't sound as good as what we have here.

I know this won't happen, of course, I am moreso hoping for laws to be updated to avoid similar kerfuffles in the future, as well as massive fines to act as a deterrent, but I don't dare to hope too much. reply __MatrixMan__ 3 hours agorootparentI was envisioning a future where we've done away with the notion of data ownership. In such a world the idea that we would: > have all of OpenAI's data for free Doesn't really fit. Perhaps OpenAI might successfully prevent us from accessing it, but it wouldn't be \"theirs\" and we couldn't \"have\" it. I'm not sure what kind of conversations we will be having instead, but I expect they'll be more productive than worrying about ownership of something you can't touch. reply smallnix 2 hours agorootparentSo in that world you envision someone could hack into openai, then publish the weights and code. The hacker could be prosecuted for breaking into their system, but everyone else could now use the weights and code legally. Is that understanding correct? reply seanmcdirmid 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is alleged, and it is very likely that claimants like New York Times accidentally prompt injected their own material to show the violation (not understanding how LLMs really work), and clouded in the hope of a big pay day rather than actual justice/fairness etc... Anyways, the laws are mature enough for everyone to work this out in court. Maybe it comes out that they have a legitimate concern, but the way they presented their evidence so far in public has seriously been lacking. reply wslack 6 hours agorootparentprevThen lawmakers should change the law, instead of a private actor asserting that their need overrides others' rights. reply CamperBob2 6 hours agorootparent\"Congressman, I have Mr. Altman on line 2.\" reply jameshart 5 hours agorootparentOr rather, I have an unending stream of callers with similar-sounding voices who all want to make chirpy persuasive arguments in favor of Mr Altman's interests. reply nwienert 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is an anti-human ideology as bad as the worst of communism. Humanity only survives as much as it preserves human dignity, let's say. We've designed society to give rewards to people who produce things of value. These companies take that value and giving nothing back to the creators. Supporting this will lead to disaster for all but the few, and ultimately for the few themselves. Paying for your (copyrighted) inputs is harmony. reply apantel 4 hours agorootparentThese models literally need ALL data. The amount of work it would take just to account for all the copyrights, let alone negotiate and compensate the creators, would be infeasible. I think it’s likely that the justice system will deem model training as fair use, provided that the models are not designed to exactly reproduce the training data as output. I think you hit on an important point though: these models are a giant transfer of wealth from creators to consumers / users. Now anyone can acquire artist-grade art for any purpose, basically for free — that’s a huge boon for the consumer / user. People all around the world are going to be enriched by these models. Anyone in the world will be able to have access to a tutor in their language who can teach them anything. Again, that is only possible because the models eat ALL the data. Another important point: original artwork has been made almost completely obsolete by this technology. The deed is done, because even if you push it out 70 years, eventually all of the artwork that these models have been trained on will be public domain. So, 70 years from now (or whatever it is) the cat will be out of the bag AND free of copyright obligations, so 2-3 generations from now it will be impossible to make a living selling artwork. It’s done. When something becomes obsolete, it’s a dead man walking. It will not survive, even if it may take a while for people to catch up. Like when the vacuum tube computer was invented, that was it for relay computers. Done. And when the transistor was invented, that was it for vacuum tube computers. It’s just a matter of time before all of today’s data is public domain and the models just do what they do. …but people still build relay computers for fun: https://youtu.be/JZyFSrNyhy8?si=8MRNznoNqmAChAqr So people will still produce artwork. reply autoexec 3 hours agorootparent> So people will still produce artwork. There's zero doubt that people will still create art. Almost no one will be paid to do it though (relative to our current situation where there are already far more unpaid artists than paid ones). We'll lose an immeasurable amount of amazing new art that \"would have been\" as a result, and in its place we'll get increasingly bland/derivative AI generated content. Much of the art humans will create entirely for free in whatever spare time they can manage after their regular \"for pay\" work will be training data for future AI, but it will be extremely hard for humans to find as it will be drowned out by the endless stream of AI generated art that will also be the bulk of what AI finds and learns from. reply CamperBob2 6 hours agorootparentprevWith you 100% on that, except that after you defeat the copyright cartel, you'll have to face the final boss: OpenAI itself.

Is that because you're not used to it? Honestly asking. This is probably the first time it feels natural where as all our previous experiences make \"chat bots\" and \"automated phone systems\", \"automated assistants\" absolutely terrible. Naturally, we dislike it because \"it's not human\". But this is true of pretty much any thing that approaches \"uncanny valley\". But, if the \"it's not human\" solves your answer 100% better/faster than the human counter part, we tend to accept it a lot faster. This is the first real contender. Siri was the \"glimpse\" and ChatGPT is probably the reality. [EDIT] https://vimeo.com/945587328 the Khan academy demo is nuts. The inflections are so good.

There are different kinds of humans. Some of them are your friends, and they're willing to take risks for you and they take your side even when it costs them something.

The problem is you don't like the customer service/sales voice because they \"pretend to be your friends\". Let me know if I didn't capture it. I don't think people \"pretend to be my friend\" when they answer the phone to help me sort out of airline ticket problem. I do believe they're trained to and work to take on a \"friendly\" tone. Even if the motive isn't genuine, because it's trained, it's way a nicer of an experience than someone who's angry or even simply monotone. Trying to fix my $1200 plane ticket is stressful enough.

When one gets to be a certain age one begins to become attuned to this tendency of others' emotions to manipulate you, so you take steps to not let that happen. You're not ignoring their emotions, but you can address the underlying issue more effectively if you're not emotionally charged.

Perhaps AI will accelerate that particular skill development, which would be a net benefit to society. reply mrbungie 6 hours agorootparentWith AI you can do A/B testing (or multi-arm bandits, the technique doesn't matter) to get into someone's mind. Most manipulators end up getting bored of trying again and again with the same person. That won't happen if you are a dealing with a machine, as it can change names, techniques, contexts, tones, etc. until you give it what its operator wants. Maybe you're part of the X% who will never give in to a machine. But keep in mind that most people have no critical thinking skills nor mental fortitude. reply achierius 4 hours agorootparentProblem is, people aren't machines either: someone who's getting bombarded with phishing requests will begin to lose it, and will be more likely to just turn off their Wi-Fi than allow an AI to run a hundred iterations of a many-armed-bandit approach on them. reply jimkleiber 7 hours agorootparentprevI think we often get better at detecting the underlying emotion with which the person is communicating, seeing beyond the one they are trying to communicate in an attempt to manipulate us. For example, they say that $100 is their final price but we can sense in the wavering of their voice that they might feel really worried that they will lose the deal. I don't think this will help us pick up on those cues because there are no underlying real emotions happening, maybe even feeding us many false impressions and making us worse at gauging underlying emotions. reply komali2 8 hours agorootparentprev> When one gets to be a certain age one begins to become attuned to this tendency of others' emotions to manipulate you This is incredibly optimistic, which I love, but my own experience with my utterly deranged elder family, made insane by TV, contradicts this.

I believe that Signal can have a lock on the client, and the database is encrypted. The other part that Du Rove conveniently left out: Signal went against the US courts and won [0]. When subpoenaed to give all user information they gave them all that had: the unix timestamp of when the account was created, and the last date you connected to the signal service.

The bigger problem with Telegram is that it by default has insecure encryption settings (as opposed to Signal, where encrypted is the default, you need to manually activate it with Telegram + I think it's not possible to enable for all chats and clients) and to my knowledge, Telegram will outright co-operate with law enforcement agencies to just hand over unencrypted communications.

He is still pissed off at the country at large (not just the government) and refused to add the Russian translation for years, for example, despite it having absolutely nothing to do with Putin. Since he is Russian in origin, it's okay to throw baseless accusations at him and spout nonsense like \"maybe they're FSB agents\" or \"maybe they hired an FSB agent without knowing it\". You see it here everywhere, and HN is one of the better sites in that regard. Well, maybe Signal has hired an NSA agent and doesn't know about it either?

If it's the same original developers, they could be squeezed through their family. reply pdimitar 21 hours agorootparentSame goes for Signal devs, or any devs really. You're only stating the obvious: humans can be forced and coerced given enough motivation and resources. Singling out Telegram, or Signal, or any other service's devs is not advancing any argument forward. reply StackRanker3000 20 hours agorootparentThere is more reason to be concerned about Telegram than most other similar services. Partly because it’s insecure by default, which makes a large percentage of conversations vulnerable. And also because the team behind it is very susceptible to pressure from the Russian government, which is especially bad when it comes to these things. Even if some of them are based out of Dubai now, it doesn’t mean that they aren’t still at risk of coercion, either directly or through for example threats against family members who remain in the country.

Signal rejects F-Droid for a different reason, though: They only want to distribute through channels where they get download statistics and control update rollouts. reply rigid 21 hours agorootparentHm f-droid provides privacy friendly https://fdroid.gitlab.io/metrics/ for some time now. I'm not sure what sort of \"control\" they have over the Play Store compared to f-droid, but I'd rather have a trusted 3rd party do the building transparently and verifyable. reply noirscape 21 hours agorootparentF-Droid uses a package maintainer-esque process where the maintainers of F-Droid can intervene and prevent an update to an app from reaching users if it's deemed to be malicious or to add anti-features. It's of particularly high need on mobile since popular apps, even those who were originally FOSS, are sold to scummy publishers who fill it with ads and subscription schemes (oft called anti-features, since removing them could be seen as a feature in and of itself), ruining the original. You can't really trust mobile app devs because the track record is downright awful. Recently that happened with the \"Simple\" collection of apps, where the Play Store version got filled with junk but the F-Droid maintainer froze the version and marked the apps as outdated since nobody could conceivably want the new versions. Of course, that strokes poorly with developers who a. don't want to deal with potential third parties in their distribution chain rejecting their updates or b. are planning to add anti-features to their apps later down the line. With signal, I'm gonna guess it's mainly a; the Play Stores checks and balances are much less invasive than the sort of thing an F-Droid maintainer might check for. (As I understand it, Google Plays checks mostly are anti-exploit and keyword scans.) reply rigid 21 hours agorootparent> where the maintainers of F-Droid can intervene and prevent an update to an app from reaching users if it's deemed to be malicious That sounds like a feature you want when using FOSS. Imagine distros wouldn't have been able to intervene quickly and malicious xz would be still deployed through their channels just because the authors want to. reply noirscape 21 hours agorootparentOh yeah, it's an absolutely wonderful feature. F-Droid is pretty much the main app store I'd recommend to get \"the basics\" from if you're ever in the unfortunate position of having to manage the mobile devices of family members. Having a maintainer \"on the lookout\" gives so much peace of mind. Not suddenly having the gallery app turn into a data collection machine and baiting less tech-savvy people into vaguely defined subscriptions is a value that's too good not to pass up on. FOSS isn't really the important part for me there; it's nice, but the real value is that F-Droid is pretty much the only app store that has some reckoning on how the relationship between mobile devs and mobile customers should be far more adversarial than on any other platform due to the poor track record of mobile devs and empowers users to be able to deal with that in a way that restores some degrees of trust. It's a fucking shame there's not an equivalent on iOS where you can just say \"yeah, what you find here can be trusted\" and then not have that gets polluted a year down the line. Apple used to somewhat police the App Store back in the early 2010s for similar peace of mind, but that's not the case anymore. reply kuschku 20 hours agorootparentprev> With signal, I'm gonna guess it's mainly a; the Play Stores checks and balances are much less invasive than the sort of thing an F-Droid maintainer might check for.

Telegram's traces back 10 years, the first version was very bad, and both versions have had a lot of scrutiny for weird design decisions. Crypto schemes which get broken usually follow a pattern of \"something smells wrong\", \"we have weakened it a little bit\", \"we have weakened it a little bit more\", \"this is now completely broken\", \"my god why are you still using MD5, it's 2017\". We're in the \"something smells wrong\" or \"we have weakened it a little bit\" phase for MTProto2, depending on how you view it. reply palata 19 hours agorootparent> But the history of the Signal protocol and implementation traces back 20 years Are you sure about that?

It does come from OTR which is 20 years old. Thanks for the clarification! reply reportgunner 18 hours agorootparentprev> It's good enough that Facebook, WhatsApp, and Skype use it for E2EE messages. Wait if it's the same why don't we just use Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype instead of Signal? reply palata 18 hours agorootparentDon't forget that Signal is the name of the app, and \"Signal Protocol\" is the name of the E2EE protocol. The parent was talking about the Signal Protocol. The fact that Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. use the Signal Protocol kind of shows that it is an accepted standard. But of course there are many reasons to use Signal (the App) instead of those apps, for instance: - The Signal App is open source. You can check the protocol implementation before you use it. For Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype, you have to trust them (or some audits). - E2EE is only one part: it ensures that nobody except the recipient can read the content of your messages. But there is a whole story around the metadata. The metadata say who writes to whom, and when. It essentially helps build a social graph. Facebook is very interested in this social graph. It would appear that the Signal Foundation is not. And even if it is not perfect, Signal does a lot to try to minimize the amount of metadata it has access to (and quite obviously Facebook has a huge incentive not to do that). This said, IMHO it is still a lot better to use WhatsApp than to use Telegram, because at least you benefit from a good E2EE. reply lynndotpy 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's only the protocol for their E2EE chats. There are two big caveats: - Facebook and Skype E2EE messages are optional, and people rarely use that option, and - Those apps collect a huge amount of data outside the contents of the messages. reply reportgunner 18 hours agorootparentStill I think mentioning the greatest data collection projects in human history in the same sentence as Signal which is supposed to fight that is not very good. reply lynndotpy 18 hours agorootparentOnly that the protocol is an accepted standard.

Crypto is notoriously easy to get wrong, even if you know a lot about it - and most people do not. Secondly, proving something secure is pretty hard as well.

The sorts of people who ship bad crypto because they don't bother to learn anything about the field are going to ignore this advice.

It is hard because there is no telltale sign you did it wrong. All crypto algorithms, even weak ones output what looks like random numbers that can be deciphered back into the original plaintext. Just by looking at it, there is no way to differentiate between secure and insecure crypto. Contrast to a physics engine, it is hard to get right, but at least, if you did it wrong, it tends to be obvious. Also, like everything security-related, it is adverserial. You may have some of the smartest and most resourceful guys on the planet working to break your thing. It is worse than even critical systems. Aircraft engine control is critical, people may die if it goes wrong, so robustness and correctness are crucial, but at least, pilots won't go out of their way to break it. reply danpalmer 21 hours agorootparentprevIt's inherently risky – cryptography is hard and building secure software is hard, so starting it from scratch rather than re-using well-vetted code increases the risk unnecessarily. It's not inherently broken, but it's sufficiently risky that it may be fair to assume it is broken. History has proven that software that's not known to be secure is typically insecure when it gets to the really hard crypto implementation. I think it's fair therefore to approximate it as \"inherently insecure\". reply kaba0 20 hours agorootparentIt’s insecure if done by your average full stack developer, that barely passed high school math.

It’s waaay different when done by math experts specialized in this topic, as is the case with telegram. reply MatejKafka 10 hours agorootparentMath experts are not necessarily good cryptographers, and authors of MTProto were not renowned cryptographers (unlike with Signal). Most people in the cryptographic community agree that the Signal protocol is well-designed, is widely believed to be secure, and the authors react openly and swiftly to potential issues. Meanwhile, a lot of the MTProto crypto is just weird (that is, it does not follow standard practices of the field, without strong reasons to do so), and many cryptographers treat it with suspicion. reply ale42 22 hours agorootparentprevBecause doing proper crypto is VERY hard. You might think you've gotten the ultimate security and one year later someone will defeat it (or cryptanalize within a practical limit, which boils down to the same), because you forgot a detail. Even just implementing a crypto algorithm properly in a way that doesn't leak information is very complex, reason for which most applications tend to use well-established crypto libraries. reply supriyo-biswas 20 hours agorootparentprevIn the case of Telegram, MTProto’s implementation leaves a lot to be desired[1][2]. Additionally, home rolled crypto does not usually get the kind of security review from the cryptography community which makes it very likely that bugs of all kinds exist.

When comparing user experience between the three, it’s easy to see why. reply altairprime 18 hours agoparentAllowing third party clients that provide identity verification signatures would be totally excellent, and I would support that. Signal does this today by verifying phone numbers themselves, so they’d have to continue doing so centrally; “never trust the client” applies to their own client just as much as anyone else’s, and “allow unverified users to initiate contact with strangers” is the spam vector infecting all modern telephony (thus STIR/SHAKEN). So with that need resolved, the biggest risk of third party clients would be intentionally compromised code within an attractive wrapper — but the only way to defend against that is to not allow third party clients at all.

What's going on with these platforms? reply epicide 19 hours agorootparentIt feels like any platform that allows for one-way initiation of a conversation is bound to increase in spam as the platform grows in usage (phone calls, email, SMS, various social media, various messengers, etc.). Do any platforms require that both parties add one another? (And/or allow for restricting an account to such a mode) e.g. if user123 and user789 wish to communicate, then user123 must add/contact user789 AND user789 must add/contact user123. Until both do so, then nothing happens. It's more work to legitimately establish contact with someone, but that seems like it pales in comparison to the effort produced by spam/scams. Same thing with verifying identities. In order to actually establish proper contact with someone, you need to communicate with them via some outside means (ideally in person) in order to establish the connection. Requiring both parties to enter/scan some ID/code/whatever seems like it would only facilitate proper verification (though not guarantee it, of course). I'm sure that I'm missing something, though. I assume I'm just not familiar enough with these platforms and that some/all of them provide such a feature. It's just odd to me that spam sounds like such a problem when it feels like the above solution would be highly effective and simple to include. reply hmmm-i-wonder 21 hours agorootparentprevPersonally I've never received a scam or spam message on Signal. reply cuu508 19 hours agorootparentI am in a Signal group which has an invite link discoverable on public internet (it's a local OpenStreetMap group).

Even here on HN. I find this suspicious. The Signal protocol has been heavily audited by many different people from many different countries. It's usually found to be sound. The telegram protocol has been found to have issues that are, if not malicious, amateur level mistakes. Once again, this is not my opinion. This is the result of independent auditors who have no affiliation with either the USA or Russia. There are positives to the UI of Telegram, there are negatives to the UI of Signal. None of these has much to do with the underlying protocol of either. Personally I'd rather we all put our collective efforts into something like the protocol suggested by Matrix, but if only given the choice of Telegram or Signal, I'd avoid Telegram like the plague.

Weird HN delays aside. I don't care if the people who can decrypt Telegram chats are allied with any one side or another. I believe the idea of \"Class enemy\" to be abhorrent, and the moral / social threats of \"the overall impact\" to be negligible when compared to the fact that using compromised communications platforms will inevitably lead to greater problems than the act of calling them out. This is the equivalent of \"You'll keep quiet if you know what's good for you\". If Telegram is broken, certain people need to stop using it. The socio-political climate of the areas most likely to be using Telegram just makes this more urgent.

Saying that I have a lot of Ukrainian friends would be an understatement and the are the only reason I have telegram-all of them favor it, which, all things considered, is a grave mistake. In practice, telegram is far more closely related to tiktok and twitter than a messaging app and by extension it is heavily used to spread misinformation: telegram channels are ultimately under the complete control of their admins and they have the ultimate authority with no way of doing anything about it. Twitter was forced to put some effort into it through community notes but that hasn't even made a dent: it literally takes two google searches to find tens of thousands of bot accounts spreading misinformation. In that regard, telegram is much worse since it's an infinite source of cognitive dissonance: People are willfully joining echo chambers, which are openly advertised as such. I am really glad that telegram is nowhere nearly as big in western countries compared to eastern Europe. It pains me to say this but, but even till this day, us eastern Europeans are way more susceptible to propaganda than the western world, although, for a million and one reasons that seems to have a huge effect on the western world as well. In that sense, telegram is an active contributor. 10/10 times I'll sit firmly behind Signal, despite the many shortcomings: there is no developer integration, if you want to create a signal account for your own personal bots or whatever, you can but only through a hacky repo that's on github. Yes, the people behind telegram know all this very well and they don't like the fact that people who are aware of it as well are favoring signal infinitely more than telegram. reply 5e92cb50239222b 19 hours agoparentAnd that's good, that's their strength.

Let's enumerate the purported problems: - \"Elon Musk said so\", which does not matter. - Signal attachments can be viewed by an attacker with local access to the client. This is not Signal's job to protect against. - Signal offers an optional `--no-sandbox` flag which only has security options if enabled on Linux. - Weaknesses in sealed sender. This is the only one that might be an actual problem (two theoretical and one empirical attack, but the latter comes from an 18 page paper that I have not read). But this does not compromise the integrity of the chats, and is not something Telegram improves on. Given how the posted described the optional `--no-sandbox` flag as \"no sandbox on Linux\", it's clear that they don't understand anything they're sharing, and they just want to spread FUD. --- edit: Per discussion below, I was wrong about the `--no-sandbox` flag. It's enabled by default. The risk is that an attacker could figure out how to use Signal to run arbitrary JavaScript. I take back my insult- it was I who did not understand the linked issue. I still stand by Signal > Telegram.

It seems I am eating my words on that item, the `--no-sandbox` flag does seem to be on in most Linux installs. From context and search, it looks necessary for it to work on Debian.

The magic of \"you could turn on encryption\" is that nearly all people using it won't. \"Ah, but if you need encryption then you'll...\" - well, two things now. Suddenly you're the person who has encryption switched on. And also more likely, someone they talk to will forget to switch it on and just blab everything into cleartext anyway. The entire importance of Signal's model is that it is always encrypted. It's why LetsEncrypt is also important: to have effective security you need to be able to hide in the crowd. If encryption usage is rare, then who's using it itself (or suddenly starts using it) becomes an extremely valuable datapoint. (so I'd add: Telegram absolutely sell timeline details of which user accounts change their frequency of encrypted chat usage). reply piaste 22 hours agorootparentAddressing only one point, not your main one which I agree with: > And also more likely, someone they talk to will forget to switch it on and just blab everything into cleartext anyway.

This means if your not careful in which chat with a single person a message is sent to it's easy to accidentally send unencrypted data.

This map shows you what’s changed in vivid detail By Daniel Wood, Connie Hanzhang Jin, Brent Jones and Jeff Brady Recently, the USDA updated its plant hardiness map for the first time in 11 years. If you’re a gardener — and everybody can be a gardener, even on a balcony or a stoop — this is a big deal! The updated map opens up new possibilities for home gardeners, but there are limits. Let’s explore how the map has changed and what this means for your garden. scroll Enter your city and state: No data found. or Surprise me! Take as an example. In 2012, the USDA classified , as Zone . Back then, coldest winter temperature was somewhere degrees Fahrenheit on average. In 2023, is still rated as Zone . In 2023, the USDA reclassified as Zone 8a. Now, the lowest winter temperature is degrees Fahrenheit on average. Even though your area’s zone didn’t change, that doesn’t mean the area hasn’t experienced some change in winter lows. The new 30-year minimum temperature average was 3.3 degrees F warmer than the previous average, which spanned 1976 to 2005. That’s because the new average minimum temperature in is 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the previous average, from an earlier period. Change in lowest winter temperature -8 -6 -4 -2 0 +2 +4 +6 +8° F About this data Most of the changes across the country are due to the warming climate. Winters are warming at a faster pace than other seasons, according to Deke Arndt, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information. At the same time, an increase in the amount and quality of data collected at weather stations across the country helped to improve the overall accuracy of temperature readings in recent years. What does your hardiness zone tell you? Some people might think their hardiness zone tells them which plants they can grow. In reality, it’s a little more complicated. Your zone measurement is an average of the coldest yearly temperature in your area over the past 30 years. Here are the coldest temperatures from each winter between 1991 and 2020 in . Though these temperature estimates differ slightly from the data the USDA used to create the zone map, we’re using them to illustrate how zones are calculated. The average coldest night over the past 30 years was about . With this average temperature, might be classified as Zone . However, the temperatures we’re showing here are based on estimates, and in this case they do not align with the more accurate, granular data that the USDA used. The USDA map classifies this area as . With this average coldest temperature, is classified as Zone . This measurement, which predicts an area’s coldest temperatures, is only useful for plants that have to survive the winter. They’re called perennials: You plant them once and they come back after each winter if they’re given the right environment to survive. Think things like trees, shrubs and woody plants. Windmill palm zones 7-11 Hydrangea zones 3-9 Azalea zones 6-9 Lavender zones 5-9 Windmill palm zones 7-11 Hydrangea zones 3-9 Azalea zones 6-9 Lavender zones 5-9 Windmill palm zones 7-11 Hydrangea zones 3-9 Azalea zones 6-9 Lavender zones 5-9 And for predicting winter plant survival, knowing an area’s hardiness zone is a big help to gardeners, says Todd Rounsaville, a horticulturist with the USDA who was involved with creating the new map. He explains that the hardiness zone “is really one of the best predictors of winter survival and plant survival in general in the landscape.” He advises gardeners to use the map as one very important tool of many in their risk assessment toolbox. “Because the USDA map has really become the industry standard for rating things, it’s pretty rare that you will not see a zone rating on a plant, either on the tag or on a website,” he says. Knowing what your average coldest temperature is helps rightsize your expectations about what might grow in your area. Live in Chicago’s Zone 6a? You can be assured that no citrus plants will survive your winter. Instead, try an apple tree. The apple tree is that kid you grew up with who wore shorts all winter. It needs the cold temperatures to set fruit. Live in Miami’s Zone 11a? No apples for you. Instead, grow dragon fruit! What does your hardiness zone not tell you? On its own, your hardiness zone can’t tell you exactly what to grow in your area. For example, parts of these three areas — Juneau, Alaska; Boston, Mass.; and Santa Fe, N.M. — are all in USDA’s Zone 7a. Juneau, Alaska Boston, Mass. Santa Fe, N.M. Juneau, Alaska Boston, Mass. Santa Fe, N.M. Juneau, Alaska Boston, Mass. Santa Fe, N.M. “We know intuitively that the same plants can’t grow in these places,” Rounsaville says. While Juneau may have relatively temperate winters, it also is extremely wet, averaging over 80 inches of snow a year. Santa Fe, on the other hand, is extremely dry, with much hotter summer temperatures than Juneau. Boston has both temperate winters and summers. It gets a good amount of rain but not nearly enough to sustain Juneau’s rainforest plants. It gets plenty of heat but is colder and wetter in the winter, making it inhospitable for desert dwellers, like cactuses and other succulents. But all three cities rarely get below zero degrees each winter, so they are classified as the same zone. So when you hear that your zone has changed, here are some things to keep in mind: 1 The hardiness map says nothing about your extreme lowest temperature Just because your average lowest winter temperature has changed, doesn’t mean the temperature will never dip below your hardiness zone. scroll For example, the average coldest night of the year in St. Louis, Mo., tends to be around 2º F, meaning that it’s in Zone 7a. Because St. Louis has warmed, it moved up from its previous zone rating of 6b. But notice that this is an average of the coldest temperature St. Louis gets each winter. In the past 30 years, the temperature dropped below Zone 7a in at least 11 different years. In 2014, the temperature dipped three half zones below St. Louis’ hardiness zone, to -10º F. Brrrr! Many common plants that are hardy down to Zone 7, like rosemary, canna lilies or agave, would suffer significant damage or death from those temperatures, especially during a long cold snap. 2 The hardiness map says nothing about the frequency of extreme cold weather Your poor plants have to stay outside all winter, so the duration and frequency of cold weather matters for plant survival. “If you’re naked and you run through a freezer, it’s not going to kill you,” says Andrew Bunting, vice president of horticulture at the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. “If you run into the freezer and have to stay there for an extended period of time, it’s probably going to kill you.” If extreme, out-of-zone weather occurs during a quick cold snap, steps can be taken to protect your plants with temporary blankets or other shelters. Pots can be brought inside. But if the extreme lows persist, tender plants will struggle to survive. Your hardiness zone does not take any of this into account. 3 The hardiness map can’t tell you if your plants will survive the summer Summer temperature extremes matter a great deal but are not reflected in the USDA hardiness map. Let’s look again at Juneau and Santa Fe, much of which are in Zone 7a. Juneau’s all-time high temperature was 90º F in 1975. Summer days in Santa Fe routinely reach the 90s. Some shade- and cool-weather-loving plants like ferns and hostas will thrive in Juneau but struggle mightily in a place like Santa Fe. Likewise, a cactus accustomed to high temperatures would struggle to thrive in the cooler summer temperatures of Juneau, to say nothing of the overwhelming rainfall. Because of this tricky problem, there have been attempts to create a corresponding map that helps gardeners know which plants might survive summer in their area. In 1997, the American Horticultural Society released a heat zone map that measured the average number of times per year that the temperature of an area exceeds 86º F. American Horticultural Society But this map didn’t become well known among gardeners. On a recent visit to a plant nursery outside Washington, D.C., nearly every plant tag had a USDA hardiness zone, but only one, out of the several dozen checked, had the AHS heat zone listed. Above 86º F, plants from cooler climates rapidly become stressed. Because of these complexities, more plant survival factors should be included in the 2023 map, says Tony Avent, who runs Juniper Level Botanic Garden and Plant Delights Nursery in Raleigh, N.C. “If [these metrics] had been factored in, that would have given you a much more applicable map,” says Avent, who was a member of the committee that put together the 2012 version of the map. “And that’s the part that’s a little disappointing.” But including more plant survival factors in the USDA hardiness map runs the risk of creating an overly complicated map and muddying its intended use, Rounsaville says. “In a perfect world, we could infinitely break down where plants will grow well, but that’s very hard to do and produce a map that is, you know, coherent but at a local resolution,” Rounsaville says. Since the USDA plant hardiness zone can’t tell you everything about how a plant will fare in your garden, it’s a good idea to turn to local plant experts for guidance. Local nurseries and botanical gardens can be great resources for in-depth knowledge of the area and recent warming or cooling trends. New plant varieties are constantly being bred with improvements such as increased hardiness, bloom count, bloom length or color combinations. Some nursery owners like Avent enjoy experimenting with these plants. He and his team grow many varieties of plants — both typical and unconventional — to figure out which plants they can bring to market in Raleigh. “We live to kill plants,” Avent says. He estimates that they’ve killed over 50,000 plant varieties in his career. Every one they kill, they record in a database. If my zone changed, can I plant new things now? Maybe, and maybe you already did! It’s possible you or your neighbors may have already noticed some of these climatic changes and have been experimenting with plant varieties that were once unusual for your area. Keep in mind that the new USDA map is backward looking; it represents changes that have already taken place over the past 30 years. In the 7a-7b Philadelphia suburbs, Bunting notes two perennials that he has noticed surviving Philadelphia winters in recent years. “It used to be [that] if you had a camellia, it was in a little courtyard with lots of protection, maybe even wrapped [in protective cloth] for the winter.” But now, “It’s perfectly hardy. Same with figs. People used to wrap figs. You don’t have to do that anymore.” Of course, your mileage may vary. As Bunting notes, where you plant a perennial in your yard — whether sheltered or in the open — matters. Some areas get southern exposure and lots of sun, others are behind a house, or under a tree. Every yard has many distinct microclimates, and learning how to harness these subtle differences in your yard can help you plant more ambitious varieties with more confidence. “Gardeners know that if they’re near paved surfaces or brick and mortar structures, that there’s a lot of radiant heat that those absorb during the day,” Rounsaville says. “And they can really push hardiness zones through the winter to help with plant survival.” Aside from local nurseries and botanic gardens, cooperative extension services can be a great place to find local gardening advice. The extension services are part of a national network of local experts who provide advice on everything from agriculture to gardening. NPR reached out to services in over 30 areas across the country, and many told us about changes they’ve seen in what they can and can’t plant over the past 15 years. ❮ Previous ❯ Next Phoenix Aleppo pines and Arizona ash have shown increased issues in urban environments. [Meanwhile,] plants which are strongly limited by freeze events have benefited from over a decade without severe freezes in some parts of the region. – Michael Chamberland, assistant agent for urban horticulture, University of Arizona, Maricopa County Cooperative Extension Amherst, Mass. Nurseries in western Massachusetts rarely carried Leyland cypress and Japanese cryptomeria but now offer them. There's nothing that I know of that can no longer be grown here due to the warming trend. – Nicholas J. Brazee, extension plant pathologist, University of Massachusetts Amherst Omaha, Neb. Because [the hardiness map]'s based on averages and we live in a part of the country that experiences significant fluctuations in both temperature and precipitation, we’re advising gardeners not to buy more plants for the increased hardiness zone than they can afford to lose. – Dana Freeman, horticulture program coordinator, University of Nebraska Extension, Douglas-Sarpy Counties Denver One thing I’ve noticed in my horticulture career is that “global weirding” — the continental climate variability we have here — does quite a bit to negate the USDA zone changes. I always want what I can’t have and persistently have things perform well even for a few years, only to be killed in late spring freezes. A plant’s ability to prosper somewhere is based upon more than the average winter temperature (i.e., USDA zone). – John Murgel, extension specialist for Douglas County, Colorado State University Minneapolis With the new USDA Plant Hardiness map, our state now recognizes larger areas of Zone 5A, particularly in urban and southwestern areas, supporting a broader palette of plants such as oakleaf hydrangea and Japanese maple that can be grown in these areas. – Brandon Miller, assistant professor; Julie Weisenhorn, extension horticulture educator and associate extension professor, University of Minnesota San Francisco Since our climate is more moderate in climate extremes (highs and lows) vs. say the Midwest or East Coast, these extremes have not necessarily increased significantly other than in duration and period of occurrence. We have noticed that some plants such as Bougainvillea, which might go into winter dormancy and be in jeopardy of damage in a freeze or cold night, no longer go into dormancy and keep many of their leaves throughout the winter. – University of California Cooperative Extension Master Gardeners, San Mateo and San Francisco Counties Dallas The climate change as indicated by the new zone map will have an impact in the South, especially if the area continues to experience droughts. This will result in a shorter growing season. A greater impact may be noticed as you go north, where the area may experience more insect and disease pressure due to mild winters, and a shift in vegetable crops that can be grown. For example, okra is not common in Michigan but may be easily grown with warmer temperatures. This change may also have more impact on fruiting trees such as apples with a minimum chilling hours requirement that will not be met if temperatures continue to stay warmer in the winters. – Joe Masabni, extension vegetable specialist, Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center With that, you have what you need to start a garden.

Some of the updates are due to better accuracy after years of collecting data, but the 800-pound gorilla in the room is climate change. Where I live, winters are 4.5 degrees warmer. It has definitely affected my gardening. reply timr 11 hours agoparentThis update is based on a dataset change that shifts the observation period by 15 years. Buried within a footnote that nobody will ever read: > The 2012 USDA hardiness zones were calculated using the average lowest winter temperature for the observation period of 1976-2005. The new zones are calculated using the years 1991-2020. These two observation windows overlap. Colors show the difference between the two 30-year averages for each place on the map. So while climate change may or may not be the explanation for broader trends in the map, you cannot rule out noise for any particular location, especially given that the methodology uses the lowest winter temperatures in that window as the basis for the zone. That's a fundamentally noisy metric. For example, this drops the blizzard of 1978 -- one of the largest ever in US history -- from the dataset. It's hard to know how that affects the zones without careful inspection, but major weather events like that can easily affect simple outlier analysis. You can see this in the dot plots for Raleigh (the default), which had two outliers in the winters around 1995, and then an otherwise flat series of data. What was the prior dataset? We don't know. Just look at the two default examples: https://imgur.com/a/oZjQ36Y It would only take a small number of cold or warm winters to shift those means in either direction. I don't want to overemphasize a silly little article about plants, but IMO, the fact that NPR buried this information while hyper-focusing on specific locations is just another failure of basic journalism. Telling people that an arbitrarily defined metric has been changed is meaningless, unless you tell people the specific change that was made. It should be the first or second thing they tell you, not buried in a hidden footnote. reply jtbayly 8 hours agorootparentYeah, my location is supposedly 5 degrees warmer, but looking at the data, it’s obviously unchanged except for one outlier winter. reply timr 6 hours agorootparentWere you somehow able to look at the dataset for the prior standard? reply Salgat 19 hours agoparentprevClimate change is rough here in Austin TX because it's getting hotter, but we're also getting more extreme spikes in freezing temperatures. There's a whole slew of plants and trees that can't survive here because of how cold it gets for only a couple days a year. It's not uncommon to lose something like a Palm tree due to one cold day out of the entire year. reply morkalork 18 hours agorootparentI'm in Canada and spring is starting earlier and earlier every year but we will still get blasts of (what used to be normal for that time of year) frost/snow/freezing rain. The problem is with the warm weather, fruit trees will start to bud early and when the cold comes at night it kills all the buds and that's it, no fruit. Last year apple orchards all over lost their crops to this. The instability is what's going to cause chaos in the world. reply steve_adams_86 18 hours agorootparentHave you heard about the damage done to grape and stone fruit crops in BC? It has been happening consistently enough that I expect some vineyards not to exist in the next decade. Even where I am it’s considered a temperate climate and a friend’s grape crops were almost totally destroyed from a snap freeze in late February. He said it wasn’t that uncommon for the freezes to happen when he started, but what changed is how early the vines start budding, like you mentioned. Late-starting crops can bypass this problem, but my understanding is that they often need irrigation because they grow into the tail of summer. That’s not really viable here either, as water’s gradually diminishing from our extended drought. reply morkalork 10 hours agorootparentI'm not out west so I haven't heard about it happening there too. reply adra 17 hours agorootparentprevBC wine industry in some areas purportedly had a crop loss of something like 90% by some estimates. With a 3 year turn around to re-establish the plants, and a very smoke tainted 2021, their industry is certainly in a trouble spot. Let's see if they have enough reserves to sell to get them past this disaster. reply red-iron-pine 11 hours agorootparentnot just smoke tainted, a small bit of Kelowna (the heart of BC wine country) straight up burned down last year https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mcdougall-cr... the whole area is actually surprisingly dry in terms of rain due to being in the rain shadow of the mountain. the lakes nearby make it tolerable, but even a small shift in climate patterns will turn the area into a near-desert. reply randomdata 17 hours agorootparentprevSpring seems like it comes later and later to my eye. When I started farming in Canada we would have the ground prepped in mid-April and were really to start planting May 1st. In the last 5-10 years we struggle to even get on the ground until mid-May. This year is no exception. May 13th already and we have only half of a field planted so far. reply voisin 15 hours agorootparentWhere are you farming? reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agorootparentprevYep, was thinking the same thing. Climate change is also (at least partially) responsible for instability in the polar vortexes that shoot south more often now. Between Winter Storm Uri in Feb 2021 and \"icemageddon\" in Feb 2023 we lost a ton of plants and trees. We have a retaining wall in the back of our property and had a couple giant, cascading rosemary bushes that completely covered the wall - they were so pretty and always smelled amazing. I still get sad thinking about how Uri took those beauties out... reply aftbit 13 hours agorootparentThings like this make me want to install some kind of heaters near my most prized plants. The power cost would be pretty high, and they wouldn't be sufficient to make it through the winter or anything, but they might allow us to weather a night or two of freezing temperatures in the early spring. reply hn_throwaway_99 11 hours agorootparentYou can do this with soil heating cables and plant frost covers. Our problem during winter storm Uri is that the Texas electrical grid almost failed and we had to power for nearly a week in subfreezing temps. reply galangalalgol 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah... Ok, my average temperature increased by %4.x percent, but my variance increased by quite a bit more than that. The assumptions underlying the growing zone approximation were never great ones, but I find the whole idea largely irrelevant now. Cold snaps a good ten degrees below normal have now repeatedly killed established natives (as in you could find them in local wildlife preserves). And the long dry spells averaging what used to be the yearly high, now kill plants adapted to live in actual deserts. Is it wrong that part of me is fascinated to see what comes next? reply voisin 14 hours agorootparent> my average temperature increased by %4.x percent Can you do that with temperatures not in kelvin (with true zero)? reply DangitBobby 12 hours agorootparentIt's not more meaningful in Kelvin. 1 to 4 is a 300% increase and so is 200 to 800. So hearing 300% tells you absolutely nothing, without the added context of \"from the previous average temperature of the region\". reply voisin 11 hours agorootparentMy point is that a 4% increase in numbers on a scale where zero does not equate tot he total absence is not actually 4% hotter. reply smolder 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, it is. Percentages don't mean anything in temperature unless it is Kelvin where 0 is truly 0. 1 to 4 degrees Celsius is not a 300% increase in anything but the integer representing temp. Try that in Fahrenheit or with a negative value. Edit: I think I initially missed your point that percentages are kind of silly to use anyway. reply dragonwriter 10 hours agorootparent> Percentages don’t mean anything in temperature unless it is Kelvin where 0 is truly 0. Well, technically any absolute scale: Kelvin is the most common, but Rankine has the same feature. (It just uses Fahrenheit-sized degrees instead of Celsius-sized.) reply smolder 10 hours agorootparentI wondered if there might be others but left it up to you to correct me. :) reply cozzyd 13 hours agorootparentprevyou can do what you want but it doesn't make it meaningful reply jkestner 18 hours agorootparentprevAlso in Austin.

Things like the late cold snaps people mention in this thread. But: on average, it's warmer almost everywhere. reply scruple 17 hours agorootparent\"Global warming\" is what you get when you let the scientists pick the name. \"Climate change\" is better but you can still get the sense that it's lacking in a solid PR person to figure this out.

Climate Instability sounds sort of clearly bad (I think most people consider instability bad). reply et-al 17 hours agorootparentIf we're workshopping this for you: \"climate change\" has alliteration and is only 3 syllables compared to \"instability\" which has a mouthful of 5 syllables. reply umanwizard 14 hours agorootparentAlliteration has to do with sounds, not letters. reply bee_rider 13 hours agorootparentSomeone else suggested Climate Crisis which is actually alliterative and also sounds bad rather than neutral like “change.” reply SV_BubbleTime 12 hours agorootparentSeems like you are really interested in marketing. reply bee_rider 12 hours agorootparentIt’s just the way the conversation happened to flow.

Maybe there’s some history I’m not aware of. My thought process was: Climate change is mostly bad, but it sounds like a sort of neutral, or even natural process. Environmentalists have done a good job pointing out that it is bad, but the name isn’t doing them any favors. Instability seems to be one of the major side effects and instability is very obviously bad. I guess I’m curious if there’s a “pro-fixing the problem” argument against “climate instability.” By default I’m going to assume that I’m mostly being downvoted by climate deniers. But I’d be happy to be educated otherwise, if there’s a real argument against calling it instability. reply peatmoss 17 hours agorootparentI've written similar comments in other forums and have gotten a similar response. To me, global warming is on average true, but doesn't encompass the full range of negative local impacts. Climate change feels euphemistic compared to climate instability. Like, all things change, so it's chill, right? I like \"instability\" because it feels like the time of chaos and contempt that the scientific consensus tells us we're facing. But... then I realize I'm wordsmithing a problem. While rhetoric is important and all, I think many of our current issues get over-talked and under-actioned. I don't know that the wording is significant relative to other barriers to bringing about change. reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentI think you are right.

It has nothing to do with the beliefs of people at the time, though. This was a time period in which scientists actually improved these technologies and practices, and we stand on the shoulders of that progress. They were doing the best they could with what they had. Geocentrism was also well on the way out 300 years ago. My point is mostly that people in the past did some great work, and having weird beliefs didn’t diminish that.

Your average temperature might only go from -11C to -10C, but if there are 20 additional +0C days, you might end up with a lot less snow cover. reply billyjmc 9 hours agorootparentAnd a reduction in snow cover means a drop in albedo, which raises the average temperate… reply georgeburdell 19 hours agoparentprevSame.

It routinely will go several days at a hard freeze. It very nearly is always at or below freezing at night. I have a CSV of 5-minute granularity temperatures going back several years (at least 5 years). It's gotten to freezing in southern california, in that decade, as well - at night. Growing up there, it never did, but around 2002 or so it got to 30 one night. I have friends in the PNW, utah, colorado, texas. The US has a long cycle, and listening to people who have either moved around a lot or not been alive for more than 1 cycle is funny to me. I enjoy talking to old timers, especially about nature. Prior to 2021, the year everyone made fun of Texans, there was 1 large freeze in the early or mid 2000s, where ice formed on power lines and broke the lines. Prior to that, it hadn't happened for at least 30 years to anyone's recollection. Oh, and i live in a sub-tropical rainforest. It rained exactly 5\" this weekend - i just went and checked.

Getting less and less with an occasional nor'easter here and there. That seems like a regional saying, which translates very poorly to an online global audience. I read winters almost do not exist and assumed you were being more literal than \"there's less snow\". It's snowed here 2-3 times in the last couple decades, each time for maybe a minute or two. I still wouldn't say we don't have a winter. For this area, winter is when it rains. Which is different than summer because there's no rain in the summer, almost ever (maybe one day on average as freak weather). Edit: I seem to have struck a nerve here, but I'm not sure why noting that a particular turn of phrase might be confusing to people from other areas would do so. reply monkburger 18 hours agorootparentOur last big snowstorm was in 2016. Afterwards we were in a snowfall drought for years (well below average) We had a few close calls for big snow, but they never materialized. This is unheard of. Even during strong El Nino patterns, the east coast is supposed to receive good snowfall. It did not happen. Even with a -NAO, -AO, +PNA! reply kbenson 18 hours agorootparentMy point was that in some areas they equate winter with snow, and reduction of snow seems to be interpreted as no winter. If the weather patter is still notably different than summer, it's winter. Equating snow in the current area to winter and lack of it to not being winter is a regional thing. It makes certain statements, like \"winters almost do not exist here\" come across very differently to people in other regions, which what what I was trying to express. For example, my initial interpretation of your early statements in that comment was that you were saying there's little difference between fall and spring from winter, that your winters don't have a noticeable difference to the other seasons. From the rest of your comment it sounds like it's just somewhat milder than it used to be, but still notably different weather pattern. reply unnamed76ri 18 hours agoprevWhen this new map was first released, it was very amusing watching people in gardening Facebook groups start planning to grow plants that have died whenever they tried in the past.

People say this, and it confuses me. Basically the only difference between the two is the absolute numbers and the resolution. Regarding resolution, for me the difference between, say 22 C and 23 C isn’t consistently noticeable - it depends on what I’m wearing, my recent activity level, humidity, etc. having a finer resolution - i.e. between 72 and 73 F isn’t that useful. That is to say, I’d change my plans if it were say 8 C outside instead of 18 C, but I wouldn’t if it were 17 instead of 18. Regarding absolute numbers - sure with Fahrenheit you don’t need to use negative numbers as much, but apparently you still need to across much of the US, and dealing with negative numbers is… fine? Having generally smaller numbers (i.e. most of Earth has natural temperatures of - 40 to +40) is probably better? And having that obvious distinction of when water freezes makes some sense maybe?

After trying to get used to F for 20-some years, I went back and set all my thermometers and online weather maps to Celsius. Farenheit is an absurdly bad scale choice. It is needlessly granular for everyday use and feels wholly arbitrary. 32 degrees is freezing, so how far is 19 F from freezing? 32-19 ... ummm 13 degrees and that is as far as 32+19 ... ummm 51 degrees ... what are we talking about? -10 and +10 Celsius ...

You are completely allowed to have your own opinions ! Although perhaps we have a gap in our language here, since you seem to be against growing vegetables/herbs exclusively rather than what I'd call gardening which includes growing all plants, flowers, etc. Having a 'nice' looking garden (or at least one where you can sit comfortably) is the outcome of that sort of gardening. There are very few vegetables where growing them makes yourself much sense (economically). There are a few where you can 'fire and forget' basically, but even then it's a up-to few hours preparing the soil. In my climate zone, mint would be one - it's basically a weed, so it will grow and spread by itself. Also - you can't get Basil in store where you are? In the UK and Germany it's available either as fresh leaves, or as small plants costing about probably $1-2 each. reply RoyalHenOil 12 hours agorootparentFruit is an area where growing is typically more economical than buying.

No problem, go do something else you enjoy. I personally love to go out into the garden and just be there. I trimmed some branches yesterday because it needed doing but I didn’t go out there to do a chore. I went out because it was beautiful and I wanted to be there. I make a lot of money too and can work whenever. But taking frequent breaks keeps me sharp. I think better when I have some breaks and a few minutes in the garden is refreshing. I’m actually getting more into growing food. I have some ginger sprouting on my counter and can’t wait to find a home for it in the yard. The plum trees are captivating, we had a spectacular apple year last year. There’s something calm and sweet about going out to the tree, picking apples and turning them into a pie. To each his own though. I’d never push my hobbies on someone else or challenge anyone who started to find one of theirs unfulfilling. reply lupusreal 20 hours agorootparentprevI've found that growing heirloom tomatos is essentially effort-free; they keep coming back year after year without me having to do anything but pick them before the rats get to them.

More work for farmers to figure out yield optimization (new schedules, changed techniques), more work from pests moving into new areas that were formerly blocked by seasonal cold. It’s a driver of increased cost pressure on foods you will want to buy. reply CalRobert 20 hours agoparentprevMy wife and I spent a few years with a few acres of land in Ireland and went hard on gardening, at one point providing all of our veg ourselves. But now that we've left we don't miss it. It was fun while it was novel, though, and our kids learned a lot about where food comes from, which is nice. It also tends to involve a huge amount of plastic, weirdly, and pests are a big issue. reply FredPret 19 hours agorootparentI think the vast majority of plastic use happens before the consumer sees the product. I remember seeing my first pallet wrapper. It’s very cool but there’s a lot of plastic there.

To start, you put black plastic on the ground to block light and kill off grass, weeds, etc.. Then there's plastic plant \"fabric\" on the plants at night to keep them warm, then plastic netting over plants to stop birds from eating the berries, and of course the polytunnel (called a hoop houses in some places) itself is made of thick plastic, and it will break down over time due to UV. All of this plastic degrades and turns in to microplastics in the environment. It's tiny by comparison but I always found it annoying that a strimmer is designed to just throw entire spools of plastic in to your garden one tiny piece at a time.

Sometimes he's astounded, other times less so. The things that astound Franklin aren't always what you might think at first. Electric streetlamps are a superb invention, and while I think Franklin would be very pleased to see them, I don't think he would be surprised. Better street lighting was something everyone wanted in Franklin's time, and this was something very much on Franklin's mind. It was certainly clear that electricity could be turned into light. Franklin could have and might have thought up the basic mechanism of an incandescent bulb himself, although he wouldn't have been able to make one. The Internet? Well, again yes, but no. The complicated engineering details are complicated engineering, but again the basic idea is easily within the reach of the 18th century and is not all that astounding. They hadn't figured out Oersted's law yet, which was crucial, but they certainly knew that you could do something at one end of a long wire and it would have an effect at the other end, and had an idea that that might be a way to send messages from one place to another. Wikipedia says that as early as 1753 people were thinking that an electric signal could deflect a ping-pong ball at the receiving end. It might have worked! If you look into the history of transatlantic telegraph cables you will learn that the earliest methods were almost as clunky. Wikipedia itself is more impressive. The universal encyclopedia has long been a dream, and now we have one. It's not always reliable, but you know what? Not all of anything is reliable. An obvious winner, something sure to blow Franklin's mind is “yeah, we've sent people to the Moon to see what it was like, they left scientific instruments there and then they came back with rocks and stuff.” But that's no everyday thing, it blew everyone's mind when it happened and it still does. Some things I tell Franklin make him goggle and say “We did what?” and I shrug modestly and say yeah, it's pretty impressive, isn't it. The Moon thing makes me goggle right back. The Onion nailed it. The really interesting stuff is the everyday stuff that makes Franklin goggle. CAT scans, for example. Ordinary endoscopy will interest and perhaps impress Franklin, but it won't boggle his mind. (“Yeah, the doctor sticks a tube up your butt with an electric light so they can see if your bowel is healthy.” Franklin nods right along.) X-rays are more impressive. (I wrote a while back about how long it took dentists to start adopting X-ray technology: about two weeks.) But CAT scans are mind-boggling. Oh yeah, we send invisible rays at you from all directions, and measure how much each one was attenuated from passing through your body, and then infer from that exactly what must be inside and how it is all arranged. We do what? And that's without getting into any of the details of whether this is done by positron emission or nuclear magnetic resonance (whatever those are, I have no idea) or something else equally incomprehensible. Apparently there really is something to this quantum physics nonsense. So far though the most Franklin-astounding thing I've found has been GPS. The explanation starts with “well, first we put 32 artificial satellites in orbit around the Earth…”, which is already astounding, and can derail the conversation all by itself. But it just goes on from there getting more and more astounding: “…and each one has a clock on board, accurate to within 40 nanoseconds…” “…and can communicate the exact time wirelessly to the entire half of the Earth that it can see…” “… and because the GPS device also has a perfect clock, it can compute how far it is from the satellite by comparing the two times and multiplying by the speed of light…” “… and because the satellite also tells the GPS device exactly where it is, the device can determine that it lies on the surface of a sphere with the satellite at the center, so with messages from three or four satellites the device can compute its exact location, up to the error in the clocks and other measurements…” “…and it fits in my pocket.” And that's not even getting into the hair-raising complications introduced by general relativity. “It's a bit fiddly because time isn't passing at the same rate for the device as it is for the satellites, but we were able to work it out.” What. The. Fuck. Of course not all marvels are good ones. I sometimes explain to Franklin that we have gotten so good at fishing — too good — that we are in real danger of fishing out the oceans. A marvel, nevertheless. A past what-the-fuck was that we know exactly how many cells there are (959) in a particular little worm, C. elegans, and how each of those cells arises from the division of previous cells, as the worm grows from a fertilized egg, and we know what each cell does and how they are connected, and we know that 302 of those cells are nerve cells, and how the nerve cells are connected together. (There are 6,720 connections.) The big science news on Friday was that for the first time we have done this for an insect brain. It was the drosophila larva, and it has 3016 neurons and 548,000 synapses. Today I was reading somewhere about how most meteorites are asteroidal, but some are from the Moon and a few are from Mars. I wondered “how do we know that they are from Mars?” but then I couldn't understand the explanation. Someday maybe. And by the way, there are only 277 known Martian meteorites. So today's what-the-fuck is: “Yeah, we looked at all the rocks we could find all over the Earth and we noticed a couple hundred we found lying around various places looked funny and we figured out they must have come from Mars. And when. And how long they were on Mars before that.” Obviously, It's amazing that we know enough about Mars to be able to say that these rocks are like the ones on Mars. (“Yeah, we sent some devices there to look around and send back messages about what it was like.”) But to me, the deeper and more amazing thing is, from looking at billions of rocks, we have learned so much about what rocks are like that we can pick out, from these billions, a couple of hundred that came to the Earth not merely from elsewhere but specifically from Mars. What. The. Fuck. Addendum 20240513 I left out one of the most important examples! Even more stunning than GPS. When I'm going into the supermarket, I always warn Franklin “Okay, brace yourself. This is really going to blow your mind.” [Other articles in category /tech] permanent link",

I wouldn’t be surprised if he was playing it up a bit. I don't think so. People don't realize how bad it was in the Soviet Union. There's a story of two hockey players that came to the NHL. One went to the grocery store, he was completely taken back by how much was there, especially meat. He thought it was a mistake and didn't want to miss the opportunity so he bought it all up. He called his friend who also recently defected to the NLH, and his friend said \"Same thing happened here!\" reply Tuna-Fish 12 hours agorootparentThe meat thing was not an isolated incident. Finland had close enough relationship with the USSR that for the duration of the cold war, there were constantly some Soviet students and research scientists doing exchange programs in Finnish universities. When they first arrived in Finland, they were assigned a translator/guide whose job was, among other things, taking them grocery shopping. Because if they did that alone, a lot of them would end up buying their fridge full of meat. Because \"meat days\", meaning the day the local store happens to have meat, just were a normal thing that everyone adjusted to in the USSR. reply mcswell 5 hours agorootparentprevThere is a story about a man who goes to a shop in the Soviet Union, and finds the shelves empty. \"Don't you have any meat?\" he asks the clerk. The clerk responds, \"No, here we don't have any fish. The store that doesn't have any meat is across the street.\" reply agumonkey 13 hours agorootparentprevAlso, it's easy to take basic necessities for granted. Only when you experienced hunger you realise how having plenty of affordable food is a luxury. reply brightball 12 hours agorootparentprevPeople used to tell stories of visiting Russia and having people try to buy their blue jeans off of them while walking down the street. reply toss1 12 hours agorootparentYes, can confirm. I personally know multiple people who have had that exact experience; one just mentioned it last weekend. If they knew in advance they traveled with an extra suitcase full of jeans to sell, not so much for the money, but to make/help friends. It was also not uncommon for Soviet residents to queue up for whatever anyone was selling when it became available — Size 14 galoshes that will not even close to fit you? Get in line, buy as many as they'll sell you. You can sell/trade them later for something else. I've also been in situations with live hyperinflation, like 10% per week. The strategies people came up with to deal with that were also amazing. In the modern western societies, most people have literally zero idea of how far (or fast) things can go off the rails, or what that looks like. It is a great privilege to live in such profound blissful ignorance, and it is not appreciated. reply marcosdumay 11 hours agorootparent> I've also been in situations with live hyperinflation, like 10% per week. I don't know if it's because I have experienced it, but 10%/week inflation doesn't sound anything near as bleak as \"basic necessities are only available every other month\". reply taneq 11 hours agorootparentGive it six months and you’ll understand. Basic necessities are available for money, until they aren’t because money stops working. Edit: Six months of 10%/wk hyperinflation, I meant, not that some crazy hyperinflation is going to hit you personally within six months. reply marcosdumay 9 hours agorootparentWhat are you talking about? Hyperinflation is the one I have experienced. reply toss1 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, while I did not go to the USSR, the accounts I've heard from friends definitely sounded worse than hyperinflation.

Anyway, it's just a weird argument in general. Authoritarian systems are bad, of course, but authoritarianism cuts across planned-vs-market economies, and the hallowed corporate boardroom is the epitome of central planning. What matters is not markets vs state charter, but being allowed to fail, and without it (say) Boeing is no different than the stuffiest soviet OKB, despite the fact boeing is a \"free market\" company. And when these arguments eventually devolve into people citing the dead nazis who died attempting to annex other countries as \"victims of socialism\", well... and again, you can say \"tu quoque\" all you want, but if a practice is so widely accepted as to be unremarkable then it's unremarkable. And the victims of capitalism are never brought up quite as readily - there's no PR machine spinning for the dead irish peasants, or someone who dies of a treatable chronic illness, or who spends their life in an american gulag for a trivial offense, etc. We got plenty of authoritarianism here too, and it sucks here too, but that's not the angle people bring it up in... literally ever. It's just our elites winding us up against whatever elites our elites are opposed to this week. The fact of the matter is that as automation displaces not just physical but also intellectual labor to greater and greater degrees, we are going to have to move away from the idea that people's intrinsic value is only what they contribute to the economy (market or state). Non-authoritarian socialism is pretty great and yes, I'll happily take the ticket to Norway and leave you alone. reply emmelaich 8 hours agorootparentSuch a patina of reasonableness to your comment but your comparison of the Irish famine to the Holomodor is way overwrought. Holomodor was deliberate and largely not caused by bad harvests. Irish had the potato blight; and in the beginning they were given a large amount of charity. WRT authoritarianism, govt have a monopoly on violence that individual companies will never have. reply Aexian 7 hours agorootparentIn defence of the comparison - it is not at all a consensus that the Holodomor was deliberate from the beginning, that’s an active debate with prominent experts on both sides. In both famines, there was a refusal to intervene to alleviate the famine once it had begun, and in both cases that was unequivocally a deliberate choice of the British/Soviet leadership. Further - there are many cases through history of companies steering the state violence, from Colonial India to Blair Mountain to Aaron Swartz. The broad point here is that the Soviet Union is constantly used in our Western discourse for our own brand of whataboutism. Our systems fail people constantly and brutally. Our supermarket shelves are stocked, but most of the Anglosphere is in the grips of an unprecedented housing crisis. There’s absolutely lessons we can learn from the Soviets in housing policy, but we won’t if any mention of them ends up reduced back to their worst failures. They didn’t get their shelves stocked by talking about MKUltra or smallpox blankets all day. You can argue that the grass is greener overall, but there’s still dead patches all over our lawn. That’s the broader point. reply adolph 7 hours agorootparentprevNot to disagree with you but to add context, the monopoly on violence has not always been as straightforward as one might imagine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain The British East India company’s operations are another example. reply emmelaich 3 hours agorootparentI completely agree with you but my point stands as is. I'd only change 'never have' to 'almost never have' and most probably won't again. reply 7thaccount 5 hours agorootparentprevEcon teacher who went to Russia a lot used to talk about this a lot. reply emmelaich 8 hours agorootparentprevTwo stories I heard recently; the Soviet Union tried some propaganda by showing people the movie 'Grapes of Wrath' and also saying people had to eat cat food to live. Actual Russian reactions: 1. even the poor own trucks?! 2. they have special food for .. cats?! reply momojo 7 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of a friend who taught 6th grade at a low-income school in LA-County. Before, she was rationed two (2) reams of paper a month. Upon transferring to a much more well-funded school, the other teachers had to talk her down from hoarding the unlimited reams in the break room. reply szszrk 5 hours agorootparentMy wife is a teacher and gets one ream per semester. In total, for all classes she teaches. It's geography for 10-14 year olds, so a lot of practice and tests of map usage and so on. Being a teacher here is definitely a mission, not a career. You just have to have a \"sponsor\" to participate (often this means husband), you can't just live on your salary. reply orthoxerox 18 hours agorootparentprevThere's still a difference between the stores having meat on their shelves and the stores having every kind of meat on their shelves. And every kind of vegetable, every kind of drink, every kind of cheese as well. reply ramblenode 17 hours agorootparentIf you think the average American supermarket has every kind of meat, cheese, drink, and vegetable, you are in for a big surprise traveling the world. In many ways American markets have fallen behind relatively poorer countries in variety. Most of what is sold are monocultures and packaged foods. The selection of fresh produce (or any produce) is often disappointing. reply vundercind 7 hours agorootparentI think we’re backsliding on choice, if anything. It gets even worse if you look at packaged stuff. “Look, twelve brands of coffee!” but actually it’s three because some of them are owned by the others, or by the same parent company. reply MisterBastahrd 16 hours agorootparentprevYep. For example, one staple dish of Cajuns is called \"rice and gravy.\" Essentially, you sear thinly cut 7-steaks, remove them, cook down some trinity, then add the steaks back with some water or broth and seasonings. That's it. The steaks simmer in the broth for hours and create their own gravy. We serve it over rice, usually accompanied by some roux peas (tres petit pois cooked in a roux with onions and bacon) and cornbread. Simple, easy, flavorful. But I live in Texas now, home of all the cattle, if you believe the marketing. And I can't find 7-steaks unless I go to a Mexican meat market, because the DFW area is so bourgeois nowadays that the steaks simply don't pass muster for the local market. Hell, I'm more likely than not to end up in a Mexican market simply because the produce is better and cheaper. Same with beef shank. Osso bucco is traditionally made with veal shank, and oxtails are all the rage, but I can't find beef shank unless I go to an HEB. Most places don't carry the cut. And if I couldn't find beef shank, I could always go with beef neckbones, but uh... HEB is the only place around me that sells that either. reply rmccue 14 hours agorootparentAs someone who’s not American, I’m unclear; is going to a butcher not an option? Have they been competed out of the market by supermarkets? reply chasd00 13 hours agorootparentfrom a google search: \"A 7 bone steak is a cut of beef from the chuck section of a cow's front shoulder, which is considered a tough area of the animal.\". You're not going to find that in a regular grocery store because not many people will buy it. You will find every other cut of beef, pork, and poultry considered edible though. You can go to a butcher but they're less common than a regular grocery store. Also, butchers usually have less selection since they're a smaller operation. EDIT: i live in Dallas, Texas and \"HEB\" is just another brand of grocery store so \"having to go to HEB\" just means having to go to the grocery store. reply jandrewrogers 12 hours agorootparentIn most places I've lived, including Seattle, butchers typically buy the whole animal. They move smaller quantities but every possible cut of meat is available, you just have to ask. They may run out of a cut, since availability scales with the number animals they butcher and demand is uneven over the entire animal, or you might want something unusual outside the scope of their default breakdown of the animal, but you can always ask them to reserve that part from the next animal and they've always been happy to oblige in my experience. reply rmccue 12 hours agorootparentprev> Also, butchers usually have less selection since they're a smaller operation. That’s curious; I’d have thought you’d have more selection since the butcher is, y’know, doing the butchering, so any cut is possible.

Because when I want to talk about food issues, I \"boast\" by talking about the scarcity of what is perceived to be a lower quality cut of meat near my location, and how I'm driving to find a shop in a poorer neighborhood to meet my food demands.

You probably won't find it at butchers either. Independent butchers aren't all that uncommon. Though, for example, my town has 3-4 grocers that sell meat without having a counter (but I expect you could talk to the butcher at a couple of them), a grocer that does have a counter, and then a couple of independent butchers. reply prawn 7 hours agorootparentDuck probably isn't eaten here all that much, but at my local supermarket there'd be breasts, Peking Duck flavoured breasts, confit legs, and another Peking Duck kit. In that not-overly-large shopping complex, there are two supermarkets (one of which has loads of European smallgoods, like 40+ types of cheese) and also: independent greengrocer, butcher, fishmonger, bulk grains store, bakery chain, etc. Used to be a poultry-specialist butcher too. Most shopping centres I can think of here will have an independent butcher, plus more separately outside those.

We would go to the kolkhoz market for vegetables and my parents had a literal backroom deal with a grocery store manager to get beef, but the shelves were conspicuously barren. Going from this to a country where any random supermarket would have chicken, several cuts of beef, several cuts of pork, tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, onions, several sorts of cheese and was not at risk of running out of any position would have been a shock. reply Ferret7446 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's hard to appreciate how much we take for granted the things we are accustomed to. reply dotnet00 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I do take it with a grain of salt since it's a very convenient propaganda story, and it'd be a stretch to say that he formed his political platform just 2 years before actually being elected. reply Jensson 18 hours agorootparentYou can think something is better without believing that they are as much better as they claim to be. reply dotnet00 18 hours agorootparentI'd consider that to be implied.

I think it is important since we as humans capable of conscious transformation of production relations. In some parts of production may be it is ok if it is done by independent agents, in some parts it could be better if agents could communicate not just by market, but directly, as with free softwere/GPL where you can directly work on it, not though market. What is good about USSR, is that you could likely get any schematic of any device. I do not like proprietay things so this huge market of phones and etc, is not really for me. Some ICs used do not have datasheets. The many supermarkets, it is 10 or so in radius of 1-2 km here. I'm ok if it is 7 and one lab equiped with electronics, etc equipment.

Arguably, the American revolution wasn't even necessary. A lot of people died as a result. England would have potentially ended slavery decades earlier if the US was still a colony.

Often times, but not always, this is married to a both a doomsday-prepper I-can-go-it-alone mentality, as well as a libertarian theory of government. reply keybored 15 hours agorootparentThere are currently many different extremist groups out there. So I don’t know why you went with that. reply petsfed 15 hours agorootparentBecause unlike other kinds of extremist, violent, revolutionary political movements, those from the accelerationist + prepper mindset are explicitly opposed to modern life. Think Ted Kaczynski (that is, the Unabomber). Not all violent extremists are focused on tearing down the modern technological order. ISIS, for instance, is only interested in the end of modern morality, but (evidently, based on their PR/recruiting arm) have no special qualms with modern media technology, industrialization, etc. The Red Army Faction was only opposed to the modern (at the time) government of Germany and a poorly defined concept of capitalism.

How much should we sacrifice so that blueberries exist year round? reply mtalantikite 19 hours agorootparentMy problem with it is that not only are we paying the environmental cost to have berries all year round in the grocery store, it's that they're also just shit quality. Like not just passable, but are bitter and sour and not worth it at all. And it's sort of at the expense of really good, local berries when the real season hits. For example, I live in Brooklyn and the grocery stores last summer barely had any local blueberries from New Jersey. Everything was Driscolls branded berries, and they're always bad. They look like berries, but they taste awful, or at best like nothing, 95% of the time. I don't know much about the market, but I wouldn't be surprised if they had a year long contract and the local producers get shut out during the real season. Luckily there are farmers markets and CSAs near me. reply rrr_oh_man 18 hours agorootparentThis so much. People who live in Western cities have no fucking clue what fruits and vegetables are supposed to taste like. It’s like a running gag that my father complains about supermarket tomatoes, but after travelling through rural places in Eastern and Southern Europe and a little bit in Central America, I totally get it. reply mtalantikite 16 hours agorootparentOh, same with my father. He would tell stories about going to the markets in Algeria when he was a kid and how it was totally normal to have fruit sellers cut into a melon right then and there to give you a sample. If it sucked you just wouldn't buy it, so there was always competition for having the best produce in the market. And this was him complaining to me about poor quality produce in the US when I was a kid in the 80s and 90s -- the quality has only gotten worse since then. Food just tastes better in other countries. reply lotsofpulp 15 hours agorootparent> Food just tastes better in other countries. This should be corrected to fruit and vegetables taste better in regions where they are grown. Which is obvious, because picking them before they are ripe and transporting them thousands of kilometers for days or weeks is going to yield a less tasty fruit or vegetable. Also, plants bred for longevity of their fruit will obviously not be optimizing for taste. reply mtalantikite 13 hours agorootparentSure, maybe! Although I've generally found that the overall quality of ingredients tends to be better in the places I've traveled compared to the US. That's not to say I haven't picked up great figs at a bodega in the mission, or don't get good berries at the farmers markets near me in NYC. But if I walk into the produce aisle in most grocery stores in the US these days there is abundance, yet a lack of quality. Personally, when it comes to fresh produce, I'd rather only be able to eat mostly what can be grown in season somewhat close to me (which would include greenhouses), rather than be able to get anything all year round and having it suck. reply jandrewrogers 12 hours agorootparentAs a general rule, fruits and vegetables are much better quality on the US west coast because so much of it is produced locally. The difference in produce quality is quite noticeable. In the parts of Europe where I've spent a lot of time, the average vegetable quality and selection is noticeably worse than e.g. Seattle, but that mostly reflects the Pacific Northwest being a major high-quality producer of surprisingly diverse fruit and vegetables. reply mtalantikite 7 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, west coast has better produce in general than we do here in NYC. No argument there. reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentprevTomatoes are probably about the worst example you could pick. Fresh tomatoes can be excellent (though I'm really not a tomato aficionado) during the short period when they're in season locally in much of the US. Outside that period, the recommendation for cooking tomatoes is generally to use canned because tomatoes are an example of something that doesn't ship well. reply petsfed 16 hours agorootparentWhen I worked for an indoor-ag company whose big deal was picking varietals for flavor, rather than ability to travel across the country, I always pointed to how much tomatoes had changed in my lifetime as to why travel-ready produce was a problem. Remember when toothbrush advertising demonstrated how the brush was so soft it wouldn't affect a tomato, let alone your gums? That demonstration makes no sense now. reply wumbo 17 hours agorootparentprevThat’s why they’re the best example. Grow your own and the difference is extreme between that and a mealy, flavorless storebought reply ghaff 17 hours agorootparentThat assumes you care enough about tomatoes to grow them.

You really have to define what you mean by \"supposed to taste like.\" As in \"supposed to taste like what occurs in nature without human intervention\" is very different than \"supposed to taste like after humans have spent generations cultivating them to be the sweetest variety\" which is different than \"supposed to taste like when they are cultivated to optimize for logistics.\" I suspect what you're referring to with the tomatoes is the last example, because they have been grown and picked to best withstand transit. reply kasey_junk 10 hours agorootparentprevOf course Westerners know what fruits and vegetables are supposed to taste like. We can in fact grow them and do. Where the problem lies is the changes made to fruits and vegetables to make them last the long journeys that they have to make from places that have longer growing seasons or cheaper labor. Try a locally grown heirloom tomato in the summer in the American Midwest and you’ll get a phenomenal tasting fruit. More interestingly, try a bunch. It will be hard to say what a tomato is supposed to taste like because of the variety in flavors that come from location and breed. reply bbarnett 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat gets me, is people don't understand. Stuff is often in season in the US, and at that time, it's generally good in the supermarket. Then there's when it's not in season. Contrast green beans shipped from 1500km away on a boat, arriving 2 weeks to a month later at the store, kept \"fresh\" by all sorts of waxy residue, and other \"agents\" sprayed on them with .... green beans canned within 2 hours of being picked. Where I grew up, in a rural area, we had a local canning plant. They'd get farmers to plan to harvest on a schedule, and they'd literally be canning as the farmer drive trucks up with produce. No joke, they were canned within 2 hours, often faster, and that's how it's done these days. Which has more vitamins? Which has more nutrition? I'd lay a bet that the canned stuff is far better, far better than something that has artificial stuff sprayed on it so it looks good (artifical 'wax', and various chemicals to keep it \"fresh\"), and spent weeks getting to the supermarket.

Buying local makes a lot more sense if you live in a farming community than a port city. reply VelesDude 10 hours agorootparentIn a previous job, I did the math for shipping goods from Melbourne to Perth here in Australia via freight train. It worked out to be 1 litre of fuel per ton moved 500km. In imperial, that is 1 ton at 930MPG!

But we have relatively efficient industrial scale farming in the US as well, if we admitted that blueberries are seasonal we could grow them in big efficient farms and then just ship them less far. reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentA lot of fruits freeze pretty well too. When I'm in Maine at the right time of year and big boxes of \"wild\" local (low-bush) blueberries are for sale, often they're already frozen.

I would be surprised if the cost would go up more than 20% if we had a proper carbon tax in place. At least after the market adapts. reply bee_rider 18 hours agorootparentYeah, a carbon tax is the way to go.

I have blueberry bushes in my yard, they were like $5. i put them in the ground and then ignored them for years. It is true that not every piece of land can do what i did here, but these sweeping \"marvel at the advance of farming\" ideas are silly to me. I had a peach, plum, orange, and fig tree in my back yard growing up in california. When we sold the house the new owners tore them down. I think that's sad. Fresh, free fruit every year? Now, growing enough of one thing to be able to sell it to turn a profit might have \"greater externality\" but even that might not be true depending on the methods used. There are composting farms where people bring their refuse - specifically \"anything that was alive recently\" can go in the compost, and this will provide nutrients and soil amendments in a sustainable way to that farm, which can then provide nutrition to the community it serves. You can't feed the planet with a small, self-sustaining farm. But this idea that it's a net negative needs to DIAF. reply anonporridge 17 hours agorootparentprevThere's no intrinsic reason why it can't be. It entirely depends on how many externalities are created as debt to the future in order to ship blueberries around the world.

The future we should all be striving for is one of extreme abundance for everyone, not forcing everyone into hair shirts. reply RecycledEle 16 hours agorootparentprev> Shipping blueberries around the world can’t be great for the environment. Look at the price to ship something. The cost of fuel burned can not be greater than the shipping cost, and it is probably much less. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentThe cost of fuel could be higher than the shipping cost, if we include things like: * the cost of cleaning up all the carbon we’ve spewed out * the cost of fossil fuel subsidies * the political cost of doing business with oil producing countries, many of which seem to be fairly hostile reply RecycledEle 16 hours agorootparentprev> But at what cost? How much should we sacrifice so that blueberries exist year round? Look at the price tag on the blueberries. That is the cost.

It took an enormous, global pandemic to cause a disruption and even then, goods kept flowing. Don't forget, Everyone braced for an economic downturn and all of a sudden demand for transported goods shot up. That's what caused the congestion, hugely growing demand. Containers never stopped moving, demand for transport was simply greater than supply. Prices rose, sure, but that's what's supposed to happen right? After the pandemic was over prices plummeted even faster than they climbed and are now under pre-pandemic levels. Right now containers ships have (largely) stopped transiting the Suez Canal, passing the Horn of Africa instead. Adding weeks to their transit time.

Clearing the land for farming? The Company des Indes gave them each a pickaxe, a hoe, and a spade. The progenitor of the Folse family in particular cleared the land, then became ill with malarial fever all summer, and then a hurricane flooded his property. 2 years after his arrival, he managed to harvest an entire 7 barrels worth of rice, which he had to hand-transport from the Hahnville area of modern day St. Charles Parish to New Orleans for sale. One of the reasons the people there had such good relationships with the local native Americans (and why Creole Louisiana is such a melting pot to this day) is that they didn't have time to focus on procuring meat, so instead they would trade their crops with the natives, while the natives went hunting for meat and taught the children how to hunt, too. reply petesergeant 20 hours agoparentprev> would blow the minds I think there are two aspects to this.

Not to mention that if space flight were commonly available and cheap today (more feasible than you seem to think - remember computers were once phenomenally expensive and now they're so cheap as to be thrown away), more could experience the overview effect, the cognitive shift that comes when you see Earth hanging in the void of space. That would probably make humanity better to each other and our planet. Or what about the fact that the Apollo program basically launched our discipline of computer science?

We would have gotten there, and we did, but the Apollo program had stuff like the first fly-by-wire vehicle. That's a great invention! reply Nevermark 13 hours agorootparentprevIt remained staggeringly expensive because the Space Shuttle was a disastrous design to follow up the lunar rockets. It held up the space program half a century in some ways. It reduced the manned program to Earth orbit, was supposed to be highly reusable to reduce launch costs, but didn't work out that way. And of course, it was supposed to be reliable and safer. If we had continued going to the moon, even infrequently, or aimed further, we would have had no choice but to actually achieve reusability, safety and reliability much sooner. (In the meantime, ... NASA's current manned program isn't better. Multi-billion dollar throw away rockers. Good thing someone validated reusable first stages and space craft, and is working to eliminate non-reusable second stages.) reply paulryanrogers 10 hours agorootparentIt's also possible that materials science (and others) were too immature and could not be rushed without innovations in a million other areas. The tradeoffs needed across all fields may be worse for society, or just impossible until the global population could produce enough skilled workers. reply philistine 4 hours agorootparentNope. The Shuttle was a catastrophic strategic blunder. Why do you think NASA is so adamant on chasing a second vehicle to go to the ISS when A) The ISS is nearly over; and B) Space X's vehicle is awesome? Because of the Shuttle. Initially, and they actually did it for a couple of years, EVERY satellite launched into orbit by the US was supposed to use the Shuttle. Inevitably, when the Shuttle proved inadequate at all its jobs, they had to revert back to rockets. That's not a failure of materials science. That's a strategic mistake that could have been avoided. reply dotnet00 19 hours agorootparentprevWhile I can understand that as a reason for not sending crew there, we didn't even send uncrewed landers. The result being that now our technology has changed so much that we have to relearn how to autonomously land there. If we had been sending the occasional lander, we would've smoothly transitioned from the technology of then to the technology of now. reply somenameforme 19 hours agoparentprevRe: Moon landing - It had very little to do with people losing interest. In 1972 Nixon defacto completely cancelled the human space program, which he had been rapidly stripping away since Apollo 13. He was paranoid that a catastrophic failure was imminent and would negatively affect his 1972 election campaign. Interestingly when he signed off on the final stripping down in 1972, he remarked that we may never set foot on the Moon again this century. That would've sounded quite absurd at the time, but was ultimately completely correct. It's kind of ironic that the stereotypical context of the space race was it supposedly having been a proxy for an ideological battle between capitalism and communism. Yet the US space program existed solely and exclusively due to a large and heavily centralized governmental effort. It's only in very modern times that private companies can take to the stars, completely independent of governments, which is why we've been able to make vastly made more progress in the past 10 years than we did in the 40 prior. A good starting point off for going down this rabbit hole would probably be here. [1] [1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canceled_Apollo_missions reply dotnet00 19 hours agorootparentThat covers the cancellation of Apollo, but the fact that we didn't even put an uncrewed lander on the Moon within the 50 years in between is indicative of a lack of general interest, since we've had several presidents in these 50 years. Still, this did lead me to the discovery that apparently the often made claim that viewership of the landings waned after Apollo 11 doesn't seem to have any clear evidence besides the point that Apollo 11 had the highest live viewer count until apparently the most recent Superbowl. The EVA camera was damaged in Apollo 12, and 13 was just poorly covered by the media until the crew encountered trouble. reply somenameforme 17 hours agorootparentI don't think what happens in politics is a great proxy for interest. Lots of things with high interest levels never happen - federal digital privacy laws or federal right to repair laws for instance. And, vice versa, lots that are exceptionally unpopular get passed with exceptional rapidity - spying laws and copyright lasting until the heat death of the universe laws are a couple of examples there. Most polls since the end of the Apollo program have shown strong and growing interest in space. Here's [1] the most recent I could find - a 2018 Pew poll. 72% consider it essential that the US continue to be a world leader in space exploration, 80% agree that the ISS has been a good investment for the country, 63% consider it important (45%) or top priority (18%) to send astronauts to Mars, and so on.

Are there any private companies putting humans in space without huge government grants, launch facilities, or ex-gov talent? reply oconnor663 8 hours agorootparentThis is all deeply hypothetical (and I'm super biased), but I think it's important to distinguish two different questions: - Is it possible for a private company to make it to space without government money? - Is it possible to do that while competing with other companies that do get the money? Observing that \"company ___ would not have succeeded without government money\" is answering the second question but maybe not the first. reply dotnet00 15 hours agorootparentprevThe 'huge government grants' thing is doing a lot of (excuse the pun) heavy lifting, as are launch facilities and ex-gov talent. The government is a customer on Crew Dragon, it's a government 'grant' if you consider it a grant when the government pays money to a company for stationary specifically designed for the government (say, with the respective agency's logo on it). Similarly, the launch facilities are being leased and heavily customized by private companies for their requirements. You can't just prop up a launch complex anywhere, and the best spots are where the government owned ones have been built already. Ex-gov talent is similarly complicated because there is obviously a lot of exchange between NASA and industry, especially since the space industry is growing rapidly and has high barriers to entry constraining talent availability. For example, a lot of smaller new space companies are founded by people who have previously worked at SpaceX, but it'd be weird to say that those companies are not independent of SpaceX just because that's where their founders previously gained their industry credentials from. The important point in terms of independence is that during Apollo, NASA dictated the design in detail to companies, the company's job was to build what NASA told them to, then NASA would take ownership of it all and be responsible for running the show. The companies couldn't choose to do whatever they wanted with the designs. Now, with independent private space exploration, NASA just presents its requirements (safety, destination, crew, payload, availability etc). Companies present their proposals, NASA decides which ones fit its requirements best and promises them fixed payments for achieving specific milestones. The risk of cost overruns, failures etc is entirely on the company. The design is developed primarily by the company, and it belongs to them, NASA is essentially just along for the ride like any passenger. reply paulryanrogers 14 hours agorootparentI'd still say that's not \"completely independent\". One might even say it's just outsourcing NASA's once many teams to different companies. Also I doubt these companies would be as numerous or as big without the promise of fat government contracts looming on the horizon. reply somenameforme 8 hours agorootparentIn 2023 SpaceX launched commercial (in other words excluding experimental/starship stuff) 96 times including 7 times for NASA. NASA played a critical role in SpaceX's early founding, where their first contract with NASA is effectively what enabled the company to exist. But I would also emphasize that such wasn't just serendipity. SpaceX's entire initial concept was built around said NASA contract, because it existed. If it didn't then they obviously would have been pitching to e.g. telecoms companies or whatever. But since then they've increasingly just become another customer, though certainly a VIP customer! As for talent, launching stuff is not really NASA's competency in modern times. After the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 until SpaceX entered the picture in 2020, the one and only way we got to the ISS was by relying on Russia. The SLS [2] was NASA's effort at creating a new launch vessel and it's just been a complete failure that was already been obsoleted by the Falcon Heavy years ago. SLS's expected cost per flight is $2billion+. So you're looking at up to twice the theoretic payload for 20x+ the cost. If not for corruption/graft, that rocket would have long since been cancelled and would certainly never fly a single mission. And I'm completely ignoring Starship here!

[2] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System reply hnbad 17 hours agorootparentprevThis reminds me of how the sad state of fiber broadband in Germany is ultimately the result of 1990s chancellor Helmut Kohl (the one who saw over the reunification, consequently selling off the East German public property to private investors for scraps) thinking that public TV was too hostile to him and wanting to empower private broadcasters by publicly funding cable television, which delayed the investment in fiber broadband by repurposing cable for broadband as a stop-gap solution. Basically a long-running chancellor in the 1990s wanted to push media that presented him more favorably and that's why thirty years later our Internet is slow. reply adwn 15 hours agorootparentprev> Yet the US space program existed solely and exclusively due to a large and heavily centralized governmental effort. That's not quite the right conclusion to draw from this. The US could afford to put a humongous amount of resources into its space program because of the productive output unleashed by capitalism and a market-based economy. For example, the US spent a lot of money on a brute-force approach to fixing the combustion instability problems in the huge F-1 engines through trial-and-error; the USSR could not afford to do this, and was forced to go with a much larger number of smaller engines (which due to budgetary constraints couldn't be tested together before the actual launch, with catastrophic consequences). reply 109 more comments...

That said, I've been trying to figure out why you would need a different notation for Chess960 for half an hour now, and I just can't figure it out. All explanations I'm seeing just make some vague mention about ambiguity in the regular notation for Chess960, but I, personally, can't think of a situation in which the regular notation is insufficient. The KQkq still unambiguously mark which player can castle to which side, and once either a rook or King move for the first time, you just remove the corresponding letter(s). What am I missing? reply Sesse__ 2 hours agorootparentOne of the rooks might move over to the other side during the course of the game, and then it's no longer unambiguous which one is the castling rook. E.g., if you have your king on e1, a rook on f1 and another one on g1… can you castle if the f1 rook moves? Can you castle if the g1 rook moves? Just “kingside” won't tell you the difference. reply cyborgx7 39 minutes agorootparentAh, that's the possibility I wasn't thinking of. Thank you. reply HL33tibCe7 2 hours agorootparentprevI mean technically it still isn’t ambiguous because you could just refer to the starting position to see which rook is allowed to move. Which of course is annoying to implement, but you do already have to keep state on the history of the game to determine if moves are legal, e.g. you can’t castle twice. reply Sesse__ 2 hours agorootparentThe entire point of a FEN is that it describes the entire board state without having to know anything about the history. > Which of course is annoying to implement, but you do already have to keep state on the history of the game to determine if moves are legal, e.g. you can’t castle twice. No, that's what the castling rights field in the FEN is for. Once you castle, you zero out both the k and q bits. reply nebulous1 35 minutes agorootparentprevYou don't have the starting position reply anamexis 11 hours agorootparentprevThat depends - Chess960 doesn't have different castling rules from normal chess, it just has additional considerations that normal chess does not. In other words, Chess960's castling rules are completely consistent with normal chess castling rules, so depending on how it is implemented, it might just work. reply vikingerik 8 hours agorootparentIt depends on how exactly you define it. If the standard rule is as commonly taught \"king moves two spaces and the rook hops over\", 960 isn't the same. If the rule is \"king moves to c or g file, rook moves to d or f\", then it is the same. Those rules are equivalent for standard chess but only the latter ports to 960 properly. (We're probably agreeing, in that's what you mean by depending on the implementation, I'm just spelling it out.) reply anamexis 8 hours agorootparentIndeed - perhaps you could say that 960's castling rules are a superset of normal castling rules. Edit: Actually, I think the other way around is more accurate - 960's castling rules are a subset of normal castling rules. reply onehair 2 hours agoprev> Plain, brutalist, no bloat chess.

Move history has to be encoded so draw by threefold / fivefold repetition and fifty moves / seventy five moves can be claimed / detected. reply Sesse__ 1 hour agorootparentThe half-move counter in the FEN takes care of the 50/75 move rule. You do need the history if you want to implement the threefold/fivefold repetition rule, but it's rare that it is actually relevant for e.g. a chess engine's strength. reply vikingerik 8 hours agorootparentprevThe move order matters, for detecting threefold or fivefold repetition, or the 50 move draw limit. To adhere to that properly, you need to somehow represent all previous positions that could be reached again, and the number of times it has occurred. Of course you can get that by including all the move history, but it's also possible to prune it a lot, like any capture or pawn move can flush the history since no previous position is reachable. But it's still a bit more complicated than just representing the current position. FEN doesn't account for this, deliberately leaving the history out of scope. It's a matter of preference whether you'd want a tool like this to handle those cases. reply staticfish 12 hours agorootparentprevurl length limitations may thwart that, unless it's all compressed which might defeat the purpose reply eertami 12 hours agorootparentChrome can supposedly support 32779 characters in the address bar[0], and a legal chess game should not exceed more than ~5900 moves, due to the 50 move rule.

UPDATE May 13, 2024 Apple and Google deliver support for unwanted tracking alerts in iOS and Android Apple and Google have worked together to create an industry specification — Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers — for Bluetooth tracking devices that makes it possible to alert users across both iOS and Android if such a device is unknowingly being used to track them. This will help mitigate the misuse of devices designed to help keep track of belongings. Today Apple is implementing this capability in iOS 17.5, and Google is now launching this capability on Android 6.0+ devices. With this new capability, users will now get an “[Item] Found Moving With You” alert on their device if an unknown Bluetooth tracking device is seen moving with them over time, regardless of the platform the device is paired with. If a user gets such an alert on their iOS device, it means that someone else’s AirTag, Find My accessory, or other industry specification-compatible Bluetooth tracker is moving with them. It’s possible the tracker is attached to an item the user is borrowing, but if not, iPhone can view the tracker’s identifier, have the tracker play a sound to help locate it, and access instructions to disable it. Bluetooth tag manufacturers including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have committed that future tags will be compatible. AirTag and third-party Find My network accessories were designed from the beginning with industry-first privacy and safety protections, and Apple has remained committed to innovating and supplementing these protections to keep consumers safe. This cross-platform collaboration — also an industry first, involving community and industry input — offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products. Apple and Google will continue to work with the Internet Engineering Task Force via the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group to develop the official standard for this technology.

I guess they probably have metrics on what Android versions are still in active use, but I'm a little surprised that Android 6.0 would still be used heavily enough to warrant the backport. Regardless, it's good to see this sort of industry cooperation from companies who would normally be at each other's throats. reply seanalltogether 14 hours agoparentGoogle made a deliberate decision long ago to detach library and feature support from the operating system due to manufacturer fragmentation. So most of their new stuff automatically works with old versions of android reply Rinzler89 12 hours agorootparentSame for security updates. A lot of new features and security patches get updated via the Google Play Services to older versions of Android as well. reply SubzeroCarnage 8 hours agorootparentGoogle Play System updates provide very few security patches and this only applies to devices with Android 10 and higher and most APEX modules are only updatable in later versions. I track security patch counts of monthly Android Security Bulletin vs available APEX vs my aftermarket backports for A7 through A13 here: https://divestos.org/pages/patch_counts#aggregatePatchCounts reply danieldk 4 hours agorootparentAnd the annoying thing is that on some phones (like Samsung phones recently, twice), the Play System updates get blocked for months on end. Worse, people who buy a new device are often stuck on ancient versions. I recently tried an Android phone again for a few months, and the update/security situation is still a mess. E.g. Samsung does monthly updates on more premium phones. But a former flagship like the S22 would sometimes only get the update near the end of the month, even before the S24 is out. Having a phone with known CVEs for the better part of a month is… meh. For some vendors, like Samsung, things are much better than a decade ago, but it’s still a far cry from Apple rolling out updates to all models simultaneously. reply Rinzler89 3 hours agorootparent>Having a phone with known CVEs for the better part of a month is… meh. Out of curiosity , have you ever encountered any malware that exploits said CVEs? If a month delay would be so dangerous, Android users, even of new devices would be getting pwned left and right, let alone Android users of device no longer getting patches. Source: Android user of old phone who hasn't been hacked yet so I'm not sure where exactly the dangers are, as the attack surface is mostly the web browser and the apps, both of which are scanned and covered by up-to-date patches from Google Play Store/Services even on my ageing phone. So as long as you don't browse extremely dodgy websites, and don't download shady apps you should be good as nothing else can't get to the Kernel CVEs on your unpatched phone. Yeah, I'm sure some crafty malware dev can whip out a targeted virus that can exploit the chain of open CVEs on my particular phone through a MMS message or something, but I'm not sure targeting the 100 or so users left still using this old OnePlus model that's worth less than 20 Euros used (pointing to a user without much income), is a good use of their skills and time, when they could be frying much bigger fish with that know-how like going after Microsoft's Azure or something. Nor am I being targeted by state actors who have these means. And if you are being targeted by state actors, they have access Zero-Days that even Apple or Google haven't patched yet so you're not safe anyway no matter what phone you have. reply curt15 9 hours agorootparentprevDoes this mean system-wide libraries can be shipped via APKs? reply gpm 7 hours agorootparentYes, that's what google play services is. reply wolpoli 47 minutes agorootparentIs this the reason that my old mid/low end android devices become unusable even through they no longer get updates? reply danieldk 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd/or Google Play System updates, which are a separate thing and usually needs to be triggered by hand to get it timely. reply tantalor 14 hours agoparentprevSupporting Android 6 would be like supporting iOS 9. Apple is only supporting latest version of iOS (17.5). reply runjake 14 hours agorootparent> Supporting Android 6 would be like supporting iOS 9. 1. Your point still stands, but this is because this update is probably shipping as a Google Play Framework update, which works on >= 6.0. Google is not (to my knowledge) releasing a new firmware. Apple would do well to decouple certain software components from iOS, IMHO. 2. In case others are curious about iOS version market share, statcounter's stats for April 2024: 17.4 (current until today): 51% 17.3: 22% 16.6: 4.3% 16.7: 3.18% 16.1: 2.8% 16.3: 2.12% https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/ios/mobil... reply tadfisher 12 hours agorootparentAs a developer, that long tail of folks on the previous major version really sucks with fast-moving frameworks like SwiftUI. There's no way my company (a banking app) would drop 10% of customers, so we typically do N-1 for iOS support. Our Android app shipped almost 3 years ago with minSdk=24 (Android 6.0) and we haven't had to update it. reply afavour 11 hours agorootparentThe web browser is a big issue with this, too. A Safari release broke IndexedDB and they didn’t release a fix for over two months because browser updates are tied to the OS. reply bzzzt 4 hours agorootparentIf there's a critical security update they can release an update within days. So it's got nothing to do with the complexity of releasing a new OS, it's just that they found IndexedDB not important enough to warrant an out of cycle update. reply ilinx 8 hours agorootparentprevI write apps for a large regional grocery store chain, and we have to support N-2. Even then we get support emails every time we bump it up. reply flutas 8 hours agorootparentI work on Android apps for a food company turned media network. We, to this day...with no talks of changing it any time soon, support all the way back to Android 5.0 (released in November on 2014). reply Const-me 4 hours agorootparentI mostly work on Windows apps. People still complain when software drops support of Windows 7 released in 2009, or Windows 8 released in 2012. Despite none of them are supported by Microsoft. reply mschuster91 3 hours agorootparentIt'd be a more fair comparison to take into account Windows 7's EOL which was just a year ago IIRC if you coughed up Extended Support money, its broad install base, and it being the last actually truly decent Windows that had a consistent UI across the place and no ads. reply tjoff 13 hours agorootparentprevAndroid 6: 0.79% reply hedgehog 13 hours agorootparentprevGoogle and Apple have fairly different platform software update strategies so I was curious how the support windows line up. Android 6 was the last supported release on devices like the Nexus 5 and Xperia Z3 from 2013 and 2014. iOS 9 was the last version supported for devices like the iPhone 4s and 3rd gen iPad that shipped in 2011 or 2012. Going forward to 2013 iPhones you have the 5s which was last supported in iOS 12. It sounds like Google is able to ship this directly rather than as an OS update that would need to go through manufacturers, while Apple typically deploys these type of fixes by pushing an OS update. I'm curious how far back they'll go, they rarely ship security fixes more than two major versions behind the current release (so maybe down to iOS 15, supporting devices released in 2015). reply GeekyBear 11 hours agorootparent> they rarely ship security fixes more than two major versions Every flagship iPhone since 2011 has gotten at least five years of OS updates, with additional years of security updates after that. For instance, the original version of the iPhone SE is currently in its eighth year of support, and just got another security update a couple of weeks ago. reply JohnTHaller 8 hours agorootparentOne issue with iOS vs Android is that iOS has the browser tied to the OS ala Internet Explorer. Once iOS is no longer supported, you're now using an unsupported insecure browser. And all other iOS browsers sit atop the unsupported insecure browser in iOS. On Android, the browser is separate and you can install alternative browsers. The current release of Chrome for Android works with Android 8 which was released in August 21, 2017 and dropped January 2021. Android System Webview (the browser engine that other apps can use so they don't have to ship their own) works the same way and is independently updated from the OS. reply GeekyBear 6 hours agorootparentUpdating an app doesn't fix an issue that requires a security update, or a replacement driver. > Virtually any Android, Linux, or Windows device that hasn't been recently patched and has Bluetooth turned on can be compromised by an attacking device within 32 feet. It doesn't require device users to click on any links, connect to a rogue Bluetooth device, or take any other action, short of leaving Bluetooth on. The exploit process is generally very fast, requiring no more than 10 seconds to complete https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/bluet... A browser update doesn't fix that and that and Blueborne was disclosed during the era when an Android device only had a support window of two of three years. iPhones from over a decade ago were getting security updates, including for the browser, for seven or eight years. reply toast0 6 hours agorootparentprev> the browser tied to the OS ala Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer was usually only loosely tied to the OS. Yes, many versions of Windows came with some version of IE, but you could usually install a newer version if you wanted. Every once in a while, a newer version of IE required a newer version of Windows, but that wasn't typical. As I understand it, on Apple systems, Safari comes with the OS and is updated together --- Safari updates come in OS updates. Mobile IE was very similar though, at least on Windows Phone 7 and newer. reply hedgehog 10 hours agorootparentprevTwo different things, Apple provides a pretty long window of OS updates for each device but doesn't ship updates for older OS versions. For example the 1st gen SE shipped with iOS 9 which has not been getting updates for a few years, but it can run iOS 15 which still seems to be getting security updates. reply GeekyBear 10 hours agorootparentIt probably seems odd when you're coming from a history of devices with a very short support window, but you don't need to worry about years when you only get a security update until you run out of years when you get the OS AND security updates first. For instance, that original iPhone SE came out in 2016, the same year as the original Pixel phone. The iPhone is still supported by Apple today, while the Pixel phone was dropped from support by Google five years ago. Google had to come up with a way to backport features to older unsupported versions of the OS because their support window was so abysmally short. Hopefully, this won't be an issue going forward, with Google promising a comparable support window in the future. reply scarface_74 13 hours agorootparentprevYou’re right iOS 15 got an update earlier this year. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_15 reply scarface_74 13 hours agorootparentpreviOS 17.5 supports devices back to the iPhone XS released in 2018. iOS 17 runs on 80% of current iPhones in use https://telemetrydeck.com/blog/ios-market-share-03-24/#:~:te.... reply lawgimenez 9 hours agoparentprevHere in Asia, people are still on the older Android versions.

I'm not surprised Google only goes back to Android 6, they were always dropping versions from support before WA did; their threshold must be higher. reply beAbU 1 hour agorootparentWhatsApp majority userbase sits outside of the US, and it's deeply embedded in many 3rd world countries. I'm not sure how their European userbase compares with the African/Asian userbase. I reckon the WhatsApp userbase OS distribution skews much more to older android versions compared to an app that mostly enjoys US/1st world country userbase. reply flutas 8 hours agorootparentprevYep, my company would lose a significant amount of our users if we updated from Android 5.0. A lot of the early Fire TV devices are still out there running Android 5.0, and they are actively used. reply josefx 4 hours agoparentprevI just recently pulled out an old phone that originally ran Android 6 for a project, hardware wise it still runs perfectly.

I've had two reasons to need to \"find\" things with AirTags where I specifically didn't know where they were: - airline bungle, so luggage was left at a transit airport. - forgetting where something had been put down. But the most common usage is the opposite, positive confirmation: we've just left for the airport, check if everything says \"with you\" once you're a few hundred meters down the road. If the most likely reason for something to be \"lost\" is that it was stolen, maybe you should move somewhere with a less than apocalyptic level of petty crime. reply amelius 31 minutes agorootparentI was told airtags stop working when the tag moves along with an iphone (for privacy reasons). This would happen on an airline. reply renewiltord 4 hours agorootparentprevNot for me. It’s cure for forgetfulness. reply oblio 1 hour agorootparentprevThey weren't marketed but it was implied.

Edit: here is an article around the time of release describing how they work: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-a... > To discourage what it calls “unwanted tracking,” Apple built technology into AirTags to warn potential victims, including audible alarms and messages about suspicious AirTags that pop up on iPhones.

So it is now on me to know whether my object is lost or stolen? Even if I magically knew all the details, that isn't a bright line rule. One person's \"lost\" luggage is another's stolen electronics.

Like, it wouldn't even be that hard. Place a long, wide recess maybe 2mm deep along the entire trolley, where the tag can be stuck in and is guarded that way against conveyor belts or other bags ripping off the tag. And maybe invent a system where you have to scan your boarding pass and the tag barcode to leave the baggage claim area to reduce the amount of cases where people have taken the wrong bag. reply kstrauser 14 hours agoparentprevYep. That ruins half the value of AirTags. It's a limitation that their competitors, like Tile, didn't have until very recently. Every time this comes up, someone butts in with \"they're for lost items, not stolen ones!\", which is technically accurate but pedantic beyond reason. \"Stolen\" is a special case of \"lost\" for most people. In both cases the object is out of the owner's possession. \"Stolen\" just means it's deliberately missing and not accidentally so. I understand, sympathize, and support the idea of making life harder for would-be stalkers. My gut instinct says non-notifying AirTags would make life harder for many more thieves than the self-tattling AirTags does stalkers. Apple and Google agree with each other that inconveniencing those losers outweighs abetting thieves. That's their decision to make. I'd still be irritated if I couldn't find my lost-with-the-help-of-a-thief bike because my AirTag told the thief I was looking for it. reply smeej 14 hours agorootparentI think the idea is that thieves that have already been successful at removing the item from your possession are much less of a threat to your life than someone who is actively tracking where you are. It's a debate worth having, which one should be the priority, but I can appreciate the logic of doing it this way. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentI can, too. I can also think of counterexamples: if a person is broke, they use their bike to get to work, and someone steels it, that's going to give them a very, very bad week. There's some hard calculus there I'm glad I'm not in charge of. Blocking 1 stalker is clearly more important than blocking one sunglasses thief. I suspect that blocking 1,000 bike thieves would have a bigger societal benefit than blocking 1 stalker. These are hard questions. I can appreciate the challenges. And yet I'd still be highly peeved if I could my AirTag laying on the ground because it alerted a thief who then removed and discarded it. reply zeroimpl 10 hours agorootparentEven if the tracker didn’t alert the thief, how hard is it for a thief to find a tracker on the bike on their own? I don’t think an AirTag is going to save too many bicycles. Seems like the calculus would only make sense when you are talking about big expensive items - cars, boats, RVs. But for those you probably want a non-bluetooth solution. reply matsemann 2 hours agorootparentThe bikes getting stolen here are people's \"cars\". Electric cargo bikes with room for two children is what people use to get around. Getting that stolen ruins daily logistics for people. They cost up to $10k, which is a significant amount of money. People should really rethink the societal cost of bike thieving, they are both more expensive and more integral in how people move around. Not just children's toys. I only want AirTags or similar to guard against thieves. So if that is not going to work it's quite useless for me. Luckily for bikes, there is https://bikefinder.com/ reply barkbyte 12 hours agorootparentprevStalking is way more common than successfully recovering items with a tracker like this. It’s usually a bad idea to even try. I followed a tracker into someone’s yard only to discover that the thief had thrown the tracker over the fence and I was just trespassing. reply vlovich123 12 hours agorootparentprevI think we can agree that victims of domestic abuse and stalking have a risk of physical harm and that physical harm trumps property rights / being peeved right? This is a 0-sum choice & erring on the side of not letting this product be used for stalking seems like a sane choice. There are stalking products you can go buy that are more expensive that can give you the theft protection you want. Apple's and Google's monitoring network is unfathomably large and can passively monitor any device anywhere in the world. The threat vectors they have to balance against abuse is completely different. reply kstrauser 12 hours agorootparentYou say that right after I give an example of where property crimes can seriously mess up someone’s life. Yes, 1 person’s personal safety is more important than 1 person losing a convenience item. If it were a choice between 1 person’s safety and 1,000,000 persons’ transportation, I’d pick the latter every time. The choice Apple faced clearly isn’t 1 stalking victim against 1,000,000 people unable to get to work. I use that example to show that it’s not as simple as “safety vs annoyance”. Apple and Google ran the numbers and erred on the side of safety. That doesn’t make it an automatic or simple choice. reply vlovich123 10 hours agorootparentThink about it this way - without AirTags and with AirTags + anti-stalking, your bike theft scenario is unchanged. Without airtags and with AirTags without anti-stalking, your personal safety scenario is worse. Those are the discussions I remember when I worked on CoreLocation at Apple. It had nothing to do with running the numbers, at least pre-development. I would be slightly surprised if someone tried to put numbers to that - Apple is pretty values-based when it comes to those kinds of decisions. The stalking issues go well beyond personal safety. Police officers, judges, politicians and cops who now have to worry about someone chucking a $25 airtag in their car which is much easier to do innocuously and those people have power to craft regulations and laws. Abortion rights are even more contentious now & stalking comes up there. There just isn't a scenario where opting in the entire world-wide smartphone community into enabling mass stalking at a never before price point is a net positive - there just aren't enough poor people with stolen bikes to shift that equation. There's a reason AirTags destroyed Tile - Tile's network is laughably small & would always be that way compared with the reach you get at the OS level. That drastically shifts the threat model. reply kstrauser 10 hours agorootparentWe'll never know. The personal safety issues are important and I'd never argue otherwise. Having cheap, effective crime deterrence seems like it could be a nice thing if you could wave a magic wand and remove the stalking angle. Apple keeps adding features to those ends, like the new Stolen Device Protection updates, that shift the risk-reward math for device thieves. I could still buy a cheap used phone and stick a SIM in it, hide it in a victim's car, and use that to track them without alerting them to it. And still, we get nice tools like Find My because more people are likely to lose their phone or have it stolen than to stalk their exes with it. I understand the personal safety issues. They're important. I get it. That doesn't stop part of me from wishing I could use these cheap, convenient lost item devices to help me track down stuff that wasn't exactly accidentally lost. reply vlovich123 8 hours agorootparentBuying an old phone or watch and using FindMy is a compelling counter argument. The problem is that the cost of that is meaningfully higher - it’s a $25 one time purchase vs ~$50-100 + a recurring ~$30/month. The size of the device is another one - the phone or watch is substantially bigger than an AirTag (or how small an AirTag could become over time). Finally, a phone or watch has a much shorter battery life to support tracking. You could trade off accuracy for a much longer battery life, but you’re still capped to maybe a couple of days or even a week if you really know what you’re doing. That’s compared with ~1 year of unattended AirTag use. As for crime prevention, I think you’re overestimating how much of a benefit that would have. Stolen device protections remove the value from the stolen device. That’s not the case for your stolen bike - thieves don’t actually care if you can track the device because a) knowing where your stolen property is doesn’t actually aide in it getting recovered b) as long as they can move the stolen product along quickly enough the information becomes too stale to action on it (remember - police usually need a search warrant). My cousin’s car got stolen with AirTags in it but he got lucky in that the police did something about it - plenty of news stories of AirTags in cars with people trying to get the police to do something and the police not being able to for a variety of reasons. And that’s cars which are orders of magnitude more expensive than bikes that police won’t bother with. Look up VanMoof theft stories to convince yourself that tracking is useless: https://www.reddit.com/r/vanmoofbicycle/comments/zbexyr/upda... reply diebeforei485 4 hours agorootparentSmart watches are not meaningfully larger than airtags if you take the wristband off, and a cheap prepaid plan for $5 or $10 would be more than sufficient. You also don't need FindMy because the cell network itself can triangulate. There are also dedicated devices, such as this one - https://www.t-mobile.com/devices/iot/syncup-gps-tracker-devi... - and lots of companies in China make similar products. There is a genuine need for anti-theft technology. Apple doesn't have to address that market, likely because they're afraid of brand damage, but stalkers already have plenty of options available. reply servus45678981 4 hours agorootparentprevThat isn‘t enough reason to make these things useless. A knife can be used to kill someone and to cut meat. And we still haven’t removed the sharp edge, have we? reply kjkjadksj 11 hours agorootparentprevThere is a big liability issue for these companies if they say its for tracking stolen items. Anecdotally according to reddit threads, police don't care if you have the tracker showing its at the thiefs house, thats not enough evidence to do anything and its not an active crime with people in danger worth being prompt about. law enforcement also don't want you to confront the thief due to the risk of that situation escalating. If these companies start advertising for stolen items they are effectively encouraging vigilanteism and you can imagine how much of a legal headache that will be as soon as the first airtag user is shot dead. reply dhosek 9 hours agorootparentIt’s not the police can’t do it, it’s that they don‘t want to do it. reply kjkjadksj 8 hours agorootparentAirtag pinging a location that may not even be accurate is not a reasonable cause for search nor even enough information to know where to search in some cases.

All you have is a 2d map and 35ft resolution on a good day. reply caf 4 hours agorootparentIt's not enough for a search but it's enough to knock on the door and ask. reply mft_ 13 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what I'm missing here, as Airtags have long worked like this - that as long as you had an iPhone or an Android phone with the anti-tracking app installed, you'd be notified of being stalked. So if your bike thief had an iPhone, they'd be able to find the tag anyway? AFAIK the only major difference is that it's now being baked into the Android OS so people don't need to actively download the app. reply pompino 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, I think the PR backlash for such features is too great that it spoils them for the rest of us.

You either have an absolutist/ideological view on this, or you're willing to compromise. Ultimately its a matter of perception, and then too, some people are easier to convince than others. reply vlovich123 10 hours agorootparentI really don't understand your argument here. No one is banning you from building stalking devices. Apple and Google have chosen by themselves not to do that & are working to standardize their particular implementation (which you can also see in this thread there's a lot of support for). That's very different from banning knives and gardening shears. And I think you are taking a very US-centric view. For example, switchblades & similar quick-open knives aren't legal in many jurisdictions. So yes, many countries recognize that tools have a trade-off and are willing to legislate their usage depending on problems being observed. It's very rare to find a true absolutist on any idealogy unless they're completely blinded - it's just that they draw the line further away than someone else / need a stronger argument to convince them. For example, I'm going to guess that you're not in favor of laissez faire with respect to nuclear weapons & tech - cause that shit is actually really easy and cheap to build these days & the sole difficulty is the regulations that surround it. reply pompino 6 hours agorootparent>I really don't understand your argument here.

And who's affected in each case? The anti-stalking bias degrades the product for people who've bought an AirTag and become victims of theft. It's a limited population. People are unaffected by default. The anti-theft bias means everybody is a potential victim of stalking. If I have no interest in AirTags, anybody else can still tape one to the bottom of my car and track me wherever I go. Everybody is potentially affected. Even if theft is far more common than stalking, an anti-theft bias would be a tough position for Apple to defend if it means they're potentially facilitating stalking for the entire population. It may not be ideal, but I can understand it. reply IncreasePosts 12 hours agorootparentYou also have the situation where if air tags did not have the anti-stalking features, there would be far more stalkers in the world. I'm sure there's many people who would not buy a GPS logger and connected to someone's car, but they might \"forget\" an airtag in someone's car, were it not for the anti-stalking alerts. I suspect if Apple went the Anti-Theft route, thieves would not stop thieving, they would just start searching large stolen items for air tags before bringing it to wherever they may. reply criddell 13 hours agorootparentprevApple doesn't want stalkers and they definitely don't want any part of leading people into confrontations with thieves. AirTag isn't the right product for you. Buy a tracker from somebody else. reply trallnag 11 hours agorootparentThis so much. Confronting thieves is always a bad idea. I prefer to view it in a positive light. The thief probably needed the stolen item more than I did. The thief is happy, I am happy for the thief. The overall happiness in the world has increased! reply ryukoposting 8 hours agoparentprevCan you please describe what scenario you imagine an airtag would be useful in tracking down a stolen item in an airport? I ask because I'm at a loss. BLE from these little devices has ~40ft of range on a good day, and even if a mesh network were involved, I fail to see what the airtag could do that would help you recover your item. Sound an alarm? Great, the thief knows where it is now, and they can just yank it out and throw it in the trash. Give you GPS coordinates? Great, that'll really help after you find security, tell them what happened, convince them it's urgent, and explain to them what they're looking at when you show them the app. Of course that all assumes the airtag (or a nearby mesh device) has a useful GPS fix, and the thief hasn't already found the tag and thrown it in a trash can or something. reply radicality 4 hours agorootparentImagine you put an AirTag somewhere deep into your suitcase, and someone malicious steals it and then drives off with it. With the current model, the thief will get notified there’s an AirTag traveling with them, and they can play a sound, find it and remove it / disable it. Imo without these features it would be rather unlikely for a thief to find AirTags quickly or even realize it’s there. The ~40ft range is more than enough, the global mesh network of all iPhones is the whole point of the AirTags, there’s no “gps fix”. reply BHSPitMonkey 3 hours agorootparentprevGoogle Maps generally shows my location inside of airport terminals pretty accurately, so it stands to reason that the network of iPhones in a terminal could plot a tracker's position pretty well. If someone has your bag and you know which direction they're moving, you could possibly catch up and get close enough to either spot it or (assuming you have an iPhone 11+) get a Ultra Wide Band fix to finish pinpointing it. Bury the tracker somewhere too inconvenient to locate and remove quickly, and they'll count on not removing it until later (or they'll just ditch it once it starts beeping). reply AndrewDucker 13 hours agoprevAnnoyingly, though, you can't get a device that is trackable on both iPhone and Android networks. Which is annoying, because I have an Android and my wife has an iPhone, and it would be nice to be able to both track the same objects. reply gnicholas 13 hours agoparentAren't there third-party devices like Tile that you could use?

When Google announced recently they'd open up their Find My Device network to bluetooth trackers, I assumed for sure Tile would be on board. I was dismayed to discover Tile specifically has no plans to join the Android Find My Device network, unlike Chipolo and Pebblebee. So I switched to Pebblebee. The Life360 network may be sizable but it's going to me nowhere close to the iOS or Android networks, and it's going to get a lot smaller with folks like me leaving.

There's a clear disclaimer of who they are, and they're responding to a specific criticism. Their comment at the top level also has that disclaimer and while it's written in a bit of a marketing tone, it adds substantive value to the discussion. One major value of HN is that we get people who are actively involved in building various pieces of technology directly engaging with the community. When there's a strong disclosure of who they are, that's almost always a good thing. (Of course, some organisations don't encourage that disclosure and that's a little more ambiguous). reply RobertRies 7 hours agorootparentprevI think it's pretty fair to make this clarification and I don't fault a company for wanting to squash misinformation about their product. I found it to be a useful comment because I had no sense of the scale of the Tile network, and I did have an intuition that it was much smaller. I have zero affiliation with Tile and I have never bought any device like this of any sort, but this is useful information to me as someone who has been the target of frequent bicycle theft. The criticism I will agree with is that it does feel worded a with a bit of a corporate polished tone that does give that vibe. edit: I think it's largely the \"supercharge\" descriptor. reply gnicholas 7 hours agorootparentprevLike @RobertRies, I found this comment useful. I've never bought a Tile but now that I know they have this much penetration I'm somewhat more likely to. I also had not seen the other posts by GP, so don't find it redundant. reply yreg 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can always glue two Chipolos together. Interesting that they don't offer such product yet though. reply hanniabu 12 hours agorootparentprevHow does the tracking network size affect functionality? reply daemonologist 11 hours agorootparentThese trackers work by connecting to nearby phones, with the phone supplying GPS information and uploading it via its cell connection. So a Tile tracker will only get its location updated if someone with the Tile app is nearby, and since Tile users are relatively rare the tracking is only reliable in very busy places. Apple and now Google trackers on the other hand build this functionality into the OS (or Google's near-OS bundle for Android), so if basically any phone comes within range of the tracker it will provide a location update. reply Jtsummers 12 hours agorootparentprev> How does the tracking network size affect functionality? Ability to actually find lost items. AirTags are so successful (in the US) because of the ubiquity of iPhones which are, effectively, constantly reporting on the location of detected devices. A smaller network of listening/reporting devices will not be as effective unless it happens to be very popular right in the area the device was lost. reply ihuman 11 hours agorootparentprevThe devices don't have any GPS. Instead, they have a unique ID that phones see, and report their location to Apple/Google/Tile. If the network is bigger/denser, then your devices is more likely to be detected, and detected more often. reply mplewis 11 hours agorootparentprevIf there are more devices that can see your stolen device, there is a higher likelihood you will be able to track your stolen device. reply kjkjadksj 11 hours agoparentprevA true hacker would duct tape the airtag to the android phone and call it a day. reply xarope 3 hours agoprevSo if people are sticking these on valuable items, is the use case now for thieves to break into a house, wander around and be alerted when said valuable items (which are hidden or otherwise not obviously evident) are close by? reply antoniojtorres 2 hours agoparentI would hope the threshold that has to be crossed for the alert functionality to trigger is more than a few minutes of proximity. Both items would have to move to together to weed out false positives, otherwise you’d set everything off at an airport terminal… reply theshrike79 2 hours agoparentprevThey would need to stay in the house quite a while to get the alert.

In an ideal world Android users can detect unwanted Airtags because the protocol is documented and open. In the world we live in, Google has to go out of their way to solve problems Apple is inventing for them. The only possible interpretation of this is that Apple knows their current system wouldn't survive antitrust inquiries. So they're making a pathetically marginal concession (\"well we did let you track the hostile users!\") to cement the rationale of a pointlessly insular system. Once again, Apple is refusing to fully solve a fixable problem in order to artificially create a market in which to sell their solution. reply winterdeaf 10 hours agoprevThis is such a charade. Making \"invisible\" airtags is trivial [1], and I wouldn't be surprised if such airtags are being manufactured en-masse. We allowed the creation of a global tracking network under the false pretense of privacy.

And my iPhone popped up an alert that there was an airtag following me. (It wasn't of course it was an airtag in another attendee's bag to track their bag which they had with them, near me kind of randomly, but being driven by the same forces of movement :-)). reply kstrauser 14 hours agoparentMy understanding is you should only get the notification if the tag isn't with its owner. That's how it plays out in my personal experience. Back when AirTags were completely broken and didn't support family sharing, I'd get notified if I had my wife's car keys with me only when she wasn't with me, i.e. because I grabbed hers to run a quick errand. This notification would be utterly useless if that were no longer the case: you'd spend half your time on a flight or bus ride closing the unwanted and unhelpful popups. reply rsstack 14 hours agorootparentI use AirPods Pro but an Android phone.

I searched quite a bit and couldn't figure it out. I get these unwanted alerts every time my wife and I travel with luggage that she's placed AirTags into.

We both have Android phones, and she also has an iPad which she used to configure the AirTags but it's normally turned off. reply jtbayly 13 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like if it happens again, they can just choose to disable the AirTag completely? reply ChuckMcM 10 hours agorootparentAs others have pointed out, no, not without access to the Airtag.

Disablement The accessory SHALL have a way to be disabled such that its future locations cannot be seen by its owner. Disablement SHALL be done via some physical action (e.g., button press, gesture, removal of battery, etc.). Ledvina, et al. Expires 22 June 2024 [Page 26] Internet-Draft Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers December 2023 3.13.1. Disablement instructions The accessory manufacturer SHALL provide both a text description of how to disable the accessory as well as a visual depiction (e.g. image, diagram, animation, etc.) that MUST be available when the platform is online and OPTIONALLY when offline. Disablement procedure or instructions CAN change with accessory firmware updates. These are provided as part of the onboarding process (Section 7). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-lo... Yes. Physical access would likely be needed for most of these devices and would be sufficient for satisfying the RFC, based on the examples in section 3.13. So you might get a notification of a device \"following\" you because I have a tracker in my bag but no phone (or my phone is off, perhaps; or maybe it's just malfunctioning and mis-reporting as happens sometimes). You play the sound and find out it's in the bag underneath your seat on the bus, but that's my bag. You could attempt to rifle through it and take my tracker and disable it, but I'd probably stop you. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentprevIt does.

That's the real price you must pay to successfully use the \"free tier.\" Anyways.. PostgreSQL is an open source project. Amazon RDS is a managed service that can run instances of it. Amazon Aurora is a different service that provides it's own engine that is _compatible_ with MySQL and PostgreSQL. To know why you'd use one or the other, the shibboleth is \"FAQ,\" so search for \"AWS Aurora FAQ\" and carefully read the whole page before you enable the service. reply simonw 12 hours agorootparent\"It's not too hard to figure out, though, if you take the time to read through their rather large set of documentation\" I don't even know where I would start with that. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ lists documentation for 305 different products! reply deanCommie 7 hours agorootparentWell, presumably, from the service you decided to use first? reply _adamb 12 hours agoparentprevWe have a slack channel, #aws-budget-alerts, where AWS sends a notification any time our forecasted spend reaches certain milestones or the actual spend reaches certain milestones.

You can get billing alerts if current costs are projected to go over a threshold. reply hughesjj 12 hours agorootparentYou have to manually set this up though. There's so much UX for a prospective new AWS dev that could be improved. Say a 1 click \"do you want billing alerts with that?\" Template, or a \"do you want to lock down expensive nonfree stuff?\" option to set some soft limits to zero out of the gate (nescessitating a self serve support case to unblock). It's frustrating. It's been this way for over a decade yet you'll still see new customers cutting themselves on the nuances of free tier. I get that AWS is 'enterprise real deal do what I say', but I don't think that means you should completely exclude the customer story of any new developers just getting their feet wet. It's an area of customer obsession the business has regrettably lacked, and if you go by the continuous stories of people messing it up on HN/twitter/reddit/etc, it only becomes more glaring how little the new guys are being taken care of. reply lapcat 12 hours agorootparentprevMy threshold is $0. I was never expecting to get billed on the free tier. reply OptionOfT 12 hours agorootparentprevBut it's kinda the same as a trial where you have to put in a credit card number. If they auto-charge once the trial is over, I don't like them. That is a dark pattern. Equally, with this, AWS could very well ask you, the user, what you'd like to do if you surpass the free tier. Charge? Or turn it all off. On top of that they could instate default thresholds so that you, the person who just started their free trial, does not get bill shock when you forget to turn of that $200/h machine. reply paulddraper 11 hours agorootparentAlmost all trials tell you how much they'll charge you. reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agoprevRelated: Jeff Barr acknowledges S3 unauthorized request billing issue - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40221108 - May 2024 (18 comments) How an empty S3 bucket can make your AWS bill explode - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40203126 - April 2024 (111 comments) reply jsheard 15 hours agoprevThe system works!

One day, we discovered this whole underbelly community that had apparently been thriving under our metaphorical floorboards, and promptly evicted them.

Good luck... reply wavemode 13 hours agorootparentSimple. Just encode all of your app's data and logic as a massive lookup table, each bit of which is represented by an object that either doesn't exist (a zero) or is unauthorized to access (a one). When you read a sequential series of keys (404 403 403 404 = 0110) it will either tell you the data you were looking for or the next key name to begin reading from. reply _flux 2 hours agorootparentYou can also perfectly parallellize those requests, making the operation highly efficient! reply adrianmonk 11 hours agorootparentprevIt said \"never incur request or bandwidth charges\". I assume this means you don't pay to compute the response or for the bandwidth to deliver it. Seems you could compute the response, store it somewhere (memcached or something), and then return an error. Then have the caller make another call to retrieve the response. (To associate the two requests, have the caller generate a UUID and pass it on both calls.) That doesn't make it entirely free, but it reduces the compute cost of every request to just reading from a cache. (This does sound like a good way to get banned or something else nasty, so it's definitely not a recommendation.) reply dgacmu 13 hours agorootparentprevWell, you can probably send out one bit a time by updating your ACLs on a clock (with which your clients are also roughly synchronized) and distinguishing between 403 and 404. take an awful lot of time to get that data out, though. reply ornornor 13 hours agorootparent> take an awful lot of time to get that data out, though.

Legal realizes that what they are doing is borderline fraud and sends it to the VP that oversees billing as a P0. It then gets handed down to a senior director who is responsible for fixing it within a week. Comms gets looped in to soft announce it. At no point does anyone look at log data or give a shit about any instrumentation. It is a business decision to limit liability to a lawsuit or BCP investigation. As a publicly traded company it is also extremely risky for them to book revenue that comes from fraudulent billing. reply amzn-throw 7 hours agorootparentAs someone that works at AWS (but not on S3), that's wrong in like eight different ways. But the only way that matters is the core one - analysis, data, and instrumentation. AWS does not make these kinds of decisions without a look at the metrics. reply xmprt 11 hours agorootparentprevI find this hard to believe because this issue was known for years. reply drekipus 10 hours agorootparentIt only just became viral in social media.

The fact that is the case suggests they may do the work to fulfill the request before knowing the response code and doing billing, so there might be some loophole to get them to do lots of useful work for free... reply dmw_ng 13 hours agorootparent> do lots of useful work for free Have often wondered about this in terms of some of their control plane APIs, a read-only IAM key used as part of C&C infrastructure for a botnet might be interesting, you get DNS/ClientHello signature to a legitimate and reputable service for free, while stuffing \"DDoS this blog\" e.g. in some tags of a free resource. Even better if the AWS account belonged to someone else. But certainly, ability to serve an unlimited URL space from an account with only positive hits being billed seems ripe for abuse.

The call immediately falls silent with only occasional gasps heard from stunned engineers, and the gentle weeping of a PM. I wonder if Amazon offers free therapy following an incident like this reply xmprt 14 hours agorootparentprevI was thinking this too. You're giving AWS a lot of credit if you think they're not going to do some kind of analysis about how much they were making (albeit illegitimately) from invalid responses. I'm just surprised that they either didn't do the analysis beforehand or that if they did do the analysis beforehand (like the parent commenter suspected), how they were able to get the report for that analysis out so quickly. reply moi2388 3 hours agoprevThere needs to be a law that says any user needs to set any limit on any service or subscription, and then the costs can not surpass this until the budget is upped by the user. At the same time, there should be real-time cost analysis, breakdown per service and predicted costs per day. reply usr1106 3 hours agoparentA law in which country? Well, GDPR showed a bit that rather global impact is possible. If you offer an open service on the internet you need to be prepared that users and misusers will cause costs. However, if you block it for public access you as a customer are not offering a public service. It's the cloud provider offering a public service so it seems just a basic legal principle that it's the cloud provider who pays for misuse (attempts to access something that is not public). But of course big corporations are not known for fair contracts respecting legitimate interest of the customer before legal action is on the horizon. I wonder what made AWS wake up here. reply cratermoon 14 hours agoprevFrom the previous story, \"S3 requests without a specified region default to us-east-1 and are redirected as needed.

Delegate a subdomain like cloud.yourcompany.net to R53 and use that. reply paulddraper 11 hours agoparentprevThat's not analogous. reply beeeeerp 8 hours agorootparentIt’s still a huge problem for people that have purchased domains. I bought one that apparently used to be a BT tracker, and gets on the order of several hundred NXDOMAIN requests per second. I understand it’s still hitting Route53 infrastructure, but I’m not using it, and it’s not commonplace to charge for NXDOMAIN records. Because of this, I’m unable to host at AWS (prohibitively expensive for my use-case). It’s worth mentioning that DNS infrastructure for things like this are very cheap (I used to self-host the DNS infrastructure for this domain for ~$2.5/mo), so the up charge is even worse that what AWS is charging for bandwidth. If they brought it in line with actual costs, I wouldn’t have as much of a problem. reply paulddraper 7 hours agorootparentA book could be written about AWS \"overcharged\" services reply beeeeerp 5 hours agorootparentTotally agree with this.

I am very familiar with the typical multi-model workflow and have implemented it several times. reply kwindla 15 hours agoparentprevAn audio-to-audio model is definitely a step forward. And I do think that's where things are going to go, generally speaking. For context relating to real-time voice AI: once you're down below ~800ms things are fast enough to feel naturally responsive for most people and use cases. The GPT-4o announcement page says they average ~320ms time to first token from an audio prompt. Which is definitely next level and is really, really exciting. You can't get to 800ms with any pipeline that includes GPT-4 Turbo today, so this is a big deal. It's possible to do ~500ms time to first token by pipelining today's fastest transcription, inference, and tts models. (For example, Deepgram transcription, Groq Llama-3, Deepgram Aura voices.) reply tempusalaria 11 hours agorootparentEvery opening phrase is a platitude like ‘sure let’s do it’.

Google Assistant's voice-activated speakers were released in May 2016. From what I can tell, Siri is still a dumpster fire that nobody is willing to use. And I have no personal experience with Alexa, so I can't speak to it. But I do have a few Google Home speakers and an Android phone, and I have seen no major improvements in years. In fact, it has gotten worse - for example, you can no longer add items directly to AnyList[0], only Google Keep. Or, as an incredibly simple example of something I thought we'd get a long time ago, it's still unable to interpret two-part requests, e.g. \"please repeat that but louder,\" or \"please turn off the kitchen and dining room lights.\" I find voice assistants very useful - especially when driving, lying in bed, cooking, or when I'm otherwise preoccupied. Yet they have stagnated almost since their debut. I can only imagine nobody has found a viable way to monetize them. What will it take to get a better voice assistant for consumers?

I have no personal experience with Alexa, so I can't speak to it I use both (albeit more Alexa than Siri, both just for a really limited functionality set), and FWIW, I believe Alexa is worse than Siri. It can do two things at the same time though (just as your example: \"turn on X and turn off Y\", \"turn on X for Y seconds\", and things like that). I also feel that it has gotten worse over the years. I read about the possibility of microphones getting dust and therefore capturing worse audio, so I got a dust blower (for other reasons, too), but it didn't solve anything. After listening in the app what Alexa picks up (from an Echo and Echo Dot, both 4th. Gen), I have to say that they use really shitty microphones. Furthermore, I have been testing Whisper extensively last month, with audio coming from low-quality sources, and I think a similar model would interpret a lot better my voice than whatever Amazon is using. reply magicalhippo 14 hours agoparentprev> it's still unable to interpret two-part requests Our car has Google Assistant, and yeah that's annoying.

Yes! I really think voice assistants are underrated. When I talk to iOS users, they have a much less favorable opinion of Siri (and I've watched my partner give up on using it over the past 10 years) and given that iOS has dominant market share in the US, I suspect this is a part of it. But I also think there is just so much \"low hanging fruit\" that would drastically improve the experience.

For bidirectional real-time audio, I think they'll need to make new WebSocket or WebRTC endpoints available. reply jshreder 15 hours agorootparentJust letting you know it's available right now, just specify `gpt-4o` -- for text streaming anyway. I'd hazard a guess that the audio endpoints are open now, just not documented (like most of the last launches)... reply kwindla 15 hours agorootparentYeah, seems to be a drop-in replacement for the existing inference APIs. But I haven't found any docs yet for streaming audio/video input. reply avarun 15 hours agoparentprev [–] Yeah, same question here. Building pipelines for bridging LLMs and TTS and STT models with lower latency is fine and all, but when you compare to a natively multimodal model like GPT-4o it seems strictly inferior. The future is clearly voice-native models that are able to understand nuances in voice and speech patterns, and it's not exactly a distant future. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

If you don’t want your private information transmitted, worry about the things that are verifiably and obviously transmitting your private information instead of pointlessly fretting over things that are verifiably behaving as they claim. Do you have the Instagram or Facebook apps on your phone? Are you logged in to Google? These are much bigger threats to your privacy than a mic. The sum total of all of your Telegram, Discord, and iMessage DMs (all of which are effectively provided to the service provider without end to end encryption) is way more interesting than 86400 images of you sitting in front of your computer with your face scrunched up, or WAVs of you yelling at your kids.

    "originBody": "Next-Gen Falcon 2 Series launches AI Model that is Open-Source, Multilingual, and Multimodal – and is only AI Model with Vision-to-Language Capabilities New Falcon 2 11B Outperforms Meta’s Llama 3 8B, and Performs on par with leading Google Gemma 7B Model, as Independently Verified by Hugging Face Leaderboard Immediate Plans Include Exploring 'Mixture of Experts' for Enhanced Machine Learning Capabilities Abu Dhabi-UAE: 13 May, 2024 - The Technology Innovation Institute (TII), a leading global scientific research center and the applied research pillar of Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Research Council (ATRC), today launched a second iteration of its renowned large language model (LLM) – Falcon 2. Within this series, it has unveiled two groundbreaking versions: Falcon 2 11B, a more efficient and accessible LLM trained on 5.5 trillion tokens with 11 billion parameters, and Falcon 2 11B VLM, distinguished by its vision-to-language model (VLM) capabilities, which enable seamless conversion of visual inputs into textual outputs. While both models are multilingual, notably, Falcon 2 11B VLM stands out as TII's first multimodal model – and the only one currently in the top tier market that has this image-to-text conversion capability, marking a significant advancement in AI innovation. Tested against several prominent AI models in its class among pre-trained models, Falcon 2 11B surpasses the performance of Meta’s newly launched Llama 3 with 8 billion parameters(8B), and performs on par with Google’s Gemma 7B at first place (Falcon 2 11B: 64.28 vs Gemma 7B: 64.29), as independently verified by Hugging Face, a US-based platform hosting an objective evaluation tool and global leaderboard for open LLMs. More importantly, Falcon 2 11B and 11B VLM are both open-source, empowering developers worldwide with unrestricted access. In the near future, there are plans to broaden the Falcon 2 next-generation models, introducing a range of sizes. These models will be further enhanced with advanced machine learning capabilities like 'Mixture of Experts' (MoE), aimed at pushing their performance to even more sophisticated levels. All of TII’s AI models released to date have consistently ranked in the top tier globally, as the most powerful open-source LLMs. The new scaled-down and versatile Falcon 2 11B models are set to give TII greater market adoption in the ever-evolving world of generative AI. Falcon 2 11B models, equipped with multilingual capabilities, seamlessly tackle tasks in English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and various other languages, enriching their versatility and magnifying their effectiveness across diverse scenarios. Falcon 2 11B VLM, a 2 vision-to-language model, has the capability to identify and interpret images and visuals from the environment, providing a wide range of applications across industries such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, education, and legal sectors. These applications range from document management, digital archiving, and context indexing to supporting individuals with visual impairments. Furthermore, these models can run efficiently on just one graphics processing unit (GPU), making them highly scalable, and easy to deploy and integrate into lighter infrastructures like laptops and other devices. H.E. Faisal Al Bannai, Secretary General of ATRC and Strategic Research and Advanced Technology Affairs Advisor to the UAE President, said: \"With the release of Falcon 2 11B, we've introduced the first model in the Falcon 2 series. While Falcon 2 11B has demonstrated outstanding performance, we reaffirm our commitment to the open-source movement with it, and to the Falcon Foundation. With other multimodal models soon coming to the market in various sizes, our aim is to ensure that developers and entities that value their privacy, have access to one of the best AI models to enable their AI journey.\" Speaking on the model, Dr. Hakim Hacid, Executive Director and Acting Chief Researcher of the AI Cross-Center Unit at TII, said: “AI is continually evolving, and developers are recognizing the myriad benefits of smaller, more efficient models. In addition to reducing computing power requirements and meeting sustainability criteria, these models offer enhanced flexibility, seamlessly integrating into edge AI infrastructure, the next emerging megatrend. Furthermore, the vision-to-language capabilities of Falcon 2 open new horizons for accessibility in AI, empowering users with transformative image to text interactions.” The versatility of Falcon 2 11B has also led TII to consider working on more exciting GenAI innovations. Among these, will be the adoption of a new type of machine learning capability known as the aforementioned ‘Mixture of Experts’. This method involves amalgamating smaller networks with distinct specializations, ensuring that the most knowledgeable domains collaborate to deliver highly sophisticated and customized responses – almost like having a team of smart helpers who each know something different and work together to predict or make decisions when needed. This approach not only improves accuracy, but it also accelerates decision-making, paving the way for more intelligent and efficient AI systems Falcon 2 11B is licenced under TII Falcon License 2.0, the permissive Apache 2.0-based software license which includes an acceptable use policy that promotes the responsible use of AI. More information on the new model can be found at FalconLLM.TII.ae",

Falcon-180b had a lot of hype at first but the community soon realized it was nearly worthless. Easily outperformed by smaller LLMs in the general case. Now they are back and claiming their falcon-11b LLM outperforms Llama 3 8b. I already see a number of issues with this: - falcon-11b is like 40% larger than Llama 3 8b so how can you compare them when they aren't in the same size class - their claim seems to be based on automated benchmarks when it has long been clear that automated benchmarks are not enough to make that claim - some of their automated benchmarks are wildly lower than Llama 3 8b's scores. It only beats Llama 3 8b on one benchmark and just barely. I can make an LLM does the best anyone has ever seen on one benchmark, but that doesn't mean my LLM is good. Far from it - clickbait headline with knowingly premature claims because there has been zero human evaluation testing - they claim their LLM is better than Llama 3 but completely ignore Llama 3 70b Honestly, it annoys me how much attention tiiuae get when they haven't produced anything useful and continue this misleading clickbait. reply marci 13 hours agoparentprevMaybe that's not the right metrics to compare. True, the model is bigger, but required less tokens than Llama 3 to train. The issue is when there's no open datasets, it's hard to really compare and replicate. Is it because of the model's architecture? Dataset quality? Model size? A mixture of those? Something else? reply dragonwriter 10 hours agorootparent> True, the model is bigger, but required less tokens than Llama 3 to train. That…doesn’t matter to users. User’s care what it can do, and what it requires for them to use it, not what it took for you to make it. Sure, if it has better performance relative to training set size that’s interesting from a scientific perspective and learning about how to train models, maybe, if it scales the same as other models in that regard. But ultimately, for use, until you get to a model that does better absolutely, or does better relevant to models with the same resource demands, you aren’t offering an advantage. reply marci 25 minutes agorootparentI understand, I'm just glad for the possible implications for future models: less expensive to make => less expensive to iterate. MoE are cheaper to train. My favorite right now is Wizard 8x22b, so as a random user, I don't really care about this model. Will probably never run it as-is. But makes me hope for a Falcon-MoE. Also, the fact that it's less dense than llama 3 means there may be more room for lora fine-tuning, and at a lesser cost than required for llama 3 while sacrificing way less of its smarts. That may be my use. reply hehdhdjehehegwv 15 hours agoparentprevSeems to be the case with all their models - really huge in size, no actual performance gains for the effort. Their refined web dataset is heavily censored so maybe that has something to do with it. It’s very morally conservative - total exclusion of pornography and other topics.

But a document like this which basically has a bunch of words followed by a \"Just kidding\" line, are not enforceable, because it contradicts the previous language. A judge would throw the whole thing out because it doesn't meet the standard of a contract. reply zarzavat 14 hours agorootparentWhich matters because training an LLM very likely is not protected by copyright. While for a copyrighted work the default is that you can’t use it unless you have a valid license, for an LLM the default is that you can use it unless you have signed a contract restricting what you can do in return for some consideration. I don’t think these contracts are designed to be enforced because an attempt to enforce it would reveal it to be hot air, they are just there to scare people into compliance.

From my understanding it's not really legal - or at worst it's a gray area - but the language is just too risky if you're not looking to be the test case in court. reply taneq 11 hours agorootparentExactly. It’s not about whether it’s enforceable, it’s about the fact that a sketchy license indicates that they might not always operate in good faith. reply tptacek 17 hours agorootparentprevWhy wouldn't they be? The starting presumption for a new work is that you have no permission to use it at all. reply TrueDuality 14 hours agorootparentIt unfortunately isn't worded that it only affects new usage. If you needed to check once before your initial use that would be shady but unquestionably legal as the terms of the contract are clear when you are entering into the agreement. This clause allows them to arbitrarily change the contract with you at will, with no notice. That _shouldn't_ be enforceable but AFAIK that kind of contract has never been tested. It is _likely_ unenforceable though. reply tptacek 10 hours agorootparentWhy shouldn't that be enforceable? \"Permission to use this software may be withdrawn at any time\" seems like it would be an enforceable clause; why would this be less so? reply worldsayshi 9 hours agorootparentHow about you use my service once now and in the future I might decide that the cost of that usage should be double? reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentThen you stop using the service. reply xmprt 16 hours agorootparentprevI suppose a better question would be \"how drastic can the change be to the license?\" because by adding that term, you're basically superseding every other term on the license. How do licenses deal with contradictory terms if that's even possible? reply tptacek 16 hours agorootparentThe license is explicit that it can be updated unilaterally. Nobody can adopt this software and claim not to know that's a possibility. There are attorneys specializing in open source licenses who comment on HN regularly, and maybe they'll surprise us, but, as a non-lawyer nerding out on this stuff I put all my chips down on \"this is legally fine\". reply xmprt 16 hours agorootparentThe two reasons I think it's not that black and white is: 1. This brings up the question of being able to agree to a contract before the contract is written which makes no sense. 2. If it's legal then why don't all companies do it. Instead, companies like Google regularly put out updated terms of service which you have to agree to before continuing to use their service. Often times you don't realize it because it's just another checkbox or button to click before signing in. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentThere are all sorts of contracts that can be unilaterally terminated. reply gitfan86 16 hours agorootparentprevJudges don't enforce bad contracts. Imagine if a landlord sued a tenant after 1 year for a new roof of an apartment because the contract stated that \"tenant will be responsible for all repairs\" but the tenant pointed out that the contract also said \"the house is in perfect and new condition\". Both things cannot be true, so the judge throws it out. Same thing here, you can't grant someone a license to use something and then immediately say, \"You can't use this without checking with us first\" it is contradictory. reply candiddevmike 17 hours agorootparentprevHow will they know you're using it? reply dartos 17 hours agorootparentSome models may have watermarks Though it’s easy to workaround if you know it’s there reply abhorrence 18 hours agoparentprev> So no matter what you think of their current AUP they reserve the right to update it to anything they like in the future, and you'll have to abide by the new one! I'm so curious if this would actually hold up in court. Does anyone know if there's any case law / precedence around this? reply davedx 18 hours agorootparentOf course, projects change their licences all the time, why wouldn't it be legal? There's a long history of startups who started with open source/open core gradually closing off or commercialising the licence. This isn't anything new at all. This is why it's good to read licenses before adopting the tech, especially if it's at all core to your business/project. reply tux3 18 hours agorootparentNo. Projects sometimes stop offering the previous license and start using a different one for new work. But if your project is Apache-2, you cannot take away someone's license after the fact. You can only stop giving away new Apache-2 licenses from that point on. The difference here is the license itself has mystery terms that can change at any time. That, is very much not done all the time. reply wtallis 18 hours agorootparentprevReleasing a new version with a new license is not the same as retroactively changing the license terms for copies already distributed of existing versions. reply mmoskal 18 hours agorootparentprevProjects change license for new code going forward. The old code remains available under the previous license (and sometimes new). Here, they are able to change the conditions for existing weights. reply binarymax 18 hours agoparentprevNot the first time they did some license shenanigans (happened with Falcon 1). I applaud their efforts but it seems they are still trying to figure out if/how to monetize. reply spacebanana7 16 hours agorootparentI doubt the Emiratis have much interest in monetisation. The value they’re probably looking for is in LLMs as a media asset. Just like Al Jazeera is valuable for Qataris and sports are valuable for the Saudis. These assets create goodwill domestically and with international stakeholders. Sometimes they make money, but that’s secondary. If people spend a few hours a day talking to LLMs there’s some media value there. They may also fear that Western models would be censored or licensed in a way harmful to UAE security and cultural objectives. Imagine if Llama 4’s license prevented military use without approval by some American agency. reply Havoc 18 hours agorootparentprevThey’ve got Saudi oil money behind them no?

You are just now offering an additional, more open license as well as the existing one. You haven't taken the original license away, you just provided a better default option. The same weirdly enough goes in reverse as well. You can provide a more restrictive license retroactively even if the rights holders don't consent as long as the existing license is compatible with the new, more restrictive license. i.e. you can promote a work from Apache-2.0 to GPL-3.0-or-later as the former is fully compatible with the latter. However you can't stop existing users from using it as Apache-2.0, you can only stop offering it yourself with that license (but anyone who has an existing Apache-2.0 copy or who is an original rights holder can freely distribute it). reply selimthegrim 17 hours agorootparentprevDidn’t Oracle try with OpenSolaris? reply darby_eight 18 hours agoparentprev> Great example of why I don't like the trend of calling licenses like this \"open source\" when they aren't compatible with the OSI definition.

The chat tuning that Meta did seems better than the chat tuning on Gemma. Regardless, the Gemma 1.1 chat models have been fairly good in my experience, even if I think the Llama3 8B chat model is definitely better. CodeGemma 1.1 7B is especially underrated compared to my testing of other relevant coding models. The base CodeGemma 7B base model is one of the best models I’ve tested for code completion, and the chat model is one of the best models I’ve tested for writing code. Some other models seem to game the benchmarks better, but in real world use, don’t hold up as well as CodeGemma for me. I look forward to seeing how CodeLlama3 does, but it doesn't exist yet. reply Hugsun 15 hours agorootparentThe model type is a good point. It's hard to track all the variables in this very fast paced field. Thank you for sharing your CodeGemma experience.

Was there anything official from Meta? reply coder543 13 hours agorootparentCodeGemma has fewer parameters than Llama3, so it absolutely should not be slower. That sounds like a configuration issue. Meta originally released Llama2 and CodeLlama, and CodeLlama vastly improved on Llama2 for coding tasks. Llama3-8B is okay at coding, but I think CodeGemma-1.1-7b-it is significantly better than Llama3-8B-Instruct, and possibly a little better than Llama3-70B-Instruct, so there is plenty of room for Meta to improve Llama3 in that regard. > Was there anything official from Meta? https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/ \"The text-based models we are releasing today are the first in the Llama 3 collection of models.\" Just a hint that they will be releasing more models in the same family, and CodeLlama3 seems like a given to me. reply attentive 9 hours agorootparentI suppose it could be quantization issue, but both are done by lmstudio-community.

On the same hardware, with the same q8_0 quantization on both models, I'm seeing 77 tokens/s with Llama3-8B and 72 tokens/s with CodeGemma-7B, which is a very surprising result to me, but they are still very similar in performance. reply attentive 5 hours agorootparentYou're right, ollama does perform the same on both models.

The game is still the simulation of modern air combat, complete with excellent tutorials, varied missions, and accurate flight dynamics that Falcon fans have come to know and love.

The PR stating an 11B model outperforms 7B and 8B models 'in the same class' feels like it might be stretching a bit. We'll see -- I'll definitely give this a go for local inference.

I think it's an interesting choice to put it out as tech competitive. Stats say this one was trained on 5T tokens. For reference, Llama 3 so far was reported at 15T. There is no way you get back what you lost in training by expanding parameters 3B. If I were in charge of UAE PR and this project, I'd a) buy a lot more H100s and get the training budget up b) compete on a regional / messaging / national freedom angle c) fully open license it I guess I'm saying I'd copy Zuck's plan, with oil money instead of social money and play to my base.

I get that there are multiple aspects and that there's probably not one overall \"performance\" metric across all tasks, and I get that you can probably find a comparative between two specific models relatively easily, but there absolutely needs to be a standard by which those performances are communicated.

    "originBody": "News Toggle News Menu New mRNA cancer vaccine triggers fierce immune response to fight malignant brain tumor May 1, 2024 • By Michelle Jaffee • Media Contact • Share Dr. Elias Sayour, Chong Zhao and Arnav Barpujari discuss the mRNA cancer vaccine developed at the University of Florida. Play Video In a first-ever human clinical trial of four adult patients, an mRNA cancer vaccine developed at the University of Florida quickly reprogrammed the immune system to attack glioblastoma, the most aggressive and lethal brain tumor. The results mirror those in 10 pet dog patients suffering from naturally occurring brain tumors whose owners approved of their participation, as they had no other treatment options, as well as results from preclinical mouse models. The breakthrough now will be tested in a Phase 1 pediatric clinical trial for brain cancer. Reported May 1 in the journal Cell, the discovery represents a potential new way to recruit the immune system to fight notoriously treatment-resistant cancers using an iteration of mRNA technology and lipid nanoparticles, similar to COVID-19 vaccines, but with two key differences: use of a patient’s own tumor cells to create a personalized vaccine, and a newly engineered complex delivery mechanism within the vaccine. “Instead of us injecting single particles, we’re injecting clusters of particles that are wrapping around each other like onions, like a bag full of onions,” said senior author Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a UF Health pediatric oncologist who pioneered the new vaccine, which like other immunotherapies attempts to “educate” the immune system that a tumor is foreign. “And the reason we’ve done that in the context of cancer is these clusters alert the immune system in a much more profound way than single particles would.” Sadeem Qdaisat, Dr. Hector Mendez-Gomez and Dr. Elias Sayour discuss their new study. (Photo by Nate Guidry) Among the most impressive findings was how quickly the new method, delivered intravenously, spurred a vigorous immune-system response to reject the tumor, said Sayour, principal investigator of the RNA Engineering Laboratory within UF’s Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy and a UF Health Cancer Center and McKnight Brain Institute investigator who led the multi-institution research team. “In less than 48 hours, we could see these tumors shifting from what we refer to as ‘cold’ — immune cold, very few immune cells, very silenced immune response — to ‘hot,’ very active immune response,” he said. “That was very surprising given how quick this happened, and what that told us is we were able to activate the early part of the immune system very rapidly against these cancers, and that’s critical to unlock the later effects of the immune response.” Glioblastoma is among the most devastating diagnoses, with median survival around 15 months. Current standard of care involves surgery, radiation and some combination of chemotherapy. The new publication is the culmination of promising translational results over seven years of studies, starting in preclinical mouse models and then in a clinical trial of 10 pet dogs that had spontaneously developed terminal brain cancer and had no other treatment options. That trial was conducted with owners’ consent in collaboration with the UF College of Veterinary Medicine. Dogs offer a naturally occurring model for malignant glioma because they are the only other species that develops spontaneous brain tumors with some frequency, said Sheila Carrera-Justiz, D.V.M., a veterinary neurologist at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine who is partnering with Sayour on the clinical trials. Gliomas in dogs are universally terminal, she said. After treating pet dogs that had spontaneously developed brain cancer with personalized mRNA vaccines, Sayour’s team advanced the research to a small Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial designed to ensure safety and test feasibility before expanding to a larger trial. In a cohort of four patients, genetic material called RNA was extracted from each patient’s own surgically removed tumor, and then messenger RNA, or mRNA — the blueprint of what is inside every cell, including tumor cells — was amplified and wrapped in the newly designed high-tech packaging of biocompatible lipid nanoparticles, to make tumor cells “look” like a dangerous virus when reinjected into the bloodstream and prompt an immune-system response. The vaccine was personalized to each patient with a goal of getting the most out of their unique immune system. “The demonstration that making an mRNA cancer vaccine in this fashion generates similar and strong responses across mice, pet dogs that have developed cancer spontaneously and human patients with brain cancer is a really important finding, because oftentimes we don’t know how well the preclinical studies in animals are going to translate into similar responses in patients,” said Duane Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute and the UF Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program and a co-author of the paper. “And while mRNA vaccines and therapeutics are certainly a hot topic since the COVID pandemic, this is a novel and unique way of delivering the mRNA to generate these really significant and rapid immune responses that we’re seeing across animals and humans.” Dr. Duane Mitchell, Jeet Patel and Dr. Christina von Roemeling in the Adam Michael Rosen Neuro-oncology Laboratories. (Photo by Nate Guidry) While too early in the trial to assess the clinical effects of the vaccine, the patients either lived disease-free longer than expected or survived longer than expected. The 10 pet dogs lived a median of 139 days, compared with a median survival of 30 to 60 days typical for dogs with the condition. The next step, through support from the Food and Drug Administration and the CureSearch for Children’s Cancer foundation, will be an expanded Phase I clinical trial to include up to 24 adult and pediatric patients to validate the findings. Once an optimal and safe dose is confirmed, an estimated 25 children would participate in Phase 2, said Sayour, an associate professor in the Lillian S. Wells Department of Neurosurgery and the department of pediatrics in the UF College of Medicine, part of UF Health. For the new clinical trial, Sayour’s lab will partner with a multi-institution consortium, the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, to send the immunotherapy treatment to children’s hospitals across the country. They will do this by receiving an individual patient’s tumor, manufacturing the personalized vaccine at UF and sending it back to the patient’s medical team, said Sayour, co-leader of the Immuno-Oncology and Microbiome research program at the UF Health Cancer Center. Despite the promising results, the authors said one limitation is continued uncertainty about how best to harness the immune system while minimizing the potential for adverse side effects. “I am hopeful that this could be a new paradigm for how we treat patients, a new platform technology for how we can modulate the immune system,” said Sayour, the Stop Children's Cancer/Bonnie R. Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research. “I am hopeful for how this could now synergize with other immunotherapies and perhaps unlock those immunotherapies. We showed in this paper that you actually can have synergy with other types of immunotherapies, so maybe now we can have a combination approach of immunotherapy.” Sayour and Mitchell hold patents related to the vaccine which are under option to license by iOncologi Inc., a biotech company born as a “spin out” from UF in which Mitchell holds interest.

Mimicking this structure, we developed a facile approach for substantially enhancing immunogenicity of tumor-encoding mRNA antigens in lipid particle (LP) delivery systems through formulation of multi-lamellar LP aggregates (LPA) that can simultaneously function as vaccines and as immunomodulating agents. We show that RNA-LPAs rapidly reprogram the TME in less than 24–48 h, allowing simultaneously activated T cells to exert their effector functions. This approach overcomes the first step necessary for successful cancer immunotherapy, tumor immunosuppression and systemic tolerance, allowing effector cells to compete in a hostile immunoregulatory host system to engender rapid and long-lasting immunologic responses across murine, canine, and human cancer. reply futureisbright 14 hours agoparentFull text preprint: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.12.23287108v... reply sroussey 15 hours agoprevPersonalized per-patient treatments are going to need some manufacturing breakthroughs to make them not be cost prohibitive.

The best way to get these expensive treatments to more people who need them is to establish a public healthcare model that would use the national gdp to shoulder these medical costs for these rare diseases, that probably amount to a relative rounding error in the grand scheme of things. reply endo_bunker 13 hours agorootparentIf you're talking about the US, single payer healthcare would be nowhere close to a \"rounding error\".

The companies know they can charge almost anything if it's highly effective. I wouldn't be surprised if the pricing is 100x or even 1000x the actual manufacturing cost.

How does synthesizing a one-off mRNA compare with cutting open someone's brain? reply seren 14 hours agorootparentfrom my understanding you need a sample of the tumor to design the vaccine, so it is not OR but AND reply mlyle 14 hours agorootparentYup. Cutting out as much as possible is going to continue to be part of the standard of care for the foreseeable future, too. But I don't think that synthesizing some custom mRNA per-patient is at all cost prohibitive. Formulating a lot of different batches of mRNA in lipid nanoparticles made with different mRNA might be a little complicated now, but I don't think it's an intrinsically terrible manufacturing problem. It'll be better if this kind of technique is turns out to be applicable to more cancers, because you need to reach enough doses for economies of scale and manufacturing optimization to really kick in. reply aantix 14 hours agorootparentThere's no way to determine the properties needed by imaging alone? reply mlyle 12 hours agorootparentThe immune system reacts to molecules on the surfaces of cells, not macro-level properties. And even if you can get the immune system to react to the tumor, it's better if you've removed 99% of it, so that there's less opportunity for the tumor to evolve away from the immune reaction. (Or, in the likely case that you just slow down growth of the tumor a lot: better to start out at a 99% smaller size). reply saalweachter 13 hours agorootparentprevNot a doctor (or even a biologist), but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a heavy lift to expect the immune system to break down a fruit-sized lump, or the lymphatic system to transport it away. So you may want to remove most of the mass physically, and just leave the immune system to mop up the remainder so it doesn't regrow. reply giantg2 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I would imagine they would do the minimally invasive surgey to remove as much tumor as possible and then do the immune treatment after. Maybe it would make sense to a biopsy and just the immune treatment, but my guess is it would be mkre effective the first way. At least in my personal experience with this kind of thing I would think this could improve survival rates and reduce disabilities caused or worsened by surgery by not having to achive clean margin removal of the tumor. But who knows. Maybe in the future they can extract enough tumor DNA from blood draws to create the target. reply andyjohnson0 14 hours agorootparentprevFor this ourpose. Could a brain tumour be sampled by something less invasive like a needle biopsy? reply kjkjadksj 14 hours agorootparentThe treatment is probably more effective if you capture most/all of the tumor you can. For one, maybe that alone is good enough. For two, theres the fact that many tumors are a heterogenous mixture of populations of cancer cells rather than one clonal mass of cells that are genetically identical. There is a chance you might \"miss\" and fail to capture a particularly malignant population that might be rare at the time of surgery but might have distant metastasis before long. reply tsoukase 13 hours agorootparentprevProbably not.

Reverse-engineering and decompiling DOS software running in real mode and especially video games is a particularly tricky endeavor, a notch above other similar projects on other platforms. The combination of janky PC hardware, paper-thin MS-DOS operating system and prehistoric development tooling makes for an environment where anything goes. Real mode segmented memory and large memory models utterly confuse Ghidra's analyzers and decompiler, most common modern reverse-engineering tools either do not support 16-bit MS-DOS executables or have third-rate support. It is more art than science in a way that I don't think reverse-engineering later software can match. reply duskwuff 9 hours agoparentIt's a little awful to think about just how much collective human effort was wasted by segmented memory. Everyone knew that 32-bit flat memory was the future; it just took a long time for the PC platform to get there. reply skissane 1 hour agorootparentI think it was unfortunate Intel went with 16 byte paragraphs instead of 256 byte. With 256 byte paragraphs, you would have been able to address 16MB instead of 1MB in real mode. reply jandrese 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but when you are shipping computers with 256kb like the original PC/XT those extra two bytes per pointer start to look like a major luxury. There was a heroic amount of effort in those days to make due with as little memory as possible because memory was so expensive that nobody had more than was absolutely necessary. reply jojobas 2 hours agorootparentSegment:offset addresses were still 32 bits right? And most of the arseache was from the fact that the segments were overlapping as I understand. reply skissane 1 hour agorootparentYes, but if your program required no more than 64KB of data, then you could use near pointers everywhere, halving the pointer size from 4 bytes to 2 bytes. Also, even if the program as a whole required more than 64KB of data, if you knew you required no more than 64KB of data for objects of type X, then you could use 2 byte pointers for all type X objects, with a fixed data segment. X here might, for example, be strings. When you only have 256KB of RAM to begin with, the odds that all data overall, or at least all X object data for some X, will fit in 64KB is quite high. And if you have a lot of pointers, halving their size makes a big difference when you have so little memory. reply MagerValp 11 minutes agorootparentBut segmented memory isn’t a requirement, that technique works just as well with linear address space. You use a single 32-bit base pointer and then store 16-bit offsets for your data. We used that all the time on 68K and other architectures. reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah. I’m not going to defend x86 segment registers and real-mode DOS too vigorously. (I programmed in x86 assembler for many years.) But I’m pretty sure the right approach wasn’t to say Screw it.

I used to get around 1h of Internet time (modem) per week. I used this to download stuff that I could use for the rest of the week. One time I started downloading a game, but a bit too late so I never got to finish the download before my time was up. Of course the game would not work as it was only partially downloaded (IIRC it was a zip file, but not 100% sure). There was some message from Windows telling me that there was something wrong with the exe. But I continued trying to open the game over and over again (maybe fiddled with the properties?) and one day it magically started, ran for a while and then crashed. It was possible to restart it, but it would crash at the same point every time. It's still a mystery how it was possible, I guess it only had \"content\" left and the exe itself was fine, but that doesn't really explain why Windows initially refused to start it. reply p0w3n3d 2 hours agoprevMy beloved was a little bit newer DOS game F22 Lightning II. The best memories I have from it are when I was cycling through targets, and there was Air Force One which we were escorting.

I don't know the first thing about 3D programming. I tried to follow a book on writing a ray-tracer from scratch just to see if I could pick up the principles and do it myself, but I got frustrated by the ambiguity of the approach. Like I was trying to use Ruby with Rspec, but I'm not even sure if I'd run into a performance issue or not be implementing the interfaces correctly. I just want to know what method was used. Maybe 3D projection? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection Microprose had 3D flight simulators going back to 1984 on Atari 400/800, Commodore 64, and IBM PC.

That's really impressive. They weren't the only one though. Sublogic also had Flight Simulator II for those platforms. Which wasn't really combat focused (except for the sopwith camel minigame with the checkerboard and the cardboard mountains - lol). But it was also really impressive on such constrained platforms. Ok, it did about 1 frame per second and only rendered in wireframe on the Atari, but you could tune VOR and ADF radios, set weather etc. It was really impressive for an 8bit machine with 64kbyte. Sublogic later licensed their product to Microsoft to port it to PC which became Microsoft Flight Simulator. And the rest is history :) It was a bit weird because on the much more capable Amiga there was a flightsim game that wasn't even able to draw a tilted horizon if the gradient function was turned on. I forget which game it was, I think it might have been F-29 retaliator. reply cardinalfang 8 minutes agorootparentThe gradient might have been created using copper palette switching, which would cost no CPU time but only work with horizontal lines. reply ahefner 6 hours agoparentprevOn the NES (or other 6502 machines), use assembly. That CPU just isn't a good target for C - pointers are awkward, you can't really do stack frames, and the addressing modes don't even support 'structs' very well. Fun to program assembly on, though. For your purpose the NES makes it double hard because it hardly has any ram (2 KB, and typically an additional 8 KB inside each cartridge except in the oldest games), and a character-mode graphics architecture rather than a framebuffer. If you do really want to do an 8-bit flight sim, the Atari 400/800 machines are an okay target. The Atari ST would be a better target. Speaking of those machines, I'd love to see someone deeply reverse engineer the pseudo-voxel/fractal landscape engine that Lucasfilm Games invented for Rescue on Fractalus, Koronis Rift, etc. It still seems completely magical that they could pull that off on a machine with those specs. Starting from zero, you might start at a high level and work your way down. Do a simple polygon flight engine using OpenGL and your favorite high level language of choice. Then write your own polygon rasterizer that you can overlay versus the OpenGL rendering as a reference. Then maybe rework it in pseudo 8-bit code (C constrained to only unsigned char variables, or similar), which should translate directly to assembly language on the target of choice. On a real 8-bit machine, unless you want low single digit frame rates, you probably have to pull a lot of dirty tricks. Maybe a 16-bit platform would be a better choice. This is speculative - I learned 3D (to a novice degree..) on a 486 PC under 16-bit DOS using C and assembly for inner loops (bitblts, texture mapping). There's something about the aesthetic of late 80s PC flight sims (F-19 Stealth Fighter, LHX Attack Chopper, etc.) and their flat shaded polygon graphics that feels in vogue right now. Check out Thunder Helix on Steam. Anyway there's definitely a magical feeling writing graphics code when you get your first feeling of realistic movement and rotation in 3D space working. Hopefully the ubiquity of ultra-realistic doesn't diminish that sensation too much. reply qingcharles 2 hours agoparentprevI came across this yesterday which might be exactly what you're looking for (I even see an F-117A as the demo): https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-progra...

F-15 is not pseudo-3d at all. Flight simulators were early innovators in proper polygon based graphics. Partly because there were so few polygons they could get away with the painters algorithm. Partly because the instrument panel could cover a large chunk of the screen. But mostly because players of flight sims were willing to put up with very low frame rates, even 1 frame-per-second would be considered playable for certain types of flights. Anyway, the tricks used for the 8 bit computers and consoles were nothing more than distilling down the graphical complexity until all they really had to draw was a tilting horizon line and then use a few sprites for everything else. The one notable pseudo-3d technique I'll point out is the voxel based terrain used by \"Comanche: Maximum Overkill\". That's well documented. reply hooper 5 hours agoparentprevIf you're trying to do it all in software, you can get pretty far with a function to draw a solid colored triangle, a function to rotate 3d points using sin and cos, and some loops. Then the other pieces like lighting and texture mapping can be added pretty incrementally (depending on how obsessed you are with optimization). There are lots of interesting pages about this.

E.g. if it was a WW1 flight combat simulator, there would be a section on the history of aerial dogfighting and then specs on each plane. I know that nowadays it's common knowledge that most people don't read the manuals and it's easier to get people into a game with a combination first level /introduction/tutorial. That being said, I feel like we lost something by taking out the manuals with all that rich historical detail. reply wkat4242 2 hours agorootparentYes the Battle of Britain game (not by Microprose but LucasArts) actually came with a whole history book. I read it for English class, my teacher deemed it decent enough quality for that (English is not my primary language so picking high-quality literature wasn't really a priority). It really added so much to the game. Many other games came with cool things in the box too, like Wing Commander with the blueprints of each fighter. I guess part of the reason was that the games themselves weren't all that immersive. There were no cutscenes or long narrative. The tech simply wasn't there yet. The included box items made it more interesting and immersive. reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentprevI miss the simulation games of that era. They’ve pretty much faded away.

As such, a game running from a boot disk is closer to just skipping DOS and having no OS rather than implementing a custom OS, although from another perspective you might just say that the game is the OS. reply contingencies 5 hours agorootparentSort-of. IIRC DOS games that wanted to use more than 512KB(?) of memory had to use one of a series of particular high memory access drivers. HIGHMEM.SYS (\"XMS\"?), EMM386.SYS (\"EMS\"?), etc. You had to load these and other drivers (in particular sound and mouse drivers, antivirus programs, etc.) when booting up in your CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT. These were referred to as 'TSR' (terminate and stay resident) programs. There were all sorts of tricks to get things working... LOADHIGH, etc. In the end, most games required one particular approach to high memory, and you had to have a CONFIG.SYS/AUTOEXEC.BAT that left enough base memory free as well. It was a huge hassle. In later days most programs used DOS4GW ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS/4G ... which made things a lot easier. reply ajxs 3 hours agorootparentI was a 90s kid, and was totally head over heels for Origin Systems' games (Ultima, Wing Commander, etc). Par for course, I had a selection of DOS boot disks to set up the right operating environment for each game. Ultima VII featured a memory manager[0] based on 'Unreal Mode', which made getting it running even more precarious. The quote at the bottom of that link from the developer is really telling. 0: https://www.wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Voodoo_Memory_Manager reply contingencies 3 hours agorootparentDidn't get the Ultima series so never experienced that one, but an Origin Systems game I loved was System Shock. Still unbeaten in my book for raw experience as an early FPS RPG... so damn scary. It had so much complexity to the plot, it really set the bar high. I don't think it was matched until 15-20 years later ... many far more popular games were pathetically linear, simplistic and mono-dimensional by comparison. Other early games which left a mark for me: Heretic (which for unknown reasons performed very smoothly on my graphics hardware - Oak?), Descent (first really 3D game, excellent gameplay and many overnight sessions with friends), Dune II (defined the RTS genre on PC), Mechwarrior 2 (strongly immersive and awesome experience with a proper joystick), X-Wing/Tie Fighter (strongly immersive).

    "title": "Query Data Lakes Effortlessly with Pg_lakehouse",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_lakehouse",
    "originBody": "Overview pg_lakehouse is an extension that transforms Postgres into an analytical query engine over object stores like S3 and table formats like Delta Lake. Queries are pushed down to Apache DataFusion, which delivers excellent analytical performance. Combinations of the following object stores, table formats, and file formats are supported. Object Stores Amazon S3 S3-compatible object stores (e.g. MinIO) Local file system Google Cloud Storage (coming soon) Azure Blob Storage (coming soon) ...and potentially any service supported by Apache OpenDAL. See the Development section for instructions on how to add a service. File Formats Parquet CSV JSON Avro ORC (coming soon) Table Formats Delta Lake Apache Iceberg (coming soon) pg_lakehouse is supported on Postgres 14, 15, and 16. Support for Postgres 12 and 13 is coming soon. Motivation Today, a vast amount of non-operational data — events, metrics, historical snapshots, vendor data, etc. — is ingested into data lakes like S3. Querying this data by moving it into a cloud data warehouse or operating a new query engine is expensive and time consuming. The goal of pg_lakehouse is to enable this data to be queried directly from Postgres. This eliminates the need for new infrastructure, loss of data freshness, data movement, and non-Postgres dialects of other query engines. pg_lakehouse uses the foreign data wrapper (FDW) API to connect to any object store or table format and the executor hook API to push queries to DataFusion. While other FDWs like aws_s3 have existed in the Postgres extension ecosystem, these FDWs suffer from two limitations: Lack of support for most object stores, file, and table formats Too slow over large datasets to be a viable analytical engine pg_lakehouse differentiates itself by supporting a wide breadth of stores and formats (thanks to OpenDAL) and by being very fast (thanks to DataFusion). Getting Started The following example uses pg_lakehouse to query an example dataset of 3 million NYC taxi trips from January 2024, hosted in a public S3 bucket provided by ParadeDB. CREATE EXTENSION pg_lakehouse; CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER s3_wrapper HANDLER s3_fdw_handler VALIDATOR s3_fdw_validator; -- Provide S3 credentials CREATE SERVER s3_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER s3_wrapper OPTIONS (bucket 'paradedb-benchmarks', region 'us-east-1', allow_anonymous 'true'); -- Create foreign table CREATE FOREIGN TABLE trips ( \"VendorID\" INT, \"tpep_pickup_datetime\" TIMESTAMP, \"tpep_dropoff_datetime\" TIMESTAMP, \"passenger_count\" BIGINT, \"trip_distance\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"RatecodeID\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"store_and_fwd_flag\" TEXT, \"PULocationID\" REAL, \"DOLocationID\" REAL, \"payment_type\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"fare_amount\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"extra\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"mta_tax\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"tip_amount\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"tolls_amount\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"improvement_surcharge\" DOUBLE PRECISION, \"total_amount\" DOUBLE PRECISION ) SERVER s3_server OPTIONS (path 's3://paradedb-benchmarks/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet', extension 'parquet'); -- Success! Now you can query the remote Parquet file like a regular Postgres table SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips; count --------- 2964624 (1 row) Note that column names must be wrapped in double quotes to preserve uppercase letters. This is because DataFusion is case-sensitive and Postgres' foreign table column names must match the foreign table's column names exactly. Query Acceleration This extension uses Postgres hooks to intercept and push queries down to DataFusion. In order to enable these hooks, the extension must be added to shared_preload_libraries inside postgresql.conf. # Inside postgresql.conf shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_lakehouse' Inspecting the Foreign Schema The arrow_schema function displays the schema of a foreign table. This function is useful for verifying that the server and table credentials you've provided are valid. If the connection is successful and pg_lakehouse is able to read the foreign data, a table will be returned with the Arrow schema of the foreign table. Otherwise, an empty table will be returned or an error will be thrown. SELECT * FROM arrow_schema( server => 's3_server', path => 's3://paradedb-benchmarks/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet', extension => 'parquet' ); You can also use this function to decide what Postgres types to assign to each column of the foreign table. For instance, an Arrow Utf8 datatype should map to a Postgres TEXT, VARCHAR, or BPCHAR column. If an incompatible Postgres type is chosen, querying the table will fail. Connect an Object Store To connect your own object store, please refer to the documentation. Types Some types like date, timestamp, and timestamptz must be handled carefully. Please refer to the documentation. Development Install Rust To develop the extension, first install Rust via rustup. curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rssh rustup installrustup defaultNote: While it is possible to install Rust via your package manager, we recommend using rustup as we've observed inconcistencies with Homebrew's Rust installation on macOS. Then, install the PostgreSQL version of your choice using your system package manager. Here we provide the commands for the default PostgreSQL version used by this project: Install Postgres # macOS brew install postgresql@16 # Ubuntu wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.ascsudo apt-key add - sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list' sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-16 postgresql-server-dev-16 If you are using Postgres.app to manage your macOS PostgreSQL, you'll need to add the pg_config binary to your path before continuing: export PATH=\"$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin\" Install pgrx Then, install and initialize pgrx: # Note: Replace --pg16 with your version of Postgres, if different (i.e. --pg15, --pg14, etc.) cargo install --locked cargo-pgrx --version 0.11.3 # macOS arm64 cargo pgrx init --pg16=/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin/pg_config # macOS amd64 cargo pgrx init --pg16=/usr/local/opt/postgresql@16/bin/pg_config # Ubuntu cargo pgrx init --pg16=/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_config If you prefer to use a different version of Postgres, update the --pg flag accordingly. Note: While it is possible to develop using pgrx's own Postgres installation(s), via cargo pgrx init without specifying a pg_config path, we recommend using your system package manager's Postgres as we've observed inconsistent behaviours when using pgrx's. Adding a Service pg_lakehouse uses OpenDAL to integrate with various object stores. As of the time of writing, some — but not all — of the object stores supported by OpenDAL have been integrated. Adding support for a new object store is as straightforward as Adding the service feature to opendal in Cargo.toml. For instance, S3 requires services-s3. Creating a file in the fdw/ folder that implements the BaseFdw trait. For instance, fdw/s3.rs implements the S3 FDW. Registering the FDW in fdw/handler.rs. Running Tests We use cargo test as our runner for pg_lakehouse tests. Tests are conducted using testcontainers to manage testing containers like LocalStack. testcontainers will pull any Docker images that it requires to perform the test. You also need a running Postgres instance to run the tests. The test suite will look for a connection string on the DATABASE_URL environment variable. You can set this variable manually, or use .env file with contents like this: DATABASE_URL=postgres://@:/",

Wodehouse, creator of the character Jeeves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._G._Wodehouse Very clever naming! reply pas 12 hours agoparentSorry, what do you base that on? To me it just seems like a straightforward inspiration from the \"data lake\" -> \"lakehouse\" terminology that Databricks started (?) using. https://www.databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse edit: ah, but in a different comment someone noted that it's not actually a lakehouse, so who knows!? :) reply arduanika 12 hours agorootparentBased on pure speculation. I may be reaching. My best guess is that Databricks and Pg_lakehouse both independently coined \"lakehouse\" from \"data lake\", and that for the latter team, it was partly a pun on Wodehouse. But the creators are welcome to chime in and confirm/deny! (Or to say, like, \"Sure...uh, we totally meant that...yes we are very literary.\") reply philippemnoel 11 hours agorootparentI wish we were that clever, but it's really just the combination of \"data lake\" and \"data warehouse\", which isn't even coined by us :) reply tarasglek 4 hours agoprevI am not up to date in various lakes.

I'm having a hard time deciphering which might be the industry winner (or perhaps they both have a place, no \"winner\" necessary) reply retakeming 14 hours agoparentThis is anecdotal, but I feel that we (ParadeDB) have received more requests for Iceberg integration vs. Delta Lake. We were actually hesitant to launch pg_lakehouse without Iceberg support, but pulled the trigger on it because the iceberg-rust crate is still in its early days.

Tabular will likely be acquired by Snowflake and the two industry behemoths now back their own formats, and each will treat their own as a first class citizen. reply philippemnoel 12 hours agorootparentAgreed, this is why we want to support both. Maybe even Apache Hudi down the line. But I hope the industry converges to a main standard rather than Snowflake/Databricks fighting for their own formats. They can differentiate on much more meaningful features reply jaychia 5 hours agorootparentThere’s a lot of interesting work happening in this area (see: XTable). We are building a Python distributed query engine, and share a lot of the same frustrations… in fact until quite recently most of the table formats only had JVM client libraries and so integrating it purely natively with Daft was really difficult. We finally managed to get read integrations across Iceberg/DeltaLake/Hudi recently as all 3 now have Python/Rust-facing APIs. Funny enough, the only non-JVM implementation of Hudi was contributed by the Hudi team and currently still lives in our repo :D (https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft/tree/main/daft/hudi/pyh...) It’s still the case that these libraries still lag behind their JVM counterparts though, so it’s going to be a while before we see full support across the full featureset of each table format. But we’re definitely seeing a large appetite for working with table formats outside of the JVM ecosystem (e.g. in Python and Rust) reply philippemnoel 5 hours agorootparentAre you using the iceberg-rust crate for Rust? It's a rather young project, have you found it sufficient for your needs (if using)? reply kcirerick 13 hours agoparentprevI'm also building in the lakehouse space and anecdotally have seen more excitement around Iceberg over delta lake just because of its completely open source origins. Iceberg has evolved faster and has had more contributions from a more diverse set of contributors than Delta Lake. Not sure if this will change with a SnowflakeTabular acquisition but I'd easily bet on Iceberg if current trends continue. reply philippemnoel 13 hours agorootparentWe agree. We plan to bring Iceberg support as a first-class citizen as soon as we can, but unfortunately the support in Rust these days is still limited.

Do you plan to support Snowflake as an object store in the near future? It's not currently in pg_lakehouse's README. reply philippemnoel 5 hours agoparentSnowflake is not in the list of supported stores on Apache OpenDAL, so likely not. It might not expose its storage APIs. I doubt users of Snowflake would want a separate query engine anyways reply mcdonje 13 hours agoprevLooks like pg as a replacement for databricks sql, which is already a query engine for datalakes. It's not a lakehouse, but it calls itself one. Seems like a cool and useful project, but the name is problematic. reply retakeming 13 hours agoparentpg_house just wasn't as catchy! In all seriousness though, I see your point. While it's true that we don't provide the storage or table format, our belief is that companies actually want to own the data in their S3. We called it pg_lakehouse because it's the missing glue for companies already using Postgres + S3 + Delta Lake/Iceberg to have a lakehouse without new infrastructure. reply epsilonic 10 hours agoprevHow does this compare to Hydra? https://www.hydra.so/ reply philippemnoel 10 hours agoparentYou can see performance comparison to Hydra on ClickBench: https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/ by selecting ParadeDB and Hydra. Tl;dr: It is much faster. From a feature-set perspective, in addition to querying local disk, we can query remote object stores (S3, GCS, etc.), table format providers (Delta Lake, soon Iceberg too). From a code perspective, we're written in Rust on top of open-source standards like OpenDAL and DataFusion, while Hydra is their own codebase built from a fork of Citus columnar, in C. Hydra is a cool project. Hope this helps! :) reply sgt 2 hours agorootparentAnd when will you have GCS storage ready?

It's single node, but DataFusion parallelizes query execution across multiple cores. We do have plans for a distributed architecture, but we've found that you can get ~very~ far just by scaling up a single Postgres node. 2. The only information stored in Postgres are the options passed into the foreign data wrapper and the schema of the foreign table (this is standard for all Postgres foreign data wrappers). reply sdairs 13 hours agoprevVery cool! Could you share the key difference between this and the previous pg_analytics, and motivation of making it a separate plugin? reply retakeming 13 hours agoparentWhereas pg_analytics stores the data in Postgres block storage, pg_lakehouse does not use Postgres storage at all. This makes it a much simpler (and in our opinion, more elegant) extension. We learned that many of our users already stored their Parquet files in S3, so it made sense to connect directly to S3 rather than asking them to ingest those Parquet files into Postgres. It also accelerates the path to production readiness, since we're not touching Postgres internals (no need to mess with Postgres MVCC, write ahead logs, transactions, etc.) reply nitinreddy88 8 hours agorootparentIf users are already having datalake kind of system which is generating parquet files, the use case to use Postgres to query the data itself is questionable. I think having Postgres way of doing things should be prioritised if you want to keep your product in unique position. reply epsilonic 4 hours agorootparentCan you elaborate on what you mean by the \"Postgres way of doing things\"? Also, what is wrong with using Postgres to query data in external object stores? It is a common occurrence for businesses to store parquet artefacts in object storage, and querying them is often desirable. reply brunoqc 14 hours agoprevNice. I wish timescaledb open-sourced their s3 storage thing. reply philippemnoel 12 hours agoparentThey've been moving more and more towards closed source over the years, which is a shame but I understand why.

For me, it's a license that provides forward guarantees to the Community: no proprietary forks can happen, so any fork will be an OSS fork from which the upstream project may benefit too, which benefits all users. That's the reason we chose this license for StackGres [1], another project in the Postgres space. [1]: https://stackgres.io reply francoismassot 11 hours agorootparentprevWell, MongoDB was under AGPL v3.0 :) reply nikita 12 hours agorootparentprev [–] It looks like hyper scalers can still host it as long as they are publishing changes to the source code ? Am I reading the license right ? reply tomhallett 12 hours agorootparentFor aws to make it available on rds Aurora, would it be safe to assume there would have to be some changes to the extension source to make it compatible with the Aurora engine? If we assume aws doesn’t want todo that, then their licensing provides some protection there. reply philippemnoel 11 hours agorootparentYeah exactly. In practice, we've inspired ourselves from the likes of Citus and others who have adopted the AGPL-3.0 license as a good compromise and have found success. It's rather comment nowadays for infra startups to use AGPL-3.0. Other noteworthy examples: MinIO, Quickwit, Lago, etc. reply fulmicoton 9 hours agorootparentprev [–] Yes reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
