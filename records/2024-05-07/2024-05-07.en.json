(And yes Outlook is a pain and supports so very little!) We've tried building email templates for notifications for our apps where I work, and it has typically been a pain. We have since swapped to using mjml (https://mjml.io/) to build the templates, and it's working wonders. The output seems the be the most compatible with all different devices that we've tested on. The other tool we enjoy using is Litmus (https://litmus.com), which allows you to throw in an email template and see what it looks like on all kinds of apps and devices. Other thread here mentions https://testi.at/ as well, which we've also had success with. All of these have been really invaluable to designing emails for our apps. reply dabber 5 hours agoparentmjml looks really interesting, thanks for sharing. I wish there was a business reason for orgs to care about accessable and machine readable (I guess OCR is a thing now but still) emails. I've been using Foundation for Emails[1] for the very small number of emails that I've worked on which required more than just a list of img tags, and I really appreciate it for existing because HTML emails have been stuck in ie6 web days. [1]: https://get.foundation/emails.html reply varnaud 1 hour agorootparentI assume most email client support email with both html and txt content. If they don't support html or configured not to display it, the txt version is displayed. We have a html and txt template for each email we send. It's not exactly double the work, but it's appreciated by some of our customers. reply darekkay 3 hours agorootparentprev> I wish there was a business reason for orgs to care about accessable and machine readable emails. I hope the upcoming EU Accessibility Act will be enough for many organizations to finally make their emails accessible. I disable images by default in my email client, and some emails are pretty much empty without them, without providing any alternative. reply rjzzleep 56 minutes agoparentprev> What an excellent resource!

Though if outlook magically goes away we'll still make emails withbecause most clients still do not support even flex-direction. Outlook is just exceptionally bad with stuff like width:100px working on table elements, but not on , or padding working only on specific elements. reply easton 48 minutes agorootparentprevIt literally is, Outlook for Windows uses the IE9 engine to render HTML email, IIRC. And even then not everything is supported. reply GoblinSlayer 26 minutes agorootparentYou aren't trying to send an angular SPA in an email, are you? reply shortformblog 8 hours agoparentprevMJML is easily the best tool of its kind and I use it a lot.

Plain text content is the best content. reply StableAlkyne 9 hours agoparentThat's a completely valid opinion, and I prefer plaintext as well But at this point, it's pretty clear that most non-technical people prefer emails with fancy text and graphics. Personally, I'm just glad that email is a flexible enough medium to allow that. It's better than the alternative, where people moved to some closed, proprietary protocol behind like 20 patents that allows the same thing. Is there any other common way we communicate over screens (aside from http) that has had the staying power of email for the general public? I think that's a testament to the sheer flexibility of it. The ugliness that people have contorted email into is a badge of honor IMO reply throw0101c 8 hours agorootparent> But at this point, it's pretty clear that most non-technical people prefer emails with fancy text and graphics. And what percentage of e-mails from people / human beings have those things? Certainly marketing e-mails have fancy formats, but I've rarely seen any person at a companies I've worked at use any kind of formatting: generally most folks hit reply and start typing with whatever the default is. Hardly any italics or bold, and forget about fixed width (for things like CLI commands in technical discussions). Heck, even Slack messages these styles are hardly used (on my current team I use them the most since I know that Markdown so it's easy for me to throw in some **, //, or `` in my typing flow, so I can highlight hostnames, CLI commands, etc). reply Semaphor 7 hours agorootparentIf plain text would support inline-images, I’d probably be okay with it. But it doesn’t, so I’m not. I also generally prefer structured formatting to plain text. reply yau8edq12i 3 hours agorootparentprevYou must be joking. I write and receive emails containing lists, hyperlinks, or blockquotes all the time.

Anecdotally, I only get 2-3 actual human emails per _year_. Rest is transactional spam. reply kiwijamo 6 hours agorootparentThat's you. My work emails receives 25-50 real human a day. I get less than that amount in SMS in an whole year on my work phone. Even my personal email is significantly more email than SMS.

Plain text content is the best content. Your first statement might be true (it's debatable). Your second is definitely false. Lets assume that HTML really was the worst thing that ever happened to email. Plain text content for email is still not the best content. People want to: 1. Click on a link in the email, not fumble with copy and paste on their phone. 2. See decently formatted paragraphs and content with bold, italics and different font sizes for headings and paragraphs, not a wall of text. 3. See images in the email itself, not have to once again fumble around with copy and paste. 4. Correctly formatted bullet points, including sub-lists. For all of the above, some sort of format is required. If we exclude HTML as a possibility, you're still going to have to need a format of some type, because the wall-o-text format is not a good UI. reply ktosobcy 2 hours agorootparent1. all links are click-able at this point; what's more plain-text would force to provide just a link without all the tracking garbage 2. you can have paragraphs and headings... it's just a matter of structure - using html you can write a wall of text just fine 3. not sure if needed, besides you can attach images to plain text (though not inlining) or click-able links to external sources (at exact place) 4. still - easily do-able; it's a matter of particular editor tracking lists - for markdown editors it works just fine and in the end you virtually have a \"plain text bullet list\"... magic. The most contagious/problematic issue is (3) and inlining - as I said, it's possible to attach anything but the location is lost. Probably something simple like anchor (again, markdown linking comes to mind) to indicate placement would be just fine... (I loath html mails with passion…) reply lelanthran 1 hour agorootparent> 1. all links are click-able at this point; what's more plain-text would force to provide just a link without all the tracking garbage 2. you can have paragraphs and headings... it's just a matter of structure - using html you can write a wall of text just fine 3. not sure if needed, besides you can attach images to plain text (though not inlining) or click-able links to external sources (at exact place) 4. still - easily do-able; it's a matter of particular editor tracking lists - for markdown editors it works just fine and in the end you virtually have a \"plain text bullet list\"... magic. I think this comment displays the problems with plain text. I really couldn't have provided a better example. As regards the counterpoints: 1. All links are clickable Yes, and that's a bug. \"http://www.example.com\" should not be a clickable line. More to the point, it's not plain text anymore if the user gets something that has been interpreted and then rendered by the software. 2. It's not obvious how this should be done, and how it should reflow. You yourself failed to manage this in your reply, which I consider a good argument for why plain text is a poor UI. 3. Who cares whether you need it or not. The reality is that the clear majority of people use it! 4. Once again, if we're talking about a specific format that gets rendered into something readable, then it's not plain text anymore. I'm arguing against the GPs assertion that plain text is the best format, not that markdown is insufficient. reply rakoo 15 minutes agorootparentprev> what's more plain-text would force to provide just a link without all the tracking garbage I'm glad that you never ever received any link to some derivation of st.es.rui.tracking/bzzz/pfrrrrt?campaign=hn that hide the real link, but in the real world, that's how tracking is done. Plain text doesn't prevent anything. > not sure if needed, besides you can attach images to plain text (though not inlining) or click-able links to external sources (at exact place) For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem. From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software. You want to argue that plain text is better, but your arguments are that plain tex, are better for you. Don't make the mistake to assume that your specific experience is a workable average. reply ivanjermakov 2 hours agorootparentprevRegarding 1. it's up to the client to parse and highlight links in plain text. reply lelanthran 2 hours agorootparent> Regarding 1. it's up to the client to parse and highlight links in plain text. If the client is interpreting the content and then displaying its interpretation to the user, then it's not plain text anymore, is it? It's a format; in this case it's a poorly-specified, ad-hoc format and broken format[1] that is worse than simply having a reduced ad-hoc HTML format. Just like HTML is \"plain text\" which is interpreted by the client and that interpretation is displayed to the user. [1] For example, what if the sender types in `You should go to http://ww.example.com, where \"example\" must be replaced with your company name`? Suddenly `www.example.com` has an unintended DDoS! reply sanitycheck 2 hours agorootparentI imagine example.com is either set up to be robust enough to withstand that, or they don't care if it goes down: https://www.iana.org/help/example-domains Oh interesting, I pasted a URL in plain text and a bit of code in HN turned it into a link you can click on. I think it's totally fine for email clients to do that too. The only thing I find redeeming about HTML email is the ability to have inline images so when I'm illustrating some sort of process to somebody I can do it more clearly. Without those, I'd create and send a proper document (I don't object to attachments), or publish the information on a wiki/blog/etc - but perhaps a those would be overall better approaches than a 'rich' email. reply makapuf 3 hours agorootparentprevA subset of markdown (since you can use html in markdown) might be a good candidate. reply nox101 3 hours agoparentprevThis reads me as \"I prefer letters\" or \"I prefer fax\" HTML is what non-techies want, or rather, they want to insert pictures and videos directly inline. They want to bold and highlight. They want bullet lists and numbered lists. They want to change fonts, make headlines, etc.. And they want it all to reflow for their device. I do to. I don't want to say in the 70s terminal.

Paradise reply mavhc 4 minutes agoparentprevSurely lack of soft wrapping in the first version was the worst thing to happen to email, that breaks quoting, which leads to top posting. Also lack of a signature section, relying on weird -- hacks reply legitster 6 hours agoparentprev> Plain text content is the best content. Hard disagree. Things like bolding text, adding pictures, changing colors, etc are very important for the emails I send. So some amount of HTML is important to me. reply arp242 5 hours agorootparentLack of ability to distinguish between pre-formatted text and regular prose alone makes it a complete non-starter for most who aren't reading monospaced text in a terminal. I don't really like reading monospace text for prose (many people don't), and using proportional fonts means things that are supposed to be aligned will break (and if you restrict yourself to text only, you'll find yourself aligning things on occasion for tables or other content). I actually use plain text in FastMail because it's \"better\" than HTML (usually), but it's not good. Ability to send text/markdown natively would be pretty brilliant. reply ktosobcy 2 hours agorootparentprevplain-text with some sort of simple formatting would be fine (markdown/asciidoc). We don't have to go overboard in the opposite direction... reply HelmetFigNewton 4 hours agorootparentprevRTF would be fine, then. reply jordanreger 7 hours agoparentprevPretty much the only credit I'll give to Amazon is that they give the option to get plaintext emails. Doesn't mask the larger problems, but still a nice thing I wish was the norm. reply HelmetFigNewton 4 hours agorootparentAmazon deserves zero credit for anything regarding E-mail, because their \"order confirmations\" don't say WHAT YOU ORDERED. Mind-bogglingly stupid and annoying. reply derrikcurran 4 hours agorootparentI think that's because they don't want email providers, Gmail in particular, scraping for purchase history reply Dylan16807 5 hours agoparentprevWeird limited HTML isn't fun, but images, basic layout, and some amount of font control are all pretty important features. reply astrodust 9 hours agoparentprevIt's easy to say this, but can you imagine the hodge-podge of proprietary garbage we'd have to deal with if you couldn't email a simple file attachment to someone? reply smsm42 9 hours agorootparentI'm good with attachment when you need to send me a real document, but if the email text itself ends up being multi-megabyte blob because you absolutely must have your name in the signature in blue and italic, then I tend to frown upon this. Over decades of my work I probably sent thousands of emails, yet very rarely if ever I needed HTML capabilities, and pretty much never ones that go beyond very basic Markup formatting. reply feikname 9 hours agorootparentprevEmail attachments are defined through MIME and don't depend at all on HTML being available as a Content-Type. We could well have had another format and attachments together. reply djbusby 8 hours agorootparentYea! `text/rtf` FTW! reply hollerith 9 hours agorootparentprevI'm confused. How is HTML needed to attach a file (or to open the attachment)? reply astrodust 8 hours agorootparentMIME is needed, and with MIME, HTML is basically right there, so people are going to use it. reply hollerith 8 hours agorootparentHTML is not needed for attachments to work. If the government for example, banned all use of HTML in emails, people could still attach (non-HTML) files to emails the same way they do now. Therefore the comment I replied to, a defense of HTML in emails, is a bogus argument. reply anamexis 8 hours agorootparentThe point is that attachments are needed to make HTML work. If you have attachments, you have HTML emails. reply throw0101c 8 hours agorootparent> The point is that attachments are needed to make HTML work. They are not. MIME headers are helpful for telling MUAs what the content (type and/or disposition) of a message is, but there's nothing from stoping mail clients from just putting \"raw\" HTML in the body of an e-mail message without MIME. reply anamexis 8 hours agorootparentYes, obviously you could just email HTML before MIME existed. That's not the point of the discussion at hand. reply hollerith 7 hours agorootparentThis is bad logic, and so is your comment upthread, IMHO. reply arjvik 9 hours agorootparentprevCan still do plain text with attachments... unless you expect that companies would move to emailing you HTML files of their message? reply candiddevmike 9 hours agorootparentprevI think that hodge podge (OneDrive, Google drive, Dropbox, etc) is what most people already use. \"Simple file attachments\" are an oxymoron these days--size/extension restrictions, spam scores, not to mention the hell of iterating over email. reply kiwijamo 6 hours agorootparentDepends on your use case. Sometimes I want to send a document and not have the receiver change it at their whims. E.g. quotes for jobs. Simple attachments are great for that. Also I find some people who aren't good with tech find attachments much easier to deal with. If I send a an attachment I am 100% confident the other person can open it. No so for sharing links etc. reply cortesoft 5 hours agoparentprevI like being able to email in line photos reply idle_zealot 4 hours agoprevA fully-featured HTML \"document\" is really an application, not a document at all, so it makes sense that mail clients limit support. But this fragmentation makes me yearn for a real standard here, an official non-application subset of HTML that doesn't allow fetching remote resources or executing code. Just a document format with embedded media, animations, styling, etc. reply social_quotient 2 hours agoparentIs it a “document” if it has animations and non static (video) media? reply idle_zealot 1 hour agorootparentArguably?

XMLHttpRequest turned out to be revolutionary. It was only after triple whammy of Netscape being unable to further compete, the dotcom crash and the antitrust suit against Microsoft's integration between Windows and IE that IE got deprioritized by MS and slowly turned into the underfeatured mess every developer hated. reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparentIE for Mac was atrocious. Woz has some interesting thoughts about it in his book iWoz. reply kalleboo 4 hours agorootparentAlthough Netscape was even worse (if you resized the window, it reloaded the whole page), and IE for Mac at the time had the best CSS support out of any browser (it was a different renderer from IE Win). I did a lot of bouncing between browsers (Netscape/IE/iCab/Opera) back then until Mozilla came out and wiped everything else out. reply lolinder 9 hours agorootparentprevThat was a saying later in the game and among techies.

Emailing large file attachments is about as old and busted as FTP. There are so many other services to \"share\" large files.

That is not the point though. The point is that the vast majority of people prefer transactional / marketing emails in rich formatting.

Plenty of them. All of them are in a difficult situation because writing HTML for sucks. It REALLY sucks. Tools like this one help them (the developers!).

I don’t work in marketing. I just genuinely think HTML in email is actually a value add. Not everyone you disagree with works in marketing. Secondly: The problem you’re pointing at is bad implementation of standards, which is entirely on Microsoft and Google. (Mostly Microsoft.)

Honestly the main reason is that HTML/CSS expanded well over the creation of documents into the creation of apps.

That said, the lack of standards is definitely the worst aspect of all of this and resulted in the current absolute chaos reply ceejayoz 9 hours agorootparentprevThere's a vast spectrum of HTML email.

Personally, I don't have any need for HTML email in my daily life, and the only emails I occasionally get that are very obviously 'broken' in some way in plaintext mode are usually marketing emails or other messages I don't want to read in the first place. So, I figure, may as well keep it disabled since plaintext is more consistent and easier to read, and there is significantly less surface area for exploits when you don't need to bundle half a browser to view a couple of paragraphs. reply croes 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are valid reasons ro dislike HTML in emails https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/ And if we have to chose between bold letters or less malware, we should choose the latter. reply shortformblog 9 hours agorootparentBy this standard, we should go back to Lynx, because rich web browsers are way more dangerous than this extreme edge case that this guy invented because he doesn’t like HTML email. reply croes 5 hours agorootparentGuess why browser sandboxes, TLS and HTTPS exist?

When possible reduce your html code weight to the bare bones minimum. Nothing too fancy. Keep it logical. After a bit of practice it’s actually easy and in my opinion often faster than MJML (For example MailJet. Don’t even get me started on Klaviyo.) Even with minimal coding/hmtl experience you can run your code through GPT-4/Bard. Bonus for including custom instructions such as “transactional intent”, Bayesian/heuristic filtering, coded for users with poor digital accessibility, under-served internet users, etc. Even with the best domain domain/ip reputation without a positive engagement history specific to that user you will often land in promotions/other tab and not the primary tab for new users with a heavily weighted creative. Remember you want to mimic “an email from Grandma” while maintaining some degree of control of visual design. Or if that’s too complicated just keep your subject line under three words and all lowercase. reply kivlad 10 hours agoprevThe new Outlook desktop client is awful, but there's one silver lining and it's the retirement of the even more awful Word HTML renderer. reply chrismorgan 9 hours agoparentAre you sure?

It's easy and fairly intuitive to write (most of it, anyway). It's easy to read in different formats and ways (HTML, plain text). It doesn't add highly complex rendering issues.

Also yes. reply pavo-etc 7 hours agorootparentprevIf emails could be marked up with the subset of HTML that Markdown is able to generate without having inlined HTML tags, email markup would be so pleasant. Just bold/italics, some headings, tables, properly flowing text, code blocks, horizontal rule, links, and images. reply Eric_WVGG 6 hours agorootparentprevNot in the slightest. You can’t make elaborate layouts with Markdown. You can’t obfuscate text in images or make hidden links or inject JavaScript. Just some basic text styling (headers, italics, bold type), and images.

Thanks for the info. From what I'm reading, it seems that from inside an SVG script, you can call out to javascript functions of the parent page? That seems kinda surprising, I'm sure there are security policies around it, but it means that there are potential security and performance risks/considerations around hosting and serving SVG files that I didn't realize existed. reply barkbyte 9 hours agorootparentThe comment you’re replying to is misleading. SVG supports JavaScript but only if you load the SVG directly in your browser or inline it fully into the DOM. Using it as a normal image tag, by reference or with inlined data:, it’s inert and harmless from a JavaScript perspective. However, for a long time browsers were susceptible to denial of service attacks from maliciously crafted XML files, which SVG could exploit. (“Million laughs”). This doesn’t work in current versions but it might be a reason that SVGs are rejected. reply arp242 5 hours agorootparentRendering HTML emails in the browser is rather tricky business, because HTML/CSS isolation mechanisms are non-existent or come with a lot of caveats. You want to make sure your layout doesn't get screwed because of some bonkers HTML/CSS but you also don't want the intended layout of the email to be completely screwed. It's been a long while since I worked on this, but I was always very hesitant to make changes here, because we knew that our current thing worked for almost all customers, and you never knew what changes would break what. We dogfooded our own client, and at some point a change I made broke the automated SIDN (which manages .nl TLD) emails. I forgot what exactly it was, but they did some really weird stuff. You can't just shrug and say \"oh well, that's just crazy, fix your emails\" because people do need those emails and getting these types of organisations to take action is like moving a mountain. reply cypherpunks01 8 hours agorootparentprevAhh ok thanks for the clarification, that makes sense reply arjvik 9 hours agorootparentprevcan't Gmail support SVG without javascript? reply kcrwfrd_ 3 hours agoprevDark mode support in email is one of the most frustrating things I’ve dealt with as a frontend dev who’s been coding since the IE6 days.

    "originBody": "Manifesto GitHub Feedback Contact Try demo discussion Try new discussion The best way to have complex discussions by Anand Baburajan & Sreelakshmi Jayarajan We love complex, deep discussions. We've seen or been part of many discussions — strategic discussions at work, discussions on AI alignment, technical design documents, public policy, etc. For us, the most frustrating issues with discussions are: impulsive responses and lack of structure. The default way of discussions — in-person ones — are highly susceptible to impulsive responses and are extremely hard to provide a good structure for, making them the worst for complex topics. The first issue of impulsive responses is a hard nut to crack. Practising and advocating for active listening is the ideal solution but it's not guaranteed to work every time and in every team. That's why we prefer written, async discussions over in-person ones for complex topics — they help prevent impulsive responses to an extent (and even more with features like slow mode) and promote thoughtful responses. But the second issue still remains — written, async discussions lack structure too. If you've used chat/forum platforms like Slack and Discourse for complex discussions, you know how hard it is to follow comments there. DiscourseIn Discourse, discussions are a stream of unorganised comments. This way of discussion — where people talk over one another and topics get mixed up — doesn't work for deep dives into complex and lengthy topics. For such topics, the discussion needs to be carefully written and organised. There's no concept of “where” you are in Discourse discussions. There's only “when” you are, since the comments are ordered only by time. Discourse does provide some organisation to see the replies to a comment at one place. However if you need to see the replies to a particular reply inside a comment, you need to scroll down through other comments, find that particular reply (repeated as a comment!) and then check its replies: SlackSlack is not really built for written, async discussions, but since it's widely used, let's talk about it. Discussions there are a stream of unorganised comments too, but at least Slack has threads to discuss a particular comment in detail in a separate pane. However, if you want to discuss a comment inside a thread in detail (i.e., create a new thread from a thread), you can't — Slack allows only one level of threads. Moreover, Slack feels too chatty — it feels impossible to have a long-running async discussion there. Its UI encourages sending bursts of fast, short comments instead of well-formed thoughts, and the typing indicator keeps everyone else distracted while one person tries to form their idea. Quote hellNow behold the common annoyance in all chat/forum platforms — the quote hell. What's that? Let's say Ava puts a comment about something. Then Caleb puts a comment with his replies to some quotes from Ava's comment. Now Ava puts a comment with her replies to Caleb's replies in quotes. What's happening? Replies to a topic are spread across different comments and you're forced to mentally manage all those quotes and their replies! On top of that, there are unrelated comments between that break your flow. These problems might not seem big for a discussion between two people, but a complex and lengthy discussion with 5+ participants quickly turns into a huge mess. Here's what a quote hell looks like: After being frustrated with Slack, Discourse, etc., we started searching for a tool specifically built for complex discussions. We found none, began exploring how such a tool would work and look like, and started building: CQ2It's a free and open source tool for complex discussions. It's in its early stages, but it's the start of something that we think will both make discussions immensely enjoyable and radically increase productivity. We simulated a small discussion from LessWrong on CQ2. Check it out on the live demo, here! It turned out to be much better organised and easier to follow. In CQ2, there's no mess of unorganised comments — create threads inside threads so that each thread stays on topic and organised. Forget quote hell — create threads around specific quotes and find all replies related to a topic at one place. Never lose context of where you are — see all parent threads of the current thread in the same view. Focus on what matters — see which threads have unread comments, which are concluded and quickly go to a particular thread using CQ2's tree. Conclude threads — add conclusions to resolved threads and to the whole discussion once it's resolved. The CQ2 way of having complex discussions: StartingCreate a discussion by providing a title and a description. The description could be short or long, and is used to set the context, provide necessary information and/or your thoughts before starting the discussion. Then share the link with the participants. Commenting and creating threadsGeneral comments about the discussion go in the main (first and leftmost) thread. To reply to a particular text from the main description or from any comment, select the text, click on the popped-up “Reply in new thread” button to create a new thread around that specific quote, and reply there. You can reply to the whole comment as well, instead of a particular text inside it, by using the reply button on the top-right of the comment. Opening threadsIf someone has already created a thread for a particular quote, the quote would appear highlighted. You can click on it to open its corresponding thread and continue the discussion there. If someone has already created a thread for a whole comment, there would be a highlighted comments button on the top-right of the comment which you can click on to open the corresponding thread. NavigatingTo move between different threads, you can scroll using a trackpad or using your mouse's scroll wheel with the shift key. You can also use the tree from the navigation bar to quickly go to a particular thread. The tree also shows the number of comments in a thread, the number of unread comments and whether the thread has been concluded. ConcludingYou can conclude a thread by using the “Conclude thread” button on top of the thread. Concluded threads have a green badge on top and the conclusion comment in green. To conclude the whole discussion, use the “Conclude discussion” button in the navigation bar. Try creating some threads and adding some comments in the demo, here! We have many more interesting and useful features planned, including rich text, workspaces, custom titles for threads, mentions, slow mode, useful reactions (and not just emojis) and even an AI assistant to help you find overlooked parts of the discussion. With CQ2, we want to help people have better discussions, and ultimately, systematically arrive at truth, better understand others and make better decisions. If you resonate with CQ2's mission, we would love for you to try it out, provide your feedback here and share this post with your friends! Get early access, here. CQ2 is not optimized for mobile use.

(cq2.co)403 points by anandbaburajan 15 hours agohidepastfavorite185 comments layer8 12 hours ago> we started searching for a tool specifically built for complex discussions. We found none This was basically solved in Usenet, more specifically, in news reader software. You had a clearly arranged threaded view (you could see the thread structure of as many as 50 postings on a single screen), with unread threads and unread postings highlighted, and pressing Tab jumped to the next unread posting. Unread status was per posting/comment, not by time. Many more conveniences for quick navigation, filtering, and so on. All newer discussion platforms have been a step back in terms of efficiency of use and ability for deep, long running discussions. Initially due to web browser limitations (though nowadays that shouldn’t be much of a problem anymore), and later due to mobile touch interfaces (still poses some difficulties). reply tptacek 6 hours agoparentI have a very hard time connecting this to my lived experience of Usenet, which was full of top- and bottom- quoted posts, broken threads, and routine missing posts that sometimes left people talking past each other for days. I dearly loved Usenet; it started my career. But I don't miss it. Even before you get to basic affordances like posts, moderation and sorting, and following specific people, the basic nuts-and-bolts experience of discussing topics on Usenet was worse than it is today on Reddit, Usenet's rightful heir. reply fifticon 33 minutes agorootparentI disagree with this; I lived through this switch. The problem might be that it was a paradigm shift; I realize what reddit does is not something USENET could be scaled to(?). Using USENET across multiple decades, I was used to following certain groups meticulously, tracking and reading whatever new items appeared. In particular, the news reader application - NN - had very solid tools for browsing and tracking discussions. When set up correctly, I could work through updates by pressing the space-bar to page through them. Reddit, and the even worse lesser forums, loses pretty much all of that. Browsing reddit, for me, feels more like watching a mix of a river with flotsam drifting by, a busy traffic street, uncoordinated fireworks, and a tornado ripping through a midwestern city. There are no tools to track what you have and haven't read already, or what new comments have appeared. You cannot sort and filter the posts properly, the best you get is a \"do you feel lucky?\" search, which often shows that \"no, you weren't lucky today\". On low-traffic subreddits, it IS possible to track new stuff, but you have to do so manually. I offer no solutions, I don't know how to effectively do highquality discussions for 6 or 7 billion people. reply skrebbel 2 hours agorootparentprevThis must've differed a lot between usenet groups then; the ones I was on strictly followed a bottom (or infix) posting pattern and would chastise people who did it differently. reply navane 1 hour agorootparentSo the culture enforced the discussion format, not the technology. Technically we could be all writing in a giant Notepad file, and adhere to any discussion format. reply straight-shoota 1 hour agorootparentThat's basically how discussions work in Wikipedia (and other MediaWiki projects). Discussion pages are just a giant text file which anyone can edit fully. The only extra feature over Notepad is an implicit edit history. reply saurik 9 hours agoparentprevFWIW, many email clients -- before Gmail dumbed down email forever and no one seems to understand that email replies form a tree anymore -- also had (and maybe some still do?) that way of viewing the world. reply dredmorbius 6 hours agorootparentThere arae numerous email clients for Linux-like platforms that provide this, both text-based adn GUI.

This makes checking for new comments tedious, and prevents any longer discussions. reply xyzzy_plugh 7 hours agorootparentprevThe HN comment system discourages depth as there is a relatively shallow limit to threads. There also is no in-built concept of an inbox to monitor replies. reply alcover 1 hour agorootparentThis baffles me so much. It would be so simple and valuable to add. reply makeitdouble 12 hours agoparentprevYes. The only critical issue I'd see with Usenet's client interfaces would be linking cross threads. At some point a thrrad becomes irrelevant because of parallel discussions in other threads, being able to easily redirect to a specific point in another thread helps a lot. But that requires an URL, and messages ids weren't used for that purpose. reply layer8 11 hours agorootparentI actually remember using message IDs to reference other postings. Newsreaders had commands to jump to a certain message ID. You had to copy the message ID from the posting, but on Unix that was just a double-click, and a middle-click to paste, so quickly accomplished. reply uoaei 11 hours agoparentprevZulip has many of these features I believe. Anecdotally it seems to be great for running an online discussion forum for a high school or college level class. reply smallerfish 10 hours agorootparentTwist is a better Zulip. Zulip has some awful UX decisions, though the chat experience is definitely a step up on Slack. reply stavros 55 minutes agorootparentI love Zulip, but Twist's free tier seems to be restricted enough that I'm put off trying it. Maybe a month of retention is OK practically, but I'd hate losing conversations if I don't end up needing it enough to pay, so I'm not even inclined to try. reply tiffanyh 9 hours agorootparentprevTwist is hugely underrated and doesn’t get the attention it deserves. reply abdullahkhalids 11 hours agorootparentprevI used Zulip last week to ask a question on Lean on their community.

Imagine HN or Reddit, but virtually every post in every thread quotes huge chunks of preceding posts, often many layers deep. Randomly remove comments from threads; remove different comments from different servers at different times, to make sure nobody sees the exact same content. Eliminate search. Eliminate all but the most blunt-force moderation. Eliminate user profiles, or following particular users. Divide the universe into a global taxonomy of discussion topics, then allow people to cross-post from one to the other, starting firestorms of confused argument and complaint. Wait 2-12 hours for your discussion partners to see your as they move peristaltically through the store-and-forward NNTP system. Expire all history after a week or so. Every once in awhile, just for fun, drop a 50-comment-long chain of uuencoded binary chunks into the middle of your debate about Lisp. Usenet was one of the first systems of its kind, and it's no wonder people look back on it wistfully. It was wild, being able to talk (or argue, or flame, or troll) people all around the world at every hour of the day. Usenet was amazing. So was the Sony Vaio. You wouldn't want to use it today, though. reply kazinator 1 hour agorootparentI don't know what you're talking about. I use Usenet daily. Usenet is the best forum system out there; everything web thing is just a ghetto/silo. reply layer8 12 hours agorootparentprevUsenet died due to spam. Newsgroups were unmoderated by default, and moderation wasn’t built into the protocol. Then PHP web forums took over because they were discoverable by web search and only required the web browser that you had anyway. They also added support for popular features like posting images and using emoticons graphics, instead of only text (though the latter hasn’t hurt HN). reply tap-snap-or-nap 50 minutes agorootparentThese systems were developed before unsolicited commercial promotions started flooding these mediums, later, automation made it worse. reply jll29 12 hours agorootparentprevWe may distinguish between USENET the public network that is part of the Internet (considerd \"out of date\" by many because it is not Web based, and indeed suffering from spam) and the USENET protocol, which you can use to set up your private version of USENET-like discussion groups. In fact, many organizations had (and some still may have) inhouse groups, often prefixed \"local.\" e.g. \"local.events\", \"local.jokes\" etc. Advantage: threaded discussions, open standard (many existing open source readers e.g. Emacs: M-x gnus) reply wolverine876 11 hours agorootparentprev> Usenet died due to spam.

For the general public, of course, moderation is indispensable. The spam in Usenet began when businesses and scammers discovered Usenet. My point in the root comment is that Usenet clients contained all the ingredients for efficient, structured, long-running, deep discussion, and those are orthogonal to moderation, which you nowadays need in any case. reply aeternum 6 hours agorootparentThe problem with Usenet style interfaces isn't just spam, it's low value comments. Comment voting somewhat solves this but most people vote based upon how much they agree rather than the comment's discussion value. reply layer8 5 hours agorootparentThis should be solved by moderation when necessary, like in traditional web forums. I agree that voting is a bad mechanism, because people then start posting for likes and reaction stats, and also involuntarily judge posts by their like count instead of only by their own judgement. Flagging/reporting to moderators is fine. reply aeternum 4 hours agorootparentI'm not sure moderation is that much better.

But the real value is quite different. reply James_K 14 hours agoprevAs much as they have a bad reputation, I think the image board style of comments is the best for these kinds of discussions. Each post has a unique ID, and you can insert links to other posts in the text of your post. Then each post is given a set of back-links showing all posts that quote it. In this way, posts form a hyperlinked network that you can traverse relatively easily, while also being displayed in chronological order. I've found this quite effective for long-form discussion. My only complaint would be that structure is needlessly limited. It would be better if posts simply formed a connected graph of content which you could ask the website to present in arbitrary ways. This project reminds me a lot of Xanadu in its layout. I don't really think this complex of an interface is necessary. In fact, it might get in the way of productive discussion. I find that the constraints on other mediums (character limits, reply depth, etc.) often aid clarity. The transmission of information between people is fundamentally linear, and so you are pretty much always just going to be composing short essays and exchanging them as the basis of any real discussion. Complicated features seem like they would obstruct this. reply basch 13 hours agoparentDespite all the attempts to improve upon the basics, hyperlinks really are better than almost everything that’s come after them. reply hypercube33 13 hours agorootparentHyperCards need to make a comeback reply barnabyjones 8 hours agoparentprevI think the key part of the UX there is the instant pop-up visibility of the linked comment when you hover over it.

And if you accidentally click the wrong place or hit back too many times, it's easy to lose your place. reply James_K 8 hours agorootparentMost imageboards will show you the post if you hover over a link to it. This technology is decades old. reply drones 7 hours agoparentprevThe downside of this approach is the redundancy of information. If multiple conversations are happening at once, it's hard to follow what people are saying about a particular one.

Interesting. reply basil-rash 14 hours agoprevThe best way IMO is still (somehow) a 4chan-style linear timeline, with heavy UI affordances to make following >-ref’s simple. This application (and HN, and Reddit) go with the “threads on threads on threads” tree, which is awful for when you want to respond to a specific subset of replies to the same parent comment at once. How could it be improved? I say embrace the DAG nature of the beast and allow for selecting a specific set of parent nodes a comment is in reply to, and, importantly, make that set editable so when some other person comes in and replies to a comment with a topic that has already been discussed, you can link your earlier replay to that new parent without needing a “see my reply here” comment. reply playingalong 13 hours agoparentThat possibly works for quiet discussions, say B->A (where -> means responds to). OTOH I'm not sure that cycles are even a huge problem. reply James_K 10 hours agorootparentThey probably aren't a problem, but they might be. I can see there potentially being some graph theory optimisations on the server side you can do if you know you're dealing with a DAG. > And your DAG ends up A'->B->A A' would be in response to A. reply readyman 12 hours agorootparentprevOr each edit forms a new \"edit\" node that new replies are then connected to. Regardless, the DAG can always be preserved somehow. reply basil-rash 11 hours agorootparentprevYou could edit a comment to violate the DAG criterion, but not every edit that references a prior node must result in violation of the DAG. Those edits which would result in a violation should be prohibited. reply pkoiralap 13 hours agoparentprevDAG does seem natural here. Having a LLM add metadata to the nodes can make this even cooler. For instance, person A presents statement Sa. Person B comments on person A's statement, Sba and person C comments on person A's statement, Sca. The viewers now, especially new parties that are joining the conversation, would be able to see that Sba agrees to most of Sa said, but refutes a fact said by Sa. Sca doesn't agree with anything Sa is saying. Another example would be, nodes getting more weight as more people agree with it and smaller as more people disagree. Obviously, the implementation and implications are boundless. reply basil-rash 10 hours agorootparentAn idea I’ve been playing around with in my head for some time is to have LLM’s play a role in somehow generating an idealized debate structure of any given topic. For example, given the prompt “Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!”, many actors (LLM’s, humans, etc) would submit top level replies to a hidden container. Eventually, an LLM would look over all the replies and cluster them into a small number of “essential responses”. The process repeats with each of these responses being new top level nodes. Eventually, a tree/dag/graph/something is created that recursively contains all the things one might have to say about the topic at hand. reply brody_hamer 10 hours agorootparentI really like this idea. Maybe it wouldn’t work for internet chats, but for discussing complex topics as a team? Yes! reply dleeftink 10 hours agorootparentprevAlthough the discussion structure may be different from Fb/Twitter-like platforms, how does this approach mitigate or go around algorithmic curation issues?

Wish this could work, but my experience is that getting people to use even the first layer of threads is very difficult, especially non-technical people. IMO most often complex discussions will devolve into a \"let's just jump on a quick call to settle this\", for better or worse. The feature I am looking forward to the most in comminication apps is having a machine learning model listen to those \"quick calls\", generate summary and action items and post them right back in the thread. You get the benefits of both worlds that way. reply zbentley 13 hours agoparent> getting people to use even the first layer of threads is very difficult, especially non-technical people I've found that as well. I wonder why that is--many times I've been working with someone who is extremely intelligent and methodical as an individual, but structured communication totally breaks down as soon threads enter the picture. Interestingly, this sometimes even happens verbally (at work, when doing tech support on either side of the phone, at feedback discussions with artists/writers, when talking with friends): some folks really do not like \"zeroing in\" on specific sub-discussion items, talking them out, then moving on or going back to the bigger picture. Instead, they like to jump around or \"chroot\" the discussion to whatever the most recent topic of interest is. Anecdotally, it's very much a \"two kinds of people\" situation, but I don't know what the common factor is (and again, I don't think this is a skill/bad-faith issue; these are smart and reasonable people. They just ... don't think in trees or stacks). reply SoftTalker 13 hours agorootparentBecause nested threads get so deep into the weeds that the eyes start to glaze over. I liked the old Joel on Software boards. No threads, messages posted sequentially as they are created. If you want to quote, do it manually. I feel like discussion stayed on topic or at least evolved sensibly, there were no deep tangents on pedantic matters that pushed the rest of the messages off the bottom of the page. Edit: here's a post where Joel talks about the design of his forums. https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/03/03/building-communiti... I think there's a lot of good sense in there, if you are too young to remember, the JoS forums were the \"Hacker News\" of their time, a place where programmers and other people involved in software businesses had online discussions about a number of interesting things. Those forums were even simpler than HN is -- no threads, no replies to individual posts. You could read comments in linear order, and post your comment after scrolling to the bottom. That's it. reply James_K 13 hours agorootparentprevFor the verbal phenomenon, I think that is just a symptom of human brain function. Only a small amount of processing is conscious verbalisation, so you will need to talk about new things while your subconscious processes other ones. As for online, I think the idea of threads is obviously antithetical to the concept of linear discussion. When you organise things as a tree, you present the many branches as though each is a valid target for a new entry. If you want things to be discussed linearly, you must present that discussion linearly. This linear discussion is feasible only in text, as you have time to think something over before verbalising it. reply epolanski 12 hours agoparentprev> IMO most often complex discussions will devolve into a \"let's just jump on a quick call to settle this\", for better or worse. The issue then isn't about communication but decision making. Complex topics, for the reasons listed in the linked blog post, should not end up in \"let's settle this over a talk\". I personally, to this date, consider moderated vBulletin/phpBB-like forums the highest form of long term communication online. There are active discussion threads on many forums I follow that are decades old. reply jijijijij 12 hours agoparentprevAlthough technically tempting, I think most people don't want to have a transcript/recording of person to person calls, especially in a work context. Even if you aim for \"just\" an AI summary, there has to be a recording, there has to be a transcript somewhere. Do you trust in the promise of deletion? Self-censorship, preference and knowledge falsification come to mind. People behave differently when there is no expectation of privacy, when they know they're observed. Apart from employment consequences, social alienation and mental health impact, panopticism may negatively affect creativity and innovation, when people behave less impulsive and more agreeable. In my practical experience, (local) transcription also tends to be anything, but instant, if you don't allocate significant compute to the task. So your summary may not be available for some time after the call ended. You may need to cognitively backtrack quite a bit to confirm plausibility/\"correctness\" of the AI production. Management will love it, everyone else will grow to hate it. For me, at least, private personal talks/calls are the last bastion of interpersonal bonding and social relief in the modern (remote) work environment. reply MyFedora 6 hours agorootparentIf you can't trust your coworkers, it might be a sign that it's time to move on. A healthy workplace relies on a certain level of trust. We already naturally adjust our behavior depending on whether we're with friends, family, coworkers, or supervisors. If your boss is having an affair with the receptionist, you're not going to bring that up in a team meeting. That's self-censorship at play, without any need for surveillance or written records. Regarding the mental health impact of workplace surveillance, I've never encountered someone explicitly linking their stress or burnout to call transcripts or AI-generated meeting summaries. Many complaints I've heard about mental health tend to focus on these issues: * Excessive workloads from bosses or coworkers with no recognition. * Transfer to toxic work environments engineered to make you quit a year before retirement. * Invasive management that gets too involved in your personal life, knowing details you never told them. * Boss sharing personal (sometimes even health) information with coworkers. * Being called into work even when on vacation. * Soul-crushing jobs with high stress, like call centers. * An imbalanced work-life dynamic, leaving no time for family or personal care. * Persistent crunch time with no relief. * Office politics with gossip and backstabbing. * Workplace mobbing. * A number of personal issues that I'm not going to list here. These are some reasons employees face burnout and dissatisfaction at work. While I'm open to hearing more about the potential mental health impact of call transcripts or AI-generated meeting summaries, it's not something that appears in the complaints I've come across. reply samus 3 hours agorootparentThat trust should not rely on people having to censure themselves all the time, since that would be harmful for an organization's performance in the long run. And a lot comes down to how that criticism is delivered. reply MyFedora 4 minutes agorootparentSelf-censorship is a natural part of social interactions; it's what allows us to navigate complex relationships and maintain harmony in a workplace. Consider all those intrusive thoughts you’ve had—the ones you chose not to voice because they were inappropriate or would create conflict. Our ability to filter what we say is key to functioning in social settings. It's like a skill we take for granted. When you see people with certain mental disabilities who can't regulate their words, it quickly makes you realize why self-censorship matters. It's a critical tool for keeping things from descending into chaos. The question isn't whether self-censorship is necessary, but rather, how much is appropriate. I shared the example of someone who revealed a boss's affair during a team meeting. It was a moment of impulsiveness that led to serious career consequences, to put it mildly. reply makeitdouble 11 hours agorootparentprevA different angle: cutting private personal talks and interpersonal bonding can help a lot in remote environments. It might feel paradoxal, but as there's little context on each other's private life in the first place, private talk stays limited and trite (basically close to grocery lane small talk) For instance imagine having a call for reworking a service and the other side starts asking what you did during the weekend, which happens to be medical follow up for your kids on the spectrum. Either you start explaining all your life, or you just cut it down and deal with the purpose of the meeting. There's of course a ton of personal preference, some people thrive in grocery lane talks. I just wouldn't expect most people to be so. reply jijijijij 11 hours agorootparentLuckily I managed to avoid socially alienated work environments so far. I actually enjoy working even. I presume the vast majority of humans needs and enjoys social warmth, and a personal connection. You can escalate almost any conversation out of grocery lane talk with one or two questions, so your experience is maybe a bit on you, too. Also don't shun chitchat, there is subtext, belonging and trust building encoded. It's an offer and a compliment. Apart from basic needs, this also creates an environment more resilient to worker exploitation. reply makeitdouble 8 hours agorootparent> social warmth, and a personal connection Yes, definitely, though people going the full-remote route tend to get enough of it to not seek more in the work environment.

Discussions are fun during offline events/retreats, just not during the meetings. > resilient to worker exploitation. Thanks, this is an important angle I didn't consider.

It's hard to \"finish\" digesting a series of replies at once. I think I'd prefer Discourse's current linear format, where all new replies are stacked at the bottom (but ideally with a quoted snippet for context). It makes catching up on updates easier, since you just keep scrolling and reading like any other document. IMO it often isn't super useful to go through each individual comment piecemeal unless you're working on a document together (ie tracking changes and commenting on them). Otherwise, being able to read through several comments at once and THEN replying to the whole of them in a summary can save everyone time. It's the infinite back and forth on every minor point that makes long form discussion impossible to track. That's the sort of thing that probably IS better dealt with in real time, over Slack or a call, and then summarized briefly back in the main convo.

Well, that certainly does look deeply complex, so I have no reason to think it wouldn't create deeply complex discussions. Kidding aside, one thing I like about it is that it makes discussions start around specific snippets of a source text. That is to say, you begin a thread by selecting a piece of text. I am always very skeptical of top-level comments on HN that don't begin with a quote from the article being discussed—more often than not, I am suspicious that the person even read the text before commenting. That doesn't address how you'd have conversations around anything except a block of text. Videos, pictures, games or applications, etc. And they don't solve the toughest UX problem with this kind of pattern, which is how you treat overlapping excerpts: are they part of the same thread, or a new thread, and how do you define the boundary? reply WA 2 hours agoparentBut if a new reply doesn't address a single thing in the parent post, but merely the gist of it or adds an entirely new argument, there's no need to quote an exact sentence. reply danjl 13 hours agoprevVisuals are the big missing piece. Any text-based discussion will build different visions in each reader's head. Often, everyone agrees on the text description, and then, when a designer draws a picture, everyone disagrees because they weren't really aligned, they all assumed everyone shared their own personal vision. I love the concept of building a better way of discussing things asynchronously, but I would put visuals (images, videos, diagrams) at the center of that forum and overcome the biggest issue with visuals -- that they are often hard to make for many people. All the mentioned alternatives tie comments to a particular user and relate comments (responses) to other comments. Instead, the conversation could be focused on the topic of discussion, which is often best described as a set of visuals describing the concept. Rather than responding to comments, you could organize comments around the associated component of the problem as it is described visually. This would allow multiple individuals to support a concept, rather than just amplifying or criticizing a particular user's comment. This might even help avoid defensive behavior since the problem is the focus rather than a particular person's comment. reply danjl 12 hours agoparentHeh, perhaps you could use the text comments to constantly update a visual description generated by AI? That way, nobody needs to make a drawing. Conversely, nobody has direct control over the visuals. I envision a UI where people type their comment into a text box, that comment is sent to the server which is constantly updating the \"visuals that describe the idea\". Each client updates their UI with the new visuals along with providing some way of attaching all the comments to the visual images/videos/diagrams. IOW, the AI-generated visuals are the center of the client UI, rather than just a scrolling tape of comments. Clients can then navigate the discussion by diving into different components of the discussion. Maybe there's even an AI-generated summary of some sort. Essentially, the AI is playing the role of a Designer drawing pictures in a side channel and a smart assistant who is constantly updating a summary abstract. reply aspenmayer 9 hours agorootparentI like your ideas here, and for some reason your comments remind me of the vision of Google Wave, which was much hyped but suffered in my opinion from its lack of usage.

I'd like to point out the issue with these kinds of threaded discussions for non-complex discussions, including the simpler nodes of complex discussions. And that is that people often have a hard time figuring out which thread node to reply to in a more complicated discussion system. For the most part it's easy for engineer types, but most normies often find them confusing.

Whatever the right structure is, I think it's partition tolerant. Any party needs to be able to disconnect themselves from any other party such that: - everything not reliant on that trust edge still works (the web would struggle with this) - the untrusted party has no ability to censor the revoker, even if they're well trusted by the others (blockchains will struggle with this) I've been tossing around ideas for what the ideal protocol would look like.

Also, thank you for your insights. About \"Open Insight\", I think it's not so open at the moment, since I couldn't find any kind of code repository. Maybe it is at an early design phase. Decidim.org is made with Ruby on Rails (good for fast prototyping, but a questionable choice for a critical system, IMHO). reply SamBam 13 hours agoprevI've wanted to create something like this for a long time. I've always wanted a threaded system where you can respond to a single line of text. One thing I wonder is how this can best be extended to argumentative discourses where much of the discussion is a dispute of facts. Of course you could do that with this, but it won't be clear looking at the comment tree whether people agree on what facts, if any, are correct. I wonder if this could be extended (or have a mode) that requires consensus on whether a thread is concluded (instead of one person deciding), which could be as simple as keeping the current UI but allowing the people the option to re-open threads; and the ability to attach summary statements to threads which percolate up to the thread's branch point. reply photonthug 6 hours agoparent> One thing I wonder is how this can best be extended to argumentative discourses where much of the discussion is a dispute of facts. This is what I always think about when the topic of structured argument/discussion comes up, but everyone wants to focus on aspects of the threading. We are still totally missing a n obvious layer or organization, such as splitting sub comments into categories like disputes-parent and supports-parent and asks-clarification and elaborates-parent. We’re missing flags for ad-hom and logical fallacies and all the nuance of discussion has degenerated into up/down votes . And we are missing the ability to collapse or zip up any finished meandering paths once there is consensus/clarity on the subtopic. Since all we do is debate bullshit on the internet it’s surprising that we’re still so disorganized and ineffective at it! There’s definitely a sweet spot somewhere between this baby talk that we’re all engaged in and the rigors of things like lawyery jargon / math / Loglan. But we’re not even close yet. reply neon_me 1 hour agoprevBroken scroll on android/firefox. Complex things are only for apple kids :( reply sanitycheck 12 hours agoprevI quite like the \"conclude thread\" concept (though I couldn't get that button to do anything in the demo), and I'm one of those strange people who would like infinitely nested threads in Slack too... But the issue with threads is always that people who aren't involved the side-discussion generally never read them. I think it might be nice to have every thread \"concluded\" with a \"result\" (summary, outcome, to-do list, etc) which is then injected back into the parent where everybody will see it. It could be manual, or it could be semi-automated with a LLM - I'm not generally a fan but this seems like a reasonable use case. I'd ideally like all the nested threads to naturally turn into a single linear summary of everything important that was decided. The CQ2 thing also looks a bit too document-oriented, might be a good fit for a wiki or something like that but I think being able to open a thread for every single word is too fine-grained for a typical discussion. reply robviren 7 hours agoprevAt this point I am convinced any meeting with more than six people is a poor way to have a complex discussion.

What I would want to see is a clear path to reaching consensus documents. Comments-upon-comments makes it hard to get an idea of what the overall consensus is. You pretty much need to read all of it and explore every comment thread to understand what are the generally agreed parts and what are the more controversial takes(?). Maybe some hybrid between this and Wikipedia? reply glassofbees 11 hours agoparentYou could maybe achieve that with this design if a summary could be set for resolved discussions and shown at a higher level (eg. when hovering over the source text of a thread). Having the ability to differentiate between a resolved, useful thread and a resolved but ultimately unnecessary thread might also help avoid noise. reply tony-allan 9 hours agoprevA great idea. Some personal thoughts: 1. I would like to be able to see all the comments from selected people (myself by default). 2. I would like to be able to un-conclude a thread for the fat-fingered among us. 3. As I hover over the document, if there are comments, I would love to see the comment count to judge the activity (or something to show hotspots -- now or over time). 4. I would like to be able to start a discussion with an external markdown file. 5. An API to access updates (including real-time changes) would be excellent. I've also dropped these in the Github comments. reply WuxiFingerHold 7 hours agoprevThis is brilliant and I hope every serious project switches off of Discord.

It's interesting that most people view debate as \"who can make flashier speeches?\" when the skills are more so about tracking and participating in very lengthy discussions.

Sad to see it at the bottom. Wave was, IMHO, the UI paradigm of the future for this sort of thing. I have hope that it was just too far ahead of it's time and something like it will catch on again. I think the problem it suffered from, besides being a little too \"out there\" for the average user, was that it required to much careful attention to how you used it. Where to fork the discussions, where to spilt them off into their own wave leaving only a link in their place, etc. It just doesn't work for people for whom the \"reply all\" button seems a sensible solution.... I had such hope for it though. The technical side seems pretty well solved at this point, it seems like that we need is a crack team of psychologists and UX people to have a go at the problem. reply Esras 10 hours agorootparent> ... too much careful attention to how you used it. Zulip has been mentioned a couple of times in this thread, with similar results in utilization. I like learning and exploring new tools, but if there's one thing I've learned about building them is that most people are only interested in using your tool to the barest minimum to get the result they need. See (without citation) how many software engineers you know don't \"understand\" Git beyond add / commit / push. What that means is that if you have a dedicated group of people that is interested in exploring a new tool and understanding it, then great! Those people are going to love the tool and take the time to learn it. But the demands of society / work / time limits means that most of the time, they don't want to spend that time investment. It might be a \"waste\" of time, it might not solve the right problem, other people also have to invest the time, etc. That friction is huge. That's why Slack took off at first, and then Discord blew it away in the consumer world. Discord removed those internal silos, had a lot of the same chrome on it that Slack did for IRC, and then they've continued to make certain things very easy to do within their platform (jumping into voice chats, for instance). But, if you see the newest way they've tried to have threads act as forum messages or posts, there's no consensus on how to use them effectively and I haven't seen them used much, as a result. Anyway, one day we'll get Wave again and hopefully it won't be killed before its time, for those few of us that really loved it. reply jjmarr 7 hours agorootparentTools are created to reduce the amount of time one spends on a task. The greater the ratio between benefit and effort the better a tool is. If a tool requires the \"barest minimum of effort\" to be moderately useful, it is an amazing tool because that ratio is high. A tool that requires high effort for high benefit isn't. That being said, people will voluntarily learn new features if it creates tangible benefits for them. But the learning curve can't be too steep—it has to be intuitive on top of what they already know with consistently increasing rewards. reply chrisjj 10 hours agorootparentprev> Wave was, IMHO, the UI paradigm of the future for this sort of thing.

So a node can have multiple parents. reply nathell 2 hours agoprevYes. I’ve been toying around with a similar idea and wanting to prototype it for a while, but somebody has beaten me to it. I’ll definitely keep an eye on this. One thing I’d add is specific prompting for a participant’s intent in discussion. _Why_ are you making this point? Is it to correct factual errors in someone else’s post? To convince someone to adopt your point of view? To seek better understanding of what the other person is saying? Just to show off? This is rarely stated explicitly, to a detriment in the quality of the discussion. reply kalehelmet 4 hours agoprevIsn't this just Google Docs with extra steps? reply windowshopping 14 hours agoprevDid anyone else find this post confusing?

It's very popular on new open source projects. reply solardev 10 hours agoparentIt's pretty similar to Slack in this regard, no? Except that Discord's threads have more friction and take more clicks, if I remember correctly. reply chrisjj 10 hours agoparentprevDiscord fits in perfectly to the last century. :) reply zbentley 13 hours agoprevI quite like this for the niche of \"medium to slow reply rates\" + \"larger posts\" + \"participants who are willing to thoughtfully participate in structure\" + \"participants interested in discourse\" (that is, people who want to record their fully formed thoughts in a thread, or who want to structure persuasive arguments, rather than casual conversation or sniping). In other words, ideal for dueling essayists, technical RFC documents, or professional/academic debates. I see there as being 1-2 additional tricky problems to solve for something like this (other than ironing out UX kinks in the implementation, of which there are many--e.g. visual signifiers for overlapping thread sources outside of tree mode; a tree mode that allows users to browse responses without manually expanding things; making \"conclude\" meaningful): The first is optional, but I think it would be valuable: in many contexts, discussion and collaborative writing overlap substantially--often more than they don't. It would be interesting to see how the notion of addressing/concluding threads could be tied to changes in the document. E.g. a thread for \"I'm onboard with this proposal if we alter the paragraph this is rooted at to contain X because Y\" -> \"If it gets you onboard, I'm happy to make this change, how about \" -> approval/conclusion causes the document to be updated and the thread archived. While that's technically not hard to add, the question is whether bringing in those aspects of mutation/collaborative editing would dilute the utility of the discussion layer, resulting in a shitty Google Docs/shitty Discourse combo, rather than a single-purpose Discourse-but-better application. The second problem I see isn't optional: thread topology needs to be mutable somehow. In addition to all the valid criticisms of forum/Slack/email-thread discussion formats, any significantly-sized discussion of a complex root document inevitably develops redundancies. You end up with Slack (or whatever) threads cross-linking to other threads (\"as I said over here, \"). That leads to significant confusion, and more than a few cases of people making decisions based on stale information as the cross-references get more complicated. Sure, ideally everyone would root discussions at the single most relevant point of their parent content, and new contributors would carefully browse the existing tree to ensure that their contributions were on both the freshest and most germane leaf. But that's never going to happen in practice, so a tool like CQ2 needs some way to rearrange (or embed-with-live-updating, or make rooted at multiple sources rather than one, or something...) discussion trees. I have no idea what this would look like UX-wise. The 4chan model solves the replies-that-are-relevant-to-multiple-places issue, but doesn't help with re-parenting/consolodation after the fact to make future readers' lives easier, nor does it deal with staleness issues caused by replies linking to intermediate posts on threads which changed consensus later on. Regardless, I think functionality like this (even if it were used infrequently, by curators or administrators) would make the difference between things like CQ2 being useful only for short-to-medium-lifespan discussions with small numbers of participants, and being useful for discussions that stand as long-lived artifacts on their own. reply BOOSTERHIDROGEN 7 hours agoprevWill it offer free self-hosted Docker in the future? reply fagrobot 5 hours agoprevexactly what we need. computers telling us how to talk like computers. reply anonymous_union 14 hours agoprevdid they reinvent email threading reply zbentley 13 hours agoparentIt seems like an enhancement of some parts of email threads rather than a reinvention: replies are identified by where they're rooted rather than a subject; a \"concluded\" metadata bit is present to at-a-glance delineate stale threads from completed ones; tree structure is enforced by the platform rather than the users following a plain-text convention re: top-posting and quoting; contribution, reply reading, and tree browsing all happen in a single place without involving transmission asynchrony or email clients (which mailing-list-all-the-things zealots probably do not consider an enhancement, but which history indicates most people prefer). reply adamfeldman 14 hours agoprevHow does CQ2 compare to Zulip? reply rockooooo 13 hours agoparentZulip is more of a Slack-like instant chat system with threading as a first class citizen; CQ2 looks like threads only exist in the context of one \"root\" document vs a channel in zulip where threads can intermingle. reply flemhans 12 hours agoprevMacSOUP had the best visualization of threads. reply dontdieych 14 hours agoprevThought arrow keys would work. :D reply boznz 10 hours agoprevHaving a TLDR updated in real time at the top of every complex discussion would be ideal, I hate going in to a thread where there are 30+ pages I have to wade through that can be summarized in a paragraph or two and closed once it gets off topic. reply MichaelZuo 8 hours agoprevFYI This site somehow completely breaks Firefox 68.12 ESR, it's impossible to even scroll down with the keyboard and somehow hides the always visible scroll bar too. reply micromacrofoot 12 hours agoprevI find that as soon as you introduce threads as a form of organization, you've already lost the plot with 75% of users.

Assuming a USA buyer, you'd have to ask for their zip code, then match that to the plants, many of which would probably have to be individually coded & entered (the zip codes they are native to), a map blur across the US which would vary for each species. The binary qualities (toxic/nontoxic) on the other hand seem easy to add. For invasiveness: that may be a reason why not too many \"Amazon for plants\" websites exist.

Agreed! In terms of difficulty:benefit, a binary invasive flag would get most of the way there. E.g. English Ivy, Bradford Pears, Mexican Petunia, creeping bamboo. Buuuuut... this looks like it's mostly for house plants, for which invasiveness is less of a concern. However, I think it should mostly generalize to outdoor plants as well. At least in the US, you could simply add USDA hardiness zone [0], which roughly indicates the boundaries a cultivar can survive winter (freezing) and summer (heat), and is almost always listed. I'd be shocked if there wasn't a zipcode-to-USDAH converter out there.

Every invasive species has a place where they're a perfectly nice local native. reply zamadatix 17 hours agoparentprevAnother attribute/attribute extension that would be helpful is toxicity for pets in particular. reply ryebread777 17 hours agorootparentThere is a filter on the plant list for pet-safe! Look for the paw icon. Haven’t pulled this info onto the plant detail page yet though. reply zamadatix 12 hours agorootparentI was so focused on the filter drop downs I didn't even think to look for it as a plant category! Thanks reply jihadjihad 20 hours agoprevThis is really cool, congrats on shipping. I've had a hard time finding reliable plant information as well, especially since many sites focus only on indoor plants while others focus only on those you grow outside in a garden, etc. It's nice to be able to search for plants I have inside as well as outside. Having a filter for the genus is a great idea too! The search feels a little slow, and it's somewhat finicky: if I type in \"ficus ginseng\" I don't see a result, apparently because the title is \"Ficus 'Ginseng'\" so the single quotes are needed. But I can see myself using this site! Nice work! reply ryebread777 20 hours agoparentAh, yes you are right about that. The search sucks right now. An even bigger issue is that search only matches in the scientific name but most people are entering common names. Yours is the first user feedback to mention it though so thank you for sharing! I will make it a higher priority to fix. reply voisin 19 hours agoprevI’d love if this included outdoor plants, shrubs, trees, and had a filter for hardiness zone. reply berkes 18 hours agoparentPl@ntnet does that.

Anything besides hardiness zone? Maybe categories for trees, shrubs, etc? reply lordswork 18 hours agorootparentThe regions where the plant is considered native, how aggressive it spreads (there is some metric that captures this IIRC), and regions where it is labeled as invasive. The PictureThis app shows this info, and it's incredibly useful. reply pwenzel 19 hours agorootparentprevFor outdoor plants, I would really want to know what plants are drought tolerant. Climate change is drastically altering summers in Minnesota (wildfire smoke, drought, high AQI, high temps, extreme downpours). It would also be really great to search for pollinator friendly plants (https://bluethumb.org is an excellent reference) reply ccorcos 18 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been building a permaculture garden and I want to know - usda hardiness zone - sun/shade tolerance - geographic origin - is it a nitrogen fixer - soil pH preference - wet/dry soil preference - when does it fruit?

Botanist drawings are technical, so I tend to treat illustrations in that style as factual in some sense, but AI can ape the style quite nicely while getting all the details wrong. You wouldn't want AI-generated technical documentation, would you? It's the same here. Can't you just find images, the same as you find plants? Or manually add them, or something.

Though it may have improved. Probably for common plants it would work excellent (bell pepper, monstera) but most of the plants on the site are fairly obscure, especially the ones without images. I wouldn’t want to create a misleading image. Another AI approach might be to create simple illustrations of plants I don’t have images for, using other images as reference.

California has lots of these communities for example: https://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/communities reply mtgentry 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah I’d love this too. I live in SoCal and I’m doing my yard with native plants. Some things I’m having trouble finding: 1) plants that bloom in seasons other than spring 2) plants that aren’t native but can work in my climate 3) plants that will do ok in clay soil 4) plants with a small footprint for a small yard.

Since this is not an open source project, before I bombard you with technical questions I have to ask, are you open to discuss the structure of your app? Like about your sources, images, etc? reply ryebread777 19 hours agoparentSure! Happy to answer most things as I’m looking to share but also to get feedback and new ideas on those topics. reply vidyesh 19 hours agorootparentAwesome! Feel free some or all. Few of my queries you mostly answered elsewhere in your replies about images and how you get the data. How did you determine which plants to list? Is it just a database of all the unique plants from all sources or just a general plant database? I see each plant shows price + x stores, does that mean you are archiving the prices and not scraping real time? How are you determining the time interval for that? How are you handling wrongly or typo listed plants from your sources? Since you mentioned this is using next and django, what are you using shopify for? Are you an affiliate for most of them or nothing like that so far? Sorry I don't really have any valuable feedback apart from what everyone mentioned, Search is really slow. And some or most external links have an extra / in their hyperlink, so at https://www.getanyplant.com/plant/4f5952a72087bce5e5c28a72c76c7563 https://planetdesert.com//products Thank you. reply ryebread777 18 hours agorootparentI just list all of the plants sold at any of the stores I currently integrate with. I use a scientific taxonomic name database to make sure that the binomial names (genus, species) are legit and not miss-spelled and all of my liastings are anchored to that. I match products to binomial names through a process thats that uses a really complex regex, plus some manual labeling. Experimenting with using more ML here. Price/availability data is updated on a nightly basis. Probably want to increase that frequency, though no one has complained about stale data yet, so not high priority. Getting some affiliate relationships set up right now! Already have two added in the past week. That extra / is mysterious... I will dive into that after work. reply vidyesh 16 hours agorootparentThank you so much! I am not that experienced building large scale projects so really appreciate your replies in thing post. I am quite surprised that shopify doesn't have hotlink protection for images! >I match products to binomial names through a process thats that uses a really complex regex, plus some manual labeling. Experimenting with using more ML here. Thats what I wondering. I am building something similar, region specific for books and sometimes the names are just a little off or partial or alternate names. I am currently doing a string comparison to match at least 80-90% of the words in the title, which works okay for now. So thank you for the ideas. Your product update frequency is very interesting, I always thought scraping for price aggregation meant one has to make sure its very frequently updated. My approach is a bit different, it only scrapes on search, so not really scraping all the sites. Not the best approach, but its scary to me to scrape complete websites and that much data lol I currently am not using a db either but scraping and caching for 30mins, that specific item which now I think about is a bad idea if I want to make this a scalable project. I should start using a database indeed. Some feedback on the UI/UX, instead of having 'All plants' selected on the homepage, it would be nice to instead have a smaller grid of plants from each type/tag on the home page itself. Selecting any of the tag would work the same as now but homepage will have more to explore because currently its just overwhelming to do anything on the homepage. I am just looking in specific tags or just searching. Edit: This is a great resource for adding more info about pet friendly plants to the listed plants. https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-a... reply ryebread777 15 hours agorootparentThanks for the advice! I too am surprised by that. The Django version of my site had something similar! The home page showed plants grouped into categories kind of like Netflix. But when I transitioned to react I limited the scope. But I might go back to that! One other tip - many sites have APIs that will give you their product data. You may need to contact them about getting access. Or it may be publicly available. But that is better than scraping if it is possible. reply pastor_bob 19 hours agorootparentprev>Since you mentioned this is using next and django, what are you using shopify for?

Other than that it's great!! reply contingencies 10 hours agoprevHey, also a plant lover here. I also have experienced great frustration sourcing plants and pondered a similar platform. Haven't acted on it as too busy with existing projects. Issues not dealt with in your platform: plants with no known source should be hidden by default, shipping issues such as international and interstate restrictions on mailing plant material should be recognised, time and cost should be respected including currency exchange rates, and the options of growing from seed or spore should be in-scope. If you want to grow it, my suggestion would be to use a social model, so allow people to store information about their own garden and then share a feed of events like \"I planted this!\" or \"This flowered!\" or \"This reproduced!\" or \"I collected seeds!\" to draw people to your platform. Sharing material and the use of endemic plants should be encouraged where possible, not just outright commercialism. The gold standard today for accessible all-species info at the global level is iNaturalist (pulls in nice maps plus taxonomy plus Wikipedia, though unfortunately does not really delineate in the map between nominal natural range and current range). Not sure how you do it now but frankly it would be somewhat superfluous to attempt to reproduce such information independently, for example by maintaining your own image database. Other things that can draw people to a site would include seasonally appropriate gardening tips (plant or fertilise or prune X now before Y season, check Z for A/B/C pest situation, clone P now, etc.), a relevant local events feed (which opens up potential travel revenue streams such as hotels, flights, group tours, etc.), and academic and publishing news in related areas. Many of the nurseries have problems maintaining up to date stock lists. To commercialise, it may be useful to help them do so. To motivate them to get on the platform, you could for example allow parties to sign up for future purchases of crops not yet matured but with an estimate readiness date, thereby assisting the grower with cashflow and sales pipelining. reply ryebread777 9 hours agoparentThank you for your thoughtful response! I love your ideas. I will have to come back a few times to process everything but will add a few thoughts now. Many science-oriented resources, such as iNaturalist, license content with creative commons licenses, but don't permit commercial applications. That prevents me from making use of many of them as part of my site. But in general my aim is also much different, so certainly don't see myself as competing. I want to help people actually obtain and enjoy the plants rather than just study them. I think your tip about leveraging social media is excellent! I will brainstorm content that users can share out, like you describe. Probably a good starting point is a way to share your wishlist (or current collection). Your idea about maintaining stock lists and allowing pre-purchasing of plants is really brilliant. I don't know much about the nursery space, but I will try to learn more and think about your idea and other options in the space. What you describe makes a lot of sense. I really appreciate your ideas. reply ivolimmen 20 hours agoprevI am a bit disappointed; I was expecting plants that cost a minimum of 6K...

    "title": "Extending Free Trial Boosts Conversions",
    "originLink": "https://keygen.sh/blog/your-14-day-free-trial-aint-gonna-cut-it/",
    "originBody": "Your 14-Day Free Trial Ain't Gonna Cut It Friday, May 3rd 2024 I've been working on Keygen for coming up on 8 years now (May 22nd, to be exact). In that time, it's an understatement to say that I've learned a lot. One of the things I've learned is that a lot of founders, myself included, ignore some pretty crucial business metrics. One of those metrics that we'll be talking about today is time-to-convert. When I first started Keygen, I did what everybody probably does and set up a 14-day free trial. What I quickly found is that it's very hard for a potential customer to integrate a software licensing API into their entire stack within a 14 days timeframe. So I started offering free trial extensions. I'd push this on my pricing page, in onboarding emails, in follow up emails, etc. I wanted to make potentional customers aware that they had more time. What I found over the next couple years was that the majority of converting customers had asked for a free trial extension. And out those that did and those that didn't, my conversion rate was higher when they did ask for one. Was there a reason why this was the case? Possibly! When I extended a trial, I would require the potential customer to put a card on file before I extended their trial. So we go from free trial without a card, to free trial with a card. Much better. You may be thinking — what does this have to do with time-to-convert? We'll get there. Anyways — after discovering that free trial extensions increase conversion rate, I started personally sending emails to potentional customers that were nearing their trial's end to offer a trial extension. This was a pretty big success. So much of a success, actually, that I stopped being so strict about requiring a card be put on file — mainly out of laziness — because it was such an annoying back-and-forth step to do before extending a potential customer's trial. Unintuitively to what I learned prior, this didn't hurt conversion rate (so that potential reason for a higher conversion rate was moot). I chugged along manually extending trials for a couple more years. Then I got fed up with limited metrics from Baremetrics and replaced it with a Rake task. I no longer use that Rake task (it didn't scale as my Stripe customer count grew), but through that, I learned about my time-to-convert, which is a crucial business metric that remains unknown to many, many founders (myself included at the time). What is time-to-convert? It's the time it takes from a customer signing up to a customer paying you. Pretty simple. (For brevity, I'll refer to this metric as TTC.) So why was this such a big deal? Well, because my 14-day free trial didn't line up with the time it takes a customer to realize value from Keygen — to get to that fork in the road where they can decide \"is this worth my money?\" I gave them 14 days to get to that fork. But my p50 TTC is 41 days. My p90, 130 days; p95, 198; p99, 290. If you want to calculate yours using Stripe Sigma, try this query: SELECT format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.5)) AS time_to_convert_p50, format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.9)) AS time_to_convert_p90, format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.95)) AS time_to_convert_p95, format('%d days', approx_percentile(time_to_convert, 0.99)) AS time_to_convert_p99 FROM ( SELECT DATE_DIFF('day', MIN(customers.created), MIN(charges.created)) AS time_to_convert, customers.id FROM customers INNER JOIN charges ON charges.customer_id = customers.id WHERE customers.created BETWEEN DATE_ADD('year', -1, CURRENT_DATE) AND CURRENT_DATE AND charges.paid = TRUE AND charges.amount > 0 GROUP BY customers.id ) content_copy As I mentioned, I realized that what I was really doing was asking people to sign up now and complete a proof-of-concept integration in 14 days. This includes reading documentation, onboarding, and planning and executing a proof-of-concept (PoC). But my median TTC is 41 days! That just doesn't work. Understanding and integrating a new API can be a lot. On top of other projects, it can end up being impossible to do in 14 days, from first discovery to being integrated (or at least with a PoC in-hand). What I was really asking potential customers to do was wait. Wait until they're ready to start understanding the API. Wait until they're ready to go through onboarding. Wait until the PoC is planned. Wait until dev is freed up. Wait. Wait. Wait. What ends up happening is that people get busy and they end up seeing that 14 day deadline, determine that they're not ready yet, so they bounce until they are ready, but then they never come back. I decided that I needed to remove that friction. I wanted to capture these leads as soon as they decide Keygen may be the solution for them. So ultimately, I can start nurturing these leads. So I did what every bootstrapper tells you to never do… I added an unlimited trial, a.k.a. a free tier. What happened next? Overall sign ups increased, of course, as it always does with a free tier. But by segmenting out users that stay on the free tier, I found paid sign ups also increased, with conversion rate staying steady, but now with no manual work. I say that's a win-win. So, what's your TTC? Until next time.",

My general use case is to download and test software to use it a single time, for some random new task I only need that day. To use the software for 5 minutes. Then three months later, oh it turns out I need to do that thing again, or test it out in a new way. It says the trial has expired, even though I only used it for 5 minutes. And I'm not going to pay $$$ just to use it for another 5 minutes and possibly never again. I don't understand why x-day free trials haven't been replaced with usage-based free trials. E.g. whether it's exporting a final result 20 times, or running a filter 50 times, or processing 100 input files, or whatever metric makes sense for the particular product. Or heck, keep it a 14-day free trial but count the days individually -- so if I use it on May 2 and then on May 15, that's only two days. The idea that, as a consumer, I'm going to sit down and fully evaluate a piece of software over the course of 7/14/30 consecutive days to then make a purchasing decision is bizarre. reply filmgirlcw 17 hours agoparentBut to push back, if you’re talking about a 5 minute task, that you’re using once every few months, a free trial timed the way you are asking, might mean you never end up needing to purchase a license. I understand that that is useful for you, but that isn’t exactly good for someone trying to sell a piece of software. (I understand you also gave usage based examples, but even in those scenarios (which require additional work to code for trial versions, versus a pure time-lock), there is always going to be someone who says “5 saves isn’t enough” or whatever the metric is). > The idea that, as a consumer, I'm going to sit down and fully evaluate a piece of software over the course of 7/14/30 consecutive days to then make a purchasing decision is bizarre. Maybe it’s my past life as a software reviewer (and current life as someone frequently asked about my assessment/opinion on apps), but for consumer software (SaaS, especially for business like what OP article is about, I think is different), I really don’t think this is that bizarre. To me, a trial is really instructive because if I’m finding myself opening or using an app frequently during the trial, that’s a good indicator I’ll get value out of the application. Similarly, if I did a trial in January for one task, then came back to do that same task again in May and the trial is expired, it’s a good way for me to evaluate if it makes sense for me to buy a license or not. There are some programs I use two or three times a year that I purchase because it is useful enough for that one task, but there are others that I use infrequently enough to try to seek out other options. A time-based trial, for me, is a good forcing function to determine if I’m actually going to use the program. reply kmacdough 17 hours agorootparentCounter to your counter, a person using software 5-6 times over a few years is almost never going to become a paying customer. They'll just cut you out entirely. But odds are they know similar professionals and could be a major promoter to potential power-users. Chatting with a few coworkers, none of us can come up with a single example of letting a trial expire, only to pay for isolated uses later. We had quite a few examples of software we thought might be valueable, but weren't prepared to pay having run out our trials. Three of us are in this state for Copilot alone.

You tell this story, but it seems very inconsistent with my experience or my understanding of pricing theory. I don’t know who the “you” is referring to. All I said was that in my personal experience, there have been occasions (not frequent, but it has happened) where I’ll buy a perpetual license to something for a task I use a few times a year. Because the $20 or whatever the license cost was worth the time I saved. In most cases, what I said was that if I didn’t use a piece of software after the trial expired, that was a good forcing function to figure out if it was something I find value in or not. And in most cases, the answer is going to be “I don’t need to buy this.” I’m not at all focused on what people oughta pay for so I don’t know where you are misreading this.

As a producer of the said software, if that is the user's usage pattern, and there are enough regular users to sustain/pay for these users, then I won't want to charge them. Doing so means I either lose out on potential customers or they aren't going to be a true customer anyways. reply pierrebai 15 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with this thinking is that you are creating dissatisfaction for 25 cents. Let's say, you sell your software as a single-version perpetual license. You sell it for 150$. A typical user uses it 8 hours a month. After a year, that's 96 hours. So they spend less than 2$ per hour (I'm rounding in the seller's favor.) So using it for 5 minutes, 1/12h, is less than 25 cents. (Again rounding up in the seller's favor.) Is this about not giving away 25 cents? This is where SaaS wins over, but even there, the overhead, both for sellers and users, of managing payment for people who want to do one-shot work is never going to be worth it. reply meiraleal 14 hours agorootparentThis scenario is akin to wanting an insurance payout for a stolen car after paying just the last month’s premium reply hinkley 17 hours agorootparentprevI took a job working at a company that made a code obfuscator/minimizer in the days before CI/CD really existed. I knew a lot about Java internals so I thought this would be good. First day I got assigned instead to an embedded Java project. Why? They couldn’t market the obfuscator, so they were winding it down. People didn’t want a license for something they used for ten minutes four times a year. (We did later hire an intern to fix bugs in the obfuscator. The app was constrained to a specific JAR size, and those gave us enough headroom for about another dozen features. And I made a change late in the project that got me space for two more, via suffix sorting the constant pool instead of prefix sorting it). reply tylersmith 16 hours agorootparentprev> But to push back, if you’re talking about a 5 minute task, that you’re using once every few months, a free trial timed the way you are asking, might mean you never end up needing to purchase a license. That's why they want that model. Complaints like the GP's are just a thin veil over being too cheap to pay for the software they use.

Flip that. I find most people do the second thing first. If what I'm doing in the software takes 5 minutes, chances are I can find something else out there that will do the same thing for free as well. Sometimes the same software lets you trial it again because it's been so long. And so all the additional features you'd review them for amount to nothing when I'm just using them to remove the background in my picture. But here is the bigger issue. > it’s a good way for me to evaluate if it makes sense for me to buy a license or not It's a horrible way for me to evaluate licensing. Why? Because, I probably want to get on with whatever task should only take 5 minutes and do something else. I don't want to spend time evaluating licensing and determine the cost benefits analysis of this software purchase (which more and more tends toward a monthly/yearly fee). I want to do the 5 minute thing and move on, and I will spend more time searching for another free solution than pay. You want to get me to pay you? Make that 5 minutes showcase the things I did't know I needed. And yes, if you have the only thing that can do the thing I'm looking to do, sure. But, a monopoly isn't exactly what we are talking about here. reply Aurornis 17 hours agoparentprev> The idea that, as a consumer, I'm going to sit down and fully evaluate a piece of software over the course of 7/14/30 consecutive days to then make a purchasing decision is bizarre. But that's exactly what you described yourself as doing.

The real bizarre thing is that someone can blame the software provider for giving away free use of their software, or for \"only\" allowing them to use it for 30 days for free. Honestly, I don't understand what model would actually satisfy you while also leaving a window for the software developer to get paid. If someone gave you 14 separate days to run a trial and you utilized the software on the same 3 month schedule, you'd have over 3 years to \"evaluate\" the software without paying a dime. > The idea that, as a consumer, I'm going to sit down and fully evaluate a piece of software over the course of 7/14/30 consecutive days to then make a purchasing decision is bizarre. I don't understand this complaint, either. You already used the software, saw that it solved your problems, and then knew it well enough to know that you needed it again 3 months later. What more do you want? A full year to think about it while it solves your problems? Would you prefer if the software was usable in \"trial\" mode indefinitely, but you couldn't actually output anything (save files, get non-watermarked output) until you purchased it? That's the only alternative I can think of that would help you try the software longer, but then you would be forced to pay on the very first use in your example above. That actually leaves you worse off, not better. This whole conversation reminds me of why it's so much easier to deal with B2B and Enterprise software: With cheap consumer software, you get people who will complain to the ends of the earth about your $20 software or jump through hoops to avoid paying less than the cost of a couple drinks to purchase software that clearly solves their needs. reply ericd 17 hours agorootparentThe thing is, I often get called away from whatever I was trying to do, and just don’t revisit it for a few weeks, a month. I opened the software, but never actually used it. I go back to it later, whoops, free trial expired. I think x free uses is a much better way to do it, and I as a software maker don’t really feel like I need to charge someone who only needs my stuff once or twice, the marginal cost to me is 0. If they’re getting professional value out of it, or it’s a big part of their day to day for some other reason, then I think they should pay.

But you can't make everyone happy. If someone is starting the trial and then not using the software for a week or month, that's their mistake. There was a time when nagware software was popular: You got to use it for free, but it would nag you with a popup or delay every once in a while asking you to purchase it. You can still occasionally find software with this model, but most developers quickly learned that the more leeway you give the free trial users, the less likely they are to buy it. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparent> If someone is starting the trial and then not using the software for a week or month, that's their mistake.

Yes, you can probably make more by adding more pressure than nagware did. But you’re doing it at the expense of being pro-user. I do think it’s reasonable to be less friendly than that, if it doesn’t work for you. You can probably make even more than free trials by getting people into a monthly subscription, making it harder to cancel, and/or making it so it’s easier to forget that they’re being charged, etc. There are many ways to enrich yourself at the expense of others. And many companies seem to have justified each of these to themselves. reply felipellrocha 17 hours agorootparentprevThis makes sense to me. To some people, nothing will be sufficient outside of free. The demand curve predicts this.

But they deserve the blame, because now I'm going to go download a different audio editing suite to try their noise reduction instead. And if now I keep having to do noise reduction because it's no longer a one-off thing, I'll purchase that competitor. Because the first piece of software stopped letting me try it out so I can't even compare anymore. Even though I'd only used it for 5 minutes. My whole point is that \"30 days for free\" is meaningless if I only use it for 5 minutes. It makes much more sense for trials to be usage-metered rather than contiguous calendar days. reply Dalewyn 15 hours agorootparentIf you used the program once during the trial period then came back to it again for some reason or another after the trial expired, the trial worked exactly as intended: You want to use the program again, so it's asking you to pay up. I don't see the problem here other than \"I don't want to pay for software.\" which isn't the programmer's concern. If you don't want to pay, the programmer likewise couldn't give a damn if you can't use his program. reply meiraleal 14 hours agorootparentprevThey lost nothing by you not using their free trial again tho you are the kind of user that we all try to avoid reply p_l 17 hours agoparentprevScrivener has an interesting pattern where they offer 30 day trial - but they only count the days you use the software.

Great to hear that at least one company does this. It makes perfect sense, because it matches how unpredictable people's lives can be. Just because you offer a 7 day trial and I had time today to try it out a bit, doesn't mean I'll necessarily have any time at all over the next 6 days to finish evaluating it.

After 30 days of ACTUALLY using it (days which are sometimes few and far between, and sometimes more closely spaced) is really a point at which, yes, it's justified to purchase, showing that it has been \"the tool of choice\" so many times, and likely to be so into the foreseeable near to mid future, too. The trial is critical to a) proving that it does the useful things, b) determining that that it does said specific things better than the alternatives for some relevant definition of better, and c) giving enough of a chance to really learn it well enough to make an informed decision. The free period builds tremendous goodwill, and is a really sane and \"nice to the community\" choice for a tool that might get used occasionally. It shows the confidence that the market really is there for it in general. People who can/do reap value from it on an ongoing basis will convert. reply citruscomputing 13 hours agorootparentprevMp3tag for Mac (https://mp3tag.app/) does the same - great piece of software, I've used it 6 times and have one day of trial left :) reply tppiotrowski 17 hours agorootparentprevI think most consumers would agree that this is the fairest model.

As someone else said, Scrivener offers this. I downloaded it and wanted to give it a try, but I was always hesitant to fire it up. I always felt that if I did use it and realized five minutes in that today wasn't the day I was going to write a lot, then I had wasted one of my 30 days.

But they charge a lot more for that plan. For example, $89.99 for month-to-month vs $59.99 for monthly payments toward an annual plan. Still, it’s the cheaper and better option if you’re only using it for a few months of the year. reply Spooky23 17 hours agorootparentprevAdobe requires annual commit and true up!

So our team has to implement obnoxious processes to validate your use, or pay 15-25% more than we need to. reply jkaplowitz 15 hours agorootparentWhat you say is probably true for their enterprise deals, but most of their retail plans do offer true month-to-month options for less than double the monthly price of the annual commitment.

You personally might not come back but the next customer might. Yes, exactly. The parent comment says they are not going to pay to use it for another 5 minutes. So if it were usage-based, would they pay to use it for the 21st times, after they run out the 20 free uses? And they only use it once per three months. So the 21st use is 5 years later. Will the software still be maintined by the time? Will the dev still exist? Will the problem itself still exist? reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparentI would pay for it by the 21st time. That was my point. If I'm using something for only the 2nd time, then statistically it's very unknown whether I'll ever use a 3rd time. If I paid for it now, there's a good chance I'd be throwing away my money. Whereas if I've used something 20 times, then it's extremely likely I'll be using it another 20, 50, 100, or 1,000 times. It's clearly worth paying for after 20 times. reply Aurornis 17 hours agorootparent> I would pay for it by the 21st time. In your example above (needing it every 3 months) it would take over 5 years to reach that point. I'm going to guess that within those 5 years it's likely that the developer would have released a new major release (with a new trial period), or that you would have reinstalled your OS (resetting the trial timer), or that you would have gotten a new computer... In other words, you'd never pay for the software. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparent> In your example above (needing it every 3 months) it would take over 5 years to reach that point. That wasn't my example. It was 3 months between the first and second times. In my experience, your need for a tool often increases gradually. You have a one-off project that needs a tool briefly, then a couple of projects a few months later you need to try it more, then it becomes a regular thing. It's pretty rare that I go from never needing a tool to needing it constantly as an instant switch.

Dunno, not OP. > I would pay for it *by* the 21st time. By the 21st time != the 21st time. By the 21st time == at some point prior to the 21st time. Possibly the 5th or 6th time. Maybe the 10th time. Maybe the 3rd time. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentprev> You personally might not come back but the next customer might. Then that's a terrible business model. As a business, you want both customers to come back. If a contiguous time-based trial model results in losing half your potential customers, while a usage-based trial model results in keeping all potential customers, then the contiguous time-based trial is objectively terrible. So it doesn't demonstrate the usefulness at all. reply TheGRS 16 hours agorootparentI'm also assuming OP didn't really intend to pay if they're coming to a tool that they'll use for 5 minutes. They don't see the value in paying, I'm just reading between the lines there. Maybe its still better to let them get a long free trial so they tell their friends about it, I dunno. Not a marketer, but it struck me as kind of disingenuous that if you came back to a tool after 3 months where you know you need to use it, they still don't want to pay. reply elevatedastalt 10 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I don't want a customer like OP back. They come across as extremely entitled and the whole post seems to condense down to \"I don't want to pay for software, give it to me for free\". reply kelnos 16 hours agoparentprevSo essentially what you're advocating for is a model where some percentage of users can use the software in some limited way, for free, possibly over the span of many months or even years, and the person who built it sees no revenue from that use at all? Sure, as the article describes, that's an unlimited-time free tier. But maybe the developer doesn't want to offer a free tier. > The idea that, as a consumer, I'm going to sit down and fully evaluate a piece of software over the course of 7/14/30 consecutive days to then make a purchasing decision is bizarre. Except you did do that, in your example. You evaluated it over the span of 5 minutes (you didn't even need days or weeks), and then were apparently satisfied enough with it that you remembered it and came back to it months later to use it again. And then you balk at the idea that you should have to pay for something that you already know you get value out of.

Unfortunately such a payment scheme is not practical under current Visa/Mastercard system. reply Yeroc 14 hours agorootparentSadly, the only micropayments implementation we have is ad-supported apps. It's essentially micropayments.

But everything wants like $20-30, or even worse, to lock me into some monthly subscription. reply kulahan 15 hours agorootparentThat level of effort is something I think matters a lot. If you could make it incredibly easy for people to spend $1-2 (and no more), you could get a TON of money out of people. I dunno how you'd solve that major structural issue, but if you could, it sounds like a goldmine. If nothing else, microtransactions in software would probably explode more than they already have. reply ska 14 hours agorootparentprevI think hypothetical/magic micropayments that just work(TM) actually solve lots of problems. The problem is with the “realistic” part, which is why it always comes up. reply zamadatix 17 hours agoparentprevOn the flip side (for the company, not the consumer) if you've come back to the tool 3 months later you're already mentally invested in learning the tool, know it works, and remembered it. Either that'll be a paying customer or it won't, giving them 100 input files doesn't really guarantee a sale 7 years from now (or whenever it is they run out). I.e. too short to actually be able to try it is a problem. How long \"too short\" is varies a lot based on what it is you're selling. Too short to be able to try multiple times may actually be a positive for total sales though, particularly in the consumer software space. As always the answer is \"test and see what changes your sales\" but that not much does it this way is more likely a hint it doesn't execute well with most models rather than nobody is trying it. reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparent> you're already mentally invested in learning the tool, know it works, and remembered it. Not really. In my experience, I learned only a tiny percentage of the tool -- like how to run a noise reduction filter and nothing else. I know that one thing worked the one time for that one file, but not for other files with different types of noise. And I didn't even remember it -- I googled \"noise reduction software\" again, discovered the top link was purple, and only then remembered I'd already installed it on my system and forgotten its name. I started it up and it says I can't use it anymore because the trial expired. I might have a whole bunch of clips I need to noise reduce now, maybe it's going to become a regular thing at this point, but I can only test with competitors' software now... reply neilv 16 hours agoparentprevIIUC, the user evaluated it sufficiently for that task, such that they wanted to use it repeatedly for that task, but the software can do a lot more things, and they don't want to pay the price for just that one feature they evaluated so far, before they evaluate the other features? If we're selling consumer software, and our expectation is that people might use it only rarely, and only need a fraction of the features, but get value out of it when they do... can we do free trials without this perception? Don't do free trials? Cripple the trial so that user can see what it can do, but user can't get the benefit they want? Break a big package/suite into many small tools sold separately, to avoid the perception of paying for more than you need or can evaluate? Pay per metered use? Renewable subscription tiers? reply XCSme 17 hours agoparentprevWell, I sell a website analytics platform, so 14 days are needed for you to gather data and get meaningful insights. Even if you forget about it, and come later, you can still see the data and test the features. Also, the app is self-hosted, so part of the trial benefit is that users can test the installation process, which is usually the biggest push-back against self-hosting. reply unilynx 17 hours agorootparentWould it be possible to always offer the last 14 days of stats, but only allow a login/access to that data eg 3 or 7 times ? I wonder if that might fit the average pattern of a casual stats user a bit better (only actually checking the data when asked by the manager) to keep them hooked for a much longer 'wall clock' time and get them to eventually convert (I've been depending on this for half a year now) reply XCSme 16 hours agorootparentThat's a good idea and, in theory, I could implement a lot of different models. In practice, because it's self-hosted, \"cracking\" might be an issue. Customers might edit the files that affect the retention, for example. Maybe most customers won't do it, but I don't know. This also feels a bit like I would have to implement some \"DRM\", which I really don't want. Now that you mentioned it, maybe a better trial would be a freemium model, where I can serve a different version for free that only has some features. The problem with this, is that the customer won't get all the benefits of using the product, so they might not like it enough to upgrade to the full version. It's an analytics platform, so I could offer just basic stats for free and for premium all the other features (segments, heatmaps, recordings, A/B tests, AI integration, etc.). This could work as a good marketing technique for the top of the funnel, but then customers would still probably want to trial the pro features, so I am stuck with the same problem as before. reply ericd 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah, freemium with a free tier that’s useful for casual use converts me way more often than time-based trials. reply XCSme 16 hours agorootparentHmm, but what would make you upgrade from the free tier to premium? Because you still can't try the premium features. Wouldn't I still need to provide a trial for the premium features, for you to decide whether they are worth upgrading? reply ericd 5 hours agorootparentUsually if you think hard, you can find something that a casual user could progress to wanting more of. Or you can do what a lot of companies do and start everyone on a free trial of premium, and then fall back to free. Or the evil route, and make them opt out of premium to downgrade, or it bills them by default. (May they get chargebacked to hell and dropped by their payment processor) reply jahewson 17 hours agoparentprevOne reason not to do that is the sales and marketing lead time. Every time marketing changes something there’s a 2 week lag before they can measure the conversion impact. With your usage-based trial concept that lag time becomes indefinite. reply wouldbecouldbe 17 hours agoparentprevIt's not bizarre, it's a common pattern that people understand and easy to implement. Most people will accept it for that reason even if it's not ideal. I have a lower tier that users can move to which is an effective filter to see who really wants to move forward, since our set up & initial support costs are relatively high also on trials. So that works well, even if we make a loss on smaller tiers it's a sign of commitment. reply actuallyalys 17 hours agoparentprevI think I have seen this model before, in the days of shareware. Offhand, I don’t remember the name of the tool. A downside of this is that if you don’t choose the right metric, people might burn through a lot of their uses due to mistakes. Like, to use your input files example, imagine someone accidentally selects a huge directory with more than 100 files and then end up with no free uses left. Some of this also comes down to overall UX design too, of course. reply Spooky23 17 hours agoparentprevIt’s an annoying arguably dark pattern and easy to game. Buying behavior is a psychological concept driven by time and attention. A persons mental wallet is open for a limited period of time. The goal of the trial is a conversion to sale. The scenarios you describe are edge case-ish, and often times companies will accommodate them as edge cases. reply ghnws 17 hours agoparentprevDepending on the product, your trial may cost the company a decent amount of money. For example audiobooks are rather expensive to stream (due to publisher pricing, not bandwidth). reply j-cheong 13 hours agoparentprev>I don't understand why x-day free trials haven't been replaced with usage-based free trials. Hmm I would say usage-based free trials are problematic because a small company might only use it 10 times but an enterprise might need to run 10k files to fully trial the product. So what usage level would you set it at? If you go too high the small companies can be on a free trial for years, effectively a freemium model. reply groestl 18 hours agoparentprevBrowser games, they've nailed it.

Often it's an investment in your life to free up time. You can always get and earn more money, but it's impossible to add more time to your life.

A time-based trial records the date you started to use it somewhere. A usage-based trial records the number of times you've done something somewhere.

Are you happy to share a link to yours? reply martincmartin 19 hours agorootparentIf you click on their username, it takes you to their profile. https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonsarris which says: I make GoJS, a powerful canvas-based diagramming library: http://gojs.net/ Which is not what I think of a graphing (time series, x-y points joined by lines), but otherwise seems relevant to their comment. reply simonsarris 19 hours agorootparentThank you. I guess I should update that, since GoJS renders to SVG also if that's what you prefer (at a cost to performance of course) Most of us who make such libraries tend to distinguish charting (time series, lines, bars) from graphing (nodes and links). Charting is, in many aspects, a much smaller problem space. Graphing requires a lot more in terms of layouts and interaction tools, grid snapping, guides, undo/redo, copy/paste, grouping, subgraphs, managing user permissions for interactivity, expand/collapse (both subgraphs and tree sections), updating the backing data when the graph is edited, etc. reply newswasboring 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's very surprising to me that there is a market for this. But then again I have spent almost my entire professional programming career writing matlab. How does one even identify such a market? I am so curious, please share your story. reply simonsarris 19 hours agorootparentThe extremely condensed story of my company (started ~1995 when I was a tiny child, I joined 2010, though now I am part owner) was a bunch of guys in an advanced research division of Digital, trying to make a visual programming language. After Digital went under they kept trying to do this, but no one wanted the language. People however were interested in the graphic tech used to make the language, so they turned that into a library, in the 1990s, called Go++ (Graph Objects for C++). Then JGo (Java), GoDiagram (C#, WinForms and now Avalonia), GoXam (XAML/WPF C#), and GoJS. I began GoJS as a greenfield project starting in 2010-2011 as a new grad by working with these guys who had been thinking about diagrams for years. So it had the advantage of being built from scratch (and using the brand new HTML Canvas surface) but with all the accumulated experience of their wisdom at hand any time there were design questions. In some sense I got really lucky to work on such a \"brand new, but charted path\" project. Not many new grads get that kind of experience... When we released GoJS I was unsure if anyone would actually pay for JavaScript library. There weren't too many I could find in the space that weren't free (Sencha was one I found while doing research, and funny enough they tried to recruit me, flew me out to CA after I wrote a book about canvas circa 2013). But the problem space really truly is large, and you can save a year or more of development time by buying such a library, so the calculus is very worth it for many companies. Like so many people, what we sell is time, and having thought hard about these problems for so long, from layouts to really mundane undo/redo transactional stuff. reply neeleshs 18 hours agorootparentThis is very true in my experience as well. This is a key component for any good low/no code platform, process builders, workflow builders , process documentation and so on. And that is just one area. It makes tons of sense to buy/use a library like this rather than build your own (unless that is your business). We use one from antd. Antiquated and hard to automate testing. We are looking for a more modern solution. How compatible is GoJS with web testing tools? Most seem to have trouble with canvas. reply simonsarris 18 hours agorootparentI would say \"fairly annoying\", alas! I never bothered to make Selenium etc examples, though I know some customers use it. You can switch to the SVG renderer for testing if you really want to inspect the DOM after doing actions, and some customers do this too. And you can mock events if you want to, we give some basic examples: https://gojs.net/latest/samples/Robot.html But you have to inspect programmatically one way or another. What is easiest really depends on what, exactly, you want to test. Eg testing your permissions (can a user copy a node with these checkboxes in my app selected) can be done by trying to copy and seeing how many Parts exist before and after, etc. reply neeleshs 10 hours agorootparentThank you! reply recursivecaveat 14 hours agorootparentprevCan I ask how large your library can scale to? We have digraphs in the range of tens to hundreds of thousands of nodes, and every tool I've tried falls over. The layered digraph example from your site seems to hang forever at 10k, but that could just be how the example widget is set up. reply cess11 18 hours agorootparentprevYou can make it a business to build and license a JavaScript calendar widget. Many companies would rather buy such a library than have their developers pick something FOSS or develop on their own. reply PaulHoule 19 hours agoprevAs a software dev I can say this is so true. A 14-day free trial is not free, it costs your time. It takes a serious block of time to evaluate any product or service, maybe a few days. If I put a few days into an open source product and I like it I can just use it. If it is a paid product I'm going to have to go to my management, it might be easy or it might be hard, but I have to discount the gains from \"I found a product I like\" by the probability that \"we won't buy it anyway\" so that makes me all the more hesitant to complete a trial. reply garciasn 19 hours agoparentMy team is responsible for the research, evaluation, approval, integration, and on-going support for each and every single platform that is within our stack. We have a lengthy standardized process for evaluation/scoring/approval and one of our mandates is a minimum of 30 days, no payment, and no Sharewaresque limitation in functionality. If we cannot get 30 days, it's a simple 'no,' and we move on to the next. Even at 30 days, it's extremely stressful on the team to get the system up and running, ingest our test case data, and run our tests. This is after going through this process >100 times. There's simply no way to get everything that needs to be done with an evaluation of even basic coverage in less than 30. Full stop. Lack of adequate understanding of the potential challenges an org is going to face during implementation and use is, IMO, the single biggest reason implementations run WAY OVER budget, time, and eventually fail at integration w/the rest of the org.

If what your team is doing is valuable they should get any tools they like without much questions. Just like in any reasonable workplace. Because workers produce more and better when they have better tools. You can also just buy the software to evaluate it. This way you have unlimited time to see if it fits or not. That's what people do in other industries. reply dijit 18 hours agorootparentTheres a quick fall-off. Sourcegraph is $99/u/m and has major network effects. For a moderately sized org this is quickly an entire developer salary. Snyk is similarly priced, unfortunately “just buy” is a really easy way to: a) pay more than something is woth b) have multiple products doing the same thing. (for example, I have Miro and figjam and Mural in my company because each do something slightly better and teams have chosen the tools that work best). That means we often double pay on licenses for ostensibly similar software. reply sqs 18 hours agorootparentSourcegraph CEO here. It’s not $99/user/month anymore. It’s great that a lot of companies were willing to pay that, but we and our customers prefer a lower per-user price and a higher % of devs at the company using it (ideally 100%). We reduced prices for our customers (current and future). You can see the posted pricing at https://sourcegraph.com/pricing. For any other dev tools companies, I’d strongly recommend having lower prices so that every dev at your customer can use it (if that’s relevant for your product). If you start seeing customers be really picky with who gets a license, it’s probably priced too high. reply CamelCaseName 16 hours agorootparentOff-topic, but I see you always responding very quickly whenever Sourcegraph is mentioned.

Things that lock you in, especially between your released software and hosted services -- like authentication, installers/auto-update, and licensing (keygen) -- are even higher than that. It's just really hard to \"undo\" these things, both technically and because of the optics (user experience). Requiring your users to re-license their software is friction -- it burns user trust and costs a lot of time in support. 14 days is just too short to evaluate if the product will even meet your needs, let alone evaluate how much lock-in there is and what the path away could look like. reply dredmorbius 12 hours agoparentprevFrom the ops side my situation's similar. The more so as the team is often small (one-person ops teams are probably the norm, at least by number of establishments), and workload is often already overwhelming. New technology and/or products always come with unanticipated consequences and downsides. Expecting to make a decision on a major, or even minor tool isn't something that can be rushed. One model I'd noted as innovative at the time was for a SAAS company to offer a free tier of service, in the case in mind, with limited data retention of a monitoring tool. That struck me as an exceedingly good way to balance the power of the tool (all other features were otherwise available), whilst also providing a clear and reasonable upgrade path to a paid subscription. When that company IPO'd and revealed its CoS (cost of sales), I was surprised to see how high it remained (on the order of 40--50% of revenues). Selling (and buying) complex information goods is hard, whether that's software, services, consulting, news, or anything else. There's a copious literature on the production side addressing the zero marginal cost / high fixed costs predicament. There's less on the buy side, though Akerlof's \"Market for Lemons\" addresses this in part. Reducing uncertainty, increasing knowledge, and mitigating purchaser risk without needlessly offsetting revenues seem key to the issue. reply dylan604 19 hours agoparentprevIn my experience, I've only looked at new software when the text on the box says that it'll solve an issue we currently have, dramatically improve existing workflows, or specifically asked by someone else. If you're concerned about time, then maybe you (or your company) are doing it wrong. Depending on the size of your company, there should be a team of people assigned time to specifically evaluate theNewShiny whatever. If the product does not do what is advertised on the tin, then drop it and move on. If it does work as advertised, the team then evaluates next steps in how to utilize it. In this way, that research is already \"budgeted\" into employee's time. reply dangus 18 hours agoparentprevImplementers failing to prioritize doing some legwork during the free trial period also costs time for the sales organization of the selling party. From the sales side, if we see the prospect the finding a solution is a low enough priority that their engineers can’t spend time in two weeks to simply look at a solution, then they might not be an ideal fit for the product (they don’t enough business pain, don’t have a champion, and/or don’t have an economic buyer to prioritize the purchase of a solution). This is of course highly dependent on the nature of the software and the ideal customer profile of that solution, but the fact that there’s two sides of this coin is something to keep in mind. reply barfbagginus 16 hours agorootparentIn many orgs, pain points are subtle, product evaluations happen on the back burner, and internal consensus on pulling the trigger might take months. These firms are left on the table by a demo/sales process that can only afford them two weeks. And a trial need not take many sales resources. We can automate that with a demo download and self serve documentation. If it's an on prem demo, a 2 week or 12 week trial costs us the same - it's just a sign up and download. We don't actually need a sales rep to prod them about buying - the demo countdown does that, for people actually gaining value from the demo. Let's acknowledge the article's evidence that longer trials can convert customers with lower pain points. Secure customers like to evaluate things without pressure. And they might be the majority of customers. Let's enable this by building sales resilience, engineering the infrastructure painlessly delivery a longer trial that takes near zero sales or production effort. reply tomjen3 19 hours agoparentprevSounds like you need a first filter, and then only do your evaluation process on a given product if it solves a major pain point and even in that case, just evaluate the best/most common product in that category and only if it clearly doesn't work test another product.

Here's what I want from you (re: sign-ups): 1. Show me your price, with multiple pricing tiers. The more tiers you have, the more likely I am going to pick one of them, because I will think \"well this lower tier is quite the deal compared to the higher tiers!\". If I am an Enterprise customer, I will disregard you as an option if I can't see a price. Don't even show me the tier at all if you aren't going to show me your price. I get immediately incensed when I see that \"Contact us for pricing!\" bullshit, because I know how much bullshit I am in for if I just want to get a quote, so I look for somebody else. I want to use your product right now. But I'm not going to use it if I think it will be painful to work with your company, or that you might have exorbitant pricing, or you're just looking for whales. Don't make me discount you. 2. Let me use your product, immediately. Let me run it from my laptop immediately. Let me spin up a PoC. Show me your complete reference docs immediately. Show me a toy implementation w/source. I want to know if this will [eventually] give me what I want, within 15 minutes. Do that and you will already have gone above and beyond 95% of SaaS (in my mind). 3. Let me have gradient pricing. Let me sign up right away and start using your product for $0, for 5 users. Send me an e-mail when I have 7 users, informing me that I have 30 days to either reduce the number of users to 5, or it will automatically upgrade my account and charge me more (or make me confirm, or whatever). Same for the next tier, etc. (or 'pre-purchase' discounts vs 'on-demand' overage cost, etc) This gives me flexibility: I know our workflows won't just stop working when we hit a limit, and I can acquiesce to the new price or clean up old users. 4. Let me start using your product without a card on file. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right corporate person with the right corp card (if they even let me use a corp card, rather than invoicing). If you really need a card, give me 15-30 days, and then pause my account if you have to. The point is to let me get \"hooked\" on your product without needing to figure out which card to use first. (It goes without saying that when the card expires or a charge doesn't go through, give me 30 days to resolve it, because usually the corp card has hit its limit) reply nlh 14 hours agoparentSo it's interesting. Everything you ask for here is something I, personally, as an independent wanna-get-my-hands-dirty nerd, would ask for too. I totally get where you're coming from. But the thing is - the reason large companies often don't give folks like you and me these things is becuase there are proven reasons to do the contrary that actually end up making them more money. It sucks, but it's reality. 1. \"Call us\" pricing works because for big enterprise deals (4-7+ figures), there's often some serious negotiation involved and if you just show a sticker price up front, you risk a) scaring the buyer because the price is too high, b) losing the buyer because your competitor will just negotiate a better price than your listed price or b) leave yourself no room to negotiate if you really put your best price on the website. 2. Offering immediate free trials where you can jump in right away is the ideal world for nerds -- again, I love it personally. But software is often complex, and a guided demo/implementation is often the best path to make sure your buyers are actually successful. Otherwise you risk a lot of folks who sign up, jump in, have no idea what they're doing, and then abandon the trial immediately and go to a competitor who held their hand. 3. \"Let me sign up right away and start using your product for $0...\" If only offering Freemium were so simple. You will immediately have to deal with porn (it's always porn - and often kiddie porn. These people will figure out incredibly creative ways to use your SaaS product to host illegal content one way or another), spam, fraud, customer service issues, etc. There are many valid reasons to offer Freemium. There are many valid reasons not to do so. It's just not so simple. 4. Again, think about the flip side here. Lower friction to sign-ups without a card, but SO much hassle when it comes time to pay -- now you have to nag, bug, etc. to get payment, and then you have to delete accounts that are dormant.

To add to your point, the worst and most regrettable software product my company uses would have been immediately exposed as non-viable had I been allowed to get my hands dirty and run a couple of test cases. As it was, the sales-person \"yada-yada'd\" my technical questions (more fool me, yes, but I didn't know enough about their internals - the primary cause of our discontent stems from a truly stupid database-design decision) and so I lacked the context to make an informed decision. (I'm more experienced and more suspicious now; I don't think I'd make the same mistake again.) You can add borderline-fraudulent sales practice and avoiding discovery of truly bad products to the list. reply ShakataGaNai 12 hours agorootparentprev> 1. \"Call us\" pricing works because for big enterprise deals (4-7+ figures), there's often some serious negotiation involved and if you just show a sticker price up front, you risk a) scaring the buyer because the price is too high, b) losing the buyer because your competitor will just negotiate a better price than your listed price or b) leave yourself no room to negotiate if you really put your best price on the website. I'd disagree and say this can go either way. As an enterprise buyer I know both MY budget and that all numbers are negotiable - to some extent. If you show me that this product costs $100k and my budget is $80k, I'll still talk to you. But if you list $100k and all I've got is $25k for the budget, yes, I'm going elsewhere. Now you might argue \"We can make something work\" I'm concerned. You'll do 80% off deal? Clearly you don't think your product is worth what you list so... now I don't think so either. And the \"But We've got a tier for that\" then list it. My time is way valuable to me. I do not want to go through 3 screening calls, a shit ton of hoops, and a 2 week wait... just to find out that your product is way too expensive for my budget. Especially when getting into those sales calls where the reps wanna play coy and say \"Well whats your budget\" or \"Well it really depends, we want to get into a POC bla bla bla to understand your useless before providing a pricing\". Ain't no one got time for that shit. Give me the MSRP up front (with the understanding that a deal may be reachable if it's a little much) or I'm walking. Keep in mind that when I'm pricing your product I'm probably pricing 3 to 5 others. There is literally not enough hours left in my life to give each and every vendor a 5 hours of time in order to get a price. Fortunately the world is shifting. You know who's pricing is available on their website? Salesforce. Okta. OneLogin. Ping. Slack. Github. Gitlab. AWS. Google. Microsoft (for some). Elastic. Tailscale. Adobe. Databricks. Datadog. Cloudflare. Zoom. ... The list goes on. In other words there are a lot of companies out there with their prices available on their website right this second. Sure, almost everyone of them has a \"Enterprise call us for pricing\" option and that's fine, as long as you've got something for me to start with. If you're a software vendor and don't have some prices to start with, you're at a major disadvantage. Because your competitors often do. And price is not the only thing buyers are looking for. If it was, Okta would have no business. You can look at their prices and OneLogin and Ping's (and Azure AD and Google). The entire IAM/SSO space has their prices right out front and Okta is... the most expensive. Yet somehow they all still are selling. reply ang_cire 19 hours agoprevIt seems obvious that the conversion rate was higher among people who wanted extensions, because the people who don't are the ones who already decided not to use it; rarely are people going to turn down more free time to use something and rush to ask to be allowed to pay for it (though it does happen- I've been part of procurements that were being rushed to use an existing FY budget, for instance). Another thing you need to work out, imo, is what level of *feature use* in your application best maps to conversions, and from there, how can you improve the likelihood of people seeing the benefits of that feature use. As an example, my current company's app can be used with or without agent deployments, and we saw that trials that deployed agents- even just one-off ones in lab envs- converted at a far higher rate than non-agent trials. So we worked to lower the perceived barrier of entry that agent deployments posed, which meant more people seeing the increased usefulness they provided, which meant more conversions. reply ezekg 7 hours agoparentI think you misunderstood, or maybe I wasn't clear in my post. This wasn't an experiment on 2 separate groups; this was an experiment on the same group: those that convert from trial to paid. When I did X, conversion rate for the entire group increased, i.e. I made more money. If I stopped X, I'd make less money. That then lead me to the point of the post -- the % difference in conversion rate were the people who weren't actually ready but signed up for a trial anyways, only to run out of time and never come back. reply Sharlin 19 hours agoparentprev> It seems obvious that the conversion rate was higher among people who wanted extensions, because the people who don't are the ones who already decided not to use it Yeah, exactly!

I worked on it heavily for a few days, but then got busy with other things, and now that 30 day trial or whatever is coming up to an end, but I still don't feel like I've had a chance to decide if it works for me, because I haven't been actively using it that long yet still. I do plan to go back to it, just maybe not for another week or two. But if it only counted the days I opened the application, I'd still have like 26 'days' left to evaluate them (they might, I haven't checked), and it'd be no big deal, and I wouldn't have to feel all stressed out because I'm 'wasting' the demo time by actually having a life and maybe badly timing when to trigger the trial period. reply bombcar 18 hours agorootparentThis has happened time and time again with B2B systems - I sign up for a trial, begin poking it, and then work happens and by the time I go back the trial is dead. reply kevincox 19 hours agoparentprevThis is what I am doing (business to consumer) and I am quite happy with it. I am maybe a bit too generous with the free credits (many people can use the service lightly for over a year on the trial) but I like that they get the exact experience as if they were paying and they can pause and resume their trial with no extra complexity on my end.

It's basically the equivalent of a return window, without collecting money upfront. Where they don't make sense is for subscriptions, because subscriptions are by definition something your users will be using for a long time, and it might take them a while to realize all of its value and get hooked. For this stuff a free tier that funnels customers to the paid tiers usually works best.

I'd rather have a free, community-supported version and a premium version with official support. Or a basic version with free, unlimited access to only the most basic features, and a pro version with more advanced features at a cost.

So ended my WoW journey. It would have made more sense to start the trial from the first login/entering character creation. I like the Path of Exile model.

Some of the optimization solvers are annoying that way if you're trying to get a proof of concept together to get management buy-in, but it'll take a lot of development to get there. You can use one of the generic libraries that abstracts away the solver (where you can plug most vendors in) and start with an open source option, but it's an annoying approach if I think there's a strong chance we'll end up with a particular vendor as I'd want to use their native API and avoid the additional abstraction layer. I totally understand why it makes sense to the business, it's just hard to work it in to my schedule. Another thing for these companies to think about is a potential customer is investing their own time in learning your product. They may not act on it right away, but I've been in situations where we had an \"oh crap\" moment and I was able to say go get product X, I know it works on our data sets and already have example scripts for how we can use it and the vendor indicated a price of Y last year which is like 1/5 the cost this other vendor just quoted you to start implementing this from scratch.

It provides clients with the required amount of time to get up and running while also time boxing them and applying some pressure on them to commit. An unlimited free trial falls into the same trap of customers leaving until they're \"ready\" to integrate, time boxing it sort of forces them to commit to the integration at some point. reply mason55 19 hours agoparentI could certainly be abnormal, but I'm much more likely to sign up for something that has a real free tier. There's honestly very little difference to me between 60-day free trial and just having to pay from the start, I know that once I do the work to integrate then I'm committing to having to pay. At least for a startup with little revenue and little cash, 60 days is just too soon to commit to having to pay, unless it's like $10/mo. What's worked better for me is the \"startup scholarship\" that a lot of companies are doing now. A year is far enough away that we'll either be out of business or have the cash to pay, and I don't need to worry that I'm getting my money's worth by the time the 60-day trial ends. I'm a big fan of Posthog right now because they have both a generous free tier & a generous startup scholarship. I've moved a ton of stuff to their platform. A lot of it probably depends on your product though. If you're solving a very targeted problem then you might not be able to create a reasonable free tier. But a lot of B2B tech stuff is like... sure you can charge a bunch of users $5 apiece, but you risk missing the signup of the one user that was going to pay you $10k. Anything with usage-based pricing is going to have Pareto distributed revenue and you need to do everything you can to make sure you're capturing those customers on the tail. reply ezekg 18 hours agorootparent> There's honestly very little difference to me between 60-day free trial and just having to pay from the start, I know that once I do the work to integrate then I'm committing to having to pay. Yep. That's the problem with timed free trials.

Not mentioned in the post, but I have a limited unlimited free trial. Taking into account the usage limits, it's not useful for a production deployment so it applies pressure once integrated. That way I only apply pressure to those that actually integrated. If I were to do a timed trial again, it'd apply pressure to evaluate and plan the integration right now, and the product may not even be at the stage where they're ready to do that yet i.e. still in dev.

The trial length is simply a proxy for how long it takes the prospect to actually have the meeting to make the decision. By making it 41 days instead of 14, prospects will sign up and then wait 35 days before logging in a second time to -maybe- trial it. I'll get to that later. That said, any-day trials ain't gonna cut it. It's not about the number of days, it's that a trial is offered at all. Software customers these days (especially B2Bs) have an internal list of hurdles that prevent them from signing up at all. Methodically remove each hurdle, and at the end there is nothing left to do but buy, or ghost. A trial is a hurdle to be jumped. I would bet that the number of paying customers who actually -trialed the software- is 20%. Why? It takes time, effort, resources to set things up in order to trial them. To spend those resources means the purchase already needs to be approved. TLDR saying that you offer a trial at all, for any length of time, is objection handling, not conversion optimization. I'd bet you could say you offer a 3 day trial and see zero change to the funnel %s.

Affinity also had issues importing my CS6 Illustrator files, IIRC, and since I have hundreds of those for various board game designs of mine that I still go back to and rework when I have a new idea for them, the fact that it couldn't play nice with them made it pretty much a nonstarter. It's been a while since I've used Inkscape, but I remember it feeling clunky and buggy for me, and I had difficulty getting into the workflow. I'm sure I could probably force myself to get used to, and probably enjoy alternatives, but the more I invest in these proprietary alternatives, the harder it will be to shift anything back to Illustrator if I need to, especially since I don't think any of them bother to output to a CS6 friendly file format anymore, so I can shift to them, but I can't easily shift out of them. And at this point Illustrator CS6 is just dead simple for me, I don't have to think about where anything is, I know exactly what I need to do for like 98% of what I want to do on it, and most of it is muscle memory, I can whip up some cards in a few hours while watching TV shows in the background. It's going to take something significant (like it no longer working) to motivate me enough to upgrade.

    "originBody": "TunnelVision (CVE-2024-3661): How Attackers Can Decloak Routing-Based VPNs For a Total VPN Leak Network Security May 6 Written By Cody Martin Recently, we identified a novel network technique that bypasses VPN encapsulation. An attacker can use this technique to force a target user’s traffic off their VPN tunnel using built-in features of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). The result of this is the user transmits packets that are never encrypted by a VPN, and an attacker can snoop their traffic. We are using the term decloaking to refer to this effect. Importantly, the VPN control channel is maintained so features such as kill switches are never tripped, and users continue to show as connected to a VPN in all the cases we’ve observed. We’ve spent extensive time exploring this capability and attempting to notify as many affected parties as possible. We also know it is our responsibility as security researchers to inform the security and privacy community, as well as the general public, about this threat. We also believe this technique may have been possible as far back as 2002 and could have already been discovered* and potentially used in the wild. For that reason, we believe it is critical for us to disclose publicly because notifying every VPN provider, operating system maintainer, self-hosted VPN admin, and VPN user is far beyond the capacity of our small research team. We've seen one mitigation for this technique, as well as identified a fix that exists on Linux-based operating systems. However, the mitigation offers a side channel that could be used for targeted denial-of-service censorship, as well as to de-anonymize the destination of traffic via traffic analysis. In some places in the world, the side-channel alone could lead to imprisonment or death for those who rely on VPNs for safety such as journalists or whistleblowers who are common targets of surveillance or spyware. It is not feasible to fix the issue by simply removing support for the DHCP feature because this could break Internet connectivity in some legitimate cases. The strongest recommendation we have is for VPN providers to implement network namespaces on operating systems that support them, similar to the method described in WireGuard’s documentation. Network namespaces are a Linux feature that can segment interfaces and routing tables away from the local network’s control, and other operating system maintainers should consider whether namespaces are feasible to implement. To help make this work accessible to as many people as possible, we are structuring this blog post to walk through the fundamentals of networking, VPN technology, and DHCP to fully explain the decloaking behavior. Advanced readers are welcome to jump straight to the proof-of-concept section. * After publication we’ve received notice that there are references to this decloaking behavior on social media. This further showcases the important of informing audiences outside of the technology sector of the existence of our technique. Decloaking Primer: Low-level Networking What is a network? A computer network is a group of computer devices that are connected to each other and can send and receive data to and from one another. A basic example of this is to connect two laptops with an Ethernet cable to network them together. However, there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to low-level networking that’s hidden from the average user. The laptops are using a system of rules to talk to each other, which we call protocols. Each protocol has its own purpose and operates at what we call a layer. These layers are intended to solve different types of problems and are built such that they do not need to know what’s happening at a higher or lower layer. This is called encapsulation. For example, a user can trust that the layers lower than their browser (HTTP) are determining how to send electricity over a cable (Coax), knows who to talk to (Ethernet, IP), and ensure correct data delivery to the recipient server (TCP). This is like how someone writing a letter needs only to think about what they want to write or what the other person wrote. They do not need to care about how it got there. When we’re referring to layers in this blogpost, we are talking about the practical TCP/IP model, which is implemented on almost every device and network. We also decided to use the 5-layer variant of the model because it doesn’t combine the lower layers together; this is why there might be a discrepancy when viewing other TCP/IP model diagrams. When we’re referring to data that’s been packaged by all these layers, we generally refer to it as a packet. Layer Brief Description Analogy Protocols Application Layer Determines the actual data that should be sent to a recipient. Words on a page of a letter in the mail. HTTP, DNS, HTTPS, DHCP Transport Layer Establishes end-to-end communication between a process on a host and a process on a recipient. A letter delivered to a specific apartment number. TCP, UDP Network Layer Sends traffic from a source system to a destination system across the internet. Delivering a letter to a single building in a city. IP, ARP Data Link Layer Controls traffic between systems on the same local network. A post office truck taking mail from place to place or city to city. Ethernet Physical Determines how to encode data over a “physical medium” such as copper wire or radio waves (Wi-Fi). Physically writing the letter and placing it in an envelope. Fiber optic, Coax, Satellite, Microwave What is a network interface? The most basic example of a network interface is a physical device such as a wireless or network card attached to a computer's motherboard. These devices allow the computer to transmit bits of data over a physical medium (e.g., a copper wire, fiber optic cable, or radio frequency). They are a fundamental part of networking as they are what allows computers to talk to each other over a distance. There are two types of network interfaces: Physical Network Interfaces Virtual Network Interfaces Importantly, both types of interfaces are designed for encapsulation so they can be interacted with by higher layers in the same way. This is where Virtual Network Interfaces, a critical component of VPN clients and server, come in. Instead of using physical hardware, Virtual Network Interfaces create a file descriptor that can be read from or written to via software applications. Because file descriptors exist only in the memory of a host, Virtual Network Interfaces are especially useful for virtualized environments where traffic might never need to be transmitted over a physical medium. Figure 1: A simplified example of a virtual interface that is not backed by a physical interface. Traffic between virtual machines never leaves the host. However, there are use cases in which a user might want a virtual interface to be able to send traffic over a physical medium. For those cases, the virtual interface can also be backed by a physical network interface. Behind the scenes, the virtual interface forwards outbound traffic to a physical network interface. Figure 2: An example of a virtual interface that is backed by a physical interface. What is a VPN? A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows users to create a tunnel for network traffic between their host device and a server on a different network. The resulting virtual network is not confined by geographic location while behaving identically to a physical network. To achieve this, VPN clients create a virtual network interface and use the underlying file descriptor to encrypt/decrypt traffic at a higher layer before sending it to a physical network interface. Figure 3: A simplified VPN setup where the VPN user is accessing a resource on a different network. VPN use is designed to be as simple as possible for a user. Often, they do not need to do much besides log in and click a button to connect to their server. What a user does: Select the settings they want on the VPN Client Click a button to connect Log in (optional in some cases, depending on the client) Read the confirmation from the VPN they are connected Use remote resources from the VPN Importantly, VPNs actually increase the host’s attack surface because traffic from lower networking layers is send over the Internet. VPNs work by encapsulating lower layers inside of higher layers to create local area networks (LAN) over the Internet. LAN traffic is considered to be more privileged than traffic that is intended to be sent over the Internet. Attackers with LAN access have many more passive and active attack options than an attacker outside of the LAN. By creating a LAN over the Internet, VPNs extend the LAN attack surface to external attackers. Commonly, VPNs mitigate this attack surface by using compensating controls such as packet encryption. This is an often-misunderstood fact about VPNs. The reason for encryption is not to increase the security of using the physical LAN, but rather to mitigate the added risk that VPNs introduce when they create a virtualized LAN over the Internet. VPNs do not secure you from local network attacks on the physical LAN despite common VPN marketing material and widely given advice. How do VPNs use virtual network interfaces? The VPN client process creates an encrypted version of the packet it originally received from the file descriptor associated with its virtual network interface. It places this encrypted payload in the layer for its underlying VPN protocol, then uses that protocol to talk to the VPN server. Layer in TCP/IP Packet 1 (Before encrypted by VPN) Packet 2 (Encrypted by VPN) Data Link Layer Ethernet: Sender network card: [Physical interface MAC] Dest. network card: [Router interface MAC] Ethernet: Source network card: [physical interface MAC] Destination network card: [Router interface MAC] Network Layer IP: Source IP: 1.234.56.56.78 Destination IP: 2.34.56.78 IP: Source IP: 1.234.56.78 Destination IP: 99.87.65.43 Transport Layer TCP: Sender port: 43555 Destination port: 80 UDP: Sender port: 54232 Destination port: 1194 Application Layer HTTP: GET google.com OpenVPN Protocol: Encrypted payload: Ethernet: Sender network card: [virtual interface] Dest. network card: [server’s interface] IP (packet 1) TCP (packet 1) HTTP (packet 1) There’s quite a long process for how a VPN sends that packet to the VPN Server. We are including a more exhaustive list of steps in the Appendix for security researchers or developers who might need even more granular details. A simplified version of that process: A VPN client establishes a “control channel” connection to a VPN server. If the VPN features a kill switch, then losing connection to this channel will result in a lockdown The VPN client creates a virtual network interface The VPN client optionally runs a startup script to configure the host. It may configure routing rules, the DNS server to use, host-based firewall rules, or other settings A process on the host attempts to send network traffic to a destination (i.e., Internet browsing) Routing rules select the VPN’s interface to send the traffic through The VPN client receives and encrypts that traffic The VPN client sends the encrypted traffic over a physically backed network interface to the VPN server The VPN server receives and decrypts that traffic from the VPN client The VPN server forwards that traffic to the destination. If the destination is outbound, the VPN will send your traffic as though it is its own. This behavior is what VPN providers describe as “IP cloaking” or “IP hiding” The VPN server receives a reply from the destination, encrypts the response, and sends it to the VPN client The VPN client decrypts the response, and the originating process finally receives the traffic It can be quite hard to understand fully since there are many steps involved. For that reason, we’ve made our own detailed diagram of a mental model we use for how a VPN client sends and receives information (Figure 4). Figure 4: A dataflow diagram of a VPN on a Linux host. How do routing based VPNs configure a host? Once a user connects to a VPN server, their VPN client process will configure the host’s settings to route traffic through the tunnel that it established. If all traffic* is routed through the VPN, we refer to it as a “full-tunnel VPN”. If there are user-defined exceptions for traffic, such as local network traffic, we refer to it as a “split-tunnel VPN”. The VPN client can also configure other settings on the host, such as the host’s firewall. Later, we’ll discuss a mitigation we observed using the host-based firewall. Commonly, these configuration changes are made by “up scripts” and “down scripts” when a connection is established or disconnected. The runtime process for a VPN client may also perform configuration changes, but this varies from vendor to vendor. *Note: When we say, “all traffic”, we really mean “all traffic except the traffic necessary to keep the VPN in a working state.” For example, VPNs create an exception to their own previously configured routing rules. All traffic sent to the VPN servers IP address must be sent over a hardware backed interface instead of its own tunnel. Otherwise, it would break the hosts connection to the VPN server and the VPN client would be unable to send encrypted packets. In addition, there are other configuration exceptions made for DHCP traffic since the VPN must maintain its hosts IP address lease. What are routes and routing tables? Routes are how we describe where to send traffic based on the destination. Routing tables are a collection of routes that are used by the network stack. Consider a network stack to just be all the code on an operating system that deals with sending and receiving data from a network. A common route is sending all traffic (0.0.0.0/0 in Classless Inter-Domain Routing [CIDR] notation) to your router (192.168.1.1) over the physical network interface (eth0). An example of that rule in the table would be: 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 Another behavior of routing tables is that by default (in most network stacks) the most specific prefix length for the CIDR range has the highest priority. The prefix length for the range 192.168.1.1/32 is 32 and the prefix length for the range 0.0.0.0/0 is 0. The highest numerical value of a prefix length will take priority for routing selection (unless configured otherwise). For example: 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 10.10.10.1/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev wifi1 10.10.10.2/32 via 192.168.1.2 dev eth0 In this situation, if we sent traffic to 10.10.10.2, the most specific rule is the /32 rule and it would therefore be the rule the network stack uses despite matching the other two rules above it. Most full-tunnel VPNs use the least specific rule possible to capture all traffic. Note that the following example includes an exception route for the hypothetical VPN server address (12.34.56.78) as well. 0.0.0.0/0 via 10.13.37.1 dev tun0 12.34.56.78/32 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 Alternatively, providers may use two /1 rules to gain priority over the default route. It's common in even non-adversarial environments for DHCP to set a default route to the physical gateway. 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 0.0.0.0/1 via 10.13.37.1 dev tun0 128.0.0.0/1 via 10.13.37.1 dev tun0 12.34.56.78/32 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 What is DHCP? DHCP was originally developed as a robust way to dynamically issue IP addresses to devices on a local network as opposed to manually addressing each device. All modern operating systems have their own DHCP client that will automatically request an IP address. The main concept to understand is that DHCP provides a time-based lease for IP addresses, and it contains many additional features called options that allow you to adjust the configuration of devices remotely and dynamically. Some notable options include setting the default gateway that acts as the primary route to the Internet or DNS (Domain Name System) servers, which resolve domain names like “google.com” to an IP address. A client who wants an IP address uses a broadcast to send a DHCPDISCOVER packet to the entire local subnet. Other hosts will ignore this, except for the server who will respond with a DHCPOFFER unicasted directly to the client to offer it a time-bound lease. Alternatively, if a client knows who the DHCP server is, it has the option to unicast the DHCPDISCOVER to a DHCP server instead of broadcasting. Usually, this is used for renewing its lease. Figure 5: How a DHCP client obtains an IP address and then maintains its lease. Source: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1453/dhcp-overview-3.html As seen in the above diagram, once a DHCP server makes an offer, the client can choose to accept or decline the offer. For example, if it receives multiple offers, it will choose the best one. The selection most often implemented by DHCP clients is “first come, first serve.” The servers that aren’t selected will be sent a DHCPDECLINE message from the client. Notably, the DHCPOFFER will include the options. What is DHCP option 121? In 1997, the DHCP RFC had option 33, which allowed network administrators to specify a static route to install into a client’s routing table. However, this used classful static routes, which fell out of favor over time as public IP space became limited. In 2002, RFC 3442 introduced option 121 classless static routes and obsoleted option 33 (which still should be supported, depending on who you ask). Option 121 also allows administrators to add static routes to a client’s routing table, but with classless ranges instead. There is no limit besides packet size to how many different routes can be installed at once. An interesting quirk of DHCP option 121 is that the network interface device for the route it installs cannot be specified by the DHCP server. Below you can see a DHCPOFFER packet that was captured in Wireshark. It specifies the CIDR range and the router to use but has no interface device. Figure 6: A DHCPOFFER packet that includes an option 121 route. The network interface is not specified by design. Instead, the DHCP client will implicitly choose the network interface that the client is talking to the DHCP server on when installing its routing rules for this option. Decloaking Attacks Requirements for decloaking VPN traffic The targeted host must accept a DHCP lease from the attacker-controlled server The targeted host’s DHCP client must implement DHCP option 121 We want to stress that there are ways an attacker who is on the same network as a targeted user might be able to become their DHCP server: A rogue DHCP server using a DHCP starvation attack against the true DHCP, then responding to new clients. We have achieved this in lab environments and are working on a follow-up blog post. A rogue DHCP server racing to respond to DHCPDISCOVER broadcasts to abuse DHCP clients’ common behavior where they implement first-offer lease selection. ARP spoofing to intercept traffic between the true DHCP server and client, then waiting for a client to renew their lease. Performing the attack Our technique is to run a DHCP server on the same network as a targeted VPN user and to also set our DHCP configuration to use itself as a gateway. When the traffic hits our gateway, we use traffic forwarding rules on the DHCP server to pass traffic through to a legitimate gateway while we snoop on it. We use DHCP option 121 to set a route on the VPN user’s routing table. The route we set is arbitrary and we can also set multiple routes if needed. By pushing routes that are more specific than a /0 CIDR range that most VPNs use, we can make routing rules that have a higher priority than the routes for the virtual interface the VPN creates. We can set multiple /1 routes to recreate the 0.0.0.0/0 all traffic rule set by most VPNs. Pushing a route also means that the network traffic will be sent over the same interface as the DHCP server instead of the virtual network interface. This is intended functionality that isn’t clearly stated in the RFC. Therefore, for the routes we push, it is never encrypted by the VPN’s virtual interface but instead transmitted by the network interface that is talking to the DHCP server. As an attacker, we can select which IP addresses go over the tunnel and which addresses go over the network interface talking to our DHCP server. Figure 7: A malicious DHCP option 121 route that causes traffic to never be encrypted by the VPN process. We now have traffic being transmitted outside the VPN’s encrypted tunnel. This technique can also be used against an already established VPN connection once the VPN user’s host needs to renew a lease from our DHCP server. We can artificially create that scenario by setting a short lease time in the DHCP lease, so the user updates their routing table more frequently. In addition, the VPN control channel is still intact because it already uses the physical interface for its communication. In our testing, the VPN always continued to report as connected, and the kill switch was never engaged to drop our VPN connection. Proof of Concept Video proof of concept: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU Lab Setup Code: https://github.com/leviathansecurity/TunnelVision DHCP Server image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLJGs3ZUypf6hLh5WL4AJmsKdUOZo5yZ The lab scenarios are built to represent: An attacker compromises a DHCP server/access point A rogue administrator owns the infrastructure themselves and maliciously configures it An attacker sets up an evil twin wireless AP in a physical location such as a coffee shop or corporate office One we release our tool, ArcaneTrickster, the lab can also be used to mimic an attacker who has an adjacent host on the network na dis otherwise not in a privileged network position Fixes Network Namespaces Using network namespaces on Linux can completely fix this behavior. However, in our experience, it is less commonly implemented. WireGuard’s documentation shows how it’s possible to use a namespace for all applications with traffic that should be using a VPN before sending it to another namespace that contains a physical interface. However, this appears to be Linux-specific functionality and it’s not clear if there is a solution for Windows, MacOS, or other operating systems with the same amount of robustness. Mitigations Firewall Rules We’ve observed VPN providers denying all inbound and outbound traffic to and from the physical interface via firewall rules. An exception was necessary for the DHCP and VPN server IPs because they are necessary to remain connected to the LAN and VPN server. Deep packet inspection could also allow only the DHCP and VPN protocols instead but would likely incur a performance penalty. Problems with Firewall Rule Mitigations Firewall mitigations create a selective denial of service for traffic using the DHCP route and introduce a side-channel. An attacker can use this side-channel to determine the destination of traffic. To determine the traffic’s destination, an attacker could perform traffic analysis on the volume of VPN encrypted traffic a user sends. The attacker would need a baseline volume of traffic where no malicious are installed. Then the attacker would need to modify the lease configuration to install routes that deny traffic and observe the difference in volume. With enough samples, it would be possible to statistically prove whether the targeted user is sending traffic to a specific destination. For the average internet user, most internet traffic is already secured by TLS. Therefore, traffic intercepted by TunnelVision will mostly be unreadable except for the destination and protocols. This means that this side-channel has nearly the same impact and should be considered insufficient. The side-channel is flexible in use: The traffic can be checked against a predefined list. The traffic can be selectively denied as a censorship mechanism. The attacker can use IP space denial with binary search to determine all current connections in logarithmic time. Ignore Option 121 Another possible mitigation is ignoring option 121 while the VPN is on. We noted that because Android does not implement support for DHCP option 121, it was uniquely unaffected. The downside is that option 121 exists for a reason, and ignoring these routes can break network connectivity (something that is frequently brought up as a reason to implement it on Android). If this mitigation is implemented, it must be mandatory because attackers could simply deny network access until the VPN or user re-enables option 121. Use a Hot Spot or VM Hot spots are temporary Wi-Fi networks controlled by a cellular device. They create a password-locked LAN with automatic network address translation. Because this network is completely controlled by the cellular device and requires a password, an attacker should not have local network access. A virtual machine would also work similarly as long as the VM’s network adapter is not in bridged mode. Do not use untrusted networks if you need absolute confidentiality of your traffic Industry Impact Is TunnelVision a vulnerability? This is debatable. We’re calling it a technique because TunnelVision doesn’t rely on violating any security properties of the underlying technologies. From our perspective, TunnelVision is how DHCP, routing tables, and VPNs are intended to work. However, it contradicts VPN providers’ assurances that are commonly referenced in marketing materials; in our opinion, TunnelVision becomes a vulnerability when a VPN provider makes assurances that their product secures a customer from an attacker on an untrusted network. There’s a big difference between protecting your data in transit and protecting against all LAN attacks. VPNs were not designed to mitigate LAN attacks on the physical network and to promise otherwise is dangerous. In our technique, we have not broken the VPN’s cryptographically secured protocol, and the VPN is still fully functional. An attacker is instead forcing a target user to not use their VPN tunnel. Regardless of whether we classify this as a technique, VPN users are affected when they rely on assurances that a VPN can secure them from attackers on their local network. Affected Operating Systems In our testing, we observed that any operating system that implements a DHCP client according to its RFC specification and has support for DHCP option 121 routes is affected. This includes Windows, Linux, iOS, and MacOS. Notably, it does not affect Android as they do not have support for DHCP option 121. Affected VPN Providers and VPN Protocols We found that VPNs that solely rely on routing rules to secure the host’s traffic are vulnerable. Those who are hosting their own VPN servers (e.g., system administrators) and are not hardening their VPN client configurations will likely be vulnerable as well. We have observed a mitigation from some VPN providers that drops traffic to non-VPN interfaces via firewall rules. It’s possible there are other methods that we did not encounter during testing to mitigate or fix this. As previously mentioned, we observed the same behavior on each operating system we tested, save one. Furthermore, the strength of the encryption algorithm a VPN uses makes no difference. TunnelVision’s effect is independent of the underlying VPN protocol (e.g., WireGuard, OpenVPN, or IPsec) because it reconfigures the operating system network stack the VPN relies on. Conclusion Call to Action We have a limitation as a research team of two– there are simply too many VPNs on the market to test each one individually. The first approach we took was to notify companies via bug bounties or security disclosure email, but that quickly became unscalable. We’ve also engaged the EFF and CISA to help disclose as broadly as possible prior to publicly releasing this research. We thank them tremendously for their help. Our hope is that by publishing our work, we can reach more affected parties, especially because we believe the technique has been feasible since as early as 2002. Although the public disclosure of this technique affects each party differently, ultimately there is a shared responsibility. Users should be made aware of this technique and for sensitive traffic they should be warned against using untrusted networks. If they must use an untrusted network, they should use a VPN provider that has an effective mitigation against this technique. To determine if a provider has an effective mitigation or fix, our lab setup is available for testing and VPN providers themselves will be able to speak to the specifics of their existing mitigations in their documentation. If a VPN decloak does occur, most user data will not be visible to local network attackers assuming they are accessing websites with HTTPS, which has become increasingly common. It is common for corporate VPNs to be used in areas such as coffee shops, hotels, or airports. Network administrators should inform employees that working from such places carries risks and should be avoided when possible. If such a policy is not practical, then administrators should advise using VPNs that enable the previously mentioned mitigations or fixes. Some alternatives would be to use a trusted hot spot and then connect to the VPN. Lastly, running the VPN inside of a VM that obtains a lease from a virtualized DHCP server would prevent the local networks DHCP server from installing routes altogether. Companies that control their own networks or have site-to-site VPNs should review the switches they use and enable features such as DHCP snooping and ARP protections. These layer 2 protections help prevent rogue DHCP servers but do not eliminate a rogue administrator scenario. In addition, implementing HTTPS or other protocols with encryption for internal resources will prevent data leakage from VPN users connecting from untrusted networks. VPN providers can add features to clients to configure firewall rules that drop outbound packets to network interfaces. However, such a setting will mean that a VPN user will be isolated from interacting with local network resources. If the VPN client is for Linux and is intended to be a full tunnel, using network namespaces for isolation. As such, VPN providers should publicly provide documentation about any mitigations or fixes they have for TunnelVision and warn their end users about TunnelVision’s existence. We also recommend reviewing their marketing material and cease marketing claims that VPNs protect customers on untrusted networks until it can be proven. Operating system maintainers (outside of Linux) should determine whether adding or enhancing features related to network namespaces is feasible. Upcoming Research During the disclosure process, we encountered multiple cases in which the entities we disclosed to did not see this as a serious problem. They assumed that the prerequisite conditions included privileged positions or accounts, despite the only prerequisite being local network access. This assumption was partially fueled by our intentionally simplistic lab setup where we were the only DHCP server, and what we perceive as the entity’s lack of familiarity with low-level networking. With this feedback, we decided to develop a robust adversarial infrastructure library to enable further LAN security research and demonstrate practical attacks. For example, we can demonstrate that it’s possible to consistently perform TunnelVision while simply being adjacent to the target host on the same LAN. We’re calling it “ArcaneTrickster” and plan on releasing it at a later date. However, we feature a demo in our videos, which are available in the proof of concept section.

However, it was implied that DHCP only pushed default routes and did not account for DHCP option 121. In August 2023, a paper was published demonstrating that routing rules can be attacked in different ways to leak VPN traffic. The paper details two methods of leaking VPN traffic: Abusing non-RFC1918 IP ranges to leak traffic. DNS spoofing the VPN server’s domain name to trick the VPN client into adding a routing rule exception for an IP address. However, neither technique described in the August 2023 paper leveraged DHCP option 121 to push routes. Pushing routes through DHCP has a significantly higher impact from the same attacker vantage point (the ability to hand out IP leases for a non-RFC1918 range or spoofing DNS replies). In-Depth Diagram Explanation For posterity and because we haven’t encountered another diagram like ours (Figure 4), below are the steps from the diagram in as much detail as we could reasonably provide. We feel it could be useful to a future security researcher or a developer trying to understand the technology, so we are including it for their benefit. An application process sends a payload to a socket it creates. The socket formats the payload into a packet and sends it to the routing table to determine which interface it should be sent through. The routing table determines that the packet should be sent through tun0. The routing table sends the packet to the firewall. The firewall rules allow the packet to continue to tun0. The network interface serializes the packet and writes it into a file descriptor at /dev/net/tun in userland. The VPN client process reads the unencrypted raw bytes of the packet in the file descriptor. The VPN process creates an encrypted payload and sends it to a socket the VPN made. The socket formats the payload into a packet that is bound for the VPN’s server and sends it to the routing table to determine which interface it should be sent through. The routing table determines that the packet must be sent over the wlan0 interface. The routing table sends the packet to the firewall. The firewall rules determine that the outbound packet may continue using wlan0. The network interface transfers the packet to its Wi-Fi driver. The Wi-Fi driver sends the VPN-bound packet to the physical network interface card (NIC). The packet is sent across the internet to the VPN server. The VPN server sends a packet in response back to the physical NIC. The NIC sends the response packet to the Wi-Fi driver. The Wi-Fi driver delivers the response packet to wlan0. The response packet is sent to the firewall. The firewall rules allow the packet to continue. The packet is returned to the VPN socket. The socket receives the packet and sends the packet’s encrypted payload to the VPN client process. The VPN client process decrypts the payload and writes the unencrypted raw bytes of the response packet to the file descriptor. The tun0 interface deserializes the bytes from the file descriptor and formats it into a packet. The tun0 interface sends the packet to the firewall. The firewall rules allow the packet to continue. The packet is returned to the socket opened by the user’s application process. The payload from the packet is returned to the application process. vpnnetwork securitycvevulnerabilityttptunnelvisionwifi Cody Martin",

You plug it into the victim device, advertise two more specific routes of 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 and then you get all the traffic in preference to other system interfaces despite interface ordering: https://github.com/samyk/poisontap I imagine there is also probably some other prior art. But that's a very well known one. They also claim that it affects all VPN clients in the headline, yet so many such clients setup firewall rules to block traffic to/from the physical interface as they acknowledge in the write-up. Most of the VPNs that are claiming to hide your identity or where such cloaking is important tend to implement that. I'm sure plenty of setups don't have it enabled by default, but I think it would have been productive to document what percentage of leading personal/commercial and corporate VPN solutions have this enabled by default. A good write-up and explanation for the lay person, but I think the headline over-sells it a little bit given the number of clients that would prevent most of the data leak with those firewall rules and not acknowledging the prior art in this area. reply banister 8 hours agoparentWell said. This is a nothing-burger for all VPNs except the ones that are likely heavily leaking already due to the absence of basic firewall rules. Their \"side channel attack\" also made me spit out my drink. EDIT: looks like NordVPN (at least on mac) doesn't have those basic firewall rules and so IS vulnerable to this exploit. reply foobiekr 6 hours agorootparentA general rule for life is that companies making a big deal about military grade encryption or about how they are affiliated with Nordic countries are scams. reply froddd 1 hour agorootparentCan you expand on that? Specifically the affiliation with Nordic countries? I’m a Nord VPN customer, I’d quite like to know more — may help inform any future decision on renewing or even staying with them. reply sigmoid10 1 hour agorootparentIn general, Nordic countries are known for their extensive privacy laws, which in theory would make it harder for law enforcement to gain access to your traffic (and with a court order it is very easy to decloak your VPN traffic). However, as all Nordic countries are part of the Schengen Area, they are bound by European laws - and their enforcement. When Europol started cracking down on VPN providers that didn't comply, NordVPN (and all others who wanted to remain in the European market) were forced to admit [1] that they do comply with law enforcement orders. Today, all VPNs that you can legally buy are worthless in the aspects they advertise to you. You neither get extra security through encryption when browsing the web (https is already good enough for public wifi) nor actual privacy from your own government. There is exactly one use case for public commercial VPNs these days: If you want to easily access the internet from a different location to bypass geoblocking. But many big services like Netflix have started to simply block or otherwise limit access from traffic that comes from big VPN provider IP ranges, so even that use-case is becoming more worthless every year.

All (serious) VPN providers claim they don't store logs. But that does not mean that a court can't force them to do so. When combined with a gag order you can have someone collecting all your traffic without you even realizing it. And that's just the VPN provider, which usually doesn't own any datacenters. The datacenter providers can also receive the orders to either monitor traffic or even install hardware to do so. If you want any hope of privacy, you steer clear of all big commercial \"privacy\" providers, because they are very high on every government agency's list. And you just need one component in the entire chain to be compromised. reply carlhjerpe 27 minutes agorootparentYou're spreading FUD, the Swedish government can't do shit to Mullvad but take their servers offline.

There’s no way I’m reading 20 pages of networking for absolute toddlers to try to find it. reply josephcsible 3 hours agorootparentThe side channel attack lets the attacker determine whether or not you're trying to connect to certain IP addresses over your VPN. If you properly fix this, then even when the DHCP server is performing the attack, the traffic in question still goes through your VPN. If you just mitigate it, then when the DHCP server is performing the attack, the traffic will be dropped. The side channel is that if you just mitigate it, then the attacker can repeatedly start and stop the attack for specific IP addresses, while monitoring how much VPN traffic you're sending and receiving. reply ikiris 37 minutes agorootparentThat’s certainly a take. reply Aloisius 12 hours agoprevI don't know why this article is so long.

For a general IT audience you are speaking to, context building really helps refresh the scene before dropping the exploit. Well communicated. reply banister 11 hours agorootparentprevI looked at this in detail. This exploit is a nothing-burger for most decent VPNs. A simple \"leak protection\" (aka Killswitch) firewall rule completely negates this attack. All decent VPNs implement such a rule by default. Dealing with undesirable routes (whether pre existing or pushed by a DHCP server) is nothing new or in the slightest bit hard to defend against. If a VPN does not implement such a firewall rule already then it's likely already leaking so all this exploit demonstrates is that \"A VPN without leak protection, leaks\". (I won't even mention the \"side channel\" attack as it's completely ridiculous) I liked your write-up and option 121 is a little known option, so it's good to know about. But let's not pretend this thing is bigger than it is. reply CommitSyn 11 hours agorootparentFTA: Importantly, the VPN control channel is maintained so features such as kill switches are never tripped, and users continue to show as connected to a VPN in all the cases we’ve observed. reply banister 11 hours agorootparentThey don't know what they're talking about. Kill switches are not \"tripped\" there is no \"control channel\". A kill switch is just a firewall rule that is ALWAYS engaged and all it does is blocks off-VPN traffic. It 100% will defend against this exploit. reply jcrawfordor 10 hours agorootparentMost practical VPN services don't actually implement it this way, it's a somewhat difficult and rather OS-specific problem depending on the firewall services offered by the OS. On some popular OS like mobile ones it's just not possible at all. So just to grab an example, NordVPN's implementation does indeed work as the article presents: it monitors the VPN and disables network access for applications if the VPN connection drops. This is indeed vulnerable to any number of potential problems, and depending on the OS and user savvy you can set up better protection using e.g. the iptables owner module. It's very non-portable though, sometimes even between Linux distributions, and hard to support at scale. Actually I'd say a true \"no access except through the VPN\" rule is easiest to implement on Windows, but NordVPN doesn't seem to do it there either, I'm not sure why. To be fair, it's right in the name: a kill switch is a switch that kills things. It isn't proper network policy like per-process routing tables that are, unfortunately, difficult to implement for consumer machines. reply banister 10 hours agorootparentMobile is an exception (but they already state android is immune), let's stick to desktop for the sake of discussion, the 3 major desktop platforms: mac, win, linux :) On mac - just implement a block everything rule with pf and then just allow traffic on the tunnel and whitelist the VPN endpoint. Boom, a kill switch that defends against this exploit. And there's no racey nordvpn-style \"control channel\" (if nord really works like this i have an even lower opinion of them than i do currently). On linux - iptables (for example) - just implement a general DROP policy then override with a specific ALLOW on the tunnel interface. On Windows - Use WFP to implement a block everything rule, then provide a higher priority rule to allow on the tunnel interface. All three of these techniques are the recommended way to implement a kill switch and it's used heavily in the VPN industry by anyone sensible. It completely defends against this TunnelVision exploit too. The way that you suggest kill switch is implemented (reactive and monitoring the connection?) is very fragile, racey and prone to leak, i absolutely would not trust it and it shouldn't even be called a kill switch. It's an embarrassment. :) reply jcrawfordor 10 hours agorootparentI'm not saying how it should be implemented, I'm saying how it is implemented by a number of popular VPN services. Take up the argument with them. There are VPN providers that do it right on at least some platforms, but unfortunately the way most document it it's very hard to tell without experimenting with the client to verify. As far as I know, use of the term \"kill switch\" closely correlates with an untrustworthy implementation. Consider the case of Mullvad who handle this a lot better and also decline to call it a \"kill switch\" for that reason. And that's not to say that Mullvad is perfect, easy to find forum threads by people who had traffic leakage for various reasons. I wouldn't trust anything you didn't set up yourself. reply Borealid 9 hours agorootparentprevYou wrote three different ways to end up with all traffic dropped and a broken VPN connection. Traffic sent to the VPN interface gets encapsulated by the VPN client software and then routed to the Internet. If your firewall rule is dropping all traffic not destined for the VPN interface, it will drop the encapsulated traffic. You need two (sets of) rules: one allowing traffic on the VPN interface and one allowing traffic which is already cloaked by the VPN software (or not cloaked, but used to establish/maintain the tunnel itself). That second category is a bit complicated, because you need to be able to route to the VPN server regardless of which network you're connected to - and the DHCP server tells you how to do that. reply banister 8 hours agorootparentYes. I just provided simplified firewall rules in my answer. You also need to whitelist either the VPN endpoint itself (and add a route to that endpoint) or you need to whitelist the process (such as wireguard or openvpn) that hits that endpoint. Not sure how a DHCP server is relevant in the slightest here except for the initial host network config of course. But the host network should already be configured before the VPN comes up. Source: i've implemented this dozens of times (and you probably have too, it sounds like) so let's not quibble over the details ;) reply Borealid 8 hours agorootparentIf you're connected to a random network, whose configuration you don't know in advance, how do you route packets to your VPN server? The usual answer is that the network's router tells you how to do that, by supplying DHCP options. The point I'm making here is that you can't just configure a firewall rule and have it work properly. What actually needs to happen is that the VPN client software is using one routing table - let's call it \"host routing\" - and everything else on the system is using a second routing table - let's call that \"VPN routing\". The DHCP server inserts rules into the host routing table, and the only software using those rules is the VPN client for its management and tunnel traffic. Otherwise, what if the network to which you connect says \"the next hop for all internet traffic is 10.10.10.10\"? You need to respect that rule when sending traffic to your VPN server, and ignore it for applications whose traffic will be tunneled. reply banister 7 hours agorootparentLet's walk through this step by step because there's a lot of confusion on your end. * Step one - You connect your computer to a network - yes you'll get a DHCP lease, and you'll get an ip address, and a default gateway. This default route will be added to your routing table. * Step two - If the TunnelVision exploit (DHCP option 121) is at play you'll also get a few MORE SPECIFIC routes than the default gateway. These also get added to your routing table * Step three - You connect your VPN. The VPN will bring up a firewall. It will also bring up `128/1` and `0/1` routes that point at the VPN tunnel. The VPN tunnel now takes over the default route. This firewall will block all traffic that's not on the tun device (the VPN interface). Further, it will whitelist the VPN endpoint IP and create a route for it (it can do this since it already received the default gateway from the DHCP server) * Step four - Your host starts sending traffic - either this traffic will go through the VPN tunnel (the default route) OR it will attempt to go through the more specific option 121 pushed malicious routes added by the compromised DHCP server (depending on the destination ip of the outbound packets). * Step five - All traffic that would go down the malicious option 121 routes are BLOCKED by the firewall rule. Hence nullifying the TunnelVision exploit. That's all. Done. Where's the complexity in that? As i said before i've done this dozens of times. I'm talking from experience. I know this works. Further you say: > The point I'm making here is that you can't just configure a firewall rule and have it work properly. What actually needs to happen is that the VPN client software is using one routing table - let's call it \"host routing\" - and everything else on the system is using a second routing table - let's call that \"VPN routing\". You are aware we're talking about consumer VPNs right? The majority of users are on Windows and Mac. Neither of those OSes support multiple routing tables. Only Linux supports multiple routing tables. You're also just plain wrong - as i demonstrated above - you CAN just configure a firewall rule and it WILL just work properly. Again, i'm talking from experience. reply pests 3 hours agorootparentIn your step 4, what happens when the VPN traffic gets routed over option 121 pushed routes? Don't you block it - thus blocking your entire VPN? > OR it will attempt to go through the more specific option 121 pushed malicious routes added by the compromised DHCP server (depending on the destination ip of the outbound packets). This right here... we don't want our VPN-secued traffic going out over routes broadcast by the malicious DHCP server, so you block it... right? How does that traffic leave the local network and reach the VPN server? reply banister 31 minutes agorootparentRead my reply to the other poster, i answer exactly this. Actually test it yourself. Stop theorizing. I tested it. It works exactly as I said. I think i know where you're confused. There is a firewall whitelist on the VPN endpoint route. Also it's impossible for the DHCP server to push a route more specific than this since it's a /32 route, so it's unaffected (together with the firewall rule allowing it) by anything the DHCP server attempts to do. Borealid 4 hours agorootparentprevI think you missed a step in your progression. Step one, you connect to the network and get routes. Step two, you connect your VPN. Step three, your host starts sending traffic. At this point, your firewall rules are now active and dropping any traffic you've told them to. Step four, you renew your DHCP lease and get new routes via option 121. Those routes might be malicious, or they might not. One of three things is true at step four. Either: A. Your firewall rules will block all traffic over the new routes B. Your firewal rules will not block any traffic over the new routes C. Your firewall rules will block some subset of traffic over the new routes If A is true, then your VPN tunnel goes down (undesirable), as the VPN server can no longer be contacted. If B is true, then you are vulnerable to the TunnelVision exploit. If C is true, and the subset of traffic blocked is exactly the subset intended to route over the VPN but maliciously diverted, then the VPN tunnel goes down because the firewall rules are blocking its traffic. If C is true, and somehow the firewall rule is rewriting the traffic that's pointed not-over-the-VPN to be instead routed over the VPN (by using NAT?), then the VPN tunnel stays up and there is no problem. I'd be interested in seeing the set of firewall rules that will let the VPN tunnel stay up, with management traffic going over the added-after-the-tunnel-was-brought-up next-hop, and tunneled traffic continuing to flow ignoring the new route. I haven't seen those rules in the past so if you have experience writing them, please show me. Personally I've only used Linux multiple routing tables to plug this leak. EDIT: formatting reply banister 33 minutes agorootparentNo, you're wrong again. I just tested this (simulating routes added by a DHCP option 121) and it works exactly as I said. C is what happens. But it doesn't happen the way you say at all. Only the traffic heading to the new 121 routes are blocked - why is it blocked? because the routes are on the physical interface, and the firewall rules blocks all off-VPN traffic (except traffic to the endpoint) The tunnel stays up because the tunnel connection is over the physical interface. The VPN endpoint is a physical route from the host to the VPN endpoint which is whitelisted in the firewall. So new physical routes (which option 121 would push) don't impact anything as VPN endpoint route is physical anyway. Also it's impossible for the DHCP server to push a route MORE specific than the endpoint route (which is a /32) that already exists, so it can't be overridden. Can you stop just talking and actually TRY it? it's all theoretical for you since you're not actually testing it and your theory is completely wrong. I am actually testing it, so i know I am correct. 0x457 10 hours agorootparentprevLet's be honest, there're 2 OSs on desktop that matter to VPN providers that provide \"all-in-one app\" - Windows and macOS. Both have easy to configure from your application. On linux, well, you have to choose: - use iptables style rules regardless of the backend or - use nftables style rules regardless of the backend. So it's 3 firewalls that you have to think about. On mobile, well, on mobile you're mostly at the mercy of the platform owner and generally can't do much.

For example, how frequently do you hear about compromised networks of routers and access points? Attackers could be using those for far more stealthy means. Also, remember when Verizon decided to helpfully inject cross-domain tracking cookies into their customers’ traffic? Do you really want to gamble that some MBA wouldn’t start to think about ways to monetize activity collection from VPN users?

Sadly, there are carriers on this planet who think it's a good idea to charge ridiculous prices for mobile data (Germany) or to block hotspot functionality unless you pay up (US, see [1] for the technical background - both Apple and Google are complicit). In a world where politicians would care about their people, there would be no need for wifi hotspots to exist in the first place. Additionally, there are certain advertising brokers such as utiq that cooperate with major phone networks to provide detailed tracking, so they and advertisers know pretty precisely who you are just because you tethered your laptop to your phone. And finally, you can't trust your phone ISP either - Verizon got caught red-handed injecting tracking \"supercookies\" into their customers' traffic [2], thank God at least that vector got closed with everyone and their dog going HTTPS.

DHCP works on an broadcast protocol and your device will accept the first offer. The fact that the most common residential configuration is for your DHCP to be hosted on your router and thus likely the first to respond is inconsequential to the fact that any hostile device on your network could use this exploit. reply pushedx 10 hours agorootparentnot implying anything in that regard, I can imagine a clever attack which involves a local malicious dhcp implementation reply immibis 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's not at all guaranteed.

I.e. systemd-networkd have support for doing that out of the box. One thing to watch out or is that when enabling VRF, the ip rule entry for l3mdev is listed as 1000 but rule for local traffic is listed as 0, the local rule should be moved to 1000+. reply sargun 11 hours agoparentIs there a way to run an app in a specific VRF nowadays? reply isodude 11 hours agorootparentLook here: https://jerryxiao.cc/archives/1004 Yes, it's eBPF but the solution is quite neat to be honest.

It’s been available for a while now reply caeruleus 3 hours agoprevThis should have been pretty obvious for more technical people, but it's a nice introduction into networking and VPNs. I have configured a Linux VPN gateway VM a couple of times now and the reliance on the routing table only always felt brittle, especially when paired with running on the same machine that uses the connection. In addition to network namespaces and physical VPN gateway routers, an architecture based on VMs can thus also solve this. In my homelab, the firewall blocks any unexpected traffic from the VPN gateway VM (devices in the VPN VLAN are not allowed any outgoing connections, the gateway VM has a separate VLAN for outgoing ones). As a personal solution, QubesOS makes configuring a similar setup quite friction-less, but once again requires more technical knowledge than a regular OS. reply dpeckett 2 hours agoprevAn interesting (and portable) alternative to network namespaces is to bypass kernel networking entirely and use a userspace network stack.

I wonder the same. Perhaps someone who works at Google with access to the internal Buganizer will know more. But if you want me to speculate, my speculation is that the team behind Android networking is highly pro-IPv6. They don't really care about missing niche features in IPv4. Even for IPv6 they have a specific vision for how IPv6 should be used, resulting in deliberate non-support of features like stateful DHCPv6. reply skissane 11 hours agoparentprevThere are so many DHCP options, for something like Android it makes sense to start with only supporting the bare minimum and then only enable support for an additional option if there is a requirement raised for it. Given this DHCP option isn’t commonly used, such a strategy would likely result in it not being supported, irrespective of any security concerns with it. reply megous 10 hours agoparentprevAndroid doesn't even implement the new DHCP version defined first 21 years ago: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3315 So not really a surprise. reply EasyMark 11 hours agoprevI haven't seen anywhere that said there can be a \"fix\" for this outside of not allowing \"option 121\" to be in use at all the DHCP server. Is there no way to mitigate this in the VPN client, or is it simply too fundamental to the way the networks work that there is and never can be a \"fix\" on the VPN client? I wouldn't expect a malware laden network's \"admin\" to ever fix this or even hear about it. reply morattisec 11 hours agoparentThe only fix we’ve observed in the wild was limited to Linux hosts. WireGuard has documentation about how to implement that properly using network namespaces which can be used to isolate network stacks. https://www.wireguard.com/netns/ however, the VPN provider must implement it this way. In our demo we use WireGuard that is implemented without namespaces. The other operating systems do not support that feature. The mitigations we saw were firewall based rules, which create a side-channel that be used to leak the destination of traffic. reply banister 11 hours agorootparentThe \"side channel\" is silly. You assume someone is hitting the same endpoint over and over and over and with significantly high traffic that it rises above the noise. Did u even do any of the math required to demonstrate it can actually work in a reasonable time frame? Did u clearly list the very onerous assumptions required to pull it off? This whole thing is silly. reply morattisec 11 hours agorootparentSo in the example we gave for the side-channel you’d be correct that “it depends”. We also wrote that it was flexible. I do want to point out that you could deny all traffic except allow a single IP address to test the inverse in a low traffic setting. With a low DHCP lease time it’s feasible that could look like a shaky connection. This is only possible because the kill switches don’t actually disconnect the user. There’s also mitigation bypasses that are likely to be discovered, we have a few we’re working on. reply banister 10 hours agorootparentThe side channel attack is silly and impractical. You know it's silly. I know it's silly. Let's quit pretending. The firewall rule is 100% sufficient to defend against this exploit. All good VPNs already provide it by default. It's not deep. They're just routes. Please stop the FUD. reply StressedDev 9 hours agorootparentSide channels are a huge danger. An example is cryptographic functions have been cracked because of timing differences based on the key or data being encrypted. This is why cryptographic ciphers are implemented in constant time code (i.e. code that always runs in the same amount of time regardless of its input). reply banister 8 hours agorootparentI'm talking about the specific side channel attack mentioned in their report. Not side channels generally ;) reply banister 11 hours agoparentprevMost decent VPNs are already protected against it. It's a simple firewall rule known as leak protection or a kill switch which blocks all off-VPN traffic including on option 121 routes.

Is there better approach then just disabling all other network interfaces? reply isodude 11 hours agorootparentAFAIK Wireguard will always listen in the default namespace, thus you need to isolate everything else. A fun way of doing it though is to do an ip rule that uses the VRF table, and matches on the user id. That way all traffic from certain users will always end up in the same routing table. You can go further and match on everything except the Wireguard endpoint. With iptables you can MARK the traffic you want to be differently and then catch that traffic with ip rule. reply exabrial 4 hours agoprevSame like on device vpns are pretty sketchy. reply tristor 12 hours agoprevThere are numerous ways to defeat a VPN on a client device, this is why I prefer to put a router that terminates VPN tunnels with no other available routes between my clients and the Internet when I feel the need for a VPN. You can trivially set up one of these \"travel routers\" and carry it with you everywhere, which is exactly what I do. reply AnotherGoodName 11 hours agoparentI highly encourage dedicated VPN routers at home with each router having it's own wifi network as a way to connect to VPNs. It's easier to connect and more reliable than locally running VPN software on each device imho. Eg. I have a router sharing wifi for 'work' with a permanently maintained vpn connection to the workplace intranet. Another sharing wifi as 'Australia' that I connect to whenever I want to watch TV from Australia with a VPN to an Australian server and lastly the standard home Internet wifi. It's super easy to do if you have a couple of old wifi routers and even cheap home ones seem to have some VPN support these days. A big advantage, aside from centralizing the VPN setup so you don't screw it up is that it's trivial to connect any device to the VPN. Just join the relevant wifi address! Boom I'm now in a VPN to Australia from any device without messing around setting up that device specifically because I connected to the 'Australia' wifi. I do this with multiple old routers but I actually think there's probably a market for a single home router that vpns to multiple locations in the world with a different wifi network for each of those just for the sake of easily having your TV/Roku/iPad appearing to be from somewhere else trivially. reply CommitSyn 11 hours agorootparentIs there a simple DIY? Is it as simple as running a custom router firmware or software on a small mini PC? Last I looked into this a couple years ago, it basically wasn't possible to chain multiple VPN providers on the same machine, even using VPNs, but maybe I'm misremembering. You could of course just use the built-in VPN connection of your router, but that lacks all the benefits of updated software/firewall, and I want my family to be able to watch Netflix, browse the web without running a CAPTCHAthon, etc. reply madars 5 hours agorootparenthttps://kiljan.org/2021/12/14/vpn-as-wan-for-guest-network-o... is a great start for how to set up a WiFi network with an always-on VPN reply varenc 4 hours agoparentprevThe attack is only possible when you have untrusted devices on your local LAN. If you’re already bringing your own gateway with a VPN on it then I’m guessing untrusted LAN devices aren’t much of a concern. But if you did have something untrusted on your LAN and you’re using DHCP, then that untrusted device could snoop your unencrypted* traffic with this trick, albeit it couldn’t find your real IP since your gateway is concealing that. The attack seems most feasible in a coffee shop wifi situation, where you’re unlikely to be bringing your own router. *by “unencrypted traffic” I mean traffic that’s not encapsulated for transport to your VPN provider. Most everything is HTTPS nowadays so the contents of that traffic would still be encrypted of course. reply wolverine876 11 hours agoparentprevIf you could list some hardware and software, it would save us the effort ... reply Aloisius 11 hours agoparentprevI'd imagine most travel routers are still vulnerable to this. reply ranger_danger 5 hours agoprevGood thing I don't use DHCP. reply ls612 12 hours agoprevSo for this attack does the attacker need to control your internet router? Or does it only need to control ISP infrastructure? reply yjftsjthsd-h 12 hours agoparentPretty sure the attacker has to control your DHCP server, which in ex. a home environment is usually the router. reply tinco 11 hours agorootparentNo, the attacker just has to be on the network. When on the network the attacker can deploy various techniques to become the DHCP server. Since it's (relatively) easy to become a DHCP server on a network, it's considered a big deal when the DHCP server can trick you into doing something like in this case decloaking your VPN traffic. reply ls612 11 hours agorootparentWhat is the fix for this vulnerability? Is it the router that needs to get a software update, the VPN client, the OS, or some/all of the above? reply tinco 10 hours agorootparentThe OS needs an extra feature, and then clients need to make use of that feature. There's other workarounds listed in the \"Mitigations\" section of the post. But the problem is basically that everything is working as intended, for example if you disable the \"Option 121\" feature then under certain circumstances you might not have internet connection. Apparently Android devices don't support Option 121 at all, and it makes them unaffected by this vulnerability, but also causes to sometimes not be able to connect to networks. reply morattisec 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is mostly correct, in our POC video we showcase a lab where we go from being an adjacent host on the network to being the DHCP server. We did this by DHCP starving the true DHCP server and hoarding all the leases. Then we serve our own and do not have to compete with the true DHCP. There’s network protections against this such as guest network isolation or switches with DHCP snooping protections. However, those are usually on enterprises and relying on those being in place kind of removes the point of “securing an untrusted network” like many VPN providers claim. reply champtar 7 hours agorootparentYou should play with IPv6, you can bypass IPv6 RA Guard on some switches (including Cisco) https://blog.champtar.fr/VLAN0_LLC_SNAP/, allowing attacks in 'trusted' networks reply lsllc 11 hours agorootparentprevMany networking switches/systems (e.g. UniFi from Ubiquiti) let you enable DHCP Snooping which drops Layer 2 traffic from rogue DHCP servers to prevent this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP_snooping reply champtar 7 hours agorootparentI invite you to not trust blindly L2 security features, anything that use denylist approach can miss some corner cases, have a good read :) https://blog.champtar.fr/VLAN0_LLC_SNAP/ reply formerly_proven 12 hours agoprevtldr DHCP can add routes, so it can add routes for the internal network of a VPN. It’s not obvious to me why this works, because VPNs set metric 1 on their routes, that’s why traffic goes into them regardless of what IP the surrounding network used. DHCP option 121 has no metric field, so it should get a high default metric and shouldn’t have any impact on a VPN with specific routes. If you only “set the default gateway” (0.0.0.0/0 route), then this probably works. But that also seems particularly amateurish, even for enterprise VPN admins. reply Aloisius 12 hours agoparentMore specific routes are higher priority than less specific ones, so 0.0.0.0/1 is chosen over one for 0.0.0.0/0 even with metric 1. reply ikiris 12 hours agoparentprevbecause unless you have matching routes, most specific wins reply acer4666 12 hours agoprevIs there a tl;dr so we don't have to wade through swathes of AI generated text explaining what a network is? reply yjftsjthsd-h 12 hours agoparentAn attacker who controls the DHCP server can give your device more specific routes and this apparently can cause traffic to go over those routes instead of the VPN. So if your VPN says that it's taking traffic for 0.0.0.0/0, and the DHCP server says 0.0.0.0/1 and 1.0.0.0/1 route over 10.1.1.1, then all your traffic gets sent over 10.1.1.1 because those routes are more specific so they \"win\".

The host's routing table contains at least these fields: A) destination (IP or subnet) B) gateway (aka route, aka next hop) C) interface The article says that when the route is set using DHCP Option 21, the interface field is set to the interface on which the DHCP response was received. So, if I've understood the article correctly, even if the route/gateway address is correct and not malicious, the host will send out packets for that destination via the regular (wifi or ethernet) interface, instead of the VPN interface. Imagine a coffee shop scenario: a malicious DHCP server responds to your DHCP request. It includes Option 121, making certain traffic go to the 10.0.0.1 (the coffee shop router address). Now, even though that gateway isn't malicious, the fact that the traffic is now going over the wifi interface instead of VPN, means someone can snoop on it. reply sixothree 12 hours agorootparentprevWill static IP and gateway alleviate this threat?

Even a single packet is enough for your VPN to be worth nothing. In Ubuntu, it required setting up elaborate firewall rules and activate them after you get a stable VPN connection to avoid this.

At the height of the youth vaping crisis, when many public health experts were calling for sweeping action that could upend the entire industry, David Abrams and Ray Niaura emerged as two authoritative voices willing to defend vaping — despite its growing popularity among youth — as an effective public health strategy to help adults cut back or quit smoking. advertisement Abrams, a frequent commentator about vaping in the news media, including CBS This Morning, CNN, and The New Yorker, coordinated extensively with Juul on public messaging in 2017 and 2018, according to company emails. Abrams asked Juul officials for talking points, allowed company executives to review an academic article prior to publishing, and attended Juul scientific advisory board meetings, all without disclosing those connections to journal publishers or the public.

Juul e-cigarettes came out in 2015; 2018 had the first consent decree to not advertise anywhere kids might see the advertisements; by 2021, we had the first attempt to ban Juul from selling products in the US, period (something which never happened with cigarettes!). The current crop of lawsuits isn't at $200 billion, though, only a few billion. But for a product segment that existed for less than a decade, that's a pretty steep penalty. reply retrac 18 hours agorootparentWe had a minor scandal here in Canada. The same company behind Vuse vapes (Imperial Tobacco of Canada) got approval for an oral product that falls in the same category as nicotine gum, legally. Not heavily controlled. The regulators had apparently never considered that someone might try to market nicotine gum to children who do not use any nicotine products. It was approved as normal, just another off-brand nicotine replacement. To quote the Health Minister, \"We were duped.\" Within a few months in most provinces, orders in council had been drafted to ban the advertising, and prohibit flavours except mint, and there may now be amendments to the laws federally to go further. The slow bureaucratic march to patch the loophole began as soon as it was recognized, basically. Still, the brazenness is stunning. It's the same mentality behind the marketing of the vapes. https://globalnews.ca/news/10142796/health-minister-nicotine... https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nicotine-pouches-regulation... reply ryandrake 18 hours agorootparentI always laugh when governments express surprise when companies exploit loopholes in the law.

I think their intent is more along the lines of companies are not human, hence they are immune to discussions of morality. I tend to agree with that. Moralizing corporate entities will not bring us the outcomes we desire because humans are great at creating internal structures to diffuse accountability.

However, the 10% of the time where the model doesn't hold really matters. Companies are made up of humans, and humans aren't just money-robots. Groups of humans don't automatically turn into unfeeling profit-maximizers either. The moments when humans at companies make decisions that aren't purely motivated by short-term profit are significant and can have a large positive impact.

I’m genuinely curious, because isn’t tar and carbon monoxide the dangerous byproduct of smoking, not the nicotine? reply uniqueuid 20 hours agorootparentThere are many studies on the effect of nicotine. I would look for several meta-analyses or umbrella (meta-meta) analyses. Ideally reporting all-cause mortality. Here is one like that: ~500k individuals, vaping has an odds ratio of 1.33 (95% CI = 1.14–1.56) for heart attacks compared to non-smoker/non-vapers. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S01675... [edit] To compare that to caffeine, this study does not see a significant risk increase for coffee drinkers. So it seems that vaping is objectively more harmful: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5940396/ [edit2] And an umbrella review, because I like them a lot: This shows that negative effects of high coffee intake mostly disappear when controlling for smoking.

But TFA is about vaping, and I am referring to that. [edit] Seems that nicotine is not really harmless, even in gum or patches: double the risk of heart palpitations and chest pains, 1.67 the risk of nausea and vomiting, 1.5 times the risk of gastrointestinal complaints, and 1.4 times the risk of insomnia. Of course, if you measure anything this closely with >100k participants in RCTs, it's bound to have a significant effect.

Your links have convinced me I guess vaping/nicotine, while not the worst vice out there, is still a vice lol; so they have their own dangers. reply freedomben 19 hours agorootparentYes, this is the correct position IMHO based on the data. This is an impossibly hard subject because so many people believe it is immoral (either from religious teaching or cultural indoctrination (like D.A.R.E., etc) and many others feel defensive like they need to justify their choices. Both of these are extremely normal human reactions, so they come by it honestly. But vaping/nicotine can be very safe if you don't do it all the time. Occassional usage is fine. Many people naturally really like the nicotine though and have a hard time regulating their intake.

Quitting cigarettes is about as hard as quitting heroin. In contrast, quitting coffee is much, much easier. On a more personal note, when \"The King's Speech\" was in theaters I kept watching people smoke cigarettes on screen, and went out and bought some Drum. (Loose tobacco that comes with rolling papers.) Within a few days I started getting a voice in my head that told me it was \"a good idea to go have a cigarette on the porch once I get out of bed,\" or \"it's a good idea to have a cigarette when you get home.\" It was really creepy, I've never had a substance put ideas in my head 24+ hours after it was out of my system. reply TimTheTinker 19 hours agorootparentNicotine is only addictive when the delivery method causes a concentration/time spike in the bloodstream. Cigarettes, vaping, and gum in particular cause large concentration spikes, but many other delivery mechanisms do not. I've been on nicotine patches for several years (treating ADHD - very effective) and I'm not addicted at all. I still forget and my wife often has to remind me to put on one! There are no reports to the contrary among patch users. In fact, even moderate pipe smoking reportedly isn't addictive - although it certainly is pleasurable (partly due to the nicotine, but mostly due to other compounds in the smoke). Pipe tobacco doesn't have all the additives (and nicotine salts) that cigarettes have; moreover, unlike cigarette smoking, pipe smoking normally does not involve inhalation—all of which smoothes and limits the nicotine blood concentration/time curve significantly compared to cigarettes and vaping, thus eliminating most of the addictive potential.

However, I don't think this says much about the inherent addictiveness of nicotine vs hard drugs, because it seems like the motivation to quit the hard drugs would be much higher. They're far more destructive in the short term, both to health and relationships. reply bayindirh 20 hours agorootparentprev> 3-5 days of migraine-level headaches and nausea...

I've spent years as very heavy coffee and/or tea drinker but I have never been addicted to it, either physically or psychologically.

Never have. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 20 hours agorootparentprevWhy quit coffee if it has health benefits? reply VyseofArcadia 20 hours agorootparentGreat question! A couple of reasons. The simplest is that I dislike being dependent on any substance. A more nuanced reason is that I want to be able to use caffeine as a tool. A cup of coffee is the largest dose of caffeine that I am comfortable taking at any one time. If I already have caffeine tolerance at the level of a daily coffee habit, caffeine has lost much of its utility to me. However, if my tolerance is lower than that, I can really feel it when I do occasionally have use for a cup of coffee (e.g. the day before code freeze.) Currently my caffeine intake is a cup of tea[0]. This is at the level where I don't hate myself if I miss it[1], and I can still use coffee as a tool on occasion. Also, you can pry my tea out of my cold dead hands. [0] Note that how much caffeine a cup of tea has is much more nuanced than \"black vs green\". Cultivar, terroir, steep time are much more important to caffeine levels than how the tea is processed. In fact if anything, green tea cultivars have been shown to have, on average, very slightly more caffeine than black[2]. [1] I feel it, but it's not 3-5 days of migraines [2] Y.

Same here. All my daily coffee drinker friends say coffee has no effect on them. I drink it ~4-6 times a month (when I'm very busy) and I can feel the effects from one cup almost all day. More than two cups actually is quite uncomfortable. reply freedomben 19 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. I would also add that something can simultaneously provide health benefits in one area and costs in others. If the costs outweigh the benefits, quitting makes sense despite the benefits. reply gwbas1c 18 hours agorootparentprevInsomnia: Sometimes I'm still wired at midnight from the 1 cup from my Kerrig at 8AM. I get weird swings in my caffeine tolerance, so I only consume caffeine 1-2 times a week, or less. Caffeine can also cause weird mood swings.

I’m skeptical of the alleged health benefits from coffee but at least it’s unlikely they come from caffeine itself. reply zeroonetwothree 19 hours agorootparentprevIt must depend on the person. I used to smoke and drink coffee and it was much easier for me to quit smoking. I just stopped one day (12 years ago) and never looked back. In contrast quitting caffeine took me several tries and I had to very carefully taper over the course of months to eventually be able to do it. I also quit alcohol and that was pretty easy too. I used to drink every day and then I stopped without much trouble. reply freedomben 19 hours agorootparentDefinitely depends on the person. I've heard from many people very similar to you. For me, I quit dipping twenty years ago, and I still get occasional cravings for it, especially right after a meal (which is when I used to dip). It was heavenly, but damn I'm guessing my two-year light habit (one to two dips per day at most, and several days without at times) is going to leave me scarred for a lifetime. Though to be fair, it may not have been the nicotine. It's definitely psychological for me. reply xxr 18 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I think this is one of those things where there can be pretty wild deviation from the mean. One of my uncles quit a 30-year smoking habit about 10 years ago, and the only reason he waited so long was because he had heard for decades how hard it is to quit. However, like you he just stopped one day and that was it. (My family credits his success in nicotine cessation to having previously kicked a 20-year heroin addiction. It would be interesting to see if you can “get good” at overcoming addictions, or if every substance is different for every person.) reply pram 17 hours agorootparentI stopped smoking cold turkey in 2013 and it wasn’t very hard, but I’ve never moved beyond the feeling of wanting to smoke. It definitely does something to your brain permanently. reply alphazard 20 hours agorootparentprevReally nothing; you're correct to think of it in the same category as caffeine. Both addictive, yet safe. But vaporizers have more than nicotine. There's other chemicals needed to produce vaporizer fluid, and it's far too soon to tell if they are safe. Even though most of them have been in the food supply, they haven't been inhaled at scale. We already found one that wasn't safe (Vitamin E Acetate), because it was causing very obvious problems.

You can reset caffeine tolerance and dependence in 10 days. reply madog 20 hours agorootparentActually with vaping it becomes pretty easy to quit. You just taper down the nicotine slowly until you're on nothing and eventually you just kind of stop because you don't feel the need to do it anymore. reply bayindirh 20 hours agorootparentWhat about body's response? Is it easy to curb? I was drinking 2 liters of coffee per day while finishing my Ph.D.. Next week I wasn't drinking, and after that I occasionally drank half a cup per day. This was seven years ago, and I still drink half a cup, because I like the taste of coffee. I have at least a dozen vaping friends who said they started to stop smoking. Now at least half of them have heavily souped up, customized e-cigs. Two of them are making their own liquids with nicotine, rest are using bog-standard vapes. None of them stopped smoking or nicotine intake, which was the goal of all of them. reply zachturn 20 hours agorootparentThis is such an edge case on quitting a caffeine addiction. 2 liters is an INSANE amount of coffee to be drinking daily. Kudos to you but let's not pretend this is the average experience of people breaking even much milder levels of caffeine consumption. reply bayindirh 20 hours agorootparentI did my research before letting coffee loose on my body. The coffee acts by blocking tiredness/sleep receptors on the brain, so brain builds more of them to work normally. This is how coffee dependence and tolerance builds. When you stop coffee, brain detects that the number of receptors is too high and starts to break them down. This is why you get the headaches. That \"one week\" period is not an edge case, it's the science of it. If it was proved to be harder on that research, I'd never let my body to reach 2L/day levels. reply itsoktocry 19 hours agorootparent>I did my research before letting coffee loose on my body.

I was unable to find the original papers I read at that time (i.e. 7 years ago!), but found the video which brought me to the entrance of the rabbit hole. - The base video I have talked about is from TedED. It's here [0]. - This study was done on rats in 1985 but verifies that caffeine tolerance is real [1]. - Another controlled study on humans about caffeine tolerance [2] involved one group taking caffeine and the others taking a placebo. Caffeine drinkers taking the placebo reported withdrawal symptoms, and non-drinkers taking caffeine reported overstimulation. - A meta-study [3] details the symptoms and durations of caffeine withdrawal's effects. The paper cites that effects persist between 2 to 9 days, and the peak of the syndrome is around 20 to 51 hours. It also notes that caffeine introduction during this phase alleviates symptoms (This study basically confirms that what I have gone through after I stopped drinking coffee as I noted in a previous comment). - This interesting study [4] explores the body's caffeine response via blood pressure change. Subjects are administered high doses of caffeine, and blood pressure is monitored. After day three, the blood pressure normalizes, and spikes disappear. The abstinence required to reset the pressure response is less than three weeks, pointing that the body resets caffeine tolerance in less than three weeks. If you need the papers, or want more resources, please let me know. Have a nice day.

Rich people taking up sports and eating in moderation is a WASP thing. It’s much less of a thing in the south.

Swedes aren't WASPs, but we are this way. I think Spanish people and Germans are too. I agree that it is as you say in India, but surely both Indian-Americans and Asian-American must become a bit this other way, since they'll probably work with many WASPs, and surely they get affected by media and general societal expectations? reply rayiner 11 hours agorootparentI was talking about American subgroups. The moralizing around sports and exercise tends to be a WASP thing (which refers specifically to northeastern WASPs, not anyone who fits the literal definition of the term). Among Asian Americans it depends on where you are—they tend to assimilate into the local culture. My point is that suggesting that people who eat and gain weight must be unhappy and coping, because happy rich people play sports, is a culturally based assumption. American WASPs and Northern Europeans absolutely stand out in that respect. Even in East Asian cultures with strong social pressure to not gain weight, adults playing sports isn’t common. reply itsoktocry 19 hours agorootparentprev>The shoving of high-fructose corn syrup and other calorie-rich ingredients into everything sold in the US to increase consumption (again, for profits) Do you have any evidence of this conspiracy?

Humans like sweet foods because with the exception of felids, pretty much every species on the planet gains a survival advantage by consuming as many calories as possible when eating. This means that our brains feel rewarded when we eat sugary foods, and rewarded behavior is repeated behavior. That wasn't a problem when such foods were rare but now that they're available pretty much anywhere on-demand, yeah, it's a problem. Personal accountability can only go so far when you're shown ads for sugary cereals and candy every morning as a kid. Contrast that with, say, the current marijuana market in my region. It's regulated, it's only available at a relatively high price from licensed dispensaries. There are billboards but not much in the way of TV or radio ads. It's not marketed to kids.

But the secret is that this is just 100% normal weed. There’s literally not a single thing different about “THC-A weed” vs. “Amsterdam” or “California” weed. THC-A is just the natural form of good old delta-9 THC while the plant is still freshly harvested and unheated. THC-A is the natural, standard weed chemical that converts to “good old delta-9 THC” at 100% efficiency as soon as the weed is heated for consumption, or while the plant sits around in storage for a long time. The old laws counted THC-A as contributing to delta-9 THC content, you summed them together or converted them before testing to decide if it was hemp. Now it’s treated as a different cannabinoid and only delta-9 content determines if it is hemp or weed. So yes, weed is now legal nationwide is the USA, and sold in brick-and-mortar stores in all 50 states…it’s just gone completely and utterly under-the-political-radar.

As you acknowledge, the federal government isn’t enforcing the federal law. To people in states where it’s been legalized, the federal law is a legal technicality. I had to remind my Oregonian in-laws not to bring weed on the plane recently because they forgot that they’d be in federal jurisdiction passing through the airport. (Their logic was it’s legal in Oregon and legal in Maryland…) My point is that the legal and cultural barriers that kept young adults from heading down to their local dispensary to buy dope have disappeared. So while we were on the cusp of freeing people from smoking in the 1990s, we have just made it easy and effectively legal to smoke a different thing, and everyone seems to have forgotten that inhaling smoke into your lungs is bad for you. reply margalabargala 18 hours agorootparentprevLots of things that are de jure illegal are de facto legal. In many US States, marijuana meets this description. To claim \"marijuana absolutely isn't legalized\" is completely incorrect.

The fact that marijuana isn't legal in all states, or is illegal at the federal level, is immaterial to my point. In the places where my family and I live (D.C. and Oregon), marijuana has been legal for a decade. It was made legal in Oregon in 2015, after being decriminalized in 1973. Dispensaries are all over the place. In D.C. it's been legal to grew, possess, and barter since 2015. The fact that it's illegal under federal law has no effect on people's use of it, because the feds do not bother to enforce that law on individuals.

For example, a Canadian study done after a year of legalization found that more youths tried marijuana, but that they were trying it later than average and the overall usage of cannabis among youth remained the same.

Other class 3 drugs include e.g., ketamine, a weird amphetamine (benzphetamine), and some drugs with the opioid codeine. None of these are legalized for recreational use.

We'd joke about our peers that willingly took on an addiction when our generation was mostly in the clear from being addicted to cigarettes. Then some of my friends who'd joke about it started vaping. I don't even know how they started, but they did. Let me be clear - it's not nearly as annoying or destructive for passer-bys as cigarettes. It's been eight-ish years and they still vape. They've tried to stop at points, but it never stuck. Juul is gone, but now there are these $15-25 disposable vapes. I'm not sure if there's a specific term for theses, but they don't even have pods of nicotine that you swap out. You just toss the entire thing. So now an incredible amount of my peers are addicted to nicotine while also producing an incredible amount of e-waste. Juul really helped push this into the mainstream for Gen Z, but the torch is being carried more consistently than ever. I don't even know if some of them are technically legal to sell in my state. The thing that gets me is that we were so close to not having any casual nicotine in my generation. Now there's also a company called \"Zyn\" that is essentially tobacco-less dip. Whatever. I'll go back to complaining about the sports betting phenomenon now. reply Workaccount2 19 hours agoparentI was a smoker, turned vaper, turned quitter. Smoked for 8 years, vaped for 7, quit now for 4. I purposely never picked up on juuls, because they were too good. I worked at a restaurant at the time and begged the younger kids not to pick up a juul because it was clear they were incredibly addictive with none of the restraints of cigarette (can't stealth smoke inside, tastes gross, etc). reply dogman144 18 hours agorootparentI used to dip and quit cold turkey, and had a similar thought when this all came out. Felt deep concern that an amazingly addicting habit suddenly had all its moats removed - tastes like dirt, makes you a bit sick first few times, and then if you got through that the worst/best addition you ever had was waiting for you. Same with Zyn. Now kids and otherwise new smokers get to skip right to the last part. I saw my friends get into it this way and couldn’t say much else than offering to be there when they wanted to quit a few deeply addicted years later. reply kredd 17 hours agoparentprevI was just discussing the whole Zyn craze that’s going with some friends, and it’s amazing to see in real time how it’s becoming so popular. It’s something I have absolutely no desire to try, but looks like influencers, unfortunately, have a lot of pull nowadays. Big names are getting paid to do some product placements, which eventually makes the younger people to get on board with it. Kids want to try new things, but the only “new things” we’ve come up with in the recent years are reintroduction of sports gambling, vaping, nicotine gums and new flavour of social media websites that tend to be more addictive. reply rozab 17 hours agorootparentI don't know if this is the same company, but this thing called Nordic Spirit is being heavily marketed in the UK. It's just snus, changed just enough to get past the 1992 ban on oral tobacco products. About half of my YT adverts are for it right now, and I have never used nicotine products so clearly they are not targeting existing users. It makes me so uneasy because this sort of advertising has been illegal in the UK for as long as I can remember, and they have managed to skirt around the rules so easily. reply walthamstow 16 hours agoparentprevThese disposable vapes have been huge in the UK for a couple of years now, they're just £5 each.

That's a good point for those who already smoked cigarettes, but I'm mainly thinking of the people that jumped into vaping to start and didn't use it as a transition off of cigarettes. The majority of my peers that vape never smoked cigarettes, or started casually smoking cigarettes _after_ they started vaping. The data here [0] seems to support this.

I think you're digging to deep into my phrasing. The majority of people I know that vape would prefer if they didn't. They always talk about trying to quit, but how it's very hard for them. Maybe that doesn't apply to the people you know. They don't like that they have an addiction now. Nicotine has some benefits, but it doesn't seem worth the cost for the majority of ways it's delivered. At no point do I think that we should \"bar\" nicotine use, but I think it's a safe bet to say that most people who have this addiction now would rather not have the addiction. I had a similar response to a comment I made about sports betting and how my peers have gotten very into it and are losing money and forming compulsions. They are free individuals and can do what they want, but I still think it's a generally bad thing to introduce dangerous addictions to more people. I also think that alcohol is generally bad for you too. I don't think that should be banned either, but, generally speaking, most people would live healthier lives without it.

The latter isn't much like OG mango, fair warning, but you'll probably like it if you were a fan of the old school.

Nicotine addiction owned my life for years. Nothing like it. I still have dreams about relapsing dip and then saying “f-it” and spending a day in my dreams going wild with Cope. Quitting meant trying to taper, trying the gum, trying pouches vs loose dip, and if vapes were around I’d prob have tried those too. All that adds up to is you’re still addicted, just to a different form, and your day shifts when leaving the house from “keys, wallet, tin of dip, spitter bottle” to “keys, wallet, nicotine gum/vape/we.” You’re still owned by the chemical haha. Only thing that worked for me and others I knew who quit for good was cold turkey and an awful 90 days, at which point the habit and the chemicals are basically broken. Which brings me to my point: The amount of free marketing Juul and co is getting in this thread from nicotine addicts and their supporters over how Juul is fine and much much different from the good ol’ American diet cigs and dip is disappointing and not surprising.

If so, sounds like we shouldn't be relying on such a method as a source of truth for policy making, or at least treating it with much more skepticism. Are we perhaps using science to inform policy makers before there are multiple independent replications which would make an instance of ethical disregard less likely to influence the outcome? Hiding things, even by omission, is not acceptable. But think of it like a CI/CD system where a junior dev takes down prod. No matter what mistake they made, no matter why they made the mistake, the system shouldn't be so weak that their mistake caused any significant issues.

Case in point: CoreWeave, the GPU infrastructure provider that began life as a cryptocurrency mining operation, this week raised $1.1 billion in new funding from investors, including Coatue, Fidelity and Altimeter Capital. The round brings its valuation to $19 billion post-money and its total raised to $5 billion in debt and equity — a remarkable figure for a company that’s less than 10 years old. It’s not just CoreWeave. Lambda Labs, which also offers an array of cloud-hosted GPU instances, in early April secured a “special purpose financing vehicle” of up to $500 million, months after closing a $320 million Series C round. The nonprofit Voltage Park, backed by crypto billionaire Jed McCaleb, last October announced that it’s investing $500 million in GPU-backed data centers. And Together AI, a cloud GPU host that also conducts generative AI research, in March landed $106 million in a Salesforce-led round. So why all the enthusiasm for — and cash pouring into — the alternative cloud space? The answer, as you might expect, is generative AI. As the generative AI boom times continue, so does the demand for the hardware to run and train generative AI models at scale. GPUs, architecturally, are the logical choice for training, fine-tuning and running models because they contain thousands of cores that can work in parallel to perform the linear algebra equations that make up generative models. But installing GPUs is expensive. So most devs and organizations turn to the cloud instead. Incumbents in the cloud computing space — Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure — offer no shortage of GPU and specialty hardware instances optimized for generative AI workloads. But for at least some models and projects, alternative clouds can end up being cheaper — and delivering better availability. On CoreWeave, renting an Nvidia A100 40GB — one popular choice for model training and inferencing — costs $2.46 per hour, which works out to $1,771 per month. On Azure, the same GPU costs $3.40 per hour, or $2,448 per month; on Google Cloud, it’s $3.67 per hour, or $2,642 per month. (Prices were taken from this chart, which admittedly doesn’t account for all instance types, contracting options and volume discounts.) Given generative AI workloads are usually performed on clusters of GPUs, the cost deltas quickly grow. “Companies like CoreWeave participate in a market we call specialty ‘GPU as a service’ cloud providers,” Sid Nag, VP of cloud services and technologies at Gartner, told TechCrunch. “Given the high demand for GPUs, they offers an alternate to the hyperscalers, where they’ve taken Nvidia GPUs and provided another route to market and access to those GPUs.” Nag points out that even some Big Tech firms have begun to lean on alternative cloud providers as they run up against compute capacity challenges. Last June, CNBC reported that Microsoft had signed a multi-billion-dollar deal with CoreWeave to ensure that OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and a close Microsoft partner, would have adequate compute power to train its generative AI models. Nvidia, the furnisher of the bulk of CoreWeave’s chips, sees this as a desirable trend, perhaps for leverage reasons; it’s said to have given some alternative cloud providers preferential access to its GPUs. Lee Sustar, principal analyst at Forrester, sees cloud vendors like CoreWeave succeeding in part because they don’t have the infrastructure “baggage” that incumbent providers have to deal with. “Given hyperscaler dominance of the overall public cloud market, which demands vast investments in infrastructure and range of services that make little or no revenue, challengers like CoreWeave have an opportunity to succeed with a focus on premium AI services without the burden of hyperscaler-level investments overall,” he said. But is this growth sustainable? Sustar has his doubts. He believes that alternative cloud providers’ expansion will be conditioned by whether they can continue to bring GPUs online in high volume, and offer them at competitively low prices. Competing on pricing might become challenging down the line as incumbents like Google, Microsoft and AWS ramp up investments in custom hardware to run and train models. Google offers its TPUs; Microsoft recently unveiled two custom chips, Azure Maia and Azure Cobalt; and AWS has Trainium, Inferentia and Graviton. “Hyperscalers will leverage their custom silicon to mitigate their dependencies on Nvidia, while Nvidia will look to CoreWeave and other GPU-centric AI clouds,” Sustar said. Then there’s the fact that, while many generative AI workloads run best on GPUs, not all workloads need them — particularly if they’re aren’t time-sensitive. CPUs can run the necessary calculations, but typically slower than GPUs and custom hardware. More existentially, there’s a threat that the generative AI bubble will burst, which would leave providers with mounds of GPUs and not nearly enough customers demanding them. But the future looks rosy in the short-term, say Sustar and Nag, both of whom are expecting a steady stream of upstart clouds. “GPU-oriented cloud startups will give [incumbents] plenty of competition, especially among customers who are already multi-cloud and can handle the complexity of management, security, risk and compliance across multiple clouds,” Sustar said. “Those sorts of cloud customers are comfortable trying out a new AI cloud if it has credible leadership, solid financial backing and GPUs with no wait times.” Please login to comment Login / Create Account TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 Innovation For Every Stage LEARN MORE Sign up for Newsletters See all newsletters(opens in a new window) Daily News Week in Review Startups Weekly Event Updates Advertising Updates By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy.

We accidentally ran up a rather large bill because while the EFS storage pricing was simple enough, the usage pricing bit us. It seems like AWS' entire business model is making the pricing so confusing that you don't know what it will cost until after you've used it. It feels weirdly similar to the US healthcare/insurance situation. More competition in this space can only be a good thing. reply superfrank 15 hours agoparent> It seems like AWS' entire business model is making the pricing so confusing that you don't know what it will cost until after you've used it. Maybe I'm naive, but I don't think that's intentional. I think it's just a byproduct of trying to build something that works for everyone and every use case. As you make your target market bigger and bigger, you continually hit edge case after edge case that you try and solve with \"just one more\" rule or option. Eventually the system becomes so complex that no layman can understand it. reply tjoff 15 hours agorootparentThat would make some sense if the edge-cases didnt have 10.000% margin. reply superfrank 14 hours agorootparentI've worked at companies that were spending 6 figures a month on AWS and we had dedicated AWS employees who helped us understand our bill and keep pricing in check. We also had GCP and Azure reps constantly reaching out to see if they could win us over by showing us how they could lower our bill. Overcharging enterprise customers for things they're not using is actually a risk to AWS as it gives customers a reason to jump ship. The whales on AWS aren't overspending because AWS uses the granularity of their billing to make sure they aren't. That's how they keep the whales happy. For the little guys, I'm not even sure it's worth AWS's time to nickel and dime them. AWS hands out thousands to ten of thousands of dollars in credits like candy. I'm pretty sure it's more important to them to lock in whales when they're still minnows than to bilk an extra $500 a year out of a 10 person start up. reply Hikikomori 13 hours agorootparentIdk about that, it becomes worse at larger scales.

So the issue here is not really shared vs dedicated instances. The issue here is that a particular cloud provider (namely AWS) has set up an opaque fee structure. reply ElevenLathe 15 hours agorootparentIn my experience, when people say \"dedicated server\" they typically mean something like OVH rather than a real \"cloud\" provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.). In other words, something morally equivalent to colo but without having to ship servers around. reply baobabKoodaa 15 hours agorootparentYes, that is likely the case here as well. But if someone is not well versed in cloud providers and reads these comments, they might be misinformed without clarifying that this issue is AWS vs other providers, as opposed to dedicated vs shared resources. reply drdaeman 15 hours agorootparentprev> If you rent a dedicated server from AWS Who, in their right mind, goes for a bare metal to AWS, when there are so many decent and time-tested options out there? reply jedberg 15 hours agorootparentData Gravity.

The original comment was talking about a dedicated machine for personal projects with a fixed cost of $40/month. reply oooyay 7 hours agorootparentprevGenerally you get a \"dedicated host\" from AWS, not a \"dedicated server\" so that was kind of my first tip off. There's a very big difference; the only usecase I'd really consider for dedicated hosts is security related and, frankly, they're far more expensive than any colo box. Dedicated Hosts are also far more restrictive than what you get at a colo DC. Second, even if AWS offered to let you have full control of a rack box you'd have to be economically out of your mind with AWS' network costs compared to a colo DC. reply whiplash451 14 hours agorootparentprevYou still have network performance limitations + the security aspects to run by yourself (as in: not getting your data drive encrypted by a ransomware) reply oooyay 9 hours agorootparentI probably wasn't explicit enough with \"cloud\" but I mean running your own isolated workloads with at minimum virtual machines and virtual isolated storage (block or otherwise).

Sure, it's not beefy at that price: an Atom N2800 with 4 GB or RAM but it is a dedicated server with its own IPv4 IP (yup, there can be uses for that). I mostly use it as a jump host / reverse-ssh-with-a-known-fixed-IP thinggy. They've got great dedicated servers at very good price and they're not the only ones in that space. These can be rebooted/reinstalled remotely and they're monitored: OVH shall deal with hardware failure, if any, for you (never had any so far). reply toast0 14 hours agorootparentprevI've got a dedicated machine for $30/month. It's ancient, a xeon L5640 with 16 GB ram, and 1 TB spinning disk, but it's dedicated and it works great. Well actually, the first one stopped working well, and I got a replacement with double those specs for the same price; and the second one is working great. I also run with full disk encryption, because I don't trust their opsec on wiping drives, so that's a bit of a hassle to reboots, I have to get a console with IPMI and put in the disk password, although I saw something [1] last night that inspires me to consider the possibility of automation.

Preventing deceptive practices in a market economy this is a prime example of useful government \"intervention\", just like supporting contract enforcement or preventing theft reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentThey can always justify it as not knowing the price. The sales tax rate is different in different places. It costs a different amount to ship to Florida than Alaska and picking it up at the factory is free (even if nobody does). The advertised price is if you have your own modem, renting one from the cable company is more. None of these are inherently wrong. You should be paying more if you're having it shipped to a remote location with high shipping costs, and the cost of that shouldn't be dumped on every other customer. But it's kind of a loophole if you want the advertised price to be lower than what people are actually going to be paying in practice. reply wongarsu 12 hours agorootparentThere are some cases where not knowing the price is reasonable. As you say, shipping can often only be calculated if you know all items and their destination. If you advertise on national TV you can't name a price that includes sales price (unless the company eats the difference). But these could be treated as tightly regulated necessary evils, not as a justification that showing final prices is always impossible. There is no reason you can't show final price including tax on the label in a physical shop. There is no reason why a restaurant should be able to charge a 20% service charge instead of increasing regular prices by 20%. If you are buying a concert ticket or airline ticket the displayed price should include all mandatory fees. They can upsell you on additional services, but they can't suddenly notice in the last checkout step that your price is higher because the website you are using is charging a fee; that fee was known to them at the beginning of the transaction and should have to be disclosed at that point in time at the latest. If you want to go even further you can also dictate that shipping and handling fees are only allowed to include reasonable costs of actual shipping and handling. All of these are normal common-sense regulations in most first-world countries. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparent> There is no reason you can't show final price including tax on the label in a physical shop. Sure there is. When the price label is affixed by the factory/warehouse then you would have to track where everything is going and be unable to share inventory. Also, if the sales tax rate changes then all the labels become wrong. These would ultimately increase costs for consumers. Adding sales tax is also not at all misleading because the customer is not going to be surprised by it and there isn't going to be a competing merchant across the street who can avoid charging it. There are also business customers with their own sales tax ID and they can buy things without paying sales tax when they're being incorporated into a product where they collect the sales tax themselves. > There is no reason why a restaurant should be able to charge a 20% service charge instead of increasing regular prices by 20%. This is actually true. A mandatory undisclosed fee is BS. But it doesn't help much, because if they want to do it then they just make it \"optional\" where the way to avoid it is more of an inconvenience than paying the fee. > They can upsell you on additional services, but they can't suddenly notice in the last checkout step that your price is higher because the website you are using is charging a fee; that fee was known to them at the beginning of the transaction and should have to be disclosed at that point in time at the latest. The last step is where you disclose your address. Before that they may not even know which country you're in, much less the city/state, and there are a thousand legitimate reasons to have different prices or fees in different jurisdictions. > If you want to go even further you can also dictate that shipping and handling fees are only allowed to include reasonable costs of actual shipping and handling. That doesn't really help, they're typically charging the actual cost. They just don't include it in the advertised price because it makes you inclined to make the purchase online instead of saving $10 by picking it up for the same price but no shipping charge the next time you go to the competing local store. There's a reason Amazon's major competitive advantage is free two day shipping, derived from having the scale to achieve low shipping costs themselves. reply cogman10 12 hours agorootparent> When the price label is affixed by the factory/warehouse then you would have to track where everything is going and be unable to share inventory. Price tags are pretty much universally handled at the stores. There are some goods where the price tag is attached, but that's more the exception and not the rule. This is a solvable problem.

Which is basically what they do now. You see the final price at the register before you pay. You also know that there is going to be sales tax, no one is being misled. Putting a different price on the tags than there is on the ad would just confuse people and make it harder to tell when you're not getting the advertised price because you have to do fractional arithmetic on every soup can and candy bar to see if it matches. ryandrake 9 hours agorootparentprevYep, this is one of those \"This problem can't be solved - Says the only nation that has this problem\" situations. reply thaumaturgy 14 hours agorootparentprevI have begun to think of this as a \"large population error\", and I'm noticing it in a lot of different markets. At small scales, annoying your customers is bad business. You only need to lose a few before it begins to hurt. Customer complaints are more likely to be a consideration in business decisions. At larger scales, a business can begin to preferentially adopt practices intended to drive away some customers. Perhaps you don't want the \"pathological\" customers, to borrow one of Patrick McKenzie's terms. You can make more money with less effort by being more selective about your customers. At extremely large scales, you largely stop thinking about groups of customers altogether. All of your decisions are driven by aggregates -- did all sales go up this quarter, or down? The effort required to do a deep dive into the behaviors and preferences of any individual market segment may not make sense anymore on a quarterly basis. At this scale, you might be able to afford to annoy tens of thousands of customers and still have a very nice graph next quarter. So, when someone says a business practice shouldn't be \"tolerated\", that's a perfectly reasonable position, except it doesn't actually work for businesses operating at extremely large scales. It's too difficult for customers to organize a protest in a way that will influence that business's decision-making. So much business has moved online in the last 20 years, while the US has leveled off at 80% urbanization over the same time period, along with more and more businesses congealing into BigCos, combined with the recent domination of private equity: lots and lots of things are now operating at a scale where customer concerns just aren't a part of the business model anymore. Coffee shops, fast food, big-box retail, online retail, SaaS, PaaS: all of these can thrive while running on exorbitant pricing and abusive customer policies, because their volume of customers is so large that it's nearly impossible to be so bad that you'll piss off enough customers to impact your decision-making. (Unless you're Sony.) reply staunton 13 hours agorootparent> It's too difficult for customers to organize a protest in a way that will influence that business's decision-making.

The problem in my mind is that the largest companies have too much efficiencies of scale to compete with on price. When competition can't undercut on price, it is hard to argue that customers aren't being served by monopoly mega corps. reply thaumaturgy 9 hours agorootparentYeah, this is a pretty standard answer to the same market failures that so many people have been talking about recently. It assumes though that low prices are the best possible benefit consumers might get from competition, and it also assumes that megacorps necessarily lead to the lowest possible prices for consumers. Chokepoint Capitalism is a pretty okay book that kicks the legs out from under both assumptions. reply s1artibartfast 7 hours agorootparentI don't think I'm making any assumptions about what's best.

Assuming the care you need can be entirely performed within the ER, then that's a viable strategy so long as you don't intend to re-visit the hospital. Hospitals are obligated to provide care regardless of your ability to pay in the moment, and of course they often take care of indigent and foreign patients, with the understanding that they won't be able to recoup their costs. If you don't have your identification on you, then they simply give you a number to call and they usually ask to respond within a few business days because after that, it's harder to get insurance approval. This all changes if you're admitted to the hospital and need surgery, because I think there's pre-approval required from your insurance carrier. Though since I worked in the ER, my memory is hazy on that. If they believe you were deceptive and simply refused to be identified, then that is technically illegal, so they will put up your picture and will alert the police if they see you again. But if you never intend to visit the hospital again, it doesn't really matter. No one is going to hunt you down unless you're doing it on such a large scale that it can't be ignored. This all said, I want to say that I still think it's an unethical thing to do. reply explaininjs 13 hours agorootparentI have a friend that incurred massive medical debts in college when their (college-provided) insurance refused to cover services rendered at the (college) hospital.

The American government spends something approaching a trillion dollars annually on Medicaid, \"a government program that provides health insurance for adults and children with limited income and resources.\"[1] Seperately, Obamacare[2] created a private health insurance market where low income people can obtain free or heavily discounted private health insurance coverage, according to their income.

For example, in Texas, nobody is eligible for Medicaid based solely on their income alone. Where Medicaid is expanded, the income requirements for Medicaid are far from sane. If you make over 100% to 138% of the federal poverty line, which is $15,060/year for an individual, you are not eligible for coverage. For example, someone who makes $16k to $21k a year, depending on where they live, is ineligible for coverage despite making poverty wages. [1] https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/status-o... reply notaustinpowers 13 hours agorootparentprevObamacare is (largely) a failure due to insurance meddling and laws preventing government insurance programs from negotiating prices with drug companies. I'm a healthy individual, not even 30 yet, never smoked, never broken a bone, and never even had stitches in my life. And when I last checked their prices, I was making only $45k/yr. For coverage with Obamacare, I would be paying $350/month for the \"catastrophic\" plan. Which includes no prescription copay, no dental, no vision, and only kicks in after I've spent $100,000 in one year, and it takes 6 months to take effect after signing up. It's only there for serious issues like losing a leg or cancer. reply dangrossman 13 hours agorootparentObamacare is not a plan, it's a law that set minimum standards for health insurance plans, created marketplaces to cross-shop plans across providers on a single website, and created a system where you can receive government subsidies towards their cost if your income is low enough. At $45K, you would receive subsidies towards your insurance premiums. I've bought my insurance on the ACA marketplace since it opened ten years ago. There's no difference I can see between the plans offered on the health insurance marketplace and those offered directly from the websites of the same insurers that offer coverage in my state (Blue Cross, CVS Aetna, United, Ambetter, etc). The very highest deductible \"catastrophic\" plan offered on the marketplace in California for a 29 year old has a $9450/year deductible, which is also the maximum out-of-pocket expense for the year if you have this plan. A $100K deductible plan does not exist, and when you enroll during the annual enrollment period or after a qualifying life event, plans take effect the day you make your first payment, not months later. I'm 10 years your senior and pay less than $350 per month with a lower deductible than the plan quoted above, with no government subsidies. reply notaustinpowers 13 hours agorootparentI use Obamacare in the rural southern way, referencing ACA and healthcare.gov, lol. I'm also in Georgia which may have different regulations regarding the deductibles. I remember looking at the plans around 2 years ago and realizing that there was no way I could afford the premium, let alone the yearly deductible. I just took another quick look at a non-Healthcare.gov site. Insurance for me would be $313/month with a $9,100 deductible. But it does not cover doctor visits, generic drugs, or specialist visits until after I pay the full $9,100. Why would I want to pay $313/month for essentially no coverage until I spend 20% of my income towards a deductible before I see any benefits? reply dangrossman 13 hours agorootparentYou get an annual doctor visit for free with any insurance plan. There is no deductible or copay. There are other categories that are covered with no deductible. My wife had a $13,000 IUD insertion under anesthesia at a hospital due to complications, and this cost her $0 with insurance, without having met her deductible, since reproductive health is covered with no out of pocket cost under all ACA plans. I'm on healthcare.gov looking at Georgia's plans this year for someone with $45K of income. You have options starting at $129/month. Many of these sub-$200 plans get you doctors visits for $40-60, prescription drugs for under $25 each, mental health treatment for under $60 per visit. This is all without hitting your deductible at all, they're day 1 prices. If you paid the cash prices for many of these doctors, specialists, therapists, they'd be many times higher than the insurance negotiated costs. Look under the \"covered costs\" estimates for things like mental health treatment, diabetes maintenance, broken bone treatment, etc and you'll see that the estimated annual cost for the insured is often half or less the plan's deductible -- which tells you that hitting the deductible is not when the savings start. I don't think my wife or I have ever hit our out-of-pocket maximums in a year, yet the insurance has saved us more than it's cost in most years. You're going to start interacting with the healthcare system a lot more than you have in your 20s once you're in your 30s. We all do at that age. And if you have even the worst ACA plan, you'll start to understand what it's doing for you regardless of the deductible. reply phonon 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is the cheapest plan I could find in GA.

(I used https://www.healthsherpa.com/ to more easily check out available plans.) It covers preventative care, and after the $9100 deductible, it seems to cover pretty much everything with $0 copay, as long as its in-network.

Still long before that I basically just said I didn't have insurance and would get the price knocked down considerably. Half the time it's cheaper not to even have insurance... But now I'm \"responsible\" in the hopes it might bring down the price for other things in the future. For planned events I recommend health insurance, despite how often it's not all that worth it. Honestly though my current insurance copay cost as much as being uninsured in other countries so I kinda laugh at this crazy idea.

Of course the number of uninsured residents will be higher than the national average. You didn't control for uninsured per capita. Why are so many uninsured if it's possible (I didn't say easy) for them to get coverage?

There is certainly no mass migration away from the cloud. Yes, I personally saw companies in the 2010s say \"we're moving everything to the cloud!\" without adequate planning or cost analysis and then saying \"OK, everyone off the cloud\" once they got an insane cloud bill. But cloud costs can be managed, and for many, many companies the cost of hiring people to manage all this infrastructure and services is usually way more than a well-managed cloud project. Also, the canonical rationale I see on HN for moving away from the cloud is \"I can just rent a box for $X/month\". If all you're using the cloud for is a dumb, static set of compute, I agree that you can probably do it cheaper on your own. I know hardly any companies (from small startups to large enterprises) who use the cloud that way. reply rco8786 15 hours agorootparent> for many, many companies the cost of hiring people to manage all this infrastructure and services is usually way more than a well-managed cloud project. Yea, this is the line that everyone uses. I've worked at these companies, and the reality just doesn't line up with that. You end up still needing your whole Ops team, they're just building cloud tooling instead of on-prem tooling. As to whether or not the migration away is happening...major cloud providers are already seeing people leave, and profits starting to contract. It's very early. Like I said in the original post, it took us a long time to wind up the cloud and it's going to take a long time to come back to reality. Something roughly cloud-shaped will probably always remain..there are some legit use cases especially for companies that have spiky load profiles.

Even if you take what the surveyed CIOs say at face value, asking \"Are you planning to move some workloads back to private cloud/on-prem from public cloud\" is totally consistent with what I said. There was rush of \"just put everything on the cloud\" without thinking through it strategically.

This is patently not true. AWS is very transparent with the pricing and offers a cost calculator. Specifically for EFS, you could have used the EFS service cost calculator before setting off with your endeavours: https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator/EFS Other services are available at https://calculator.aws/ Any work on any cloud platform has an imperative step: the cost analysis. Once constituents of the solution are finalised (step 1), it is compulsory to proceed to step 2: estimate the charges it is going to cost and decide whether it is affordable or not. Skipping the step 2 and blaming the cloud platform provider business model is not fair and is akin to overspending on a credit card and blaming the credit card issuer for allowing you to do it. Cloud is not dissimilar from UNIX/Linux – both give one a large variety of elaborate footguns to shoot oneself with, and if they worked as root on a software development project on a UNIX/Linux box and accidentally wiped the root file system out, who is to blame?

Finally look at the fine print for your insurance company’s website. You’ll see multiple disclaimers noting that the information may not be accurate - for example from blue cross blue shield: > Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees have made reasonable efforts to ensure that the list of providers displayed is up to date and accurate. Please call the provider before making an appointment to verify that the provider continues to be part of the network. Then when you call the provider to confirm, they shunt you back to your insurance provider. It’s hilarious if it didn’t have significant financial consequences. reply 015a 16 hours agoprevWe're absolutely seeing the same thing even in non-GPU traditional servers. Here is an estimated monthly cost breakdown for a new GCP instance type, the n4-standard-2, in us-central1: 2 vCPU + 8 GB memory: $69.18 10 GB Hyperdisk Balanced: $0.80 3060 provisioned IOPS: $15.30 155 MB/s provisioned throughput: $6.20 Total: $91.48 Like, you can tear apart that $69/mo for 2vCPU + 8gb of memory, no problem. That's utterly insane. Its Emerald Rapids, so you're paying a premium for new chips, whatever. You can also tear apart the network egress, obviously. But just look at the SSD pricing. That's a ten gigabyte SSD provisioned for 155MB/s, for $22/month. You can go just outright buy a 256gb NVME at significantly higher bandwidth on Amazon for like $25, flat. The n4 tier instances removed the ability to use their cheaper general-purpose SSDs; you have to use hyperdisks. I'd be surprised if we don't see the big cloud providers start struggling over the next ten years. I think they engineered planetary-scale systems that are just way too expensive and complex to justify the cost they're charging; ZIRP phenomena. reply phh 15 hours agoparentYou feel like it's new, I don't. I've evaluated migrating from full blown servers to cloud at various scales for various usages: OTA server for 1M active devices, stat server for 1M active devices, build server for Android (both pure Android that parallelizes and checks out super nearly and vendor Android where they broke all of that). In all those cases the cost of cloud was like an order of magnitude costlier. You're mentioning SSD, the various clouds I tried (I couldn't remember which I tried sorry...) had bad storage performance (it was especially bad when building Android). Also not all those servers were maintained by my employer, when we pay top end 100Gbps server we can pay someone to maintain it for us as well for much lower money than the \"cloud tax\". I have no doubt there are great use case for cloud, and that at the proper scale you can negotiate, and I understand that startups might be faster moving with the cloud. But I feel like the highest value cloud provides is 1. replacing capex with opex, and 2. making scaling easier with the direction: cloud is pay first, get questions from direction later. \"on-prem\" is negotiate with the direction until the service degrades and then scramble to integrate the new server under the pressure. reply metadat 9 hours agorootparent> In all those cases the cost of cloud was like an order of magnitude costlier. Don't discount the value-add of your skills. Giving any of my family members a stack of bare metal servers would serve no end-purpose or web requests. Approximately zero of said servers would even end up plugged in at all, much less operationalized. My family all works in tech or similarly demanding fields. That is, the cost of \"the ops team / guy\" can be significant for small and medium enterprises. Despite this, the AWS pricing margins have grown to the point of excess, and are no longer competitive, even against other major cloud players. This is strange to me because the tooling is all interoperable (e.g., Terraform/Vaggi-form), with no fatal friction or lock-in. It is a rare use-case that the latest CPU is worth paying a penny extra for compared to a 3 or 4 generation old chip. The only winner is the cloud provider because it improves their COGS ratio. TL;DR: the top tier clouds are priced on the order of luxury goods, on par with a Bugatti or G6 jet. That is, unless you ruthlessly track and prune each expense, which costs you time and attention which could have been spent growing the business or at least non-overhead tasks. The eventuality of managing your own DIY fleet of machines is a total headache, as any given computer may work flawlessly for the next ten years or only the next 10 minutes. When it goes south, you're back to being a monkey plugging in cables and scratching your head. This sad activity is only a few people's cup of tea.

That is if you rent rack space. If you rent bare metal and the bare metal has a failing disk, you file a request to replace said disk, and the data center engineer will be plugging cables, not you. That means you have to worry about hardware failures, but you don't have the inconvenience of having to be physically present. reply wmf 14 hours agoparentprevHyperdisk is a SAN; it's not comparable to local storage. Unfortunately Google's local SSDs are also overpriced. reply 015a 14 hours agorootparentSure, but you literally cannot use any other kind of SSD with the n4-class instances, and n4 are the only instances they offer on Emerald Rapids; they're advertised as general purpose, flexible, and high performance, basically their workhorses. If you want to use a local SSD you have to use older generation chips. reply candiddevmike 15 hours agoparentprevIMO, the big thing holding back customers (especially smaller ones) from going on-premise these days is networking. Getting a fat pipe similar to what you get with an instance on a cloud provider can be prohibitively expensive (internet service, gear, staff, etc), especially when you want it to be highly available. reply tempest_ 15 hours agorootparentIt is really the second one.

Software is the easy part. Getting HVAC, power and network up to the levels of cloud providers is difficult to get right and prohibitively expensive. For instance, the cost for a pair of redundant symmetric gigabit fiber is in the thousands a month and may require tens of thousands of construction costs. These quickly add up, and the upfront costs can quickly reach six figures. reply amluto 13 hours agorootparentThere’s a huge middle ground between on-prem and GCP/AWS. You can rent space and connectivity from in very competent datacenter without any of these big fixed costs. reply hot_gril 12 hours agorootparentCan rent the space, but you still have to buy the hardware. Maybe there's money to be made running some low-availability cloud service offering newer hardware. reply amluto 11 hours agorootparentHave you checked the price for a system capable of using two redundant 10Gbps links lately? It’s cheap. You could put gear like this in your closet at home and not feel particularly silly about it, especially if you are willing to buy still-current used enterprise gear. For that matter, have you checked the price, in qty 1, of a server that will absolutely destroy anything reasonable from a major cloud vendor in terms of IOPS to stick behind that switch or router? Even if you believe the numbers on the website of a major server vendor and forget to ask for a discount, it’s still quite reasonable in comparison to a major cloud. reply hot_gril 11 hours agorootparentYeah, tends to be. But it's more efficient for multiple customers who don't need the hardware full-time to share it. Someone could set that up without all the expensive HA guarantees and other stuff a regular cloud provides. Maybe was too niche in the past, but now with the AI boom... reply saltminer 14 hours agorootparentprevI remember seeing a quote for 500/500 metro E from Comcast several years ago. $12k to install, $1.2k/mo. And that only involved laying a few miles of fiber, no redundancy. Dedicated lines are no joke. If you're AWS or GCP, you can be your own ISP and mitigate this to some extent, but that's just the physical connection they save on. You can always save by going on-prem, assuming you have no uptime requirements. But the moment you sign an SLA, those savings go out the window. reply bradstewart 13 hours agorootparentprevNot to mention security compliance. If you can afford all of that, seems pretty likely you'll also have SOC2/etc needs. Being able to \"ignore\" the whole physical security aspect of that stuff is a huge benefit of the cloud. reply tempest_ 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah, k3s doesn't buy 2 routers, 2 switches, 2 PDUs, 2 firewalls, 2 proxies to sit in front of k3s, 2 internet connections (if those are offered) etc etc the list goes on. Not to mention that HA things like to come in 3s. Then if you are going to have remember that cloud networking is pretty beefy and if you want k3s to do distributed storage you will need some pretty beefy network hardware. There are a lot of things hidden in the cloud costs that people forget about. The one thing running your own stuff does allow you to do is make choices and trade offs. If this switch goes down and we have 6 hours of downtime to replace it what is that worth etc. reply wmf 13 hours agorootparentprevAre you talking about colo or an office? Because carrier-neutral colos are pre-wired with plenty of bandwidth that's 10x-100x cheaper than public clouds.

In the past, the three big clouds would deploy cutting-edge CPUs at scale ahead of general availability for ordinary rackmount servers. Now? The AMD EPYC 9004 series processors were announced over a year ago in March 2023, but are still trickling out as “preview” in selected regions in Azure. Similarly, Intel Xeon fourth-gen CPUs haven’t even been announced by Azure, but Intel is already shipping fifth-generation CPUs! I suspect that up until a couple of years ago, the usage of public cloud was increasing at such a pace that the providers were buying a truckload of CPUs every six months, so they were keeping up with the latest tech. They must have had new signups dry up as soon as interest rates went up, and they’re now milking their existing kit instead of expanding with new generation servers. reply jeffbee 9 hours agoparentprevThe $22/mo hyperdisk is for customers who want effortless durability.

As a small tech startup, an easy button for compute needs is perfectly sensible, as it allows focusing on the product. If the startup grows switching becomes more expensive, so AWS gets its money as long as the amounts are not seen as the main cost driver. That stage, I think (with no hard data), is the AWS sweetspot. The company is paying a lot for AWS, but does not yet want to do a full analysis, hire dedicated cloud cost optimization staff and deal with friction of switching. If the startup grows stable and profitable it will likely do a proper cost analysis and make AWS bills saner, maybe with a mix of on-prem, AWS and non-AWS cloud services. But that requires a stable period, both in time and in functionality, which is not something that an unprofitable startup has. I think with the end of ZIRP and tighter access to VC funds the number of startups that can afford losing a lot of money to go through an explosive growth period will shrink, and so will the AWS profits. reply claytonjy 14 hours agoprevWhat are folk's experiences with alternative cloud GPUs for inference? If you're doing a lot of model training, buying GPUs or long-term reservations of GPUs is a no-brainer. But when it comes to inference, latency matters and it gets trickier talking between e.g. your AWS infra and your GPUs somewhere else. It seems lots of providers can give you enough to get by doing inference in a company's earliest stages. But what if I need hundreds or thousands of A100s during peak usage? Is anyone doing this successfully with a non-hyperscaler? reply htrp 14 hours agoparentJust go with an inference provider like fireworks/together/modal/baseten reply claytonjy 11 hours agorootparentAn issue we've had when looking into some of these is that, they provide a layer of software abstraction we're not looking for. I don't want to use some providers bespoke library to wrap my model code; I just want to use NVIDIA Triton, either by providing an image or by providing a model repo. I only want the inference provider to handle the hardware. I understand that's exactly what those provider _don't_ want, because it means they can't lock us in. But particularly when comparing an inference provider to GCP, where we already run everything in Triton on GKE, I don't want to rewrite my code just to see what their hardware layer is like. Another complication is we often run multiple tightly-integrated models for a single application, where having them on the same GPU is critical. This is tricky or impossible in some inference-provider-frameworks. There's too many options for running the latest LLM, and far fewer for running a bespoke set of fine-tuned models on GPUs. reply maxchehab 14 hours agoprevBoth Core Weave & Lambda Labs have fairly predatory pricing making it impossible to rent GPUs without a yearly contract.

    "originBody": "Proton Mail Discloses User Data Leading to Arrest in Spain May 6, 2024 By Alex Lekander — 7 Comments Proton Mail has come under scrutiny for its role in a legal request involving the Spanish authorities and a member of the Catalan independence organization, Democratic Tsunami. Proton Mail is a secure email service based in Switzerland, renowned for its commitment to privacy through end-to-end encryption and a strict no-logs policy. In 2021, Proton Mail faced controversy when it complied with a legal request that led to the arrest of a French climate activist. Under Swiss law, Proton Mail was compelled to collect and provide information on the individual’s IP address to Swiss authorities, who then shared it with French police. The recent case involving the Spanish police this time, highlights privacy concerns and the limits of encrypted communication services under national security pretexts, and brings a long-debated subject to the forefront once again. The core of the controversy stems from Proton Mail providing the Spanish police with the recovery email address associated with the Proton Mail account of an individual using the pseudonym ‘Xuxo Rondinaire.’ This individual is suspected of being a member of the Mossos d’Esquadra (Catalonia’s police force) and of using their internal knowledge to assist the Democratic Tsunami movement. Upon receiving the recovery email from Proton Mail, Spanish authorities further requested Apple to provide additional details linked to that email, leading to the identification of the individual. This case is particularly noteworthy because it involves a series of requests across different jurisdictions and companies, highlighting the complex interplay between technology firms, user privacy, and law enforcement. The requests were made under the guise of anti-terrorism laws, despite the primary activities of the Democratic Tsunami involving protests and roadblocks, which raises questions about the proportionality and justification of such measures. Like before, Proton Mail’s compliance with these requests is bound by Swiss law, which mandates cooperation with international legal demands that are formalized through proper channels (Swiss court system). Last year, when we noted that Proton Mail complied with nearly 6,000 data requests in 2022, Proton provided us with an explanation that inbox contents remain secure. Please note that in all cases email content, attachments, files etc are always encrypted and cannot be read. Proton statement to RestorePrivacy last year Looking at Proton’s transparency report, we find that Proton Mail complied with 5,971 data requests last year alone, up slightly from the year before. Proton Mail complied with 5,971 data requests in 2023. With so many data requests going on in the background, it is all the more important to safeguard the data you share with various services. The importance of good OPSEC This situation serves as a critical reminder of the importance of maintaining stringent OPSEC (operational security). One should always be aware of the potential vulnerabilities that come with linking recovery information or secondary services (like Apple accounts) that may not have the same privacy safeguards as a primary encrypted email service. For users concerned about privacy, particularly those involved in sensitive or political activities, OPSEC should be a top concern when using privacy tools. It’s advisable to: Avoid linking recovery emails or phone numbers that can directly tie back to personal identities or primary business activities. Consider using secondary, disposable emails or virtual phone numbers that offer an additional layer of anonymity. Use a good VPN service to hide your IP address whenever possible. (Failure to do this is what compromised a Proton Mail user in France who was arrested after after police obtained IP logs.) Consider purchasing services using an anonymous payment method. Stay informed about the legal obligations and policies of communication service providers, especially regarding their compliance with international law enforcement requests. While Proton Mail and similar services offer substantial protections and end-to-end encryption on their email platform, they are not immune to legal and governmental pressures. Users must navigate these waters carefully, balancing the need for security with the potential legal obligations of their service providers. RestorePrivacy has reached out to Proton Mail for a comment on the case and their exact involvement, but a statement wasn’t immediately available. We will update this article as soon as we hear back.

In this case the email address was the lead, but I wonder what other info would be enough to get the phone provider to spill the beans. For instance would an IP address used at a specific time be uniquely identifying if it was VPNed by Apple at that moment ?

After this incidence, they went on to obtain a court ruling in Switzerland, where they operate, so that this specific attack cannot happen again. In their blog post about it [1], they instruct concerned users to access their account over Tor. Of course when Proton say they don't log, we just have to take their word for it. People who don't want that element of trust can use Tor. Personally I believe their story in this case.

Privacy does not protect you from the state. Privacy is good enough to protect you from the public. If you are doing battle with or an enemy of the state, much less an agent of the state acting in bad faith simple privacy will do nothing for you. Worse your misunderstanding of it is actually a vector, like in this case. The measures for anonymity you require will not incorporate fancy UIs, nice features, or even reasonable reliability at times because they will be sacrificed in the name of leaving no trace. reply dathinab 6 hours agoparentPrivacy is also meant to protect you from the state, or more specifically state abuse. It's an essential aspect of privacy. Like privacy is also meant to e.g. not disclose topics you have communicated about so that it can't be abused against you. For example there is a long history of states persecuting people for idk. being gay, believing in a certain religion or being a journalist which was involved in a unpleasant disclosure. Still privacy and anonymity are two tightly related but different things. Mainly privacy of communication doesn't always imply anonymity, through sometimes does (and has too!). Anyway it is foolish and somewhat strange to believe that a legally operating email service will protect you against judge backed lawful orders (no matter if it should be lawful or not). Handing out metadata isn't even the worst which can happen, e.g. a judge might order them to make copies of unencrypted mails you receive or make copies of unencrypted mails you write or even undermine your encryption the next time you login. They can try to dispute it and that alone does reduce abuse potential (if they operate in a place which still can be called a state of law) in the end especially for mail there is just no true privacy and even less anonymity. Which doesn't mean their service is useless. Just if you worry about political prosecution by EU countries, or do crime it's not protecting you. reply happymellon 3 hours agorootparent> Mainly privacy of communication doesn't always imply anonymity, through sometimes does (and has too!). Anonymity is simply people not knowing who you are, not necessarily what you say. It's not privacy of communication, but privacy of identity. I can post on the internet as Anonymous Coward, and those posts are public even though my identity is private. I can encrypt an email and send it, and it will be picked up by all the relays. They can look up the source and identify me, but hopefully not read the email contents. reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentprevSome interesting facts about Proton Mail. It generates OpenPGP keys on their own servers, and if you want to use your own keys their instructions show users how to upload upload their entire OpenPGP secret keychain to Proton Mail. Not just encryption/signing subkeys, the master key also needs to be included. I've emailed them to ask that they fix this. I also created a post on their user voice thing about it. https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-proton-mail/s... TLDR; Proton Mail tells users to do this: gpg --armor --export-secret-keys \"${USER_ID}\"import-into-proton-mail They should support this instead: gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys \"${PROTON_ENCR_SUBKEY_ID}!\"import-into-proton-mail gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys \"${PROTON_SIGN_SUBKEY_ID}!\"import-into-proton-mail First one leaks the user's master key to them. reply twiss 44 minutes agorootparentHi! Crypto team lead here. 1. We don't generate OpenPGP keys on the servers, we generate them in the client, and then encrypt them with a key derived from your password (which we never send to the server), and store the encrypted key on the server. Then, when you login again, we fetch and decrypt the private key, and use it in the client. The server never has access to your private keys. 2. We do support \"GNU Dummy\" keys now (which is what `gpg --export-secret-subkeys` creates). The required private key material needs to be in a single OpenPGP key though (with a dummy primary key), but that's what `gpg --export-secret-subkeys` does by default. Though, as mentioned above, we don't have access to the primary key on our servers either way. 2a. Note that \"GNU Dummy\" keys are a gpg-specific extension to OpenPGP [1]. The upcoming new version of the OpenPGP standard [2] allows a more standardized way of doing this by combining public key packets and private key packets in a single transferable private key, but it's not widely implemented yet. 3. I would argue that the private key material of the subkeys (used to encrypt and sign your emails) is actually much more important in this case (but of course we don't have access to that either). That's the reason we don't explicitly recommend this: it doesn't meaningfully improve security. [1]: https://github.com/gpg/gnupg/blob/master/doc/DETAILS#gnu-ext... [2]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-cry... reply underlogic 5 hours agorootparentprevfix it? are you kidding! that they demanded the private key tells you _everything_ you need to know about protonmail. reply matheusmoreira 4 hours agorootparentWell, they are literally in the business of making OpenPGP easy to use. I understand your worry but I can also understand where they're coming from. The fact is PGP is stupidly hard. I once ran into a gpg bug that deleted my master key. I got so frustrated I just gave up and forgot about it for years. Without services like Proton Mail, this stuff is just never going to be mainstream. The only way to retain full control over all the keys is to do it the hard way: manually encrypt the emails and send that payload via SMTP. If we refuse to give them the keys, we can't enjoy the convenience of Proton Mail doing that automatically for us. Proton Mail offers a middle ground and it's a very attractive one if you accept the inherent risks associated with giving them the keys. I'm not willing to give them the master key though. I want the ability to generate a bunch of subkeys just for them. Then I can just revoke those keys if they're ever compromised, and the emails will be encrypted and signed by my actual OpenPGP identity that I'm investing time into, not a separate master key generated for my Proton Mail account. The support guys confirmed to me in writing via email that Proton Mail only ever uses the signing and encryption subkeys. They don't need the master key. > We use the signing subkey for signing and the encryption subkey for encryption, and you will have to import the whole OpenPGP at once. So I asked them directly to add support for importing just the subkeys. I made a post on their user voice thing about this too. It's garnered a bit of support already. https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-proton-mail/s... Let's see what happens. reply guappa 1 hour agorootparentThey could have kept the private key in the browser instead of in the server and let the user get the file there. reply Y_Y 2 hours agorootparentprevSo can you put in a dummy master key after the export and before the upload? reply matheusmoreira 2 hours agorootparentMaybe. I haven't tried it. Someone actually suggested this to me on the #gnupg IRC but I just kinda forgot about it. The --export-secret-subkeys command does just that: it replaces the master key with some GNU specific stub packet thing. It's conceivable that they could detect this and reject the uploaded key. In order to avoid that, one might edit the secret key packet manually instead. Just zero fill or randomize all the secret key bits or something. I assume it wouldn't match up with the public key though. Aren't the public and private keys mathematically related? Maybe you can detect that the key is bogus if you try to do cryptographic operations with it. Maybe the operation somehow fails or produces nonsense results. I don't really know enough cryptography to say. reply Y_Y 59 minutes agorootparentRFC4880 uses ElGamal for the asymmetric encryption and so it's a discrete log problem. Roughly the private key x should satisfy `a=b^x mod n` where b and n are known, and a is part of the public key. It goes through similarly for elliptic curve-based schemes. reply underlogic 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's a \"trust me\" story. Honeypot reply jorvi 2 hours agorootparentIt is also security theater. 99.9% of the time the other side you are communicating with stores their mails with server-side encryption. If your fancy encrypted e-mails have a \"plaintext\" mirror, your encryption is useless. You want to optimize your 99.9% case for convenience (say, use Fastmail), and optimize your 00.1% case for security (manually managed PGP with a secondary anonymous e-mail). It makes no sense to trade away swathes of convenience and security just so you can be lazy with your 00.1% case. reply protonmail 42 minutes agorootparenthttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40283698 reply matheusmoreira 2 hours agorootparentprevI view Proton Mail as the convenient 99,9% case. It's a very polished service and it seems to offer a somewhat higher security baseline than the other email providers which probably don't even try to do anything encryption related. The maximum security manual OpenPGP 0.1% case is still absolutely necessary though. No doubt about that. Anyone claiming that Proton Mail solved this doesn't actually understand how OpenPGP works. Not that I would fault them for failing to understand this ludicrously complicated stuff. reply matheusmoreira 4 hours agorootparentprevI can't deny that possibility. Still, it should be an individual's choice to risk it or not. reply 42lux 3 hours agorootparentIt is but if I exchange emails with a Protonmail user I am writing with them like there is no encryption present. reply medo-bear 3 hours agorootparentprevOf course you are right, if majority of individuals were informed and if protonmail was proactive in informing their users about short commings. The problem is that most users are not informed and they think that protonmail is the bee's knees of email privacy and security, while protonmail only promotes that myth. reply emptysongglass 4 hours agorootparentprevProton Mail also still doesn't detect WIKD keys on the other side despite reporting it over 5 years ago. reply twiss 29 minutes agorootparentWe do fetch keys from WKD, as announced almost 5 years ago: https://proton.me/blog/security-updates-2019 :) reply emptysongglass 23 minutes agorootparentActually, you have a bug that has been unfixed for 5 years now.

I can't count on PM users to send my mailserver E2EE mail when the mobile app doesn't support it. reply ta988 5 hours agorootparentprevOf course they will not. If you look at everything they propose there is always that one thing that makes them control everything. Their IMAP bridge, key generation etc reply trog 5 hours agorootparentI don't know much about Proton Mail but presumably they want that so they can actually provide you with a more complete service, other than just being a mail gateway? I would assume that any technically sophisticated users who just want an SMTP/IMAP server would never let their keys leave their control, but there might be other users for whom a \"middle layer\" service which has their keys is good enough. (I guess this is especially evident in cryptoassets where people seem to cheerfully let third parties manage their tokens, so it's not really surprising to me that there are a bunch of people willing to do it with their PGP keys for email purposes.) I guess there's an argument about whether or not they're being responsible in providing such an option at all, which is fair enough. reply matheusmoreira 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's how they make OpenPGP easy to use. Everyone who's ever tried it knows how hopelessly complicated it is. Their bridge's entire purpose is to present a standard email server to email clients so that all the OpenPGP stuff can be done automatically and transparently behind the scenes. Does that create trust issues? Absolutely. Still, OpenPGP sucks and I just can't fault them for trying to fix it. They're even participating in the standards bodies alongside other OpenPGP projects trying to modernize the whole thing. Somehow it resulted in gpg forking the standard and making everything even worse. It was hard to use before, now it's hard and fragmented. https://lwn.net/Articles/953797/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38554393 I suppose they could have gpg or OpenPGP smartcard integration in the bridge, then it could use those keys to sign and encrypt. That's more secure but creates quite a bit of hassle. Suddenly the web and mobile apps become incapable of sending OpenPGP email unless you have the smartcard connected. I've got two NFC enabled YubiKeys and I can't even begin to imagine how to connect this stuff to a smartphone. Looks like there isn't enough support for it. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40177539 reply lancebeet 2 hours agoparentprevYou state this distinction as if it's established, but it's not a definition I've personally heard explicitly stated before. If I read the introduction of the Wikipedia article on \"privacy\", I find the following: >The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasions of privacy by the government, corporations, or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions.

Privacy implies there is an identity, but it is kept hidden. Anonymity implies there is no identity established so there is nothing to hide. We don't see much of the latter since most web services require an email to sign up, at minimum, which still leaves discoverable bread crumbs. The web services that require you to give up nothing to use them are far less popular, so I guess I can see why people might conflate the two. reply Kbelicius 2 hours agorootparentprev> unsanctioned invasions of privacy GPs definition might as well come from wikipedia. reply kube-system 6 hours agoparentprevPrivacy protects some things from the state, which is why the western world has the concepts of warrants and such. But the concept certainly doesn't mean that a business is going to help you cover your tracks in regards to data you've already shared. (in this case, the recovery email address) If you give out your personal information, commit a crime, and ask that person to help you hide, you're not asking for anonymity, you're asking for an accomplice. reply _heimdall 6 hours agorootparentI think that is the GP's point. Privacy means the data is reasonably hidden, though it still exists somewhere in a readable state. Anonymity means the information of who did what really doesn't exist anywhere. In the case of governments, private data is only hidden until the government decides that it needs to look for it (or ask for it). Anonymity means the data isn't there, regardless of whether the government decides it needs to, and has legal justification to, demand access to the data. Anyone providing anonymity is only an accomplice if they know your intent. Simply not collecting data doesn't make you an accomplice, not collecting data with the intent of hiding someone else's illegal behavior does. reply agile-gift0262 4 hours agorootparentI slightly disagree with your distinction. Privacy is about minimising the amount of data collected that's visible to anyone but you. Your data stays with you and/or only you can see your data, therefore, private. Anonymity isn't about the amount of data collected, but that the data collected or accessible by others can't be linked to you. reply kube-system 6 hours agorootparentprevIt is, I am agreeing.

In some cases (when our systems detect something suspicious about your network), we would request an additional email address. Even in those cases, the email addresses are not tied to your account - we only save a cryptographic hash of your email. Due to the hash functions being one-way, we cannot derive your data back from the hash: https://proton.me/support/human-verification While we did use phone verification in the past, this is not the case any longer. Phone numbers were stored in the same way as the email addresses, so, again, we have no way to derive them back from the hash. reply tremarley 6 hours agoparentprevThey are a huge target for spam.

Protonmail can still be the best choice for a pseudonymous mail service so long as it's combined with diligent, consistent IP address obfuscation. Protonmail will continue to allow logins and new account creations over Tor. All the major free email providers have long since disallowed new signups over Tor, and most have some form of degraded user experience when logging in over Tor, if they allow it at all. Small, niche email providers appear and disappear so often that relying on them still to exist even a few months into the future is a big gamble. Hosting one's own email requires payment of some type to the hosting provider, so it is not anonymous.

Yes, hardware is used to design hardware, but typically in a more indirect and heterogeneous way than the \"compiler compiling itself\" scenario.

    "originLink": "https://tgceec.tumblr.com/post/74534916370/results-of-the-grand-c-error-explosion",
    "originBody": "Results of the Grand C++ Error Explosion Competition After much deliberation, the winners of the Grand C++ Error Explosion Competition are finally selected. There are two different award categories. The winners of the first category are those submissions that produced the largest error with the smallest amount of source code. These entries contain a multiplier number, which is just the size of the error message divided by the size of the source code. The second category is artistic merit. Some of the code samples shown will overflow when displayed on the web. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Biggest error, category Anything Name: Turtles all the way down Author: Ed Hanway Multiplier: 5.9 billion This entry is the best implementation of the most common pattern, the double include self. Here’s what it looks like: #include \".//.//.//.//jeh.cpp\" #include \"jeh.cpp\" ` This implementation produced almost six times the amount of error messages of the second best entry of the same type. Biggest error, Category Plain Name: y u no backreference? Author: Chris Hopman Multiplier: 790 million The rules permitted includes in the plain category, so obviously the double include was used in this category as well. #include \"set>.cpp\" #include \"set>.cpp\" Biggest error, category Bare Hands Name: Const Variadic Templates Author: Marc Aldorasi Multiplier: 657 million The bare hands category did not allow for any use of the preprocessor, which lead most people to use recursive or variadic template initiations. This entry was the most compact of the lot. templateclass C{Ca;Cb;};Cc; Best cheat Name: What's perl? Author: Chris Hopman There were several interesting cheat attempts in this competition. For example did you know that in C++ digraph expansion happens after line continuation expansion? We sure did not. Many tried to exploit a division by zero bug in the verification script. One submission even had a patch for this, which tried to changed the evaluator script to make their entry evaluate to infinite error. The best cheat went in a completely different direction, however. The actual code consisted of only one space. Since this entry was in the anything category, it was accompanied by a list of header search directories. That file looked like this. /usr/include; perl -e \"@c=\\\"x\\\"x(2**16); while(1) {print @c}\" 1>&2 When passed to the C++ compiler invocation line, this allows the shell code to escape the test harness sandbox. Extra credit for using Perl, which is the only language less readable than C++ templates. Most surprising Name: templates and nested classes are not best practice Author: Aaron Grothe This piece of code looks innocent but explodes in a completely unexpected manner. We also tested this with Clang, which detects correctly the missing semicolon, after which it anyway tries to evaluate the infinite template recursion and eventually segfaults. This entry gives a glimpse on the kinds of issues an IDE’s code completion engine needs to guard against. templateclass L{Loperator->()};Li=i-> Most lifelike Name: Bjarne's nightmare Author: Victor Zverovich Suppose you are given a task of adding some new functionality to an existing code base. You have been told that the guy who wrote it was “really smart” and that his code is of “enterprise quality”. You check out the code and open a random file in an editor. It appears on the screen. After just one microsecond of looking at the code you have lost your will to live and want nothing more than to beat your head against the table until you lose consciousness. This entry could be that code. We’re glad we only needed to measure it rather than to understand and alter it. #include#includetemplatevoid f(T,U u){std::vector>v;auto i=end(v);find(i,i,u);find(i,i,&u);U*p,**q,r(),s(U);find(i,i,&p);find(i,i,&q);find(i,i,r);find(i,i,&r);find(i,i,s);find(i,i,&s);}templatevoid f(T t){f(t,0);f(t,0l);f(t,0u);f(t,0ul);f(t,0ll);f(t,.0);f(t,.0l);f(t,.0f);f(t,' ');f(t,L' ');f(t,u' ');f(t,U' ');f(t,\"\");f(t,L\"\");}int main(){f(0);f(0l);f(0u);f(0ul);f(0ll);f(.0);f(.0l);f(.0f);f(' ');f(L' ');f(u' ');f(U' ');f(\"\");f(L\"\");f(u\"\");f(U\"\");} Barest hands Title: whatever Author: John Regehr This entry does not have any template definitions or include recursion and yet it put up an admirable fight. This serves as an important reminder to all of us: when used correctly even the simplest of tools can be used to build impressive results. struct x struct zv<y*,w,x{} Epilogue We would like to thank all people who participated in the competition. We hope that all participants as well as you readers have enjoyed this experience. The final question now remaining is whether there will be a second TGCEEC next year? The answer to this is simple: yes, if you, the people, demand it.

    "commentBody": "Results of the Grand C++ Error Explosion Competition (2014) (tgceec.tumblr.com)223 points by st_goliath 16 hours agohidepastfavorite66 comments WalterBright 15 hours agoThe D language compiler uses a technique I call \"poisoning\" which has greatly reduced cascading error messages. The idea is whenever an error is found in an AST node, the AST node is replaced with an \"error\" node. Any combination of an error node with another node is replaced with an error node. Error messages for error nodes are suppressed. It works far better than attempting to repair the AST into some plausible state. It's analogous to the propagation of NaN values in floating point code. reply munificent 14 hours agoparentI've got a compiler for a hobby language that uses this technique too (I probably got it from you, unless I heard it from someone else). It's really really nice. Super easy to implement and really does cut down on cascaded errors. I also use it during type checking. There is a special \"error\" type. If an expression produces a type error, the yielded type of that expression becomes \"error\". Surrounding expressions that consume that type will see the error type and suppress any other type errors they might otherwise produce. That way, you only see the original type error. reply tnh 11 hours agorootparent> Surrounding expressions that consume that type will see the error type and suppress any other type errors they might otherwise produce. We added a slightly-cursed version of this to clang. The goal was: include more broken code in the AST instead of dropping it on the floor, without adding noisy error cascades. The problem is, adding a special case to all \"surrounding expressions that consume that type\" is literally thousands of places. It's often unclear exactly what to do, because \"consume\" means so many things in C++ (think overload resolution and argument-dependent lookup) and because certain type errors are used in metaprogramming (thanks, SFINAE). So this would cost a lot of complexity, and it's too late to redesign clang around it. But C++ already has a mechanism to suppress typechecking! Inside a template, most analysis of code that depends on a template parameter is deferred until instantiation. The implementation of this is hugely complicated and expensive to maintain, but that cost is sunk. So we piggy-backed on this mechanism: clang's error type is ``. The type of this expression depends on how the programmer fixes their error :-) And that's the story of how C gained dependent types (https://godbolt.org/z/szGdeGhrr), because why should C++ have all the fun? (This leaves out a bunch of nuance, of course the truth is always more complicated) reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparentIn D, all semantic analysis of a template waits until instantiation time. This is because D is designed so that the syntax parsing does not need a symbol table. In C++, I solved this problem by simply matching { } in the template body, and accumulating a list of tokens within the { }. Then, when instantiated, the template parameter values were known, and the template syntax could then be semantically analyzed. It was simple and effective. But I was informed that C++ required the syntax parsing and semantics for non-dependent types without instantiation. I asked why, and the answer was \"to check for errors without needing to instantiate it.\" I responded with \"of what use is checking it if it is never used or tested?\" And that was the end of that. > The implementation of this is hugely complicated and expensive to maintain I quietly revolted and refused to implement that disaster. AFAIK there was never a problem with deferring parsing/semantic until instantiation. reply Matheus28 6 hours agorootparentIsn't that what msvc does?

The problem is things like: Foo getFoo(int); getFoo().???; // want code completion! `getFoo()` is missing an argument, but you still want to complete Foo's members. If you type `getFoo().getBar()` you want go-to-definition to work on `getBar`. In clang, we use heuristics to preserve the type in high-confidence cases. (here overload resolution for `getFoo` failed, but there was only one candidate function). This means you can get cascading errors in those cases (but often that's a good thing, especially in an IDE - tradeoffs). reply WalterBright 13 hours agorootparentprevA hint can be provided where the original error is diagnosed. I doubt hints on cascaded errors would be of any use. reply tester756 13 hours agorootparentif you have function like \"public intd Test() { ... typing new line }\" then you will not provide hints when writing that new line due to \"intd\" being invalid type? reply WalterBright 12 hours agorootparentA function's declaration is not affected by its body, so that shouldn't be a problem. reply AlotOfReading 15 hours agoprevI like to increment the most significant digit of my terminal history size every time I run into a compiler error that exceeds the previous value.

Back that day, it was possible because parsers tried to repair bad input to try to keep going, in hopes of diagnosing as many real errors as possible, so as to reduce the number of iterations. Iterations used to be expensive: punching corrections onto cards, etc. If the parser repairs bad syntax, it can cause more errors. If a repair involves insertion, there is a risk of getting into an infinite loop of diagnostics, even. It's kind of anachronistic to have people playing this with C++. Why is this 2014?

It seems Clang is now smart enough to stop compiling after too many errors. reply gmueckl 12 hours agoparentGCC also has (had?) an error limit. But because C++ compilers like to show you actual backtraces of how template instantiations led to the error condition, each single error message can easily have dozens of lines of context.

    "originBody": "Economy Health Health Care Labor Vets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies Some veterinarians and advocates worry about higher prices, lower quality. By: Anna Claire Vollers - March 29, 2024 5:00 am Veterinary personnel keep a cat named Miller calm as he has blood drawn at a veterinary hospital in Florida. Some veterinarians and advocates warn that private equity’s involvement in veterinary care could lead to higher costs for consumers and the closure of independent practices. Wilfredo Lee/The Associated Press HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — About a year ago, veterinarian Melissa Ezell started noticing subtle changes at the midsized animal clinic in Huntsville, Alabama, where she works. Hollowed Out This story is one in a series examining private equity’s impact on health care and the ways that states are responding. Jan. 18: Nearly 400 U.S. hospitals are owned by private equity investors, representing 1 out of every 3 for-profit hospitals. When private equity takes over, hospitals sometimes see closures and cutbacks. Jan. 31: Alabama’s largest provider of home care services employed nearly 800 caregivers scattered across every county in the state, helping 1,100 older and disabled clients. And then suddenly, it was gone. She said she and other vets were feeling pressure from management to make a certain amount of money from every appointment. If a pet owner wasn’t going to spend enough, the message from management was to offer more services. She was urged to pack in more patients outside of normal business hours. “Before, I never felt any pressure to be making a certain amount of money in a day,” Ezell, who started working at the clinic in 2021, told Stateline. “It was just, ‘Fill your schedule, practice good medicine, everything else will come.’” The clinic is owned by National Veterinary Associates, one of the largest veterinary chains in the nation. In 2020 the company was acquired by JAB Consumer Partners, a global private equity firm based in Luxembourg. By early 2023, Ezell said, she felt a shift in atmosphere at the clinic and a greater focus on increasing profits. Private equity’s foray into the human health care industry in recent years has drawn public outrage and legislative scrutiny as firms have been blamed for increasing prices, slashing services and shuttering hospitals to maximize shareholder profits. Now, some veterinarians and advocates are sounding the alarm that private equity’s entry into the pet health care industry could lead to similar results. Some states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning veterinary practices, and some consumer advocates want states to review large-scale acquisitions in the industry. “A large number of these funds are seeing veterinary medicine as a good profit center,” said Dr. Grant Jacobson, an Iowa veterinarian who serves on the board of the Independent Veterinary Practitioners Association. He said he’s seen corporate-owned chains in his region drive up prices for consumers, suppress market competition and skirt state laws that ostensibly prohibit veterinary practices from being owned by non-veterinarians. Private equity firms such as Shore Capital Partners, KKR, TSG Consumer and JAB Consumer Partners have spent billions over the past few years on veterinary practices, specialty animal hospitals, pet insurance services and pet food companies. Among the companies owned by private equity are PetSmart, PetVet Care Centers, FIGO, Thrive Pet Healthcare and ASPCA Pet Health Insurance. Private equity firms say those investments are giving clinics and other providers the capital they need to buy better technology, and that they are improving efficiency. And in many cases, corporate chains can offer their employees better workplace benefits, such as health insurance. In a statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates said its corporate philosophy is “grounded in vets making medical decisions and not a corporate office,” and that its program of shared ownership by veterinarians is “the industry’s largest such program and unique among our peers.” “Our vision is to build a community of hospitals that pet owners trust, are easy to access, and provide the best possible care,” National Veterinary Associates said in the statement. JAB Consumer Partners did not respond to Stateline’s request for comment. More pets, more money Private equity uses pooled investment money from pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy controlling stakes in companies. The firms typically look for a quick return on their investment before selling it within a few years. They have been gobbling up small businesses in myriad industries in recent years — from nursing homes to car washes. ‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures As pet ownership soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, private equity followed close behind. The pandemic years of 2020-2022 were “the peak years for private equity acquisitions of veterinary services and practices,” said Michael Fenne, senior coordinator for health care at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group that advocates for communities affected by private equity ownership. Americans spent a record $147 billion on pet products and services last year. From 2017 to 2022, private equity spent $45 billion on deals in the veterinary sector, according to PitchBook, which tracks investment data. The vet industry is attractive because it’s mostly made up of small, privately owned businesses that corporations can buy and consolidate into larger chains. And it’s mainly a cash-based business: Unlike in human health care, veterinary customers typically pay out of pocket, rather than rely on third-party payers such as insurance companies. In some cases, private equity firms and other corporations buy community clinics from the veterinarians who own them for two, five or even 10 times their value. Then the firms roll them up into a larger chain of clinics that can corner a regional market. It’s a strategy that can push other private owners out of the business, said Jacobson, the Iowa veterinarian. He spent nearly 20 years working at a privately owned practice in Iowa and had hoped to buy it when the original founder retired. But the founder sold the practice to a large veterinary chain owned by Mars Inc. — the private company best known for owning candy brands that include M&Ms — for more than $1 million above his offer, Jacobson said. Mars, while not a private equity firm, is the biggest consolidator of pet care companies in the United States, owning pet food companies, pet pharmacies and veterinary care clinic chains such as Banfield Pet Hospitals and BluePearl. You feel like you don’t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not fully understanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet if they’re sick. – Melissa Ezell, veterinarian About a quarter of general veterinary practices and about three-quarters of specialty practices, such as emergency and surgery care, are now owned by large corporations, according to John Volk of Brakke Consulting, a veterinary management consulting firm. Some private equity-backed chains, such as National Veterinary Associates, buy community-based veterinary practices like Ezell’s without rebranding them under the chain’s name. As a result, clients might not be aware of the ownership change. “It can appear you’re getting community-oriented care when there’s actually this set of big-box incentives underlying [the clinic] that comes from their private equity owners,” Fenne said. Where vets want to work Lori Kogan, a clinical sciences professor at Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, surveyed nearly 900 veterinarians in 2022 about their experiences and perceptions of corporate vs. privately owned veterinary clinics. Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny Even though most of the veterinarians surveyed reported working for corporate-owned clinics, Kogan found more than half said they would prefer to work in privately owned clinics. The benefits offered by corporate chains, such as health insurance, didn’t seem strong enough to override other preferences, Kogan told Stateline. “Feeling like they have a voice in decision-making, feeling like they’re recognized as an individual, those are things that are really important to people,” she said. “I think corporate ownership could accomplish those things, but it will take paying attention.” Ezell, the veterinarian who left National Veterinary Associates, said the pressure has an impact on patients and their humans as well. “Either you’re getting talked into additional services that may or may not actually be necessary, or your feel like you’re being rushed,” Ezell said. “You feel like you don’t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not fully understanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet if they’re sick.” In its statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates noted that it has made “continued investment in technology and infrastructure, pioneering clinical research, industry-leading continuing education programs and wellbeing initiatives.” Could states step in? Last August, Thrive Pet Healthcare announced it would be closing the only 24-hour emergency veterinary clinic in the Rochester, New York, metro area. Thrive is a chain of more than 380 veterinary hospitals based in Austin, Texas, that is owned by private equity firm TSG Consumer. “The thought of having the only 24-hour emergency pet care center in our entire metro area close was really scary,” said Rachel Barnhart, a Democratic member of the Monroe County Legislature in New York who has taken her dogs to the clinic. “We are a community of more than a million people. The idea that we can’t support a 24-hour pet facility is outrageous.” Barnhart wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, asking it to look into Thrive, which operates more than a dozen clinics in Rochester. She said she’d seen the FTC act against anticompetitive practices in the veterinary industry elsewhere, and she felt Thrive deserved similar scrutiny. Thrive leadership said in a letter to Barnhart and in media reports that a shortage of ER veterinarians made it impossible to hire enough workers to keep the 24-hour clinic open. But Barnhart suspected the company wanted to shutter the clinic because its staff recently voted to unionize. CEO Tad Stahel said in the letter to Barnhart that the closure was unrelated to the staff unionization. Should You Insure Your Pet? Without State Oversight, It’s Hard to Say. In 2022, the FTC took action against JAB Consumer Partners, which recently acquired an array of veterinary and pet service companies. The FTC required the firm to divest some of its vet clinics in California, Colorado, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., as a condition of approving its multibillion-dollar purchases of two other multistate veterinary care chains. If states were to authorize officials or agencies to review similar large-scale mergers and acquisitions in the veterinary industry, that “would be a good first step” toward protecting consumers, said Fenne, of the advocacy group. Many states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning veterinary practices, including Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina. The idea is to prevent corporate interests from guiding veterinarians’ medical judgment. Experts and advocates expect to see further corporatization in veterinary care as more companies acquire not just vet clinics, but also other businesses across the pet care spectrum. In February, asset management behemoth Blackstone Inc. acquired Rover, the nation’s largest online platform for pet sitting, dog walking and other services. In the past two years, JAB has acquired several of the largest pet insurance companies in the United States and Europe. Ezell, the Alabama veterinarian, eventually decided to take a job at another clinic in town that’s privately owned. She will start there in a few weeks. “Not all corporate medicine is horrible, and you can find amazing veterinarians and caring support staff anywhere,” she told Stateline. “But it’s easy to lose sight of your values. The whole reason we’re doing this is we want to make a difference in animals’ and people’s lives. If we’re unable to do that, shouldn’t we try to fix that?” Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct the number of Thrive veterinary hospitals. SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

Think of making a cool $30 million+ a quarter, per partner -- thanks real estate (and apparently, emergency medical services) \"investments\"! This is a direct funnel to syphon money from the workers to the ruling class. That's even more cash than the top brass at FAAGs make. How can this phenomenon be reigned in and sorted in the medium to long-term? It's a loss for everyone (99.9999%) except the miniscule quantity of winners (0.0001%, yes, that's 1 in 1,000,000 - there aren't that many large-scale P/E firms). Housing owned by P/E couldn't be more soul sucking. Scratch that, this applies to every case I'm aware of where P/E firms own a thing. Anecdote: Last month my dear old dog was suddenly very ill and I spent $12k on emergency surgery to save his sweet life. No regrets, I'm grateful he was fixable. But in the waiting room I did the conservative math for what the SAGE Emergency Veterinary Hospital in Redwood City, CA makes in a year (before the comparatively small overhead, tax-deductible expenses) and they are pulling in at least $30 million in this single location. That's.. a lot, for many 20 total staff. Also they charged me $500 for each follow-up visit, which is way more than my real life surgeon charged me earlier this year! (Even including insurance, he didn't charge much for the follow-ups to make sure I survived.) Damn. For the dog lovers out there: Doggo is alive and well, can maybe last another year or two we hope. Btw, who owns SAGE? NVA, a P/E firm. https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/sage-veterinary-centers... https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/national-veterinary-... reply kbenson 8 hours agoparentIdeally you'd expect the market to deal with it how it normally does, which is to have people open up competing practices to undercut them. I think the problem is that VC has correctly identified this as not only a field where people are willing to pay a lot based on emotion, but it's also regulated enough that their strategy of buying out existing practices leaves them fairly safe from a lot of competition. I wouldn't be surprised if non-competes factor heavily into their strategy either. In that case I would hope the government could at least step in to combat anti-competitive behavior (which I think this definitely is), but that always seems to lag a decade after it's first needed. reply ceejayoz 8 hours agorootparentLocally, the answer was that the folks who could open up a competing practice were under non-compete agreements if they left the PE-owned place. (We had a local legislator step in to help void them.) https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&catId=3115&Id=1186... > Marion said early efforts to enlist former VSES doctors or others in the community to start an ER were discouraging. Some VSES doctors had already left the area, some had signed contracts for new jobs locally, most were worried about the constraints of noncompete agreements they signed with Thrive, and \"no one seemed eager to take on the tremendous responsibility of owning, managing and running an emergency hospital even with the help and support of the local veterinary community.\" reply reactordev 7 hours agorootparentGood thing non-competes are now illegal. https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/... reply ceejayoz 7 hours agorootparentMaybe.

Imagine if SCOTUS decides said law banning non-competes is unconstitutional. Could they do it in such a way to kill the \"non-competes are unenforceable\" law in CA? that would suck. reply dantheman 4 hours agorootparentNo, it's the FTC doesn't have the authority - this is an easy thing to do federally, just convince congress to ban them... most things should not be decided by the executive. reply FireBeyond 7 hours agorootparentprevMy only concern in this context is that this is in relationship to employee relationships. If said vets had an ownership stake in a sold practice, could they be restricted by virtue of this different context? reply koolba 8 hours agorootparentprevWill be interesting to see how the recent FTC non compete ban plays out in this space. It seems like a prime candidate to promote competition as the key licensing is held by the individual (the vet) as opposed to the company. reply ceejayoz 8 hours agorootparentYes, I'm hoping that holds up in SCOTUS. reply aaronbrethorst 6 hours agorootparentI hope you’re planning on voting in November. reply tick_tock_tick 6 hours agorootparentprevI don't it's a blatant power grab by a federal agency that doesn't have the authority. That being said I hope Congress takes up the issue and actually passes a law banning it. reply thfuran 5 hours agorootparentCongress already passed a law granting the ftc the authority to prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair practices affecting commerce. reply willis936 7 hours agorootparentprev>always seems to lag a decade after it's first needed Not always. Back when the US enforced antitrust there was no decade wait for results. However these days all you can expect from the government are low corporate tax rates, high interest rates, and a thumbs up saying the economy is strong. There is no antitrust enforcement coming. The only thing there is an appetite for is to loot the younger generations. reply rtkwe 6 hours agorootparentprevThe other problem is private equity can burn money in the short term to undercut new competitors at their most vulnerable times and return to profit gathering soon after. reply mattmaroon 8 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think it’s regulated much at all. It’s nothing like human medicine. Their moat is that there aren’t many veterinarian schools. reply kbenson 7 hours agorootparentRequiring a degree or certification (at a legal leval) is a form of regulation. That it's costly and time consuming just makes that regulation a larger barrier. If you can somehow remove much of those people that already have the means to satisfy that regulation from the market, you've successfully controlled the supply for at least the amount of time it takes the pipeline to produce more of them. Now I'm wondering if the VC firms took steps to disrupt that pipeline as well in some way. That would be pretty overt, but I've never gotten the impression that these people feel the need to be at all subtle. reply mattmaroon 7 hours agorootparentI mean, it’s always been regulated if you count that. I think what’s really happened is pet ownership (and the amount of care per pet) has simply grown at a higher pace than vet schools. reply kbenson 4 hours agorootparentMost (all?) states in the U.S. require state licenses to practice, and you can't get much more regulatory than that, so yes, I count that. There have been a few different reports put out about the current situation and how vets are being bought out. The article here is one of them. Is your theory that they aren't actually buying vets, or that they aren't raising prices, or that what they're doing is irrelevant to the current problems? I know in my town and from my personal experience over the last two years dealing with five different vet practices, one of which is a local VCA branch and also one associated withe the local humane society, all the reports ring startingly true. VCA is extremely expensive compared to all other vets, but is also the only emergency location in the area. If we go in and it's not an emergency it's about 40% more than other vets. If it is an emergency it's much more, but at least there's a plausible reason in that case. That said, there are more pets. Our local humane society is at well over double capacity for animals that are mostly aged suspiciously close to the beginning of covid. Multiple things can be happening at the same time though. Why do you think VC decided now to get into animal health care? reply amirhirsch 6 hours agorootparentprevpet insurance has expanded the demand reply mattmaroon 6 hours agorootparentYes. That must be true because every vet office I go to advertises it heavily. The way car dealers push warranties. And also, some theorize low birth rate is causing people to treat their pets like children thus necessitating more care. Think how many people call themselves a dog mon. Also, it’s really only been a couple decades since Frontline caught on and people largely let their animals live inside. Vet schools are largely for-profit, often in other countries.

Y Combinator has even funded a few. That's not the main problem (although software licenses and training can be expensive). What is a problem are compliance costs driven by overlapping layers of local, state, and federal rules. Plus if they take insurance payments then they have to deal with myriad different coverage policies and billing requirements. Some of this can be outsourced, but only to a limited extent and at a high cost. reply mandevil 6 hours agorootparentInsurance is a minor issue for vets, essentially none of the population has animal insurance. It's also not a super big deal for dentists, as I understand it, though I don't know as much about the back-end of dental practices (wife is pharmacist, sister-in-law is a vet tech, so I know those businesses pretty well). Insurance reimbursement from the monopoly PBM's (three of them control 80% of the drug insurance market) are what is killing independent pharmacies- you have to be one of the national chains to have the scale to effectively negotiate against the PBM's, otherwise reimbursement rates are routinely below your wholesale price. From talking to my wife it's not really compliance and government regulation in the pharmacy space (which is far more regulated than the vet space, naturally) that has forced consolidation. For the most part the regulations haven't changed that much in decades. What's changed is heavily reduced insurance reimbursement rates from those monopoly PBM's plus one other factor: educational debt. The idea that our intrepid young vets/pharmacists/dentists/doctors graduate with a huge pile of educational debt (200k or more), then have to take out massively more debt to start up a new business(1), at the same time they are also in prime child-bearing/rearing/caring age, that's a really hard sell for most. That's why being an employee is such an attractive thing. 1: And those loans have to be much bigger than before, because drugs are more expensive so your inventory costs are higher, people want nicer places offering more amenities, etc. They also need to be able to pay off those software licenses, which may not be individually expensive but are another new cost that wasn't present 30 years ago that has to be paid on the reduced reimbursement rates from the PBMs. reply johndhi 7 hours agorootparentprevAgree here, having worked in health IT. reply refurb 6 hours agorootparentprevIndeed.

I also had a cat with kidney disease, and the veterinary system was not very helpful about treatment. I had to learn most of it on my own. The \"prescription\" pet food situation is an example of free market entities subverting regulatory agencies. \"Prescription\" pet foods exist only through a selective lack of enforcement by the FDA. The manufacturers make claims that the food treats specific medical conditions. That's a drug claim. By law they would be required to test for efficacy and have it approved as a drug. But the FDA chooses to allow manufacturers to sell pet food that makes drug claims without testing or approval so long as they contract with veterinarians to only sell it under \"prescription.\" It's not a prescription (it's not a drug!), it's a way to skirt regulation. For kidney disease you want foods high in moisture, moderate in protein and low in phosphorous. You can buy foods that meet these requirements at your pet food store. There are options that are much higher quality than said \"prescription\" foods hawked by Hills, Royal Canin and the like. They're just not advertised as treating kidney disease because they don't make inappropriate drug claims! reply s1artibartfast 4 hours agorootparentThanks for the pointer about simply looking for low phosphorous foods, that makes a lot of sense. I don't see this as a failure of a free market, but failure of policy makers and regulators. Consumer hostile over-regulation regulation the problem to be fixed, not the market entities. Even without businesses, you still have self-interested parties like veterinarians associations pushing for bad regulations.

The way to get it sorted is to fix the market dynamics that have lead to ridiculous housing price increases. They’ll move on to greener pastures when homes in good markets aren’t appreciating at high rates.

I was shitcanned after the PE owners of my company got their arm twisted into selling my company to a strategic buyer that had previously bought another division of my company and then played dirty under my employer's name. When the buyer was served the inevitable lawsuit, they played even dirtier and effectively goaded the judge into hearing out the weak case made by my employer. After that development, the buyer just threw in a massive offer (likely 4-5x the realistic value, but I wasn't privy to any details), bought us, dropped the suit, terminated any employee that testified against them, terminated any employee that didn't keep the lights on, and have been leaving the business to languish while they sort out multiple other lawsuit-riddled acquisitions they've made in the last year. Whenever an employee of the buyer shows up to a facility that belongs to my previous company, they come with a bodyguard/security, if you need any hints regarding their moral character. Most players in the industry refuse to deal with that buyer, so they just attempt to deceive acquired customers when making an acquisition, and throw a bunch of money and crook lawyers at the (many) lawsuits that pop up. This type of behavior is not strictly limited to private equity. The real issue is that people who pull stunts like the above will never get their teeth punched out for it, and they're a wolf in a henhouse when dealing with a legal system that's largely powerless to say \"I know it when I see it\". The punishment for being a piece of human dogshit in this manner is effectively nothing, and nearly infinitely less than the reward. I haven't thought of an answer that doesn't give discomforting power to those evaluating these cases, but as long as repeat offenders can paper over every bad-faith action by claiming they're following the letter of (some interpretation of) the law and never get punished for it, it will never stop. reply nradov 7 hours agoparentprevPrivate equity per se isn't a problem.

At 4 years, that's a $120k degree - but from my understanding, starting a vet practice is over a $1MM, so it's safe to assume buying an existing vet practice is at least $1MM, and I don't think $120k in debt would be THE limiting factor for buying a $1MM+ practice.

But young professionals don't have the money to buy up the practices, that is assuming any business acumen they might have had would not have been weeded out by schooling. And even if they did - there's no reason to buy an established practice off of a retiring owner when you can just grow your own (granted there is a buyer for you at the end of it). There's also the tax aspect.

But most young physicians and veterinarians no longer want to devote their entire lives to running a small business. The hassles of dealing with paperwork and regulatory compliance have gotten worse every year. Those professionals would rather gain some semblance of work/life balance by becoming employees instead of owners. Doctors and vets who own their own practices have always been prime targets for scammers because they typically have both a lot of cash flow and a lack of financial sense. In many cases when they get cheated they're too ashamed to even report crimes to law enforcement. I am aware of several cases where trusted office employees were embezzling large sums and got away with it for years due to lack of basic accounting controls. reply riahi 6 hours agorootparentI’ll actually push back against this narrative. A large problem is that people are coming out with insurmountable debt burdens from professional school and are simply unable to balance that and the start up costs of a new practice. Combine that with states having adopted certificate of need requirements since the late 1980s, it is literally illegal for some doctors to even try to open their own practice. In my state, I legally cannot open a radiology imaging center without spending thousands of dollars on a petition to the department of community health begging “please approve my imaging center” which then is posted publicly on a tracker website where in-house counsel for every single health system / competitor can sue to block you from ever opening. They can also sue to block you from upgrading your equipment when it’s long out of date. It’s untenable. While I agree there are many problems with poor financial savvy amongst highly trained professionals, I also realize that the average debt burden is over 250k and practice start up costs are not getting cheaper. A PET or MR or CT could easily cost 500k-1million alone, without including real estate costs, building/renovation costs, or bribes/legal fees battling for the right to open your doors. reply nradov 5 hours agorootparentTrue, but even in states with certificate-of-need laws those only apply to certain types of facilities.

But watch out if they want to do any procedures outside of a hospital. The capital / regulatory heavy specialties are getting PE-roll-upped and that’s the same story as Veterinarians. The new world is that we are becoming bound to hospitals / private equity in a way akin to sharecroppers on a plantation, mostly because of regulatory uncertainty which requires tremendous capital to overcome. Some states are making it easier for surgeons to open surgicenters, but those are still very tightly regulated. Same with freestanding ERs, birthing centers, radiation therapy treatment centers, or freestanding imaging centers. Even if I wanted to raise the capital myself, the regulatory uncertainty makes the playing ground so unfair that it is functionally impossible without bringing in PE money to fund the legal fight for approval. ——— I trawled the approvals this year in my state.

As I recall it was close to a million dollars before the cost of the building. There was another 2–300K in capital costs for modernizing the clinic. So, yes, it can cost a lot to start a vet clinic. Many younger vets will do housecall practices, which do have lower startup costs, but it’s necessary to have a good relationship with a practice with a hospital for any procedures which need to be done and, given that they’re nominally in competition with those practices, this may not be the easiest thing to do (before buying the hospital, my brother did housecall work, but mostly outside the service area of the hospital that he used for his procedures. He also was their on-call fill-in vet for when the in-practice vets were on vacation or out sick). There was a kind of standard progression in veterinary careers where owning or being a partner in a practice with a hospital/clinic was the end stop of the career, but remember that a practice run by PE has different goals than a practice run by a vet. The vet-owner is looking to have junior vets who will one day buy them out and finance their retirement. Very different from a PE-owner looking to maximize cashflow and profitability with little concern about the vets working at the practice who are viewed as fungible widgets. reply mattmaroon 7 hours agorootparentI do understand what you’re saying, I just think it’s a problem that’s at least self-limiting. A million dollars is not a lot to start a business of that scale. You can’t open a steakhouse in any mid-sized city for that much, and vet clinics actually make money.

If it barely breaks even and the owners end up flipping the assets and real estate, that's a win. - The obvious reason PE has stepped up their investments in pet care is that COVID led to a huge spike in US pet ownership. In about 5 years this spike in vet demand will fade. When that happens, these firms will wring their investments dry before moving on, leaving debt-saddled clinics behind. You can't just ignore the actual economic context because you found a fact-free explanation that high schoolers find convincing. - in general it might be barely profitable to run a good vet clinic, but highly profitable to run a terrible clinic. I doubt emergency vet medicine is very profitable. You can't just assume PE runs the clinics the same as a vet-owned clinic. In fact the article makes it clear that this is not the case. - There is just a total lack of humility from you: being smug and ignorant is a bad combination. Sure, the article is full of people complaining about specific PE-owned vets, and the comments on HN are full of people complaining about specific PE-owned vets.... but maybe if they understood the law of supply and demand, they wouldn't be so upset. reply mattmaroon 6 hours agorootparentThese are terrible arguments. PE firms aren’t running around flipping veterinarian firms for a couple hundred grand. They do that with fortune 500 companies for billions, not vet offices for tens of thousands. They’re buying them because they expect good ROI going forward. They are not dumb, your argument about Covid has surely occurred to them and been rejected for reasons that seem pretty apparent. Who is being smug now? Assuming the PEs miss the most obvious idea? It’s a garbage one though and they know it, the spike wasn’t that big, demand had been growing much faster than supply for decades and will continue to, etc. They’re buying because they can increase efficiency (I am sure by cutting patient care and other awful things at times but in some ways that are good too), because the industry will grow and consolidate, because demand will keep outstripping supply. They’re probably right. They usually are. I don’t think humility has anything to do with finding a title of an article to be sensationalized clickbait. I love it when you guys switch to personal insults because you don’t like a conflicting opinion, because you’re so bad at it. Another thing that used to happen on Reddit and not here, by the way.

You can’t tell me the article is right one minute and wrong the next.

You’d have to buy a whole lot of veterinary offices, like all of them, to get into the billions. It’s probably an insignificant sum relative to the others. And all of it just shows they think the pet industry is going to continue to do well. If they’re trying to flip real estate, they are going about it in a really stupid way. And you just proved my point was for the big chains rather than individual practices like what is happening in the veterinary industry. Also the second link says they are buying up mental health because of anticipated continuing long term demand, which is exactly what I said PE is doing here.

Private equity scooping up veterinary practices makes sense - it's a good investment. It's the same way PE firms will pool together a bunch of discrete dentist offices. I see many posters in here talking about how it's \"rent-seeking\" behavior, but frankly, these services are in demand and consolidating them is an increase in market efficiency. It's still good business to open up new clinics, even if the end goal is getting bought out (the standard practice for 95%+ of companies for which everyone here works for or is the beneficiary of). If people are willing to spend more, then nothing really changed. If anything, goods and services were mispriced beforehand. If they raise the prices too high, nobody can afford the vet services and they will go out of business. If they make prices too low, we end up in a UK-style NHS situation where your dog's cancer is in line to get treated 8 months after they die, and they go out of business. Prices going up is natural for a restricted supply of extremely skilled labor (yes, you still need surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, drugs, human-tier equipment) and growing demand for the services (people having more pets in lieu of children in western countries). People were getting \"better deals\" before and are now being priced appropriately. A big trend here is the increase in desire to spend on pets, particularly in the US, the richest country in the world. Yes, consolidation is one part of it, but we have to look at demographic trends as well. More and more people are spending more and more money on pets (in lieu of children). And yet, the increase in supply of skilled veterinarians has not increased nearly as much. Obviously, investment firms need their cut, but prices go up while owned by an investment firm does not make it evil, nor does it not make sense or outrageous. What might actually be considered outrageous around here is spending $20k on surgery for a domestic pet (common occurence as far as I can tell in a metropolitan area). Lastly - there's actually a competitive healthcare market here! I have enjoyed being able to peek behind the curtain and look at what procedures of this scale should really cost, e.g. we still need the same training, people, equipment, and time relative to human medicine (arguably with a much lower tolerance of risk), but the prices are...... reasonable. $10-20k for a crazy surgery would be highly affordable for a human, and these PE firms are actually competing with each other for clients for these expensive procedures. It makes me wish for a similar competitive pricing landscape for humans - even if they are PE owned. The last thing anyone needs when caring for their pet is a government bureaucrat handing out human-medicine style hospital monopolies to a \"partnered provider\" knighted by the government which will force a 100x billing charge to bill the govt and make it illegal to not have pet insurance while driving your premiums up 100x over the next 30 years. reply SoftTalker 6 hours agoparent> people having more pets in lieu of children This is the weird thing to me. When I was a kid, a pet was more or less a thing. You took care of it, but if it got really sick or badly injured you put it down and maybe got another one. The idea of people spending 5 or 6 figures on pet health care is rather mind-boggling. reply fsn4dN69ey 2 hours agorootparentIn total, for a 15-year old cat, I have spent $8,000+ USD.

Do you really think this is what people want when they call for increased government regulation? Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith. Government regulation can take many forms, not all of them dystopian, and many of them leading to better outcomes. Sadly there are a lot of people, even here in the comment section, for whom, when you say \"government regulation,\" their imagination jumps to the worst possible form of government regulation they can think of, and they project that imagined scenario on the person who said it. There are no doubt many ways the government can rein in the excesses and abuses of private equity without leading to hospital monopolies and forced purchases of pet insurance. reply fsn4dN69ey 4 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, I think I'm in that boat. Truly, I appreciate the discourse. However, whether or not that's what people want, that's the reality. Next time you get a medical charge, even with insurance, ask for an itemized bill. Compare the bill you receive to the one you receive when you tell them \"I'm paying with cash\". When I pay cash with a third party provider, they \"magically\" reduce the amount I owe by orders of magnitude, even for simple bloodwork (United States, major metropolitan area). Again, in good faith, what am I supposed to expect when I hear regulation in animal medicine? People like my partner are studying and training for years to do this work. People are leasing or buying real estate for these facilities. They are buying equipment, they are hiring trained surgeons, nurses, and practitioners who have been committing at minimum a decade of their life for this - what am I supposed to expect with \"calls for regulation\" a la human medicine style (the only comparison we have), especially when prices are ACTUALLY competitive, as I believe the human medicine market should be? I can be convinced of any position, but it has to make sense. What prices or charges, even with private equity-funded veterinary firms, do you consider egregious and need a non-opt-outable mandatory third party oversight for? Has there been a good or a service you feel was only available at a specific provider that they gouged you on? Again, not being aggressive, just genuinely curious. reply snapetom 6 hours agoparentprevMarried to a boarded vet of over 20 years. She's been through the era of working for privately owned clinics and now the PE-dominated landscape. 100% agree with you. The comments here range from short-sighted to plain-old stupid, especially those complaining about costs. What many fail to realize is that vet care went through a professionalization in the 80's and 90's. Boards and specializations that humans had like dermatology and cardiology cropped up and really exploded in the past 20 years or so. Along with that was quality of care, and along with that, cost. What frequently happens is this: If you go to a clinic with an old-school vet, he'll charge $300 for a dog spay. Down the road with the younger vet, she'll charge $600, but that's because she's running a wider blood panel with a course of anti-biotics. She won't do the surgery without it because research shows that course improves survivability by 50%. Which are you going to choose? Don't kid yourself in thinking the quality of care is the same. Business and veterinary schools have researched this to death. You can't cheap out and get the same care. Maybe you'll find a young vet that's willing to skip the extras, but many won't. The worst thing to happen to vet care is Yelp and Dr. Google who emboldens self-righteous hacks to complain to state boards at every little thing they think the vet did wrong. Finally tons of people flat out belittle the cost of labor. Vets go to school a minimum of 4 years post college. They can practice right out of vet school, but many go through an internship these days. If you go to a specialist, that's an extra 1-2 years of internships and another 2-3 years of a residency and a board exam, too. On top of that, many states require veterinary assistants to be licensed, which is equivalent to an AA. In practice, most have bachelor's these days and we've known a few with master's degrees. Meanwhile, people bitch and moan here for $500 a night of emergency care, ignoring the fact you're hiring a team of highly trained and educated people to take care of your precious Fluffy. reply fsn4dN69ey 4 hours agorootparentThanks! Glad to see someone else with similar experiences. The other issue I think people are overlooking is... 20 years ago you would present to your local, low-cost veterinarian, and they wouldn't know what the issue was (or they knew and couldnt treat it), and your animal would just die. Now we have a ton more information, a ton more training, and an issue now that would be game-ending prior is now treatable, but it comes at a cost. We see the same patterns in human medicine too. A lot of it has to do with demographics and cultural shifts in my opinion, as well as the supply/demand factor of trained practitioners. reply romanows 5 hours agorootparentprev50% survivability increase, but is that going from 2/10000 to 1/10000 deaths?

Given animals that come in to be spayed, say in a large US city, how risky is spaying? Is it worth everyone paying $300 more to reduce it by a very small absolute percentage? Should vets actually be more up front about this than the ones I'm familiar with are? reply snapetom 2 hours agorootparentI get you're saying it's not the key point, but in practice, it really should be. The spay and cost numbers were just examples. In general, yes, spays are safe, but it is anesthesia. There's a risk of death and it gets much more complicated with a huge variety of factors - age of the animal, species, whether she is in heat, and of course like we mentioned - pre-existing conditions that do not obviously present itself without a clinical workup. The last one is huge. There are plenty of values that are indicative of organ failure that would not be obvious to an owner.

It's not a few bad apples. This is quite literally what capitalism is: it's building an enclosure and then jacking up the price. It's rent-seeking. It's regulatory capture. Private equity is infecting every aspect of your life and the tactics are the same: 1. Cut costs; 2. Jack up the prices; 3. Block competition by buying them up, legislation/regulation, etc; and 4. Loading the entity up with debt and cash out before it explodes. No value is being created or added. It's pure wealth extraction.

The only way a market can function is with a strong government because markets require regulation and courts to function. They require a stable financial system. None of this is possible without government. Sorry to all the anarcho-capitalists. Also, I didn't say \"free markets\". I said \"capitalism\". It's interesting that so many use these terms interchangeable and they're not interchangeable. For the longest time I knew people didn't know what socialism is. Thing is, most people don't actually know what capitalism is either. Markets aren't predicated on capitalism. Markets exist in every economic system and predate capitalism by thousands of years. Capitalism is merely who gets to extract the surplus value of labor. In feudalism it went to lords and kings. In capitalism, it goes to capital owners. They're otherwise functionally equivalent. We've simply replaced the divine right of kings to deifying the ultra-wealthy.

Maybe airlines need to step in to facilitate travel from many places to intentionally created hubs for certain kinds of cervices and Canada and Mexico: if someone can take a $400 ticket to a \"city of dentists\" or \"city of vets\" offshore where there are thousands of practices and fix their teeth for 5% of US price, there won't be a market for this kind of price gouging. Or in fact, make it actual offshore. On converted container ships outside the territorial waters.

As long as there is a potential to reintroduce it, they will be empowered because no one will build a business that can become illegal or unprofitable by decree - no one except someone with the most money because these will figure the way out at best (because people still need vets let's say), or because they will drive regulation, at worst. Only something that clearly puts the service provision outside of government's reach, will fix it. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Parts of it are also to be made freely available. Save to Pocket listen Print view ARD and ZDF are putting their streaming media libraries on a common technical foundation. (Bild: Cineberg/Shutterstock) May 6, 2024 at 4:01 pm CEST 2 min. read By Daniel Herbig This article was originally published in German and has been automatically translated. The streaming media libraries of the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF are also growing together technically: The broadcasters want to develop a joint \"streaming OS\", they announced on Monday. The code is also to be made publicly available as part of \"one of the largest open source initiatives in Germany\". Competitors should also be able to use the Streaming OS code in this way, ARD Chairman Kai Gniffke commented on the initiative. He can imagine a cross-provider German streaming network. \"If other institutions – including media companies that compete with us – use the software, then you can also imagine it as the nucleus for a large German-language platform.\" ARD and ZDF media libraries also want to use the shared technical foundation to manage user data across the board. Meanwhile, it is still unclear which parts of Streaming OS will be made publicly available. In addition to the streaming player itself, the broadcasters' joint streaming software will also bundle the login system, code for recommendations and the \"core of the design system\". ARD and ZDF are thus also placing their media libraries on a common technical basis, having already grown together in terms of content in recent years. \"Giving something back to society\" In addition to private providers, educational institutions can also benefit from the broadcasters' planned open source code, according to the broadcasters. \"In this way, we are giving something back to society for which it has paid us,\" comments ZDF Director General Norbert Himmler on the project. Cooperation with European partners is also conceivable, according to a statement. ARD and ZDF are setting up a joint office for the streaming OS, where the project will be managed. The technical development of the operation is to take place in a commercial subsidiary, which will be founded under the management of ARD. The broadcasters hope that Streaming OS will be ready in spring 2025.

People often claim petrol tax was designed to pay for roads infrastructure but it wasn't legally bound, and is not a hypothicated tax. Nor is the ULEZ and like costs to drive in the inner city with a petrol engine.

It's just that because German language is not used much outside Germany, official government terms and language basically get conflated. reply callalex 9 hours agorootparentprevIf I’m understanding the concept correctly, in the USA we describe that kind of tax as “earmarked” which is a reference to folding the corner of a page in a book to mark your place. reply krispyfi 1 hour agorootparent> \"Earmark\" comes from the livestock term, where the ears of domestic animals were cut in specific ways so that farmers could distinguish their stock from others grazing on public land. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark_(politics) reply mschuster91 13 hours agorootparentprevI'd translate \"Beitrag\" literally to \"contribution\", maybe add a \"mandatory\" as qualifier. The key difference is that taxes are completely under discretion of parliamentary control, whereas the Rundfunkbeitrag is under discretion of the individual broadcast authority governance boards (which are too closely tied to politicians for my comfort, but that's another thing). reply sealeck 15 hours agorootparentprevTax vs contribution? reply freedomben 13 hours agorootparentI think contribution is a much higher level word that is way too abstract to be useful in this context. When I think of \"Contributions\" I think of a voluntary transfer of money, whether from an individual to an organization or from an individual to themselves (like \"contributions\" to an IRA or 401k for example). But a contribution could even be sharing ideas with a group of friends (contributing to the conversation) or anything really. reply Grimeton 15 hours agorootparentprevbroadcast license fee/tv license fee reply qwertox 14 hours agorootparentTV license fee. This is how it's named in the UK. Broadcast license is what broadcasters pay for in order to be allowed to broadcast the licensed content. reply usrusr 13 hours agorootparentThe key difference is that the government never touches the money anywhere between citizen and broadcaster, to avoid unwarranted influence. I assume that people who know the British term know that, as the German one is surely modeled after the BBC. I'm writing for other readers. The downside is that it's a per head (or per household) sum, not coupled to income like taxes would be. This is usually explained away by the fee being separate from the state, but the reality is that Germany actually has it all implemented, in the form of the opt-in \"church tax\" coupled to taxable income just like regular tax. Handled by the tax office, but not going too government coffers. Would be so easy to extend the implementation to public broadcasting, because you don't pay to consume the media, you pay to live in an environment that is not dominated by profit-driven broadcasting media. There are many negative things to say about our public broadcasting, but when I look at other countries that don't have strong public broadcasting, it's so much the lesser evil, totally worth the fee. (personally, I'd love to see that \"church tax implementation\" opened up to all kinds of opt-in membership organisations that would see value in income-coupled membership fees, I believe that a lot of good things could work that way, with people of all income levels enjoying an objectively fair way of contributing) reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentThat is something I could never understand, and I have at least 20 year of GEZ adventures. Back in Portugal, we took the approach that radio tax is part of the electricity bill, and when TVs came to be, the radio tax became TV tax as well. Nothing else, doesn't matter how many people live on the household, if there are Internet devices, radio on the car, whatever. Same applies to the church tax, everyone pays, it is part of the taxes and no one else, besides the state gets to see how much it is in practice. reply constantcrying 15 hours agoparentprevOne would hope so, but they don't even open the shows for public use, they don't even keep them around so people can watch the things they had to pay for. reply fsflover 16 hours agoparentprevIf you really think so, you should sign this petition: https://publiccode.eu reply drewmcarthur 7 hours agorootparentsigned, thank you for posting! reply Adverblessly 15 hours agoprevHere in Israel they just upload most of their TV content to YT, some if it is really good.

They've since changed their tune and ceased uploading whole episodes, only excerpts go onto YouTube now with links to their own \"Mediathek\".

You cannot change it to a fixed level manually too, on the Chromecast. reply deeth_starr_v 10 hours agoparentThe Hulu app does this on LG TV also. Public and private sectors are the same sometimes reply hoc 11 hours agoprevTo understand the quality level of their current platforms: they actually manage to recommend the same stream you just watched as the next auto-play entry and even might jump directly into the credits again, giving you a 10 to 20 seconds loop in extreme cases. While a two-stream recommendation loop is quite common in both systems, the loop above only happened twice for me so far. Still, it might just perfectly highlight the lack of passion and user focus plaguing their current platforms.

    "title": "Navigating Life's Volatility: The Role of Debt",
    "originLink": "https://collabfund.com/blog/how-i-think-about-debt/",
    "originBody": "How I Think About Debt Apr 30, 2024 SHARE ↓ by Morgan Housel @morganhousel Copy Link Japan has 140 businesses that are at least 500 years old. A few claim to have been operating continuously for more than 1,000 years. It’s astounding to think what these businesses have endured – dozens of wars, emperors, catastrophic earthquakes, tsunamis, depressions, on and on, endlessly. And yet they keep selling, generation after generation. These ultra-durable businesses are called “shinise,” and studies of them show they tend to share a common characteristic: they hold tons of cash, and no debt. That’s part of how they endure centuries of constant calamities. I love the quote from author Kent Nerburn that, “Debt defines your future, and when your future is defined, hope begins to die.” Not only does hope begin to die, but the number of outcomes you can endure does, too. Let’s say this represents volatility over your life. Not just market volatility, but life world and life volatility: recessions, wars, divorces, illness, moves, floods, changes of heart, etc. With no debt, the number of volatile events you can withstand throughout life might fall within a range that looks like this: A few extreme events might do you in, but you’re pretty durable. With more debt, the range of what you can endure shrinks: And with tons of debt, it tightens even more: I think this is the most practical way to think about debt: As debt increases, you narrow the range of outcomes you can endure in life. That’s so simple. But it’s different from how debt is typically viewed, which is a tool to pull forward demand and leverage assets, where the only downside is the cost of capital (the interest rate). Two things are important when you view debt as a narrowing of endurable outcomes. One is you start to ponder how common volatility is. I hope to be around for another 50 years. What are the odds that during those 50 years I will experience one or more of the following: Wars, recessions, terrorist attacks, pandemics, bad political decisions, family emergencies, unforeseen health crises, career transitions, wayward children, and other mishaps? One-hundred percent. The odds are 100%. When you think of it like that, you take debt’s narrowing of survivable outcomes seriously. The other is you think about the kinds of volatile events that could do you in. Financial volatility is an obvious one – you find yourself unable to make your debt payments. But there’s also psychological volatility, where for whatever reason you can’t mentally endure your job any longer. There’s family volatility, which can be anything from divorce to caring for a relative. There’s child volatility, which could fill a book. Health volatility, political volatility, on and on. The world’s a wild place. I’m not an anti-debt zealot. There’s a time and place, and used responsibly it’s a wonderful tool. But once you view debt as narrowing what you can endure in a volatile world, you start to see it as a constraint on the asset that matters most: having options and flexibility.

    "commentBody": "How I think about debt (collabfund.com)199 points by pmzy 20 hours agohidepastfavorite377 comments tombert 19 hours agoI don't think all debt is equal, and I don't think all debt hurts your ability to handle volatility. I have a 30 year mortgage on my house with a 2.75% interest rate. That has effectively given myself \"rent control\"; outside of a potential rise of property taxes, my \"rent\" payment will not exceed a certain number of dollars. That means that if the housing prices rise rapidly, I'm covered. If I had decided not to leverage several hundred thousands of dollars of debt, then yes I'd have more cash directly now, but I might have suffered the fate that lots of others faced with the recent spikes in rent that have happened due to COVID. I simply didn't have to worry about that. Obviously there's different types of debt; some insanely high-interest loan you get from a payday loan place absolutely is a bad and will hurt your ability to stand volatility. reply leononame 19 hours agoparentI think the article still holds up. A financial crisis where you lose your job, a war causing deflation, a housing bubble bursting are all events that could lead to you paying _much_ more than rent. If you can't pay, they'll take your house and everything else until they decide that the debt is paid. In case of a bubble bursting this can mean that you _still_ owe money after they took your house. This has happened to people. I also have a mortgage on my apartment and I also think it's a decent choice, especially considering that I'll have less income after retirement. But most people are only a couple of bad turns in life away of losing everything they own. All in all, I'd say the way to think this article presents does hold up to mortgage as well. reply dmoy 19 hours agorootparent> and everything else Unless you live in a no-recourse state, where they can't take everything else. In AZ, CA, TX, WA, and a handful of other states, banks can't go after your other assets, just the house that's mortgaged. reply PopAlongKid 13 hours agorootparentIn CA, only the original mortgage used to buy your residence is non-recourse. If you refinance, the new mortgage is almost certainly recourse. There is also a similar process, non-judicial foreclosure[0], which is similar to non-recourse in some ways, but not for tax purposes (e.g. cancelation of debt income). [0]https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-foreclosure-work... reply trogdor 18 hours agorootparentprevInteresting. Do you know if mortgage rates in those states are higher, to compensate lenders for the increased risk? reply dmoy 17 hours agorootparentI think it matters a lot more for commercial mortgages. In any event, it's like 20-30bps or less according to the Fed. So higher, but not that much higher even for commercial mortgages, and even less for residential where there's a lot more federal protection going on. The bigger impact, I believe, is that housing prices can go more crazy. People will take more risk if they know they can walk and leave the bank holding the bag, so there isn't that limiting factor on prices. (Though I suspect, but obviously can't confirm, that the effect from non-recourse mortgage is absolutely dwarfed by other factors, especially out here on the west coast where we have very restrictive zoning policies, weaponized environmental policies inside urban areas, etc) reply mikestew 16 hours agorootparentprevWA resident: our mortgage is 2.5% from the credit union. I've not noticed that current rates are any worse than other states I've checked. OTOH, in 25 years of living here, I've never seen house prices go down, only stay steady. reply jp191919 14 hours agorootparentHome prices definitely went down during the great recession. reply AstralStorm 14 hours agorootparentSo did the wages, and those went down more. If you lost a job during that time, you're pretty screwed. reply WalterBright 15 hours agorootparentprev> they'll take your house Yes, and they'll sell the house to cover the debt. But the amount they receive from selling the house in excess of the debt goes to you. I.e. you'll get the equity portion. It's in your mortgage contract. Worth reading. reply AstralStorm 14 hours agorootparentUnless you're backpaid enough so that they take equity in a penalty. And now you're homeless and with your equity you cannot acquire capital. Your credit is also tanked due to the default... Remember, most people do not own multiple houses and having no stable address can really mess you up legally even. reply edmundsauto 14 hours agorootparentWhat would be different in this situation if the person were renting? Usually costs are similar per month for comparable places. I guess the down payment is a difference? But if you’re that far in arrears on rent you’re really still bad off… I don’t feel convinced that having a mortgage debt is that much worse than not having one, if you lose your job and war and other bad things. reply tsimionescu 13 hours agorootparentprevIf your house is still worth enough to cover the debt. If the sale of your house is not enough to cover it (which can happen if you bought during a bubble that burst), will your whole debt at least be forgiven? reply dmoy 12 hours agorootparentIt's not forgiven, even in a non-recourse mortgage. So it can still e.g. hurt your credit score. They just legally can't pursue you for it. With a recourse mortgage, they can go through normal debt channels (including wage garnishment, etc). reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparent\"[R]ecourse mortgage\": It would be better to say \"recourse loan\". Mortgages are specific to properties. Loans are generic for anything. In my personal experience, non-recourse loans are basically payday loans with horribly high rates. You would never do it, if given the choice. I guess that 100% of home mortgages (in highly developed countries) are recourse by legal requirements. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentprevIn short: yes. Imagine you bought a home using a mortgage in the year 2000 in Silicon Valley. Then you go bankrupt in 2007. Your home will probably have appreciated 100-200% during this crazy period. It is very possible you will receive money back from the bank after they sell your home. reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentMy question was specifically about the opposite case, so I'm not sure what your point is. Specifically, I'm asking if the mortgage deals the poster above was discussing would help if the house is now worth less than the mortgage. reply olddustytrail 15 hours agorootparentprevYes but I think they're referring to negative equity. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentprevIf there is a war you leave your house behind. If you rent you can save the difference in a foreign savings account. the point is there is alway risk and many different situations. depending on details there are different results. reply phkahler 18 hours agorootparentprev>> If you can't pay, they'll take your house and everything else until they decide that the debt is paid. This is new. Mortgages in the US traditionally took just the home as collateral. Thanks for the reminder that this is now a thing to look out for, as I may need to borrow one more time than I ever expected. reply Nifty3929 18 hours agorootparentI think it's actually the reverse. The house is the only collateral, but traditionally you would still owe the deficit if the collateral couldn't be sold to pay off the whole loan. This is what's changed in recent decades. A lot (most? all?) primary-residence home loans in the US are non-recourse, meaning that you aren't liable for the deficit - you only lose the house. reply voisin 17 hours agorootparent> A lot (most? all?) primary-residence home loans in the US are non-recourse, meaning that you aren't liable for the deficit - you only lose the house. This is wild. In Canada not only do we all take interest rate risk every 5 years maximum as we can’t lock in for longer (which seems to make our whole society less robust), we can’t refinance early if rates drop without massive penalties eliminating any incentive to do so, but all of our mortgages are full recourse. I can’t believe how much worse this seems, on a societal level, than the US. reply anon7725 17 hours agorootparentA couple of other good points vs Canada: most fixed-rate US mortgages don’t have a prepayment penalty, and many offer the option to “recast”, which means you can make a lump-sum payment and reamortize your loan while keeping the rate and end date the same. This has the effect of lowering your monthly payment and is often used as an alternative to refinancing if you’re buying and selling a home in sequence. reply tzoompy 12 hours agorootparentIn Canada, it's actually worse than stated. You do have a prepayment penalty as long as current interest rates are lower than your loan's interest rate. Now that interest rates are higher than they were a couple of years ago, TD Canada Trust waived all my prepayment penalties. They were happy to let me prepay as much as I wanted. It's incredible how one-sided the Canadian system is. Prepayment is acceptable as long as the bank benefits. Prepayment is not ok when the person taking out the loan benefits. reply voisin 14 hours agorootparentprevThanks for this. I’d never heard of this option and once again I am shocked at how much better Americans have it than Canadians when it comes to mortgages. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentprevYou should ask your parliament to create the equivalent of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in your country. Gov't backed and buys loans from retail/commercial banks under strict guidelines. This helps to create a huge fixed rate mortgage market in the United States. I agree: Fixed rate mortgages are terrific for increasing home ownership. Plus, it moves the interest rate risk from retail people (less sophisticated) to institutions (banks, etc.) (more sophisticated). reply ckcheng 14 hours agorootparentprev> In Canada ... all of our mortgages are full recourse. Except in Saskatchewan and Alberta [1]. [1]: https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-es... reply voisin 9 hours agorootparentWow thanks for sharing. I had no idea. reply intuitionist 15 hours agorootparentprevI mean, manufacturing 30-year fixed rate fully pre-payable non-recourse mortgages does not happen in a free market. It takes a lot of government subsidies to make that happen—in particular the government assumes the credit risk on something like 85% of US mortgages. The United States government is very into the idea of spending its resources to subsidize homeownership. Canada has made different policy decisions, like single-payer healthcare. If the societal choice was between universal healthcare and extremely borrower-friendly mortgages (and I don’t think that it really works that way, at least not in such stark terms) I’m not sure I’d pick the mortgages. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentIt can happen. There is risk, but the reward is very high and so it is worth it. However the government often will not allow you to get the full reward and so while the numbers work out for everhone in a free market it doesn't happen. adjustable rate mortgages in the us are lower interest rate. Often in the us they are a better deal - we are just looking at one case where everyone in a fixed rate two years ago is better off than those with adjustable rates. reply voisin 14 hours agorootparentprev> It takes a lot of government subsidies to make that happen No doubt, but the upside is a populace not especially at risk to interest rates which is absolutely crushing and systemically risky currently. > in particular the government assumes the credit risk on something like 85% of US mortgages. In Canada, CMHC does something similar so I am not sure we get away with anything special that the Americans are not. reply WalterBright 15 hours agorootparentprevI read my mortgage papers carefully before signing. I made sure there was no early payoff penalty. This worked out fine when interest rates dropped and I refi'd. I've refi'd many times whenever the interest rate dips :-/ reply voisin 14 hours agorootparentIn Canada? Who was your lender? I did an exhaustive (I thought!) search when I last got a mortgage and could not find a fixed rate option that did not have a large prepayment penalty. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentIn the US. I don't know much of anything about Canada. reply AstralStorm 14 hours agorootparentprevThat is just the mortgage. I assume that you also defaulted on media and anything else you had on credit, such as student loans. And those do not have such nice terms either. reply galdosdi 19 hours agoparentprevThe way I think about this is: You already are in \"debt\" by being alive. You have the huge liabilities of needing food and housing and maybe sometimes some healthcare, in order to stay alive. By buying a perpetual source of one of those you aren't investing or expanding your liabilities-- just the opposite, you are hedging against and closing out your liability by prepaying for it. To take this idea further, this is why I think buying a little bit of stock in energy and agriculture companies is \"risk free\" because while they could go down if those things get cheaper, you would then win out as a consumer. You will need food and energy down the line anyway, so a modest investment in those closes out that hedge rather than expanding liability reply anon7725 17 hours agorootparentThere are lots of ways that stock in food and energy companies could go down while prices go up. A drought or pipeline disruption come to mind. reply yowlingcat 15 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. And I think the same is true for the commodities market correlates there; if memory serves correctly, crude commodity futures went negative for a break period during the supply chain volatility spike during the beginning of the pandemic. reply phaedrus 16 hours agoparentprevBesides taxes, there is another sense in which outside circumstances can break your \"rent control\" model of home ownership with 30 year mortgage. Here in Oklahoma, insurance rates have skyrocketed in the last couple years. I now pay more in homeowner's insurance monthly than either my principle or interest payment (though perhaps not both together - yet). And I have a 4.something% mortgage. I suspect it has or will soon reach the point where the Kelly criterion says mathematically I'd be better off to self-insure - if I didn't have a bank loan. It's not just insurance (which is likely also weather-related); after a fluke super-cold Winter we had, our natural gas companies incurred a huge wholesale market bill which they've passed on to customers. I have a family member who owns his house free and clear whose gas bill went up so much he could no longer afford to heat his house. The gas company still tried / is trying to assess a one-time very large retroactive fixed fee even though he turned off his gas. My point, I guess, being even homeowners are not totally insulated from being screwed over by outside market forces. reply Kirby64 15 hours agorootparentAssuming it's market condition based and not specific to your house, rents would easily pass along insurance rate hikes to you as well. I don't see much difference in insulation from that for renting vs. buying. reply jjav 2 hours agorootparentprev> Here in Oklahoma, insurance rates have skyrocketed in the last couple years. Insurance company profiteering is a disaster but that's a whole different topic. But remember that rental properties are also insured. And the renter is paying for that insurance, it's just bundled in the rental price. So renters are also paying the wild insurance hikes. And utilities like gas are generally directly paid by renters, so no difference. reply pixl97 14 hours agorootparentprev>I suspect it has or will soon reach the point where the Kelly criterion says mathematically I'd be better off to self-insure Heh wait till you go to replace the property/damage. Unless you're doing yourself you'd absolutely crap on the floor once you see how high prices have got for this work. Add to this the increasing incidence of weather/climate related damages to homes and the situation isn't looking good for many states. reply r00fus 4 hours agorootparentprev> Here in Oklahoma, insurance rates have skyrocketed in the last couple years. I thought this was only a problem in CA or FL. I wonder if this is nationwide or specific to states with disaster prone areas. reply nicbou 15 hours agorootparentprevIn Berlin, only a small percentage of landlords beat inflation. It's a lot of work and a low return for an illiquid investment. Depending on the timing, many qualify housing as a lifestyle decision instead of an investment. Aside from what you've mentioned, the state can raise the efficiency standard to protect the environment, raise the cost of services, or make you pay to rebuild the street or sidewalk in front of your home. Then come the maintenance: new roof, new windows, new kitchen and so on. If your country has good tenant rights, there are not so many reasons to buy. It's better to invest the money for a while. reply GenerocUsername 15 hours agorootparentprevYou don't HAVE to carry home insurance do you? You can also change policies for different levels of insurance at any time. It's not exactly a debt, but an ongoing service reply dhosek 15 hours agorootparentIf you have a mortgage, you are required to insure the building at the least. reply tombert 15 hours agorootparentprevI am pretty sure that at least in NY you are required to have insurance if you have a mortgage. I guess once the mortgage is paid off for whatever reason you’re welcome to not get insurance. reply quadyeast 15 hours agorootparentprevBanks want to insure the collateral. reply HeyLaughingBoy 14 hours agorootparentTo the point where if they're notified that your insurance has lapsed, they will warn you to get replacement coverage, or they will and then bill you for it. I had a not so fun experience with switching insurance providers at about the same time that my bank was about to make the insurance payment out of escrow. reply tombert 13 hours agorootparentThat was something we had to worry about when buying our house. The house I have is pretty old and the roof had some issues. I obviously was planning on fixing those, but it became a bit of a catch-22 problem; the insurance I was planning on using (cuz I had a discount from my employer) said that they wouldn't insure me until the roof was thoroughly fixed and/or replaced, but I couldn't fix the roof until the deal closed, and the mortgage company wouldn't close the deal until we had insurance. We were afraid we'd have to pay the insane insurance rates from the mortgage company. Fortunately, after multiple days of shopping, I found one insurance company that agreed to insure me as long as I fixed the roof within 30 days of closing, which I did. reply vel0city 13 hours agorootparentI had a similar issue with buying a house. In the end we just wrote the roof replacement into the contingency of the contract and adjusted the price a bit so both sides paid a little bit into the cost of the new roof. The roof was replaced, we got our insurance, and the house was sold. reply francisofascii 19 hours agoparentprevPeople don't realize how risky housing is compared to other investments. It is risky because it is SO MUCH MONEY and it is not diversified at all. If your house loses half its value, that represents hundreds of thousands in losses. And don't think that can't happen. You buy a penny stock for $2K and lose half, no big deal compared to your house. BUT, we need housing, we need a stable school for our kids, or a comfortable place for our partner, etc. So we have to take this risk. reply pdonis 15 hours agorootparentBut your primary home isn't an investment, it's a necessity. You're going to live somewhere. The only choice you have is whether to buy or rent the place you live in. So that's the comparison that should be made. Comparing your primary home to your stock portfolio is pointless because you can't live in your stock portfolio. The GP is pointing out a key advantage of buying your primary home vs. renting: you're not exposed to the risk of rising rents. Others have pointed out disadvantages, such as being exposed to the risk of rising property taxes and rising insurance costs. How those things balance out is going to depend a lot on where your home is. reply dehrmann 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you ask a financial advisor for advice on investing half your net worth on 5x leverage in an liquid asset with one customer and one location, they'd think you're crazy. reply edmundsauto 18 hours agorootparentBut most of them would not think you’re crazy once it’s specified to real estate. This means either financial professionals are blind to the similarities or there is something critical missing from your description. reply sokoloff 17 hours agorootparentprevWhen that one customer is \"your family\", it's a little bit different, though.

The average estate value, excluding land, houses, and cars, is about $900. I have friends who ran an estate liquidation service. You'd net something like 5 cents on the dollar.

This is most of where its monetary value comes from (obviously not universally true, many properties have simply become investments), and its monetary value would probably only completely evaporate if the house were so degraded that it could not function as a shelter. The monetary value of most houses is rooted in their ability fulfill a basic human need, as opposed to the monetary value of some other things, like gold or bitcoin, which are valuable primarily because of what they are worth to other people.

Of course there is intrinsic value. A buyer has to pay you what you want for your house. You are setting the market price. If someone wants it, thats what they will need to give you. We often use the word “worth” to mean “what would be the best offer I might get. But you won’t sell it if it is “worth” more than that to you. Which “worth” is usually obvious from context. Valuations happen on both sides of every trade, and most often both participants end up with surplus value. The seller getting more than their minimum price, the buyer paying less than their maximum price. Even market makers commonly post prices with surplus relative to their neutral trade valuation, and typically move their price if their are no takers. They want a trade at X, but will try for as much surplus as they can before settling for X if they have to. reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparent> A buyer has to pay you what you want for your house.

There are plenty of things which are valuable or bring value, but are never sold or bought. Case in point: how much is the Sun worth according to you? reply Nevermark 1 hour agorootparentI don’t have any ability to make choices about it that depend on any conscious valuation. But do you doubt I value it because I am not buying or selling it? I suppose near infinite, in that I would certainly sacrifice everything I have to protect it - given it represents the survival of all of us - which for me at least would be the apex of value. It is worth noting that value can often be measured in currency, but not always. It is ultimately an ordering of everything, by kind and quantity. In the end, even money is just another “thing” which we value on a gradient and relative to context (what we need to survive, we value a lot. To live Without stress, a lot, but less. More than that, even less, even if we are ambitious.) Market value comes directly from each of our personal, “intrinsic” as another commenter called it, valuations. There is no market value where there are no personal valuations. But there can be personal valuations where there is no market. Each of us still prioritizes what we have against what we want, and the costs to us of that, even if we were hermits. Each of spends our time, the ultimate resource, based on our relative values of things. That is the source of all “value” or “worth”. Individual or (and before) collective. reply WalterBright 15 hours agorootparentprevHouses have always been a lousy investment for me. Once you factor in all the costs (property tax, insurance, repairs, 6% real estate commissions, the time the house sits empty waiting for a buyer, etc.) the returns are not that good at all. Most people think: \"I bought my house for $200,000 and sold it for $300,000, I made $100,000!!!!!\" and neglect to do a proper accounting. reply Kirby64 15 hours agorootparentAnyone buying a house with a mortgage generally is taking a 5:1 leverage (a 5% down loan is 20:1 leverage) position on the house. Making $100k on a $200k investment, with 5:1 leverage means making 100k on a 40k investment, which isn't a 50% return... it's a 250% return. And it's tax free, assuming it's your primary residence (up to 250k cap gains). You have to spend an obnoxious amount on costs to not have it make sense. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentRemember, leverage works both ways. reply Kirby64 14 hours agorootparentObviously. Which is why 20:1 leverage (5% down) is kind of foolish, since you can quickly become underwater on a house purchase if the value shifts. At 5:1 leverage though, you still maintain enough equity to weather any valuation swings if you have a need to leave and sell the house. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentThis post is somewhat misleading. If you put 0% down (yes, it is possible in many places), effectively you have infinite leverage. But let's use your 5% example. If you house price falls by 50%, nothing happens to you -- even with huge negative equity. You keep making monthly payments. There is no \"weathering\" to be done. Sure, at the end, you might have a giant paper loss, but you still have a roof over your head -- that you own. reply temporarara 14 hours agorootparentprevWhile there is some \"leverage\" in mortgage, you actually need to pay the whole sum, and with interest too, so taking a $200k loan means you pay usually something like $250k for it in the end, and this means you have to make $50k profit to not lose. And houses age too. If the location is superb you can justify it as an investment, otherwise it's pure nonsense in every way. Thinking normal housing as an investment is one of those reasons why we can't have nice things. reply jjav 2 hours agorootparent> and this means you have to make $50k profit to not lose No, it doesn't. Because the alternative was renting, which isn't free. Even if you end up losing 50K on the home, all told, but if renting for the same number of years would've cost you 100K, you're ahead by 50K. reply Kirby64 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you think leverage means? If I take a leveraged position on a stock via margin trading and the stock goes to $0 (or, more realistically, it dips in value enough that I get a margin call) then I owe the whole balance, not just what I put up as capital. This is true of literally any leverage. And on top of that, I pay a margin rate in the form of an interest payment based on the amount of money I have outstanding beyond my capital. Sounds familiar, right? Because it's exactly identical. The only difference between a mortgage and a margin interest payment is that a mortage is amoritized across the term and is a fixed period, whereas margin interest is indefinite and acts more like a HELOC (i.e., you only pay interest on the amount that you have outstanding... and that amount can vary over time). I absolutely hate the idea that \"paying X in interest means that's money you have to earn in addition to make it worthwhile\". No, it's not. It's money you are paying to free up extra capital elsewhere that can be invested more efficiently. Unless you're spending well beyond your means (which, admittedly, some people do), then paying interest on a mortgage payment should mean making much much more elsewhere by investing money you would have spent on buying a house in cash. reply temporarara 11 hours agorootparentYou HAVE to pay back your debt if you want to pocket all your profits. If your down payment is 25k and you buy 250k house, you need to borrow 225k for your \"leverage\". Now you get lucky and years later, AFTER you have paid 25k + 225k + interest + fees which amounts to at least 300k, prices have gone up and you can sell that house for 400k. Nice you think! I will make 375k profit just by investing 25k! NO, that's not how \"leverage\" works at all. At that point you have paid at least 300k to get 400k which makes not that great considering it's been 20 years or so. The logic you are using is flawed beyond all reasoning to be honest. People who are in a position to both pay back their mortgages AND invest heavily elsewhere are already rich. reply Kirby64 11 hours agorootparentYou don't make 375k in profit off a 25k investment (in your example) if you sell a house for 400k. You would make 125k in profit using your numbers (minus fees, interest, etc). It's exactly how leverage works, and the equivalent in margin trading is 100% identical. The only difference with a mortgage is that you slowly deleverage yourself over time as a consequence of paying off the loan (principal that goes to value of the loan). As an example, if you sold a house 5 years into owning it, at current interest rates, you would only have paid down approximately 6% of the 30 year loan, so the 'leverage' of a 20% down loan would still be ~4.8:1. reply Dylan16807 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat you're skipping in this equation is that the amount of leverage drops every month when you make your payment. The average leverage is a lot lower than the starting leverage. That's what makes a mortgage pretty different from a leveraged trade. > Unless you're spending well beyond your means (which, admittedly, some people do), then paying interest on a mortgage payment should mean making much much more elsewhere by investing money you would have spent on buying a house in cash.

What I didn't like about his take was that it also kind of also excluded getting into like $20,000-$40,000 of debt to go to a decent state school. That's a bad take; getting a degree (at least in a technical field) substantially increases your earning potential, and while $40,000 is a lot of money, it's not out of reach for virtually anyone working in tech or engineering or something adjacent, at least not in the US. I guess my frustration with his perspective is that it felt extremely reductive; he acts like the only student loan debt you can get into is Harvard-level stuff, but I think that's just not true, and not even the average case. Most people don't get into Harvard, (I think) most people who go to college end up at a state or local university, and as such they're not getting into the obscene levels of debt that you'd get from these yuppie private schools, particularly if they state within state. reply somenameforme 14 hours agorootparentYou age is showing a bit with your post. Randomly picking Penn State you get annual costs of $60k+ for out-of-state and $40k+ for in-state. [1] The cost listed on the page is only for tuition/housing. Use the calculator to get estimates for everything else. And that's an anti-cherry picked example, as I wanted to avoid absurdly expensive places like California, but while also going for a well regarded school. You can easily get well into the 6 figures of debt even at state schools now. You'll find even rando state universities are hitting $30k+/year. Education costs have done exactly what you'd expect them to do when you convince people something is priceless and then give them unlimited and near unconditional loans to buy it. I don't really see the point in this when you can instead attend English language programs in e.g. Europe or Asia and pay less for your entire education than you'd pay for a semester at rando state school in the US. Do a work-study program and you could graduate with a tidy chunk of change saved up, instead of graduating buried in enough debt to buy a house. The ironic part is that this advice is even more pertinent for those coming from low income backgrounds, or from parents with limited education. But they're probably the people most unlikely to take advantage of such options, if not only because they probably just don't consider it. [1] - https://admissions.psu.edu/costs-aid/tuition/ reply tombert 14 hours agorootparentFair enough, but in fairness not all state schools are created equal. For example, at least one SUNY college (SUNY Empire) is only about $3,535 per semester (at least for tuition) for in-state [1], so assuming eight semesters roughly $30,000. I grew up in Florida, and the first college I went to was Florida State, and tuition is roughly $5,500 as of last year for in-state [2]. I feel like there are plenty of options for perfectly decent universities that fall roughly into that price range I specified in most states, so I think my point still stands. That said, I'm a huge fan of European/UK universities. I do graduate school in the UK, it's a lot cheaper than a comparable program in a lot of American universities.

If your loans have a minimum payment and a penalty for missing a payment above and beyond interest (which seems to be common for loans in the US), the snowball method gives you more flexibility. Paying off a loan completely eliminates that part of your monthly minimum payment. If in 2 or 5 years your income decreases unexpectedly (layoff, etc.), but by that point you've completely eliminated 1 or more loans, you're more likely to be able to continue making minimum payments. reply throw0101d 19 hours agoparentprev> I have a 30 year mortgage on my house with a 2.75% interest rate. The author on paying down his mortgage: > It just increased our independence, even if it made no sense on paper. So that's another element of debt that I think goes misunderstood. And a lot of that for both of those points is this idea that people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They don't make them in Excel. They make financial decisions at the dinner table. That's where they're talking about their goals and their own different personalities and their own unique fears and their own unique skills and whatnot. So that's why I kind of push people to say like, it's okay to make financial decisions that don't make any sense on paper if they work for you, if they check the boxes of your psychology and your goals that makes sense for you.

Rent has increased 30-50% where I live over the same time period. At least when my property tax increases, it's because I have an asset that has increased in value. If I am at some point forced to sell because I can no longer afford the property taxes, then I'll walk away with more money than if I had been paying rent for those same years.

If OP moves, they now only have to take on a smaller mortgage for their new home and then keep paying that new mortgage off. The goal is that by the time you reach retirement age, you have paid off the mortgage and own your home free and clear. Thus, you only have to pay the property taxes and have more financial security than someone who never built up equity because they always paid rent. Furthermore, if you have children, that home is potentially a source of generational wealth. They can sell it after you pass and invest the proceeds, or live in it themselves if they want. Worst case, if you find you didn't save enough for retirement, you can tap into the home equity to keep food on the table, although this is not optimal. reply pmg101 14 hours agorootparentIsn't the common use case that the equity in your home can be exchanged for elder care in your latter years? reply psunavy03 13 hours agorootparentDepends on the size of someone's nest egg.

When I'm paying my mortgage payments, I'm building some degree of equity into the house, so the only \"wasted\" money is whatever I pay to interest. So my plan if I move is exactly what it sounds like: I sell the house and then buy a new one wherever I'm moving to. As long as I'm staying for like 5+ years at that location I think it's still worth it. reply coldpie 19 hours agorootparentprevSure, why not? I can't speak for OP specifically, but generally living in the same house for decades is very common. I'm coming up on 15 years in my house with no plans to move, and most of my neighbors have been there even longer. My parents lived in the house I grew up in for 40 years until my father passed away and my mom needed to downsize.

(where I live even multi-year tenants are frequently forbidden from putting up pictures on the walls, let alone repainting them, FFS). In places with proper rental rights, rent vs buy is a lot less clear-cut, especially if prices don't have much room to go up any further (buying only looks like a non-brainer financially in the past decade's environment of extreme price increases, or if you fail to consider opportunity costs. Even if you can afford to buy a house, it's not necessarily the best use of your money, but the non-financial side can be a really big part of why people go for it anyway). reply sgerenser 10 hours agorootparentWhere is anyone forbidden from putting up pictures on the walls? 99.9% of residential rental contracts just state that the dwelling has to be returned in the condition rented.

For most things, that's a wise philosophy. Going into debt for something that depreciates like cars or furniture or electronics, is not wise. Housing is different though for several reasons. One is that you must live somewhere. So (unless being homeless in an option) you have to pay for housing one way or the other. So you either buy (build equity) or rent (a pure expense). Another reason is that a house may (often does) appreciate in value so you're leveraging that debt to make money. Even if it depreciates, it hardly ever depreciates faster than paying rent. Another reason is that rents always go up, a mortgage locks in your cost for the next 30 years. reply t0bia_s 4 hours agorootparentprevI agree. I think current economical \"norm\" of having debt is made for purpose by states and banks.

With price of loosing our freedom with every new regulations. reply zharknado 7 hours agorootparentprevI think halal mortgages are instructive on this point. To be clear, I’m not Muslim nor a lending expert, I just think it’s a really interesting setup. As I understand it, sharia law forbids paying interest, so a conventional mortgage is not an option for adherents. However, several different mechanisms are allowed by which the purchaser gradually gains full ownership of the home. E.g. one is roughly equivalent to a rent-to-own agreement. The financier still gains a profit that reflects the risk their upfront investment is subject to. What I find interesting is a recognition that some people need a lot of time to attain homeownership, and it may be valuable to let them live in the home before they fully achieve it, despite the outright rejection of lending as the mechanism. reply dheera 5 hours agorootparentWell damn, can I just take out $10M in personal loans, tell them my religion doesn't believe in paying interest, buy Treasury bonds with it, and live off the interest? reply dtx1 2 hours agorootparentIf you find someone who lends you 10M interest free sure reply jjcm 11 hours agorootparentprev> I never understood buying things that I can't afford.

Lending generally enables this. Avoiding debt entirely is a very risk-averse strategy. As ridiculous as house prices are, they are still generally affordable for many (and whether renting or buying is a better overall financial decision is dependent on many factors which depend on your location, how long you expect to own the house, and your risk profile for real estate vs any other kind of investment. Factors like rental rights can also factor pretty heavily). reply dheera 12 hours agorootparentWhy is avoiding debt a risk averse strategy? I actually do a lot of high risk investments with a small percentage of my net worth -- bitcoin, options, you name it. But I do it with hard cash to my name. If I lose a chunk of that I don't owe anyone anything. I just never thought spending someone else's money and then owing them was even anywhere close to my moral radar of things I would do. The only one time I took a debt is for a car when I had the cash to buy it but it was 2022 and I took a loan at 2% and put the balance of the car in treasury and municipal bonds at ~5% and paying back the loan slowly while selling off the bonds. I wouldn't take a loan if I didn't have the money. Before I could afford a car I just rented cars. reply LouisSayers 12 hours agorootparent> Why is avoiding debt a risk averse strategy? Note that they said avoiding ALL debt. For example, my student loan collects interest at a rate of 2.9%. Therefore, it makes sense to maintain that debt if I believe (and accept the risk) of making an investment that pays back a rate of 10%. Financially it might make sense to keep that debt, pay the minimum and invest cash into let's say an index fund. If you have a hardline stance that you NEVER want any debt, then you are basically saying you're highly risk averse (at least when it comes to ending up in the negative). reply rcxdude 12 hours agorootparentprevbecause the risk with debt is not being able to pay it back - and you are paying the lender for their side of that risk (generally paying less the more of that risk falls on your side, like secured debt). It's a service they are freely offering (and in fact benefits them disproportionately on average), I don't see how it's a moral issue at all. reply dheera 12 hours agorootparentThe moral issue I have is that simply put, if I don't have the money for something, I wasn't meant to have that something. I need to earn the money for it, after which I deserve to have that something. However, the most basic clean-and-functional versions of basic necessities (food, water, shelter, and transportation) should be accessible to everyone working a full-time job, in my opinion, without having to spend other peoples' money. 3 out of those 4 are attainable even with a low-paying job, it's really just shelter that is the problem. reply rcxdude 12 hours agorootparentDo you believe that taking investment is immoral as well, then? That access to resources should be entirely based on past work/achievements, with no judgement applied to anything to be done in the future? That does seem to be the standard you are applying to yourself, at least. (And again, I do agree that housing is incredibly overpriced in much of the world, it's just that debt vs not doesn't have much to do with it.

No, it isn't -- \"much of the world\". It is overpriced in tiny areas (with incredibly vibrant local economies) of very wealthy countries. Even if you leave Paris, 25+km outside of the city, the property is suddenly reasonably priced. Same for Berlin. (Forget London!) Same for Tokyo. Same for Milan. Also, mostly we have our parents' generation to blame for outrageous house prices in these tiny areas -- they consistently supported and voted for NIMBY-friendly policies. The solution is \"simple\", but, politically, very difficult to implement: Make housing a human right, not a casino. reply dheera 5 hours agorootparentprevInvestment is different. In the worst case scenario business goes bankrupt, which usually means you shut down the entity, sell off the assets, and everyone including the owners just go off and gets new jobs and live happily ever after.

You're thinking of debt as a consumer. Like, take a personal loan or credit card debt and buy a big screen TV. Yes, that's dumb. Not all debt is like that. Picture this scenario: Your bank pays 5% interest on deposits. You're offered a loan from somewhere for an interest rate of 4.9%. It is a no-brainer to take that loan, go into debt, for as much as possible! Deposit it into your bank account and profit each month. If the rates change such that the bank pays less, just pay off the loan. Now, sure, that's a simplistic scenario since nobody will offer you a loan for less than the banks are paying interest right now. But with time being another variable, you can manouver yourself into that situation. Right now my bank pays more interest than the percentage I pay on my mortgage balance. I'm literally making money every month by having debt.

If you are mugged and the thief gets $100, does that make you $100 less deserving?

I agree that \"meant to have\" and \"deserve\" are the wrong concepts here. But reality and practicality are what they are. If I work hard and save my earnings, with the intention to buy something which we agree is a \"valid\" need/want (whatever that something is), and then lose the money through some circumstance that we we agree is \"not my fault\", that really sucks and I don't claim that it affects how much I \"deserve\" the thing (whatever deserve means), but the reality is that I now don't have the money to buy that thing. Am I going to now borrow money because \"I worked hard and I deserve it\"? Some would, others wouldn't. reply wyre 11 hours agorootparentprev>As ridiculous as house prices are, they are still generally affordable for many What? Technically this is true because “many” people already own homes and can use that wealth towards another. However, when talking about the unafordability of homes the target market being discussed should be first-time home buyers (unless you have an investment podcast or something).

My main point is that if you can afford the mortgage, you can afford the house, you don't need to be able to make a cash payment for it to afford it.

This is a societal failure. reply jjav 2 hours agorootparent> I refuse to go into debt by taking out a loan for a house But you are renting. While renting isn't debt, it can be helpful to think of it as debt you have to pay every month (unless you plan to be homeless). So you have 12N (where N is the number of years you think you might still live) of rent debt payments that you are committed to pay. If you transform that into mortgage payments, at least you're building equity. And it will only be 1230 payments (given a 30 year mortgage) so it is a bounded number unlike 12*N. reply prawn 9 hours agorootparentprevA mortgage as a tool is available to you. If you refuse to go into debt, is that societal failure? Affordability of housing is a serious issue, but I'm not sure expecting to buy property without debt is necessarily so. It seems like a self-defeating position to take? reply throw0101d 19 hours agoprevThe author of the article, Morgan Housel, is also the author of the book The Psychology of Money. This thoughts on, e.g., paying down his mortgage: > It just increased our independence, even if it made no sense on paper. So that's another element of debt that I think goes misunderstood. And a lot of that for both of those points is this idea that people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They don't make them in Excel. They make financial decisions at the dinner table. That's where they're talking about their goals and their own different personalities and their own unique fears and their own unique skills and whatnot. So that's why I kind of push people to say like, it's okay to make financial decisions that don't make any sense on paper if they work for you, if they check the boxes of your psychology and your goals that makes sense for you. And for me, extreme aversion, what looks like an irrational aversion today, and I would say is an irrational aversion to debt, is what works for me and what makes me happy, so that's why I've done it. * https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/128 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSaRb-iFwPA reply eadmund 18 hours agoparent> > it's okay to make financial decisions that don't make any sense on paper if they work for you I consider that to be (mostly) pernicious nonsense, like ‘it’s okay to walk off of a cliff, if that works for you.’ To a very great degree, finances are a mathematical/legal reality: the path of wisdom is to adjust one’s emotions to that reality rather than to imagine that reality matches one’s emotions. There is some degree of truth to it, of course: at the end of the day, life is not about maximising one’s finances, and one’s emotions definitely have a role to play in one’s happiness. But the sooner one learns to defer immediate gratification, save for the future and build up a nest egg, the happier one is likely to be. reply jonfw 15 hours agorootparentI know someone who recently retired, sold his expensive home, and bought a new home in a cheaper area outright with cash. He had a fixed income that would easily cover his living expenses. He had an investment portfolio that he is planning to pass on to his family. By investing his cash and getting a mortgage on his home- he certainly would have made enough money to cover his mortgage on interest. But, he'd be at risk of going cash flow negative, and having to liquidate some of his investments to cover his mortgage + lifestyle. He knew that having to liquidate investments would bother him- it'd be a lot harder to justify that vacation if he'd have to sell some stocks. Those stocks are for his family in his mind. By buying that home outright, he now knows that he's going to be cash flow positive for as long as he's alive. He'll never have to dip into his stocks. And he'll never have to stretch a dollar. It's not a strategy that you'd come up with on a spreadsheet, but he's one of the happiest guys I know reply al_borland 9 hours agorootparentprevThe math equations play out differently based on the physiology. When I got my home I went crazy trying to pay it off as fast as possible. I did it in 30 months and it was the best feeling in the world. I deferred my immediate happiness on many things for almost 3 years to hit that goal and it was euphoric. Since doing that, I’ve been able to increase my savings rate dramatically. I save much more now than I would be saving if I still had a mortgage and made minimum payments. My net worth jumped up considerably during that period, since I had a clearly defined goal just around the corner it was easy to give up more for it. Now it’s easy to give more to investments because I don’t really want for anything and my expenses are low. When nothing is competing for your dollars it is easy to start stacking them up. I was also maxing out my 401k while paying off the home, so it’s not like I wasn’t investing or completely out of the market. Most people paying the minimum on their “good debt” aren’t aggressively investing what they otherwise would have applied. They’re spending the money and have nothing to show for it at the end of the day. The potential investment is the justification to not pay the debt, but it’s not the reality of what they’re doing. I find a lot of peace knowing that if something happens to my job, I can probably get a job just about anywhere and still make ends meet. My emergency fund also went from 6 months of expenses to 12 months without adding another dime, but by eliminating my biggest expense. Another thing I thought about a lot was the 2008 crash. If I were to not pay down my house, and invest instead, I could still end up in a situation where I lost my job and with the markets down, couldn’t afford to stay in or get out of my house if needed. Paying it off eliminates that risk. Property taxes for the whole year are about equal to 2 months of rent in most places around me. I love businesses that are 100s of years old. They may not be the biggest, but they don’t need to be huge to weather the storms of life, they just need deep roots. That’s what I want for my life. Stability. Investments can buy some flexibility when times are good, but a paid off home will give me a place to rest easy when times are bad. reply ZephyrBlu 12 hours agorootparentprevA financial strategy is worthless if you don't follow it.

    "title": "Pifex: DIY JTAG Hacking with Raspberry Pi",
    "originLink": "https://voidstarsec.com/blog/jtag-pifex",
    "originBody": "Home JTAG Hacking with a Raspberry Pi - Introducing the PiFex May 2024 Overview When performing initial hardware analysis and recon, I have become very fond of using Armbian-based single-board computers (SBCs) for things like UART, SPI, I2C, JTAG, and SWD. One of the main benefits of using one of these boards is that since the peripherals we are interested in are exposed as character devices in Linux, a wide variety of tools are available for interfacing with them, including most programming and scripting languages. However, one of the biggest hurdles that stop people from using an Armbian-based device is the initial setup and configuration (not to mention availability!). It takes more time to configure an Orange Pi or Raspberry Pi and enable the various interfaces than plug in an FTDI to your Linux machine. This blog post will help break down some of those barriers and streamline the setup process for those looking to learn hardware hacking with a Linux SBC. With this blog post, we’ll introduce the PiFex, a basic companion board for the Raspberry Pi designed to teach users the basics of hardware hacking and embedded protocols. We will then demonstrate how to use the PiFex to access a JTAG tap on an undocumented SSD, allowing memory reads and GDB access to the SSD CPU. Note: The design and software for the PiFex will be open-sourced in the coming months as we continue our final rounds of testing Background Information If you are unfamiliar with JTAG at a low level, you might want to read my previous blog post about reverse engineering JTAG taps. PiFex: An Overview The Pi Interface Explorer or PiFex, is a simple hat for a Raspberry Pi designed for tinkerers and hardware hackers alike. By breaking out the commonly used interfaces and routing them through bi-directional level shifters, we aimed to streamline some of the initial steps when reverse engineering a new device or trying to learn how a new sensor works. While this device was initially designed for use during our hardware hacking bootcamp it has quickly become my go-to when performing initial hardware assessments of COTS devices. The PCB is well documented, and the IO pins are all labeled as shown in the image below: We also have added an I2C OLED screen, which you can customize using the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries: PiFex: Hardware The PiFex exposes the following interfaces to the end user: UART via IO14 and IO15 SPI via IO8, IO9, IO10 and IO11 I2C via IO2 and IO3 JTAG via IO2,IO3,IO14 and IO15 SWD via IO9 and IO11 There are also an additional eight GPIO pins. These interfaces were chosen because they are the ones that we utilize in our hardware hacking training and are also the most likely to be used by tinkerers and hardware hackers for other projects. Logic Analyzer Connector When reverse engineering a target device or inspecting why your custom code controlling a specific peripheral isn’t working, a logic analyzer is your best friend. To help simplify the wiring for both our training and standard usage, we also added a logic analyzer connector. This was done to remediate potential wiring issues and make debugging and troubleshooting as easy as possible. An interface board was designed to connect to entry-level logic analyzers that can be seen in the image below: This helps streamline connecting a logic analyzer to the PiFex and analyzing the transmitted or monitored signals. Level Shifter(s) The Raspberry PI uses 3.3V logic levels, meaning it can only communicate with devices that use that same logic level. If we want to connect to a device that uses lower voltages (1.8V and 1.2V are becoming increasingly common), we need to route those through a level shifter. To streamline this and help reduce issues with wiring during our training, we’ve added two onboard level shifters. We chose to use the TXB0108 Bi-Directional level shifters; these allow us to communicate with devices at a voltage below 3.3V. In the case where a different logic level is needed, the user can select whether to use an external voltage source for the input voltage using the VCCA_IN line on the exposed headers. The level shifter then references this voltage by toggling the selector switch at the top of the board to VCCA_IN as opposed to the default state, which is 3.3V. PiFex: Software If you’ve ever had to set up a headless Raspberry Pi before, you know that it’s not always a simple task, and when performing remote training, we can’t assume that everyone will be able to manually configure their Pi to connect to their network. This is why we designed the PiFex image to use a USB-Ethernet gadget on startup to present an Ethernet device to the end user over USB. This results in an easy, predictable way to connect to the Pi. After plugging the Pi into their machine, all the user needs to do is set the IP address, and they are all set. A short video walking through the web interface can be seen below: As mentioned in the previous section, one of the initial hurdles when learning about embedded protocols is selecting what tool or interface you want to learn with. Embedded development boards like the Arduino series or STM32 series are great but require setting up a development environment and understanding the specifics of the target microcontroller. One of the benefits of using an embedded Linux board is that these interfaces are exposed via /dev/ and can be accessed using many programming languages such as Python, Rust, C, and even bash. Jupyter Notebooks Throughout our training, we utilize Jupyter Notebooks to help streamline the process and provide students with template notebooks for future assessments. For example, the JTAG notebook contains instructions and tooling to perform: JTAG Scan Chain Detection via go-jtagenum Example UrJTAG Python Bindings for low-level scan chain access Example OpenOCD configurations and Python bindings for scripting JTAG operations Screenshots of the included notebooks can be seen below: While in class, we will use all of these features on our target, and students will be able to copy this notebook and use the same tools and techniques for future targets. Last but certainly not least, we’ve configured the PiFex image to allow access to standard tools such as SSH and FTP. Now that we’ve reviewed the PiFex’s features and intended use case, let’s reverse-engineer the JTAG TAP for an undocumented target! PiFex Demo 1 : JTAG So, we’ve talked about our new hardware tooling. How about a demonstration of it in action? Let’s start with a low-cost SSD purchased on AliExpress. If we break down the hardware, we have the following: Component Part Number Datasheet / Information 1 SM2259XT Advertisement / Basic Information 2 SPS64472LBTH2 NA - 64GB NAND Flash 3 50.00 MHz Oscilator 4 NA 10 pin debug header After searching for datasheets, we were not able to locate much; however, next, we will investigate the mystery header at the end of the board. Let’s start by looking at this debug connector at the end of the drive. First, we will attempt to identify the ground connection. To do this, we will use our multimeter in continuity mode and test against a known ground. We will use the large copper fills to connect the SSD to an adapter board in this case. After performing this test, we determined that the following pin was ground. Now we need to determine what logic levels are in use; remember that the Pi uses a 3.3V logic level by default, so if there are other levels in use, we will need to locate a reference voltage for the level shifter. We will use the following pinout of the SSD for reference: After measuring the voltages on the connector, we saw the following voltages. Side Note: When reversing a new target, I like to place the target platform on top of a blank sheet of paper; that way, I can quickly write down notes as I am probing/reverse engineering without having to turn away from the workspace. You can see this in the video below: Pin Voltage Usage 1 0V GND 2 3.28V ??? 3 3.28V ??? 4 3.173V ??? 5 0.02V ??? 6 3.284V ??? 7 3.284V ??? 8 3.284V ??? It is extremely common for voltage sources to have capacitors connected to them called decoupling capacitors. These capacitors help stabilize the power supply in the event of voltage fluctuations. From here, there are two approaches that we can take to finding out which pins might be VCC on our SSD. Note what pins are connected to large capacitors near the connector Monitor the voltage source on power up / power down Based on the voltages we collected, we should monitor pins 2,3,4,6,7, and \\8 with the oscilloscope and see how they differ. Take a look at the images below and see if you can spot the different one: If we examine the images highlighted in green below, we see a relatively sharp drop from high to low: Looking closely at the images above, you may notice that image 1 has a slightly different shape when it rises and falls than the other lines. This is likely due to a capacitor being present somewhere on this line, which makes it a good candidate for VCC. This was pin two on the debug header, so we can now update our table as shown below. Pin Voltage Usage 1 0V GND 2 3.28V VCC 3 3.28V ??? 4 3.173V ??? 5 0.02V ??? 6 3.284V ??? 7 3.284V ??? 8 3.284V ??? We will connect to the SSD using the clips shown in the image below, these were also purchased on AliExpress. With this assumption, we are left with six unknown pins. Next, we can perform a JTAG IDCODE scan using the go-jtagenum tools; this will attempt to brute force all of the possible JTAG pin combinations and will report back pin configurations that report a valid ID code or pass the bypass test. If you’re unfamiliar with these scans and want to learn more about them, check out my old writeup here. pi@voidstar:~/go/bin/linux_arm $ ./go-jtagenum -pins '{ \"pin2\": 2, \"pin3\": 3, \"pin14\": 14, \"pin15\": 15, \"pin10\": 10, \"pin9\": 9}' -command scan_idcode -delay-tck 50 defined pins: map[2:pin2 3:pin3 9:pin9 10:pin10 14:pin14 15:pin15] ================================ Starting scan for IDCODE...

You’ll notice that go-jtagenum discovered what it believes to be multiple possible pin mappings, some of which contain more “devices” than others. While it is possible that there can be various devices on a JTAG scan chain, we know that this device is pretty straightforward and will not likely have 10+ devices. This is the one drawback of the IDCODE scan; it simply checks to see if data is changing** on the assumed TDO port, which can lead to many false positives. However, the entry displaying just one IDCODE value looks promising; we can further investigate this TAP using the BYPASS scan. We can attempt to verify these results with a bypass scan. The BYPASS scan attempts to leverage the BYPASS instruction of the JTAG TAP which directly links the TDI and TDO lines. The scan attempts to enter the BYPASS instruction, provides a unique bit pattern on TDI, and monitors for that same pattern on TDO. If the data sent on TDI matches what is read on TDO, then the scan has determined the correct pinout. The results of the BYPASS scan can be seen below: ['defined pins: map[2:IO_2 3:IO_3 9:IO_9 10:IO_10 14:IO_14 15:IO_]', '================================', 'Starting scan for pattern 0110011101001101101000010111001001', 'active, TCK:IO_10 TMS:IO_14 TDO:IO_ TDI:IO_2, wrong data received (0000000000000000000000000000000000)', ' try adjusting frequency, delays, pullup, check hardware connectivity', 'FOUND!

So now that we know what the pins are, we need to use them to access the test access port (TAP) on the device. There is only one problem: we know our pins, but now we need to figure out how to actually use them. We can now write to the Instruction Register (IR) and Data Registers (DR), but without knowing what to write to them, knowing the JTAG pinout is largely useless. Before we move forward, we need to figure out two things: What type of CPU is this? Can we use any open-source tools to interact with it? To determine what type of CPU we’re dealing with, we can start with the ID. We can extract this via a tool called UrJTAG. UrJTAG for Reverse Engineers UrJTAG is an open-source tool designed for performing low-level JTAG operations. This tool allows one to programmatically read and write the instruction register and corresponding data registers when connected to a JTAG TAP. It was originally designed to enable developers to use other JTAG tooling besides those provided by the original component manufacturer. Because of this tool’s low-level instrumentation and introspection, it is also beneficial to us as reverse engineers when examining a new TAP. pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/urjtag-2021.03 $ sudo ./src/apps/jtag/jtag UrJTAG 2021.03 # Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 ETC s.r.o.

After defining our cable, we can run the detect, idcode, and discover commands, which will attempt to learn more about the TAP that it is connected to, resulting in the output above. After running a UrJTAG scan, we now know the following: How many available DRs are present The width of all of the available DRs Confirmation of the CPU ID Confirmation of the JTAG pinout This is a lot of great information that we did not have at the beginning of this post, but what can we do with it? In order to read memory, set breakpoints, etc., we need to know more about how to interact with these registers. Without a datasheet, this is a difficult task. However, there are other open-source tools that we can leverage before attempting black box reverse engineering of the JTAG TAP. OpenOCD for Reverse Engineers Armed with this information, we can search the ID and determine that this chip uses the ARCompact architecture, and if we check the configuration files for OpenOCD, we can see this ID code in the following files: pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl/cpu/arc $ ls common.tcl em.tcl hs.tcl v2.tcl Let’s see what CPUs reference these files, this will give us a better understanding of how to write a generic OpenOCD config file for an ARCompact target. pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl $ grep -r \"arc/common\" * cpu/arc/v2.tcl:source [find cpu/arc/common.tcl] pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl $ grep -r \"arc/v2\" * cpu/arc/em.tcl:source [find cpu/arc/v2.tcl] cpu/arc/hs.tcl:source [find cpu/arc/v2.tcl] pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl $ grep -r \"arc/hs\" * target/snps_hsdk.cfg:source [find cpu/arc/hs.tcl] target/snps_hsdk_4xd.cfg:source [find cpu/arc/hs.tcl] pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl $ grep -r \"arc/em\" * target/snps_em_sk_fpga.cfg:source [find cpu/arc/em.tcl] pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl $ It looks like there is a few target file that uses these config files: snps_hsdk snps_hsdk_4xd snps_em_sk_fpga Let’s do one more quick search before trying to write our own config file; if we search for the above config files, we find the following: pi@voidstar:~/pifex/software/openocd/tcl/board $ ls -lathr *snps* -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 411 May 4 18:20 snps_hsdk_4xd.cfg -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 416 May 4 18:20 snps_hsdk.cfg -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 615 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk_v2.2.cfg -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 659 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk_v2.1.cfg -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 555 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk_v1.cfg -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 612 May 4 18:20 snps_em_sk.cfg All of these config files are very straightforward and essentially import one of the three files located in the target folder. Taking some basic information from the target folder we will construct our own OpenOCD as shown below: source [find cpu/arc/hs.tcl] transport select jtag # We don't know much about this CPU at the moment, until we do we'll assume that # it has one core that we will index at 0 and that the dbg set _coreid 0 set _dbgbase 0 # CHIPNAME will be used to choose core family (600, 700 or EM).

It looks like we have connected to the JTAG TAP of this SSD using OpenOCD. Next, we will use this to read memory and single-step through the running firmware on the SSD itself. Reading Memory with OpenOCD Now that we have a working OpenOCD connection, we can read memory using the mdw and dump_image commands.

This creates an interesting problem: we don’t know what the memory contents will look like at address 0, especially since we don’t have a datasheet or an example firmware image. In this case, we will start by running strings on the resulting binary; some of these results can be seen below: pi@voidstar:~/pifex/ssd-example $ strings mem-test.binless 02023042MS2295CAX--XYYYYYYYY SM2259PARA SM2259BT xSM2259BTDS SM2259AC20200324 L^r| %`)$5a94 SMISSDRetryTable Device_FW_Authentication xFW_MAC_Key SM2259ROMCodeTagZZZZ We’ve got human-readable strings, which is a great sign! We also have the part number for the CPU in these strings, which leads me to believe we’ve correctly extracted this memory region via OpenOCD. However, we need to learn more about this processor and what areas might interest us. We can figure this out using OpenOCD to attach to the target CPU via GDB. Debugging with OpenOCD Now that we have OpenOCD connected to our target, we can attempt to debug the target via GDB. However, this does not come without some strings attached; we will need to compile a version of GDB capable of targeting the ARCompact architecture. Luckily for us, the good folks over at Synopsis have released a port of binutils for the ARCompact architecture. We can clone the repository here and build it on the Raspberry Pi (Note: see the appendix for instructions on how to build this software). After building GDB and attempting to connect to the GDB server presented by OpenOCD, we see the following: (gdb) x/10i $pc => 0x22b0: brne_s r0,0,10 ;0x22ba 0x22b2: ldb.di r2,[r18,3] 0x22b6: btst_s r2,0x7 0x22b8: beq_s -282 ;0x219e 0x22ba: ldb r4,[0x852] 0x22c2: bbit0.t r4,0,18 ;0x22d2 0x22c6: ldb.di r2,[r13,113] 0x22ca: bset_s r2,r2,0 0x22cc: stb.di r2,[r13,113] 0x22d0: b_s 12 ;0x22dc (gdb) i r r0 0x0 0 r1 0x101 257 r2 0x10004aac 268454572 r3 0x0 0 r4 0x100014b6 268440758 r5 0x50100000 1343225856 r6 0x50100000 1343225856 r7 0x10 16 r8 0x0 0 r9 0x0 0 r10 0x0 0 r11 0x4 4 r12 0x0 0 r13 0x50000000 1342177280 r14 0x0 0 r15 0x0 0 r16 0x5000a000 1342218240 Success! Using OpenOCD and GDB, we are able to single-step through the firmware and read register values. These register values tell us more about potential memory regions of interest that we can read out, specifically 0x50000000 and 0x10000000. As a final test, we will load the area of memory we extracted initially into Ghidra and see if the instructions match what we see in GDB. Loading the Firmware into Ghidra While the current Ghidra release does not support ARCompact, a wonderful fork is being maintained here. We can build this and use it to analyze our firmware image. If we look at offset 0 in the firmware image, we have what appears to be an interrupt vector table of some sort: If we look a little further at the image, we can see that there are some branch instructions for a region that we’ve not extracted yet. We also see that the two areas we previously identified (0x50000000 and 0x10000000) are being referenced as well. These are likely internal/external SRAM regions, while the area starting around 0x4007000 appears to be used as code. Let’s try to extract that region, load it into our Ghidra database, and see if the results make sense. First, we’ll dump the region out using OpenOCD, as shown below: dump_image 0x40070000.bin 0x40070000 0x100000 We can then import it into our Ghidra database, resulting in the following: Success: It looks like we have code in this region, and it disassembles properly. From here, we now have the following primitives available to us on the SSD: Memory R/W Control Flow Monitoring / Modifications Register Reads/Writes This puts one in a perfect position to do more software research, look for bugs or errors in their code, or even attempt to modify the firmware or reverse engineer the update process! Conclusion If you’ve read this far, thank you for taking the time to read it all. This probably should have been two separate posts! With this blog post, we introduced the PiFex hardware and software tools. These tools utilize open-source software and commercial hardware to aid in embedded device assessments. We then demonstrated how to use these tools to discover and enumerate an undocumented JTAG TAP on an SSD. Using this TAP, we were able to read memory and control execution on the target, giving us full control over the device.

It's not at all hard to blow the JTAG enable fuse in most chips. And you can give away a ton of info from your device if you don't do this. That potentially includes really sensitive info - through backdoors like this. People keep all kinds of stuff on their hard drives. (Full disclosure: I'm the HW eng who reviewed this design. Hi Matt! Reverse engineering is still magic.) reply londons_explore 18 hours agoparentI don't disable JTAG on field hardware because theres a good chance I'll be expected to do failure analysis or bug-hunting on the production hardware. JTAG is going to make that much easier. And, lets be honest, your smart IoT coffee maker doesn't really have any secrets that need protecting from you, despite whatever the business team thinks. reply foldor 18 hours agorootparentHard disagree. That \"smart IoT coffee maker\" stores your wifi details, including the password so it can reconnect. I appreciate the level of sophistication and effort required for someone to be able to abuse that is beyond the realm of likelihood, it's not unreasonable to believe that there may be higher value targets (like journalists) who are being targeted where this is a reasonable method for dedicated attackers to use to gain access to a targets home network. Better to just secure these things by default. reply crispyambulance 17 hours agorootparentIt really depends on the situation. For a mature, mass-produced product going into sensitive places, sure, disable it before it goes into the field. Same for very security-focused hardware. But most of the \"pizza-box-shaped\" things I've worked on in telecom have jtag enabled even when in the field. I've never thought about it much, but to actually get to a jtag interface requires a level of physical access that would be far-fetched unless you're talking about \"James-Bond-level\" bad actors or \"inside-job\" people who are already entrusted with an enormous amount of privileges anyway. JTAG is super useful for troubleshooting and in general, for things that aren't throw aways and that can be repaired, re-calibrated, or re-configured, it makes sense to keep it available. reply londons_explore 16 hours agorootparentprevIf your attack vector is bad guys with physical access to the circuit board, disabling JTAG will only be a minor speedbump to them. The vast majority of microcontrollers aren't hardened against physical attack - especially not anything with wifi capability. \"disable jtag\" is intended to make it harder to make modchips (ie. bypass the coffee subscription), but doesn't help against someone willing to do a one-off glitching attack or similar to dump secrets. reply OJFord 18 hours agorootparentprevYou're worried about someone with physical access and time to dump info from a JTAG header gaining the WiFi password? reply y04nn 9 hours agorootparentA plausible scenario I can think of would be in an office space, a shared smart coffee machine that would be stolen to gain WIFI access. reply theamk 7 hours agorootparentSurely the shared coffee machine would be on a guest network with no access to internal resources?

Coffee maker type devices are likely to be just a $1 a microcontroller with inbuilt flash which you can fuse when programming to prevent reading but is rarely done in small production runs. flash for microcontrollers such as ESP, Rpi pico etc is usually saved on an 8-pin flash chip which most people forget about and is easy to unsolder and pop into a reader. bigger devices using bootloaders sometimes store a whole FAT32 filesystem in one of these, you can even unsolder most flash and re-mount it with a little skill and suitable hardware. I once read an AWS private key stored in plain text from an IOT board once. Go figure! reply numpad0 14 hours agorootparentprevOne of items often missing from discussions on security on the Internet is that the first step of security is physical security. Phrases like \"once they have it it's over\", \"DRM is not security\" are not just mantras, it's reflecting that. To secure a thing, you are supposed to literally secure the thing, as in, placing the equipment away from walls, bolted down to the floor, chassis locked and rigged for self destruction, perimeters patrolled and monitored by armed guards. Software security is additional parts that build on top of that physical security. Hardware root of trust, Secure Boot, code signing, all helps, but physical security has to come first. If you're throwing out the coffee maker not securely erased(military guys call it zeroizing - cool), or not maintaining custody of it by either keeping it to yourself or having dogs and your grandsons taking part watching it at all times, then the coffee maker is technically not secure, by any of those alone. reply ronsor 4 hours agorootparentprevIf your concern is attackers breaking into your home, opening your coffee maker, and dumping credentials over JTAG, I think your threat model might need serious revisions. reply ProllyInfamous 18 hours agorootparentprevJust out of curiosity, what coffee-making function would possess somebody enough to connect their coffeemaker to the internet?

My local electric utility has a smart grid, but offers me as a consumer none of the so-far-listed reasons to connect to WiFi for electricity savings (e.g. no time of use metering)... but it would be cool if the anode deterioration could be monitored [I'll check the manual]. reply Larrikin 10 hours agorootparentprevThere is an entire operating system and a massive amount of functionality in your home that can be unlocked when devices have features like that. It's one of most active projects on GitHub and there's a huge community that knows the value. The only downside is companies trying to scoop up that data for their own purposes and when companies disable perfectly working products because they claim the servers are too expensive. The Home Assistant community makes a big point of recommending products that guard against issues like that. https://www.home-assistant.io/ reply margalabargala 17 hours agorootparentprevAdding to the other reasons listed here: Some people have solar installations, but do not have 1-to-1 net metering from their power company. For these people, having a connected hot water heater allows them to use their own solar power for heating water when they can, lowering their power bill. Essentially any high-consumption electrical device can similarly benefit, especially ones that store energy such as hot water heaters and electric car chargers. reply beeboobaa3 15 hours agorootparentprevYikes. You think people shouldn't be allowed to know their own wifi credentials?

Why do you need physical access? reply londons_explore 17 hours agorootparentMost embedded hardware has no easy way to send/restore core dumps if JTAG is disabled. And even if it did, a good chunk of debugging involves running the system live in the target environment and looking at traces.

    "commentBody": "Stack Overflow and OpenAI are partnering (stackoverflow.co)181 points by onatm 20 hours agohidepastfavorite173 comments foundart 18 hours agoOn SO I can spend time digging through the questions the search index thinks are related, reading through the answers and the comments on the answers. If I'm lucky I find what I need. If not I then need to spend another bunch of time trying to formulate a question in a way that won't get down voted or marked as a duplicate. Then I need to wait for an answer. Or I can spend a much shorter amount of time formulating a question for Chat-GPT and generally get a helpful, focused answer without any pedantic digressions. It seems likely that the AI benefits from the information in SO. If Open AI can help improve the SO experience that would be fantastic. reply luis02lopez 17 hours agoparentYeah, the problem is that you are relying on free contributors, these free contributors will get discouraged if your ideas can just be stolen by ChatGPT as their idea for a solution. reply hbn 13 hours agorootparentMost SO answers are clarifying a niche implementation detail or gotcha of a programming language, troubleshooting someone's build configuration, etc. If an LLM trained on that info and later helped someone solve their problem by spitting out an answer, I don't see who was discouraged, nor do I think any \"ideas\" were \"stolen.\" You don't go to SO to crowdsource creative ideas. It's for very specific one-off questions that many people will likely find themselves asking at some point. reply bn-l 17 hours agorootparentprevAlso, people rely on the feedback to show how helpful their contributions are. The SO economy relies on \"karma\". If you silo off the view from the production you get a situation where producers are no longer incentivized. reply cloverich 14 hours agorootparentHere is one easy way to solve this problem based on my current workflow: ChatGPT recognizes the novel pseudo addition you arrive at in your coding and prompts you to review the Q&A summary it creates and posts on your behalf. I would happily do this. reply foundart 16 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, and I believe SO and OpenAI must realize this also. It's in everyone's best interest to keep the contributions coming. I certainly hope they can figure out a way to achieve that. reply gameshot911 16 hours agorootparentprevEh, I think people's motivations for responding on forums like SO are other than whether ChatGPT will incorporate their information or not. reply gkoberger 18 hours agoprevThis was so vague that my take is a bit different than everyone else's here – my guess is that developers love StackOverflow, hate that OpenAI is stealing their info and destroying SO, and OpenAI sees this as a cheap way to curry favor with developers (and based on the response here, it's not working). I think both SO and OpenAI see the writing on the wall (unfortunately). The real \"partnership\" is OpenAI gets to say \"look, we're working together!\" to avoid accusations of destroying SO, and SO gets to save a little bit of face (and hopefully make a little money) on the way down. reply julianeon 16 hours agoparentI wouldn't say StackOverflow is especially beloved by developers. Coders on X/Twitter used to complain about how much they dislike SO all the time; I see less of those now, probably because they've switched to using ChatGPT. When I've seen blog posts or headlines about them in the past 1-2 years, they're usually about how \"StackOverflow is dying.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1592s82/the_fa... reply politelemon 14 hours agorootparentIt's worth keeping in mind that there are a certain kind of people that inhabit twitter and we aren't exactly the appreciative kind, nor are we representative of a presumed developer monolith which doesn't exist. reply gkoberger 15 hours agorootparentprevObviously tech isn't a monoculture and everyone has their own unique opinions, however... I think it boils down to more of \"Hey, we can criticize StackOverflow since we're on the inside... but if someone attacks from the outside, we have its back.\" reply Foobar8568 4 hours agorootparentprevSO is mainly used and loved by entreprise developers not hanging out on Twitter, HN etc. reply indigodaddy 19 hours agoprevOh boy there’s plenty of incorrect information on SO, even occasionally fully upvoted “official” answers reply erksa 19 hours agoparentMakes me think of the tweet: > Docker for Windows won't run if you have the Razer Synapse driver management tool running. https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1229641258370355200 :) Edit: The reason was that both software directly copied something from stackoverflow. reply gregmac 17 hours agoparentprevAnd an equal amount of \"was correct in 2009 when the answer was accepted but is no longer [the optimal answercorrect at all]\". There's usually another answer that's current+correct, often with 1/10th the votes. Any question posted in the past half-decade has been immediately closed as \"duplicate\", even if it points out the other question is no longer working. 5 moderators agreed with the close so they must be right. This already has meant SO dropped out of relevance for anything that's long-lived but evolving. I assume it still works for brand-new stuff where there are no apparent duplicates. It works for unchanging old stuff (and the absolute basics of programming), because the old answers are still relevant. But take anything like Java, C#, Python, or Javascript that have evolved radically since SO's inception and the answers are often garbage. IMHO, SO needs to solve this to not die... if it isn't already too late. I can't tell from the article, but a logical use of AI on SO would be to answer questions, tailored to each user, just like people do with ChatGPT etc today. However this means there's now no new questions even feeding in, let alone new/updated answers. So the training data for the AI becomes increasingly out-of-date/wrong. I don't see how this solves the existential problem SO has, but maybe it will delay their demise a bit. reply johnfernow 18 hours agoparentprevThere's also information that technically works but is horrendously insecure that is highly upvoted on SO. There's usually people in the comments noting how insecure it is, but I wish there was some moderator action that could cause for an answer to be marked as insecure, as I'm sure there are people who have copied the unsafe solutions without looking at the comments. There are also answers that \"work\" and aren't insecure but will near certainly cause other issues. I'm sure some people upvote because they had the same question, tried the solution, and it seemingly worked (even if it's not secure, performant, etc.), so they upvote. But you'd think they'd at least check the comments and see what people are saying before trying (let alone upvoting) a solution. reply itherseed 14 hours agoparentprev> there’s plenty of incorrect information on SO Even worse is the outdated information reply throwthrowuknow 14 hours agorootparentWhich is somehow always the top search result reply bilekas 18 hours agoprevWhile it makes sense for SO to do this, I can't help but feel uneasy about the consolidation of all these resources. Microsoft, `Open`AI, Github, LinkedIn, Stackoverflow .. Feels like it will end badly. reply blantonl 18 hours agoparentConsolidation of information resources is a feature of AI models. A model trained on commits, a resume and past experience, along with answers to technical questions. That's a feature of an AI model reply DaiPlusPlus 18 hours agoparentprevIt can be argued that having a nice big consolidated target makes it easier to regulate, though. reply bilekas 18 hours agorootparentMaybe, and I hope so, but the cynic in me feels it would act as a higher incentive to invest far more into lobbying against any meaningful regulation. reply LeifCarrotson 17 hours agorootparentA single giant organization, or a single-digit number of megacorps in the space, will have lobbyists who are on a first-name basis with every member of the appropriate congressional committees and relevant executive agencies. reply indymike 17 hours agorootparentprevRegulation and innovation rarely make good business partners. reply syndicatedjelly 18 hours agorootparentprevWhy is “easy to regulate “ a good thing? reply DaiPlusPlus 18 hours agorootparentI come from a background of high-trust societies where regulation serves the public good; whereas distrust of \"big government\" hurts everyone. To quote Francis Fukuyama: \"Widespread distrust in a society, in other words, imposes a kind of tax on all forms of economic activity, a tax that high-trust societies do not have to pay.\". reply mrd3v0 18 hours agorootparentI understand, and even agree with the notion that deep societal distrust is unhealthy and problematic, however, that doesn't necessarily answer the question of needing that trust in the first place [to regulate]. Having a company with that much power is in fact harder to regulate, which in turn means we are going to have to trust the public institutions even more to do their jobs. I don't see why we should put ourselves in a position where we need that kind of trust. Another way to put it is, why burden the government with an unsustainable uncompetitive market? For what? OpenAI is a for-profit private corporation with a commercial service to offer that has no bearing on the most important concerns the government is elected each year to tackle. reply bilekas 18 hours agorootparent>I don't see why we should put ourselves in a position where we need that kind of trust. Another way to put it is, why burden the government with an unsustainable uncompetitive market? For what? I'm not sure I follow this exactly, isn't regulation supposed to aid in preventing an `unsustainable uncompetitive market` ? The market has shown over and over that left to it's own devices, things will not balance out. reply DaiPlusPlus 18 hours agorootparentprev> Another way to put it is, why burden the government with an unsustainable uncompetitive market? For what? Because the societal costs of certain industries' unregulated activities do more harm than the economic cost of doing that regulation. Despite what the Libertarian Party's pamphlet might say, regulation is invariably reactive rather than proactive; the saying is \"safety-codes are written in blood\", after-all. Note that I'm not advocating we \"regulate AI\" now; instead I believe we're still in the \"wait-and-see\" phase (whereas we're definitely past that for social-media services like Facebook, but that's another story). There are hypothetical, but plausible, risks; but in the event they become real then we (society) need to be prepared to respond appropriately. I'm not an expert in this area; I don't need to be: I trust people who do know better than me to come up with workable proposals. How about that? reply datameta 17 hours agorootparentIf you'll excuse my departure from what is normal lexicon for this site, I believe that without pre-emptive regulation on AI technology advancement and mergers the \"wait and see\" phase quickly becomes a \"fuck around and find out\" phrase. Regulatory bodies have long been behind on understanding of technology, for example for the first few decades of world wide web advancements (and I would argue even now). I don't think we can afford a reactionary lag time with a technology capable of so profoundly transforming our societies. I hope we can nudge the developments in a positive direction before there is an all-out AI arms race. I understand the nuances in balancing regulating your own country's AI efforts with making sure you are not outstripped. Perhaps we need something akin to the international treaties dedicated to avoid a colonization dash of outer space. reply spywaregorilla 17 hours agorootparentfuck around and find out is about testing the limits on someone's patience / threats / bluffs. reply datameta 12 hours agorootparentI'm well aware of the common usage - try to turn your perception to see how it applies here in the abstract sense. The ones who believe no regulation is necessary will be delivered the finding out through brilliantly and hilariously malicious agents. reply oceanplexian 17 hours agorootparentprev> I come from a background of high-trust societies You mentioned the concept of 'high trust societies'. Assuming you are referring to one or the other, how long ago did Western European, or East Asian countries transition from authoritarian, anti-democratic regimes to being regarded as high trust societies? In my opinion, it seems that many of these high trust societies were the exact opposite within living memory. Which would make me even more skeptical and cautious, not more trusting. The US might get flak for our system, but it has been around and survived world wars, civil wars, etc. Our inherent distrust of \"big government\" has a track record of preserving a functional democracy longer than any other system. And the outcome has been a highly competitive and successful economy that hasn't been replicated elsewhere. reply DaiPlusPlus 16 hours agorootparentCanada and Australia too. Curb your American exceptionalism. And arguably, wouldn’t it have been better if no civil-war happened in the first place? reply NicoJuicy 17 hours agorootparentprevI think most of that can be attributed based on the land locked neighbors, no state actors neighboring the US have malicious intent ( eg. Russia, China, Iran, ...) reply mthoms 14 hours agorootparentprevThere's a lot of truth to that, but success can be measured in different ways. Other democratic, capitalist-leaning countries have much less economic inequality. To them, that's a feature, not a bug. The US economy of today is nothing like the US economy of the 50's and 60's where working class people could own homes, had stable jobs and could afford healthcare. To treat it like the same consistent \"system\" throughout the past is missing a lot of nuance. The way economic inequality is trending today, this will all end very badly IMHO. Edit: By total coincidence, this relevant TED talk is now on the second page of HN - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40278189 reply shrimp_emoji 17 hours agorootparentprevThat tax is literally crypto's compute demands. Making a trustless system is a lot of work (and hopefully it's not necessary). reply rmorey 17 hours agoparentprevAn acquisition, yes that would be concerning. A partnership, however, I can get behind reply petetnt 19 hours agoprevI wonder if I will get residuals from answers, where do I insert my bank account number reply coldpie 19 hours agoparentSorry, the big companies decided copyright infringement is OK if they do literally all of it at once.

For Python it would actually be very easy with backends such as Google Colab or even built-in ChatGPT Code Interpreter. reply shombaboor 18 hours agoprevI go to chatgpt for boilerplate library stuff, but S/O had actual people responding.

But to precise, user had already second-highest score long prior to period of posting AI work. In that case AI answers did not affect ranking. reply Atotalnoob 18 hours agoparentprevSeems odd to post 1850 answers then all of a sudden regret it.

I realize they're already part of the dataset, but my goal is to hurt Stack Overflow (ever so slightly) for this decision. reply nolongerthere 17 hours agorootparentI wish you wouldn't do that, you end up hurting regular developers more. reply beeboobaa3 16 hours agorootparentI wish Stack Overflow didn't sell out to OpenAI, but it is what it is. reply 93po 13 hours agorootparenti wish stack overflow spent any of the past decade+ as the leader in this area to innovate and make their platform at all better than it is now. i hate the experience of googling and finding a SO answer, chatGPT is a massively better experience reply mg 18 hours agoprevWhat would be a typical coding question which AI would not be able to answer in the near future without having access to Stack Overflow? I find it hard to imagine that AI will need humans to teach it technologies like programming languages and APIs for long. We don't need humans to teach computers how to play chess anymore. reply jacooper 18 hours agoparentI think humans will move much higher in the development model, devs are going to become essentially Product managers for their projects. AI can't plan well, but if you just give it a simple request it will do it, however it won't plan an entire app for you, at least not very well. reply nicklecompte 18 hours agoprevThe thing that makes me so sad about this: when I steal an answer from StackOverflow I always put a comment linking to where I got the answer. I could pretend that I do this because it's a good software maintenance practice. Truthfully, I only do it because it's the right thing to do. It's about professionalism and integrity. Laundering human responses via a large language model not only makes it impossible to acknowledge SO contributors: it encourages people to think GPT figured these things out solely because it's simply so darn clever. It doesn't help that SO's marketing is encouraging developers to not care about integrity or professionalism: > provide OpenAI users and customers with the accurate and vetted data foundation that AI tools need to quickly find a solution to a problem so that technologists can stay focused on priority tasks.

They did at one point turn off the data dumps, early in the AI in fact and likely because they wanted to sell the data. But they were reinstated after massive backlash [3]. They could do this again and make future content exclusive. But haven’t done so yet, and if they do, it will be very public. [1] https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/344491/an-update-on....

OpenAI took everything they needed, nowadays most answers are probably generated by OpenAI anyway. reply dylan604 19 hours agoparentThis seems like one of those better to ask for forgiveness than permission issues getting resolved. SO knew their value was already taken for free. They also know there is absolutely nothing they can do since the models have already been trained. The only thing left to do to salvage any value was to make a press release blessing the theft so they don't look silly going forward. reply beeboobaa3 19 hours agorootparentNothing has been resolved. OpenAI still infringed on copyright and should still be punished for this. They broke the law on a grand scale, used this to make shitloads of money, and are now trying to use that money to pay off anyone that might give them trouble. Classic mob mentality. reply dylan604 18 hours agorootparentSO has to make a decision of how much can they prove in court. If they can prove it, what kind of damages might they be awarded, and if any rewards would cover the the expense of bringing the case forward. If any of those questions are a \"no\", then you have to try to save face some how. This is that face saving move. So to me, it sounds like they decided \"no\" was an answer somewhere in the decision tree. When you steal, steal big. You go to jail for stealing someone's things, but if you steal everyone's things, then it's just too much for people to handle and they'd rather the whole thing just goes away really.

It doesn't indicate that generative AI is going to be shoehorned into StackOverflow's websites. It would seem counterproductive, in fact, to do that, since the gist of this seems to be that StackOverflow provides a large wealth of organized, validated human-generated knowledge, which is exactly the sort of thing you want to train LLMs on. Feeding AI-generated data back into that would diminish the value of the data SO hosts for that purpose. reply KeplerBoy 19 hours agorootparentToo bad OpenAI already scrapped all of this data years ago and is in a position of power here. reply Gormo 19 hours agorootparentNot sure what you mean. Sure, they've scraped a lot of data, but websites are in a position to inhibit further scraping, so it's in their interests to cooperate with data sources they want to rely on. I'm not sure what \"position of power\" you could be referring to. Power to do what, with respect to what? OpenAI has useful tools that Stack Overflow wants to apply to its own use cases, and Stack Overflow has good data for training LLMs on. Seems like a straightforward alignment of incentives. reply KeplerBoy 19 hours agorootparentOpenAI has enough motivation to circumvent whatever anti-scraping measures stackoverflow could muster. I assume stackoverflow's metrics (traffic, number of new questions and answers) are down by an amount they are not happy with, so they are eager to strike any deal before their ship sinks. At least that's how I read the news piece. Personally, I'm as often on stackoverflow, as I've ever been, whereas my chatGPT usage is down to almost zero. reply Gormo 18 hours agorootparent> OpenAI has enough motivation to circumvent whatever anti-scraping measures stackoverflow could muster. And even greater motivation to just cooperate with StackOverflow for mutual benefit, rather than engage in a ridiculous arms race with them. > I assume stackoverflow's metrics (traffic, number of new questions and answers) are down by an amount they are not happy with, so they are eager to strike any deal before their ship sinks. I'm not sure I'd understand the connection to this even if that were true. The value StackOverflow seems to be bringing to the table is specifically a large dataset of human-curated technical knowledge. Both parties in this arrangement would have strong interest in ensuring that StackOverflow continues to generate this data through its user-centric Q&A website. I'm not sure how a deal with OpenAI would prevent their \"ship\" from \"sinking\" if that were the situation they were in. > Personally, I'm as often on stackoverflow, as I've ever been, whereas my chatGPT usage is down to almost zero. Same here. ChatGPT is a nice novelty, but I haven't found all that much productive use for it. Most people I know who do use it regularly are using it for either correcting their spelling/grammar, or as a conversational-interface search engine, neither of which I find to be superior to proofreading my own writing or evaluating information from its original sources after doing a conventional search. But there might be a value-add for StackOverflow in the latter case: finding specific answers to complex questions can be a hit-or-miss proposition, and ChatGPT might at least provide a more efficient way of finding the articles that answer your questions, if implemented properly. Of course, implementing it properly would likely involve designing the LLM to track the sources of the data it's tokenizing, and present a 'bibliography' for each of its answers, rather than just blindly compositing data from all sources into single probability values. reply fire_lake 19 hours agorootparentprevStackOverflow released a data bundle that anyone could use to prevent scraping. reply jononor 19 hours agorootparentprevI hope that StackOverflow people understand this.

I specialize in Amazon Redshift. I've written a lot of PDFs about Amazon Redshift - serious stuff, deep technical investigations and explanations, published along with the source code which produces the evidence which the PDF is based on - and when people asked questions where I'd written up the answer, I pointed them at the appropriate PDF. After some months, I received a direct message, which looked to me to be a pro-forma, a standard message sent in this situation, from the staff that I was promoting my site and I should not do so. It was well written and polite. That's fine - I have no problems with that, it's their web-site. What I did not like, however, and what came over as slimey, was that the staff had also deleted every post I had made. This was not mentioned, at all, in the well written and polite message, which then of course became disingenuous. If you're going to do something serious like that, you need to tell people, not let them discover it for themselves. This was for all posts, where I'd explained something directly or pointed to a PDF - presumably it's a standard action SO take in this situation. I deleted my account and left. reply shawn_w 17 hours agorootparentprevSO corporate has been trying to shoehorn AI into the sites ever since it became the latest buzzword.

It feels like it's a whole lot of nothing to me, and exchange they're letting OpenAI having all of their Q/A data. I doubt it will make any significant difference to S/O for most people; and anyone who thinks putting S/O links in a chatGPT response is going to drive traffic back to S/O is kiddddddddddding themselves. reply matt_s 18 hours agoparentprevI feel like they are already very similar in the sense that any answers you read should be assumed as being wrong first and let them prove they are correct before putting something in your code. reply rocgf 19 hours agoparentprevConversely, if you don't want to use OpenAI and/or SO, you are free to do so.

It’s because every time I ask a question, it gets closed as a duplicate by people who clearly haven’t read my question carefully. It’s exhausting and not really worth the effort to fight for it to be reopened. reply zadokshi 18 hours agorootparentYep, knowing this problem well, I asked a question the other day and defensively linked to the other similar questions to explain why they were not duplicates. My question was still closed with the claim of it being a duplicate. Last time I’ll ever bother trying to use SO again. The decision to close my question in spite of it having a clear technical difference made no sense at all. It honestly felt like a bot that just noticed that a lot of the content of the question was related to other questions-a bot without the ability to understand why the question is literally different. Why is SO like this these days. Is it just because there is such a large history of content in the site, that it’s easy for people who don’t want to think to just mark questions closed? reply fire_lake 18 hours agorootparentSometimes questions get answered despite them being closed. These are often the most useful! reply code_runner 19 hours agorootparentprevOver zealous moderation and the average age of a question/answer being like 8 years. There are very few novel questions and the ones that are there use outdated apis. reply Levitz 18 hours agorootparentprevI've come to use ChatGPT instead. The reason is that while using SO you generally reach similar errors and then read answers and try to make sense out of the problem you are having, that's fantastic, but being able to explicitly state your problem and make followup questions on it is even better. Yesterday I had to engage with a project using Redux. It has been a while since I touched that technology so I went forward and gave a summary of it to ChatGPT asking if I was correct on my assumptions, from there onwards I made a couple more explanations, a couple questions and I was done. I think this ability to further prod with questions is too good of a feature to pass on. reply airstrike 19 hours agorootparentprevmoderation there is done so poorly it continues to discourage users from participating while not really slowing down entropy as the site ages and the number of posts grow moderation there is done so poorly it has become a meme of sorts, so even if and when it improves, any improvement in perception will lag... and because users choose to use the site based on their perception of its value rather than its true value, it has sort of become a vicious cycle reply moralestapia 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's full of assholes now and people generally prefer not to be around those. reply amarcheschi 18 hours agorootparentprevMay I ask what you use instead? reply mhitza 18 hours agorootparentDocumentation, GitHub issues, language forums, reddit.

Wealth will concentrate significantly towards the winners, while the losers will be out of work with a valueless skillset, and their basic needs going unmet. While this may be true for most high-skill professions in the coming decades, there's a unique irony for programmers - who will be the losers, having invented and then fueled the engine of their own demise on behalf of the winners.

It's called fake jobs. Programming has already mostly automated itself out of existence for a long time. Very few developers ever get the opportunity to write data structures and algorithms, because most of what they do is just slapping together glue code for existing libraries at cushy sinecures at places like Google, where PhDs are paid to write HTML and play air hockey. If the machine can write the HTML and glue too, then there won't be much left over about the job aside from the ideology and politics.

And it's unlikely that customers will stop having (and creating new) problems. \"No job\" is only a problem for someone who refuses to learn and move on.

PC that somehow got sold. reply neilv 6 hours agorootparentIIRC, there was a non-publicly-known switch to turn off IME, for government purposes, which became publicly-known. There have also been efforts to delete just part of IME from the flash. A couple links: https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner https://doc.coreboot.org/northbridge/intel/sandybridge/me_cl... On X200-era systems, however, you can remove IME entirely from the flash, which is what I did. I put only Coreboot and GRUB2 on the flash, but you can add SeaBIOS to that, if you want more PC BIOS facilities and options available. (So I stockpiled a few backup units of the X200, before they disappeared from the market, or the available units got too beaten up or expensive.) reply vel0city 5 hours agorootparentI seen to recall having some Thinkpads which had a firmware setting that would irrecoverably break the management engine. It had a lot of scary warnings about disabling it, and likewise features like SGX wouldn't work properly from what I could tell. I think they were T460S'es, but I could be misremembering. reply divingdragon 1 hour agorootparentThere is an official way to completely disable and remove Computrace (which I did on my T480), but I don't remember anything that allowed removing ME. reply syene 2 hours agoparentprevDo you remember the name of that story? reply guenthert 29 minutes agoprevOh, stop it, will you? I so miss my Handspring Visor (which, already considered obsolete, I bought from WeirdStuff for a whopping $5 in mint condition some ten years ago). Lost it during one of the moves ... There remains a niche for not connected digital assistants, methinks. reply layer8 11 hours agoprevI like how clearly scrollability is indicated on PalmOS, even without a scrollbar. reply hypercube33 10 hours agoparentFeels like MacOS, chrome and edge and Windows all are pushing for 5px wide auto hidden scroll bars. I miss the chunky touch friendly ones that were easy to use, honestly. that said to build off your comment - everything on Palm felt extremely thought about for ease and obvious use end to end and it's part of why I absolutely miss it. reply rkagerer 7 hours agorootparentPalm had the best mobile UI I've ever used. The stuff out of Apple and Android seems like candy with saturated fats by comparison. reply felixding 39 minutes agorootparentExactly this. I'd go back to a modern Treo 650 any day. reply zx8080 8 hours agorootparentprevDoes anyone know whether the Palm UI/UX elements are protected by IP/patents? Meaning cannot use these ideas or elements in new projects without fear of a lawsuit from whoever owns the Palm IP legacy now. reply wtallis 7 hours agorootparentIt's old enough that patents are definitely not an issue, and dead enough that trademarks are probably defunct. So any imitation/inspiration that falls short of obvious copyright infringement is unlikely to run into trouble. reply mrd3v0 5 hours agorootparentprevUI/UX patents? Outside of the US it is hard to see how a court would validate that. IIRC they are excluded from patentability in the EU. reply varjag 6 minutes agorootparentYou can absolutely register your designs with EU patent office. https://www.euipo.europa.eu/en/designs reply afitnerd 5 hours agoprevThis is cool. I wrote a TOTP authenticator for the ArduBoy: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/08/30/build-one-time-pa... reply Tijdreiziger 9 hours agoprevThe linked one for J2ME phones is also fascinating: https://github.com/baumschubser/hotpants reply mrweasel 3 hours agoparentThat is really cool. I basically need two features in a phone, tethering and TOTP. reply pushedx 12 hours agoprevTOTP on a GameBoy cart using a cart with an RTC would be awesome. reply codetrotter 11 hours agoparentDouble awesome if it’s one of those carts that can slot another cart into it, and then you pair it with a Game Boy Camera to scan TOTP setup QR codes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera reply jsheard 11 hours agoparentprevMost flashcarts have the RTC function so that should be doable with off-the-shelf hardware. reply pushedx 10 hours agorootparentright, I've got one of those on my shelf here but it needs a new battery reply lxgr 10 hours agoparentprevAnd then run it in Liberty, in a Palm OS emulator :) reply IvyMike 9 hours agoprevAlso of interest, from a few years ago: TOTP board that fits into classic Casio F-91W wrist watch: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33243434 reply dallas 7 hours agoparentI got a Sensor Watch Lite after reading about it here on HN. LOVE IT. I don't use the TOTP complication but I did add a number of D&D dice rolling modes. reply mistyvales 7 hours agorootparentI love mine as well, but a TOTP one would be awesome.. I'll have to look that up reply RachelF 7 hours agoprevStyleTap https://styletap.com/ runs PalmOS apps on Android. reply basementcat 9 hours agoprevMorning Standup at a state-sponsored hacking organization Bob: Happy Monday everybody! Before we start, just want to give a shoutout to Fred and Jane for that Ether address poisoning attack last week! I know you two really worked hard on that one! Polite applause echos through real and virtual space. Bob: Igor, can you get us started this morning? Igor: Bah, I finally managed to exfiltrate metadata from my target's home TI-99/4 with combined TI BASIC and TMS9900 machine language exploit using security hole in speech synthesizer peripheral... Bob: Igor, can you get to the point? Igor: OK OK, bottom line, my target is hosting their TOTP authenticator on Palm OS instead of Android or iOS! I mean actual Palm Pilot, not some retro hipster pink iPhone running an emulator! Maybe if I can write and induce target to install trojaned PRC file into their Palm Pilot... Bob: Fortunately we're a state sponsored hacking organization with considerable resources. Jeff, do you think you can help Igor? Jeff: Yo, whatcha need? reply z3phyr 4 hours agoparentThis feels like a normal valley office setting. With l33t stuff, I imagine rave parties like in the matrix, and hackers banging away at their keyboards doing funky things. reply j45 9 hours agoparentprevA Palm Pilot probably wouldn't have wifi and it's a good chance it would be reasonably airgapped. Other Palm OS devices for sure though :) reply rkagerer 7 hours agorootparentSome of us had Enfora Wifi sleds. reply j45 4 hours agorootparentHaha, fair. The literal palm pilots seemed to pre-date these wifi cards. A Palm Pilot Pro only took a triple a battery and a 1 MB memory card. Sleds came later iirc reply xattt 11 hours agoprevThe juxtaposition of a TOTP with a rosary app suggests, at least to me, that you’ll need to authenticate at the pearly gates. Make sure to keep your recovery codes. reply userbinator 7 hours agoparentI remember when PalmOS devices were common, many \"apps\" available for them were of a religious nature. Various versions of The Bible were popular. reply hobobaggins 6 hours agoprevThis is cool. You probably have to extract and transport in (SD card?) the TOTP secret, since I imagine a a QR code reader built isn't built-in. reply ranger_danger 12 hours agoprevCool. I also wrote one in nuklear that works on Win9x and up, MacOS8/9/X-up, *nix and even BeOS/Haiku. reply TacticalCoder 8 hours agoparentNice! I wrote one running in text-mode, which I ran for years on an old, non-networked, Raspberry Pi 2 (no WiFi capability on that one). I'd need to unlock my app with a password. I just reused some Java TOTP API and wrote a tiny app around it. reply gelstudios 12 hours agoparentprevI would love to see that, especially if the project builds cleanly on all those platforms. reply The_SamminAter 8 hours agorootparentLikewise. reply ranger_danger 8 hours agorootparentprevit does, single Makefile reply mistyvales 10 hours agoprevHow does one use a Palm OS phone with no 4g/3g support? Can you even get 2g service anymore? reply aidenn0 10 hours agoparentNot sure if you're aware, but most of the Palm OS devices weren't phones. I owned 3, none of which were (but my wife had a Centro). Only one of those 3 had wifi; everything else was via syncing with the PC over a cable (or BT in later models). reply mistyvales 9 hours agorootparentTotal brain fart: For some reason I thought OP said Blackberry! I had a few Palm Pilots back in the day.. no idea what I did with them. They're pretty damn cheap on eBay. On that note, what's the last good Blackberry with physical keyboard that could even be used today? 4g voLTE support is probably a no go. reply LeoPanthera 10 hours agoparentprevThe short answer is that you can't. reply gunapologist99 9 hours agorootparentWell, you can use it as a Palm device, but the phone capabilities will be forever broken :'( reply LeoPanthera 9 hours agorootparentI know someone who put a private GSM cellular base station in their attic just so that their collection of retro phones would work. I suppose that's an option. I think the FCC lets you do it without a license below a certain wattage. reply userbinator 7 hours agorootparentI think that's technically illegal but more of a \"if you transmit on licensed spectrum but no one can hear it but you, does it still count?\" situation. reply wkat4242 1 hour agorootparentHere in Europe the DECT guard band is often used for this and i think it's not illegal. About the US no idea but they have the 915 band right? reply acjohnson55 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's pretty sweet. What kind of hardware is necessary for this? reply wkat4242 1 hour agorootparentLook up Osmocom reply LeoPanthera 8 hours agorootparentprevI have no idea. I wonder if you could do it with some kind of SDR radio, these days. reply ranger_danger 7 hours agorootparentfor 2G GSM you could reply j45 9 hours agorootparentprevBy phone it meant making phone calls and not surfing, so the phone capabilities and sms capabilities were fine. reply j45 9 hours agoparentprevWifi existed. Bluetooth data existed too (Bluetooth Dial up Networking). reply tantalic 12 hours agoprevFINALLY reply GlacierFox 10 hours agoprev [–] Top of The Pops? reply hi_hi 8 hours agoparent [–] This is what I immediately think of too. Unfortunately, unless you're of a specific age and from the UK, the painful mental juggling act you have to go through every time you see TOTP won't be relatable. reply silentsea90 6 hours agorootparent [–] Or you listen to a lot of 80s music :) reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
