The nearly 400-foot (120-meter) Starship carried no people or satellites.SpaceX later said multiple engines on the 33-engine booster were not firing as the rocket ascended, causing it to lose altitude and begin to tumble. The rocket was intentionally destroyed by its self-destruct system, exploding and plummeting into the water.Instead of a best-case-scenario 1 1/2-hour flight with the spacecraft on top peeling away and taking a lap around the world, the whole thing lasted four minutes. The rocket reached a maximum speed of about 1,300 mph (2,100 kph) and as high as 24 miles (39 kilometers), before going sideways and dropping.Throngs of spectators watched from South Padre Island, several miles away from the Boca Chica Beach launch site, which was off-limits. As Starship lifted off with a thunderous roar, the crowd screamed: \u201cGo, baby, go!\u201dMusk, in a tweet, called it \u201can exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months.\u201d SpaceX termed it a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly.\u201dIn the weeks leading up to the flight, Musk gave 50-50 odds that the spacecraft would reach orbit. He stressed that clearing the launch tower and not blowing up the pad would be a win.\u201cYou never know exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said SpaceX livestream commentator and engineer John Insprucker. \u201cBut as we promised, excitement is guaranteed and Starship gave us a rather spectacular end.\u201dAt liftoff, the rocket kicked up huge plumes of sand and dust around the pad. In Port Isabel, about 10 miles (6 kilometers) away, particles covered cars and other surfaces. The only other report, said John Sandoval, assistant to the city manager, was a shattered window at a local business. \u201cYes, it shook, rattled and rolled,\u201d he said of the rocket.The Federal Aviation Administration said it would oversee the accident investigation, noting that no injuries or public property damage were reported. The agency also said that until it determines that there is no threat to public safety, Starships are grounded.SpaceX intends to use Starship to send people and cargo to the moon and, eventually, Mars. NASA has reserved a Starship for its next moonwalking team, and rich tourists are already booking lunar flybys.Despite the abbreviated flight, congratulations poured in from NASA chief Bill Nelson and others in the space industry. Retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield tweeted, \u201cHuge accomplishment, huge lessons, onwards to the next attempt.\u201d\u201cIt fell somewhere between a small step and their hoped-for giant leap, but it still represents significant progress toward a reusable super-heavy lift rocket,\u201d University of Chicago\u2019s Jordan Bimm, a space historian, said in an email.At 394 feet and nearly 17 million pounds of thrust, Starship easily surpasses NASA\u2019s moon rockets \u2014 past, present and future. NASA successfully launched its new 322-foot (98-meter) moon rocket last November on a test flight, sending the empty Orion capsule around the moon.The stainless steel Starship rocket is designed to be fully reusable with fast turnaround, dramatically lowering costs, similar to what SpaceX\u2019s smaller Falcon rockets have done soaring from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Nothing was to be saved from this test flight, with the spacecraft \u2014 if all had gone well \u2014 aiming for a watery grave in the Pacific near Hawaii.The futuristic spacecraft flew several miles into the air during testing a few years ago, landing successfully only once. But this was the inaugural launch of the first-stage booster with 33 methane-fueled engines.SpaceX has more boosters and spacecraft lined up for more test flight; the next set is almost ready to go. Musk wants to fire them off in quick succession, so he can start using Starships to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit and then put people on board.It was the second launch attempt. Monday\u2019s try was scrapped by a frozen booster valve.Jason and Lisa Flores drove down from Corpus Christi to watch the launch with their daughter, and noticed something was amiss.Lisa Flores cried seeing the liftoff and then realized, \u201cIt\u2019s not working out the way it was supposed to.\u201dElizabeth Trujillo, 13, wearing a \u201cStar Wars\u201d shirt and carrying toy binoculars, skipped school to see the launch from the beach with her mother and other relatives. The crowd cheered when Starship cleared the tower.Despite the failed attempt, \u201cit was worth it,\u201d said Jessica Trujillo, Elizabeth\u2019s mother. \u201cJust hearing and seeing the view, the excitement of the crowd, it was priceless.\u201d\u201cPractice makes perfect. They just got to practice some more,\u201d she added.___AP reporter Valerie Gonzalez contributed.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

So I thought I\u2019d explain how they work before I forget.A spinning cubeWe can build a spinning cube, with a letter at each vertex.ABCDEFGHFor the HTML, we make a div for each letter and position it with translate3d:<div id=\"cube\" style=\"width: 4em; height: 8em;\"> <div style=\"transform: translate3d(0em, 0em, 2em)\">A</div> <div style=\"transform: translate3d(4em, 0em, 2em)\">B</div> \u2026 <div style=\"transform: translate3d(0em, 4em, -2em)\">G</div> <div style=\"transform: translate3d(4em, 4em, -2em)\">H</div></div>(I use em units, but px or any other unit is fine too. The cube is 4em wide and the vertices are centered around x=2em and z=0em, making it easy to spin about the center.)For the CSS, we set an animation on the parent from rotateY(0turn) to rotateY(1turn):#cube { position: relative; transform-style: preserve-3d; animation: spin 20s linear infinite;}#cube > div { position: absolute; transform-style: preserve-3d;}@keyframes spin { from { transform: rotateX(-0.1turn) rotateY(0turn); } to { transform: rotateX(-0.1turn) rotateY(1turn); }}(Note that 1turn equals 360deg. And we add a slight tilt rotateX(-0.1turn) to make things look better. Finally, for the 3d positions to work, we need preserve-3d and position: relative on the parent, and position: absolute on the children.)Put it all together and we get:ABCDEFGHNotice that the letter glyphs themselves are rotating, which is neat, but could make the diagram hard to read.Un-spinning the lettersTo keep the letters facing forwards, we can \u2018un-spin\u2019 them in sync with the spinning parent, but in the opposite direction.ABCDEFGHTo accomplish this we add another div around each letter, where we can perform the un-spinning without interfering with the existing transform:<div id=\"cube\" style=\"width: 4em; height: 8em;\"> <div style=\"transform: translate3d(0em, 0em, 2em)\"><div>A</div></div> <div style=\"transform: translate3d(4em, 0em, 2em)\"><div>B</div></div> \u2026 <div style=\"transform: translate3d(0em, 4em, -2em)\"><div>G</div></div> <div style=\"transform: translate3d(4em, 4em, -2em)\"><div>H</div></div></div>We keep the CSS from before, but give the new inner divs an un-spinning animation from rotateY(0turn) to rotateY(-1turn):#cube > div > div { animation: un-spin 20s linear infinite;}@keyframes un-spin { from { transform: rotateY(0turn); } to { transform: rotateY(-1turn); }}All together this looks like:ABCDEFGHI was pleasantly surprised that all this spinning and un-spinning seems to perform fine even on mobile browsers.You can even select the rotating text and your selection will rotate as well\u2014impressive work by the browser builders.k=1\u2211nk3=12222\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5nnnnThe original math thing involved a few other tricks\u2014to embed the diagrams in LaTeX and generate their geometries\u2014which for completeness I\u2019ll describe as a footnote.1The source of the original math thing is a Markdown/LaTeX file.Each diagram is embedded in the LaTeX as a numeric ID, which is then replaced with generated HTML by a Python script. (The IDs are all at the bottom of the script, after a long mess of typesetting hacks and NumPy geometry.)The Python script is run after the Markdown and LaTeX have been rendered because it\u2019s specified with postprocess in the Markdown front matter, which triggers a post_convert Jekyll hook thanks to a bespoke Jekyll plugin.Lastly, the relevant CSS will look familiar if you\u2019ve read this far. \u21a9",
    "summary": "- The spinning diagrams presented do not use JavaScript or animated image formats; rather, just HTML and CSS.\n- A spinning cube with letters at each vertex can be made using the transform property and keyframe animations with rotateX and rotateY.\n- To keep the letters facing forward while spinning, another div around each letter can perform the unspinning with an opposite keyframe animation.\n- The spinning and unspinning works well on mobile browsers and allows for even selected text to rotate.\n- The original math thing involved other tricks such as embedding diagrams in LaTeX and generating geometries with a Python script.",

    "hn_content": "Swedish VPN provider, Mullvad, was served a search warrant, according to a report by Hacker News. Many commenters found it unlikely that after the authorities arrived with a warrant in hand, Mullvad was able to demonstrate and consult with the prosecutor that no customer data was stored on their servers. The event has brought up discussion about how often seizures would need to be made to support any purely financial case for businesses known not to store identifying information. Mullvad has released a statement saying that no customer data was taken or compromised during the incident.Mullvad VPN informed police that the servers containing the data relevant to a case they had a warrant for didn't exist and proved it to the police's satisfaction.; Mullvad has invested in \"diskless infrastructure,\" where everything is provisioned to RAM on boot, so data does not need to be stored at all.; Mullvad's clean patch panel and direct runs between equipment make it easier to demonstrate to law enforcement that what they see matches the device map and how it's configured.; The process of executing a warrant in Sweden and the U.S. may differ.Discussion among users on the use of VPNs for privacy and security online. One user recommends using a VPN on a VM to prevent apps on a computer from \"phoning home.\" Another user notes the difficulty in achieving true anonymity due to browser fingerprinting, and suggests using more common hardware configurations or sandboxing a browser in a VM. Another user defends using a VPN for safe public Wi-Fi use. Overall, the discussion highlights the various reasons why people use VPNs and the challenges of achieving complete privacy online.The post discusses the potential drawbacks of using a VPN to maintain anonymity on the internet, including the possibility of multiple apps on a computer \"phoning home\" and correlating identifying information with a VPN connection. However, using a VPN correctly can still be effective in obscuring one's identity. The post also highlights the importance of using a VPN in countries where internet traffic is heavily censored or monitored, and suggests alternative methods such as running a VPN within a Docker container or using multiple virtual machines. One VPN provider mentioned is Mullvad, although it is noted that some of its servers are blacklisted.Mullvad VPN, a Swedish VPN provider, was recently subject to a search warrant, but customer data was not compromised according to the company. This incident highlights the difficulties of providing full anonymity through a VPN, as malicious users can also take advantage of the service. While Mullvad customers are reassured by the company's promise of not collecting personal identifiable information (PII), the possibility of the company logging traffic for specific entities cannot be entirely ruled out. The ongoing investigation is subject to \"f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningssekretess,\" which means that public information is unavailable until charges are brought to court.Mullvad VPN's reputation for privacy and security is praised, but users should still exercise caution and not completely trust the company's claims. Mullvad does not advertise or engage in flashy sponsorships like other VPN companies, which some view as a positive indicator of their reliability. However, trusting any company entirely is a vulnerability, and VPNs, in general, require trust. Mullvad is working on a remote attestation system to allow clients to verify the exact version of the software running on servers. While VPNs provide more privacy for specific parts of online activity, they do not offer complete privacy from all potential threats.Mullvad, a VPN provider, accepts mail-in cash payments to allow for anonymous transactions. Payment tokens are generated through their website, and envelopes containing the token and cash are destroyed through shredding. Through anonymous payment, users hope to maintain anonymity on the internet, however, investigators can still identify plausible suspects through metadata correlation. Metadata correlation allows investigators to trace the stamps on an envelope to a specific post office, deduce where the stamp was bought and which user purchased it, and find implementing suspicious activity.VPN users discuss paying with Bitcoin and alternative payment methods like vouchers and cash. Some express concerns about privacy and trust in VPN companies, while others suggest that audits and external verification can increase trust. The discussion highlights the importance of anonymity and the risk of data compromise.The discussion revolves around Mullvad, a VPN service provider, and its claim to not store any user data. A user recommends using a specific site to purchase Mullvad vouchers with Bitcoin lightning invoice. Some users express skepticism about the claim of no data storage and suggest verifying it. A former VPN owner warns against relying solely on VPN for privacy, and a commenter recommends various steps for maximum privacy. Another user suggests investigating claims of no data storage. Finally, it is noted that police withdrew a warrant after Mullvad explained why it was pointless, but some users find this out of the ordinary.Swedish VPN provider, Mullvad, had a Swedish police search warrant served on their offices in Gothenburg by at least six police officers from the National Operations Department. Mullvad VPN has denied to the officers that it keeps any logs of users.\n \nKey Points:\n \n- Mullvad has been served with a search warrant by the Swedish police, however, the VPN provider, who claims not to keep logs, states that the police came out empty-handed.\n- Mullvad has been a vocal opponent to the chat control proposal, and it is suspected that this could be why the Swedish police have targeted the VPN provider.\n- VPN providers as an industry have a bad reputation, often collecting and using user data in ways that violate their own terms of service, and even using hacked boxes as VPN endpoints to get people onto residential IP ranges.- Y Combinator (YC) has opened applications for its Summer 2023 program.\n- YC is a prestigious startup accelerator program that provides funding and mentorship to selected startups.\n- The program has launched successful companies such as Airbnb, Dropbox, and Reddit.\n- YC stated that applicants can apply from anywhere in the world and welcomed startups from different industries.\n- The application deadline is not stated, but interested parties can follow the application link on the YC website.",
    "hn_summary": "- Mullvad VPN was served with a search warrant but reassured customers that no customer data was compromised.\n- Mullvad has invested in diskless infrastructure and has a clean patch panel, making it easier to demonstrate to law enforcement that no data was stored.\n- Discussion among users highlights the reasons people use VPNs and the challenges of achieving complete privacy online."

    "content": "RIP Legit Torrents 2005-2023TL;DR - The server was null routed at the host and with no time and no 1 click way spin it up again I decided to throw in the towel. The rest is a fun look back.I started Legit Torrents in the Fall of 2005. I was still in high school and back then there was no 100% legal torrent tracker that anyone could easily submit to. There was legaltorrents.com, but if memory serves me correctly, it was more of a curated thing.I was super cheap back then, not even wanting to shell out for a domain name, so the original URL was virtenu.dyndns.org/lt. Eventually I bought the .info for $0.99 after the site picked up some speed a few months later.After some convincing, my brother was kind enough to be my 3rd user (after the default admin account and my own personal user account) and obliged me in posting comments to make it seem more lively. Thanks bro.A few more shout outs to the XBT project that provided the high performance backend, as well as the XBTIT project for the front end which is still going strong.I ran it out of my bedroom at my parents house for a long time, eventually switching over to a VPS sometime when I moved out. I cannot state enough how much I learned from running this site and others. Way better than a degree in my opinion. Web development, marketing, server administration, ect. It was one of my first exposures to implementing SEO (what I now do for a living), which funny enough was mostly copied tags from The Pirate Bay and modified to be about legal torrents instead.The early days was where a lot of time was spent trying to tell people about the website. Some of my fondest memories are of being at school on Digg.com (back before the v4 fiasco of course) and posting comments to the Upcoming / Hot section where stories were at right before they hit the front page. Almost always the first comments in the thread would become the top comments, with no way to sort, and I would always sign my comment with legittorrents.info. Then later I would come back and check the Google Analytics stats to see those sweet sweet traffic spikes.This site was also how I made my first dollar online. Google Adsense was profitable on the site for many years, earning me some really nice pay checks here and there. That is, until I got my Adsense account banned by trying out some too good to be true website purchases that turned out to be using fraudulent clicks. Since there there has been next to no profit, and that was years ago.Later on I redesigned the site to have a very cool custom Web 2.0 style, something I worked quite diligently on after graduating from a local college. I left it that way from then on and I still think it's pretty rad.I had a routine in the early years, to check through a list of sites for new torrents to add to my site. I had always wanted to automate it, but never succeeded in doing so. Being a digital hoarder has it perks though, and that folder is still a part of my bookmarks. Looking through it most of them are dead of course, but a few of my favorites were:PlaneShiftRevision3gameupdates.orgvodo.netPure PwnageCube 2: SauerbratenLinuxtrackerOf course, I always enjoyed seeing what super random things people would upload also.I helped my friends launch an album that they produced, which I had \u201cpinned\u201d to the torrents page for a long time. Not sure it really helped them gain international fame or anything, but it was cool to see people download and enjoy the music. Someone kept seeding or trying to download it it recently actually which was entertaining since it was from 2008 I think.One time I got a take down from \u201cThe Web-Sheriff\u201d and used it as a chance to get some publicity. Probably not the right thing to do, but that turned into an article on TorrentFreak, which I thought was pretty cool to be on.In the end there were about ~50,000 registered users, ~5,500 torrents, ~22M tracked pageviews over the course of time. It doesn't seem like much when its typed out like that, at least compared to platforms nowadays, but pretty cool still.It's not an easy thing to say goodbye to this silly site. It has been a part of my entire adult life. For ~17 years it was always there for me to check on, moderate, and take care of. It had me feeling like I was doing a part of something good for the internet I suppose. That is confirmed as I look through mentions of the site with a Google search.If you ever used Legit Torrents, I sincerely hope it helped you. My mission in life is love Jesus and love others, and I think Legit Torrents did that in some weird techy way.If you have something to share about the site, please drop me a line, I would love to hear it: en3r0[DOT]x[AT]gmail[DOT]com .",

    "hn_content": "The Legit Torrents site has been shut down by its owner after 17 years of operation, due to a lack of profit since losing their Google AdSense account. The closure has led to discussions about the lack of competition in online advertising and how micropayments could be an alternative source of revenue for websites, instead of solely relying on ads. Contributors to the forum debated personal responsibility towards company injustices and the role of government regulation in preventing them. The desire for independent, innovative solutions to be developed was highlighted, along with the need for more competition in the online advertising market.Micropayments are not popular due to their inconvenience and tendency to run afoul of human behavioral costing models. Visa, Mastercard, and banks also have not developed an easy, friction-free micropayment system. The regulatory environment also prevents transactions for small amounts from being caveat emptor. Stored balance wallets like Cash App, Venmo or PayPal could feasibly support micropayments. However, failed startups have shown that there is not enough user demand for micropayments. Trust is also a significant issue, as microtransactions have no room for refunds and can lead to scamming if not adequately regulated. Brave's monthly pot of money is an alternative to microtransactions, but advertizers value user views/clicks more.The discussion revolves around the idea of paying for website usage without ads and the balance of market forces vs. the true cost of running a site. The current ad model is considered the most effective for business, but it may not be desirable for users. Monopolies and market inefficiencies are also criticized. Various proposed solutions include micropayments and tiered pricing for users and sites, but there are concerns about pricing tiers being abused by content providers. Overall, there is no clear-cut solution, and the topic raises many potential unintended consequences.Commenters discuss the feasibility of micropayments for ad-free browsing on websites, with disagreements about the practicality and user experience of such a system. Some argue that transparent and customizable micropayments could work, while others worry about added mental load and an abuse of the system. Several examples are given, including private torrent trackers and URL shortening services. The idea of a legal framework for micropayments is also brought up. Overall, there is no clear consensus on whether or not micropayments are a viable solution.- Micropayments could solve the problem of abusive fraud and laundering, but the cost of transactions makes it impractical.\n- Ads can be acceptable as long as they are passive and not intrusive, but the surveillance and misuse of data is a problem.\n- Google previously offered the option to pay not to see ads, but it had limitations.\n- Lack of viable micropayments is the biggest injustice in the web industry, not the lack of competition in Ads.\n- The RIAA/MPA and copyright laws that they abuse for profit and control are the biggest threat to user freedom on the web.\n- Brave browser attempted to solve the issue of micropayments by pushing their own crypto.\n- Irrelevant ads and complicated cookie BS make the web nearly unreadable, and ads often punish those looking for deals.\n- The FOSS community is generally opposed to promotion efforts.\n- Using ad blockers such as uBlock Origin and SponsorBlock could potentially lead to a better internet.The post discusses AdSense and the experience of running a torrent site. The site admin gives their opinion about monetizing a torrent site and their experience of being banned from AdSense due to fraudulent clicks. Other commenters suggest alternative methods of monetization, such as premium features and affiliate programs. There is also a discussion about the risks of clicking on ads on torrent sites and the possibility of competitors using fraudulent clicks to get a site banned from AdSense. The nostalgia of the early web is also touched upon.The conversation takes place in a forum for legal torrenting, with users discussing various topics related to torrenting, archiving, and running a website. Suggestions include creating a software package, sharing the data set, resurrecting dead torrents, and passing on the website to someone else. Users also discuss the rise of underground file sharing for popular search terms, and the impact of SEO on useful content. The post provides a glimpse into the world of legal torrenting and the challenges faced by website owners.Comments on an HN thread include discussions on proper SEO practices, the impact of GDPR, and the use of Google AdSense. One user shares their experiences of running a website out of their parents' house while another user sympathizes with a fellow website owner who had their commercial accounts closed by the bank. The thread veers off-topic with a discussion on the finances of the porn industry and the right to banking.Banks are essential in modern society and should be treated like a utility. Essential banking services should be regulated. Banks are allowed to create money out of thin air and are heavily regulated by the government. Providing credit is a service that involves risk-taking and investment. Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend out most of the money deposited with them. Fractional reserve banking is legal, but people question its morality. The right to bank should be enshrined in the laws of free societies. Resource allocation in the economy should be subjected to democratic oversight.Adult website operators are struggling to find banks or credit unions that will establish accounts for them. Many banks have stopped doing business with adult sites since a lawsuit claimed that they were enabling Pornhub to benefit from child pornography. Even after investigations, adult sites are still being viewed as \"high risk\" and turned away by financial institutions. Though some suggested for the adult industry to adopt crypto or find alternative means of exchange, there are still limitations and complexities that arise with these options.Due to issues with payment processors, a porn website was forced to shut down, prompting discussion on the utility of cryptocurrencies in the industry. However, some commenters note that cryptocurrencies may not be user-friendly enough for less tech-savvy customers, and that the banking industry's reluctance to work with adult websites could extend to cryptocurrency exchanges. Some also argue that the adult industry is unfairly targeted by financial institutions and that self-regulation is often enough. Lastly, there is speculation about the reasons behind banks' aversion to the adult industry, with no clear explanation.Individuals and legal adult entertainment-related businesses face challenges, including difficulty finding banking or payment processors, as they violate KYC regulations. Canadian policy mandates that banks must evaluate each customer's risk with a \"Know Your Customer\" check, and those deemed too high of a risk for the bank are often rejected. Business names and activities are the reasons given for rejection, sometimes for being too innocuous. This can lead to legal and regulatory challenges that make it difficult to maintain banking relationships or accept payment for legal activities. One example is the account shutdown of Amber-Lace Entertainment Ltd., which led to the business's closure. Another challenge is website blocking and filters, which can be ineffectual and inconsistent.-Reliable exchanges for converting cryptocurrency to USD typically require customer identities (KYC)\n-This may not be ideal for adult toy/porn sites\n-Applications are open for YC Summer 2023",

Information about your use of this site is shared with DeepMind for that purposeSee detailsOK, got itResearchBlogImpactSafety & EthicsAboutCareersCompanyAnnouncing Google DeepMindApril 20, 2023Earlier today we announced some changes that will accelerate our progress in AI and help us develop more capable AI systems safely and responsibly. Below is a recap of what DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis shared with employees:Hi TeamWhen Shane Legg and I launched DeepMind back in 2010, many people thought general AI was a farfetched science fiction technology that was decades away from being a reality. Now, we live in a time in which AI research and technology is advancing exponentially. In the coming years, AI - and ultimately AGI - has the potential to drive one of the greatest social, economic and scientific transformations in history. That\u2019s why today Sundar is announcing that DeepMind and the Brain team from Google Research will be joining forces as a single, focused unit called Google DeepMind. Combining our talents and efforts will accelerate our progress towards a world in which AI helps solve the biggest challenges facing humanity, and I\u2019m incredibly excited to be leading this unit and working with all of you to build it. Together, in close collaboration with our fantastic colleagues across the Google Product Areas, we have a real opportunity to deliver AI research and products that dramatically improve the lives of billions of people, transform industries, advance science, and serve diverse communities.By creating Google DeepMind, I believe we can get to that future faster. Building ever more capable and general AI, safely and responsibly, demands that we solve some of the hardest scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For that, we need to work with greater speed, stronger collaboration and execution, and to simplify the way we make decisions to focus on achieving the biggest impact.Through Google DeepMind, we are bringing together our world-class talent in AI with the computing power, infrastructure and resources to create the next generation of AI breakthroughs and products across Google and Alphabet, and to do this in a bold and responsible way. The research advances from the phenomenal Brain and DeepMind teams laid much of the foundations of the current AI industry, from Deep Reinforcement Learning to Transformers, and the work we are going to be doing now as part of this new combined unit will create the next wave of world-changing breakthroughs.Sundar, Jeff Dean, James Manyika, and I have built a fantastic partnership as we\u2019ve worked to coordinate our efforts over recent months. I am looking forward to working closely with Eli Collins, who will be joining my leads team as VP of Product, and Zoubin Ghahramani who will be joining the research leadership team reporting to Koray Kavukcuoglu. We\u2019re also creating a new Scientific Board for Google DeepMind to oversee research progress and direction of the unit, which will be led by Koray and will have representatives from across the orgs. Jeff, Koray, Zoubin, Shane and myself will be finalising the composition of this board together in the coming days.I\u2019m sure you will have lots of questions about what this new unit will look like for you, your teams, and all of us, and we will be working hard to provide clarity for everyone as rapidly as possible. Please read Sundar\u2019s note, and tune in to the town hall meeting tomorrow.I\u2019m thrilled to be on this journey with you and look forward to seeing everyone soon.

    "hn_content": "Google's DeepMind team suffers from a lack of understanding of product commercialization and execution. Google needs product managers and pragmatic engineers, not just smart AI researchers and ethicists. DeepMind is an exceptional research project but needs leadership that can transform that work into commercialized products. Google has revealed how its ad business has made it lazy and risk-averse, resulting in a promotion-based culture that prevents innovation. Similarly, Kodak, Microsoft, and Xerox missed some game-changing technologies due to a failure in imagination, resulting in a focus solely on what could improve their current products.The post features a conversation on the dominance of various tech companies in different eras, with AOL and Microsoft being highlighted. It also discusses the profitability of AI products and gives examples such as Google Photos and Spotify recommendations. The conversation touches upon Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and the potential profitability of Copilot. Finally, it includes comments on OpenAI's growth and revenue predictions, with skeptics questioning their credibility.OpenAI's GPT-4 could have a large potential customer base, with potential popularity among students and educators, but there is some debate on the conversion rate of free to paid users for B2C freemium products like GPT. OpenAI's API is profitable through start-up funding and charging its customers for API use. Some argue that Google is more interested in pushing the research envelope than building products, and that Google doesn't need product managers, but rather a visionary to yank the empire builders out and focus on product building.Google's focus on mining user data for ads makes it difficult for them to make money through projects like Cloud. However, they have given away the best things they've produced, such as Colab, Docs, and Scholar. Google's ad business and control of the browser and mobile OS markets make them a difficult competitor to dislodge, but competition is necessary for survival in the AI space. DeepMind's team is trusted, but Google's ability to execute on AI products has been weak. Anthropic and DeepMind are likely Google's primary focus for AI. Google needs product managers who can commercialize their underlying technology.Google's execution in the AI industry is not as good as OpenAI's, which has recently partnered with Microsoft. Large companies with profitable monopolies become too cautious, making them susceptible to being surpassed by newcomers. The typical solution, intra-entrepreneurship, may not work as well as being surrounded by hungry and scrappy people. OpenAI's advantage is that they have figured out how to fast track research into products or have researchers more willing to worry about production. OpenAI\u2019s scientists give more importance to seeing how people interact with their bot, giving them more motivation for research. The game-changer technology, Alpha Fold, was given away, whereas Microsoft's primary objective is to provoke an arms race with Google through OpenAI.Scientists debate whether Alpha Fold can be classified as AGI. However, GPT-4 is not significant enough to be considered a game changer for the tech industry. Despite being a useful tool, GPT-4 is not revolutionary, and it produces plausible-looking nonsense that is often misleadingly wrong. Professional exams, such as the medical boards or bar exam, pose little challenge for GPT-4. While it may have a lot of knowledge, it lacks logical thinking skills and cannot handle problems beyond the well-trodden path. It can define new concepts and new words and is successful at simple reasoning, but it is not actual thinking.- GPT AI technology is replacing professionals across multiple industries such as software engineers, brand consultants, and accountants.\n- There are arguments about whether GPT constitutes AGI, but it is capable of performing a wide range of tasks simultaneously and exhibits general intelligence across multiple fields.\n- GPT is particularly strong in computing and programming tasks, but it struggles with other fields, particularly in physics.\n- While GPT can generate useful code, it is not perfect and can sometimes produce unhelpful and non-existent results.\n- Despite some limitations, GPT is a game-changer for writing, coding, and other disciplines but requires proper prompting and learning its strengths.ChatGPT is a generative AI that is capable of generating complex code and improving it when prompted but is not capable of reason or applying its knowledge like an AGI. The domain of protein structure, which AlphaFold predicts, may have significant implications in biology. Generative AI is a new area of research with many issues, including hallucination, bias, and legal baggage. The cost of running GPT 3.5 for real-time results is six to seven figures a year, making it a major gamble for companies. Google has not executed on products for generative AI, but has been successful in other domains.- Google is one of the leaders in AI research\n- Google has vast amounts of data and compute resources to train machine learning models on\n- OpenAI and Google have different ethical stances on AI development\n- Large language models (LLMs) are the end-game for NLP and CV tasks\n- ChatGPT is a brand owned by OpenAI but Google has the potential to compete if they can fix their language model quality and find a profitable business model for LLMs\n- Access controls for personal data at Google are strictGoogle trains on people's personal data and is the largest online advertiser in the world. Gmail used to push personalized ads into inboxes, based on users' online activity while logged in. Despite stating not to scan or read Gmail messages to show ads, this process train their datasets on people's PII. OpenAI subverted Google and selling out to Microsoft. Though Google is great at technology, it cares too much about what the EU and governments everywhere think of them now, no longer a profit-making entity that disrupts and pushes the rules, and rather part of maintaining the status quo.Google's sponsored ads are becoming less distinguishable from search results over time, with only small labels on mobile indicating that an item is sponsored. One user pointed out a 2016 article from a web designer that detailed how Google made ads resemble search results; however, Google representatives have argued that advertising-sponsored search engines are akin to inevitable biases. Meanwhile, users on Hacker News discussed the efficiency of Google's AI research, noting that while the company may be talented in the research arena, it struggles to profitably commercialize its innovations.- Debate over Google's ability to successfully produce products despite its research capabilities\n- OpenAI is being viewed more positively due to their success with PPO algorithm and creating well-known products such as ChatGPT\n- DeepMind and Google Brain have also created notable products such as AlphaGo and Transformer, but not as well-known to the public\n- Discussion on the importance of being able to bring research and innovation to the market and make it profitable\n- Some criticism towards Google's lack of innovation and focus on revenue instead\n- Arguments over the profitability and financial impact of DeepMind and OpenAI on Google and Microsoft respectively.Google's relevance in the AI industry is under scrutiny, with some speculating that they are rushing to field competing products to maintain market-share. Google has split AI research between DeepMind and Google Brain, and reportedly invested $300m in Anthropic, though there are doubts about the company's ability to execute on AI innovation. Despite LLM technology originations from Google in the past, the company's track record in product management and revenue streams has many concerned, especially compared to Microsoft's $13bn investment in OpenAI, their diverse revenue streams, and working relationships with the US government.Despite having a lot of data, Google has yet to utilize it for AI. They have no business plan and haven't announced any upgrades. OpenAI, on the other hand, has been able to make a better product in less than a decade with fewer resources. Big successful companies tend to bend towards regulatory capture after a period of upstart growth and disruption. IBM had decades to perfect search, but it wasn't their core competency. The primary goal of Google's management culture is delivering advertisements.",

    "hn_content": "A Medium article by Keith McNulty presents a mathematical proof of finding the one and only pair of integers which satisfy the equation m^n = n^m. One possible approach includes raising both sides to the power of 1/(nm), resulting in n^(1/n) = m^(1/m), which leads to finding two distinct positive integers satisfying this formula. The proof requires an understanding of differential calculus and number theory. Several commenters suggest alternative methods and point out that logs or prime factorizations are not always necessary.A discussion on a proof of n^n * n^(m-n) = n^m = m^n. Users debate the simplicity and accuracy of the proof, with one noting its similarity to a proof in a number theory textbook. Another user questions the validity of using a continuous approach to solve a discrete problem, while others provide examples of number systems that allow for solving problems within another number system. Nonstandard analysis is also mentioned.The post discusses using hyperreal numbers for analysis or calculus, but they may not be suitable for playing around with the number system. The author suggests using your own number systems if you need infinitesimals. The comments include discussions of a mathematical proof involving integers and real numbers, with some counterexamples given. Additionally, the commenters discuss using subsets of the real numbers, and alternative proofs for mathematical problems. Not a particularly exciting post, but useful for those interested in mathematics.A user on HN posts that \"m/n is only an integer if m/n is an integer\", leading to a discussion on proof justifications. A post on Medium provides a proof demonstrating that there are only two distinct positive integers that satisfy the equation m^n = n^m. The proof uses techniques such as limits and derivatives. Some users critique the proof's level of detail while others praise its clarity. One user poses a similar math problem for discussion. Another user provides a link to bypass the Medium loginwall. There is a discussion about the article's misleading title.A recent article explores why only one pair of distinct positive integers satisfies the equation n^m = m^n. The answer can be found by analyzing the ln x / x function and determining that it is monotonically increasing in the range (0,e) and monotonically decreasing in the range (e,inf). Therefore, one pair of equal but distinct values must be from each range. The only possible solution is (2,4) or (4,2). The article uses a graphical approach rather than a formal proof to explain the concept, making it more accessible to non-mathematical readers.No meaningful content.",

    "content": "United States | Tiny trucksRural Americans are importing tiny Japanese pickup trucksBigger isn\u2019t always betterApr 20th 2023 | CHICAGOShareAcouple of years ago Jake Morgan, a farmer who lives just outside Raleigh, in North Carolina, realised he needed a new vehicle to get around his property. At first he was looking at \u201cside-by-sides\u201d\u2014a sort of off-road utility vehicle. But watching a review on YouTube of one that costs around $30,000 made by John Deere, he saw a comment that said something like \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get a minitruck instead?\u201d That is, a tiny four-wheel drive pickup truck, sometimes known as a \u201cKei\u201d truck, mostly made in Japan to take advantage of laws there which tax smaller vehicles less.Intrigued, Mr Morgan started researching. Within a few months, he drove to Newport, Virginia to pick up a 1997 Honda Acty, having spent a total of just $2,000 on importing it. He was delighted. Not only was it \u201cdirt cheap\u201d, but the Acty is less than five feet wide, and so can get into tight spaces a normal pickup cannot, like Mr Morgan\u2019s barn. And unlike a side-by-side, it can also be driven legally on local roads. \u201cThey\u2019re amazingly useful,\u201d he says. Not long after importing his first, he sold it and bought another. The new one is even better\u2014it has air-conditioning and a button which activates a dumper.Already have an account?

The rule prevents the import of kei cars or micro-sized European city cars unless they are 25+ years old. Driving a moped/Vespa on American roads is a pretty big risk due to aggressive American drivers. Cyclists are perceived as \"hobbyists who go too slowly and hold everyone up\".

The quality of car brands manufactured in the US is also debated, with some claiming low quality and others perceiving them to be appropriately sized for US driving conditions. The conversation turns to protectionism and the 25% import tax on trucks, called the \u2018chicken tax\u2019, with its origin linked to political bargaining.Discussion on the legalities and challenges of importing foreign cars to the US, including kei cars and older vehicles. Some ways to bypass regulations, such as disassembling and reassembling the car as parts or converting to electric. Safety and emissions regulations play a crucial role in the import process, and California has its own stricter standards. Age exemptions exist for certain regulations, and modifications to meet standards can be costly. DOT headlights regulation can also limit innovation in car design. Some imported cars from other countries have limitations in the US market.People are discussing the difficulty of importing vehicles into the US due to safety and emissions standards, with some arguing that regulations are excessively strict. Specific topics include the 25-year age requirement, choosing practical vehicles, and the size of modern pickups. Some comments mention the interest in importing kei cars, which remain free of features like telemetry and dashboard infotainment systems, despite being less efficient than vehicles in other advanced countries. One person described the process of importing a truck and the excitement of using it. There is also a discussion about purchasing fully enclosed street-legal side-by-side vehicles.Discussion on the practicality and popularity of compact trucks in the US compared to other countries, with various models mentioned such as the Ford Maverick, Hyundai Santa Cruz, Toyota 79 Series LandCruiser, and Brazilian Ford Courier. The impact of regulatory capture and tariffs on the availability of compact trucks is also noted. Some commenters express interest in more utilitarian and cab-less pickup truck designs for hauling cargo. Some reference is made to videos and prototypes.Used mini-trucks from Japan are popular in New Zealand due to regulations that make old vehicles expensive to keep in Japan. Suzuki Carry 1.3 liter 4WD is most sought-after. Avoid coastal areas because of salt and sea-spray rust damage. Great for farmers but may be difficult to find mechanics in rural areas. Kei trucks are preferred over large pickups because they are nimble and have a lower bed that is more ergonomic to load and unload. European multipurpose vehicles such as Renault Kangoo are cheap to buy, drive, and maintain. Vans are more practical than trucks.The discussion revolves around practical car choices for everyday purposes, such as hauling equipment, family, or driving in urban areas. The most preferred options include passenger cars like Renault Kangoo, business cars such as Town Ace, NV200, HiJet, and minivans as US equivalents. There is a debate about the practicality of oversized pickup trucks, which some use as status symbols, while others prefer practicality and efficiency. Safety is an ongoing concern, and some argue the benefits of small cars. Sprinter vans are regarded as more useful than pickup trucks. RVs have a lower carbon footprint than traditional housing in certain circumstances.A comment thread on Hacker News argues about the environmental impact and social value of large trucks like Ford F-150. Some support these trucks, pointing out their practical uses like towing boats and trailers, while others criticize them as unnecessary and harmful to the environment. The argument compares trucks to other vehicles, and they comment on their various towing capacities and environmental impact. Some argue that trucks have become status symbols or hobbies, while others insist that they are indispensable workhorses. Overall, the argument raises questions about urban vs. rural lifestyles, practical value vs. appearance, and the social and environmental impacts of vehicles.There is no meaningful content in this text.There is a discussion of a kei truck and its performance on steep hills in various conditions.

    "hn_content": "Image hosting website Imgur has updated its terms of service (TOS), banning all NSFW content. The move may lead to a loss in user numbers, according to one Hacker News commentator. Imgur has become a popular image-sharing platform partly because of its explicit content, which could result in the site's demise, as has happened to other hosting platforms such as Photobucket and TinyPic. Other forum respondents said Imgur had become too slow, and had too many ads, leading to a decline in users. One commentator believed Imgur's owners, MediLab, may have made sufficient money to justify the NSFW ban.Imgur's recent move to restrict adult content has sparked discussion on how niche websites run on profits. One commenter suggested running services as non-profits if running them for profits inevitably leads to deterioration of quality. Another commenter noted how Imgur was initially created as a non-profit image host by Reddit, but later moved to profit-optimization. The discussion also touched on Reddit's recent updates on NSFW content, including forcing users to log in to access such content, and the impact on third-party apps that rely on Reddit's APIs. Some users noted how third-party apps are preferable to Reddit's official app and website despite having ads.Users of Reddit's official mobile app complain about its sluggishness, while praising the UI and performance of third-party app Dawn. Many express frustration with accidental thread collapses and the lack of user testing by the developers. Users discuss the impact of Reddit's recent NSFW content policy changes, including tagging non-pornographic content as NSFW. Several users express dissatisfaction with the new Reddit UI and lack of alternatives on mobile, with some criticizing the platform's move away from free speech.The redesign of Reddit has been controversial among users, with some preferring the old interface that is mobile-friendly and allows for anonymous scrolling, while others prefer the new design that enforces age gating and encourages user engagement. The use of ad-supported business models by technology companies is seen as a lack of respect for users, with customers and employees being treated as mere numbers. Some users have found alternatives to Reddit, such as libreddit and nitter, which provide a better UI and faster load times without restrictions. Imgur has also faced criticism for redirecting direct image links to a JS-heavy Reddit clone site. Tumblr is becoming a popular alternative for those who mix pornography consumption with non-pornographic content. Twitter and Reddit users often have separate accounts for their NSFW content.Twitter and Reddit allow multiple accounts, and it's possible to reuse the same email and phone number. Twitter technically allows the same phone number on up to 10 accounts, but it's more like 2-4 accounts in practice, and there's a cooldown period. People use alt accounts for different perspectives, to manufacture a consensus, and to manipulate opinions. It's common among trolls, marketers, reputation management firms, social media \"influencers,\" and power users. Some use alt accounts for good, to get good-quality answers to questions. Unidan, a popular Reddit figure, used alt accounts to upvote himself and was later banned. Manipulating consensus is a euphemism for manipulating opinions.Imgur is deleting all NSFW posts, prompting discussion on how the removal of NSFW content affects websites and communities. Users speculate that Imgur's decision could be based on changes in ownership or advertiser preferences for more family-friendly content. Some commenters suggest hosting and sharing images on alternative platforms, while others point out that text-based forums offer a safer alternative to explicit content. Additionally, some users express frustration with politicization and the development direction of social media platforms.Experts discuss the cost-effectiveness of using optical media for cold storage as opposed to hard drives, pointing out that the durability of media and the need for redundancy are important factors needed to be considered when weighing the options. While optical media like Blu-ray disks can last for decades, hard drives typically struggle to last over 10 years. However, the upfront cost of using optical media remains high and could take up more space. The discussion also led to some users expressing concerns about the declining relevance of image hosting services such as Imgur.Imgur\u2019s recent announcement of their plan to phase out the ability to upload images to their platform sparked a discussion on image hosting services. Comments varied from questioning the sustainability of donation-funded image hosting services to the debate around the definition of harassment and hate speech. Some also expressed their disappointment with Imgur while others suggested alternatives, such as personal sites or an expanded internet archive. There was also some discussion regarding the history of Imgur and its original purpose as Reddit\u2019s image CDN.Imgur's choice of an image as an example of \"OK\" in their policy document has been criticized for potentially violating their own harassment section. The company's TOS is also causing controversy due to the limitations on NSFW content, with some arguing that it is an issue of sexual repression. The conversation devolved into a discussion of natural rights and the responsibility of tech companies to monitor their content. There is also mention of ArchiveTeam possibly saving Imgur's content on archive.org.There is a discussion surrounding sexual openness online and how it is perceived by different cultures. Comments suggest that while some believe it is increasing, others see a decrease in a range of opinions allowed to be expressed. Topics such as deplatforming and hate speech are debated. There is also a mention of how society as a whole relates to the decision of a particular company - Imgur - to move away from pornographic content.",

Both would be exiting within the next few weeks.BuzzFeed News had long been on life-support. The company-wide layoffs and elimination of the news operation come just months after BuzzFeed had laid off 12 percent of its staff in a cost-cutting measure. That penny-pinching move, which Peretti said was necessary due to an \u201congoing audience shift to vertical video,\u201d came nine months after Peretti had bought out the majority of the BuzzFeed News staff and sacked the editor-in-chief.Peretti also framed this most recent bloodbath at BuzzFeed within the media industry trend of layoffs, stating that the company has \u201cfaced more challenges than I can count\u201d in recent years while blaming the pandemic, a \u201ctech recession, a tough economy,\u201d and a fading stock market.At the same time, the CEO also pointed the finger at himself for his \u201cdecision to overinvest in BuzzFeed News because I love their work and mission so much.\u201d He wrote that this made him \u201cslow to accept that the big platforms wouldn\u2019t provide the distribution or financial support required to support premium, free journalism purpose-built for social media.\u201dHe also noted that BuzzFeed and HuffPost, which Peretti acquired in November 2020, would open up some \u201cselect roles for members of BuzzFeed News,\u201d adding that the new jobs would be \u201caligned with those division\u2019s business goals.\u201dFurthermore, Peretti told the remaining staff that he would be focusing more of the company\u2019s energy going forward on AI. \u201cWe will empower our editorial teams at all of our brands to do the very best creative work and build an interface where that work can be repacked and brought to advertisers more effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will bring more innovation to clients in the form of creators, AI, and cultural moments that can only happen across BuzzFeed, Complex, HuffPost, Tasty and First We Feast.\u201dADVERTISINGThe news came on the same day that Insider, another digital media outlet that has been experimenting with AI, decided to slash 10 percent of its workforce.Ben Smith, the former BuzzFeed News EIC who now runs the media startup Semafor, told The Daily Beast \u201cI\u2019m really sad about\u201d the news that the news division was shutting down.David Mack, a senior reporter for BuzzFeed News, confirmed that the site was done, tweeting \u201cwhat a ride!!! 8.5 years!!!\u201d Tech reporter Katie Notopoulos, meanwhile, snarked on Twitter that \u201cthis stunt marketing for ben smith's new book is really in poor taste imo.\u201d\u2014With additional reporting by Corbin Bolies.",

Despite some controversial content, the site has received a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting, which highlights its capabilities for publishing compelling, substantial stories. Notably, the site's closure is a reflection of a challenging financial environment that has led to major layoffs and downsizing in industries, such as journalism, that used to benefit from steady financial stability.The comments section discusses the decline of journalism quality due to the rise of web media that prioritizes fluff over quality content, parasitic audience capture by social media platforms, the negative impact of ad-based business models on subscription models, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of publicly funded media outlets.

Critics also pointed to the publication of the Steele Dossier, which was mostly false, as a low point in BuzzFeed's journalism, as well as BuzzFeed's coverage of Obama during his term as \"almost uniformly uncritical and often sycophantic\". However, BuzzFeed News has also broken some great stories, including going beyond the mainstream in investigating China's mass detention of Muslims, and multiple women reportedly cooperating with the criminal investigation, and their coverage of FIFA.BuzzFeed News is shutting down due to financial struggles, resulting in the loss of 200 jobs.

Many express skepticism about BuzzFeed's focus on AI, with some claiming that it could lead to job losses.Buzzfeed, a news and entertainment website, has been struggling financially since its deSPAC. Buzzfeed CEO's love for Buzzfeed News, despite it losing money, is the reason for the site's continued existence. Other news organizations are also struggling to find sustainable funding for journalism.
