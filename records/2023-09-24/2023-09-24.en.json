The paragraphs I had just typed vanished into thin air, faster than Time Machine or Backblaze could save them. Gone. The next occurrence was during app development; Xcode suddenly flagged numerous errors in previously error-free code. My recent changes to several files were erased. Months later, the mystery is solved: iCloud Drive detected a file conflict. It assumed different versions of the same file existed on my Mac and iPhone and couldn’t merge them automatically. This was impossible; the affected files were never opened on the iPhone. But they were in iCloud, as I had moved my Mac’s Documents folder there. Dropbox manages version conflicts by storing all conflicting files side by side, labeled as “(John Doe’s conflicted copy)“. iCloud Drive, however, doesn’t show these conflicts in the file system. If you open the file in an editor that supports conflict handling, a popup appears asking which version to keep. Editors like Textifier, Xcode, or Obsidian, lacking conflict handling, leave iCloud to decide which version to store on your disk and in your backup. Over time, newer backups overwrite older ones containing the correct version; your content is gone for good. The only way to get it back is to open the file with an editor that supports conflict resolution.1 Once moved out of iCloud Drive, even that won’t help. The content is lost.2 Masking version conflicts might appear user-friendly, but it has catastrophic consequences. You might not discover the data loss until years later, when reopening significant but infrequently used documents. Until iCloud Drive exposes version conflicts in the file system or a central, easily accessible location, my strong recommendation is to move all crucial data out of it. Meanwhile, set up a Git repository to monitor your critical files; you might uncover surprising changes. I use iA Writer. ↩︎ In my tests, moving the unchanged file back to iCloud brought back the conflicted version popup. This may not happen if the file has been edited or if you’ve continued working on a copy. ↩︎ september 23, 2023 · apple icloud productivity products Related Privacy at Apple Playtesting at Valve How Tech Companies Manipulate the Media ← The Best Productivity Apps for Mac Latest Posts ICloud Drive Silently Deletes Your Content Playtesting at Valve Zettelkasten Latest Topics ABBA Alibaba Apple Books Cal Newport China Entertainment Finance Games Haruki Murakami Health ICloud Jack Ma Lovelife Marketing Mikhail Gorbachev Music Obsidian Personal Knowledge Management Russia Shanghai Skyscrapers USSR War Xi Jinping Colophon · Privacy Made with 🐨",

What did you do?\"- I break out in a cold sweat- I remember we had an iPad that also had the sync&#x27;ed Notes app- I open that up and immediately turn off WiFi to \"save\" the Notes- We call Apple- The support person ended up figuring out that we could essentially copy and paste each Note to a new folder so they wouldn&#x27;t be wiped out.It was a stressful couple hours though while we worked through it. I would also say that Apple could have given some more warning&#x2F;pop ups of the full impact of this.PS I also learned that Apple techs can essentially \"VNC\" into your phone and view things, change settings etc. They ask for permission and I think I may have had to hit \"approve\" but this is a feature I didn&#x27;t even think about it till I saw it in action. reply tredre3 16 hours agoparentNot excusing the footgun but I&#x27;m honestly amazed you could get an Apple rep to help you with notes syncing, let alone recover them. And they helped even if it seems like it was your own fault!My employer pays (a lot) for Google products and even then there&#x27;s no way they would ever help with that, let alone on the phone.In the past I did get a rep on the phone to help with things like access control but I can already hear her tell me (politely) to get lost if I needed help with Keep notes disappearing (which they occasionally do!). reply tmpX7dMeXU 11 hours agorootparentIt shouldn’t be surprising that Apple’s support is way better than Google’s. Apple’s support is above-average, and Google’s support; even for paying customers, is a regular punchline. reply Gud 6 hours agorootparentobviously Apples support is better than Googles but it can still be crap.My girlfriend lost an AirPod a couple of months ago, so we went to an Apple Store for replacement. Turns out the case was a Gen 1 case and the AirPod itself was a Gen 2. They had given her a gen 1 AirPod and it wouldn’t sync with the other one.We went back and the geniuses explained there was nothing they could do. The day after, I called Apple support and the guy almost started yelling at me, how it was our fault for mixing up the cases etc. Eventually he hung up on me.I called them back two hours later, explained again what had happened (including the previous phone call). She told me she would call the store and apologized for her colleague.In the end we ended up getting a refund for the wrong AirPod(but got to keep it) and had to buy new ones.So Apple support, not always great. reply meibo 13 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what you&#x27;re talking about, if you pay Google for support you get support.Workspace support is good in my experience, we interact every 2-3 weeks and they can usually resolve our issues or know when to escalate. You can call or chat. I know that you can also get phone support as a consumer now via Google One, but I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet personally. reply concinds 18 hours agoparentprevIf you did what I&#x27;m thinking of, you could have just turned sync back on and all the notes would have reappeared. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentYup. But the maddening part is that this is never made clear in any of the messaging.You get a message like \"all notes will be removed from this device\", but without any kind of reassurance that \"all 172 are still present in iCloud\".And if you&#x27;re not an expert in this, it&#x27;s a huge risk to take. When does deleting something synced locally leave it in the cloud, and when does deleting something synced locally also delete it from the cloud? This is one of the biggest and most dangerous UX confusions that exists right now, not specifially with Apple but all around. reply laurels-marts 17 hours agorootparentprevThis. Turning sync off shouldn&#x27;t delete notes from iCloud. It just doesn&#x27;t sync the notes from iCloud to the specific device in question so they are not visible from that device. To confirm OP could have logged in icloud.com from browser and seen the notes there. Then you can decide on a per-device basis whether you want to sync notes and have them be visible on that specific device. reply amelius 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat if you wanted to really delete the notes from Apple&#x27;s servers? reply ashildr 16 hours agoparentprevIIRC turning off sync asks you this question: “Are you sure you want to continue?

Apple hides sensitive inputs in regular screen sharing as well, and occasionally when airplaying to a TV, for PIN codes for instance. It sometimes makes it difficult to provide remote help to novice family members, because you have to guess what they’re seeing. reply chatmasta 17 hours agoparentprevHm, any details on that \"VNC\" functionality?

But it&#x27;s not even just iCloud -- it&#x27;s something fundamental to so much Apple software.The same thing happens to me repeatedly when I&#x27;m highlighting PDF&#x27;s using Books -- every so often, I go back to a PDF and discover multiple pages of my most recent highlights are missing. It saves highlights as you go along, but sometimes for whatever mystery reason, it decides that the version of your PDF from 11:35 is the newest main one, not the one from 11:45.These problems, of Apple silently overwriting newer content with an older version, have been going on for at least a decade at this point.And I just don&#x27;t understand how such a fatal flaw was ever built into the system in the first place, and how it still hasn&#x27;t been fixed. reply ben_w 18 hours agoparent> And I just don&#x27;t understand how such a fatal flaw was ever built into the system in the first place, and how it still hasn&#x27;t been fixed.Because the two hardest problems in software are cache invalidation, naming things, off by one errors, and buffer overflows from a lack of array index enforcement. reply navigate8310 18 hours agorootparentSurely a company stuffed with billions of dollars is incapable of solving this either by enabling conflict handling or some ingenious methods. reply tim333 20 minutes agorootparentIndeed it&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t better solutions out there as shown by dropbox.

I have used Apple computers on and off over the years, most recently from 2015- earlier this year. I think you are on to something re: philosophy. On the hardware side I remember when they did away with floppy disks (I&#x27;m getting old), optical drives, whole cpu architectures (3x!), etc. They do cut pretty brutally, and I guess when it comes to iCloud this seemingly extends to your files.I&#x27;m not going to say its all bad, but it is less and less my style (the older I get, especially). reply user_7832 16 hours agorootparentThe other thing about Apple&#x27;s software is that it neither fails gracefully nor does it warn the user. They give an appearance of \"everything is fine\" even when it isn&#x27;t.

That&#x27;s my point -- it&#x27;s not just an iCloud thing, it&#x27;s a local thing too.(And I long ago turned off iCloud for Books hoping it would fix the problem, but it didn&#x27;t. Which makes me suspect it&#x27;s some kind of \"local mode\" for iCloud that&#x27;s still open to these bugs.) reply camel_gopher 16 hours agoparentprevMost of their iCloud infra is built on instances of Cassandra.

But be warned git doesn’t work well with iCloud Drive. I used to have hundreds of git repositories in my iCloud Drive. Periodically, doing a big commit would trigger my whole multi-hundred gigabyte iCloud Drive to resync with Apple’s servers. This would take a day to complete. I went through Apple support up to quite a high level to try to resolve it and they never did. Now I keep my git repositories outside of iCloud Drive. The trigger seems to be if you ever change hundreds of files at the same time in quick succession before the last set of big changes finished syncing. reply laurels-marts 17 hours agoparentI thought it was common knowledge that you shouldn&#x27;t mix git (and similar VCS) with cloud drives and their cloud based version control (iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive etc.). The two don&#x27;t mix well and there&#x27;s room for all sorts of weird and unexpected behaviours especially if you have multiple devices synced to the same cloud drive. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentYup, you definitely shouldn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s common knowledge so much as some git operation will start failing after the fifth commit, so you figure it out pretty quick.I do have to say, I&#x27;ve never understood why git doesn&#x27;t work well with cloud drives. File management seems like a straightforward enough set of operations that ought to be bulletproof. I&#x27;ve never understood what precise operation gets corrupted when using git, and how that&#x27;s possible at all.And I don&#x27;t know if the fault is the cloud or git. Is it that the cloud returns errors 0.5% of the time, and git silently ignores those instead of retrying, and corrupts data? Or is it something about git reading and writing so many files so quickly that operations on the cloud drive somehow get lost or out of order but without generating errors? Both seem equally implausible, and yet... reply jquast 9 hours agorootparentI think it’s because git provides atomicy, requires it, requires you to make decisions on merge conflicts, etc while cloud sync makes invisible arbitrary decision of which file is newer, if there is a “conflict” like the same filename but different hashes and sizes, it will happily “clobber” your git database records by arbitrarily choosing which file is “better” reply dpc_01234 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m using syncthing to keep bare repos of my git dotfiles and alikes. Never any issues. reply JeremyNT 10 hours agorootparentI do the same.I think the golden rule here is to only work directly with the repo on a single device. Otherwise there is a lot of useless churn and more potential for conflicts.If you want to work with it on multiple devices, you can still sync it around, just work with a new clone of that repo rather than modifying it directly from multiple places. Then push your changes into the synced repo and act like it&#x27;s really remote instead of local.This does use more storage, however. reply dominikmayer 18 hours agoparentprevHi, original author here. Thanks for sharing.My problem is, that I need to use iCloud Drive for some important files because the app I need to use doesn&#x27;t support another way to sync.Without git I wouldn&#x27;t have figured out which files have changed. (And even with git, I can&#x27;t be sure that I caught everything. I guess git content can also be altered by iCloud sync conflicts…) reply eviks 18 hours agorootparentyou might store the git repo on a Dropbox folder (not a good idea in general, afaik clouds aren&#x27;t reliable enough for git, but as a backup), this way git content can&#x27;t be corrupted by iCloud?Or maybe even locally if you don&#x27;t need to commit on other computers, then you&#x27;ll be certain that git is correct without any cloud intervention reply dominikmayer 18 hours agorootparentCan I store the hidden git folder outside of the repo content? Not sure how to say.My problem is, that for the time being, some of my files needs to be on iCloud Drive because I rely on one app to edit&#x2F;create them.

Also, other version control systems make no assumptions about the underlying data, except when diffing and merging. People want and need this, and it seems reasonable. reply throwaway290 13 hours agorootparent> other version control systems make no assumptions about the underlying dataI most definitely used Git with binary data without any issues. It makes no assumptions as far as I can tell. It&#x27;s just not great with very large binaries.I think you cannot make a completely generic indifferent system in finite time. Maybe your system is optimized to efficiently work with 5 1TB files, or 1 million 5KB files, or just nicely handles a reasonable amount of text files in a neat way while being not extremely complex or hard to maintain & deploy.If Git does version control better than other control systems but only does it for text then I might be fine with that, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to have a scope. reply banana_giraffe 17 hours agoparentprevFor what it&#x27;s worth, git also can fail in some pretty bizarre ways in Dropbox for much the same reasons.

However it&#x27;s free&#x2F;inexpensive to use a service like GitHub&#x2F;GitLab&#x2F;Stash to save your work remotely. reply sneak 18 hours agoprevA much better reason to not use iCloud Drive is due to the fact that it&#x27;s not end to end encrypted. Everything you store in it is readable by Apple sysadmins, support reps, and anyone who can compel them (like the US government can, without a warrant now).Don&#x27;t use non-e2ee services.(Yes, there is an opt-in e2ee for iCloud now. No, nobody is using it because it is off by default and buried in settings.)I use syncthing (e2ee, free software) to keep my files on all my machines. It has sane conflict handling and nice versioning backups.

I can&#x27;t easily convince my friends and family to go through the effort of installing syncthing on multiple devices and then go through with the configuration of them.It&#x27;s great you&#x27;re a syncthing advocate, but telling people that icloud drive is bad just because they don&#x27;t enable a setting that could cause an average user to lose all of their data if they lose the key is a little ridiculous.

This is the reason Apple Books, Numbers and all the apps that use iCloud Drive remove local copies all the time.I made a simple note-taking app using iCloud Drive - iCloud was greedily removing a 2 kb txt-file when the app was closed (sometimes it wasn&#x27;t removing - it&#x27;s quite random). It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have a lot of storage space - iCloud still can remove the local version of a file you constantly use.The Apple developer support said nothing can be done.

The thing is: It&#x27;s independent of the editor. Even if you use an editor that _does_ support conflict handling you can lose the content.Just assume you write something, save, close the editor and never open it again. iCloud might replace the content of that file and there is no way for you to know.The only way to prevent losing your data is setting up a Git repository or open _every important file_ regularly in an editor that supports conflict handling. reply Wowfunhappy 18 hours agorootparentAh, thank you!

Endless frustration. Messages on my devices do not properly offload, syncing is broken to the point messages are missing, and stuff like search&#x2F;attachments just break sometimes. I&#x27;ve waited at least two major OS updates and nothing&#x27;s improved. You think they&#x27;d focus on such a core functionality.Sure, I have 126GB &#x27;in the cloud&#x27; apparently, but come on. The only fix I could see was to start fresh: so I set up a fresh Messages app on macOS, left it to sync overnight with the screen on until the \"Downloading messages from iCloud banner\" went away and made sure the important conversations showed \"0 images in iCloud\".I then exported what I could via unofficial tools but I still feel like I&#x27;ve lost data, which is painful for me. Such as, searching my earliest known message via another backup showed it in the search results on macOS, but clicking on it showed nothing but a blank conversation. It wasn&#x27;t even in Messages&#x27; SQLite DB after multiple \"Sync Now\"s and restarts. How the heck did it get that bad? Are the PMs at Apple just that misaligned?I finally tried deleting the most problematic conversation, which went \"ok\" on the Mac at first, but caused the apps on my iPhone and iPad to do nothing but crash on open. When the Mac synced next, the conversation reappeared with our past messages, but with random gaps in the history (e.g. messages from yesterday, then a week ago, maybe a month before that, etc -- so a incomplete&#x2F;weirdly ordered deletion). What a bloody mess. I ended up doing a \"Disable & Delete\" on iCloud Messages. Now I have to wait the the 30 day waiting period for Apple&#x27;s systems to wipe hopefully wipe the data in that bucket if I feel like trying again. All this certainly does not give me confidence in using iMessage (even with Messages in iCloud turned off) in the future.------I&#x27;m just.... very very frustrated. How can they take the most precious of their users&#x27; data and give no fucks about it? The same thing with \"shared photo albums\" where it&#x27;s not (or wasn&#x27;t) immediately obvious that they re-compress all images and videos to much lower quality because I guess they didn&#x27;t feel like deciding whose iCloud storage it would take up. So now my friend and I have photos and videos that are irrevocably, unless we go digging and find the originals we hopefully have elsewhere, compressed.And now iCloud Drive as in the article? A team needs to be formed at Apple to have a long hard look at how they&#x27;re handling their users&#x27; data and ensure it&#x27;s done with the utmost of care. This should be a wakeup call to other companies as well. Users are entrusting you with their live&#x27;s precious moments, or even their worst of times that may need to or want to be recalled upon later and you should be a good steward of that data. In the case of Apple, at least provide a reliable way to backup or export data such as Messages in iCloud, then perhaps I&#x27;d have a bit more than my many wasted hours fighting with your software and hoping that I have everything.\"Move fast and break things\" really was a terrible mantra. reply threeseed 17 hours agoparent> When the Mac synced next, the conversation reappeared with random messages in itAre you saying that you saw other people&#x27;s messages ?Because this would be one of the worst security issues in history if it were the case. reply ehPReth 17 hours agorootparentSorry, I tried to edit my post to clarify that better.

It was like a chosen few messages survived, and waiting longer didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on them disappearing.I&#x27;m sad I had to delete the conversation, but this wasn&#x27;t the first time I was sent an image or something and it.. just wouldn&#x27;t be there on a device and there was no way to make it download. So it seemed something was corrupt, or misbehaving.(As an aside while trying to sort everything out over the past day or so, a message from someone else was only on my iPad afterwards (it disappeared from my Mac and iPhone), and toggling sync did not cause it to propagate anywhere..) reply ClumsyPilot 17 hours agoparentprev> When the Mac synced next, the conversation reappeared with random messages in itNow consider that courts will use this evidence in case of a crime being suspected. And they will presume Apple’s backups to be more reliable source of information that anything you can produce.In Britain this happened, we sent over 500 people to prison for stealing money, but it turned out the IT system was bug ridden and didn’t sync transactions properly.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;British_Post_Office_scandal reply ehPReth 17 hours agorootparentHoly crap that&#x27;s terrifying!

Maybe I&#x27;m weird but for 20+ years I always used network shares for backups, or sharing of data. Never to store my live work, that&#x27;s always on my local disk. Why else have a local disk?People put way too much trust in these computers. It feels like we&#x27;re learning the same lessons over and over again. If you had to put your trust in 1) your local disk, or 2) a cloud service, then local disk always wins. Common sense. reply frenchman99 17 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s not at all common sense. People that use multiple devices may want to put everything in the cloud service so as to access the same version on all devices. reply INTPenis 5 hours agorootparentYes, I call that sharing. You&#x27;re going about it the wrong way, putting your live work on a network share instead of copying your finished work to a network share when you want to share it.Syncthing is also a good option but people have mixed experiences with that. reply LoganDark 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is what Syncthing is for: everything stays on your local file system, but different local file systems are kept in sync. reply runjake 17 hours agorootparentPlot twist: I get far more sync conflicts with SyncThing than I do with iCloud Drive.Granted, I’m using SyncThing between 3 different OS platforms. reply LoganDark 17 hours agorootparentSyncthing has pretty basic conflict resolution and depends on the devices being online at the time of the conflict, so that&#x27;s expected. It does, however, keep everything on the file system, and even allow you to move files to a trash rather than completely deleting them if they&#x27;re deleted on another device. Hasn&#x27;t saved my ass yet but maybe one day it will. reply Zambyte 17 hours agorootparentprevMalware built into iOS makes it impossible to install Syncthing[0], which is a problem for most of the people who use iCloud tp sync their files.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syncthing&#x2F;syncthing&#x2F;issues&#x2F;102 reply refulgentis 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m confused by the doubling down here, the bigs all sell cloud storage for precisely this use case. Syncthing might certainly well be better, but I&#x27;ve never heard of it, and billions have heard of iCloud.It&#x27;s besides the point: it&#x27;s certainly not indicative of whether or not it&#x27;s common sense that iCloud intends to sync documents. reply LoganDark 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not really doubling down on anything. I personally used Syncthing to keep two computers in sync while I was transitioning to a new one. Paying for cloud storage would have been unnecessary in my case. I did have iCloud before that, but I can&#x27;t access that anymore ever since my Mac broke.I do pay for cloud storage to sync my reMarkable 2, mostly because they&#x27;ll void my warranty if I don&#x27;t. reply GeekyBear 17 hours agorootparentprev> People that use multiple devices may want to put everything in the cloudThose people may learn the hard way that deleting documents on one device syncs that deletion to other devices in the same way that making changes to a document on one device syncs the changes to other devices. reply jtriangle 17 hours agoparentprevLocal disks fail, and backups suck to restore, it takes time, and it&#x27;s time you never planned on spending at the moment.Buy&#x2F;build a NAS, fill it with SSD&#x27;s, run raid10, run fast networking, and then back the NAS up to the cloud, use the NAS for hot data. That way, when a drive fails, you swap in a new one, and forget about it, no downtime, no BS.If your choice is between cloud and local disk, you&#x27;ve already failed. reply RajT88 17 hours agorootparentRaid 1 is probably enough for most if you are backing up to cloud. reply jtriangle 16 hours agorootparentTrue, but it&#x27;s also not as reliable on SSD&#x27;s as people think, because they will tend to run out of write endurance nearly simultaneously. Still protects you from actual failures, which is nice, but, far from bulletproof.Not as much of an issue with HDD&#x27;s, but, you also need many HDD&#x27;s to achieve the real world performance of even a single SSD and that gets expensive in terms of drive cost and power usage. reply RajT88 15 hours agorootparentFor my setup I use HDD&#x27;s. I am rarely dumping huge amounts of data which needs to go in a hurry. My network is 1gbit which is slower than SATA 2 anyways.I guess YMMV based on how fancy a setup you need. reply iterminate 17 hours agoparentprevDevices are just an interface for a lot of people, they might use dozens of devices during the period we (nerds) own a single computer. From borrowing their friends tablet, to changing their phone, to using a computer at a library or their office, they don&#x27;t have a stable local disk. The cloud is far more stable. reply fifteen1506 17 hours agoparentprevI agree with you but we seem old men screaming at the clouds.Let&#x27;s meet halfway: use rclone sync to get the cloud up to date with your local data.And, when out of alpha, you can also use rclone bisync. reply Gwypaas 17 hours agorootparentOr Dropbox and choose \"online only\".For my off site backup I have a computer which syncs everything to local storage. I guess I don&#x27;t defend against malicious intent or \"delete it all\" software bugs but that tends to end up as en exercise in insanity. reply fifteen1506 17 hours agorootparentStoring directly on Dropbox is 5x time slower than on &#x27;normal&#x27; filessystem. reply Gwypaas 17 hours agorootparentWhich is why I treat my computer as a thin client unless it is in the Dropbox folder.For example, every single line of code is simply a scratchpad if I don&#x27;t sync it to a remote git instance. reply ryanmcbride 17 hours agoparentprevMy mom is 70 and for as long as the app comes loaded on her phone, she&#x27;ll never learn this lesson. She doesn&#x27;t even begin to have enough understanding about stuff like this to be skeptical about it. There have to be protections in place for her, and people like her who are likely to believe anything a company claims without ever reading the fine print. reply PascLeRasc 17 hours agoparentprevYour advice is valid if you are an employee at a cloud service.

For many years, he collected recordings of live music shows. They were rare if not entirely transient (in that it would be impossible to reacquire them if lost), and he had a good library of them. Stored on his iMac. Then (as he tells the story) one day iTunes decided to replace all of his rare recordings with the equivalent studio songs.

With just a few clicks, any user with a github account can share their visual studio desktop on the web. VS code tunnel is almost considered a lolbin (Living Of the Land Binary). I am so glad that my users now have the ability to expose their computer with highly sensitive data right on the web, through an authentication I nor control, nor supervise. My internal network is now accessible from anywhere ! The worse part is that this tunnel can be triggered from the cmdline with the portable version of code.exe. An attacker just has to upload the binary, which won't be detected by any anti-virus since it is legitimate and singed windows binary. It is therefore something to watch out for. Execute it, open the link mentioned, log in to your github account and there is your reverse shell. .\\code.exe tunnel * * Visual Studio Code Server * * By using the software, you agree to * the Visual Studio Code Server License Terms (https://aka.ms/vscode-server-license) and * the Microsoft Privacy Statement (https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement). * Open this link in your browser https://vscode.dev/tunnel/sauceTomate/C:/Users/ipfyx/Downloads/vscode_cli_win32_x64_cli POWERSHELL The binary is definitely signed : Get-AppLockerFileInformation 'C:\\Users\\ipfyx\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\bin\\code-tunnel.exe'|Select-Object -ExpandProperty Publisher PublisherName : O=MICROSOFT CORPORATION, L=REDMOND, S=WASHINGTON, C=US ProductName : BinaryName : BinaryVersion : 0.0.0.0 HasPublisherName : True HasProductName : False HasBinaryName : False POWERSHELL Notice how there are nor ProductName nor BinaryName value, we will use them later. pfiatde blog post already did a great job at describing what an attacker can do so I won't say much more. Go check his awesome blog post. Mitigation But now, as a defender, how do we block or detect its usage ? Domains blacklist Microsoft documentation states : If you're part of an organization who wants to control access to Remote Tunnels, you can do so by allowing or denying access to the domain global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com. Yeah it's not that simple. It will indeed block most users but, from my testing, it won't block an attacker that has already established a tunnel once. Meaning the tunnel can be kept active or restarted at will despite this domain being blacklisted. From my understanding, VScode contacts global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com to get its \"clusters\" : https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters Here is a sample of the resulting json : [ { \"clusterId\": \"auc1\", \"uri\": \"https://auc1.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com\", \"azureLocation\": \"AustraliaCentral\" }, { \"clusterId\": \"aue\", \"uri\": \"https://aue.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com\", \"azureLocation\": \"AustraliaEast\" }, etc. ] ... JSON Those domains are also mentioned in another Microsoft documentation : - Dev Tunnels - global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com - [clusterId].rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com - [clusterId]-data.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com - *.[clusterId].devtunnels.ms - *.devtunnels.ms Blocking those domains will block and cut off any VS code tunnel : *.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com *.devtunnels.ms Applocker Applocker is Microsoft application whitelisting technology. When enabled and configured, with default rules for example, everything is blocked by default except for the executables and scripts defined in the preceding rules. Let's pretend we use Microsoft default rules for demo purpose. To generate them, in Group Policy Management Editor, go to Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Application Control Policies -> AppLocker. Right Click on Create Default Rules. Then right click on AppLocker and Export Policy. Figure 1: MS Applocker default rules generation Here is the resulting xml :... XML When using those rules, everything that is in Program Files and Windows is allowed, everything else is blocked. Administrators are allowed to execute anything, VSCode for instance. But if you were to define a rule that blocks VSCode, this rule would apply first, since \"Deny rules\" are applied before \"Allowed rules\". Let's build a rule to block VScode altogether. The rule applies to Everyone (SID S-1-1-0), therefore to Administrators (SID S-1-5-32-544). Get-AppLockerFileInformation 'C:\\Users\\ipfyx\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe'| New-AppLockerPolicy -RuleType Publisher -User S-1-1-0 -Optimize -Xml POWERSHELL In the resulting xml, I replaced Action=\"Allow\" with Action=\"Deny\".

Imported alone, this rule will completely block your system. Add a Allow * rule beforehand. ... XML Included in MS default rules, here is the resulting xml (called vscode.xml from now on) :...

If no rules matches, the default behaviour for applocker is to deny any execution. Code-tunnel is denied there, but it would not be if it was placed in the allowed directories. It could be placed there by an attacker or by a legitimate vscode, installed by an admin. A solution could be to use a Hash Condition. # Export Get-AppLockerFileInformation .\\code.exeNew-AppLockerPolicy -RuleType Hash -User S-1-1-0 -Optimize -Xml > .\\vscode-tunnel-hash.xml # Code tunnel is blocked Test-AppLockerPolicy -XmlPolicy .\\vscode-tunnel-hash.xml -Path 'C:\\Users\\ipfyx\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\bin\\code-tunnel.exe' -User S-1-1-0|fl FilePath : C:\\Users\\ipfyx\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\bin\\code-tunnel.exe PolicyDecision : Denied MatchingRule : code.exe POWERSHELL Warning : Do not import the following xml in Applocker.

So, as mentioned by other commenters, this does sound a lot like Raymond Chen&#x27;s airtight hatchway [1].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;badoption.eu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;31&#x2F;code_c2.html[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;oldnewthing&#x2F;20060508-22&#x2F;?p=31... reply xg15 21 hours agoparentI think there is a difference in degree.There is some likelihood that VS Code may already be installed (depending on who the attacker wants to target), so the victim \"just\" has to be tricked to run a single shell command - and the attacker immediately gets live shell access, without having to worry about firewalls, connectivity, finding the victim&#x27;s address, etc.So I think the danger of this is less that it&#x27;s technically an RCE exploit (as indeed you already need an existing way to run code to trigger it) - but rather that it lets an attacker turn a relatively simple capability (planting a single shell command with no back channel that the victim might run at some point in the future) into a sophisticated one (having access to a full remote shell with all bells and whistles, including firewall traversal, automatic reconnect and file transfer).Edit: ok, looks like the attacker already needs a back channel to get hold of the access code for the tunnel. reply mthomasmw 19 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ve misunderstood the situation completely. The first job of a persistent attacker is to gain acceess. The second job of a persistent attacker is to pivot that access from illegitimate to legitimate, so that by the time their TTPs become IOCs, log rotation has wiped that illegitimate access from the books and all their access looks legitimate.What we have here is a way for an attacker using shady means (email-delivered 0day, parking lot thumbdrive, browser drive-by compromise) to take over a computer and then drop a signed package that will allow for remote control over time that looks completely legitimate. To a network IDS, that access will look like an authorized cloud tunnel, completely normal. To a file scanner, it will look like an vendor-signed binary, the gold standard. To the complete defense-in-depth stack, the entire c2 chain is cloaked in legitimacy. If you get a single detection at all for the initial compromise (not possible with 0day), the entire rest of the kill chain looks like legitimate access and vanishes.It&#x27;s a nightmare for defense in depth and hunt teams. reply xg15 14 hours agorootparentThanks for the explanation, that makes a lot more sense actually. reply asmor 20 hours agorootparentprevssh.exe seems to be on enough Windows machines these days.

This whole post is a nothingburger since the \"attack\" requires the attacker to already be on the wrong side of the airtight hatchway. reply dundarious 21 hours agorootparentThe \"airtight hatchway\" argument is that it&#x27;s not a security bug in the program. I don&#x27;t think TFA makes the case that it is a security bug, so it&#x27;s moot.Personally I&#x27;m not particularly moved by the lolbin and footgun case it does make.

Effectively, the airtight hatchway often isn&#x27;t, so you do have to think about cases where the attacker is behind it.E.g., it used to be an effective security measure to have a daemon listen on loopback only. But then browsers relaxed the same-origin policy and today every sleazy banner ad can get the browser to open a TCP connection on loopback and at least send a TLS handshake - and, if the daemon accepts that, an OPTIONS request with an attacker-controlled URL. So a daemon has to perform at least some basic validation on incoming connections to be secure. reply plorkyeran 19 hours agorootparentZero-trust networking still involves threat models and things which you are and aren&#x27;t trying to defend against. The \"airtight hatchway\" concept is just that once you&#x27;ve declared that a certain type of attack isn&#x27;t something you&#x27;re trying to prevent, there&#x27;s no point in reporting issues which rely on that attack because it&#x27;s already known to be vulnerable. Defense in depth can be seen as adding multiple hatchways, but there&#x27;s still always going to be something inside the innermost one.If your threat model involves people trying to exfiltrate data from a developer machine with an internet connection in an innocent-looking way, this VSC feature is a problem. Most companies either don&#x27;t make an attempt at preventing that, or would use an airgapped setup so it&#x27;s not something worth caring about. reply Dylan16807 18 hours agorootparent> Defense in depth can be seen as adding multiple hatchways, but there&#x27;s still always going to be something inside the innermost one.And even if you&#x27;re not in the innermost area, an attack might exist entirely in the space between two hatchways and not breach any. reply josephcsible 6 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t this validly described as \"it lets you execute commands as a particular user on a particular host, but requires you to first execute a command as that user on that host\"? Even in \"defense in depth\" or \"zero-trust networking\" paradigms, what does this ever let attackers do that they couldn&#x27;t do already? reply mac-chaffee 18 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately, differentiating good behavior from malicious behavior is a central pillar of security, and the existence of this feature undermines that pillar.* The fact that it&#x27;s in a popular signed binary means it bypasses app allow-lists.* The fact that it flows through Microsoft&#x27;s servers bypasses firewall allow-lists.* The fact that no stage2 is required bypasses antivirus scanning.I say \"unfortunately\" because I personally think attempting to differentiate good behavior from malicious behavior is losing battle.

The question is what a vscode user could be tricked into doing. That part of the explanation could be fleshed out more?I&#x27;m also reminded of how browsers do defense in depth. The \"airtight hatch\" argument implies that second-level security is worthless because the first level is secure. Having a useful binary already there on the system might be useful for chaining with another exploit?But that assumes a developer environment can be made into a low-privilege container, sort of like a browser&#x27;s render process. I don&#x27;t think many people work that way?Perhaps someday we will work in containers and code editors will be locked down like browsers. The most straightforward path to that would probably be for the code editor to run in the browser.That&#x27;s something VS Code can do, so a policy that says you must use a browser-based version of VS Code might actually work for some organizations? reply t0mas88 8 hours agoparentThe \"airtight hatch\" story is not fully applicable here. Executing VScode instead of a random exploit payload could be considered an increase in privilege, because you&#x27;re going from an unsigned and unknown binary to one that is signed by Microsoft. And VScode is probably allowed through any outgoing firewall rules because the main user of the machine is using it, while a random exploit payload would not be. reply CalChris 20 hours agoprevThe vast vast majority of users will neither want nor use this embedded reverse shell functionality.

The slim minority who do want it and would use it can suffer the inordinate burden of having to go into the preferences panel and clicking enable.You can argue whether it is a hole (it is) or whether it is a piece of a hole (it is).

You don’t need to install any extension, `code tunnel` is builtin, the extension is UI stuff using the tunnel. No need for any extension to open a reverse shell.2. It’s about an attacker exploiting the feature, the attacker is enabling it and doing the login. Whether you need to enable it yourself is largely irrelevant, in fact you’re probably more likely to notice an ongoing attack if you use the feature yourself.Anyway, default is pointless, a gadget is a gadget as long as the bits are there and easily executable. reply CalChris 19 hours agorootparentprevBut I don&#x27;t want to know this feature in order to use this editor.

A really naive thing to do would be to run any shell (any program really) in its own isolated environment. The barriers to this aren’t really technical IMO, mostly they are UX barriers. It needs good OS support, and there’s not really a developer oriented OS with smooth mechanisms for escalating and de-escalating privileges at a granular level (sudo ain’t it lol).An ideal development environment would: (1) allow for executing unsigned&#x2F;self-signed code without jumping through hoops or relying on a 3rd party or App Store, (2) allow for escalation and automatic descalation of fine-grained privileges with native UX for grants (LittleSnitch on macOS has a good design for this specifically for networking IMO —- one could imagine extending this to the file system).There are plenty of systems that have some aspects of these, but I have not seen both, at least not in a form accessible enough to be ubiquitous in 2023. reply jeremyjh 16 hours agoparentprevOr someone with physical access for five minutes can set themselves with a lifetime subscription to whatever you may have thats worth stealing on that machine in the future, without installing anything that can be detected as malware. reply nikanj 19 hours agoparentprevCode execution leads to code execution.

A place I worked forked VSCode as it&#x27;s recommended IDE. VSCode can prevent installation of all but allowlisted extensions by policy.

Surely there&#x27;s a better way to reduce the effort involved.Yeah, it’s called LSP. The core of most plugins is just an lsp that’s shared between vim, neovim, emacs, vscode, sublime, etc. all the editor needs is to support generic lsp, or have a generic lsp plugin like vim&#x2F;emacs.For example if you look at neovim, you just load the actual lsp and wire it up to the editor in lua.

    "title": "Bottlerocket – Minimal, immutable Linux OS with verified boot",
    "originLink": "https://bottlerocket.dev",
    "originBody": "Bottlerocket FAQ Documentation Bottlerocket is a Linux-based operating system optimized for hosting containers. It’s free and open-source software, developed in the open on GitHub. Bottlerocket is installed as the base operating system on the machine or instance where your containers themselves are running. It is specifically designed to work with your container orchestrator (like Kubernetes) to automate the lifecycle of the containers running in your cluster. Bottlerocket runs in the cloud or in your datacenter. Bottlerocket has three primary goals: Minimal · Safe Updates · Security Focused. Get Started Orchestrated ClusterKubernetes or ECS Control Plane container container container container container Bottlerocket Bottlerocket container container container container container Bottlerocket container container container container container Data Plane Bottlerocket is an operating system for the worker nodes in an orchestrated container cluster. Minimal Hosting containers doesn’t require much from an operating system and hosting containers is all Bottlerocket aims to do. Many of the packages, tools, interpreters, and dependencies installed by default in general purpose Linux distributions are simply not needed to only host containers. By excluding these extraneous pieces of software, your operational and security overhead is reduced. Bottlerocket manages complexity and requirements for different orchestrators, platforms, and architectures into specific builds for every compatible combination called variants. This ensures that your operating system is tailor made for that set of requirements. bottlerocket-aws-k8s-1.27-aarch64-1.14 bottlerocket-aws-ecs-2-x86_64-1.15 bottlerocket-metal-k8s-1.28-x86_64-1.15 Platform Orchestrator Architecture BottlerocketVersion VMware vSphere AWS/EC2 Bare Metal Kubernetes 1.28 ECS x86_64 ARM/aarch64 1.15 1.14 1.13 ... ... ... ... ... ... Kubernetes 1.27 ... Bottlerocket variants assemble everything needed to run in a given environment. Pick the appropriate variant and nothing else is needed to join the cluster. Bottlerocket itself does not have a shell. It doesn’t need one. You can still interact with the system through privileged “host” containers (that do have shells). From host containers, you can explore the underlying operating system and even make changes to the running system’s settings via an API. Bottlerocket container container container container privileged hostcontainer shell You can totally login to a Bottlerocket node. The shell you’re logging into is actually in a container with privileged access to the resources of the underlying operating system. Safe Updates Bottlerocket is designed to be updatable but it doesn’t have a package manager. It doesn’t need one. Updates are delivered via an image that is downloaded to a specific partition. When you’re ready to update, let your orchestrator drain the node and then tell Bottlerocket to apply the update and reboot when ready. Bottlerocket will swap the partitions and boot with the new version atomically. Runningversion container container container container container Newversion Download Reboot Bottlerocket uses multiple partitions to manage updates. Changeover occurs atomically at reboot. Because system settings are accomplished through an API, Bottlerocket knows how to migrate these settings between versions. Should something go awry during an update, the Bottlerocket update system lets you revert to the previously working version with your settings intact. Bottlerocket updates can be managed manually or with the help of Bottlerocket’s orchestrator-specific tools: Bottlerocket Update Operator (brupop) and the ECS updater. Security Focused Being both minimal and updatable underlie important aspects of Bottlerocket’s focus on security. The use of variants delivered by an image means that there is no requirement for a package registry or manager that can mutate the system and introduce security issues. Bottlerocket’s unique functionality is written in Rust and a little bit of Golang. Both are compiled languages with built-in protection against memory safety issues. Additionally, since Bottlerocket is delivered via images with all code pre-compiled, shells and interpreters are not needed, closing an undesirable pathway for execution of unverified code. The root filesystem of Bottlerocket is immutable. dm-verity provides transparent integrity checking of the root filesystem and the kernel will restart if any changes to the underlying block device are detected. Additionally, Bottlerocket has an always-enabled, enforced, restrictive SELinux policy for the mutable filesystem that helps prevent containers from executing dangerous operations, even when running as root. ← immutable dm-verity mutable → SELinux ✔ Atomically replaceable✔ Cryptographically signed✔ Protected to block level✗ Alterable at run-time ✔ Persistency on per file basis✔ Protection on per file basis✔ Policies cannot be altered Bottlerocket Storage rootfs logs, images,configs Bottlerocket has many layers of protection against unintended changes to the system.

For example, you want vulnerability scanning on the OS? Well you can use an Amazon product for that, otherwise *shrug* [1]. So I guess as long as you plan to run Bottlerocket in AWS, you&#x27;re fine.I wish the Bottlerocket team would do 1 of 2 things. Either own up that this is just an AWS project, or start to solve for things like this and actually be a product that \"runs in the cloud or in your datacenter\" as they suggest on their website.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bottlerocket.dev&#x2F;en&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#4_2 reply xyzzy123 15 hours agoparentTo be fair, I think \"VM\" on the OS for Flatcar &#x2F; BottleRocket &#x2F; CoreOS is not a requirement in the same way as on RHEL etc.Do you want to know if you are patched? Are you running the latest version? If so, you have all the available patches.I appreciate this can cause difficulties in some regulated domains because there&#x27;s a \"vm\" box that needs to be ticked on the compliance worksheet.Most of the reason we need VM on a \"traditional\" OS is to handle the fact that they have a very broad configuration space and their software composition can be - and often is - pretty arbitrary (incorporating stuff from a ton of sources &#x2F; vendors and those versions can move independently).But that&#x27;s not how you&#x27;re supposed to use a container OS.If you do \"extra work\" to discover vulnerabilities in \"latest\", you are not really doing the job of a system owner (whose job is to apply patches from upstream in a timely fashion), you are doing the work of a security researcher. reply JustinGarrison 12 hours agoparentprevIf you’re interested in something not AWS check out Talos https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.talos.dev&#x2F;It’s been around longer than Bottlerocket reply insanitybit 17 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not like something is stopping one from doing a vuln scan, right? Like, there&#x27;s something that SSM&#x27;s in (or uses the admin container) and then runs the scan. Couldn&#x27;t you just do the same thing?Genuine questions, I don&#x27;t know if this is the case or not. reply stigz 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a good point. And it sounds like it would work to me as well. I don&#x27;t know the answer either.I guess my point is the project should be providing a clear path that doesn&#x27;t involve AWS instead of just stopping short. reply robszumski 11 hours agorootparentprevI just wrote a post on this.

It can be done before deploying the image to the host machines. reply capableweb 5 hours agorootparentIndeed, but it&#x27;s just an example. Imagine it said \"For example, you want Feature X on the OS? Well you can use an Amazon product for that, otherwise shrug\" instead if it makes it easier. reply ngrilly 5 hours agorootparentI missed it was just an example. That’s a fair concern otherwise. Thanks! reply jacurtis 16 hours agoprevBottlerocket does not off FIPS mode like most other enterprise *nix distributions.Just to save anybody the trouble who needs FIPS approved encryption for host OSes that you use at work for various compliance programs. This makes Bottlerocket a non-starter for us. A very active issue has been open for over 2 years on this and the dev teams don&#x27;t seem to be convinced that this is important. We even communicated with the dev team through our dedicated AWS reps and they have no interest in adding this.Here is the open 2+ year thread on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bottlerocket-os&#x2F;bottlerocket&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1667 reply bcressey 10 hours agoparentDisclosure: I work for Amazon. I’m also the principal engineer for Bottlerocket.FIPS support continues to be the top customer ask by a wide margin. Unfortunately the timing here is not kind for a new distro with no previous FIPS offering. New FIPS 140-2 certifications are no longer available, and new FIPS 140-3 certifications have to make it through a lengthy queue as the entire industry switches over.If this were something the dev team could just power through, I assure you it would have happened by now. I apologize for giving the impression that it’s not important. It is, but that doesn’t help the timeline in this case. reply hedora 15 hours agoparentprevIn my experience with FIPS certification usually requires some changes that undermine security.If you need it, then you need it, but having the certification is a mildly bad sign in my opinion.I’m not the only one with this opinion. For instance, the Microsoft Windows team seems to agree:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcommunity.microsoft.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;microsoft-security-ba... reply akyuu 15 hours agorootparentIn the GitHub issue, there is a mention of replacing rustls and Go&#x27;s crypto library with OpenSSL. That seems like a serious security downgrade. reply bandrami 1 hour agorootparentprevIt makes no sense if your goal is \"have the most secure system feasible under your resource constraints and usage requirements\", which is a reasonable goal.However, the whole FIPS and USG compliance in general mindset is not that; the goal instead is \"be aware of ways in which your system is known to not be secure\". The idea that a known flaw is better than an less-known fix is infuriating to devs, but from a business standpoint it makes some sense. reply throwing_away 15 hours agorootparentprevHaving been around a bunch of former-government people and bumping into FIPS myself a few times (like yubikeys) and reading about it, that&#x27;s also been my sense, but it&#x27;s nice to see a formal writeup with examples.Thanks for the link. reply evrimoztamur 17 hours agoprevThis looks very interesting but as other commenters pointed out, the path to running it yourself seems to be obscured.

Basically it goes like this. Terraform idempotent setup of VMs with immutable Linux server OS, running containers.We even disabled login on these in production, only keep it enabled in staging. All changes are tested in staging. If anything happens in prod, instead of logging in and making manual changes we just revert to an earlier state.There is less need to configure files and services on the OS when everything runs in a container.

About the only thing I know atm is that I can’t use ssh until a container is deployed. reply rezonant 10 hours agorootparentYes, its listed in the Community AMIs section. It&#x27;s more common to use this alongside Elastic Kubernetes or other similar AWS services though, where you can opt to use Bottlerocket at the host during configuration.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;bottlerocket&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;#Using_Bottlerocket reply Uehreka 9 hours agorootparentOK cool, thanks for that information, but I do wish that someone would explain the mechanism for deploying this OS. Like, if it’s part of an ECS&#x2F;EKS scheme I’ll tolerate some magic, but at the end of the day I’m a curious person and I’d like to know the mechanics behind how my software is getting deployed.

On the other hand, the number of times one of these images would be configured for a company is probably pretty small.I’ll have to spend a bit more time, but this seems like a nice option for orgs that want to run on-prem (e.g. not in cloud), and have a low maintenance container host. replyblintz 13 hours agoprevThis seems really useful for stuff like AMD SEV-SNP, where we want a measurement of the (kernel + initrd + arguments) to guarantee certain behavior from the machine. Ideally, we could use this as the container hypervisor, and have it produce attestations that bind to the hashes of the running containers. This relies on not having container escapes; not sure what the state of the art on that is right now. reply super_linear 17 hours agoprevIs anyone successfully using this outside of AWS? reply fyrn_ 14 hours agoparentJust one data point, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to work on hetzner cloud reply totallywrong 13 hours agoprevI&#x27;d much rather go with CoreOS. Is there anything they&#x27;ve open sourced widely used outside of AWS? reply garganzol 15 hours agoprevWebsite says that the OS does not have a shell. I cannot imagine a useful docker container without at least one shell script inside. So, if there is no shell, doesn&#x27;t it mean that Bottlerocket is generally unusable except niche scenarios? reply CGamesPlay 15 hours agoparentThe docker containers can have shell scripts inside. The host machine doesn&#x27;t have a shell. You can bring a docker container with a shell, and run it privileged, to have a shell on the host machine. reply perplexa 14 hours agorootparentYou can also launch an admin container and type `sudo sheltie` in it to get a root shell on the bottlerocket host OS if you need to debug things.We&#x27;ve been using Bottlerocket together with its update operator on K8s for about a year now and we are really happy with it as it solves patch management by swapping out an immutable host OS image instead. reply rezonant 11 hours agoparentprevContainers which contain shell scripts also contain the shell itself. It is not typical for the host machine&#x27;s shell binary to be made available to containers running on the host. reply jbnorth 14 hours agoparentprevThe idea with Bottlerocket is that the host itself does not have a direct shell nor a way to access it via SSH or any other method. Instead this responsibility is delegated to the admin container which is where you would actually connect to via SSM&#x2F;SSH. From here if you needed a root shell you would use the `sheltie` utility to do so. reply snowstormsun 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not uncommon to have docker containers without a shell for security reasons. For example distroless. reply seabrookmx 8 hours agorootparentOr scratch containers, which work fine if you have a tool chain that can easily do static linking (GoLang, rust, for example). reply ww520 13 hours agoparentprevHere&#x27;s a diagram on the subsystems.

SSH into the host whenever you need to see how things are performing.Kubernetes only works so long as you don&#x27;t really care about resources being used well. reply kmac_ 3 hours agoparentBecause Kubernetes is both abstraction and de facto standardized platform across infrastructure providers. All deployments to customers who are large institutions start with provisioning, OS alignment (there are huge differences between RHEL, SLES, Debian or Amazon, then customisations like hardenings are put on top), networking, storage, access rights. You don&#x27;t want to deal with that from scratch each time. It costs both time and money. Direct dealing with hardware is long gone (Hyper-V and VMware), and now it&#x27;s time to cut out the upper layers.

I work as an email hardening &#x2F; deliverability support engineer and our advice is always to focus on DKIM + DMARC, rather than SPF. You still need SPF for legacy reasons, but it should never be relied on for deliverability or anti-impersonation.Slide 54 says that DKIM + DMARC does not help against this attack, but that is not completely true.If (and only if) you have set up DKIM for all your delegated senders, then (and only then) can you safely enable a DMARC p=reject policy. Once you have reached that level, you can start opting out of SPF for third party senders, by using the &#x27;?&#x27; (neutral) modifier in SPF.So this: v=spf1 include:relay.mailchannels.net ~allBecomes this: v=spf1 ?include:relay.mailchannels.net ~allThis gives emails from MailChannels a neutral SPF stance with DMARC capable receivers, causing them to use DKIM instead. Old legacy email services should still accept neutral results as well.Granted, it is not a perfect solution, but email will never be 100% reliable, or secure anyway. reply lucb1e 10 minutes agoparentWhat&#x27;s wrong with SPF then? I&#x27;ve always wondered what advantage DKIM has over SPF, since source IP spoofing is rather tricky¹ with TCP. Until I got a new IP address with a mediocre reputation in June, I just put in SPF to allow $myIP only. Good luck sending spam in the name of my domain. Even for larger organisations which need to allowlist multiple senders, how would one spoof that in a situation where it is not also possible to spoof the DKIM records?¹ although not impossible, spoofing an entire mail exchange requires terabytes of traffic for one email of a few bytes, iff starttls is not enforced in which case it becomes impossible reply crtasm 13 hours agoprevVideo of the talk: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NwnT15q_PS8or here (video format didn&#x27;t work in firefox for me but VLC plays it): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defcon.org&#x2F;DEF%20CON%2031&#x2F;DEF%20CON%2031%20vid... reply Brybry 11 hours agoparentI think these might be the demos that were unable to play during the talk:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=61PIOBp30vAhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eODw4t4WaCw reply remram 49 minutes agoprevSince about September 1st, email forwarding from my Gmail account to another Gmail account fails with a DMARC-related bounce depending on the original sender&#x27;s configuration. Email security has become too hard for email providers to get right. reply promiseofbeans 12 hours agoprevWe use cloudflare workers + mailchannels in production. Yikes.We were already sorking on migrating away from cf workers to real servers, and now also we&#x27;ll also have to move away from mailchannels I guess.Security risks aren&#x27;t worth the convenience. reply ttul 11 hours agoparentNote that since June 2023, it is impossible to send email from Workers through MailChannels unless you publish a _mailchannels record in your DNS. reply pevey 1 hour agorootparentThis doesn’t seem like a real fix for the issue. This brings the number of spoofable sites way down from all MC users to just those who send mail through CF. But it is still a big vulnerability.For any domain that is using mailchannels through cloudflare, you can see what region they are using. And you can continue to spoof them. You just have to do it from the same region.And this is terrible positioning from Cloudflare’s POV. Why would anyone send email through a CF worker since it requires advertising through a public record (DNS) that is by design accessible&#x2F;scrapable by bots that you are using an insecure service. It’s like asking people to spoof you.I don’t get why CF doesn’t do something more sensible, like limit sender addresses to domains that are already set up in the cloudflare account where the worker was created. Basically every other provider does this. reply Thorrez 8 hours agorootparentprevSource?

The reason being one marketing company sets up Analytics. A few months later, a different company expects to be authorised to run another set, but all the admins get told is \"you have to add this record\". reply xorcist 3 hours agorootparentOr just allocate proper DNS records as the standard intended.There was a SPF record type in DNS, TXT was suggested as a transition, but we all know how that went.Incidentally, SPF is a good example how a large company hijacked the process and tried to stuff the standard with things they had taken out patents on. That made the end standard less useful than what it could have been. reply lathiat 7 hours agorootparentprevThey also generally don&#x27;t need to stay there it&#x27;s usually one-shot (at least the ones I&#x27;ve seen) but no one bothers to delete them. reply bandrami 2 hours agorootparentI give talks to IT teams on the importance of cleaning up transient auth records in DNS and, as the night follows the day, I don&#x27;t do it on my own personal ones. reply weird-eye-issue 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat would you have used? reply inetknght 4 hours agorootparentI would have implemented DKIM and SPF. reply weird-eye-issue 4 hours agorootparentGreat.

But you don’t know if these keys are active, or if they are meant to be activated later. Or there might be multiple authenticated senders for a domain name, and some might use DKIM signing, but others might not.1. Not all DNS servers obey the standards correctly, so the NXDOMAIN&#x2F;NOERROR distinction only mostly works. reply mike_d 12 hours agoparentIt is possible for providers who see a statically significant potion of mail traffic to see all or almost all DKIM selectors.I think what the line you quote is trying to say is reject mail from MailChannels that isn&#x27;t DKIM signed. reply teddyh 11 hours agorootparent> It is possible for providers who see a statically significant potion of mail traffic to see all or almost all DKIM selectors.Yes, but you can’t know that every authenticated sender is using DKIM at all. If the mail you just recieved from a new sender (even if it is from a domain which you have recieved DKIM signed mail from before) passes SPF but is not signed using DKIM, they are quite probably from a valid, albeit rarely used, mail sender who simply does not use DKIM.> I think what the line you quote is trying to say is reject mail from MailChannels that isn&#x27;t DKIM signed.No, they can’t be saying that, since elsewhere they say that only 105 out of 2 million MailChannel domains are using DKIM. Therefore, they can’t be reasonably suggesting to block all mail from all but 105 of these domains. reply ttul 11 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re pointing out the inherent challenge of domain authentication. Large domain owners like Google lock their domains down by publishing restrictive SPF records that do not authorize anyone other than their own IP space. For everyone else, SPF is a gigantic hole that you can drive a truck through.For this and other reasons, people who actually work in the email industry do not trust SPF when authenticating domains. An SPF pass is necessary but not sufficient to know that someone is responsible for the email you just received. A far more trustworthy element is a valid DKIM signature; this certifies that the domain owner signed the message contents with a key they presumably control themselves. reply teddyh 11 hours agorootparentThe logical way to fix this seems to me to be for DMARC to implement some way for the domain to not just require SPF or DKIM, but explicitly require DKIM specifically.This is how other similar things have solved similar problems, like DANE, CAA DNS records, and HSTS headers in HTTP.

Sadly things like Google Calendar invites still fail DKIM… reply ttul 11 hours agoparentThe next release of DMARC will likely include an option to exclude SPF from DMARC verification.

As someone who runs his own private mail server, I can seemingly improve the deliverability of my emails by just adding a set of useless ARC headers to my own emails? reply movedx 10 hours agoparentI want to say no, purely based on the idea that if that were the case all my inboxes - spreads across several providers - would be overwhelmed with spam?

Confirmed with ProtonMail. Seems to be the case with Gmail and Outlook as well.And it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s anything that would prevent me from adding this to my own emails. I don&#x27;t think it would turn blatant spam into non-spam, but it seems like it could help something that&#x27;s already teetering on the line. reply ttul 8 hours agoparentprevNobody in the email world considers ARC to be a bulletproof way to bypass spam filtering at a major receiver. The DEFCON presenter was ill-equipped to make that determination. reply bhaney 7 hours agorootparent> bulletproof way to bypass spam filteringYeah that&#x27;s definitely not what I meant or what the presenter seems to be implying. If it helps spam scores even a little bit, that&#x27;s very interesting and potentially worth implementing in private hosts that often get dinged by larger hosts just for not being well-known.

GET DIGITAL ACCESS COOKING Definitely Do Not Put Plastic in the Microwave Experts say even if it claims to be “microwave-safe.” BY ALI FRANCIS September 16, 2023 Getty/Gustavo Muñoz Soriano All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. In Too Afraid to Ask, we’re answering food-related questions that may or may not give you goosebumps. Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave? It all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, was studying silver nanoparticles released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits. As a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. “I’d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,” he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating? Quite possibly billions, according to his findings. To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids. Microwaving the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million microplastics (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain’s research indicates we’re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019 one study calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year. ADVERTISEMENT The health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And growing evidence suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues. Given the mounting concern around one of earth’s most-produced substances, Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave? What does microwaving do to plastic? Plastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil. To make plastics that are clear, cloudy, rigid, or soft, manufacturers add a cocktail of chemicals. Though there are more than 10,000 of them, the most well-studied groups are: bisphenols (which include BPA and are often found in rigid products, like food storage containers and water pipes) and phthalates (which are typically used to make more flexible products, such as food prep gloves or the plastic lining inside a milk carton). As Hussain found, microplastics and chemicals can build up in your leftovers over time—even when you’re storing those plastic containers in the fridge. But microwaving wet foods in plastic delivers an even bigger one-two punch: Heat speeds up hydrolysis, the process by which water molecules can essentially break chemical bonds apart. This supercharged reaction causes plastic containers to shed microplastics and nanoplastics, as well as leach chemical additives (the bisphenols, phthalates, and more), into your food. And once those microplastics are ingested, it’s possible they can degrade and also leach chemicals in the body. WATCH Priya Makes Pav Bhaji In other words, heating plastic essentially makes it softer and more porous. If you’ve ever microwaved marinara sauce in a plastic bowl, you’ve seen the sunset red, impossible-to-remove stain it leaves behind. “Passages in the plastic can open up, so the sauce gets inside,” says James Rogers, PhD the director of food safety research and testing at Consumer Reports. The opposite exchange happens too: “If something goes in, something can also come out,” he says. Are those chemicals and microplastics unsafe? Just about all Americans have measurable amounts of phthalates and BPA in their bodies. Mammalian animal studies strongly suggest that, once inside, these chemicals act like sneaky gatecrashers at a masquerade ball. They’re not welcome at the party, but they’re also tough to parse from the legitimate guests. That’s because bisphenols and phthalates are endocrine disruptors. They can mimic, block, or interfere with the body’s hormones—possibly increasing the risk of various conditions, including infertility, some cancers, metabolic diseases, neurological conditions, and immune system dysfunction. According to Laura N. Vandenberg, PhD, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, “That’s just the short list.” Various human studies have also reinforced the animal ones. Exposure to high phthalate levels in the womb has been linked to asthma in childhood. For boys, that early contact could cause behavioral problems as well as potentially lower sperm counts later in life. Pregnant people might experience lower thyroid hormone levels and more preterm births. There’s a lot more that we don’t know. At Duke University, Jason Somarelli, PhD, the director of research at the Duke Comparative Oncology Group, is studying the thousands of other additives in plastics. “We’ve found at least 100 known carcinogens in these other chemicals,” he says. “And then there’s well over 2,000 others where we just don’t have enough data to know.” What he can say with confidence: “There’s bad stuff in plastic.” Beyond the chemicals being leached by plastics, the particles themselves—which have been discovered in human hearts, bloodstreams, lungs, placentas, semen, and breastmilk—pose a threat too. The body sees the physical particles as intruders, so naturally they seem to fight back. That can trigger an immune response: Because plastics can’t be degraded, white blood cells die in the battle, causing inflammation. Those particles can also “act as transport vehicles for other pollutants,” says Vandenberg, bringing potentially toxic substances into the body. Hussain wanted to see for himself what microplastics and nanoplastics might do inside our bodies. His team bathed human embryonic kidney cells in high concentrations of plastics shed by the containers they were testing. Within 48 hours, 76% of embryonic kidney cells died—about three times more than the percentage of cells that spent the same amount of time in a more diluted (less plastic-y) solution. Hussain’s findings corroborate another study published last year, which determined that direct microplastic exposure can cause cell death, inflammation, and oxidative stress. So, why aren’t the cells in our bodies dying en masse? “The big outstanding question is uptake,” says Somarelli. “If these plastics just get in our guts and we flush most of them out—if we’re all just walking around pooping and peeing out plastic all the time—then they will have potentially little effect.” That’s what Hussain hopes is happening too: “I would like to believe that our body is working on getting them out,” he says. But even if these particles and chemicals aren’t making us sick immediately, most experts I spoke to suspect they could still have longer-term effects. But what if my container is “microwave-safe”? Though various plastics are marked as microwave-safe—and plenty of plastic lobbyists have defended them as perfectly safe—the term is somewhat misleading. It’s simply referring to plastic types that won’t crack or melt when heated, not their chemical makeup. Supposedly microwave-safe products can still contain bisphenols, phthalates, and plenty of other potentially harmful ingredients. All of the experts I spoke with suggest people avoid storing and heating food in plastics altogether. “Without testing the entire landscape of these products, it is hard to really know” if any of them are truly safe, says Rogers. Though some types are known to pose more health risks than others. So, how can you identify them? Most plastics will have a number (one through seven) stamped somewhere on the surface, usually on the underside of the container. The seven types include: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE): a semi-rigid plastic typically deployed as soda bottles, peanut butter jars, and clothing fibers. High density polyethylene (HDPE): the most commonly used plastic type. Find it in your detergent containers, milk jugs, and protein powder tubs. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): a versatile plastic (that may contain phthalates) used across industries, such as health care, construction, and fashion. Find it in plumbing pipes, shower curtains, medical blood bags, and synthetic leather. Low density polyethylene (LDPE): a super flexible, usually transparent plastic used to make shopping bags, cling wrap, and juice bottles. Polypropylene (PP): a tough, moldable type of plastic usually marketed as heat resistant or microwave safe. It’s used to make food storage containers, baby bottles, toys, and more. Polystyrene (PS): the usually-foamy type of lightweight plastic that can melt at high temperatures. Find it in some disposable food containers, packing peanuts, and the meat aisle of your local grocery store. Other: This mish-mash includes polycarbonate, polylactide, acrylic, acrylonitrile butadiene, styrene, fiberglass, and nylon. Plastics in this broad category may contain bisphenols and could include five-gallon water cooler jugs, some citrus juice and ketchup bottles, as well as produce clamshells. Rogers, who worked in food safety at the United States Department of Agriculture for more than a decade before joining Consumer Reports, says customers should always try to avoid plastics marked with a one or a six—those which are used to make the single-use Styrofoam food packaging that might contain your latest delivery order. These types of plastics usually have a low melting point, “which means that when you’re microwaving them, they’ll release chemicals even faster than harder plastics,” he says. Types three and seven are also the most likely categories to contain phthalates and bisphenols. If he “was on a deserted island and [plastic] was all that was available,” Rogers says he’d opt for types two and five. These are both higher density formulas, used to contain liquids and manufacture items like the rigid plastic forks dispensed at your local takeout restaurant. They have a higher melting point, “and they also don’t tend to chip or shatter as much,” says Rogers. (Still, Hussain’s team found these types of containers shed plenty of microplastics when heated.) Though the research into plastics is ongoing, the experts I spoke to agree that avoiding it wherever possible is worth the extra effort. “I tend to be pretty strict on this one,” says Rogers. “Personally, I avoid heating food in any plastic with an automatic default to glassware.” Beyond never microwaving food in plastic, Vandenberg hopes people simply stop using it.

(And manufacturers should be mandated to engrave a warning in the lid “do not microwave” so that people are &actually made aware of it). reply winternewt 16 hours agorootparentprevIronically I always put the lid in for protection so food doesn&#x27;t explode and stain the oven.

Most likely the site just wants to make whatever they can from possible places to insert affiliate links regardless of the article, and that’s it.

I have no lid for them so I cover them with regular plates or with a wooden chopping board (even when I microwave them), with the upside that with the board as a cover I can stack another bowl on top in the fridge.But for food heating I find it very easy to just take the food from whatever container it’s in and put it in a regular bowl which I can microwave covered by a plate to contain the inevitable food explosion.Every one of the few times I microwaved even in high quality plastic containers they became soft and harder to handle. Also I always had the (probably very subjective) feeling that it subtly changes the taste of the food. Kind of how bottled water tastes when the PET bottle is left in the sun for a while.Anyway, I find the bowl+plate as an infinitely reusable option, easy to clean, and just takes a bit of extra care handling when hot. Also bowls and plates stack very nicely in the cupboard and not too expensive in IKEA. reply throwanem 16 hours agorootparent> microwave covered by a plate to contain the inevitable food explosionThe default (maximum) power setting dumps so much energy so fast into the water in your food that some of it boils, and the expanding steam spatters food everywhere. This is also what causes the \"burned on the outside, still cold in the middle\" effect with leftovers, which aren&#x27;t engineered to be microwaved on high the way most frozen packaged meals are.Use a lower power setting for longer, and pause to stir if possible. That way there&#x27;s more time for the heat to dissipate into the bulk of whatever you&#x27;re microwaving, and few to no tiny, messy steam explosions. reply close04 16 hours agorootparentI actually use lower power in multiple shorter “sessions” with some minutes in between, which even without stirring lets the heat transfer more uniformly through the food - almost exclusively leftovers.I discovered this accidentally since usually I go about other stuff while heating the food in the microwave (not the stove) and more often than not I completely forget about it even with the “ding”. Putting it though another session at low power, I noticed, makes the food very uniformly heated.But ever so often after a while heating there’ll be the random drop of water under some fat or something like that, and without a lid it will paint the inside of the oven a lovely shade of splatter. No downside with covering the food. reply developer93 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never microwaved wood, but I&#x27;m going to start, thanks! reply close04 7 hours agorootparentI use a cutting board that’s a single piece of oak if I remember correctly (no gluing of multiple blocks like with many bamboo boards).

But before commercial microwaves in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver restaurants became popular pieces of kitchen equipment, the common microwave was considered a luxury item!The microwave was invented accidentally in 1945 by a self-taught engineer named Percy Spencer, who was leading a radar project for the defence giant, Raytheon. While testing a new vacuum tube called a magnetron, he discovered that a chocolate bar in his pocket had melted from the heat. He decided to try another experiment by placing some popcorn kernels near the magnetron, and he watched as the kernels popped into fluffy popcorns.Next, Spencer placed an egg near the magnetron and the egg began to move from the heat creating pressure inside the egg. The egg exploded and Spencer saw that the yoke had become hot. He realised that the low-density energy from the magnetron could cook food quickly. He created a metal box with an opening through which he fed microwave power. The energy was trapped inside the box, which created a high-density magnetic field. He placed food inside the box, and the heat generated by the energy cooked the food.

I don&#x27;t get why \"I want to use less petroleum-derived products and eventually none at all\" is exempt from spreading through the social network as a worthwhile idea when literally everything else does.Again, people aren&#x27;t individually responsible for the systemic results of their choices, but their individual choices do create signals that result in systemic change.

I&#x27;m confused why you think that since I specifically mentioned social actions whose effects obviously lag behind concrete systemic change. The intent isn&#x27;t to reduce exposure to microplastics in a physical way, but in a social way. It&#x27;s about circles of social influence effecting change through ceremony and symbolism. The ceremony of not microwaving plastic (and more specifically, trying to avoid plastic as much as is practicably possible) is something that gets discussed and repeated through many social circles. The symbolism of avoiding specific companies - making them the faces of microplastic contamination - gives people their enemy. Duh, it&#x27;s boycotting.>Saying that the environment is so full of microplastics that conscious efforts to avoid them will be a waste of time is the opposite of excusing companies for filling the environment with microplastics.Absolutely and unequivocally incorrect. This is the exact demoralization I&#x27;m talking about: \"avoiding microplastics exposure is a waste of time\". It excuses the companies in the abstract because demoralized people don&#x27;t talk about&#x2F;look for alternatives, it is excuse granted by inaction. Which is better for Microplastics Inc - someone who says \"well I&#x27;ll just be exposed to microplastics anyway so I might as well buy from Microplastics Inc\" or \"I&#x27;m not buying from Microplastics Inc because they are really hurting the environment\". There is a reason why there are so many companies that try to depict themselves as green. They still don&#x27;t fear being depicted as greenwashers but that&#x27;s going to be their new fear.>It&#x27;s saying that the only thing that will be effective is to attack the sources rather than lifestyling your way out of it.Which is incorrect. Attacking the source requires a social movement. Trying to lifestyle your way out of it is what creates the social movement. I don&#x27;t genuinely think riding a bike to the coffee shop reduces global carbon emissions in any meaningful way, but the ceremony of doing so creates connection and resilience with other environmentalists. And it works. Just this year, we got massive improvements to both our bike infrastructure and public transit.>You&#x27;ve confused health for morality, then gone on to give a lecture about it.What does that even mean?

So let&#x27;s ignore other materials as possible solutions for now.)I presume that the problem here isn&#x27;t that microwaves are causing vaporization or spalling of the container material in such a way that microplastic particles coming from the outside of the container can end up in your food. (If that&#x27;s the case, then plastics are basically entirely screwed for this use-case, and we may as well give up on them entirely.)But presuming instead that the problem is only with your food interacting with the inner surface of the container, under heat&#x2F;acid&#x2F;etc — i.e. some kind of leeching or osmosis of the food against the container surface, causing the plasticizers in the container to \"exchange\" out...Then, if that&#x27;s the case, would it be possible to make a food storage container that&#x27;s mostly plastic, but then has \"just a little bit\" of glass, lining the inner surface? A glass barrier-layer, sort of like how plastics themselves are used as a barrier layer on the inside of aluminum cans? Resulting in something that&#x27;s a lot lighter-weight than a thick glass container, but a lot more \"inert\" than a plastic container?Glass is usually brittle, I know; and unlike a glass food-storage container, which is usually thick, plastic food-storage containers are usually more thin and flexible.

At scale, glassware is produced basically by just casting a blob of glass into a solid \"uninflated\" shape, and then inflating that shape in a blow-mold. No additive steps possible, since the rapid expansion of the glass in the blow-mold cools it too much to enable other glass to stick at that point.(And before you suggest making a mold in a \"w\" shape: the arch in the middle would either have too much internal stress — like a Prince Rupert&#x27;s drop — or do a nice gradual curve in a way that uses far too much material [= extra weight].)What you might want to try to find is a bento box that&#x27;s designed to be a collection of independent&#x2F;modular thinner-walled glass internal compartments, that all slot into a plastic outer racking.

Essentially, this forms a glass-like finish that provides a totally natural, and completely inert, solution to the problem of your drinks staining the bottle or leaving behind any residual aftertaste. This infusion also shields your fresh water from tasting like plastic on very hot days, making it akin to drinking straight from a sparkling clean glass.It&#x27;s not perfect in practice though (I find that the bottles can still absorb flavors of sports drinks, especially if you forget to wash them immediately after a ride).

Therefore tools to quantify or analyze them were not well refined, and likewise for methodologies. The specific issue of microplastics in microwaves is even newer than that. It&#x27;s evolving science, which is practically redundant because that&#x27;s what science always does. Cases of zero awareness to high awareness overnight are rare.

Don’t worry. reply voytec 19 hours agoprevLast time I was putting plastic in a microwave was some 5-7 years ago. I went to a registered nutrition specialist with obesity and obesity-based issues. The guy had programs either providing you with diet-appropriate daily recipes, or a daily delivery of 5 dishes in plastic containers. I was too lazy at the time for the former option. But the important part is: it was all about eating 5 times a day.The label on these boxes stated that you only have to break the (plastic) seal before putting the (plastic) box in a microwave. I was doing it for a year and a half, telling myself that it&#x27;s beneficial and I&#x27;m doing it to be healthy. I was _forcing_ myself to eat 5 times a day, never being hungry and never enjoying this food. And I was possibly contaminating it by heating food surrounded by plastic in the microwave.The guy was a moron, pushing his \"5 dishes a day is ideal for everyone\" mindset on every customer, with no regard to personal preference. I was eating 2-3 times a day before this program but I had no understanding of nutrition and was eating crap with higher amount of calories than I was burning. Eating 5 times a day during the program have not improved my health. And the food was awful. I sacrificed the pleasure of eating for some 18 months with no beneficial results.Theory:To lose weight, one needs to stay in a caloric deficit based on burning more calories than ingesting. To do it smart, one also has to understand macro-nutrients and not stuff themselves with more fat+carbs than one burns. The basics are:- proteins (amino-acids chains) are building blocks required to build&#x2F;restore cells- carbs and fat are fuel that one burns for energy- carbs are burned faster than fat and if you ingest more carbs and fat than you&#x27;ll burn - you&#x27;ll store fatIt&#x27;s that simple: burn more calories than the intake and avoid more fat+carbs than you can burn to actually burn and not store additional fat.Practice:For a few years now, I&#x27;m on a 20:4 intermittent fasting schedule, which translates to calories ingestion only during a single 4-hours-long window during the day. I went back to only eating in the late afternoon. I go to the gym in the morning and stay in caloric deficit &#x27;till the evening.I&#x27;m also on keto. The \"no gainz diet\" works for me personally, but is not a \"golden recipe\" for everyone trying to lose weight. Proper knowledge of nutrition basics is the key.And... I had to break keto once in last year. My weight went down to 56kg and body fat to 8%. Great sixpack but my face resembled meth addicts&#x27;. I&#x27;ve found no way to gain weight without bumping LDL cholesterol to unhealthy levels and decided to go with \"very-low-carb\" for 2 weeks. It worked and I&#x27;m back on keto. Happy to repeat the \"very-low-carb\" thing every year or half but overall - keto works well for me and keeping caloric deficit for the better part of the day reduces my hyperactivity. It&#x27;s a personal preference.I make all my food from basic ingredients, avoid plastics, have no microwave and I avoid frying, apart from making omelettes or scrambled eggs. And it&#x27;s rather rare despite my daily 3-6 eggs intake.I&#x27;m happy with the choices I made. Organic food (from veggies to organic-fed meat), daily gym and 10+km walk, no plastics involved apart from meat containers just for transport and overall understanding of what I&#x27;m doing to my body.And it&#x27;s all about personal preference: I know people on keto for whom eating early in the day works best, while I avoid any calories in the morning, apart from the fat in vitamin D3 softgel capsule. reply dirtyid 19 hours agoprevAre there any no plastic microwave containers that doesn&#x27;t get hot? reply ZoomerCretin 18 hours agoprevWhat an odd time to be alive.

I might use it for reheating something or melting some butter maybe once a month. Most of my meals are cooked in the oven or pan.

The fine comes after a long-running antitrust court battle dating back to 2009 when the Commission initially fined Intel a record $1.13 billion for abuse of dominance. While some of Intel's actions, like hidden rebates, were dropped on appeal due to lack of evidence of harm, the Commission upheld that Intel paid PC manufacturers to delay or limit products using AMD processors. Specifically, the Commission cited examples where Intel paid HP not to sell AMD-powered business PCs to small and medium businesses through direct channels from 2002-2005. It also paid Acer to delay the launch of an AMD-based notebook from late 2003 to early 2004. Intel also paid Lenovo to push back the launch of AMD notebooks by six months. France could force Apple to recall all iPhone 12s According to the General Court, by placing these conditions on payments, Intel was able to limit the competitive threat posed by AMD desktops in key market segments. The Commission said the new €376 million fine reflects that Intel hindered the development and expansion of its main competitors in the x86 CPU market during nearly 5 years. As a result of those restrictions, computer manufacturers halted, delayed or placed restrictions on the commercialisation of products based on a competitor's chipsets, which they had actively planned and for which there was consumer demand. Intel's naked restrictions therefore had a detrimental effect on competition in the market, by depriving customers of a choice which they would have otherwise had. However, the fight is not over as the Commission has appealed the dismissal of the rebates part of the case. And Intel could still face more fines if the appeal court rules the rebates also violated competition laws. The €376 million fine is now set in stone as Intel did not appeal that ruling.

This court case is from a long time ago, but look at the market since the Ryzen inception, the last five years, and you&#x27;ll find it hard to purchase worthwhile AMD stuff outside of some niches (desktop CPUs, low quality plastic gaming laptops with TN screens, or super low quality budget laptops with sub-Ryzen apus). Just go to BestBuy, or browse Newegg, or else, and good luck finding a great Ryzen product in stock that you can purchase. All the interesting stuff, for creators, or graphic designers, or anything high end, they only have Intel products for sale.Try this: find me an in-stock 2-in-1 Ryzen 7 or 9 metal case laptop with high nits 2k+ touchscreen, no discrete GPU, great backlit keyboard, a large battery, and a spare M.2 slot.Or try to find anything bizarre or exotic (like those laptop with 2 screens instead of 1 + keyboard). Nothing with AMD, ever.Almost all are &#x2F; were easy to find in Intel flavor. Have fun trying to put your hands on any worthwile AMD product. reply panick21_ 4 hours agoparentI think its far more about how Intel has its own fabs and has far larger capacity in production. AMD is production limited and depends on TSMC and shares new nodes with Apple and others.I don&#x27;t really see the issue, there are Ryzen think pads I could order right now.> Try this: find me an in-stock 2-in-1 Ryzen 7 or 9 metal case laptop with high nits 2k+ touchscreen, no discrete GPU, great backlit keyboard, a large battery, and a spare M.2 slot.Maybe it just that your tastes are not that common. reply runeks 5 hours agoparentprevDevil’s advocate: where’s the evidence that this is caused by anti-competitive practices by Intel?Most people have no idea what AMD or Intel — let alone a CPU — is. It seems plausible that AMD isn’t popular because the average consumer isn’t demanding it. reply wildrhythms 2 hours agorootparent>where’s the evidence that this is caused by anti-competitive practices by Intel?The examples cited in the article:>Specifically, the Commission cited examples where Intel paid HP not to sell AMD-powered business PCs to small and medium businesses through direct channels from 2002-2005. It also paid Acer to delay the launch of an AMD-based notebook from late 2003 to early 2004. Intel also paid Lenovo to push back the launch of AMD notebooks by six months. reply runeks 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m not taking about the article. I&#x27;m asking the person I&#x27;m replying to who says \"The situation is still the same, happening as we speak\". reply bayindirh 2 hours agorootparentprevWhile I can’t give the specifics, I can say that I have experienced this in the server space repeatedly.Manufacturers were not able to design equivalent servers due to pressure from Intel, or need to delay equivalent or more powerful AMD platforms.AMD is still has more PCIe lanes and better for high bandwidth requiring tasks like dense GPU computing. reply eatyourglory 3 hours agorootparentprevI know for sure most people don&#x27;t know either of them.But, more people know the name Intel from those Intel stickers on those old laptops people used back in the day.So because those worked fine for them, they just choose to ask for the same name, making Intel over AMD.I&#x27;m sure there are more factors than just these that make Intel the most popular CPU brand, but this is the best one I could think. reply baz00 6 hours agoparentprevI think it’s more complicated than that. It’s not just incentivised stuff from intel. There is little to no market for high end stuff from AMD. Some vendors tried and it didn’t sell. Most of the workstation consumers I know won’t touch AMD after a couple of bad experiences. Even had one myself where I had to dump an AMD desktop because of reliability issues which went on for months. reply tjoff 6 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean there is no market for high end stuff from AMD? That&#x27;s like saying \"there is no market for high end PCs\". I know people are confused, but they are not buying \"an Intel\", they are buying \"a Dell\". If that happened to have an AMD CPU inside 98% of people would never now - unless Dell made a point to tell them.Yes, some vendors tried to put a good CPU in a budget chassi, worst screen you could find, no battery life, terrible build quality etc. No shit it didn&#x27;t sell.And not sure what \"bad experiences\" here amount to, has nothing to do with what CPU was inside but most probably the brand of the device. And that might partly because the vendor had no experience in that ecosystem and had to do much from scratch or whatever.But most likely they just didn&#x27;t put in the effort (if the poor build quality and components didn&#x27;t already tell you that), which kind of makes sense given the weird situation we are in.How much of that can be attributed to intel, and how much can be attributed to vendors having absolutely no vision and no desire to make anything but literal safe crap, I have no idea.But, even if intel didn&#x27;t do anything wrong I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised with the outcome. It is not like the ecosystem for intel hardware is great either. It took decades before microsoft gave up and launched their own Surface-line of computers simply because all the combined efforts of all manufacturers could barely produce anything of value.Just as google had to launch their own Pixel line because all other vendors would just produce crap that people then associated with android. reply baz00 6 hours agorootparentCompletely wrong. Purchasers buy Intel if there is a choice. A huge amount of people got burned by shitty AMD hardware. Right into Ryzen era. Intel stuff tends to just work.As for problems it’s usually reliability issues with power management, network and occasional crashes. And that’s from big brand integrators like Lenovo. You just don’t get the same poor experience with their Intel parts.I mean when we bought a huge chunk of T14s recently, an actual factor in the decision analysis was “not the AMD variety”.It might be hardware, it might be software but no one has the time or energy to dig through that.Anecdotally I built a Ryzen 3700X workstation from scratch a couple of years ago. Nothing but trouble. Some days it wouldn’t even boot until the third attempt. And that gets to decision makers and they make decisions. reply danmur 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s just one computer so not much of a data point, but I feel obliged to mention I&#x27;ve had a desktop AMD (Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core) running databases and various other applications for a couple years and it&#x27;s been superb. Not one single issue, never have to reboot it, last time it went off was about four months ago from a power failure.My biggest complaint is that it&#x27;s even harder (or possibly more confusing) to work out how to get an AMD running ECC RAM than it is for Intel, and that&#x27;s saying something. reply nottorp 3 hours agorootparentprev> A huge amount of people got burned by shitty AMD hardware.AMD or whatever crap Dell put in to keep AMD the cheapest crappiest option, perhaps contingent on “marketing funds” from Intel?If you build it yourself you can get a fast stable AMD desktop.

If you consider 1. the game-theoretic problem that the vendors have (specifically the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma), and 2. the fact that many of them seem to operate on smaller margins and 3. certainly do not have the benefit of operating from monopoly that Intel had, it may be that accepting the bribes is the way to go. Are you going to wait 10, 20, maybe 30 years for some government to finally step in on your competitors that accepted the bribes? reply ilyt 1 hour agoparentprevNot that shocking really. They take parts, put it in boxes and sell it to customers that don&#x27;t care much whether label in part says Intel or AMD.If Intel gonna say \"we literally will pay you more to use our parts\", that&#x27;s pure profit to them, customers still gonna buy it because if they cared more about the CPU than the rest of the value propositon of Dell&#x2F;Lenovo they wouldn&#x27;t buy from them in the first place. reply makeitdouble 12 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a good point, and would be the right thing to do in this case, but I think it opens a can of worms than even the EU is no ready to open now.It goes down to \"are exclusive deals illegal ?\" and I&#x27;d assume it could go as far as small companies accepting to get bought by the market behemoth, or employees getting paid under no-compete contracts to not work at rival companies. reply danmur 5 hours agoparentprevYep 100%. This wasn&#x27;t a one-player game. reply shkkmo 13 hours agoparentprevIt think the general rule of thumbs is that accepting money to help other companies monopolize their markets is fine as long as you don&#x27;t try to monopolize your own.Personally, I think that all the stuff like this should also be illegal, even without a monopoly. Exclusivity contracts and stuff with that goal should be illegal.However, we&#x27;ll have to pass new laws to get there. reply avar 11 hours agorootparentIs general it&#x27;s not so clear cut.If I make wheat and you run a bakery I might offer you a 30% discount for the next 5 years, but only if I&#x27;m your only wheat supplier.This sort of arrangement allows us to spread the risk of market uncertainties over that period.I can then build extra capacity, and you get a cheaper product, or one with less price uncertainty.Maybe we should do away with this, and say that bakeries must buy wheat like airlines buy fuel, i.e. through more complex financial instruments.Now, I may be doing this because I&#x27;m one of only two companies making wheat, and I&#x27;m looking to drive the other one out of business. That&#x27;s basically what Intel was doing here.But it&#x27;s not clear to me that we should conclude that exclusivity deals in general are bad. reply bruce511 11 hours agorootparentI agree, and it works the other way to.Say I&#x27;m a local wheat producer. I sign a deal with the local bakery. That stops a multi-national from undercutting me.The contract cements the benefit that both I and the bakery have from mutually working together, and removes the risk to both parties of some outside party damaging both of us.In other words exclusivity works for small companies in spaces dominated by behemoths.Think craft beer and local pub. reply Jochim 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s far more likely that the multi-national has already signed such a contract with the bakery, preventing you from entering the market in the first place.Even if you were to get there first, when the contract comes up for renewal the multi-national can offer terms that would be unsustainable for a small producer. reply ncallaway 9 hours agorootparentprevThey should be illegal if the company owns or controls 5% or more of the given market. reply ethbr1 11 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a visibility question too.If Intel comes to my computer company and offers me a sweet rebate, what do I know about what they&#x27;re doing with my competitors?So if it were illegal to receive money to help a company monopolize their market, how would the company receiving the funds be able to determine that&#x27;s the case? reply Jensson 13 hours agoparentprevAre there any laws prohibiting you from accepting these deals? reply indymike 13 hours agorootparentRebates are usually legal in the US, but go to the distributor or the final buyer. I used to sell huge amounts of computer hardware at a small loss, and a month later would be making 15-20% profit once rebates were paid to my company.Bribes are paid by (or directed to be paid to someone else by) the person who is buying (or a sales representative selling) and their employer never sees the money. That&#x27;s why direct incentives to salespeople (spiffs) should be authorized in writing, by the employer. An example of a bribe would be a purchasing agent requiring me to donate 5% of the deal value to their church to get a deal. reply mnau 13 hours agorootparentprevBribery is illegal for the person bribing and the person being bribed.Generally the person who is bribing has higher penalty, because she is an instigator, but both are culpable.It makes sense, by accepting the bribe, you do damage to some third party. \"I was stealing, but only because he offered me money\"... nope.At least in my country and I assume in the rest of EU countries. reply Jensson 13 hours agorootparentOffering a good deal isn&#x27;t bribery. Bribery is when you give a decisionmaker money to make him make decisions against the wishes of the organization he represents. In this case it is in the interests of these companies to take these deals since they were good for them, they weren&#x27;t bribed to take it. reply denton-scratch 3 hours agorootparentprev> because she is an instigatorNot sure about that.\"I will only stock your product if you can make the deal sweeter for me than your competitor is offering to do.\" reply lemper 2 hours agoprevI couldn&#x27;t care less who can buy what with how much effort in some market. but I really really love it when EU slaps some companies with hundreds of millions of fine. way to go EU! as long as your politicians are not corrupt, that is! reply pella 12 hours agoprev\"Questions & Answers - Antitrust: Commission re-imposes €376.36 million fine on Intel for anticompetitive practices in the market for computer chips\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;qanda_...\"Antitrust: Commission re-imposes €376.36 million fine on Intel for anticompetitive practices in the market for computer chips\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;IP_23_... reply jongjong 12 hours agoprevWhat kind of economy is this that a supplier can afford to pay meaningful sums to their customers?

Especially since, if there hadn&#x27;t been patents, they would have just had everything as trade secrets. It&#x27;s not like patenting rounded corners, most of the stuff that gives Intel and AMD an edge is highly complex and innovative. reply panick21_ 4 hours agorootparentLook at companies like Cyrix for example. They made some good 86x processors in the 90s but were also constantly involved in legal battles. AMD was literally in an ongoing legal battle for 20 years straight.In the 90s you had other companies that could have built x86 chips, if they would have been allowed two. Digital Alpha was the bases for the AMD chips that kicked Intel so hard that they resorted paying their supplier to not adopt it. Digital could have done a x86 but they would have been in a lawsuit with intel.Intel also didn&#x27;t really have an advantage on the node for most of that period. reply runeks 5 hours agorootparentprevThat’s the essential problem with parents: nobody really know how it affects competition. And therefore the status quo doesn’t change.I think we should swap the burden of proof: patents should be abolished if it cannot be shown that they’re a net positive for consumers. We shouldn’t be supporting a practice whose effect is unknown and possibly detrimental to consumers. reply runeks 5 hours agorootparentprev> Especially since, if there hadn&#x27;t been patents, they would have just had everything as trade secrets.Reverse engineering the x86 instruction set would be rather trivial for even a small company.

No clearly not, IBM had its own (more then 1), various Unix, VMS, CSM, various DOS, lots of costume proprietary stuff.Monopoly in machine architecture? Clearly not, you had IBM mainframe and midrange, you had DEC Vax (and PDP11 still around). DEC had many competitors, most failed in the early 80s. But were replaced by Motorola based workstations and servers. HP was a big player in the 80s. You had Apple doing its own thing. PC based systems were on the rise, including being used as servers. You also still had a huge amount of 8-bit micros being sold as well. I don&#x27;t see a monopoly.Lets talk about processors fabs. Lots more companies had fabs back then. IBM, DEC, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, NEC, Motorola, National Semiconductor, HP and even Commodore had their own fabs and you had contract fabs like VLSI. Monopoly?And there was so much more strange stuff happening in Britain, Germany and so on.So please, actual tell me what monopoly you are talking about instead vaguely referencing abstract concepts!> Take for example the story of RISC. The architecture is only now being \"rediscovered\" after being crushed for decades.This is just complete nonsense. First of all the RISC&#x2F;CISC division isn&#x27;t as relevant today as it was then, and the idea that &#x27;RISC&#x27; was lost is complete nonsense.Sun&#x2F;Oracle&#x2F;Toshiba and co build new SPARC to this day, Tosbia mainframes have been running on SPARC this whole time. Lots of IBM stuff runs on POWER to this day as well. Even in the 2010s SGI MIPS based clusers were common. And during this whole time MIPS and RISC basically owned the embedded markets between them.

However, that is not a reason to ignore antitrust as \"outdated regulation\". If anything, AMD is doing a some of the same shit Intel did when they were dominant, because that&#x27;s just how the CPU market works now, itself because we let Intel set the standard of behavior a decade ago by failing to punish them for cheating.Anyway, that&#x27;s why we need more overly punitive fines detached from reality. reply Analemma_ 14 hours agoparentprevThe headline here is a bit misleading.

CPU market is duopoly, even today.$1 billion fine seems like a lot, but let&#x27;s assume $100&#x2F;CPU, 50% profit margin and 5 years (2002-2007). 1000_000_0000 &#x2F; 100 &#x2F; 2 &#x2F; 5 = 1 000 000. So you would need to sell 1 million CPUs to make a $1 billion profit over 5 years. Eminently doable on EU laptop market, even back then.Definitely doesn&#x27;t seem disproportionate. reply edgyquant 13 hours agorootparentThe x86 CPU market is a duopoly you mean reply 3836293648 14 hours agoparentprevThis is a case from 2007 that got caught up in appeal after appeal. That they&#x27;ve lost ground since does mean they don&#x27;t deserve fines they&#x27;ve been delaying for ~15 years. reply bushbaba 14 hours agorootparentYou’d think the fines would have inflation baked into it 15 years is a long time with intel stock up more than 80% over last 15 years. reply ekeane 13 hours agorootparentEh? Intel stock is basically flat in that time. It was ~28 around this time in 2007 (IIRC, was my hire date), and its now 32.Intel stock is a lot of things, but &#x27;up 80%&#x27; hasn&#x27;t been something true since the early 2000s.ETA: That was 16 years ago I was thinking of, I forgot about the nasty dip in 2008. I misremembered, it was ~26 when I was hired, dipped to 18 the next year, and slowly climbed a while and has been around that $30&#x2F;share number for ages. reply blibble 12 hours agorootparentprevshould tie it to inflation or the percentage increase in their stock price, whichever is higher reply gumballindie 14 hours agorootparentprevHmm isnt that usually a sign of corruption and influencing the justice system? reply Jensson 14 hours agorootparentThe initial claim included \"below cost\", intel argues it didn&#x27;t sell units below cost. Likely they swamped the investigation team with spreadsheets of all processes and such included in those costs and then I can see it being hard to make progress since you need to go through it to determine if they sold below cost or not.But the important part is that Intel stopped doing those things after the investigation started so that AMD could compete. If they didn&#x27;t it would be very easy to prove that they are anti competitive. So even though the fines are late the effects have already been here for a long time with AMD doing well today. reply nickjj 14 hours agorootparentDoes below cost only apply for selling certain types of 1-off physical goods?A lot of online apps tend to operate at a loss to gain a large audience and then once they&#x27;ve gained market share they often increase fees or more generally make it more expensive for users. Their business model forces smaller competitors out because a larger funded company can in theory hold out for a longer period of time at a loss.It&#x27;s surprising this is ok but selling a piece of hardware at a loss is not ok. What about Costco selling rotisserie chickens at a loss to get people in the store or the idea of a \"loss leader\"? reply Jensson 14 hours agorootparentNot sure, but I think arguments like is why this lawsuit took so much time. For simpler goods and smaller scale \"below cost\" to hurt competition is very easy to prove, but when Intel did that for the entirety of Europe and their massive process it was apparently easy for Intel to hide what they did.> What about Costco selling rotisserie chickens at a loss to get people in the store or the idea of a \"loss leader\"?Isn&#x27;t the usual argument that they got surplus stock in some way? Then it isn&#x27;t below cost, it is loss minimization from a bad investment, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt competition for chicken since it is a limited amount of time. reply brewdad 13 hours agorootparentWhether you have 100 chickens or 100 million, if they cost you $6 and you sell them for $5, that&#x27;s below cost.Also, it isn&#x27;t limited amount of time. This has been Costco&#x27;s MO for decades. reply Jensson 13 hours agorootparent> Also, it isn&#x27;t limited amount of time. This has been Costco&#x27;s MO for decades.Have they sold chicken at below cost for decades with no stop? Really? I think you mean they have sold small portions of their wares at below cost, not that they have sold a specific thing at below cost for extended amounts of time.> Whether you have 100 chickens or 100 million, if they cost you $6 and you sell them for $5, that&#x27;s below cost.Yeah, but the store as a whole isn&#x27;t selling at below cost, and on average since those chickens aren&#x27;t sold at below cost all the time they still make money from chickens. Those things means that on average the store is net positive, and them selling chickens is a net positive. Hence overall they don&#x27;t sell anything at a net loss, its just for short periods of time they do it and those can be hand waved away. There are a lot of laws surrounding limited time offers that they have to follow. replyflangola7 14 hours agoparentprevIntel absolutely tried to drown AMD in the 2000s. The fines are warranted. reply fbdab103 13 hours agorootparentI do wonder - in a parallel universe where Intel had not played dirty - would AMD have naturally risen on top?

The key difference is that the USA is boastful of their innovation but has epic cognitive dissonance when it comes to government intervention. Whereas the EU is boastful of their market distortions while innovation is often hidden behind language barriers. reply benreesman 10 hours agoprev [–] I’ll leave the lawyering to the lawyers, but big picture it seems weird to be hitting Intel with any of the “you need to play fair” stuff.They’re operating at between a 2-4 process node handicap (depending how one counts) and turning out workable stuff (e.g. Raptor Lake) strictly by competing their butts off on micro architecture and other hard, legitimate stuff. My hat is fucking off to the people turning out product that keeps them in the race with thermal&#x2F;transistor budgets from like, before COVID.There’s a dude in my building who wears an ASML badge and I always ask him: Gelsinger going to get EUV going? He obviously can’t answer but he gets this little smirk.I would love it if it all landed at once: HDET SKUs with 128 physical cores, ARC cards competitive with 4xxx and drivers, and a domestic pure-play foundry business that the PRC can’t even remotely disrupt in their wildest dreams.AMD wants to generate some cap?

It is the intention to support both WDM and WDF driver development models. This repo contains the following crates: wdk-build: A library to configure a Cargo build script for binding generation and downstream linking of the WDK (Windows Developer Kit). While this crate is written to be flexible with different WDK releases and different WDF version, it is currently only tested for NI eWDK, KMDF 1.33, UMDF 2.33, and WDM Drivers. There may be missing linker options for older DDKs. wdk-sys: Direct FFI bindings to APIs available in the Windows Development Kit (WDK). This includes both autogenerated ffi bindings from bindgen, and also manual re-implementations of macros that bindgen fails to generate. wdk: Safe idiomatic bindings to APIs available in the Windows Development Kit (WDK) wdk-panic: Default panic handler implementations for programs built with WDK wdk-alloc: alloc support for binaries compiled with the Windows Development Kit (WDK) wdk-macros: A collection of macros that help make it easier to interact with wdk-sys's direct bindings. This crate is re-exported via wdk-sys and crates should typically never need to directly depend on wdk-macros To see an example of this repo used to create drivers, see Windows-rust-driver-samples. Note: This project is still in early stages of development and is not yet recommended for commercial use. We encourage community experimentation, suggestions and discussions! We will be using our GitHub Discussions forum as the main form of engagement with the community! Supported Configurations This project was built with support of WDM, KMDF, and UMDF drivers in mind, as well as Win32 Services. This includes support for all versions of WDF included in WDK 22H2 and newer. Currently, the crates available on crates.io only support KMDF v1.33, but bindings can be generated for everything else by cloning windows-drivers-rs and modifying the config specified in build.rs of wdk-sys. Crates.io support for other WDK configurations is planned in the near future. Getting Started Build Requirements Binding generation via bindgen requires libclang. The easiest way to acquire this is via winget winget install LLVM.LLVM To execute post-build tasks (ie. inf2cat, infverif, etc.), cargo make is used cargo install --locked cargo-make --no-default-features --features tls-native Building programs with the WDK also requires being in a valid WDK enviroment. The recommended way to do this is to enter an eWDK developer prompt Adding windows-drivers-rs to Your Driver Package The crates in this repository are available from crates.io, but take into account the current limitations outlined in Supported Configurations. If you need to support a different config, try cloning this repo and using path dependencies Create a new Cargo package with a lib crate: cargo new--lib --config Add dependencies on windows-drivers-rs crates: cdcargo add --build wdk-build cargo add wdk wdk-sys wdk-alloc wdk-panic Set the crate type to cdylib by adding the following snippet to Cargo.toml: [lib] crate-type = [\"cdylib\"] Set crate panic strategy to abort in Cargo.toml: [profile.dev] panic = \"abort\" lto = true # optional setting to enable Link Time Optimizations [profile.release] panic = \"abort\" lto = true # optional setting to enable Link Time Optimizations Create a build.rs and add the following snippet: fn main() -> Result { wdk_build::Config::from_env_auto()?.configure_binary_build(); Ok(()) } Mark your driver as no_std in lib.rs: #![no_std] Add a panic handler in lib.rs: #[cfg(not(test))] extern crate wdk_panic; Add a global allocator in lib.rs: #[cfg(not(test))] use wdk_alloc::WDKAllocator; #[cfg(not(test))] #[global_allocator] static GLOBAL_ALLOCATOR: WDKAllocator = WDKAllocator; Add a DriverEntry in lib.rs: use wdk_sys::{ DRIVER_OBJECT, NTSTATUS, PCUNICODE_STRING, }; #[export_name = \"DriverEntry\"] // WDF expects a symbol with the name DriverEntry pub unsafe extern \"system\" fn driver_entry( driver: &mut DRIVER_OBJECT, registry_path: PCUNICODE_STRING, ) -> NTSTATUS { 0 } Add a Makefile.toml: extend = \".cargo-make-loadscripts/rust-driver-makefile.toml\" [env] CARGO_MAKE_EXTEND_WORKSPACE_MAKEFILE = true [config] load_script = \"\"\" pwsh.exe -Command \"\\ if ($env:CARGO_MAKE_CRATE_IS_WORKSPACE) { return };\\ $cargoMakeURI = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/windows-drivers-rs/main/rust-driver-makefile.toml';\\ New-Item -ItemType Directory .cargo-make-loadscripts -Force;\\ Invoke-RestMethod -Method GET -Uri $CargoMakeURI -OutFile $env:CARGO_MAKE_WORKSPACE_WORKING_DIRECTORY/.cargo-make-loadscripts/rust-driver-makefile.toml\\ \" \"\"\" Add an inx file that matches the name of your cdylib crate.

The Linux kernel has similar issues when it comes to writing Rust drivers, and so does every other project interoperating with C.Types like NTSTATUS have a significant amount of documentation attached to it. Unlike C and C++, you can&#x27;t just assign an integer value to an enum value. I suppose they could&#x27;ve generated a wrapper class and required you to cast every time, but then you&#x27;d get code that&#x27;s 50% .into()s and that would probably add overhead to your driver as well.As far as I can tell, you never set or alter these enum values, other than maybe the void* for buffer; you only ever read from them. A match {} block should work just fine on NTSTATUS. WDFREQUEST is a handle, so you can&#x27;t really do anything with it other than maybe swap it out for another handle of the same type.Timer and SpinLock have been converted into idiomatic Rust objects, wrapping unsafe library calls in their bodies. Other than that, I don&#x27;t really see how you&#x27;d make this code idiomatic without adding a significant performance burden. reply BaculumMeumEst 2 hours agoparentprevcould you clarify what you mean? reply kramerger 3 hours agoparentprevI think they would need to rewrite everything to get rid of that reply fortran77 8 hours agoprev [–] You know what would be even better? Device drivers in a memory managed language like C#! reply jeroenhd 1 hour agoparentMicrosoft is pushing more and more code into user space. The latest change is that they now insist printer manufacturers use UWP printer apps rather than drivers to add custom functionality to their printers; these apps are usually written in languages like C#.I agree with Microsoft that the best method is probably to run less manufacturer code in the kernel, not to make the kernel accessible more easily. Running a garbage collector in the kernel sounds near impossible to pull off without GC bugs because C# isn&#x27;t exactly suited for \"I want to access some buffer but I can&#x27;t because it hasn&#x27;t been paged in and I&#x27;m in an interrupt handler\". reply danparsonson 8 hours agoparentprevWould that be better though? I have no experience of driver development by my feeling is that device drivers being low-level and fundamental building blocks of a working operating system, doesn&#x27;t fit well with garbage collection interrupting execution on its own schedule. reply sonthonax 6 hours agorootparentDepends what you’re writing to be honest. reply CodeCompost 5 hours agoparentprevMicrosoft tried that already. It failed miserably.

Every time I open a web page with Spotify embed mouse freezes for ~0.5 to 1 second and then continues moving, I haven&#x27;t found any reason for it, it happens with Firefox, Google Chrome, and Edge.It&#x27;s been repeatable ever since I bought a Ryzen 7950X at the beginning of the year, that&#x27;s why I tried using system profiler tools to find the reason but as I have no good experience in this it&#x27;s difficult to find the root cause. reply tjalfi 0 minutes agorootparentYou can use UI4ETW[0] to capture an event trace when the mouse freezes.

Try a new user on windows (user space apps) Try a fresh install (system stuff) If you have spinning rust try another hard drive (an app doing stupid blocking exclusive stuff with writing or reading can pause input stuff). reply londons_explore 8 hours agorootparentprevDays of lag-free mice are well and truly over...(Sitting here running wayland, where the mouse feels stuck in molasses!) reply morjom 8 hours agorootparent(Sitting here running Wayland aswell, where the mouse feels just fine) reply tentacleuno 1 hour agorootparent(Sat here using KDE Plasma on Wayland where the mouse lagged and glitched every time you opened a program.)I think later versions fixed this one, though. reply self_awareness 6 hours agorootparentprevI wish I had a problem with mouse on Wayland, but it doesn&#x27;t run for me at all reply davet91 2 hours agorootparentprevWhich compositor are you using?If it&#x27;s Gnome, the very recent release 45 has improvements running the cursor in a separate thread.I personally run KDE and agree that you can feel a difference between the X11 and Wayland session but it&#x27;s not terrible. reply heavyset_go 4 hours agorootparentprevMight be worth it to check that you have the \"Adaptive\" acceleration profile with a positive pointer acceleration value set in your mouse settings. reply IshKebab 5 hours agorootparentprevCheck your display refresh rate. I had issues on Linux with it not supporting the maximum HDMI bandwidth properly so it drops the refresh rate to 30Hz which makes mice super laggy. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not a Wayland issue. It may be a specific Wayland bug that affects you, but the architecture of the system does not force any extra delays. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentImagine we are half way through sending a frame to the display.The cursor is in the bottom half of the screen.If I move the cursor, that should be represented in the frame that&#x27;s being currently outputted, not the next frame.Wayland has no support for that, by design.The end result is that there is always a delay of at least one Frame. reply mhh__ 3 hours agorootparentprevAs opposed to a stall induced by reference counting?Don&#x27;t allocate => don&#x27;t need to collect. reply jayd16 7 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not that hard to write no-alloc C# code.

Drivers must have very strict control over availability of memory because it will likely access it at times when a page fault is not possible (i.e. during an interrupt handler). The C# language and runtime would have to add features to explicitly accomodate this at a bare minimum reply tonyedgecombe 5 hours agorootparentMicrosoft did have an experimental OS[1] written in a variant of C# so it doesn&#x27;t seem completely unrealistic.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Midori_(operating_system)My guess is the internal politics would be a bigger problem than any technical issues. reply anaisbetts 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not unrealistic but Midori made a lot of changes to C# to make it possible, it was almost a different language by the end of the project reply tester756 5 hours agorootparentLearnings from Midori were partially incorporated into C# reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentStarting in C# 7, and still being done in newer versions. replynextaccountic 6 hours agoparentprevC# doesn&#x27;t help against data racesIndeed pretty much no mainstream language prevents data races at compile time like Rust does reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentRust only helps in a specifc use case of data races, when the memory belongs to the same process and is being access by threads.Rust type system doesn&#x27;t help when the data resides in a shared memory segment accessed by multiple processes. reply nextaccountic 1 hour agorootparentRust helps against data races in a kernel, as shown by the Rust for Linux project and other kernel projects (Redox, etc).Of course if you interact with foreign code (including code in other programs, but also code in the same program written in another language), you need unsafe. Or if you write a new synchronization primitive, etc. The unsafe is there to say \"I manually checked and this is okay\".What&#x27;s important is that with Rust, concurrent business logic - in a kernel, things like filesystems and drivers - shouldn&#x27;t need any unsafe to synchronize correctly. You use unsafe for your lower level infrastructure, but the code that actually does things can be data race free (and thus is easier to modify and assure it&#x27;s working correctly). And that&#x27;s incredible. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentFilesystems get modified by third parties.Also the right way to implement filesystems and drivers in modern OSes should be in userspace drivers, which is the route being taken by Apple, Google and Microsoft across their OSes anyway. replyMStrehovsky 6 hours agoparentprevHere&#x27;s an example [1] of a device driver in C#.

It may be better integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem but from the point of view of a driver developer who has to support more than one OS, Rust would seem to be a good tradeoff between security, performance, and reliability vs. C&#x2F;C++. reply Yoric 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m a big fan of Rust (and a minor contributor), but one can&#x27;t deny that a garbage-collector makes most developments much easier. Now, I&#x27;m not convinced that a gc makes much sense in driver development, but I could be wrong. reply dboreham 3 hours agorootparentNot wrong. Kernels usually have their own memory management schemes, tied to the lifetime of i&#x2F;o ops and so on. It would make more sense to somehow integrate that into the driver programing language. reply knorker 3 hours agorootparentprevIt makes some things easier, and some things harder, or more complex.So I can deny that most development becomes easier with GC. At least if you also intend to actually run the thing. Running Java means forever fighting the GC, needing to do runtime and development to reduce impact of inherent GC problems. reply shanoaice 2 hours agorootparentBut it&#x27;s a Java issue: Java relies on Heap Objects way too much.

SIGN IN SUBSCRIBE ABOUT THANKS PODCAST NEWS Why Scalpers Can Get Olivia Rodrigo Tickets and You Can't JASON KOEBLER · SEP 21, 2023 AT 2:04 PM Ticketmaster's \"Verified Fan\" system doesn't help fans. It helps scalpers who have hundreds of accounts, use special internet browsers, and have dozens of credit cards.

This site is funded by subscribers and you will be directly powering our journalism. JOIN THE NEWSLETTER TO GET THE LATEST UPDATES. The “verified fan” concert ticket presale for pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo’s upcoming Guts Tour is today, and, yet again, it’s worth remembering that Ticketmaster stacks the deck heavily in favor of ticket scalpers, regardless of what the company says. I’ve written about Ticketmaster and ticket scalping for more than a decade, and have covered various fiascos for fans, including the Taylor Swift Eras Tour, the recent Blink-182 tour, and the Cure tour. I have also reported on anti-scalping strategies implemented by Ticketmaster that, in practice, benefit scalpers. The main reason scalpers continue to get tickets and fans continue to be upset is because ticket scalpers are professional ticket buyers, who in many cases have navigated Ticketmaster’s buying process every day for years. The average music fan, meanwhile, might try to buy tickets a couple times a year at most, and doesn’t spend their days thinking of ways to optimize the ticket buying process. Twitter is already full of fans who are confused about the onsale process for Olivia Rodrigo and are wondering why it took Ticketmaster so long to send out codes to buy them. It is also full of people who got waitlisted for tickets: “DEMAND IS HIGH,” Ticketmaster said in a tweet. “Fan response to Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS world tour has been massive, and despite adding 20 more dates to better meet demand, there are still far more registered fans than tickets available.” 🎟 Do you know anything else about ticket scalping or Ticketmaster? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +1 202 505 1702. Otherwise, send me an email at jason@404media.co. It is still unclear whether there’s even going to be a public sale for these tickets. With Taylor Swift, Ticketmaster canceled the public sale altogether. This system has the effect of making huge swaths of fans upset, but scalpers have figured out how to circumvent it. Here’s why scalpers are getting Olivia Rodrigo tickets, and you probably aren’t. “Verified Fan” Olivia Rodrigo is using a system very similar to the one used by Taylor Swift, which Ticketmaster calls “Verified Fan.” This is essentially a weighted lottery in which people have to pre-register for a chance to buy tickets. Ticketmaster then uses an algorithm that is nominally tied to previous buying history, the age of an account, and the account’s geographic location to determine whether that account can have a chance to buy tickets for specific shows. Become a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus content. This site is funded by subscribers and you will be directly powering our journalism. The problem with this is that normal people have one Ticketmaster account tied to one email address and can therefore enter this lottery one time for one specific show. Serious ticket scalpers have many accounts (hundreds or thousands) tied to many different email addresses, with credit cards all over the country and can enter the lottery as many times as they want. As Joseph and I showed earlier this year, there is a black market for “aged” Ticketmaster accounts that are years old and might have a better chance of winning the Verified Fan lottery. Scalpers can buy “100 Phone Verified Ticketmaster Accounts” for $500 from a scalper-focused website, or they can buy “1,000 Phone Verified Ticketmaster Accounts.” “All Accounts have been created with unique USA residential proxies. Unique password for each account. Will be creating accounts on your own catchall emails/gmails/hotmails/yahoos. We have not added billing info as you have to add your own credit + billing info,” one advertisement states. One scalper I spoke to on the condition of anonymity to talk about industry practices told me that scalpers use these accounts to win Verified Fan lotteries. But that scalper said they simply create their own Ticketmaster accounts. Ticketmaster now requires text message phone number verification, but they can bypass this by buying “Mobile Virtual Network Operator” phone numbers in bulk from eBay, which are cheap phone numbers that can be bought for SMS verification from very small cell phone companies and people who resell numbers from those companies . There are also services online and on eBay that sell “SMS verification” for the purposes of creating new accounts. “We provide a SMS verification code forwarding service to enable you to verify your online accounts such as social media / email / delivery / dating sites etc,” one eBay listing reads. This scalper then ages the accounts by letting them sit for a while, or by buying tickets on the accounts over time. The sale of Ticketmaster accounts also lets scalpers sell tickets even when there are restrictions on scalping. Rather than selling the “tickets,” scalpers are selling the Ticketmaster accounts, with the tickets inside of those accounts. Credit Card Presales Before the “Verified Fan” presale, there was a special presale on Wednesday for American Express credit card holders (for Swift, the credit card presale was for Capital One cardholders). Credit card companies pay Ticketmaster and Live Nation so that their cardmembers can have exclusive access to tickets. Capital One also had an ad campaign with Swift. These credit card presales benefit scalpers, because serious ticket brokers have every sort of credit card, while every fan does not. Specialized Internet Browsers for Ticket Scalpers Tickets to popular events generally use a “virtual waiting room,” which is a lottery system on Ticketmaster’s website designed to prevent its servers from overloading. People are asked to open the event page at a certain time (usually 10 am local time) to get “in line” to buy tickets. Scalpers have the advantage here, too. The average fan opens a Chrome tab, goes to the event page, and gets in line one time. Each tab in Chrome is counted as the same “session,” and Ticketmaster’s software will sync those tabs up, meaning that regardless of how many tabs you have open, you can only be in line one time per browser. Savvy fans who have been burned before might get in line a few times, by opening the event in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. They might even get in line on their phone, too. Big ticket brokers, meanwhile, pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to use one of three different broker-specific web browsers that are designed to help get through virtual waiting rooms quickly. These browsers, called Insomniac, Private Tabs, and KPX, are programmed so that each tab is a different session. This means brokers can enter the virtual waiting room hundreds or thousands of times. “Every tab contains its own unique clean IP,” Private Tabs advertises. Insomniac offers a “Century View” where hundreds of tabs can be monitored at a time. Private Tabs costs $500 per month. Insomniac costs $400 per month. KPX, a new browser, costs $40 per month. These browsers have additional features that automate the ticket buying process or make it easy to handle a variety of situations that anyone buying tickets will face. Private Tabs lets scalpers get SMS codes directly in the browser, lets them set “location-based IP addresses” per tab (Ticketmaster sometimes allows people who are geographically close into the waiting room first), and has various autofill options for scalpers. In a promotional video, the creator of Private Tabs says that “if you have like, eight monitors,” the browser will let scalpers monitor waiting rooms in all eight of them. “Most of our customers gross OVER 1 MILLION IN SALES their first year using our WEB BROWSER tools!,” Private Tabs advertises. “300k+ Waiting Rooms Passed,” KPX advertises. Average fans do not pay for browsers like this. Selling Tickets Before They Go On Sale Yesterday, my mom forwarded me an email: “Olivia Rodrigo GUTS Tour: Tickets On Sale Now!,” the email, which came from a secondary market ticketing platform called Box Office Ticket Sales, said. My mom asked me: “How can they be selling these if they don’t go on sale until tomorrow?” The answer is that scalpers regularly sell tickets they don’t have, or that aren’t even on sale yet. Ticket resale sites regularly let brokers “substitute” tickets that are better than the ones they originally sold, so scalpers will list tickets that they don’t have at astronomical prices, hope they sell them, then try to buy tickets that are similar to the ones they sold for less than the price they sold them for. So, this is gambling, but it can often work as arbitrage. There are broker services that will look for inefficiencies in the market; brokers often will list tickets for a high price, sell them, then use software to automatically buy the tickets from another service for less money, pulling a profit along the way.

Of the practices I mentioned here, this one is maybe the least problematic, but it’s normal for fans (or their parents) to Google something like “Olivia Rodrigo tickets,” and have most of the results be ads that link to secondary platforms rather than Ticketmaster. Lots of sales are made to people who don’t realize that they’re buying tickets for more than face value from a random secondary ticketing market rather than the primary seller. Box Office Ticket Sales has a popup on Olivia Rodrigo tickets that says “ALERT: Tickets for this event are in high demand. Get yours today before they’re gone!” Many of the tickets listed are for “Zone Seating.” “The tickets you receive may be in the specific section listed here or in an equivalent or better location. This listing describes tickets that the seller does not own or may not know the exact location of the seats, but is offering to obtain for you,” the site says. To its credit, the site also says “As a resale marketplace, prices may be above face value” and also says “we are a resale marketplace, not the ticket seller.” As I’ve tried to point out in my reporting over the years, scalpers and Ticketmaster are engaged in a neverending game of cat-and-mouse, but the more difficult Ticketmaster ostensibly makes it to buy tickets, the easier it is for dedicated professionals to buy them while fans are left disappointed.

If a reseller buys the ticket, and then sells it again to the end user, Ticketmaster gets paid twice.This point results in at least hundreds of millions in revenue. Now, if one of the platforms “cracks down” and makes it harder to buy and sell people will prefer another platform.So platforms have a huge disincentive to do anything about resellers.Also…more obviously, demand pressure drives the price, so scalpers are helping create a market and getting paid for it. reply johnnyanmac 10 hours agoparent>if one of the platforms “cracks down” and makes it harder to buy and sell people will prefer another platform.1) what other platform? I&#x27;m not too intimate with this, but part of the revolt over the Taylor Swift contrversy came from how Ticketmaster as exclusive use to most of the big venues. That seems to be the other half of the issue not talked about in this article.2) I thought this issue would be as simple as banning resales, but after reading the kind of tech (and money they pay) to invest in the scalping... idk. It&#x27;d kill off the casual scalping of someone who buys maybe a half dozen tickets. people paying hundreds for fake numbers and specialized browsers won&#x27;t be deterred. And the demand for the tickets comes from the celebrities, so it&#x27;s a pretty safe market as long as the concert industry stays up (so, no more COVID. Even then, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s hard to pull out). reply arcticbull 7 hours agorootparentYup, TicketMaster&#x2F;Live Nation is fully vertically integrated. They own venues, they manage artists, they sell merch - and yes they run the ticket platforms. The contracts basically require everything to stay in the family. reply WhyNotHugo 4 hours agorootparentSounds like theres a lot of missing legislation. The situation creates a huge conflict of interests.Then again, scalping itself out to be illegal; it’s just a form of exploiting someone else’s work to extract money from average folk without creating any value or meaningful work. reply iambateman 56 minutes agorootparentScalping is exploitative and should be illegal when it’s for water and gasoline in a hurricane recovery zone.I’m unconvinced that there is a harm when the scalping is for section 102 row 14 seat 11 at a OneDirection concert.Lots of people want to vacation in Ibiza, so it’s expensive. Lots of people want to sit in section 102 row 14 seat 11, so it’s expensive too.Just because someone with more money buys the seat doesn’t mean the person with less money was exploited. If that were the case, we must require all seats to be sold at the exact same price across the stadium and that price must be low enough for even the poorest person to attend. reply TeMPOraL 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m honestly not sure anymore if scalping should be delegalized. I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that it&#x27;s only the problem because everyone is in on it, with artists using scalpers as \"heat sinks\", to get more money while pretending they&#x27;re the victim, and everyone is well compensated for the role they play in the scheme. If that&#x27;s the case, then the entire structure is the problem, and it starts with artists exploiting the audience looking for moral&#x2F;spiritual role models. reply Fatnino 5 hours agorootparentprevSeems to me they could ban resales by making there be a name attached to each ticket. Just like the airlines. You need ID matching your ticket to get into the venue.No more scalpers. reply jallen_dot_dev 10 hours agoparentprev> If a reseller buys the ticket, and then sells it again to the end user, Ticketmaster gets paid twice.So basically scalpers are being paid to be the scapegoat so Ticketmaster can make more money, at the expense of artists and fans. reply lolinder 8 hours agorootparentAnd in turn Ticketmaster is the scapegoat that shields the artists from blame. The primary service that Ticketmaster provides is to protect the artist&#x27;s reputation while ensuring as much money as possible gets made per event. reply bernawil 2 hours agorootparentThis take is widespread and it&#x27;s just wrong. Most artists are hired by organizers and just paid a flat fee for performing, the company then selling and promoting the event. Can you imagine what it&#x27;d take to organize an international tour otherwise? Some huge names may also run their own operation (Pearl Jam where notorious for this) but still just some of the time, they&#x27;ll still do some shows in festivals or different countries where they are just hired to perform and not selli ng tickets themselves. reply gnicholas 8 hours agorootparentprevBut don’t artists get less because scalping happens? That is, if they priced tickets higher to start, there would be more revenue going to the artists and less going to middlemen. reply bdw5204 7 hours agorootparentRaising the face value of the tickets would eliminate scalpers but at the expense of reputation. That&#x27;s why Sony and Microsoft didn&#x27;t just raise the cost of the PS5 and Xbox Series X during the 2 years or so when they were sold out everywhere and only available through scalpers or if you were lucky enough to buy one at face value.People look at high prices as \"the seller is just greedy\" even if they&#x27;re arguably justified by the demand. If you can just relist those Taylor Swift tickets you bought at face value on Ticketmaster, they are \"sold\" as far as Swift herself and her record label are concerned but Ticketmaster can make extra money and presumably pays a kickback to Swift and her label. If she ceases to be the \"current thing\" and demand massively drops for her concerts to the point that face value is overpriced, the scalpers are left with the losses.Sometimes scalpers do lose money. Anybody who thought Playstation VR2 was going to be high demand like the PS5 lost a ton of money getting rid of that thing below face value. Likewise, if you try to scalp tickets to an Inter Miami game on the assumption that Messi is going to be playing and it comes out that he actually won&#x27;t be because he got hurt playing the last place team on the Wednesday before a Sunday game[0], you&#x27;re the one who ends up losing money from the unsold ticket not the soccer teams. Which is why nobody selling high demand goods or services really cares that much about stopping scalping.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;sport&#x2F;football&#x2F;article-12546567&#x2F;... reply badpun 7 hours agorootparent> Raising the face value of the tickets would eliminate scalpers but at the expense of reputation.They could rise the face value, but sell the first say 80% tickets at considerable discount (so that the price matches what the ticket costs today).

They find ways to milk the show for more money than fans think is fair and keep a chunk of that extra cash as their fee, which from the artists&#x27; perspective is well-earned. Ticketmaster gets the blame for the scalpers and fees, the artist stays clean, and everyone makes more money than they would have if there was no one willing to be the bad guy.You blame Ticketmaster for the double-dipping because that&#x27;s what the artists are paying them for: to take the blame. reply Retric 22 minutes agorootparentThat’s a common theory, but artists like Taylor Swift are willing to take the blame and avoid Ticketmaster.Ticketmaster has a monopoly position and is exercising monopoly power here. replyrs999gti 12 hours agoparentprevSimple fix then, ban reselling.The artist and TM still get the revenue, but the scalper gets inventory they can&#x27;t move.What about the fans?Similar to airlines, let people buy standby tickets, at the event, check attendance, if there is space let the stand bys in.

The enjoyment of attendees can be partly dependent on the enthusiasm of other attendees. Consider the extremes: an audience entirely comprised of people who hardly know the artist, but can afford it Vs an audience comprised of only die-hard fans, irrespective of their ability to afford a ticket.

A simple desire by the artist to make their show available to a cross-section of society (this could be viewed as altruistic, since most other products&#x2F;services don&#x27;t usually offer the same thing at a lower price just to help those who can&#x27;t afford it).A possible solution to problem 1: If the goal is to ensure that only die-hard fans get the tickets, why not use their spotify&#x2F;apple music&#x2F;other histories to work out who&#x27;s really a fan of that artist?

I can only get tickets to shows there through Ticketmaster.Artists hate Ticketmaster too (some have sued them) but if you want to do an arena tour, good luck avoiding them. Artists use them because they don&#x27;t have a choice. The number of large venues that don&#x27;t use TM is growing, my local basketball arena uses SeatGeek.The one concession TM makes is to their fan clubs.

Various people in the thread have claimed that they do, that they&#x27;re receiving kickbacks from scalping or a portion of Ticketmaster fees on resales, but your parent comment claims that this is not the case and misrepresents the ticket sale structure.I think that&#x27;s a critical difference, because if the current situation is actually a big reputation laundering scam by artists, there&#x27;s not much we can do about it without regulation. If it&#x27;s not, if in fact most artists are as unhappy about the situation as their fans, there&#x27;s quite a lot they can do about it and should be encouraged to do so even if it makes getting a ticket significantly harder (e.g. showing ID for purchased tickets at the venue and only allowing 1:1 refunds, not resales of tickets).Of course, if producers are receiving a significant portion of earnings on resales, some of that does \"trickle down\" to artists in the form of higher performing fees on the basis of anticipated resales. But that&#x27;s a small fraction of added value for most artists, and it&#x27;s coming at a level of indirection that means ticket sellers are incentivized to raise fees to their highest possible levels after artists get paid, because that&#x27;s pure profit for them. I think it&#x27;s entirely reasonable to believe that artists aren&#x27;t happy about this payment structure, even if they do see slightly higher show income as a result, and want a range of fans to be able to attend their shows. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentI understood there is no difference between what the comment I replied to is describing and what its parent is, because of the (brought by others elsewhere in the thread) fungibility of money. Whether the artists get their cut directly, or just enjoy cheaper venues because Ticketmaster happens to be owned by the same party that owns the venue, that&#x27;s literally the same benefit - just instead of being paid directly, the artists get their expenses covered. That&#x27;s my understanding of what&#x27;s going on with plenty of those deals. reply mattmaroon 1 hour agorootparentArtists don’t pay for venues, promoters do, so they’re not cheaper, but your point that Ticketmaster has more revenue (and thus more to pay the artist) so they may get paid more indirectly is valid. But also, Ticketmaster has a monopsony. Or nearly so. One might argue (and many artists have ) that the artists would get paid more if there were a market for their tour rather than one company owning the vast majority of large venues.The only things I’m sure of are that A. consumers would benefit if there was an actual market and B.

Ticketmaster also sign deals with other promoters to be their exclusive ticket outlet, so even in instances where LiveNation isn&#x27;t the promoter, you may have to deal with TM. reply TylerE 15 hours agorootparentprevJust like the job of every sports league president isn’t to keep the fans (or the players) happy.

Because money is fungible it doesn&#x27;t really matter if they pay the artist, or if they pay for the artist&#x27;s expenses.What matters is how much fees they charge and how much do they keep. Can&#x27;t find it right now, but I remember an article claiming they rarely keep 50% of their fees. reply bluehatbrit 14 hours agorootparentGenerally there&#x27;s a promoter in the middle. They sign the artist and then have a deal signed with their ticketing partner. They&#x27;ll then sign contracts with venues for the given tour. The contracts between promoters and ticketing agencies vary a lot depending on the country but that&#x27;s how it often works in the states.The \"face value\" (base price) will usually be determined between the artist and promoter, the venue will apply a fairly generic fee on top, as will the ticketing provider.How much of the face value goes to the artist will depend on their leverage in the contract with their promoter. This is usually best improved by the confidence that the venue will sell out, meaning artists with bigger audience and social media presence will usually get the best terms.I don&#x27;t have a paper or article I can link to as a source, but I have experience in the industry. reply hackeraccount 20 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t have a source but I&#x27;ve read the same thing; that a lot of what ticket master takes in is getting bounced around. It&#x27;s a view I find very plausible intuitively.

With the recent Taylor Swift fiasco, if she charged $2k a ticket, she would be viewed as some nightmare of capitalism. Instead, she gets to hide under the guise of ticketmaster since she sold tickets at a lower dollar cost only to be resold at a market clearing price. I have anecdata to say some people won the initial lottery and paid a few hundred for floor seats when the large majority needed to pay the market clearing price on the secondary market.

For one extreme, a Grateful Dead show was basically a mini festival with one act. The crowd before, after and during is an integral part of the experience. Empty seats don’t tell others about the event or participate with the other ticket holders, degrading the value for artists and many concert-goers.So, a Dead show that sells just a few hundred many-many-thousand-dollar tickets might sit on a maximum supply &#x2F; demand curve for the venue or scalpers just looking at ticket revenue, but could destroy much of the value of the event for the band and it’s everyday fans who want the event experience and want it for as many people as possible. reply rtpg 11 hours agoparentprevBecause while the point is to make money, the point is not to maximize the earnings for tours.

It’s a market that should be regulated, as the ticket platform has an incentive to optimize their own self-dealing.

I think the artist just like the idea of the tickets being affordable to allow their younger and less well off fans access.I think any argument here has to acknowledge the artists rights in this.

A venue or artist cannot legally institute policies or practices to prohibit resale.Even if resale were prohibited or technically impossible, it will not necessarily be any easier to get tickets to a high demand event as resale is only a factor when an event has enough demand to sell out far in advance of playing. reply hedora 14 hours agorootparentResale is prohibited for (some?) ticketmaster events, unless you resell through Ticketmaster, allowing them to double-dip on the transaction fee.So, it would be hard for them to make the argument you are making.

Captchas for something worth 1&#x2F;10th of a cent. Phone number verification for something worth $0.1-$1. Real-world presence and real-world id checks for things worth $100.The amount of money you can make scalping tickets is way higher than that, so it&#x27;s not a useful defense. Doubly so when the cost of the phone verification isn&#x27;t even per-transaction, but once per account.For the ticketmaster case, I think what you&#x27;d want is some kind of proof of stable liveness at every transaction. It&#x27;s easy enough to game proof of liveness, or proof of unique identity, at account creation time. Just the classic method of paying people at a parking lot $5 to pass a \"wave to the webcam\" captcha. But they can&#x27;t get those same people back for another captcha every time they want to use that account for another ticket. (Though it&#x27;s possible that deepfakes have rendered webcam captchas effectively worthless in the last year or two, I don&#x27;t know where the state of the art on deepfake detection for this kind of usecase is.) reply kmeisthax 21 hours agoparentprevThe problem is that we&#x27;re not testing for human-ness, we&#x27;re testing for uniqueness. What we want is a button that, when pressed by a particular person, gives them one ticket, and then stops giving them tickets. This requires positive identification of each person buying tickets, which means spending lots of money to prevent people from obtaining multiple identifications.I suspect verifying government IDs would be a viable uniqueness criterion, except the only thing those IDs can buy you is voting rights in a particular country, which are usually worthless, so these systems aren&#x27;t attacked. Now imagine if we decided that Taylor Swift ticket purchases had to be verified with ID. You could see, say, a particular country in the global south deciding they&#x27;re going to just invent people on paper to go buy Taylor Swift tickets specifically so they can scalp them on the open market.The underlying problem is that so long as a particular economic opportunity exists, whoever is trusted to stop that opportunity from being exploited has an incentive to stab you in the back. Mobile network operators were never intended to be a 2FA code delivery system or Sybil resistance system, so they will totally just let people SIM-swap you or sell numbers in bulk to spammers, because not doing so was never in their job description and their business is not built to defend against such things. reply carlosjobim 12 hours agorootparentThe ID is for showing when you enter the venue to enjoy the show. When purchasing you just need to give your name. reply danaris 21 hours agorootparentprevAt least in the US, a government-issued IDa) is not required to vote in many places (and pushing for that requirement is, in fact, one of the major methods of classist&#x2F;racist voter suppression), andb) is required to do various other things, like purchase alcohol, drive, or buy plane tickets.Due to (b), there is already a thriving black market in fake IDs for various reasons, and of various qualities.Government-issued ID systems are absolutely attacked, fairly aggressively. reply hedora 15 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure they do this so they can sell your personal information.I avoid them whenever possible, but I recently bought a ticket for an event weeks after they went on sale (there was essentially no activity on the map of available tickets that day).They \"unknown error\"&#x27;ed me at the end of the purchase flow (inside their reservation timeout window). 60 seconds later, the tickets I had tried to purchase were being resold by a scalper.So, whatever their API is, it allows scalpers to get a feed of tickets that are in the middle of being purchased, then to buy them in the reservation window and offer them for resale with super human speed.That company is clearly run by crooks. They&#x27;ve repeatedly been brought under investigation for exactly this behavior (for over a decade), so presumably, they are also good at paying out bribes. reply thfuran 21 hours agoparentprevSMS are plaintext that can be obtained via web API. It seems on the face of it to be just about the least effective possible means of verifying human-ness. reply AnthonyMouse 19 hours agorootparentThe reason SMS verification is popular isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s effective against sybil attacks. It&#x27;s not. You can get access to phone numbers in bulk for little money.It&#x27;s because most honest users only have one phone number, which makes it a useful unique ID for tracking the honest users. Anyone using it should immediately be under suspicion of selling you out. reply costco 13 hours agorootparentWell, I mean there&#x27;s no way I can prove this but I think it has more to do with the fact that compared to email verification ($0.002&#x2F;hotmail address), CAPTCHA ($0.003&#x2F;reCAPTCHA), it substantially raises account creation costs because real US&#x2F;EU phone numbers will be at least a couple cents per verification. reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparentThere are a bunch of services that put any SMS received by a bunch of phone numbers on a public website, and they change the phone numbers all the time. You can go to any one of them and use it to create an account for free.Of course, this is another reason why the practice is harmful -- legitimate users with a legitimate desire to be anonymous will do this, and then if you use the number provided for account recovery, someone can steal their account after the number gets recycled. (This also happens to normies when people change their phone number and don&#x27;t update it with your service; don&#x27;t use phone numbers for password recovery. The near-100% probability of being reissued is a disaster.)But what happens at scale, for actual wholesale-level spammers? They get a contact with a phone carrier who lets them use all their unissued numbers. They operate one of these public SMS websites, which not only doesn&#x27;t cost them money but turns a small profit because of the ad revenue. They do the same thing, but privately, and sell the availability of thousands of phone numbers to other spammers. Then they resell the SIMs to recover the money because they never actually used any of the prepaid data. Which makes offering the service to other spammers cheap, which keeps the price low if you want to be a buyer instead of a seller. The more people who try to do this on their service, the better this scales, because the customer base increases.It&#x27;s just not meant for this and the inconvenience and privacy invasion to legitimate users is unreasonable. reply acheong08 15 hours agoparentprevI use smspool for non-voip numbers. Very effective. reply lifeisstillgood 6 hours agoprevSo I think Inmight have the ticket market worked out - it&#x27;s been puzzling me.So we can easily solve ticket allocation on a \"fair\" way - London 2012 olympics was a good example. Everyone who wants tickets for an event signs up and there is a (verified) random selection and the lucky winners paid (I think) a tenner.This is because there was no profit maximising incentive for the Games - it was a PR exercise for UK government.Now for a Taylor Swift concert there is profit maximising. I am going to say here it&#x27;s Taylor&#x27;s manager who is the cackling moustache twirling villain of the piece to avoid upsetting Awiftians but hear me out.Profit seeking manager arranged a contract like Katy Perry below [0]. This basically is a leak showing Perry arranged to be able to sell her own tickets to \"resellers\" - ie people she knew would sell on StubHub for higher than face value.But to protect his clients reputation he wants to keep this selling of tickets at high prices a secret.So imagine there are 1 million tickets for a tour, over 50 days at 20,000 tickets per event (no idea of this is right seems ok-ish). Then hold back 10 days (added by extra demand!) and then only sell say 50% of tickets at the low price, there are say 400,000 tickets available to fans. But release them slowly - extra demand &#x2F; seating allocation, verifies fans first etc etc. The point is to guage demand - if 1000 people try to buy tickets on day 1 for a stadium, and only 500 manage to get through the process you know there are 500 disappointed people out there so sell the other 50% for that day on that stadium to reseller (your mate) who will go on stub hub or ticket master selling to people who just missed out and will pay higher prices.finally a market that makes sense. Why is the process slow, awkward, convoluted? Because it&#x27;s a signalling mechanism for reselling you higher priced tickets without affecting the reputation of the client[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vulture.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;katy_perry_reserves_the_righ... reply chevman 21 hours agoprevProtip I&#x27;ve used the last couple years (worked before that as well, but not as much need) - just check StubHub or other second hand markets a week or so before the show.Generally the scalpers over buy and will start to panic and unload tickets at very good prices the closer the show gets. reply crazygringo 21 hours agoparentThis is not true at all as a general rule.It all comes down to whether or not there&#x27;s enough demand to fill the venue.If there&#x27;s plenty of demand, StubHub prices will remain much higher than face value. They absolutely do not ever become available at good prices.On the other hand, if the venue is larger than demand, then yes -- you can easily score half-price tickets a few days leading up to the show.But good luck trying to figure out which one will be the outcome. If you delay purchasing, prices are just as likely to keep going up as they are to go down. reply kelnos 15 hours agorootparentI guess this sort of advice is good for the kind of person who sees a show coming up, and thinks it would be cool to go, but is completely fine missing it if the price isn&#x27;t on the lower end. reply Symbiote 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also less practical for people with less flexible jobs, who might need to book time off work or plan their shifts to go to a show. reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentprevYes if it&#x27;s a large&#x2F;unlimited capacity venue this is a good approach. I was at an outdoor festival recently and people were basically giving away tickets on the day of the show. reply codelikeawolf 15 hours agoprevI quickly scanned the article, so I might have missed this, but can someone explain how sites like StubHub get away with what they do? As soon as I found out about them, I immediately thought \"aren&#x27;t these people just scalpers that offer tickets on the internet instead of standing out in front of venues?\" If the argument is that they&#x27;re not scalpers, they&#x27;re resellers, then I&#x27;d like to try selling some concert tickets in a parking lot and see what happens if I made the same claim. reply bombcar 15 hours agoparentThey started out as plain scalper marketplaces but now have deals with most venues to give the venue a cut. reply autoexec 14 hours agorootparentSo venues take bribes in the from of kickbacks to look the other way when stubhub commits illegal acts? or does stubhub not operate in states where scalping tickets is a crime? reply Kamq 13 hours agorootparent> to look the other way when stubhub commits illegal acts?Scalping is only illegal in certain jurisdictions (usually state level, iirc). Presumably stubhub intentionally does not operate in those jurisdictions.They could sell to people in those jurisdictions, but you could make people sign a thing saying that they actually bought the tickets from another area. Someone could probably come after them, but there&#x27;s enough plausible deniability to keep it tied up in court for a while, and nobody is going to do that for low level scalping offenses. reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentprevThey probably specifically have deals with the venues to make it not technically scalping, somehow. reply conductr 13 hours agoparentprevJust a theory, and I only scanned the article too, but I think they’ve all learned that this aftermarket stuff is good for their business. At least now that things are digital and have fees attached, because they make money whenever tickets change hands. They get to claim it’s a service as they’re providing liquidity to the market. reply TylerE 15 hours agoparentprevScalping is legal in most jurisdictions, sometimes with restrictions (“no selling within 1000ft of the venue for more than 20% over face”. reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentAs it should be, without restrictions. Basically First Sale doctrine. If I buy something, I own it and should be able to sell it at market price. reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentThe First Sale doctrine is fine, hoarding (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hoarding_(economics)) and price gouging not so much. Rights come with responsibilities. Maybe I can buy up a pallet of toilet paper in the middle of a pandemic, but people would be right to think I was a total piece of shit if I did.Society&#x27;s tolerance for parasites who do that kind of thing has a breaking point and when the people being negatively impacted get fed up enough to take action I&#x27;ll have no sympathy for anyone who seeks to make others miserable just so that they can profit off of their suffering. reply kortilla 12 hours agorootparentThat’s the sophomoric take. The only reason you had the opportunity to buy a pallet during a shortage in the first place is due to idiotic “price gouging” laws.During the pandemic the price of toilet paper should have been increased by an order of magnitude at the store level. This would prevent hoarding and it would make sure people who desperately wanted it could get it. Additionally, it would have incentivized producers and sellers to fill demand.Price controls are the equivalent of rations. They don’t solve anything because they remove all of the incentives. reply autoexec 12 hours agorootparent> and it would make sure people who desperately wanted it could get it.I fail to see how making toilet paper cost hundreds or thousands of dollars per roll would ensure that everyone who needed it would be able to get it, since many of those who desperately wanted to wipe their ass were unable to work and going into record amounts of debt just to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads.Producers and sellers were already fully incentivized to sell their goods, as they always have been. They know people want their product and will pay them enough that they can turn a profit. There&#x27;s no reason to turn toilet paper into an luxury item which only the wealthiest people can afford leaving the majority priced out.Price controls and rations have their place. Like all tools, the key to is make sure that they are used correctly. reply zone411 8 hours agorootparentprevMost economists believe that price gouging is completely fine. Anti-price gouging laws lead to a misallocation of resources and lower supply where it&#x27;s needed. reply autoexec 5 hours agorootparentIt shouldn&#x27;t surprise us that people who want to be able to exploit others for profit, or who advocate for those who do, would claim that exploiting others is somehow a virtuous act. reply losteric 14 hours agorootparentprevThe concert is the product. A ticket is one approach for artists to control access to the limited experienc, typically while maintaining substantial equity and equality of access.Of course profit maximization is not the only (or even primary) goal, that&#x27;s what makes this such a hard problem. If it were, ticket sales would be trivially solved - just auction each seat to the highest bider, close biding near the concert date and prevent any transfers. Of course that&#x27;s a terrible idea. reply driscoll42 14 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a significant difference between buying something and reselling, and then having bots buying hundreds&#x2F;thousands and reselling. reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentNot really. The demand is what it is, and the supply of tickets is fixed. That sets the price, not the number of different people selling. reply zarzavat 14 hours agorootparentOK but the tickets are going to different people. In most cases (music, sports) you want your tickets going to your best fans because the energy of the crowd improves the performance. We’re not selling wheat futures here. If the tickets instead go to rich people who may or may not show up, it could harm the event. reply codelikeawolf 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right, the future looks grim. Who knows how many layers of the reseller parfait you have to go through just to get a ticket? At some point it becomes prohibitively expensive and there won&#x27;t be enough people that can afford to attend events.I wonder how much of this could be alleviated by selling a certain percentage of tickets at the box office only? I worked in operations for a pretty large concert venue several years ago, and the Jonas Brothers were going to play there (this was at their peak). I remember a good chunk of tickets were only sold at the box office and there was a limit per person (maybe 5 or 6)? I know it&#x27;s annoying to drive somewhere and wait in line for hours, but I&#x27;m sure there are folks out there that would prefer to do that instead of paying a 500% markup on the original ticket price. reply TylerE 9 hours agorootparentIronically, tiered pricing to cut out the scalpers it exactly what got Springsteen so much blow back.The artists have simply decided to sell $1000 tickets instead of $200 tickets that get scalped for $1000 reply codelikeawolf 13 hours agorootparentprevVery true, but very annoying for the person that wants to attend the concert. You can pretty much flush your chances of getting tickets directly from Ticketmaster right down the toilet. reply qup 13 hours agorootparentprevThe price is fixed.The scalpers then create a secondary market where there is a supply and demand situation like you talk about. reply124 more comments...

A few years ago I could start two nodes in random places and copy files between them with just a little delay. These days, I&#x27;m rarely and to start the transfer, even though both sides are connected to a few peers. Has something changed? Is it due to more&#x2F;fewer people in the network? reply ranger_danger 10 hours agoparentBecause more people are using it now but the protocol itself isn&#x27;t actually suited for this level of scale; IMO it&#x27;s doomed. reply j_maffe 4 hours agorootparentDo you have any sources where I can read up on this? I&#x27;ve also heard of this complaint and I&#x27;m interested in diving into it for my thesis. Do you know what algorithms are suitable to make IPFS scalable? reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparentprevHow does that work? I would expect more nodes = more capacity for answering lookups &#x2F; spreading the DHT. Why is the result the opposite? If I start a full node it&#x27;s definitely not overwhelmed with traffic. reply dboreham 6 hours agorootparentNodes end up in unconnected islands of content knowledge. Whatever node you pick to query has a low probability of knowing about some content posted on some other random node. The workaround is to force the p2p topology to make a reachable subset of nodes that you use for both posting and querying, but that&#x27;s not too decentralized because someone has to coordinate the topology override scheme. reply Thorrez 8 hours agorootparentprevSounds like what happened to bitcoin. reply TimeBearingDown 1 hour agorootparentBitcoin was co-opted by a censorious minority - Theymos and Blockstream - who have maintained an artificially low block size, ostensibly in order to keep a high number of non-mining but full-history nodes.Bitcoin’s competitors such as Ethereum and Monero did not allow a software or discussion forum monoculture and instead have scaling block sizes, and still hard fork to add new scaling features (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethresear.ch). reply p4bl0 1 hour agoprevSo, that&#x27;s not really IPFS support in cURL. It is just a support for IPFS&#x27; urls as it actually consists in rewriting them to use a HTTP gateway, which will actually do all the IPFS work.I understand that implementing the IPFS protocol in a tool such as cURL does not make sense. But I don&#x27;t really see the point of a fake support like this. reply pests 10 hours agoprev> I have also learned that some of the IPFS gateways even do regular HTTP 30x redirects to bounce over the client to another gateway.> Meaning: not only do you use and rely a total rando’s gateway on the Internet for your traffic. That gateway might even, on its own discretion, redirect you over to another host. Possibly run somewhere else, monitored by a separate team.> I have insisted, in the PR for ipfs support to curl, that the IPFS URL handling code should not automatically follow such gateway redirectsI wonder what decision was made here. reply mastazi 10 hours agoprevOriginal source link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;curl&#x2F;curl&#x2F;pull&#x2F;8805 reply kosolam 4 hours agoprevYeah, verification is needed. A malicious gateway can be passed in via env for example. There should be another optional argument that also verifies the contents vs the hash. reply stefan_ 13 hours agoprevThis does not appear to be IPFS, it&#x27;s just some crude method of rewriting ipfs:&#x2F;&#x2F; URLs into HTTP requests to gateways that then do the actual IPFS. Which much like bitcoin, nobody seems to want to run locally despite that mostly defeating the purpose. On the bright side none of this ended up polluting libcurl. reply gcr 12 hours agoparentI’d love to see IPFS native protocol support in curl, to be honest.After all, curl already supports dozens of other obscure protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS…One challenge of doing this correctly is that curl is intended to be a “one-off” call that downloads and exits without participating in the swarm the way a good BitTorrent client should. Granted, presumably this IPFS gateway solution also has this problem. reply yjftsjthsd-h 11 hours agorootparentWell, that seems like exactly the difference: It&#x27;s not about obscurity, it&#x27;s about curl not being a daemon and therefore a poor fit for p2p protocols. reply 1letterunixname 8 hours agorootparentPeople use ipfs to download hosted (by someone) things, so it is a fit. Have a look at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;winworldpc.comAlso, the Internet Archive uses web seeded torrents to accomplish the problem of insufficient seeds rather than throwing them into the ether (non-crypto variant) and hoping for mirroring by wishful thinking.Conclusion: Centralized, unicast-like support for p2p is possible and useful for download-oriented clients.IPFS Desktop in particular: One shitty thing they did was auto re-opt-in to telemetry without asking the user. With that kind of sneaky bullshit, I refuse to run it. IPFS lost trust and is unable to communicate how their \"solution\" is useful or make it usable by humans who aren&#x27;t IPFS Desktop developers. reply duskwuff 6 hours agorootparentI feel like you&#x27;re missing the point here.P2P protocols like IPFS are built with the expectation that clients are persistent. They take a nontrivial amount of time to start up (e.g. to discover peers), and require continuous maintenance from the application to keep running (e.g. to chat with those peers and keep them happy).These characteristics are incompatible with clients like curl. They&#x27;re written with the expectation that connection setup is cheap and that connections don&#x27;t require maintenance while they aren&#x27;t being used. These expectations are all true of existing protocols like HTTP(S) or FTP; they fail with IPFS. And there isn&#x27;t really any way to solve that without introducing another process to act as an intermediary -- which is exactly what an IPFS gateway does. reply mburns 6 hours agorootparentNot really, a transient ipfs node works just fine.There are stable nodes to bootstrap a new node into the network. More initialization that if you were using http, sure, but it isn’t as against the grain as you suggest.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ipfs&#x2F;ipget reply 1letterunixname 8 hours agorootparentprevYour mischaracterization of HTTPS as obscure is baffling.

You already could! reply gcr 12 hours agorootparentHonestly, I agree. This is not IPFS support, this is “we ship with a default URL rewriting rule and then make an HTTP call”It’s a first step, thoughAt least the rule is invoked safely.

If curl does have something analogous, this change would allow html of the form: to be handled transparently (even when it occurs in a page that is not itself on IPFS).

When they ask me a question about someone I encourage them to ask the person. When the want something I encourage them to ask (respectfully). They always, always get nice responses and I get friendly conversations afterwards. Think of yourself, how would you react? Well 99.999 of people would react the same. reply catiopatio 13 hours agoparentI would react politely to your children and, if further engaged by you, continue to converse with you politely.I would also genuinely, deeply, and silently dislike every second of the forced interaction.99.999% of people might react the same, but that doesn’t mean we all feel the same. reply giardini 9 hours agorootparentcatiopatio says:>\"I would also genuinely, deeply, and silently dislike every second of the forced interaction.\" Density is attractive to individuals who want to exploit as many other people as efficiently as possible.> For example, in the downtown areas of Canada&#x27;s densest cities, before smartphones, about 90-95% of random strangers coming up to me wanted money either as beggars or seeking donations for some \"charity\". The other 5-10% would generally be asking for directions or the time.That&#x27;s selection bias.You are interacting with the most desperate, entrepreneurial, and lost people, who are not a random and unbiased sample of the whole city. reply jerry1979 13 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn&#x27;t really explain the PNW social freeze in places like Bellingham tho. reply mdorazio 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat part of Austin are you in? I unfortunately moved to the yuppie part of east 6th and it’s decidedly less friendly than other places I’ve lived. reply jwells89 12 hours agorootparentprevDensity is a factor in this for sure, but I think weather&#x2F;climate is also a factor. It gets cold in Boston in the winter for example, and in the PNW it&#x27;s raining and on the cooler side for a good chunk of the year. In those climates people tend to want to get back indoors quickly and not loiter around, and that carries over even into the warmer months. reply kasey_junk 13 minutes agorootparentTry going to Minnesota or Wisconsin. People are extremely friendly and want to chat. It’s almost a cliche.I think it’s something other than weather. reply Klonoar 18 hours agoparentprevThe PNW can get to talking eventually but it’s like pulling teeth before it catches.Maybe a better analogy is starting a lawnmower. reply dieselgate 17 hours agorootparentI’m inthe PNW and feel this is largely situation dependent. Was camping in Oregon last weekend and was surprised by how many different groups of campers were conversing at length with one another. When on&#x2F;around my boat at the marina it’s common for folks to chat openly.In my neighborhood it’s very much the opposite and there’s little&#x2F;no eye contact and chatter. reply ptmcc 17 hours agorootparentSocialization in the PNW is highly hobby&#x2F;activity oriented. It&#x27;s immediate common ground and usually a recreational context.Day to day is more much reserved and insular as we go about our business. reply wrp 10 hours agorootparentGrowing up in Oregon, it&#x27;s just the way it was that we socialized with people we met through work&#x2F;church&#x2F;school&#x2F;hobby, but not neighbors. I&#x27;ve lived next door to people for decades and not even met them face-to-face.Many years ago, I was riding on a nearly empty city bus. A guy got on and sat not too far away. After a bit, he looked my way and sidled over to be in conversation distance and said, \"Excuse, I moved here from Florida about two months ago. Nobody here will talk to me, and I&#x27;m starting to go crazy. Is there something wrong with me?\" reply hackermatic 16 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed, too -- even casual trail walkers are much more likely to greet you and smile. reply LordShredda 14 hours agorootparentprevIs that why most advice you see online is to go rock climbing or hiking to meet friends? reply dieselgate 14 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s PNW specific where that&#x27;s true but in my experience those types of things are great ways to meet people and build social relationships. It could also be through any other sort of recurring activity like friday night magic or a local code meetup etc.Edit: the downside of this, in my experience as well, is getting pigeon-holed in some activity with others. Especially when something like alcohol is involved reply gwright 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve found that campers&#x2F;hikers anywhere are generally very approachable. reply dieselgate 15 hours agorootparentFor sure, one of the best parts to me about being in a National park for example is how happy and stoked on life everyone is reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agorootparentprevBecause every one knows they&#x27;ll never have to see each other again. reply morserer 7 hours agorootparentIt might be a factor, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the main reason. If you&#x27;re an outdoorsy type, you have that immediate common ground with fellow campers, and have a whole host of starter questions pertaining to that interest that will usually kickstart an entire conversation. Same with the marina-goers: boats are an interest that you can start a convo with. Makes it easy. reply dieselgate 13 hours agorootparentprevFunny this is mentioned and maybe there&#x27;s some truth to it. One thing that struck me about the culture from an extended trip to Mexico City a few years ago is how often people say \"hasta luego\"&#x2F;\"see you later\" for transactions - even if they&#x27;re total strangers. I found it very warming and a contrast to where I&#x27;m from. It makes sense as a farewell but think people take it more literally - to the point where people have responded \"uh not really\" to my own \"see you later\".One of the funniest lines of Dumb and Dumber to me is \"well big gulps eh, see you later!\" [1][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=N_j5tDuakKU reply Klonoar 16 hours agorootparentprevThe replies to this comment illustrated it well, but yes, I would agree in general.

You can make it work, but it winds up being more work than is ideal. reply sweettea 11 hours agorootparentprevI have never experienced talking to a stranger at a bar - one goes with ones friends, and gets to know them better, but nobody known to nobody ever gets added to the conversation. reply kasey_junk 8 minutes agorootparentWhat?

If a stranger tries to talk to me I have to give an ocular pat down and risk assessment before engaging beyond a skeptical glance. reply ekidd 16 hours agorootparent> No one is friendly in urban areasYes, this is mostly an urban&#x2F;rural divide. I&#x27;ve lived in several small New England towns where people talk to each other in public all the time.But I&#x27;ve also lived in Boston. And I&#x27;ve learned that if a stranger strikes up a conversation in Boston, there are two possibilities:1. They need directions or emergency aid.2. Or they have absolutely no grasp of appropriate social norms, and I am about to have a deeply weird conversation. At best.In theory, I am perfectly happy to speak with strangers on the subway.

It&#x27;s a natural place to end up in a scenario where you could chat with someone for a decently long time if you both choose to do so. A takeaway I always remind myself is that you never know what&#x27;s right next to you.Last month someone asked me which track the train leaves from. I answered and that turned into chatting with someone from Lebanon visiting the US who was nearing the completion of their PhD in theoretical physics mixed with quantum computing. Out of no where a 90 minute conversation ensued around programming, life in different countries and a bunch of other assorted topics. reply partytax 14 hours agoparentCan confirm that trains are an amazing place to meet people. I commute on the Amtrak Northeast Regional and have made 3 regular acquaintances with whom I&#x27;ve had long conversations.Never would have happened on a plane or or on the highway. reply JustAPerson 15 hours agoprevI’ve spent years of therapy trying to overcome my fear of talking to strangers. Mostly it just feels inappropriate and unwanted; like I would be intruding on people. I can talk to strangers when there’s an appropriate social context (e.g. clerks &#x2F; service people). But lacking the right context, it feels deeply uncomfortable.Has anyone overcome this problem? Where would you go to interact with strangers–importantly where there’s an appropriate social context that permits interacting. reply morserer 6 hours agoparentHi! I did. This is what worked for me.First: Work a job that is socially embedded. Restaurants, grocery stores, front desk retail, anything customer service related. Getting comfortable with people has a weird out-of-order solution where if your discomfort is visible, the interaction will sour; find something that forces a fix to the initial discomfort, like the jobs above. They&#x27;ll act as a shim that&#x27;ll let you bypass the initial anxiety.Second: The emotions you wear on your face are what perpetuates a conversation. If you can find a reason--not act, not fake--to want to talk to someone, to learn about them, they will immediately, unconsciously pick up on it, and return that excitement. Conversely, if you don&#x27;t trust someone, or think they don&#x27;t want to talk to you, they wont want to talk to you, and they won&#x27;t find you trustworthy, either. It&#x27;s a counterinruitive, ready-fire-aim thing. You don&#x27;t need to be perfect at this, you just need to be aware of it. People are excellent at vetting intentions.Third: The idea that there&#x27;s somewhere you can go that will make socialization easy is a farce. Interaction is \"permitted\" everywhere, and you can try it anywhere. Go for several short conversations instead of putting all your effort into one. You should be fishing for enthusiasm: if you get no effort back, then it is unwanted. Drop it and try again with someone else. reply jancsika 13 hours agoparentprevGo work retail somewhere that doesn&#x27;t try to hard-sell people.Most places will start by giving you some training materials on how to initiate friendly, non-threatening interactions with the customers. These are basically to burn some non-business cycles with the customer to prove that you&#x27;re not trying to hard-sell them by using aggressive and manipulative techniques on them[1].There are a lot of open-ended, safe topics you&#x27;ll use for this. But once you get comfortable with the technique, you&#x27;ll realize that you could use almost any question. Even rather specific ones like, \"What&#x27;s your favorite sandwich\" can start a perfectly fine conversation with someone. Most people like new, unpredictable utterances and as long as you present it as non-threatening it can lead to a fruitful conversation.Along with this you&#x27;ll learn to time your speech to provide plenty of spaces where your interlocutor can cut away if they so wish. E.g., if you&#x27;ve told 3 pithy little stories which were each less than 15 seconds, they will feel at ease staying for one more before they go away. If on the other hand they aren&#x27;t able to predict whether your next story is going to be a fun 10 seconds or an excruciatingly dull 5 minute rabbit hole, things are going to get awkward real quick.Finally, if you don&#x27;t listen you won&#x27;t sell shit so you will have a nice daily scorecard on your progress.1: It&#x27;s amazing how well this works. Hard-selling commissions must be so razor thin that the salespeople can&#x27;t even spend 30 seconds to build normal rapport with another human being. I&#x27;ve literally never had the experience of an employee starting out as a human being and then pivoting to aggressive&#x2F;manipulative tactics. But maybe all the salespeople who excel at that are employed by big pharma and since I&#x27;m not a doctor I don&#x27;t have contact with them. reply no_butterscotch 9 hours agoparentprevHonest Q:What kind of therapy do you look for for things like this? As someone deeply inverted, prone to \"creatively interpreting\" things in a negative light, who dwells on imagined sleights, etc. I&#x27;ve thought maybe I need some professional help.

It’s awkward for everyone, but you can make it less awkward for others by just being friendly.. complimenting someone, or even just asking a simple question to get some engagement.As long as you are respectful, friendly, and not pushy, everyone will respect you back.Try to find some local gatherings in your own community, maybe a church potluck (they won’t care if you’re not religious, they are just happy you are there) .. maybe a local game shop has some DND evenings, or just find something that aligns with your personal interests.To improve your nervousness about speaking, toastmasters or a Dale Carnegie class are both good options as well. reply xchip 11 hours agoparentprevI also feel awkward when a situation is new to me, keep repeating talking to strangers until you became used to it, that is how it works, that is how we make horses be calm and not freak out when they see plastic bags. reply Invictus0 14 hours agoparentprevLove yourself first.Love yourself first. If you truly believe that you have value;that when you open your mouth and speak to others, you brighten their day;that when other people meet you, they are happier or smarter than they were before they met you;then it is your natural obligation to talk to other people (don&#x27;t dehumanize them by calling them strangers), because you are giving them the gift of your own special human light. reply jiggawatts 13 hours agorootparentI randomly said \"Hi\" and chatted very briefly about my kid and the apartment to a random young woman in the elevator. On the way out she literally did a little hop and a skip and in a chirpy tone she said \"Yay! Interaction!\"I realised that after the COVID lockdowns people were so starved for contact with other people that any interaction would make their day.

And as a result, he knew everyone. He used to drive me absolutely crazy whenever we&#x27;d go out because no matter where we went, he&#x27;d bump into someone and wind up in a 30 minute chat.But as an adult I realized it was hugely important for my own social skills to witness and get pulled into those conversations.I&#x27;m an introvert (I take after my mother in this respect), but I think I&#x27;m a pretty decent small talker, and since my own kids have started getting bigger I&#x27;ve been trying to make an effort to overcome the friction I feel to opening up to new people so that I can demonstrate some of what my dad did. For the most part I actually enjoy talking with people, but I do really have to push myself to get started with conversations sometimes.My wife and I actually just forced ourselves to attend a birthday party for a neighbor that we&#x27;d been invited to tonight. Our kids landed there ahead of us so our hands were forced. We ended up having a great time and got such a warm greeting from the host (sometimes it can really surprise me how happy a person is to see us, haha).tl;dr: It&#x27;s definitely worth the effort to push past the friction sometimes. reply teekert 17 hours agoparentprevFwiw I feel the same.

Just like any other (meaningful) skill, decent social skills put forth significant effects on one&#x27;s awareness of their local surroundings, and with good social skills, invaluable experiences. I&#x27;ve struggled with it for the best half of my life, and later ignored the need to take action and improve. I moved on to finding out the subtle beauty of just pulling up a conversation with a completely new person, of course our perspectives and opinions might differ, and that&#x27;s where I see the beauty and without it, the world wouldn&#x27;t have been so dynamic so I think. reply MrThoughtful 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;m always surprised that so few people on planes talk to each other.It is amazing how a talk to the person next to you on a plane can turn a boring, multiple hour long flight into a nice experience that feels way shorter. reply geewee 17 hours agoparentI imagine it&#x27;s because if the conversation is terrible you&#x27;re still stuck together for potential hours.

I think it’s ok to try, but given the context, cultural differences, legal requirement to stay in your assigned seat, it might be easy to get confused about consent. reply noduerme 18 hours agorootparentWhere is there a legal requirement to stay in your assigned seat? I&#x27;ve switched seats with people plenty of times on airplanes, or simply moved into empty rows. If you want to switch you can simply ask. (That is, if you&#x27;re not afraid to talk to strangers!) reply alwa 14 hours agorootparentDid the people who you saw do this mid-flight&#x2F;mid-unwanted-conversation, in order to escape their chatty neighbors, or was this more in the early phases of the flight when people were getting settled?When people see my seat and see that it’s better than theirs, and simply ask me for it, sometimes I cave in in the interest of being nice. It’s cool that they want a nice gift from me, but even if I say a polite “no,” it makes me feel defensive about occupying a seat that I picked for a reason, under the same rules by which they picked theirs. reply noduerme 9 hours agorootparentUsually early in a flight, and once it&#x27;s established that there are some empty seats - that is, occupying an empty one rather than asking someone to switch. Although I once got on a 12-hour red eye flight that was full, settled in and, before takeoff, had a girl a few rows in front of me come back and politely ask the man next to me if he&#x27;d switch seats with her. She didn&#x27;t like the company up there, I guess. He agreed, and she and I ended up hitting it off and sharing a hotel room at our destination. Which is admittedly a rather one-off situation...I&#x27;ve also had the opposite situation, where I was desperate to switch but couldn&#x27;t. The worst case was when I got the last seat on a flight and found myself between this completely asshole older couple where, it came out, the man would only fly in a window seat and his wife would only sit on the aisle. They bickered at each other over me for 3 hours as if I wasn&#x27;t even there, and both refused to switch with me, going so far as to claim they both got airsick if they sat in a middle seat. Obviously, it wasn&#x27;t even worth asking anyone else on the plane to switch, but I&#x27;ve never wanted to kill anyone as much. reply dmd 17 hours agorootparentprevI fly 10-15 times a year and I have seen an empty seat on a flight maybe once. reply noduerme 10 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t fly as often as you. Maybe 6-8 times a year. But I usually try to travel on days&#x2F;times&#x2F;routes that I think will be quiet. Like, if I&#x27;m going to Vegas, I&#x27;ll leave on a Tuesday night after a holiday weekend. Internationally, there used to be a lot of half-empty planes. Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t seen as many empty rows since covid constricted the industry. reply firstbabylonian 17 hours agoparentprevSomehow I feel that changed recently (post-COVID?).I remember having lots of random conversations with my seatmates on planes, and I’m not the type to talk to strangers myself.It used to be normal to always ask something along the lines of “where are you headed?” and maybe let that evolve into a chat about shared experiences about cities and places. I still remember some of the fascinating people I met this way and will never see again.But in the last couple of years all my flights have been purely transactional where not a single casual word is ever exchanged with anyone. reply jiggawatts 13 hours agoparentprevThe best conversation I ever had on a plane was with an elderly French couple. They didn&#x27;t speak English and I know maybe half a dozen words of French. They eventually successfully communicated to me that they&#x27;re taking a month-long holiday at a sort-of private island where there&#x27;s these bungalows where you can stay isolated from civilisation. No Internet, no electricity, and you have to fish for your dinner. Groceries are via a guy on a canoe that turns up once a day to sell you whatever you need.It was fascinating and amazing how with hours with nothing else to occupy us, we overcame boredom by exchanging this story despite the language barrier. reply calf 14 hours agoparentprevWhen I was in grad school, I would catch up reading journal papers on the plane and keep to myself, but finally on two separate occasions it sparked lengthy conversation, because the other person was an engineer or a mathematician. reply ip26 18 hours agoparentprevI would suggest it’s simply because flights are often much longer than a subway ride.

I would consider myself to be more asocial than average, though certainly not aggressively so. The types of sentiments expressed in this article are usually written by very social people who see conversation as some inherent good. I think you are in the minority of such social butterflies in terms of checking that assumption.For an example, take this quote:> But that is not the whole story. In mid-life and beyond people can still experience the joy of a random meeting, however short, which somehow touches a nerve.What exactly is the joy? Is that joy not something I can obtain more easily via the “traditional” social channels I’ve cultivated over the course of my life thus far? And won’t a social interaction in one of those channels have a much greater chance of lasting positive impact given that person is more likely to be someone I interact with regularly, enabling me to build off that initial interaction over time?Moreover, what’s the downside of the encounter? I suspect a lot of asocial people like myself strongly dislike the much more common awkwardness and self-doubt that accompany a social interaction that goes poorly. Is enduring a lot of that really worth the few instances where you feel a fleeting sense of connection?Putting effort into that social interaction also means I will have less energy to put into other pursuits that mean more to me: my marriage, playing piano, reading, career goals, riding my bike, existing friendships, etc.I don’t disagree with the article necessarily, but I do think it’s mostly an “ode to random social encounters” more than a serious attempt to make a case for why people not predisposed to doing so should try to have more random social encounters.The questions you ask in your last two sentences really get at the interesting stuff.

It&#x27;s been worth it.Today, a woman and I were both looking at the same display in Hobby Lobby, both clearly looking for something.When she moved over, I used something I&#x27;ve learned recently, which is, \"Oh, sorry to be in your way -- I&#x27;m just looking for something to build a backpack with.\" Which is not entirely true, since it&#x27;s a nopack -- a system which uses everyday components from my backpacking experience to make a carrying system, but close enough. A strange lie that is expected in simplification.I&#x27;ve learned that this mode of phrasing means \"Hi, I&#x27;m interested in maybe the same thing as you are, and would like to make potential conversation about [topic mentioned] or [thing we are mutually looking at] (or, as I later realized just now, [topic behind why you&#x27;re looking at the thing you&#x27;re looking at]).She took me up on all three of those things, and we talked about jean zippers, backpacking, safety on the Appalachian Trail (I&#x27;m a trans nonbinary woman&#x2F;gal, I don&#x27;t think she noticed though from how the conversation went. Places like Hobby Lobby and Chick Fil A can have a different vibe to them when not passing well), and a few other miscellaneous things. It was very nice, we talked maybe 5-10 minutes or so before going on our separate ways.My day felt more full, I felt more happy, and less isolated.I wish there was a dictionary, or some kind of book&#x2F;guide that explained these kinds of things. Somebody on the Appalachian Trail this year taught me how to indirectly ask for things (i.e. \"Do you know a good way to get to [X town]?\" while wearing a backpack sorta means \"Hey, can you give me a ride please?\". This was a shocking revelation to me, and made life much easier).Having a clear, simple guide would have saved me much grief. These things aren&#x27;t complicated, they&#x27;re just too complex and too hidden for most of us to sort out through all of the information overwhelm mire.I&#x27;m happy to talk more about this topic, I could really talk about it for a long timeOr just be short in your answers and don’t ask anything back.

I&#x27;m a constant beginner at it. I&#x27;m constant scared. Yea, whatever, I don&#x27;t care, let&#x27;s do some talking!How to talk to someone? There are a few ways:1. Give a compliment that you genuinely mean. It has to be genuine because sometimes you gotta go in-depth with your compliment to show that it&#x27;s genuine. Such as: \"I really like your whole outfit style. I don&#x27;t want to assume, but it makes me think you&#x27;re a free spirit playing guitar and I&#x27;m just vibing to that feel.\"2. Ask a question you&#x27;re curious about that you think the person next to you might on the off chance know something about.3. Talk about something happening in the situation that seems to be interesting \"do you have any clue why there&#x27;s such a huge line over there?\"4. Talk about something happening and just make it a statement \"I love the fact that Amsterdam has these free water fountains in certain places!\" (while everyone is standing near it)5. Tell a story.When you talk to someone, you need to be aware that they&#x27;re on autopilot. This means that you first need to grab their attention. I personally do this by saying \"excuse me\". When they look up, then I tell my actual thing I want to say.Responses:- Good: carry on- Mediocre: maybe carry on?- Not interested: don&#x27;t carry on. Don&#x27;t internalize it was you. It might&#x27;ve been you, it might&#x27;ve been something else. You don&#x27;t know. And even if it was you, maybe it really was some projection of their psychological state that goes back to childhood (aka not really you). You just don&#x27;t know. But yea, learning to be okay with that not everyone is interested is okay.Other ideas:* Playfulness helps. Playfulness generates humor. I don&#x27;t know how to generate humor, but I do know how to be playful (playful = don&#x27;t take things seriously, don&#x27;t look for truth, do look for fun and play).* Curiosity helps.* Asking questions helps, as long as you&#x27;re interested in them and you&#x27;re not asking them to just carry the conversation.* Statements help. Not everything needs to be Q&A.* Telling stories help. Just in general, it gives people to latch onto a lot.I hope this helps some. It&#x27;s a non-comprehensive guide made by someone who has spend a lot of time thinking about it (but at the moment is quite rusty :P). I fail at it often, I succeed at it often as well. Whatever, I&#x27;m talking to people. Failure and success doesn&#x27;t matter.

Republish this article Email Twitter Facebook 104 LinkedIn Print Each day, you leave digital traces of what you did, where you went, who you communicated with, what you bought, what you’re thinking of buying, and much more. This mass of data serves as a library of clues for personalized ads, which are sent to you by a sophisticated network – an automated marketplace of advertisers, publishers and ad brokers that operates at lightning speed. The ad networks are designed to shield your identity, but companies and governments are able to combine that information with other data, particularly phone location, to identify you and track your movements and online activity. More invasive yet is spyware – malicious software that a government agent, private investigator or criminal installs on someone’s phone or computer without their knowledge or consent. Spyware lets the user see the contents of the target’s device, including calls, texts, email and voicemail. Some forms of spyware can take control of a phone, including turning on its microphone and camera. Now, according to an investigative report by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, an Israeli technology company called Insanet has developed the means of delivering spyware via online ad networks, turning some targeted ads into Trojan horses. According to the report, there’s no defense against the spyware, and the Israeli government has given Insanet approval to sell the technology. Sneaking in unseen Insanet’s spyware, Sherlock, is not the first spyware that can be installed on a phone without the need to trick the phone’s owner into clicking on a malicious link or downloading a malicious file. NSO’s iPhone-hacking Pegasus, for instance, is one of the most controversial spyware tools to emerge in the past five years. Pegasus relies on vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS, the iPhone operating system, to infiltrate a phone undetected. Apple issued a security update for the latest vulnerability on Sept. 7, 2023. When you see an ad on a web page, behind the scenes an ad network has just automatically conducted an auction to decide which advertiser won the right to present their ad to you. Eric Zeng, CC BY-ND What sets Insanet’s Sherlock apart from Pegasus is its exploitation of ad networks rather than vulnerabilities in phones. A Sherlock user creates an ad campaign that narrowly focuses on the target’s demographic and location, and places a spyware-laden ad with an ad exchange. Once the ad is served to a web page that the target views, the spyware is secretly installed on the target’s phone or computer. Although it’s too early to determine the full extent of Sherlock’s capabilities and limitations, the Haaretz report found that it can infect Windows-based computers and Android phones as well as iPhones. Spyware vs. malware Ad networks have been used to deliver malicious software for years, a practice dubbed malvertising. In most cases, the malware is aimed at computers rather than phones, is indiscriminate, and is designed to lock a user’s data as part of a ransomware attack or steal passwords to access online accounts or organizational networks. The ad networks constantly scan for malvertising and rapidly block it when detected. Spyware, on the other hand, tends to be aimed at phones, is targeted at specific people or narrow categories of people, and is designed to clandestinely obtain sensitive information and monitor someone’s activities. Once spyware infiltrates your system, it can record keystrokes, take screenshots and use various tracking mechanisms before transmitting your stolen data to the spyware’s creator. While its actual capabilities are still under investigation, the new Sherlock spyware is at least capable of infiltration, monitoring, data capture and data transmission, according to the Haaretz report. The new Sherlock spyware is likely to have the same frightening capabilities as the previously discovered Pegasus. Who’s using spyware From 2011 to 2023, at least 74 governments engaged in contracts with commercial companies to acquire spyware or digital forensics technology. National governments might deploy spyware for surveillance and gathering intelligence as well as combating crime and terrorism. Law enforcement agencies might similarly use spyware as part of investigative efforts, especially in cases involving cybercrime, organized crime or national security threats. Companies might use spyware to monitor employees’ computer activities, ostensibly to protect intellectual property, prevent data breaches or ensure compliance with company policies. Private investigators might use spyware to gather information and evidence for clients on legal or personal matters. Hackers and organized crime figures might use spyware to steal information to use in fraud or extortion schemes. On top of the revelation that Israeli cybersecurity firms have developed a defense-proof technology that appropriates online advertising for civilian surveillance, a key concern is that Insanet’s advanced spyware was legally authorized by the Israeli government for sale to a broader audience. This potentially puts virtually everyone at risk. The silver lining is that Sherlock appears to be expensive to use. According to an internal company document cited in the Haaretz report, a single Sherlock infection costs a client of a company using the technology a hefty US$6.4 million.

I kept waiting for an explanation of how the spyware is installed, and just got this paragraph:> What sets Insanet’s Sherlock apart from Pegasus is its exploitation of ad networks rather than vulnerabilities in phones. A Sherlock user creates an ad campaign that narrowly focuses on the target’s demographic and location, and places a spyware-laden ad with an ad exchange. Once the ad is served to a web page that the target views, the spyware is secretly installed on the target’s phone or computer.That last sentence is simply impossible without an unpatched vulnerability on the device. If something is actually installed on the device, the vulnerability allowing this will eventually be patched. reply bhouston 19 hours agoparentI think that this is just a adtech-delivered spyware and likely exploits various zero-day browser issues. Those exploits will be ever changing as some are blocked and others are found. Pegasus has been doing this via SMS messages for more than a decade and they continue to be in operation quite successful even after each exploit made public is patched. reply hobobaggins 19 hours agoparentprev> Pegasus relies on vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS, the iPhone operating system, to infiltrate a phone undetected.

Many of these vulnerabilities had to do with different image&#x2F;video (or other file type) handling libraries. It&#x27;s one reason why you see so many in the industry pushing to use Rust.Plus, many of the highest value targets are likely iPhone users, so bad guys target where there is the biggest payoff. reply mmis1000 17 hours agorootparent> to use Rust.Also probably wasm for a finer-graded sandbox if rewrite is currently impracticable.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacks.mozilla.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;12&#x2F;webassembly-and-back-again...If the module memory corrupt for whatever reason. At least you would be able to unload it as a whole without pollution. reply chromoblob 16 hours agorootparentprevAll cases of undefined behavior in C&#x2F;C++ language can be replaced either with explicit aborts of the program or explicit infinite loops. The result is a subset of C&#x2F;C++; then anyone can write any C&#x2F;C++ code, use it as the restricted variant and most exploits resulting from UB (those that cannot cope with the aborting or hangup) will be eliminated automatically. To implement or not such a safe mode is the sole decision of the compiler author. Blame the compiler for rigidity, not language for flexibility. Developing new languages from scratch and tools, libraries for them costs much time and effort and fractures the market of programmers and costs them time to learn it as well. reply Novosell 16 hours agorootparentAnd yet so many of these corporate giants seem to be embracing Rust. Think they&#x27;ve all got it wrong? They just didn&#x27;t try hard enough with C and C++? reply chromoblob 4 hours agorootparentMy point is, the new language way may well be the \"harder\" one, for implementers or for users. It might be explained as a knee-jerk type reaction. Although new languages can still have some additional benefits of safety. Ways have tradeoffs and agents should evaluate them reasonably. I want to see a well-founded analysis of costs&#x2F;benefits for the choice between Rust and safe variant of C&#x2F;C++ or similar choice. replymortenjorck 17 hours agoparentprevThe best I can come up with is that this is some kind of novel abuse of Web Workers or other PWA technologies that, while never escaping the sandbox, effectively implements a spyware payload within constraints that were previously thought sufficient to prevent such attacks. reply dexwiz 20 hours agoparentprevAny significantly complex attack leverages multiple vulnerabilities. reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agorootparentNo shit, but the article is making the unreasonable claims that:1. This hack is not a result of a device vulnerability.2. That whatever technique is being used to install spyware cannot be defended against (i.e. with an OS patch).That is simply impossible if an actual executable is installed on the device. reply superjan 19 hours agorootparentThe article is really vague. Extraordinary claims should come with extraordinary evidence. That said, could it be that the ad has its own JavaScript that does its spying for the time it is visible on the page? Can adds do that? reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agorootparentEven then, that would be a vulnerability in the browser. JavaScript in ads is loaded in its own context and doesn&#x27;t have permission to access things outside of that context. reply beebeepka 17 hours agorootparentThat would depend on how the ad is being served, no? reply flangola7 17 hours agorootparentprev> That is simply impossible if an actual executable is installed on the device.There&#x27;s one exception, if there&#x27;s a vulnerability in the hard-coded ROM or the silicon itself. One was found not long ago and enabled newer iPhones to be jailbroken. It lacks persistence and requires lightning port access, but it can&#x27;t be patched.A no-click remote ACE at the unpatchable physical level would be the mother of all zero days, and too valuable to use for all but the highest of targets. reply solardev 19 hours agorootparentprevYes, but the article is confusing targeted advertising (not really a vulnerability) with actual zero day vulnerabilities. They are not really related, but both can be part of a targeted campaign I guess. reply EMM_386 21 hours agoprevThere is a lot of talk here but no real answers. What exploit is this using to infect Windows computers and Android phones?Does this have to do with the 0-day exploit in WebP that is causing a huge mess for the entire ecosystem?Everyone seems to be fixated on \"ads shouldn&#x27;t be able to run JavaScript\" and the like.What exactly is that JavaScript in the ad taking advantage of? Why would it matter that it&#x27;s an ad and not just a website?If ads can do it, web pages can do it. reply chucksmash 19 hours agoparentYou select the web pages, but the ads select you. reply EMM_386 18 hours agorootparentTrue, but either way the exploit needs to be addressed.While I agree the attack vector is pretty awful, I was just curious exactly what the exploit was. The article doesn&#x27;t even mention it.It links to Apple, which is likely that 0-day 0-click that Pegasus uses (BLASTPASS). They report that as a flaw in PassKit though, which would not affect Android or Windows.That&#x27;s why I was thinking the WebP overflow?That is actually worse, and makes the discussion here even more off-topic, because that has nothing to do with JavaScript. I has to do with decoding WebP images.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tarlogic.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cve-2023-4863&#x2F; reply pixl97 22 hours agoprevThis is nothing new.

Last time I saw some they were at least intersting (nothing to buy tomorrow, but good to know).But with the risks involved (malicious ads and being tracked), everything is blocked. It is \"risk blocking\" not \"ad blocking\". Not seing ads is just a side-effect.A newspaper will refuse to print unacceptable ads. Some ad-tech will deliver anything. Some websites use ads from ad-tech that delivers anything.Maybe there is a niche market opportunity for a guaranteed-safe-notracking ad-tech company to reach the target demographic of people blocking ads to reduce risk and avoid tracking. It would require cooperation with ad-blockers to provide a switch to drop to risk-blocking though. reply 4sellff 19 hours agoprevBlocking ads in your browser is responsible behavior. It is the same as putting a lock on the door to your house. There are people in the world who will think nothing of taking advantage of you if it means they can put money in their pocket. That said, the OP is referencing malicious ads, which are not designed to sell a product or service. Instead, they are designed to infect your device. From which they can collect&#x2F;extract data about you.The current ad-tech model needs to change and is due for disruption. Advertising is everywhere and it’s out of control. There seem to be more ads than ever, in every medium and in every square inch of surface area. In most cases, the ads are unwanted and not even relevant.Our attention is being stolen and massive amounts of money are being wasted by companies with a legitimate interest to make sales. The bottom-line is that consumers are being victimized by the constant bombardment of advertising. And the companies that sell products&#x2F;services, who need to build awareness and grow sales, are being taken advantage of by the ad-tech giants.A new model is needed and we are actively working on a solution called Sellff Offers. This solution allows sellers and buyers to connect directly, without the middleman. Sellff Offers inverts the current ad-tech model in three significant ways: [1] Opt-in, [2] Privacy friendly, and [3] Pays cash rewards.Here is an example Offer [ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sellff.com&#x2F;$&#x2F;ron.michel&#x2F;offer&#x2F;ewVkr ]. You choose whether to view the Offer. Your data and activity is not collected&#x2F;shared&#x2F;sold if you view the Offer. And, you are compensated for your time if you decide to participate in the Offer.Complaining about the current broken ad-tech model does not help to fix it. You need to take action to bring about the change you want to see. If you have an interest in building a new digital marketing&#x2F;promotions solution, we would like to speak with you. Regardless, we are very excited to see the growing consumer awareness of the dangers of ad-tech and the interest in alternatives ways to connect buyers and sellers. reply autoexec 17 hours agoparent> malicious ads, which are not designed to sell a product or service. Instead, they are designed to infect your device. From which they can collect&#x2F;extract data about you.At this point we can only assume that every ad is malicious. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they are designed to sell a product or service. They&#x27;ll still collect&#x2F;extract data about you at every opportunity.At best, they&#x27;re attempts to manipulate us. That might mean making us feel insecure about ourselves or our lifestyle so that they can trick is into giving them money. It might mean outright lying to us and feeding our fears to push us to support a certain politician or law. It might be promoting outright scams.Surveillance advertising needs to die. Paying people to view ads alone won&#x27;t remove the harms advertising can cause, but at least it&#x27;s a \"pull\" vs \"push\" model which I approve of since it can be safely ignored by anyone unwilling to subject themselves to manipulation and exploitation.You should consider a strict code of conduct for what types of ads you will&#x2F;won&#x27;t allow on your platform to keep the worst of it away. Fact-checking and vetting takes time and money, but it would keep your service from being used to spread disinformation and scams and could help prevent some of the harms. reply quitit 23 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s a bit odd to see old is new again.Goog&#x27;s Ad network had a pretty shoddy history with ads that redirect users automatically, but I had the feeling they got on top of this. It seems like something that could be stopped automatically. reply Scoundreller 22 hours agoparentProblem is there are other ad networks. Especially on content that Google won’t run ads on or that webmasters can add in addition to Google ads. reply eduction 21 hours agoprevAd based exploits are not remotely new. Most ads these days have their own javascript- it would be surprising if they couldnt be used to deliver exploits.As other have said, this is a key reason to block ads. reply autoexec 17 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s also a good reason to block javascript. Most browser exploits (even fingerprinting) depend on JS being enabled. Disable it by default, and you&#x27;re much much safer. reply xtracto 28 minutes agorootparentAnd also a good reason to block http&#x2F;https, most exploits in the wild are distributed via this protocol. The percentage of malware in this protocol compared to others like ftp, nntp or gopher is outstanding. Disabling it will make you even much safer. reply bhouston 19 hours agoparentprevThe idea isn&#x27;t new, but the fact that a company is commercializing spyware deliver via ad-networks is new. reply cf141q5325 20 hours agoprevBit off topic, but i think this is a good place to remind people that they should remember to enforce separation of two factor platforms.

Not everyone is well educated enough on the nefarious nature of targeted online advertising and the technical processes of blocking them on each platform.In some EU countries we have pretty strict regulations on what ads are allowed, where they&#x27;re allowed and for what they&#x27;re allowed, precisely because not everyone can \"mentally ignore\" them and people can be easily influenced.So you can&#x27;t just say \"well, it&#x27;s you&#x27;re own fault you got addicted to opioids&#x2F;gambling&#x2F;drinking&#x2F;smoking, so you get what you deserve\", when the whole city is plastered with ads for such accessible addictions. \"Got a tooth-ache? Ask your doctor about OxyContin.\" \"Got trouble paying the bills? Get a loan with 500% interest rate from us on the spot.\" \"Wanna look cool? Smoke Bullshit cigars.\"Usually, the less educated and less well-off people are, the more vulnerable to nefarious and predatory advertising they tend to be, so it&#x27;s the responsibility of us as a society to take legal steps of ensuring the regulation and blocking of targeted web ads at communal&#x2F;societal level instead of leaving it to the individuals and the mercy of the \"free market\". reply thefurdrake 22 hours agorootparent> I was with you until this piece.

There&#x27;s not an implied contract that says you have to look at the ad to see the website. The website is free. They ask you to watch some ads voluntarily. It&#x27;s not wrong to refuse. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 19 hours agoparentprevUsers should not need to \"block\" ads. Imagine if the telephone worked like a \"modern\" web browser. Dial a number and the phone automatically calls 12 other numbers, chosen by the person at the number dialed, and the 12 other numbers are unknown to the person dialling.Everyone agrees the early internet and web was different. The auto-load resources \"feature\" was intended, or even Javascript, for a web that was experimental and fun to use.These features are now used almost invariably for commercial purposes. Most of that is surveillance.Without auto-load resources and Javascript, the user dials one number and only connects to one number. Most advertising and tracking stops working. When visiting sites submitted to HN, I&#x27;m not using a browser that auto-load resources or runs Javascript, hence there is no need for me to \"block\" ads; I control what request.People have been expending vast amounts of energy trying to counter \"automatic\" behaviour of the browser they choose to use. Perhaps the challenge is a new type of \"fun\". Otherwise, why use a browser that one cannot control. Find an open source browser. Remove the offensive \"features\". Re-compile. Done.This is exactly what I did with the browser I&#x27;m using to type this comment.Not everything that is \"popular\" is good. Perhaps that&#x27;s an effect of advertising. Several so-called \"tech\" companies want the public, including government officials, to believe that advertising dollars are necessary to sustain a useful computer network.^1 Feel free to debate.Everything that is good does not need advertising. UBlockOrigin is one example. By generally all accounts, it&#x27;s great and, AFAIK, it is not supported by advertising.1. The truth however is that advertising dollars are only necessary to sustain those companies. reply thn-gap 21 hours agoparentprev> You get what you deserve if you don&#x27;t block ads.I hope you do great contributions to the cause if you are already at the point of victim blaming. reply cf141q5325 20 hours agorootparentThere is a stupidity component here that i think got lost in the framing.

An individual writing an investigative piece over months incurs a lot of expenses, the 10 minute YouTube video you watched probably took many hours or days to produce, the storage and bandwidth cost of the 4K video you watched is not nil.An ideal world would have properly regulated ads on platforms like YouTube and Adwords held to the same standards as some European ad agencies. But since we don&#x27;t live in an ideal world, pay for a subscription to a newspaper you read a lot. Give someone you enjoy like $5 on Patreon, maybe more if they&#x27;re not the type to double dip with sponsorship spots AND have a Patreon (personal pet peeve) and immediately unsubscribe, that&#x27;s worth several thousand ad-supported views depending on their CPM.

For those not big enough to support this, there are agencies that will do the entire thing for you.This idea that we need to allow untrusted third parties to run code on our computer because poor website operators would just have no other way to make money is bogus. This is particularly true for journalists who should be extremely uncomfortable that google has full access to their articles and can manipulate them before they&#x27;re shown to end users.In an ideal world, people would take and make 100% of the advertising money for themselves, and pennies-on-the-dollar advertising aggregators would have no reason to exist. reply tootie 18 hours agorootparentWe may get back there but the 2005-2020 era just ruined everything for a while. The game of monetizing eyeballs became too lucrative for too many low quality content farms. That has to unwind and consumers have to recognize value again. For now, whoever runs the most aggressive ads for the most people will get the most resources.For reference, I work at a smallish media company doing high quality news and content. We have a small and strapped sales team. They sell what they can but the buyers have the same conundrum. They aren&#x27;t all looking for partners when they can just buy traffic at predictable prices and put their faith in brand safety tools. They want to maximize their efficiency of their ad spend and that usually doesn&#x27;t involve looking for partners and relationships when they can just click a button and get more views. The result is that we&#x27;ve been hit by malicious ads more than once. reply thefurdrake 20 hours agorootparentprevLook.I remember what the internet was like before the adtech hegemony was so entrenched.I was happier with my internet experience back then.I legit do not care if every service on the internet that relies on ads ceased.

I&#x27;m fine with paying 5 dollars a month for a reliable search engine, too. I&#x27;ve been collecting the patreons of every youtube channel I follow and pretty quick here I&#x27;m going to be setting aside part of my monthly budget to it. Supporting healthy monetization schemes is part of my beliefs.Hell, I&#x27;d be 100% happy to participate in a good-faith attempt to charge me a small fee PER ARTICLE I READ (similar to how I was happy to pay for music when it became possible to buy individual tracks and not entire albums), but the industry collectively failed to grab its sac and make that change already, so I don&#x27;t care about them or how Kantian philosophy applied to what I believe would ruin their way of life.

EFE/EPA/FILE/JAGADEESH NV India fails to re-establish communication with its Moon probe 22 September 2023 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Share New Delhi, Sep 22 (EFE).- The Indian space agency reported on Friday that it tried, without success so far, to re-establish communication with the probe it sent a month ago to the south pole of the Moon, ending the hope that the vehicle could withstand the low temperatures of the lunar night. “Efforts have been made to establish communication with the Vikram lander and Pragyan rover to ascertain their wake-up condition. As of now, no signals have been received from them. Efforts to establish contact will continue,” the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. Last month, ISRO became the first country to successfully make a soft landing on the south pole of the Moon with its Chandrayaan-3 mission, which successfully achieved its objectives during the initial 14 Earth days, equivalent to half a lunar day, on the Moon’s surface. The mission’s Vikram lander and Pragyan explorer were put to sleep on Sep. 4 as night dawned on the region it operated on the Moon. However, there was uncertainty about the possibility of these to resume functioning after facing extremely low temperatures of the lunar night which can go as low as -200 degrees Celsius. Moreover, its battery needed to remain at a certain level to be able to recharge again with the solar dawn. India is the fourth country to be able to successfully land on the Moon, after the United States, the former Soviet Union and China. The Indian mission coincided with Russia’s attempt to reach the lunar south pole. It was expected to reach shortly before Chandrayaan-3 despite having taken off much later. However it crashed due to technical problems.

This is measly 20° difference. reply stouset 21 hours agorootparentI made the mistake of going splitboarding in the backcountry a few years back in -20°C with -40°C windchill.Going up the mountain was surprisingly fine. I even had taken off both my jackets and was just wearing thermals as the heat I was generating working to go uphill was enough to keep me comfortable.Unfortunately when we reached the top, we also ended up directly in the wind with no available cover. Within the ten minutes it took to put my jackets back on and transition to go downhill, I was nearly hypothermic. I couldn’t even operate my fingers enough to bring the idiot-proof magnetic clasp on my helmet together. The whole group was on the verge of panic to get off the top of that ridge.

Walking is not too bad (in the squeaky snow) because usually there&#x27;s NO wind. Cars usually had (plug-in engine-coolant) &#x27;tank heaters&#x27; and battery trickle-chargers to keep engines startable.But there were plenty of snowmobile riders in the area. Some of them who bundled up and attempted to ride at these temperatures learned that their lungs did not work well after a short time. reply takinola 11 hours agorootparentprevI once encountered -30°F one winter in Fairbanks. I visited a hot spring where, for some cruel and unusual reason, the facility was designed so you needed to walk about 10 meters out of the (well heated) building to get to the water. And of course, you would do this walk in nothing but just your bathing suit. That was the longest 10m walk of my life.The cherry on the cake of the experience was that you get into water that is 70+°F but every part of your body above the water line is exposed to -30°F winds.

Of course it&#x27;s not -200°C, but one thing to remember is that there is no temperature in the vacuum. The temperature of the Lunar surface is not it.

I have one too, but it completely throws away compatibility and is very simplistic. I opted for a lisp-like language instead of a lua-like language (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sid-code&#x2F;nmoo but don&#x27;t look at the code, it&#x27;s embarrassing).I have some questions: - Does each verb call create a whole new world state that it mutates, and later commits to the database? That&#x27;s the impression I get from reading the code. Does this come with a lot of overhead? - What is that emacs mode you&#x27;re using to edit verb code? reply cmrdporcupine 19 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve done the \"whole new thing\" before, too. 20ish years ago, tho I only have a few fragments of what I worked on back then: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rdaum&#x2F;mica being one of them I found on an old drive. Not complete.But sticking with compatibility has allowed me to enforce development discipline, basically. And then I&#x27;ll move it onwards from there. I have many ideas. And a product concept (if I could find an investor...). But I felt it important to start with a thing with existing foundation and use cases before doing the exciting stuff&#x2F;changes.Re: world state &#x2F; transactions -- yeah, basically all I&#x2F;O and mutations happen in a transactional context, and then at commit time conflicts are resolved; if they&#x27;re not resolve-able, the transaction is retried in a new state. As for overhead, yes potentially maybe a lot, but it&#x27;s also a solvable problem; this is how an MVCC SQL database (like, even Postgres) works. TLDR it&#x27;s likely inefficient now, but I believe I can make it efficient. And I think it&#x27;s the best way to solve the shared world state problem and still meet user&#x27;s expectations of consistency. Original LambdaMOO had a global interpreter lock and only one user was mutating the world at a time, in their given tick slice. Not gonna scale.Re: the MOO client, it&#x27;s `rmoo.el`: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lisdude&#x2F;rmoo -- it&#x27;s been around for a long time (25, 30 years?) and it and&#x2F;or MOO.el (another emacs one) are how&#x2F;why I learned emacs in the first place. I had to minor patch my local copy to make it work with emacs 29.1, though I don&#x27;t know elisp well enough to say whether my patch is the right thing to do or not, so...EDIT: I just re-read and saw you asked whether each new verb call creates a new state, and actually it&#x27;s not that. It&#x27;s each new command or network transaction, which can in fact lead to a chain of verb (method) calls. Recall a MUD has a command loop, so basically a transaction begins at command entry, and commits when all the invoked methods&#x2F;verbs provoked from that complete. reply derefr 18 hours agorootparent> Original LambdaMOO had a global interpreter lock and only one user was mutating the world at a time, in their given tick slice. Not gonna scale.I’ve previously seen (abandoned) attempts to convert the Erlang runtime directly into a MOO runtime. Each command being a concurrent actor-process would make a lot of sense to me. (Though a semantics where all commands are MVCC against the at-inception world-state and will rollback or retry on conflict, kind of moots having any kind the advantage of a runtime based on message-passing, since you’re not going to be passing messages between separate concurrent “sessions.”) reply bcrosby95 18 hours agorootparent> Each command being a concurrent actor-process would make a lot of sense to me.I&#x27;ve tossed around doing MUDs in Elixir before. I&#x27;m not familiar with MOO though.State has to be owned by a process - who owns the state of the world? Process per \"thing\" is too fine grained - you&#x27;re going to have race conditions and deadlocks. Process per \"room\" can work, but it&#x27;s still not easy. There are still some cross-room coordinating actions you need to tighten up, and this makes general scripting very hard.Keep in mind, when data is passed \"between\" processes it is deep copied. This can be a big problem depending upon your process model and how many things your players can carry around.As an experiment I made my own software transactional memory. It worked, assuming no network partitions, but designing and testing it to work in an environment with those was beyond me. reply derefr 15 hours agorootparent> State has to be owned by a process - who owns the state of the world? ... Keep in mind, when data is passed \"between\" processes it is deep copied.The Erlang runtime has other stateful things besides processes, and manipulating data within these and&#x2F;or getting a handle on data in these places doesn&#x27;t necessarily involve copying.• ETS tables, which hold state privately to themselves (with copying in&#x2F;out) in a similar way to how processes do. If you manipulate data inside ETS tables by \"sending compute to data\" (think Redis INCR) rather than by \"sending data to compute\", then no copying happens.• \"Globals\" in the form of data compiled into read-only versioned modules loaded into the modules table and available to be referenced from any&#x2F;all active processes, only copied if the module gets unloaded before the process dies. (Originally this was just a design pattern — https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;discord&#x2F;fastglobal — but it eventually became its own runtime feature in Erlang 22, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erlang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;man&#x2F;persistent_term).• Large binaries (anything over 64 bytes) aren&#x27;t allocated in an actor&#x27;s memory arena, but instead are allocated in a special global-per-node binaries heap, and then ref-counted, where each actor-process holds one reference to each large-binary it&#x27;s using, and then each read-only slice of that binary, in turn holds a reference to the per-actor reference handle for the binary. One clever technique for sharing a large \"database\" of data between many actors, is to store the data encoded in a large binary in an encoding that is efficient to partwise-decode; and have the \"lookup\" operation just parse+decode the appropriate data out of the binary. (This is how erlang:module_info&#x2F;2 used to work — the global modules-table itself holding a set of references to the loaded modules&#x27; binaries, which module_info would then parse metadata out of on demand.) reply intelVISA 17 hours agorootparentprev> As an experiment I made my own software transactional memory. It worked, assuming no network partitions, but designing and testing it to work in an environment with those was beyond me.BFT STM is a noble goal and, tbh, building performant fault tolerant atomic transaction systems outside of C++ must be quite challenging with all the abstractions atop it reply cmrdporcupine 18 hours agorootparentprevYeah the whole actor thing is kind of orthogonal to the question of how you handle the shared world state (which is what makes a MOO a MOO.) There are parts of my runtime that look Erlang-ish, Actor-ish, because that&#x27;s a concurrency pattern that Rust does well with, in general.In the end a MOO is just a database with fancy stored procedures. And the original code is not a particular... good one. Handling serialization conflicts is what databases have to do as one of their core abilities, and LambdaMOO just tries to punt on the whole question. reply smirya0 17 hours agorootparenthow did you come to pick Rust (just curious, vs Elixir, Java with Loom, etc)? reply cmrdporcupine 15 hours agorootparentThese days Rust is both my day job language (I work on systems for autonomy in tractors) and my hobby language. It&#x27;s my preferred tool.I have attempted similar systems in C++ before, and got fairly far along at times. But Rust really solves a lot of problems, I tear my hear out a lot less.This is a \"systems\" type of application; this is a database and compiler and a virtual machine and language runtime. I&#x27;m not super concerned with optimization at this point, but I will likely have to be at some point. Being closer to the metal is key for me on a project like this.I&#x27;m likely to e.g. rip out RocksDB and replace it with my own database engine at some point (something I work on here and there as another side project, unpublished still.) I will also likely need a better garbage collection solution. With Rust I have options.The community of libraries available for Rust is good. The right tools are there. And the language is expressive enough to make it work well.That said, I have mulled writing the \"host\" portion -- the layer that manages network sockets and web endpoints, in Elixir&#x2F;Erlang:The &#x27;daemon&#x27; portion of the system sits behind an RPC layer built around ZeroMQ -- so that layer can be restarted&#x2F;upgraded without losing active network connections. Or can sit on a separate machine for scalability reasons, etc. So it&#x27;s entirely possible to split what I&#x27;m calling the \"host\" (network facing layer, what we used to call a \"frontend\" when I worked at Google, but most people think of that term as referring to a UI layer) from the backend \"daemon.\"Anyways for me this project ties together a bunch of interests in systems programming I&#x27;ve had for years. It becomes a kind of synthesis project. reply crooked-v 13 hours agorootparentprevTalking about SQL, now I find myself wondering how practical it would be to try and build an entire MU* engine inside a database, with db functions for input and something like an events table with Postgres real-time replication for output. reply cmrdporcupine 2 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;d find that the SQL parser layer is \"getting in the way\", but on the whole that&#x27;s effectively what something like LambdaMOO can be properly distilled to. It has in theory all the layers of a database. But because it was all written as hobby&#x2F;student code it doesn&#x27;t really do any of it all that systematically.But yes one approach could be to take something like Postgres and write an alternative stored procedure implementation, and give it access directly to the query execution later bypassing the SQL parser maybe. reply branon 13 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s a great book about the original instance of this software, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;My-Tiny-Life-Passion-Virtual&#x2F;dp&#x2F;08050... fun old internet flamewars and a lot of discussion about the gender spectrum and how it&#x27;s expressed by individuals online. reply cmrdporcupine 12 hours agoparent\"I was there, Gandalf, 3000 years ago\"From \"A Rape In Cyberspace: \"no hate, no anger, no interest at all.

Of course, that telnet client was a Java applet, so I replaced it with a websocket console, and a websocket server that proxies telnet to LambdaMOO.One of the bigger challenges with the web UI is that HTTPS isn&#x27;t really optional anymore, and the enCore database has a ton of `http:&#x2F;&#x2F;` links. So it requires a reverse proxy in front that can rewrite those, luckily in Nginx it&#x27;s possible to use a small Javascript program to do it. reply fzzzy 11 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s a fork called stunt &#x2F; improvise that implements hashmaps. I&#x27;d love it if the list syntax was changed to use square brackets, and then if the hashmap syntax could be curly braces.I&#x27;ve also wanted to give each object an isolated environment (make each one an actor), but I haven&#x27;t thought too deeply about how exactly that would work and look. I&#x27;ve been planning in the back of my head to do this at some point in the next year, and was planning on implementing on top of the original codebase, but if there&#x27;s a rust version, I&#x27;ll use that.I know it wouldn&#x27;t be compatible with existing cores, but I&#x27;d be using it as the backend for a graphical ui anyway.How did you go about converting the code? Did you just read through it, or did you start with a c to rust tool? I always thought the programmers manual and codebase were quite concise and readable.One last thing, there were patches in the 90s to add journaling on top of the checkpoint system... Did those ever get merged into the main codebase?Thanks for doing this! I&#x27;m excited! reply fzzzy 10 hours agoparentI see after reading more that it has a modern concurrency and object database implementation. Really cool!Websockets and utf8 as well. Lovely. reply cmrdporcupine 2 hours agoparentprev\"How did you go about converting the code?\"Mixture of approaches. No automatic translation. After bringing over the AST and opcodes, etc most of it I wrote without reference to the original code, with the functionality in mind. Where MOO was doing something a bit funky, I often wrote code with a second window open to look at how they were doing it. But in general it came down to running a core over and over again and finding how it broke. MOO has some unexpected behaviours in spots that grew over time. If I were to start over with this, I&#x27;d invest the energy in ripping out parts of MOO and turning them into a library and then write tests that run them side by side through the same opcode sequence and compare output. But MOO was built quite monolithic, so that&#x27;s hard.Re: maps, MOO&#x27;s value types are immutable&#x2F;copy-on-write. So while I want a map type, a typical HashMap may not make a lot of sense, as it would be doing a deep copy on each addition. Some kind of functional persistent map would probably be appropriate. Syntactical sugar for maps would be nice, and I will probably add it later. But I&#x27;m also not as concerned with the MOO language itself, as I see it as only one language among potentially many to run on the system.\"I&#x27;ve also wanted to give each object an isolated environment (make each one an actor)\"Maybe related; I intend on reworking the object reference system such that object numbers and $sysobj-references are a form of published capabilities. That is, I will be introducing \"private\" objects with some sort of signing & publishing & capability style references, and slowly deprecating object numbers. But that&#x27;s all post 1.0 stuff. reply nrr 15 hours agoprevThis makes me smile a lot. Whenever I pick up a new programming language, one of the first projects I tackle is writing a port of a similar MU* server because of the same breadth of concerns, so it&#x27;s very nice seeing someone else recognize the complexity and take it on as a worthy challenge. (Though, this goes the extra mile and modernizes things; I&#x27;ve seldom accomplished that.)I hadn&#x27;t looked at doing this in Rust yet, so it&#x27;ll definitely be interesting to give the code a read, particularly with the focus toward modernization. reply smirya0 18 hours agoprevVery cool! Is it still using cooperative multitasking? My understanding was MOO verbs&#x2F;tasks run until the verb does suspend&#x2F;fork or an input() call happens or something like that, or until the verb runs out of \"ticks\" and is killed by the VM. How do you do it?Does it use async I&#x2F;O &#x2F; is it one thread still?You might find this conversation interesting about multi-threading in LambdaMOO: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;moo-talk&#x2F;c&#x2F;omF68ZM9rZc&#x2F;m&#x2F;B3f-jj4... reply cmrdporcupine 18 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s multithreaded with multiversion concurrency control over shared state. Each command invocation is a new thread, in a new transaction, and the database attempts to resolve any shared state conflicts at commit time.There&#x27;s still ticks and time limits, but they&#x27;re there to impose time &#x2F; resource limits, not used to control access to shared state.Tick-based time-slicing to the database is one reason why LambdaMOO (and its offshoots like toaststunt, etc.) has intrinsic scalability limits. (In the 90s, LambdaMOO-the-actual-MOO used to lag like a son of a bitch under load...)(This is not to say the actual impl of MVCC I have right now is ideal. It&#x27;s a work in progress. I just defer to RocksDB&#x27;s conflict resolution, and it is built on assumptions of \"single writer, multiple readers\" at its foundation, which isn&#x27;t ideal for what I&#x27;m doing... ) reply miki123211 16 hours agorootparentCan this transactional model be made to handle in-transaction I&#x2F;O?I&#x27;ve seen MOOs that had verbs for performing HTTP requests, through shelling out to curl IIRC. If you have a verb that reads a value, sends it out and updates it based on the response, what do you do if the value changes in the meantime? When is the transaction committed exactly? reply cmrdporcupine 15 hours agorootparentI won&#x27;t be providing outbound HTTP (or inbound) requests via MOO code. The only I&#x2F;O is what is provided through the Session interface which is, yes, transactional; all I&#x2F;O \"effects\" are buffered and committed or reverted after the same at the DB level. Inbound HTTP is provided at the Rust layer in front of a standardized RPC interface over 0MQ and goes through the same set of transactional semantics as all other commands:The transaction gets committed at the end of command execution, and then all the I&#x2F;O that \"occurred\" in the narrative log gets output to its destinations. If a serialization conflict occurred, the output buffers (and all other mutations) are discarded, and everything retried, again. (In theory. Right now it just rolls back and barfs, because I have not finished this layer yet :-) )Where this falls over is with MOO&#x27;s synchronous \"read\" builtin, which is used in places for e.g. password changes or prompts. This is something I have not tackled yet, but will probably just have to deprecate, and will be one of the only things breaking compatibility with existing cores.Alternatively I could or might provide a transaction mode which is \"softer\" for tasks that need that kind of dependent input.It will require some thought. But on the whole MOO&#x27;s model is similar to a database: In a DB it&#x27;s query in, commit, see results; in my system in it&#x27;s command parse, execute verb, commit, flush I&#x2F;O results out. reply smirya0 10 hours agorootparentread() would be a killer feature for adoption. There&#x27;s a ton of MOOs that make use of this in-verb, for menus or other things.For example:color = player:choose(\"Pick a color\", {\"Red\", \"Orange\", ...}); reply cmrdporcupine 2 hours agorootparentYeah it&#x27;s tricky, but TBH I&#x27;ve never been comfortable with this way of interacting with the user on a MOO. It breaks the standard method of interaction there, which is command-verb based. To have the player pick from a menu... don&#x27;t create a prompt... create a menu \"thing\" in the world and have a \"choose\" verb on it and ask them to interact with it.\"read\" def presents a problem for the transactional model. So like I said I have basically 3 choices: not implement it, or loosen the transactional constraints for verbs that require it. the latter would be something like: as a user I accept that this could blow up at commit and require me to enter the prompt again (\"I&#x27;m sorry, something went wrong and I&#x27;ll need you to enter that again.\"), or treat it like suspend() which actually creates a new transaction (commits and then creates a new one) replytrollied 19 hours agoprevHands up if you know what tinyfugue is :) reply blipvert 18 hours agoparentNow that is a name that I’ve not heard in a long time … reply tromp 18 hours agoparentprevI spent a good fraction of my years of MUD playing time on writing ever more elaborate tf macros to automate as much MUD play as possible. $ wc ~&#x2F;tfrc 878 6634 53336 &#x2F;Users&#x2F;tromp&#x2F;tfrc reply stavros 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s how I learned to program.

I was hunting around (with poor connectivity) and for the life of me could not find the link to the HTML version of gmail from my laptop. I supposedly had \"5G\" from my T-Mobile International Data Pass.Also sometimes phone calls and very frequently SMS messages would not go through in many parts of South Africa including Cape Town. I still received mail through my IMAP connections and we switched to Whatsapp for work communications, which appears to be stable for most any low bandwidth or intermittent connectivity situation. Through my 1 week in Africa I didn&#x27;t miss any messages at all on Whatsapp and was able to send messages any time I had signal. Whatsapp voice calls worked pretty well. Slack on my mobile seemed to work but I was not sure if it was synching in real time. Slack voice calls I was told were pretty bad from my side.We&#x27;ve seen a huge rise in Whatsapp use recently when working in our colleagues in less developed areas.I initially loathed dealing with \"yet another messaging app\" when people started using Whatsapp, but it&#x27;s great to see a tool that&#x27;s robust enough to work in non-optimal connectivity. reply timeon 1 hour agoparent> my laptopHow about local client? reply MichaelZuo 2 hours agoparentprevIsn’t email even more reliable then Whatsapp? reply navane 2 hours agorootparentNot when the web Gmail client requires 40mb of crust just to read or send 1kb messages reply asicsp 5 hours agoprevAlso being discussed at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37630243 (2 hours ago, 54 comments) and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37558372 (5 days back, 101 comments) reply drpixie 38 minutes agoprevWeb mail was great before mobile data became normal - when you used a work computer, and a home computer, and ...remember... internet cafes!But now mobile data is normal.

You could&#x27;ve been paying for this email account all this time w&#x2F;o realizing it. And even if they don&#x27;t provide it right now, maybe they can do so for extra fee.If not, different countries have all kinds of programs to give free emails. Usually quite limited in storage, but still. You could start checking that with the post office -- they&#x27;d be the likely candidates to provide such a service. reply grvdrm 2 hours agoparentprevI’m on year #2 with Hey.

You cannot do proper authentication with GMail anymore. You need an elaborate dance, which will depend on how old your GMail account is (they became bolder with time and started to require more personal data from users), you will need to procure a special permit for your IMAP program to connect to GMail, and the way to do that changed over time. Also, newer GMail accounts cannot be registered without MFA, so you&#x27;ll have to figure out how to deal with that.Having a very old GMail account, I still hold on to it, because I can still use IMAP in Gnus.

HTML button appears immediately at the bottom while the website is struggling to load and clicking it will load emails. Very helpful if you ask me. reply onion2k 3 hours agoparentprevThe difference between having a bare-bones HTML page, versus a bloated one, could make a significant price difference.A well designed Single Page App should be downloading a small-as-possible initial bundle with the page HTML and CSS, and then only downloading the data necessary for any given page. In theory that results in less bandwidth used if you&#x27;re looking at a reasonably large number of pages compared to downloading a server rendered HTML page for each page because you only download the HTML once in the SPA version compared to every page you load with the SSR version. This is literally the reason why SPAs became popular in the first place.In badly built apps this isn&#x27;t the case - the data is bloated, the bundle isn&#x27;t optimized, etc. I imagine in the case of Gmail this is the case though - you probably only need to read a couple of dozen moderately large emails before the JS version starts to win out. This is something you&#x27;d need to test rather than making an assumption though.That said, a native app will win over both because it&#x27;s already on your device so the bandwidth used is only the email data. reply sgt 3 hours agorootparentWith continuous deployment, that cached SPA may frequently be replaced though. Depending on the team, but I&#x27;ve seen people deploying to production several times a week.

BETH MOLE - 9/22/2023, 1:34 PM Adult female worm of Angiostrongylus cantonensis recovered from rat lungs with characteristic barber-pole appearance (anterior end of worm is to the top). Scale bar = 1 mm. Lindo et al. 129 WITH The dreaded rat lungworm—a parasite with a penchant for rats and slugs that occasionally finds itself rambling and writhing in human brains—has firmly established itself in the Southeast US and will likely continue its rapid invasion, a study published this week suggests. The study involved small-scale surveillance of dead rats in the Atlanta zoo. Between 2019 and 2022, researchers continually turned up evidence of the worm. In all, the study identified seven out of 33 collected rats (21 percent) with evidence of a rat lungworm infection. The infected animals were spread throughout the study's time frame, all in different months, with one in 2019, three in 2021, and three in 2022, indicating sustained transmission. Although small, the study \"suggests that the zoonotic parasite was introduced to and has become established in a new area of the southeastern United States,\" the study's authors, led by researchers at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, concluded. The study was published Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The finding is concerning given the calamitous infection the rat lungworm, aka Angiostrongylus cantonensis, can cause in humans. The parasitic nematodes are, as their name suggests, typically found in rats. But they have a complicated life cycle, which can be deadly when disrupted. Sickening cycle Normally, adult worms live in the arteries around a rat's lungs—hence rat lungworm. There, they mate and lay eggs. The worm's larvae then burst out of the lungs, get coughed up by the rat, and are swallowed and eventually pooped out. From there, the larvae are picked up by slugs or snails. This can happen if the gastropods eat the rat poop or if the ravenous larvae just bore into their soft bodies. The larvae then develop in the slugs and snails, which, ideally, are eventually eaten by rats. Back in a rat, the late-stage larvae penetrate the intestines, enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the rat's central nervous system and brain. There they mature into sub-adults then migrate to the lungs, where they become full adults and mate, thus completing the cycle. Advertisement Humans become accidental hosts in various ways. They may eat undercooked snails or inadvertently eat an infected slug or snail hiding in their unwashed salad. Infected snails and slugs can also be eaten by other animals first, like frogs, prawns, shrimp, or freshwater crabs. If humans then eat those animals before fully cooking them, they can become infected. Gross. University of Florida A “semi-slug,” carrier of the rat lungworm disease, sticks to a garbage bag last week in Hana. KAWIKA KAINA Angiostrongylus cantonensis third stage (L3), infective larva recovered from a slug. Image captured under differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. CDC A. costaricensis first stage (L1) larva in human intestinal tissue CDC A. cantonensis adult worm recovered from vitreous humor of a human patient. The bursa is one indication that this is a male worm. CDC Previous Slide Next Slide When a rat lungworm finds itself in a human, it does what it usually does in rats—it heads to the central nervous system and brain. Sometimes the migration of the worms to the central nervous system is asymptomatic or only causes mild transient symptoms. But, sometimes, they cause severe neurological dysfunction. This can start with nonspecific symptoms like headache, light sensitivity, and insomnia and develop into neck stiffness and pain, tingling or burning of the skin, double vision, bowel or bladder difficulties, and seizures.

However, in most cases, the parasite will die over time - humans are not its preferred host.\" reply __loam 18 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re also anxiety symptoms haha.The rule of thumb for me meningitis I&#x27;ve heard is that if you&#x27;re experiencing the worst headache of your like, get to a doctor. reply bikelang 19 hours agoparentprevIt’s just worms; not my dying youth. reply HeyLaughingBoy 20 hours agoparentprevThink of it as an excuse. reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agoprevThere was a famous and tragic case of an Australian teenager who ate a slug on a dare, suffered a horrible illness, and eventually died from rat lungworm.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5445715&#x2F;australia-slug-dare-sam-ballard&#x2F; reply drt5b7j 15 hours agoparentWhen I was a kid, I don&#x27;t remember that my parents ever thought me that I shouldn&#x27;t eat slugs. Somehow I figured it out on my own. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentResponses like this are so shitty, and you should feel bad for making it. A lot of people do risky or silly things when they&#x27;re teenagers - very few of them pay the price with their lives. I don&#x27;t eat slugs either, but \"dying a horribly painful death due to a worm in my brain\" wouldn&#x27;t be high up on the things I would have been concerned about (until I read about that story, that is).But congrats on showing the world what a superiorly smart guy you are. reply Ancapistani 13 hours agorootparentWhen I was six or so, I ate a leaf of poison ivy on a dare. Made $5!I should add that I was already quite sure that I wasn’t allergic to poison ivy, at least via skin contact. I didn’t notice any ill effects. reply drt5b7j 10 hours agorootparentprev> A lot of people do risky or silly things when they&#x27;re teenagers - very few of them pay the price with their lives.This is precisely the nature of risk.We don&#x27;t live in a deterministic world where everyone who eats slugs dies. If we did, that kid wouldn&#x27;t have eaten a slug.No, we live in a world with uncertainty. If you eat a slug, almost for sure nothing bad will happen. reply blub 5 hours agorootparentprevThe person in question was an adult around 19 years old. At this age one must surely know that eating bad foods would cause stomach problems, vomiting, etc.Guy must have been intoxicated or had other problems to do such an abnormal thing. There’s a lesson here, but it’s fair to point out that lesson isn’t “don’t eat slugs” as most people already understand this. reply tmpX7dMeXU 11 hours agorootparentprevDeep down you believe that this is due to you being better in so e way. The reality is that it’s dumb luck. You were a dumb kid like everyone else was. For all we know you spent all your time inside and were afraid of slugs. A kid died and snide comments about ‘personal responsibility’ add nothing. reply blub 5 hours agorootparentNot eating slugs is not “dumb luck” and not all kids are equally “dumb”. Yes, kids are particularly vulnerable to groupthink and peer pressure and can’t evaluate risks properly, but that doesn’t make them dumb.I grew up in a village, spent my childhood in gardens, on fields or playing in the dirt and *nobody* I ever knew would eat a slug or any other kind of creature for that matter. The thought never even crossed anyone’s mind, why the hell would you even do that? reply drt5b7j 5 hours agorootparentThank you for spelling my thoughts out so eloquently. Often times I start typing something out of hn and immediately get tired of explaining obvious stuff and end up doing a half assed job.. reply drt5b7j 10 hours agorootparentprev> For all we know you spent all your time insideWhat&#x27;s wrong with spending all your time inside? I don&#x27;t know any kid who spent all his time outside and turned out well.> The reality is that it’s dumb luck.If there&#x27;s any luck here, was that I had parents who told me things like \"don&#x27;t do things just to impress people\". Me not eating a slug was not luck.I find it so out of touch that you can&#x27;t concieve that not all kids are the same. Not all kids do things on \"dares\". reply barrysteve 14 hours agorootparentprevThere were many things as a kid I shouldn&#x27;t have done and did. Punishment by parasite and horrible death for a strange mistake, is pretty harsh. reply drt5b7j 10 hours agorootparentCan you give me an example of something you shouldn&#x27;t have done and did? I&#x27;m curious to see if I&#x27;m gonna go \"oh you&#x27;re right, I did the same, so silly\". My guess is no. reply barrysteve 9 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s right that the punishment fits the crime, and for a dumb teenager that doesn&#x27;t understand microbiology and parasites, I would cut him some slack.Obviously I can&#x27;t personally ressurect dead kids, but approving of death for ignorant behavioural errors, is a bit beyond the pale. reply drt5b7j 9 hours agorootparentDidn&#x27;t answer my question.Also, I didn&#x27;t approve of anything. I wish it hadn&#x27;t happened. reply blub 5 hours agorootparentprevHe was ~19 years old. If by that time one doesn’t know about microbes, or understands why eating random creatures raw is a bad idea, then they have significant issues.Nobody’s approving anyone’s death either, your insinuations are unjustified. replyh2odragon 19 hours agoprev\"Susceptibility of Angiostrongylus cantonensis Larvae to Anthelmintic Drugs\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC9255552&#x2F;> The macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin, salamectin, moxidectin) and the imidazothiazole levamisole, were the most effective drugs, with IC50 ranging from 2.2 to 2.9 µM and a rapid onset of action. Albendazole, the most widely used anthelmintic in humans, had a slower onset of action, but an IC50 of 11.3 µM was achieved within 24 h.Also mentions \"pyrantel pamoate,\" which i think may be available in pet dewormer formulas. reply dividedbyzero 19 hours agoparentDo these cross the blood-brain barrier?

The part with the roots is \"closed\" so just cut off the tip and rinse a bit. For the end with the leaves you make a 3-4 cm lengthwise cut where the stem ends, then you can hold this part open and rinse under running water. reply emodendroket 17 hours agorootparentIn either case I chop the vegetable up and go through three rounds of submerging, agitating, and straining. Seems to do the job. reply tmpX7dMeXU 11 hours agorootparentprevHah! I’ve got a long way to go. reply jeffbee 19 hours agoparentprevI found a snail, only about 3mm long, in a thoroughly-washed arugula salad I made at home. They can be small enough to be easily overlooked and at the same time large enough to not wash through the holes of a colander, and they may be stuck on the leaves instead of falling out like stones. reply BruceEel 18 hours agorootparentSame here, on multiple occasions. Probably very unscientific of me but I&#x27;m sort of thinking that rucola (arugula) may be more prone to slug hitchhiking than other greens? That&#x27;s in part why I tend to favor watercress, not without its share of nasty parasite risks [1] but have so far never found slugs in it.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;parasites&#x2F;fasciola&#x2F;index.html reply clumsysmurf 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m very thorough with my broccoli washing, and even the most densely packed broccoli florets will have insects right at the point they meet the smallest stem. I essentially stopped worrying about it - assuming - we&#x27;re all eating bugs - maybe lots - and we don&#x27;t see any widespread disease. But now maybe this is about to change, one more thing to add to my laundry list of anxieties :( reply cutemonster 16 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t you boil the broccoli for a while too?

Might not work for all types but it&#x27;s worth a shot reply tegmark 16 hours agoparentprevtwo of my family members are chemists at usda. they dont eat fruit or produce except the kind you can peel like oranges and bananas. plants are covered in feces, worms, pesticides and you cant sit there with a toothbrush scrubbing it all off. a quick rinse isnt going to do shit. especially for the pesticides. also its become clear that most plants arent good for your health even when they arent covered in terrible shit. reply jonahbenton 13 hours agorootparentI am curious for more about their choices but, what? Most plants aren&#x27;t good for your health?If they truly work at USDA they can&#x27;t be of the opinion that most meat in the US is any good...What exactly do they eat? reply tegmark 13 hours agorootparentlol reply drt5b7j 15 hours agorootparentprevGiven that I eat lettuce every day, how come I never got rat lungworm? Am I incredibly lucky? Or is getting it from lettuce incredibly rare? reply calf 14 hours agorootparentThe parasite is mainly in Hawai&#x27;i (it reported said that many Hawai&#x27;ians do not eat salads anymore) and now Florida, expanding northwards in North America.Up in Canada I&#x27;ve been eating my garden leafy greens, but experts say global warming and globalization are involved in the spread.This year they found rat lungworm in Valencia, Spain. Experts are calling this an emerging disease problem, previously confined to tropic and subtropical countries. reply iancmceachern 12 hours agorootparentThis is one good application for indoor&#x2F;vertical farming.Most aren&#x27;t, but this one is.Soon we will all be eating hydroponic lettuce reply tegmark 14 hours agorootparentprevbecause you live in a privileged fairyland. other worms, like those found in pork, are common in countries that dont eliminate them in the food supply. people get sick from drinking tap water. if north america had to drpemd on washing their hands to prevent worms instead of being babied by the gorvernmemt, wed be worse off than india. reply drt5b7j 10 hours agorootparentWestern Europe.

Can anyone comment on the significance of doing this research in a zoo? I&#x27;m guessing it was a crime of opportunity since that&#x27;s where zoologists work and can easily collect dead animals, but what does that mean for the research? Is it likely to be a representative sample of animals in the wild, despite the exposure to exotic animals from all over the world? If they were exposed there and a population established itself among zoo rats, how likely is it to spread from there?What&#x27;s up with that life cycle? Rat to snail seems like a weird combo. Usually parasites&#x27; lifecycle is a little more obvious like Leucochloridium paradoxum which infects snails that are then eaten by birds, who spread the eggs via droppings, or Toxoplasma gondii which gives rats a hankering for cat pee. What&#x27;s the deal with the snails? Did the parasite just evolve in a field somewhere, where snails frequently came into contact with field rat droppings?I wonder how many more pathogens are just waiting for some lucky exposure to break into the human population. Even before COVID brought that idea front and center, I remember going down a wikipedia rabbit hole during the Ebola outbreak and there is some terrifying stuff out there like hendra and nipah viruses with >50% mortality rates. reply yyyk 19 hours agoparent>some terrifying stuff out there like hendra and nipah viruses with >50% mortality rates.These viruses are fortunately self-limiting. We should be terrified when a less deadly variant comes up. reply bbarnett 19 hours agorootparentNot if it gets some covid genes.

It consists of over 250 000 court cases from the UK. Most cases are from the 21st century, but the corpus includes cases as old as the 16th century. This paper presents the first release of the corpus, containing the raw text and meta-data. Together with the corpus, we provide annotations on case outcomes for 638 cases, done by legal experts. Using our annotated data, we have trained and evaluated case outcome extraction with GPT-3, GPT-4 and RoBERTa models to provide benchmarks. We include an extensive legal and ethical discussion to address the potentially sensitive nature of this material. As a consequence, the corpus will only be released for research purposes under certain restrictions.

Pretty much all that kind of data, while supposedly available under the FOIA, is all paywalled by the government or third parties. But it would be interesting to see an AI model. reply chefandy 12 hours agoparentHarvard Law&#x27;s Library Innovation Lab has the Caselaw Access Project— a complete collection of precedential US caselaw with structured metadata. It&#x27;s at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;case.law. It&#x27;s readable online (including the original pdfs for most,) accessible via a rest API in fully structured documents, and through bulk downloads. There are OCR mistakes here and there, but the accuracy is over 99% even with weird things like the \"long s\" that looked like an f that was common before the 20th century. While updates are too slow to replace the commercial tools, it&#x27;s perfect for uses like this... Rather, it will be in a little over 3 months. In Feb of 2018, it was released under agreement with a funder to limit access to 500 cases per day per user for 6 years except for a few jurisdictions available now— so the entire corpus will be completely open then.They scanned, OCR&#x27;d, and applied metadata to 40k volumes, and (digitally) redacted by hand all commercial material (eg head notes, key citations) in all in-copyright volumes, so what&#x27;s left is entirely in the public domain.Disclosure: worked on that project for several years. reply leppert 12 hours agorootparentThanks Andy.

One thing to consider is that official published precedential caselaw is from the appellate level up. From what I understand, lower court cases aren&#x27;t published, though I believe they can be accessed through PACER... But I have no real legal research expertise. The first part of the project entailed a lengthy process involving several decades-experienced legal librarians, lawyers, and archivists mapping out exactly what reporters exist and which ones were \"official\" (considered authoratative by the courts) and when. Apparently nobody had done it before— well, nobody that made their data available, anyway. HLSL is a library of last resort for law and all but a tiny fraction of the books we scanned are in their collection.In the about page there&#x27;s more detailed information about the scope and process. reply riku_iki 7 hours agorootparentthis makes sense, thank you! reply hnfong 12 hours agoparentprevThis one isn&#x27;t even paywalled.

Academic gatekeeper strikes again reply Obscurity4340 12 hours agoparentIts amazing how one-sided the public nature of prosecutions are in the sense that they are entitled to everything that is advantageous to the government&#x2F;harmful to the defendant in the name of the public but they can&#x27;t quite extend that to ensuring the public has the necesary tools to understand, interpret and successfully operate within the domain of, and sometimes (God forbid) \"against\" (in an adversarial, not contravening sense) the law itself by playing within its rules to their own benefit or advantage as they should arguably be fully entitled and empowered to.Assuming its consistent with fundamental justice and precedant (which shouldn&#x27;t really necessarily require an advanced legal education to competently analyse and resynthesize into a case that integrates the facts of the case in question), we should value the abillity of the citizenry and all litigants in general to quickly and easily present an informed meritorious case and not rely on obfuscation or access issues rooted in technology and deficiencies of any given education system to limit participants&#x27; capabillities unduly. reply jstarfish 9 hours agorootparentMaybe it&#x27;s for the best.Once you feed an LLM all case law, answers to questions like \"...so how can I kill my family, collect life insurance on them and get away with it\" become trivial for the plebes to access.As cool as tech advances are, you really don&#x27;t want everyone unlocking the secrets of estate law or nuclear fusion. Some gatekeeping is necessary. reply kmeisthax 9 hours agorootparentI suspect the LLM answer would be \"There is no loophole that would allow you to kill your family for the life insurance money, but if you&#x27;re crafty enough, never tell a soul, and keep the secret to your grave, then there&#x27;s a half chance the case goes cold until your old age, wherein your fifth cousin once removed takes a DNA test that incriminates you, which is good enough.\"Sometimes unlocking the secrets of something isn&#x27;t enough - you need the underlying capital or power to actually pull it off. Normal individuals with normal incomes can&#x27;t build reliably fusion reactors or pull off insurance fraud schemes no matter how much compute or intelligence they have.

Thus, there is no such right articulated in the amendments themselves. Therefore, it&#x27;s decided by case law (which is how all such things are decided in common law systems of jurisprudence). Chief amongst such cases is Griswold v. Connecticut, where the ruling found such a right is established by the constitution through a \"reading between the lines\" (penumbral reasoning).Okay this isn&#x27;t conlaw 101 but my point is privacy and right to privacy are technical terms, possibly unintuitive to you. Now someone&#x27;s rights may have been arrogate here - I don&#x27;t know - but that would be again argued in a court of law. reply flangola7 13 hours agorootparentThis is a very narrow and America-centric viewpoint.

Spider silk provides an environmentally responsible approach to creating substitutes for commercial synthetic fibers like nylon and Kevlar. The research article “High-strength and ultra-tough whole spider silk fibers spun from transgenic silkworms” was published on September 20, 2023, in the Cell Press journal Matter. Tougher than Kevlar, Stronger than Nylon Despite recent significant advancements in polymer fiber science and technology, advanced fibers with truly high tensile strength and ultra-toughness are still needed. However, there is a trade-off between strength and toughness in commercial synthetic fibers. Current theories indicate that the properties of toughness and tensile strength in engineering materials are mutually exclusive. Comparing the well-known fibers Kevlar and nylon, for example, there is a trade-off: while the latter has better tensile strength, the former has higher toughness. As a result, developing supermaterials that meet increasing industrial demands for high strength and ultra-toughness depends on resolving the fundamental scientific problem of combining fiber toughness and strength. There is one exception to this rule: spider silk. However, scientific knowledge about how to induce silkworms to produce spider silk is lacking, which hinders the commercialization of this material. To produce a novel minimal structural model for silk, researchers from Southwest University in Chongqing and Donghua University in Shanghai developed a theoretical framework that elucidates the critical factors influencing fiber strength and toughness. Upon identifying the critical components needed to alter silkworm silk into spider silk, lead author Junpeng Mi and associates then used CRISPR to create silkworms that spun spider silk. The resulting fiber is more than six times tougher than Kevlar and has high tensile strength, surpassing most natural and synthetic fibers like nylon. This accomplishment supports their theory that it is possible to produce spider silk fibers that are exceptionally strong and resilient. This innovation removes barriers in science, technology, and engineering and opens the door for spider silk to be sold as a sustainable alternative to synthetic fibers. This discovery offers important new information for the creation of supermaterials, such as those needed for space elevators, which are imagined to be a kind of transportation that would carry people, satellites, and space stations above Earth’s atmosphere via a robust, thin cable or tether that is anchored to the planet and extends beyond its gravitational pull.

These two properties are typically a trade-off. This means that it can absorb a lot of energy before breaking. Great for sutures, climbing ropes, stopping bullets.For a pressure vessel you want high strength and you don&#x27;t want it to stretch. So the unique property of spider silk is wasted in the application and it&#x27;s outperformed by conventional non-stretchy fibers.If you want a basic understanding, read up on and understand the difference between compressive and tensile yield and ultimate strength (and the specific variations that account for density), toughness, modulus of elasticity, and hardness. reply kylebenzle 13 hours agoparentprevYes, for $1,000,000,000&#x2F;bottle.I imagine silk harvesting is already a difficult process, it being the most expensive natural fabric.

Details in my profile. reply steve_wilson 7 hours agoprevCongrats on the launch!Something I would love to see is an integration with all my messaging apps where I stay in touch with people.Beeper.com offers such functionality (can also be self hosted, which is something I did) and it’s amazing if you can see when you last messaged people, what the content was, etc.Beeper itself is purely built for messaging, so an app like yours would be the perfect companion to give you all the CRM functionality and could then use beeper to send the messages out and log the interactions.The disadvantage if you don’t self-host is though, that you need to trust beeper with your messenger connections.Keep up, this is a super interesting area! reply daniel_sushil 11 hours agoprevJust downloaded it because I do struggle a lot with this problem. When I was single, I was better at keeping in touch with a lot of my friends. After getting married though, I feel like I need to put in effort to still keep in touch because life gets in the way and priorities change.Feedback on the app - I really like the design. Very intuitive. Had no problem getting through my core flow and i’m all set. I do wish you ask for permissions for contact a little later in the flow when i’m actually trying to add people to my list. It will make more sense and it will be more intuitive. I was a little taken back by the permissions dialog right after opening the app even before I got a chance to check out the app. That’s the only thing I would probably change if I was you. reply ddxv 8 hours agoprevWould love for connections to things like LinkedIn, FB Messenger, WhatsApp etc. As someone who lives in a couple countries, I do not use my phone&#x27;s contacts much. reply arwineap 4 minutes agoparentThis is fascinating to meYour contacts are all in disparate systems?Do you have any desire to consolidate them?Is it normal for you to understand that Alice is a \"Facebook friend\" and Bob is an \"Instagram friend\"?With regards to linkedin I imagine these are all \"professional friends\" - are your other friends able to be put into clean buckets like linkedin? reply falqun 16 hours agoprevSo how do you plan to make money? Do you want to move to a subscription based model, do you show in app ads, do you sell data? I cannot find a reference for such information on your website besides maybe your privacy policy. reply Ritepaw 15 hours agoparentWe haven&#x27;t quite figured it out yet. We are a business after all and need to make money at some point. Here is what we decided to not do:* Show ads* Sell dataIn the end it will probably come down to a premium subscription, we have to hash out the details and do some research around it. Would also love to connect with someone in the industry who has experience in creating fair subscription options! reply sneak 17 hours agoprevThank you for not including telemetry or other surveillance in your app. It&#x27;s rare these days and appreciated. reply Ritepaw 15 hours agoparentTbh we were initially looking for a GDPR-compliant telemetry solution cause we thought we need to track something to gauge engagement and retention. I was surprised to see that Google Play Console and App Store Connect give these insights already for free (if the user opts-in). reply wodenokoto 6 hours agoprevI used to have an app that could display my iphones contact list in reverse chronological order.That was very helpful for \"what was the name of that guy I met yesterday at that conference?The app I used has long since been abandoned, and the niche seems littered with scammy apps. reply collinmcnulty 13 hours agoprevMy number one “personal CRM” challenge isn’t getting reminders to call people, it’s remembering things people told me. I’ve taken recently to using the Notes field in Contacts, but something more structured would really be nice. reply smallpipe 16 hours agoprevI wanted something similar so I made myself a list in the Reminders app. I recommend doing it, it’s made keeping up with friends who moved to another country easier. reply Ritepaw 15 hours agoparentI commend you for making this effort! It is such an easy thing to do and so worth it. Is there any specific schema or method behind it? reply ben0x539 14 hours agoprevThis is a weird question to ask but why&#x27;s your website German for me?Edit: Oh, I got it. This submission links to the English version, but the \"the next elim.\" link at the top links to a not specifically English URL, and going from there to any other page gets me to the German version. Huh. reply Ritepaw 14 hours agoparentTime to learn German then ;-) Good find! Let us get this fixed. reply ben0x539 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m German, that&#x27;s why I was spooked! I&#x27;m not in Germany and nothing on my system should be set to German so I was worried you might be applying some sort of mind-reading analytics tech. reply TeMPOraL 4 hours agorootparentEven the order of entries in the Accept-Language header, as per browser settings? That&#x27;s usually the source of half the problems I have with websites suddenly defaulting to an unexpected language.(The other half is websites suddenly displaying in Norwegian; it started after I was in Oslo for a few days and, while there, had to re-activate Skype from the website. Even a decade and two jobs later, on completely unrelated computers, some websites will suddenly display in Norwegian, for reasons completely unknown.) reply ben0x539 4 hours agorootparentNope, I suspected something there too but it turns out I only have en-GB there. reply Ritepaw 13 hours agorootparentprevNo need to worry then, it&#x27;s merely a bug :) reply uoaei 7 hours agoprevDoes anyone receiving these feel like it&#x27;s personal enough to be meaningful? I can&#x27;t help but think that even with some cutesy text, if it wasn&#x27;t exactly the tone of the person who sent it or it didn&#x27;t contain some kind of inside joke, it would just come across as a cookie-cutter afterthought. It seems like the Bitmoji of greeting cards, all splash and no depth.Is the goal to \"exit\" with a sale to Hallmark or something? reply dotcoma 12 hours agoprevWhy is the app categorised (iOS) as “Health & Fitness”?Also: can’t find it if I search for “Elim” in AppStore.Very interested is seeing where this app will go. reply cf141q5325 14 hours agoprevOpening the page the first time it starts at the bottom and i need to scroll up. Opening it a second time it works fine (starts at the top). Behavior replicated with new private window.This isnt an issue worth fixing, just wanted to mention it in case its directly apparent what isnt correctly initialized. I (and i think most others) prefer this over the site not working without javascript. Requiring to unblock a random site is a lot higher hurdle for accessibility then just scrolling up. In all honesty a non issue. reply Ritepaw 14 hours agoparentInteresting... obviously not how it should be. Can you share the browser (and version) you are using? reply cf141q5325 13 hours agorootparentFirefox 117 with adblock and noscript (nothing allowed).Again, this is much preferable over the site not loading. I am not that familiar with web development but it looks like something that isnt initialized correctly (likely set afterwards in js?). Its really not worth putting in the effort to try to debug it if its not obvious.Its pretty clear that its a side effect of the blockers so you shouldnt be worried about bad impressions. I took it as a very good sign that the page just loaded as is anyway, especially given that you are working with quite sensitive information. Anyone with a similar setup will likely take it the same way as they are used to sites not working.This way i was able to look at it, which i wouldnt have if the site required any additional scripts. That should count as a win and a job well done. reply jcrben 14 hours agoprevThe lack of a web app is a deal breaker for me. reply Ritepaw 14 hours agoparentInteresting! We haven&#x27;t thought of it so far but shouldn&#x27;t be too much of an effort to port to the web, given that we use Flutter.Could you elaborate the particular reasons as to why you&#x27;d prefer a web app? (Would a desktop app be relevant as well?) reply jcrben 8 hours agorootparentScreen real estate, ease of linking, etc.No, I don&#x27;t want a desktop app. For one, I use all three os platforms regularly and it&#x27;s just annoying to think about getting it on each. reply kamel3d 8 hours agoparentprevis it possible to have a web app and keep the data in sync with the mobile app without having a server? reply isaacaggrey 12 hours agoprevI appreciate more takes in this space and what elim could be.

I tried Clay, and even pre-paid to get early access, but ended up cancelling one day after I finally got to try it. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. reply flakiness 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been using Monica [1] for the personal CRM and it does what it is supposed to do. It&#x27;s a basic web app and lacks the sophistication moderns apps have, but it hasn&#x27;t died for 5 years at least. Just FYI.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monicahq.com&#x2F; reply Ritepaw 14 hours agoparentWe&#x27;ll check it out. Thank you! reply kstrauser 16 hours agoprevI like this! One request: if you ever go for pay, please don’t get greedy. I don’t mind paying for things, but take Dex for example. I like it, but I’m not paying $145-$240 per year for something I can reimplement badly with Reminders. I just want something to say “hey, don’t forget to say hi to your friend every once in a while” without paying an arm and a leg.For contrast, 6 years ago I paid $80 for Things 3 across all my devices, and it’s still being developed and updated. I’d have a hell of a time paying twice that per year for a vastly simpler app. reply Ritepaw 15 hours agoparentThe core product will remain free. And we will never take anything away that is already out there. reply pedalpete 15 hours agoprevGreat looking app. Though I&#x27;m curious of the origins of the name Elim. It feels like eliminate, but you don&#x27;t want to eliminate people. So maybe you had a different meaning in mind.Beautiful looking app. I&#x27;ll download it when I get a chance.I&#x27;ll be launching an MVP app in the mental health&#x2F;anxiety space next week (currently in TestFlight), so I&#x27;d like to connect and find out a bit about how your experience with your launch, and distribution plans if you&#x27;re up for it (my linkedin is in my profile). reply Ritepaw 15 hours agoparentCopy & paste from the other comment: I have to ask my cofounder about this, as she came up with the name. I remember it meaning something like \"an oasis in the desert\" which is quite fitting to the whole loneliness problem.I&#x27;ll send you an invite! reply morning-coffee 14 hours agoprevIf \"relationships matter\" and you need an app to remind you of that, I&#x27;d posit you have a larger problem than any app can solve. Consider putting down the device and connecting with your peeps in the real world every once in a while. reply kstrauser 13 hours agoparentWhy use a calendar? Just remember everything you have coming up. Why use a to-do app? Just remember all the things you need to do.Life gets busy. I want to drop a note to my distant family regularly, but between work and family and friends and hobbies, sometimes out of sight becomes out of mind. I like having a periodic nudge to ping that far-off person. Today I’m using Things for that, with repeating tasks to text so-and-so periodically. Something that integrates that with a record of what we talked about last time (so I can follow up with them) or alert me on special days would be nice.I do all this because I care about those people and want to make a special effort to keep up with them. If I didn’t care, I wouldn’t be interested. reply beart 14 hours agoparentprevAs an adult deeply involved in my children&#x27;s lives, with a demanding job, and volunteering in local athletics, your comment completely missed the mark. It&#x27;s trivial to lose track of social relationships. reply Ritepaw 14 hours agoparentprevThe way we see it is that most people want to be connected and want to be good friends. But they eithera) Lack the social skills orb) Lack the time management skillsThis is where we want to help. reply jetsnoc 11 hours agoparentprevMight you consider for just a moment, if you will, people who do have a larger problem. People who are neurodivergent who may be challenged with object permanence. Apps like this help greatly. It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t care or we&#x27;re stuck with a device in our face, it&#x27;s that the person doesn&#x27;t exist unless brought to the front and center. reply CatWChainsaw 11 hours agoparentprevSibling comments are rather affronted at this, but I happen to agree that leaning into technology to reclaim what we lost to technology in the first place is not actually solving a problem, it&#x27;s slapping a bandage on and juicing up with some morphine.Technology can&#x27;t give a person more than the set amount of time, energy, and attention they have by virtue of being human. We&#x27;re cramming more and more into our lives, but I doubt that in general we feel more satisfied and fulfilled. You can add and add until you can&#x27;t. At some point you need to subtract. In this community there&#x27;s likely to be at least some stigma around not optimizing every last second of your life, and personally I think that attitude should be stigmatized. It&#x27;s insulting to personal dignity. reply TeMPOraL 4 hours agorootparentBut optimization is exactly what you called for - subtracting things, rearranging things. Because the issue is that we have little choice in how much stuff we have to cram in our lives. That&#x27;s the social problem of technology: it&#x27;s a ratchet.Consider a clock. Why do you need to know what time is it, with minute accuracy? Because you need to synchronize in time with other people. Why do you need that? Because everyone else does that and it&#x27;s now a basic part of how society functions. You owning a clock is a default expectation.How did it came to be this way? The first clocks invented weren&#x27;t very useful for this (they were for navigation at sea, though), because approximately no one had them. But then someone put clocks on church towers and someone else miniaturized them, and at some point we crossed from it being a convenience to it being necessity.Same story with calendars, todo lists, having a phone at home, having a phone in your pocket, having a bank account. Emerging additions to this list include having credit&#x2F;debit cards, having smartphones, having social media accounts. Individually, we can do little about it; at some point, resisting costs more than giving in. reply CatWChainsaw 1 hour agorootparentI think we&#x27;re agreeing just from different angles. We seem to have the same opinion about the veritable rat race of being forced to juggle ever more things, because technology. It seems that where we&#x27;re not agreeing is &#x27;optimizing&#x27;. IMO the end goal of optimization is to do as much as possible, which is additive. I can see on a personal level some optimizing might be subtractive, but for society as a whole I don&#x27;t think so. reply edoardo-schnell 17 hours agoprevOk but why call it \"eliminate\"? Sry the bluntness reply TeMPOraL 17 hours agoparentI read it as Elim, as in Elim Garak, a famous tailor from a relatively well-known sci-fi show.That isn&#x27;t really any better in terms of connotations, though. reply Ritepaw 15 hours agorootparentEveryone&#x27;s favourite station tailor has no part in this (sadly) ;-)I have to ask my cofounder about this, as she came up with the name.

of Mrs Agatha Christie Friday 11 February 2022Katherine HowellsRecords and research8 comments This blog article is part of the 20sPeople season – a season of exhibitions, activities and events from The National Archives that explores and shares stories that connect the people of the 2020s with the people of the 1920s. With today’s release of the new film adaptation of Agatha Christie’s 1937 novel, Death on the Nile, I’m taking another look at one of the most bizarre events in the famous crime novelist’s life. On the evening of Friday 3 December 1926, Agatha Christie left her home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, got into her car and disappeared into the night. Her disappearance sparked a manhunt involving the police, members of the public and famous figures and was lapped up by the tabloid press. This strange series of events was worthy of her own works of fiction; however, unlike the mysteries solved by Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, this one was never fully explained. Records held at The National Archives give us a unique insight into the strange events of December 1926. Agatha Christie’s career was at its height at the end of 1926. Her sixth novel, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, had been published earlier that year and her first collection of short stories featuring the character of Hercule Poirot had been published two years previously. Christie’s personal life was less happy, however. Her husband Archibald Christie (Archie) had been having an affair with a woman called Nancy Neele and in August, he asked Agatha for a divorce. Following an argument between husband and wife on 3 December, Archie left to spend the weekend with friends. Later that night Agatha kissed her daughter Rosalind goodnight as she lay sleeping, left the house and drove away in her Morris Cowley. The next day, the car was discovered abandoned above a chalk quarry at Newlands Corner, and some of her clothes were found inside. The police reported that: ‘The car was found in such a position as to indicate that some unusual proceeding had taken place, the Car being found half-way down a grassy slope well off the main road with its bonnet buried in some bushes, as if it had got out of control. In the Car was found a Fur Coat, a Dressing Case containing various articles of ladies wearing apparel, and a driving licence indicating that the owner was Mrs. Agatha Christie of Sunningdale, Berks.’ The National Archives, Agatha Christie: search by police and civilian volunteers when her car was found abandoned, 1927. Catalogue ref: HO 45/25904 Marriage certificate of Agatha and Archibald Christie, 14 December 1914. Catalogue ref: J 77/2492/7646 Many assumed the worst, and a police investigation began to find the missing woman. A man who had seen Agatha Christie that night reported that she was ‘sparsely dressed for such an inclement morning, and that she appeared strange in her manner.’ 1 The disappearance was also widely reported in the newspapers, and concerned members of the public joined the search. Journalists put forward a range of theories to explain her disappearance. Some suggested she had drowned herself, others that she had been murdered by her husband. And still others claimed the whole turn of events was nothing more than a publicity stunt to promote her novels. Some prominent figures joined the efforts to find her. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a keen spiritualist, even consulted a medium to attempt to solve the mystery of her disappearance. 2 The Daily Mirror, 7 December 1926. Digitised by Findmypast Newspaper Archive Limited. The British Newspaper Archive Finally, 11 days later on the 14 December, a member of the public recognised her staying at the Swan Hydro hotel in Harrogate. She had checked in under the name of her husband’s mistress. She was suffering with memory loss and could give no account of the preceding 11 days or any reasons for her actions. Her biographer Andrew Norman argues that she was in a ‘fugue’ state caused by trauma or depression 3; however, others still believed that her actions were deliberate and perhaps designed to cause distress and embarrassment to her husband. Following Christie’s reappearance, there were concerns in some quarters that the police response had been excessive and that time and money had been wasted on the search for her. This was partly due to inaccurate press reports that aeroplanes, divers and multiple police forces had been involved. On 25 February, Mr Neil Maclean, MP for Glasgow Govan, put a question to the Home Secretary asking for information on ‘the number of the Metropolitan police specially detailed for the search for Mrs Agatha Christie; the time occupied; and the total cost, including the wages of the officers so detailed.’ 4 Documents relating to this question can be found in a Home Office file held at The National Archives. The written answer from the Home Secretary was that ‘No members of the Metropolitan Police were specially detailed for the purpose, and no cost was incurred by the Metropolitan Police. A description of the missing person was published in Information in the usual way.’ 5 Letter from William Kenward to the Home Office, 9 February 1927. Catalogue ref: HO 45/25904 This response was informed by a letter from the Deputy Chief Constable of the Surrey Constabulary, William Kenward, dated 9 February 1927. In it, he detailed the actions taken by the police in response to the disappearance and made clear that press reports had exaggerated the actual police response. ‘The number of police said to have been engaged has been greatly exaggerated, and I received invaluable assistance from the public generally. The aeroplanes which are said to have taken part in the search are nothing to do with the police. There is no doubt that a good deal of press matter circulated in connection with the case was without foundation.’ He also explained why the actions taken were justified by the potential danger that the missing woman could have faced following her disappearance. ‘The lady disappeared under circumstances which opened out all sorts of possibilities – she might have been wandering with loss of memory over that vast open country around Newlands Corner, or she might have fallen down one of the numerous gravel pits that abound there and are covered in most instances with undergrowth and lying helpless in agony, or she might have been as was strongly suggested to the police, the victim of a serious crime. Under no circumstances could the police of this district have justified any inaction in the matter.’ Agatha’s husband, Archie Christie, responded to enquiries about his wife’s state of mind by explaining that she was suffering from a nervous disorder and memory loss. The police approached him to request a contribution towards police costs, but he refused saying it was ‘entirely a police matter’. 6 Agatha Christie in the 1921 Census, visiting friends in Clewer, Windsor It may never be known whether Agatha Christie’s disappearance was due to the psychological effects of the depression she was suffering from, or whether there were other reasons. However, the breakdown of her marriage to Archie Christie was no doubt a traumatic experience. The couple finally divorced in 1928 and Archie went on to marry his mistress, Nancy Neele.

Catalogue ref: J 77/2492/7646 The sudden disappearance of Agatha Christie in December 1926 gave the British public a real-life taste of the kind of mystery she had shared with them in her stories. And this probably explains why the incident caught the imagination of so many at the time. Despite this dramatic episode in her life, Agatha Christie went on to continued success in crime fiction, going on to publish over 60 more novels and numerous short stories. She is still today the best-selling novelist of all time, having sold over a billion copies of her books in the English language 7. Her wonderful stories, along with their many television and film adaptions, have brought joy to millions around the world. 20sPeople at The National Archives 20sPeople at The National Archives explores and shares stories that connect the people of the 2020s with the people of the 1920s.

This was partly due to inaccurate press reports that helicopters and multiple police forces had been involved.” These reports might have been easily debunked, as helicopters were not invented until over a decade later. Reply Richard Tue 15 Feb 2022 at 7:33 am … and drove away in her Morris Crowley. Gremlins have got into at this post. Agatha’s car was a Morris Cowley. Reply Richard Tue 15 Feb 2022 at 8:14 am This post uses direct quotes from documents within the National Archives. The author uses the word ‘helicopters’ when quoted source material from the Deputy Chief Constable of Surrey Constabulary states: The aeroplanes which are said to have taken part in the search… As LeifFraNorden points out helicopters are a type of aeroplane, but all aeroplanes are not helicopters. I suspect that – not for the first time on this blog as I have previously pointed out that Second World War RAF aircrew did not ‘eject’ from their stricken aircraft and others have drawn attention to other mistakes – authors project today’s processes and procedures on past events. The military describe this condition (in a somewhat convoluted way) as ‘situating the appreciation and not appreciating the situation’ – that is using past experience (the appreciation) to slot into a current set of circumstances and to override ignore often vital facts that different from the ‘appreciation’. While no one will (hopefully) face the same circumstances as soldiers in combat when reading this or other posts on this blog, such practices damage the reputation of the National Archives and it’s very knowledgeable staff. They also run the risk of perpetuating inaccurate information when quoted by others. Hopefully deadlines for posting will not override basic fact checking in the future. Reply Katherine Howells Tue 15 Feb 2022 at 3:38 pm My sincere apologies for those errors. Thank you for making me aware of them – they have now been corrected. Reply Richard Wed 16 Feb 2022 at 8:50 am Thank you Katherine for your prompt action and acknowledgement. You are not alone in these type of slips, but not everyone posts on the National Archives blog! Reply Andrew Harper Sat 24 Dec 2022 at 10:13 am Given that Christie’s car was found in Surrey, how did she then travel from Silent Pool to Harrogate? This question seems never to have been asked. Has any explanation been offered? Reply Linda Togliatti Mon 23 Jan 2023 at 8:46 pm I am curious about the 3 letters Agatha supposedly left before she disappeared. 1 to her secretary, 1 to Archie and 1 to her brother in law. Did they actually exist or were the creative liberties taken by authors? If they existed, are there copies and what did they say? Reply Marni Graff Fri 15 Sep 2023 at 7:09 am The three letters appear to have been real. See Laura Thompson’s excellent biography AGATHA CHRISTIE: A Mysterious Woman for footnoted information.

I just cycled up that hill earlier today and it wasn&#x27;t fun. There are a few photos around [0] from the original incident.However, the whole thing is fairly universally assumed to have been a publicity stunt. This is a fairly well known story locally. Here&#x27;s a local tabloid [1] with a few original newspaper articles, and a sprinkling of sensationalism for good measure.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prints-online.com&#x2F;agatha-christies-abandoned-mot... [1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsurrey.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;nostalgia&#x2F;agatha-christies-... reply throwanem 17 hours agoparentBit silly as a publicity stunt, I&#x27;d think. But presumably that photo was taken after her car had been recovered, because the incident report describes it being piled nose-first into undergrowth not evident here. That suggests the accident started with a loss of control - which, at night on an unlit road in a century-old deathtrap like that one, wouldn&#x27;t just be easy to do but likely quite hard to avoid.I&#x27;ve been in enough car wrecks, and those in modern cars, for it to strike me as arrantly foolish no one ever seems to consider the possibility she got her bell rung. Even an airbag will do that sometimes - I&#x27;ve had two of those go off in my face, and one of them did exactly that; it&#x27;s more than anything else like taking a hard, well-aimed punch, and even if it does save you ending up with much worse, you still are liable not to be thinking right for a while after. And that&#x27;s with a hundred years of safety engineering! Christie&#x27;s car wouldn&#x27;t even have had seatbelts or safety glass - it&#x27;s got to be at least half a miracle she made it out alive. reply kQq9oHeAz6wLLS 11 hours agorootparent> But presumably that photo was taken after her car had been recovered, because the incident report describes it being piled nose-first into undergrowth not evident here.Also, that doesn&#x27;t appear to be a Morris Cowley. It&#x27;s much too tall, and the grill is all wrong. That&#x27;s likely a police vehicle. reply ComputerGuru 19 hours agoprevQuite the story! I never heard about this before, and I’m a huge fan (admittedly that’s fan of the books though, rather than the author herself). The story&#x2F;novel mentioned in the article (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) is famous in literary circles for $reasons - if you haven’t read it and you enjoy reading that sort of book, you’re missing out!(It does look like she staged a murder scene from her books intending to frame her husband then came to her senses, doesn’t it?) reply ruph123 19 hours agoparentI have read similar recommendations about the book and read it because of those.The problem is that if you recommend the book for it&#x27;s \"unique plot twist\", the reader will keep looking for clues on how the resution may not be the most obvious and figure it out pretty fast. Then it is actually no surprise at all anymore. At least this happenend to me.It would serve the book better if it was recommended as a great (but traditional) murder mystery novel and that&#x27;s it. reply hackernewds 19 hours agorootparentHey that&#x27;s a very good point. My friends often will say \"just wait for the twist\" and are confounded why that is a spoiler reply ComputerGuru 19 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a fair point. I&#x27;ve lightly edited my recommendation accordingly :)I read it making my way down a random list of \"greatest books of the 20th century\" without any expectations; I should probably offer others the same courtesy. reply genter 18 hours agorootparentprevTBH, most of her books have the common theme of the murderer is the last person you&#x27;d expect. Although admittedly Ackroyd is the most extreme example. reply truculent 11 hours agorootparentprevI’d recommend you take a look at the book “Who Murdered Roger Ackroyd?” if you want a slightly different take on the book and its twist reply jstarfish 4 hours agoparentprev> It does look like she staged a murder scene from her books intending to frame her husband then came to her senses, doesn’t it?That was never going to work. The husband had an alibi, and the daughter was present. Christie would have known that.She used the mistress&#x27; name when checking into a hotel, which implicated her in the incident. If Christie intended to frame anybody for anything, it&#x27;d be her.It looks to me like she intended to leave, considered suicide, aborted the attempt, then tried to improvise a vague story for wrecking the car. I don&#x27;t believe the fugue-state part. reply throwanem 17 hours agoparentprev> It does look like she staged a murder scene from her books intending to frame her husband then came to her senses, doesn’t it?Sure, if that&#x27;s what you want to see. Or if the tabloid journalists of the day, who even by contemporary standards behaved themselves professionally with serene disregard for anything resembling honesty or morality, think it&#x27;ll sell more papers to make it look like that. reply OscarCunningham 19 hours agoprevThe &#x27;fugue state&#x27; seems very unlikely to me. I&#x27;d guess that Agatha had some plot against her husband, and then used that as an excuse when things didn&#x27;t go as planned.What the plot was though, I have no idea. It looks like she was framing him for her murder, but that would involve her going missing permanently. Which is both a big sacrifice and very hard to pull off when you are Agatha Christie. reply toyg 16 hours agoparentImho it looks more like a \"look how easy it would be for me to kill myself, if you don&#x27;t stop seeing that little whore\". reply DoreenMichele 11 hours agoprevOh, we seem to project modern attitudes on historic events. At that time, a divorce for any reason was a scandal.I can well imagine she just left, embarrassed, ashamed, confused, no plan, no internet in the palm of her hand to ask it what to do. reply computator 19 hours agoprevThe headline in the Daily Mirror in the article says, \"Mystery of Woman Novelist&#x27;s Disappearance\", which tells me that she was much less famous in 1926 than she is today. Any headline about her today would have used her name (just as the feature article and the Hacker News title did). reply ycan 18 hours agoprev> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a keen spiritualist, even consulted a medium to attempt to solve the mystery of her disappearance.This bit was the most surprising part of the article for me, given the themes of science and materialism in Sherlock Holmes books. Looking a bit into it, Doyle really seems to have been into Spiritualism for some bizarre reason [0].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arthurconandoyle.co.uk&#x2F;spiritualist reply gumby 17 hours agoparentConan Doyle was into a lot of pseudoscientific stuff and it runs through his Holmes stories. He didn&#x27;t think of it as \"pseudo-\" at all so just presented it as run of the mill science, like the hoary \"10% of your brain\" nonsense. Holmes&#x27; \"reasoning\" processes were often pretty dubious too.I read those stories as a kid (we had a huge single volume for some reason) and tried to figure out how to emulate Holmes&#x27; thinkings so I could be as smart as him (and not be the hapless Watson). That resulted in quite a bit of time in the library chasing things down which caused me to learn that things in books aren&#x27;t always true and that adults were often idiots. So I can&#x27;t say that reading Sherloc Holmes stories were bad for me, but the process destroyed any interest I had in anything Holmes related. reply emodendroket 17 hours agorootparentReally? Most of the stories are well done even if not every bit of his \"ratiocination\" holds up. I feel like one can enjoy them for what they are without trying to take them as real-life forensic science. reply tetris11 16 hours agorootparentIt just sits a bit bitter when you used to look at him as an unconventional man who employed the scientific process of deduction to solve his cases.... only for you to later realise that he was applying abductive reasoning the whole time, whilst claiming otherwise and chasing down any lead like a mad dog. Holmes wasn&#x27;t smart, just driven. reply emodendroket 12 hours agorootparentWasn’t the whole concept of detective work fairly new when the books were being written? The earliest Holmes stories are quite indebted to Poe’s work with C. Auguste Dupin and he invented the form. reply krapp 15 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s one of the problems with mystery writing - the protagonist can never be smarter than the author. The books can say Sherlock Holmes is a genius polymath intellect with brilliant deductive capabilities but he was written by a guy who believed the Cottingley Fairies were real, so... reply the_af 14 hours agorootparentprevI really like Sherlock stories, but yes, they are seldom all that rational.I remember in one story Sherlock concludes a man must be smart because his hat size is large. I mean, come on, even in Doyle&#x27;s time this would have raised more than one eyebrow.I don&#x27;t hold this against the stories because my enjoyment of them is more about the mystery and Sherlock as a character, rather than they actually making rational sense. reply tomcam 17 hours agoparentprevEven more interesting is the fact that he and Harry Houdini were friends, but they were split over the life after death question. Houdini was sick of all the charlatans, and made the focus of his life’s work in his final years to prove them wrong. It obviously created a wedge between them.Houdini by that time was a megastar. He was easily the most famous person in the western world for about a generation. His fame dwarfed that of people like Doyle, Agatha Christie, or Oscar Wilde. reply mongol 16 hours agorootparentWas he more famous than Chaplin? reply TylerE 16 hours agorootparentTheir careers mostly didn’t overlap. There were a few years, but Houdini was earlier.Even given that, I’d say yes.The thing about Houdini was not just that he was famous M, but he really didn’t have any competition.Chaplin, even at the height of his fame, there were others that weren’t far behind (Buster Keaton, say) reply mongol 16 hours agorootparentThat argument seems to depend on how famous he was relative other celebrities. But in absolute numbers, how many people knew about them, I think should count higher. reply TylerE 9 hours agorootparentThere is no objective, absolute measure of fame. replyn3storm 18 hours agoparentprevAt that time \"mesmerism\" was sold as possible new branch of science that will properly explain after life, ghost, etc. without religion.Obviously was a reboot&#x2F;remake&#x2F;remix \"product\" perfectly crafted for a new public as sceptics like Sir Conan Doyle. reply babyshake 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s easy in hindsight to see these types of things as being ridiculous and obviously bunk. We do have the equivalents today, although YMMV on what you think is the modern day \"mesmerism\". reply the_af 14 hours agorootparentWhy wouldn&#x27;t today&#x27;s \"mesmerisms\" be just as ridiculous? I don&#x27;t think the mockery is about \"absurd things people back then believed\" but about \"gullible people who will believe all sorts of things\".I think Conan Doyle was a very gullible man for his time. He would have been gullible for today&#x27;s quakery if he was still alive. reply vajrabum 17 hours agorootparentprevMaybe, but the chronology is a little off--Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) famous for mesmerism (hypnosis). reply the_af 14 hours agoparentprevArthur Conan Doyle famously embarrassed himself with the Cottingley Fairies fake [1]. A grown man, believing in fairies -- small women with butterfly wings -- based on some dodgy (doctored) photographs. He went beyond believing in them; he actually promoted the case.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cottingley_Fairies reply standardUser 13 hours agorootparentThat Wikipedia page is worth the read. It&#x27;s amazing how many people they duped! The photos are unedited but they include cardboard cutouts. It&#x27;s immediately obvious to my 21st Century eyes that the fairies are drawings, but apparently they fooled a lot of people.The 5th photo is the only one that doesn&#x27;t look immediately like a cutout. It&#x27;s believed to have been the result of a double exposure, but one of the women maintained until her death that the 5th photo was genuine.The photos: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sothebys.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;buy&#x2F;auction&#x2F;2020&#x2F;english-literat... reply the_af 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t laugh at the technology itself -- today those photos look ridiculous but I believe people could find them realistic back then.The dumb thing is believing fairies exist at all. If I see \"convincing\" evidence of fairies, with today&#x27;s technology, I would still remain skeptical. It would take a lot more for me to even begin to wonder. Because fairies don&#x27;t exist, we know where they come from in folklore and literature, and there&#x27;s so much evidence they don&#x27;t exist (along with unicorns, the Yeti, gremlins, etc) that a couple of convincing photographs or videos is simply not enough.Conan Doyle wouldn&#x27;t have been fooled had he been a skeptical, inquiring mind. Alas! He was just gullible.Famously, Conan Doyle had Sherlock claim:> When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.Unfortunately Doyle, because he so wanted to believe, didn&#x27;t really eliminate the impossible. He carelessly dismissed the most obvious option: that the two girls were playing him for a fool. reply galaxyLogic 13 hours agorootparentYes but we must also consider what he thought would be the benefit of promoting the fairy stories for him? Of course, fame. The famous person who discovered and proved to the world that fairies exist.Doyle was not a scientist but he admired scientists, discoverers of truths and he desired to be one. He also desired that other people should believe him, that would give him great power.Think about all those conspiracy theories floating in US today, why do people spread them? It&#x27;s a Ponzi-scheme, the originators of a conspiracy get great power by having many followers who believe them.The other side of it is that of course people want to believe great stories that might prove to them afterlife will be better than the current one.

We know it to be mostly false today, but it really did help develop chemistry. reply the_af 14 hours agorootparentprevAlchemy was always quackery. It might have been proto-chemistry, but the minute it adopted scientific method it stopped being alchemy.The problem with alchemy is that there was no rhyme or reason to its method, other than mysticisim; it wasn&#x27;t scientific in nature.If it sparked chemistry, that&#x27;s a good thing; but it doesn&#x27;t stop it from being quakery. reply pests 16 hours agorootparentprevWe live in an age of technical marvel but the goalposts have constantly shifted so nothing feels amazing anymore. reply krapp 15 hours agorootparentprevExcept the alchemists weren&#x27;t practicing nuclear physicists, nor did they actually ever turn lead into gold through nuclear fission, nor would anything in their philosophy have led to doing so, either in theory or practice.Just because it happens to be physically possible to turn lead into gold using a model that alchemists would never have even comprehended (as their principles were based on hermeticism and religion, not experimental science) doesn&#x27;t mean they weren&#x27;t quacks, or that they were half right.

The sources&#x2F;purposes of the relevant books explain most inconsistencies already (namely that most Jewish law doesn&#x27;t apply to gentiles, because Jesus was a new covenant with all peoples.)Gospel harmonies deal with the biggest hole: The gospels don&#x27;t have any reason to be inconsistent. But that&#x27;s easy to respond to too: They were written in response to other writings, each other and popular ideas, in dialogue with each other, just as the \"historical\" books etc. or modern history books and internet comments are made in dialogue with each other. Christians say this approaches truth, where the order of events of Jesus&#x27; thorning are less relevant than his message of love etc.This lens leads to many interesting readings, e.g. the bible can be seen as a vengeful god killing off other gods (by his chosen people killing worshipers of other gods) and then learning to be nice and instead choosing all peoples. reply svieira 12 hours agorootparentprevChristianity is based on the conversation between God and His chosen people from the creation of the world until now, with that conversation moving towards and flowing from the Incarnation, Passion, Death, and Resurrection of the Second Person of the Trinity. Part of which is in the Bible (everything is not in the Bible alone - e. g. the list of the books of the Bible isn&#x27;t in the Bible)Mere Christianity by Lewis is a pretty good introduction to the idea, as is Orthodoxy by G.

Along with Mao&#x27;s book, all of these share the characteristic of being propaganda, in the modern and&#x2F;or original senses of the word, literally.Of individual books with a known author: Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes (>500 million), A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens (>200 million), and The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery (~200 million) top the list. Rowling and Christie are 4th and 5th on that list.Rowling tops the list for book series (500 million), followed by R.L.

The travel productivity cost to society is astronomical. Like, literally everyone would be better off if the TSA paid people to just stay home and do absolutely nothing at all. The current employees would have their time back, the travelers would have their time back, and travel security would be no worse in any statistically meaningful sense. But the US has a huge contingent of people fundamentally opposed to doing things like this even when it would make literally everything better for literally everyone.So here we are. reply snake_doc 20 hours agoparentThe effectiveness of a security program cannot solely be measured by penetration tests under controlled circumstances. Aspects of deterrence and standardization required by the program fundamentally changes the threat actors’ calculus.This is the very fundamentals of mixed strategy calculations in game theory. reply devilbunny 20 hours agorootparentWhile this is true, the method of 11 September 2001 worked for less than two hours. It is effectively impossible to hijack an airplane now, because the passengers will assume that they&#x27;re dead either way and will do anything they can to stop you. You can still blow them up a la Lockerbie, but that&#x27;s about it.I really don&#x27;t see a meaningful reason for most of \"security screening\" anymore. It just slows things down. reply master_crab 20 hours agorootparentTrue, and even two hours maybe pushing it. The crash in PA on 9&#x2F;11 was a direct result of passengers attacking the cockpit after they found out what happened to the other planes. reply devilbunny 18 hours agorootparentThat was my point. Sorry it wasn’t clear. reply nelsondev 20 hours agorootparentprevOr being shot down by a fighter jet. reply qchris 19 hours agorootparentIt might be worth doing some reading on the actual events of that day. For example, \"being shot down by a fighter jet\" wasn&#x27;t an option; the fighters weren&#x27;t armed when they were put up in the sky. The pilots in them went up knowing that if a plane needed to be taken out, they were going to be using themselves to do it. And none of that is to mention the passengers the parent comment was referring to, who made the conscious, heroic decision that their plane wasn&#x27;t going to be used as a weapon like two previous ones had been, whatever the cost.I don&#x27;t mean to assume bad faith, but this was, at best, a throwaway comment that minimized the bravery and sacrifice of a lot of good people. Either way, I&#x27;d like to recommend you educate yourself a bit more. The Wikipedia page has some excellent detail, and if narrative structure is your thing, the book The Only Plane In The Sky is a masterpiece on the subject. reply gatlin 13 hours agorootparent> weren&#x27;t armed when they went upHow has this claim been authenticated? reply tmpX7dMeXU 11 hours agorootparentFrom the government itself? You can listen to unclassified &#x2F; declassified 9&#x2F;11-related communications (all over YouTube) and literally hear the conversations happening. The pilots have done interviews. There’s really no questioning it. It’s part of the US being woefully unprepared for 9&#x2F;11 because it was so left of field. All evidence points to a lot of brave people doing their absolute best, working within a system that didn’t know how to handle the circumstance. That includes not being prepared to take down a commercial airliner at short notice, because why the hell would anyone ever need to do that!? (no sarcasm intended). replywordsarelies 20 hours agorootparentprevTruth, the primary impact was the ability to arbitrarily inflate the cost of soft goods dramatically inside the terminal.It&#x27;s such a good racket Hudson News...a little news stand company inside a few dozen terminals was able to go public on the NYSE...The public perception that security is \"doing it&#x27;s job\" is non-existent since everyone knows it&#x27;s at best a jobs program and in practice another group of people measurably stealing travellers things. reply snake_doc 15 hours agorootparentHudson News is a brand for its Swiss parent company, Dufry.Dufry existed prior to the invention of the airplane… reply canjobear 20 hours agorootparentprevClassic example of the Lucas Critique. reply yowzadave 20 hours agorootparentprevHow do you propose measuring the effectiveness of the program? reply 13of40 19 hours agorootparentI was going to suggest comparing it to other developed countries&#x27; practices vs their rate of high profile terrorist attacks, but then I realized it correlates the other way.

You will achieve near 100% success.However, when the traffic lights change actors’ behaviors to stop (at some probability such that it results in less collisions), most actors will stop according to the traffic lights. reply RiceRichardJ 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not a good analogy at all. The incentives and motivations are completely different. Many drivers would at one point or another consider running a red light in order to save some time.

I&#x27;ve talked to many people over the years who are genuinely worried about terrorists and they believe that the TSA protects them. You can cite all the statistics in the world to them, and it won&#x27;t matter. They are not rational on this topic. They will view \"get rid of the TSA\" as a huge negative impact to their safety, and will vehemently oppose it with or without the paying agents to stay home.I do think that paying people to stay home instead of doing make-work is relatively unpopular in the US, so that doesn&#x27;t help. But the biggest problem you will face is just that people don&#x27;t want to get rid of the TSA no matter how you do it. The TSA is very unpopular in tech&#x2F;geek circles (and for good reason), but I&#x27;ve found it to be quite popular with normies. reply sokoloff 19 hours agorootparent> paying people to stay home instead of doing make-work is relatively unpopular in the USI think that&#x27;s a significant understatement of the prevailing condition. reply hodgesrm 20 hours agoparentprevThe TSA stats show that they found 6,542 firearms in carry-on luggage at US airports last year.

Shouldn’t we be more worried about all the children of the rich who will never need to earn a living? Shouldn’t we make them all do labor, for the good of their own souls? reply philwelch 20 hours agorootparentIf they were capable of doing actually productive tasks, they would get a job somewhere other than the TSA. It’s more a question of structure and routine than “dignity of work”, and the type of person who can have structure and routine in their life without a job has enough agency that they wouldn’t be working for the TSA either.> Shouldn’t we be more worried about all the children of the rich who will never need to earn a living?We should be worried about those people because they tend to die from drug abuse much more frequently than the general population. The same is true for washed up celebrities and lottery winners. In fact, this is something that rich people tend to worry about a lot in regard to their own children. reply yowzadave 19 hours agorootparent> If they were capable of doing actually productive tasks, they would get a job somewhere other than the TSAThis statement seems bonkers to me. People work at the TSA because they need money. Anybody who can hold down a job at the TSA would be entirely capable of doing many productive tasks that may not be remunerative, such as child care, elder care, care for the disabled, any number of home&#x2F;landscape maintenance tasks, home construction, etc. Not to mention all of the activities that people do to add value to their lives and those around them: contributing the community, making art&#x2F;music, etc. reply philwelch 13 hours agorootparent> Anybody who can hold down a job at the TSA would be entirely capable of doing many productive tasks that may not be remunerative, such as child care, elder care, care for the disabled, any number of home&#x2F;landscape maintenance tasks, home construction, etc.Those are literally all remunerative jobs. reply kortilla 20 hours agorootparentprevEveryone pretty much assumed the children of the rich will be spoiled and entitled drags on society.

You aren&#x27;t allowed to bring a clear bottle of water, but you are allowed to bring fish in your carry on. Freeze that water, or put a fish in that bottle of water, and it is allowed, because you&#x27;re transporting live fish! I was going through a checkpoint a few weeks ago and forgot a filled, reusable water bottle in my backpack. Instead of just letting me dump the bottle out and proceed, the TSA handler made me go to the back of the line and go through the entire checkpoint, body scanner etc again. If I had just brought a fish with me, I could have avoided the whole thing.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07VN5LRYQ No longer for sale, but there are similar ones reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparentI actually have a walking stick with a removable end knob that exposes a tripod screw. However I assume I wouldn’t convince any TSA agent that the item in question was not in fact a walking stick. (Also not sure it gets short enough to fit in carryon. reply gamblor956 19 hours agorootparentprevFish are allowed in small bottles of water (though filled \"water\" bottles are not) because the presence of a living fish in the liquid is a pretty clear indicator that the liquid in the bottle is water, and not something else like explosives. reply jlund-molfese 19 hours agorootparentBut the TSA presumably already has a way to tell whether a liquid is an explosive—and it doesn&#x27;t involve fish.The TSA allows for breast milk and \"toddler drinks\" to be brought on board, with or without children present.They also allow contact lens solution, liquid medication, and, during covid-19, hand sanitizer (an accelerant!). reply flangola7 20 hours agorootparentprevLink gives me an Amazon dog reply kingforaday 20 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tsa.gov&#x2F;travel&#x2F;security-screening&#x2F;whatcanibring&#x2F;...Since the final decision rests with the TSA officer.. maybe.. just maybe you can sweet talk them and they&#x27;ll allow it since it is _just_ a hiking pole.Otherwise, agree.

They were foam, as in pool noodle foam, and they were used for training.I was blocked and told I&#x27;d have to check the bag. I did and missed the flight, so my partner picked up the bag (free shipping!) and I stayed home that weekend.The TSA is such a joke. The fact that they can&#x27;t even make determinations without leaving the, \"The final decision rests with the TSA officer on whether an item is allowed through the checkpoint\" disclaimer shows it&#x27;s all pretend, made up bull. reply ethanbond 20 hours agoparentOr it shows how insanely hard it is to make a flowchart to deal with actual reality. Here, try this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;novehiclesinthepark.com&#x2F;Then imagine a rule set as complicated as “all rules required to ensure safe air travel” being redteamed by a population of a billion people with incentives varying from “personal convenience” to “fly into an occupied skyscraper” to “move ten pounds of cocaine.”Now make that rule set enforceable by tens of thousands of people in a time and cost-effective manner.Deferring a lot of authority to a somewhat sensible person on the ground is the only plausible approach. reply kortilla 20 hours agorootparent> from “personal convenience” to “fly into an occupied skyscraper” to “move ten pounds of cocaine.”The TSAs job shouldn’t be preventing drug trafficking. What’s next? They check everything with serial numbers to ensure no stolen goods are being carried? reply ethanbond 19 hours agorootparentI don’t think the TSA does try to prevent drug trafficking, but I do suspect that you cannot (and should not be able to) just stuff a suitcase full of cocaine and walk it through the Precheck line.At a certain point that’s a legitimate safety issue. reply lostlogin 19 hours agorootparentprevYou’ve touched on my issue with it - it’s an American organisation in America. Yet the TSA bullshit is contagious annf other countries have subscribed. It also makes things like passing through the US painful. reply ethanbond 19 hours agorootparentYeah I guess the sensible thing for every other western nation would’ve been to watch the innovation of “plane hijackers are now both murderous and suicidal” and not make some changes to their security regime.Also, yeah, air travel is a global system. Are you proposing that we just let people fly from other countries with no security infrastructure to the US? And your view is that this somehow makes sense? reply lostlogin 19 hours agorootparentDo you feel the TSA makes you safer?My issue is mainly that the security crap is applied when there is no connection to the US occurring.If that poor security theatre stayed within US borders it would be more palatable to us outsiders, then we could make adjustments for that and carry on. reply ethanbond 19 hours agorootparentIt’s so goofy when foreigners think the US is forcing other countries to do x y z things, like “have airport security.”Your airports have security because your leaders learned the same things on 9&#x2F;11 that the US did. The threat landscape changed immensely. Hijackings were not super uncommon, but they were never that dangerous because it’s hard to do much damage without killing yourself too.What 9&#x2F;11 revealed is that there are actually people who can be convinced to fly themselves into buildings on loaded aircraft, and yes I do think “there will be bomb dogs” and “there will be X-rays” etc are factored into bad actors’ thinking about how to commit bad actions.Or, you know, I suppose you could think that there were only 19 people in the whole wide world who would’ve possibly done what they did and luckily we got rid of them all in one day.Seems wishful to me though, given that we see thematically similar attacks on a weekly basis throughout the Muslim world. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯ reply lostlogin 19 hours agorootparent> Your airports have security because your leaders learned the same things on 9&#x2F;11 that the US did.This isn’t accurate. Where I live, no ID is required for domestic flights and I walk through a metal detector. That’s it. New Zealand.The rules I face going international are to keep other countries happy and my 101ml of water and potential bomb shoes are a bad joke.The attack on the US isn’t something I’ve see replicated in the Middle East weekly that I’ve ever noticed.If TSA rules make you feel safe, I suppose that’s good. Unfortunately they fail at their role 95% if the time.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;investigation-breaches-... reply ethanbond 18 hours agorootparentHuh somehow one of the closest US security allies, Five Eyes member NZ, isn’t subjugated by US security apparatus whims… almost like it has nothing to do with the US deciding other nations’ security regimes.Yes there are dozens of suicide attacks per year, and yes they are overwhelmingly throughout the Muslim world (not merely the Middle East).Security’s role is twofold: deterrence and prevention. You have no way of knowing what the deterrent effects are, which is why I asked if you’re of the belief that there were only 19 people willing to do what happened on 9&#x2F;11 and we just happened to get rid of them all on the same day.Do you believe that or not? reply lostlogin 18 hours agorootparentI appear to misinterpreted what you said. Your initial comment appeared to me to be a reference to flying a hijacked plane into a building and that isn’t happening that often. Suicide attacks in general are common. Never talked about in the same context is the lone angry man with a gun as that is somehow that is unsolvable in the US.Fascinating how the TSA overreach and ineffectiveness is somehow required, yet the terror inflicted by the domestic problem of gunmen is not able to be addressed. Is it not terrorism?Do you believe the TSA is effective? The Department of Homeland Security don’t. reply ethanbond 17 hours agorootparentWhat on earth are you on about? Is this just “USA has problems argh argh”?The reason the gun issue is hard to solve is extremely, extremely obvious. The early designers of our country wrote specific words on a particularly important document. Agree or disagree with those words or think they should be changed or whatever you want, the “why” of it being difficult to fix is self-evident to anyone who can read English though.Huh… DHS says TSA fails 95% of penetration tests.Let’s try two interpretations:1) DHS thinks TSA is “ineffective” (your interpretation) and yet continues to commit $9B+ per year to it for… no reason? Because they don’t have other programs to fund instead? To soothe the public while simultaneously publishing the 95% figure?2) DHS views TSA as one component of a risk-based “defense in depth” strategy and thinks its contributions to that overall system, despite failing most actual penetration tests, is worth $9B+ per year.You know if you got over the “USA stupid bad mean” the world would be a lot more interpretable. reply harrylove 18 hours agorootparentprev> Your airports have security because your leaders learned the same things on 9&#x2F;11 that the US did.I have to imagine that politics and power plays also contributed to these changes, as they did with the creation of Homeland Security, the apparent changes in surveillance, the uptick in militarization of police forces, the apparent changes in our attitudes toward incarceration, interrogation, and torture of suspected terrorists, and so on.When irrationality takes over, people want to feel safe more than they care about being safe. So, as a politician, if I want to achieve and maintain a high approval rating, I must attend to people&#x27;s beliefs more than I must attend to their needs.Thus, if other world leaders enact hardline policies and I am a leader in a country where my constituents are innumerate, illiterate, ignorant, or civically uninvolved, then following the lead of a strongman country is a shortcut to achieving my political ends. And in these cases, if other world leaders make these changes and I choose to do nothing, even if doing nothing is the right course of action, I should probably expect my approval rating to drop. reply ethanbond 17 hours agorootparent> Thus, if other world leaders enact hardline policies and I am a leader in a country where my constituents are innumerate, illiterate, ignorant, or civically uninvolved,And I suppose this is meant to describe pretty much every European and Asian country? replythenickdude 11 hours agoparentprevSounds reasonable to me. You don&#x27;t want people bringing fake weapons onboard that they can use to threaten people onboard with to comply with their demands, regardless of whether they could actually cause damage or not. reply gamblor956 19 hours agoparentprevWhat makes them a joke in this situation?They have pretty clearly outlined on their website, and in airports, for years that weapons--even toy versions of weapons--are not permitted in carry-on baggage.A lightsaber is not a real weapon, thus, the TSA allows lightsaber toys in carryons. (Note: this assumes the lightsaber is plastic. TSA agents are treated to assume metal rod-shaped objects as batons or similar, so metal lightsabers generally can&#x27;t be in carry-on.) reply goosinmouse 20 hours agoprevI had a buddy fly international out of the US just two weeks ago and TSA made him check his lightsaber and wouldnt let him carry it on.

You can come up with a weaponizeable design for almost any object you can think of e.g. a toy lightsaber with a heavy metal hilt the is basically usable as a club. You have to give agents the discretion to say \"yeah, that&#x27;s not coming on a plane\" reply sokoloff 20 hours agorootparentExactly. My mother-in-law is an avid golfer and had a temporary condition requiring the use of a cane. Friends of hers got her a driver (the largest golf club), modified to have a bent handle and some rubber on the head to serve as a cane.She was surprised to find that the TSA wouldn&#x27;t let her through security carrying what most would agree is effectively both a golf club (not allowed) and a cane (allowed). (I was surprised that she was surprised.) reply lostlogin 19 hours agorootparentThe surprising bit is that anyone would think there was room to swing a golf club.
