    "content": "AboutRoadmapPricingBlogCareersDocsSign inStart freeCreate an advanced search engine with PostgreSQLPostgreSQL provides the necessary building blocks for you to combine and create your own search engine for full-text search. Let's see how far we can take it.Written byTudor GolubencoPublished onJuly 12, 2023This is part 1 of a blog mini-series, in which we explore the full-text search functionality in PostgreSQL and investigate how much of the typical search engine functionality we can replicate. In part 2, we'll do a comparison between PostgreSQL's full-text search and Elasticsearch.If you want to follow along and try out the sample queries (which we recommend; it's more fun that way), the code samples are executed against the Wikipedia Movie Plots data set from Kaggle. To import it, download the CSV file, then create this table:CREATE TABLE movies( ReleaseYear int, Title text, Origin text, Director text, Casting text, Genre text, WikiPage text, Plot text);And import the CSV file like this:\\COPY movies(ReleaseYear, Title, Origin, Director, Casting, Genre, WikiPage, Plot) FROM 'wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;The dataset contains 34,000 movie titles and is about 81 MB in CSV format.PostgreSQL full-text search primitivesThe Postgres approach to full-text search offers building blocks that you can combine to create your own search engine. This is quite flexible but it also means it generally feels lower-level compared to search engines like Elasticsearch, Typesense, or Mellisearch, for which full-text search is the primary use case.The main building blocks, which we'll cover via examples, are:The tsvector and tsquery data typesThe match operator @@ to check if a tsquery matches a tsvectorFunctions to rank each match (ts_rank, ts_rank_cd)The GIN index type, an inverted index to efficiently query tsvectorWe'll start by looking at these building blocks and then we'll get into more advanced topics, covering relevancy boosters, typo-tolerance, and faceted search.tsvectorThe tsvector data type stores a sorted list of lexemes. A lexeme is a string, just like a token, but it has been normalized so that different forms of the same word are made. For example, normalization almost always includes folding upper-case letters to lower-case, and often involves removal of suffixes (such as s or ing in English). Here is an example, using the to_tsvector function to parse an English phrase into a tsvector.SELECT * FROM unnest(to_tsvector('english', 'I''m going to make him an offer he can''t refuse. Refusing is not an option.')); lexeme | positions | weights--------+-----------+--------- go   | {3}    | {D} m   | {2}    | {D} make  | {5}    | {D} offer | {8}    | {D} option | {17}   | {D} refus | {12,13}  | {D,D}(6 rows)As you can see, stop words like \u201cI\u201d, \u201cto\u201d or \u201can\u201d are removed, because they are too common to be useful for search. The words are normalized and reduced to their root (e.g. \u201crefuse\u201d and \u201cRefusing\u201d are both transformed into \u201crefus\u201d). The punctuation signs are ignored. For each word, the positions in the original phrase are recorded (e.g. \u201crefus\u201d is the 12th and the 13th word in the text) and the weights (which are useful for ranking and we'll discuss later).In the example above, the transformation rules from words to lexemes are based on the english search configuration. Running the same query with the simple search configuration results in a tsvector that includes all the words as they were found in the text:SELECT * FROM unnest(to_tsvector('simple', 'I''m going to make him an offer he can''t refuse. Refusing is not an option.'));  lexeme | positions | weights----------+-----------+--------- an    | {7,16}  | {D,D} can   | {10}   | {D} going  | {3}    | {D} he    | {9}    | {D} him   | {6}    | {D} i    | {1}    | {D} is    | {14}   | {D} m    | {2}    | {D} make   | {5}    | {D} not   | {15}   | {D} offer  | {8}    | {D} option  | {17}   | {D} refuse  | {12}   | {D} refusing | {13}   | {D} t    | {11}   | {D} to    | {4}    | {D}(16 rows)As you can see, \u201crefuse\u201d and \u201crefusing\u201d now result in different lexemes. The simple configuration is particularly useful when you have columns that contain labels or tags.PostgreSQL has built-in configurations for a pretty good set of languages. You can see the list by running:SELECT cfgname FROM pg_ts_config;Notably, however, there is no configuration for CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean), which is worth keeping in mind if you need to create a search query in those languages. While the simple configuration should work in practice quite well for unsupported languages, I'm not sure if that is enough for CJK.tsqueryThe tsquery data type is used to represent a normalized query. A tsquery contains search terms, which must be already-normalized lexemes, and may combine multiple terms using AND, OR, NOT, and FOLLOWED BY operators. There are functions like to_tsquery, plainto_tsquery, and websearch_to_tsquery that are helpful in converting user-written text into a proper tsquery, primarily by normalizing words appearing in the text.To get a feeling of tsquery, let's see a few examples using websearch_to_tsquery:SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'the darth vader'); websearch_to_tsquery----------------------'darth' & 'vader'That is a logical AND, meaning that the document needs to contain both \"darth\" and \"vader\" in order to match. You can do logical OR as well:SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'darth OR vader'); websearch_to_tsquery---------------------- 'darth' | 'vader'And you can exclude words:SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'darth vader -wars');  websearch_to_tsquery--------------------------- 'darth' & 'vader' & !'war'Also, you can represent phrase searches:SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('english', '\"the darth vader son\"');   websearch_to_tsquery------------------------------ 'darth' <-> 'vader' <-> 'son'This means: \u201cdarth\u201d, followed by \u201cvader\u201d, followed by \u201cson\u201d.Note, however, that the \u201cthe\u201d word is ignored, because it's a stop word as per the english search configuration. This can be an issue on phrases like this:SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('english', '\"do or do not, there is no try\"'); websearch_to_tsquery---------------------- 'tri'(1 row)Oops, almost the entire phrase was lost. Using the simple config gives the expected result:SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('simple', '\"do or do not, there is no try\"');              websearch_to_tsquery-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 'do' <-> 'or' <-> 'do' <-> 'not' <-> 'there' <-> 'is' <-> 'no' <-> 'try'You can check whether a tsquery matches a tsvector by using the match operator @@.SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'darth vader') @@ to_tsvector('english', 'Darth Vader is my father.'); ?column?---------- tWhile the following example doesn't match:SELECT websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'darth vader -father') @@ to_tsvector('english', 'Darth Vader is my father.'); ?column?---------- fGINNow that we've seen tsvector and tsquery at work, let's look at another key building block: the GIN index type is what makes it fast. GIN stands for Generalized Inverted Index. GIN is designed for handling cases where the items to be indexed are composite values, and the queries to be handled by the index need to search for element values that appear within the composite items. This means that GIN can be used for more than just text search, notably for JSON querying.You can create a GIN index on a set of columns, or you can first create a column of type tsvector, to include all the searchable columns. Something like this:ALTER TABLE movies ADD search tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', Title) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('english', Plot) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('simple', Director) || ' ' || to_tsvector('simple', Genre) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('simple', Origin) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('simple', Casting)) STORED;And then create the actual index:CREATE INDEX idx_search ON movies USING GIN(search);You can now perform a simple test search like this:SELECT title FROM movies WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','darth vader');             title-------------------------------------------------- Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars) Return of the Jedi Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith(3 rows)To see the effects of the index, you can compare the timings of the above query with and without the index. The GIN index takes it from over 200 ms to about 4 ms on my computer.ts_rankSo far, we've seen how ts_vector and ts_query can match search queries. However, for a good search experience, it is important to show the best results first - meaning that the results need to be sorted by relevancy.Taking it directly from the docs:PostgreSQL provides two predefined ranking functions, which take into account lexical, proximity, and structural information; that is, they consider how often the query terms appear in the document, how close together the terms are in the document, and how important is the part of the document where they occur. However, the concept of relevancy is vague and very application-specific. Different applications might require additional information for ranking, e.g., document modification time. The built-in ranking functions are only examples. You can write your own ranking functions and/or combine their results with additional factors to fit your specific needs.The two ranking functions mentioned are ts_rank and ts_rank_cd. The difference between them is that while they both take into account the frequency of the term, ts_rank_cd also takes into account the proximity of matching lexemes to each other.To use them in a query, you can do something like this:SELECT title,    ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'darth vader')) rank FROM movies WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','darth vader') ORDER BY rank DESC LIMIT 10;            title            |  rank--------------------------------------------------+------------- The Empire Strikes Back             | 0.26263964 Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars) | 0.18902963 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith   | 0.10292397 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (film)       | 0.10049681 Return of the Jedi                | 0.09910346 American Honey                  | 0.09910322One thing to note about ts_rank is that it needs to access the search column for each result. This means that if the WHERE condition matches a lot of rows, PostgreSQL needs to visit them all in order to do the ranking, and that can be slow. To exemplify, the above query returns in 5-7 ms on my computer. If I modify the query to do search for darth OR vader, it returns in about 80 ms, because there are now over 1000 matching result that need ranking and sorting.Relevancy tuningWhile relevancy based on word frequency is a good default for the search sorting, quite often the data contains important indicators that are more relevant than simply the frequency.Here are some examples for a movies dataset:Matches in the title should be given higher importance than matches in the description or plot.More popular movies can be promoted based on ratings and/or the number of votes they receive.Certain categories can be boosted more, considering user preferences. For instance, if a particular user enjoys comedies, those movies can be given a higher priority.When ranking search results, newer titles can be considered more relevant than very old titles.This is why dedicated search engines typically offer ways to use different columns or fields to influence the ranking. Here are example tuning guides from Elastic, Typesense, and Meilisearch.If you want a visual demo of the impact of relevancy tuning, here is a quick 4 minutes video about it:Numeric, date, and exact value boostersWhile Postgres doesn't have direct support for boosting based on other columns, the rank is ultimately just a sort expression, so you can add your own signals to it.For example, if you want to add a boost for the number of votes, you can do something like this:SELECT title, ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'jedi'))  -- numeric booster example  + log(NumberOfVotes)*0.01 FROM movies WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','jedi') ORDER BY rank DESC LIMIT 10;The logarithm is there to smoothen the impact, and the 0.01 factor brings the booster to a comparable scale with the ranking score.You can also design more complex boosters, for example, boost by the rating, but only if the ranking has a certain number of votes. To do this, you can create a function like this:create function numericBooster(rating numeric, votes numeric, voteThreshold numeric) returns numeric as $$ select case when votes < voteThreshold then 0 else rating end;$$ language sql;And use it like this:SELECT title, ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'jedi'))  -- numeric booster example  + numericBooster(Rating, NumberOfVotes, 100)*0.005 FROM movies WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','jedi') ORDER BY rank DESC LIMIT 10;Let's take another example. Say we want to boost the ranking of comedies. You can create a valueBooster function that looks like this:create function valueBooster (col text, val text, factor integer) returns integer as $$ select case when col = val then factor else 0 end;$$ language sql;The function returns a factor if the column matches a particular value and 0 instead. Use it in a query like this:SELECT title, genre,  ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'jedi'))  -- value booster example  + valueBooster(Genre, 'comedy', 0.05) rankFROM movies  WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','jedi')                                                 ORDER BY rank DESC LIMIT 10;           title            |        genre        |    rank--------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------- The Men Who Stare at Goats            | comedy               | 0.1107927106320858 Clerks                      | comedy               | 0.1107927106320858 Star Wars: The Clone Wars            | animation             | 0.09513916820287704 Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace 3D   | sci-fi               | 0.09471701085567474 Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace    | space opera            | 0.09471701085567474 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones   | science fiction          | 0.09285612404346466 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith   | science fiction, action      | 0.09285612404346466 Star Wars: The Last Jedi             | action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi | 0.0889768898487091 Return of the Jedi                | science fiction          | 0.07599088549613953 Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars) | science fiction          | 0.07599088549613953(10 rows)Column weightsRemember when we talked about the tsvector lexemes and that they can have weights attached? Postgres supports 4 weights, named A, B, C, and D. A is the biggest weight while D is the lowest and the default. You can control the weights via the setweight function which you would typically call when building the tsvector column:ALTER TABLE movies ADD search tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS  (setweight(to_tsvector('english', Title), 'A') || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('english', Plot) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('simple', Director) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('simple', Genre) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('simple', Origin) || ' ' ||  to_tsvector('simple', Casting)) STORED;Let's see the effects of this. Without setweight, a search for jedi returns:SELECT title, ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'jedi')) rank  FROM movies  WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','jedi')  ORDER BY rank DESC;           title            |  rank--------------------------------------------------+------------- Star Wars: The Clone Wars            | 0.09513917 Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace    | 0.09471701 Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace 3D   | 0.09471701 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith   | 0.092856124 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones   | 0.092856124 Star Wars: The Last Jedi             | 0.08897689 Return of the Jedi                | 0.075990885 Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars) | 0.075990885 Clerks                      | 0.06079271 The Empire Strikes Back             | 0.06079271 The Men Who Stare at Goats            | 0.06079271 How to Deal                   | 0.06079271(12 rows)And with the setweight on the title column:SELECT title, ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'jedi')) rank  FROM movies  WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','jedi')  ORDER BY rank DESC;           title            |  rank--------------------------------------------------+------------- Star Wars: The Last Jedi             |  0.6361112 Return of the Jedi                |  0.6231253 Star Wars: The Clone Wars            | 0.09513917 Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace    | 0.09471701 Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace 3D   | 0.09471701 Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith   | 0.092856124 Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones   | 0.092856124 Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars) | 0.075990885 The Empire Strikes Back             | 0.06079271 Clerks                      | 0.06079271 The Men Who Stare at Goats            | 0.06079271 How to Deal                   | 0.06079271(12 rows)Note how the movie titles with \u201cjedi\u201d in their name have jumped to the top of the list, and their rank has increased.It's worth pointing out that having only four weight \u201cclasses\u201d is somewhat limiting, and that they need to be applied when computing the tsvector.Typo-tolerance / fuzzy searchPostgreSQL doesn't support fuzzy search or typo-tolerance directly, when using tsvector and tsquery. However, working on the assumptions that the typo is in the query part, we can implement the following idea:index all lexemes from the content in a separate tablefor each word in the query, use similarity or Levenshtein distance to search in this tablemodify the query to include any words that are foundperform the searchHere is how it works. First, use ts_stats to get all words in a materialized view:CREATE MATERLIAZED VIEW unique_lexeme AS  SELECT word FROM ts_stat('SELECT search FROM movies');Now, for each word in the query, check if it is in the unique_lexeme view. If it's not, do a fuzzy-search in that view to find possible misspellings of it:SELECT * FROM unique_lexeme  WHERE levenshtein_less_equal(word, 'pregant', 2) < 2;  word---------- premant pregrant pregnant paegantIn the above we use the Levenshtein distance because that's what search engines like Elasticsearch use for fuzzy search.Once you have the candidate list of words, you need to adjust the query include them all.Faceted searchFaceted search is popular especially on e-commerce sites because it helps customers to iteratively narrow their search. Here is an example from amazon.com:Faceted search on AmazonThe above can implemented by manually defining categories and then adding them as WHERE conditions to the search. Another approach is to create the categories algorithmically based on the existing data. For example, you can use the following to create a \u201cDecade\u201d facet:SELECT ReleaseYear/10*10 decade, count(Title) cnt FROM movies WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','star wars') GROUP BY decade ORDER BY cnt DESC; decade | cnt--------+-----  2000 | 39  2010 | 31  1990 | 29  1950 | 28  1940 | 26  1980 | 22  1930 | 13  1960 | 11  1970 |  7  1910 |  3  1920 |  3(11 rows)This also provides counts of matches for each decade, which you can display in brackets.If you want to get multiple facets in a single query, you can combine them, for example, by using CTEs:WITH releaseYearFacets AS ( SELECT 'Decade' facet, (ReleaseYear/10*10)::text val, count(Title) cnt FROM movies WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','star wars') GROUP BY val ORDER BY cnt DESC),genreFacets AS ( SELECT 'Genre' facet, Genre val, count(Title) cnt FROM movies WHERE search @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english','star wars') GROUP BY val ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 5)SELECT * FROM releaseYearFacets UNION SELECT * FROM genreFacets; facet |  val  | cnt--------+---------+----- Decade | 1910  |  3 Decade | 1920  |  3 Decade | 1930  | 13 Decade | 1940  | 26 Decade | 1950  | 28 Decade | 1960  | 11 Decade | 1970  |  7 Decade | 1980  | 22 Decade | 1990  | 29 Decade | 2000  | 39 Decade | 2010  | 31 Genre | comedy | 21 Genre | drama  | 35 Genre | musical |  9 Genre | unknown | 13 Genre | war   | 15(16 rows)The above should work quite well on small to medium data sets, however it can become slow on very large data sets.ConclusionWe've seen the PostgreSQL full-text search primitives, and how we can combine them to create a pretty advanced full-text search engine, which also happens to support things like joins and ACID transactions. In other words, it has functionality that the other search engines typically don't have.There are more advanced search topics that would be worth covering in detail:suggesters / auto-completeexact phrase matchinghybrid search (semantic + keyword) by combining with pg-vectorEach of these would be worth their own blog post (coming!), but by now you should have an intuitive feeling about them: they are quite possible using PostgreSQL, but they require you to do the work of combining the primitives and in some cases the performance might suffer on very large datasets.In part 2, we'll make a detailed comparison with Elasticsearch, looking to answer the question on when is it worth it to implement search into PostgreSQL versus adding Elasticsearch to your infrastructure and syncing the data.

Although ElasticSearch (nowadays: OpenSearch) is available, we never deemed it important enough for this part of the product.In case you care, my comment from a few years: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27977526replyjsdwarf 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Looking forward for part 2 / postgres vs elasticsearch. One application at my company uses PG for CRUD on objects and elastic for searching them. We completely underestimated the effort of keeping the two datastores in sync and are actually contemplating to get rid of elasticsearch.replyplasma 8 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]A technique I've used before is to treat Elasticsearch as rebuildable at any time, consider this approach:A cron runs every 5 minutes that looks at your database for any objects you're indexing where last_modified_at timestamp > last_indexing_started_timestamp.Index the objects into Elasticsearch, then update the last_indexing_started_timestamp value to be when you started the original sync process, so we catch any modified objects between the start/end of the update run, next run.Then if Elasticsearch needs rebuilding you can just clear out the last indexing timestamp and resync from the start of time, and its self-recovering / won't get out of sync.replyxps 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Tried this as well but the difficulty is that Postgres is a relational database whereas ElasticSearch stores schema-less documents.Your record in ES might include data from many different tables, and figuring out what to (efficiently) update when there is a change in Postgres is not a simple task.replyJustsignedup 54 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]For me, a shotgun approach seemed the least likely to break.Anything that is a dependency in the elastisearch index should trigger a job to export to it. And since it is idempotent it doesn't matter if it accidentally exports two or ten times the same index in a bg job. Just make sure before writing that you do a quick check that you're not overriding a fresher one. So just have a freshness timestamp which is the latest timestamp of any record used in the indexing data.Furthermore you can do a daily job to just re export a critical part of the index. Doesn't matter if it is or isn't fresh. So let's say you query all records that were modified in the last day, and trigger the export job thatnmaynincludebthat record. Even if it causes duicate work. Idempotency saves you there.replydgb23 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This issue comes up in several domains and tech layers (back to front, bottom up etc.)Are there any generic, algorithmic or even just heuristics that help with this?It\u2019s something I\u2018ve been thinking about over some time now.

Whenever an update happens to an entity in PG we send a message to async replicate that entity in ES (via ID lookup in PG). As always you need good monitoring and retries for async computation but ES is quite stable and fast so we rarely had any issues.Now, we had pretty lax consistency requirements, as long as the \"latest state\" of PG ended up in ES within a reasonable timeframe everything was fine so maybe your requirements are different.replyhn_throwaway_99 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah, I think more folks should learn about postgres LISTEN and NOTIFY functionality, https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html, it's great for stuff like this, and there are now various client libraries like pg-listen in NPM that make this really easy to use.This is especially useful if you have lots of different teams/code paths that may update your DB - just set up a trigger that causes a NOTIFY message to get sent, then have a client responsible for reading for PG and populating ES. Alternatively, if you can accept a bit more latency, just have a trigger that sets a \"needsESIndexing\" dirty column somewhere and have a polling process that picks rows WHERE needsESIndexing = TRUE and just updates this to FALSE when the indexing is complete.replymacNchz 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It has been several years since I worked on a system that implemented listen/notify, but I recall there was a significant caveat that if the listener was unavailable at the exact moment the NOTIFY executes, the message would be lost.That\u2019s a significant risk for things that need to be in sync between two systems, so we stuck with listen/notify for info-level ops things and used polling/queue systems that offered better guarantees for more important tasks. Don\u2019t want to be in a position where a quiet hiccup with a deploy or something results in fun bugs like 0.5% of rows being silently out of sync between ES and Postgres.replyxupybd 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You could put a Nats JetStream connection in line and you'd have a good buffer to catch the notifications.

Worked out great, although the \"simple\" interface to it was a bit too simple and I ended up having to build up a DSL to translate searches into the more complex interface to the fulltext index.And any modifications to any field that was indexed, or having to update how things were indexed, was a chore thanks to referential integrity enforcement at the DB level: I had to remove and afterwards reapply things like foreign key constraints, triggers, stored procs, etc.... for both the \"up\" AND the \"down\"!

I was primarily interested how much of the functionality I can replicate. Because for small search use cases this has some clear advantages: less infra to maintain, strong consistency, joins, etc.Also, at Xata we're thinking about having a smooth transition between using Postgres at small scale, then migrating to use Elasticsearch with minimal breaking changes.replybshipp 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Using measured comparisons and making informed choices is certainly the best way.If you can start with Postgres to have a relational database with the benefit of Full Text Search (i.e. avoid Elastisearch) as well as JSON fields (i.e. avoid MongoDB) then you end up simplifying initial hardware/software requirements while retaining the ability to migrate to those solutions when user demand requires it.So many developers seem to build with the idea that they'll become the next FAANG when actual (or reasonably forecasted) user load doesn't remotely require such a complex software stack.replyvlovich123 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think you\u2019re being ungenerous in the reasoning. The initial setup to get something running is similar while a specific technology may scale better. From that perspective, you may be better off picking ES to avoid paying back technical debt if you do need to grow. Early strategic investments help - sure, you won\u2019t get everything right, but getting enough things right can be the difference between the sales channel being bottlenecks on deal flow vs on engineering. The former can be a lot faster to resolve than the latter.replysebmellen 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]No failed company ever failed because of a lack of technical complexity, nor have successful companies been held back by not adopting complex architectures early.> \"It is hard for less experienced developers to appreciate how rarely architecting for future requirements / applications turns out net-positive.\"\u2014 John Carmackhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_itreplylyu07282 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think picking lucene/es for search is hardly \"architecting for future requirements\" if your task is to build search functionality.

Evaluating needs from a \"potential risks\" standpoint is a lot harder, and easy to do wrong; the true risk is not growing at all, so the heuristic for any new project should be to do the simplest possible thing that solves the problem and starts the scaling process (i.e. whatever produces a saleable product).The other benefit to starting with uncomplicated architecture is that you leave yourself with more scaling vectors, so once you deeply understand the problem(s) you actually need to solve, you can pick the right tool.For us, Postgres FTS covered 95% of our use-cases. If we had started by just using ElasticSearch, we would have had a lot more complexity to maintain, and we would never have discovered our current (surprisingly elegant) architecture.replySpivak 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You're talking about application complexity when the parent is talking about operational complexity. The difference between some app servers talking to a Postgres instance with a replica and that plus an ES cluster is jump. If you're paying for something managed then it probably doesn't matter much to you. In my experience it's actually quite rare that teams working on a product where search is a feature and not the product itself ever graduate from what Postgres offers so I tend to push back on ES when it isn't free.replypaulryanrogers 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You may be able to hedge your bets by separating the Postures search DB from the OLTP. Perhaps it could use FDW or similar to make them appear the same from the app layer.Then if FTS won't scale to unpredictable future needs it should be easier to rip out and replace with ES or anything else.

Goal was to take a huge Postgres database and make it searchable and usable.It ended up that doing a offline batch job to boil down the much bigger dataset into a single pre-optimized table was the best approach for us.

Ideally, you'd like to reserve CPU in your database for transactional updates to your core data model.I've seen a lot of ES and Solr clusters operating at 100% of 10+ nodes during a re-index, or just 30-50% of 10+ nodes during normal operation. The corresponding database would be say an AWS L/XL instance at 50-100GB of data and 30% CPU utilization. Moving all of the search CPU into your primary DB means now you'd have to shard it.But I love PG extensions for search, recursive joins, vectors, etc on side projects.

The first one evolved into a full region-based borrowing system. The second one became generational references. Together, they looked like they could form an entirely new approach to memory safety, one that doesn't use reference counting, tracing garbage collection, nor borrow checking.Basically, the coder writes their program in a normal C or C++ish way, and Vale's generational references keep everything memory safe. Then, the coder can use pure and region borrowing to eliminate most generation check overhead. 1 Add in some linear style, 2 and we can get generation checks down to zero for any Vale code.In other words, this could make our Vale code very, very fast.The exciting part is that region borrowing is completely opt-in. We could write our code in a normal, comfortable way, and later add region borrowing for the parts that we want to optimize, almost like a more flexible, opt-in borrow checker. 3 We could choose which parts of our program should be as flexible as Java, or as fast as Rust, or anywhere in-between.But alas, it was all a theory. We couldn't play with it, because it wasn't real yet!Vale's First Prototype for Immutable Region BorrowingBuilding the TheoryThe BenchmarksWhat does this mean?Where does Vale go from here?ConclusionWe're looking for sponsors!Side Notes(interesting tangential thoughts)0See the original article here, but keep in mind that was written before I came up with generational references!1A \"generation check\" happens whenever we dereference a generational reference. It checks to make sure the target object is still alive.2Linear style is where we never make a reference to something unless handing it into a pure function.3This is possible because it makes borrowing compose much better with shared mutability; you can do as much aliasing as you want and then turn the entire world immutable via pure.Building the TheoryMost of my free time for the past few years has gone into building out the compiler's foundations so that it could support this unexplored approach.It was hard. Any kind of borrowing system is already pretty complex, but they also require full generics, which are notoriously difficult. 4 5On top of that, an entire new compiler stage was needed to get regions and generational references to work seamlessly together. 6Finally, a few months ago, the regions prototype was finished. It's rough around the edges, 7 but it successfully compiled something for the first time.With that, I made the first ever zero-check Vale program! 8It was a program that uses Cellular Automata to generate a level for a roguelike game.0Of course, it didn't work perfectly at first. Compilers are tricky. The slightest misstep in the compiler code will add extra instructions to the resulting assembly, causing artificial overhead in the final program. And sometimes, there's extra little bits of information you need to pass to the optimizer (or the CPU itself!) to trick it into the most optimal behavior.To help me track down the problems, I kept comparing its assembly to the assembly generated by Vale's \"unsafe\" modes:unsafe_no_bounds is similar to C; all memory-safety protections are turned off, and it only uses raw pointers for everything, rather than generational references.unsafe_with_bounds then adds bounds checking for array accesses, similar to how Rust does it.After a couple months of tracking down differences, the resulting assembly looked nearly identical to Vale's unsafe_with_bounds mode! Every difference was expected 9 and everything looked pretty reasonable.4Previously, Vale had templates (like C++), not full generics.5It took the Golang team a decade to figure out their generics, and I don't blame them at all for that, after this struggle with generics!6Under the hood, it reduces regions to \"pure height\" integers: negative for region generic parameters, zero for the default region, and increasing positive for every pure block.7For example, its compile errors are very, very verbose, and there are a lot of things that just trigger assertions in the compiler still. I'll be fixing all of these before merging it into the main branch.8You can count how many generation checks in a program via the --print_mem_overhead true compiler flag.9The only expected difference is that it put a pseudo-random generation number at the top of every allocation, though it never needed to read it for any generation checks. This is really just a monotonically increasing register under the hood, to keep things fast. We'll be able to remove this once we add isolates or unique references.The BenchmarksFinally, I benchmarked the program again:Summary './build_unsafe_no_bounds/main' ran  1.18 \u00b1 0.01 times faster than './build_unsafe_with_bounds/main'  1.18 \u00b1 0.01 times faster than './build_safe_fastest/main'Success! Vale's normal mode (safe_fastest here) showed no slowdowns compared to only bounds checking.In other words, this approach has no observable overhead. 10Finally seeing this was a shock, a relief, and almost surreal. No overhead! We knew it was possible in theory, but seeing it happen for real still felt very surprising.Feel free to play with it! Just build from the regions branch, check out the benchmarking scripts, and ask any questions in the discord server.And before we get too excited, let's keep these important details in mind:This is not benchmarking against languages like C and Rust directly. Those compilers have years of unrelated optimizations that would just confound the experiment, so I compare with unsafe_no_bounds and unsafe_with_bounds to isolate those variables and get a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.This was benchmarked on a Razer Blade 15\" 2018 (512GB SSD) running Ubuntu 22.04, using hyperfine inside a cset shield.When I made larger programs, I observed quite a bit of optimizer noise, 11 where a minor change in one area would swing the measurements one way or another. 12 Benchmark results for the larger programs seemed rather fragile. We'll need a large set of benchmark programs to isolate away this optimizer noise.In a larger program (a tiny roguelike game), I also observed that the optimizer didn't merge two identical branches of an if-statement, and missed a couple other obvious optimizations. I'm not sure how the presence of an integer (especially unread!) would affect this. It could even be a bug in LLVM, which are pretty common.That last one hints that we might want our own Vale-specific pre-optimizer, similar to Rust's MIR, 13 since LLVM was designed more with C in mind. 14Still, even with these details, these results are quite promising!10There could be overhead in theory, in the form of a nonatomic monotonically incrementing integer used for filling generations. It doesn't seem to affect the performance, likely because registers and simple arithmetic operations are so cheap on modern CPUs compared to the real bottleneck which is memory latency. The optimizer also often optimizes it out, since it sees nobody using these generations.11This is not the same thing as benchmark noise. This benchmarking setup reported very consistent run times (hence the \u00b1 0.01 in the output).12In fact, when I switched the size of the generation numbers, it consistently had negative overhead (1.13 \u00b1 0.01), which is a bit weird considering that there weren't that many generation numbers in the program anyway. It did change the register allocations, so I suspect that's dwarfing any performance differences from anything actually semantically different in the programs.13Thanks bluejekyll for this correction!14We might want this anyway, as I'm pretty sure LLVM would treat generational references as undefined behavior, if it could figure out that we're intentionally accessing released memory.What does this mean?This means that generational references and regions combine to form a memory safety approach that is very, very fast.It also means that this approach is actually viable, and could be desirable for quite a few software domains. A domain might desire this approach if:It wants more predictable latency than tracing garbage collection.It wants better performance and cache friendliness than reference counting.It wants to prototype and iterate more easily than with borrow checking.Where does Vale go from here?The above benchmarks compared Vale's safe mode to Vale's unsafe modes, for a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.However, there are still a few things to do before Vale can really go toe-to-toe with languages like C and C++. 15I'll need to start a Vale-specific pre-optimizer, since LLVM's optimizer seems to have some problems reasoning about generations and immutability.Vale still needs to support inline data, instead of putting all structs on the heap. (Note that that wouldn't affect the above benchmarks, which didn't use any structs.)Regions are still just in the prototype phase. I'll need to smoothe out the rough edges, pay down a bit of tech debt, and merge this code in before doing anything else.After this is merged in, I'll be making the standard library use regions so that every user will benefit from them, even if their main program code doesn't use regions directly.It's a pretty ambitious endeavor, so it's not clear how long this will take.

It literally writes so: \"(panic)\". I want to point out that \"panic\" is a very strong word and should be avoided in scenarios where a normal error handling takes place. Any kind of panic is always a sign of an uncontrolled situation, and if a program ever \"panics\" it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.The next struggle was to get the basic help for the command-line parameters. But it's currently non-existent.The next and final stuggle: trying a hello world sample. I copied the code from the website: import stdlib.*; exported func main() {  println(\"Hello world!\"); }and saved it to 'hello.vl' file. Then, I tried to build it: > valec hello.vlHowever, no luck for me this time:  Unknown subcommand, specify `build`, `run`, etc. Use `help` for more. It looks like I should specify 'build' command. Let's try: > valec build hello.vlWell, here is the result: Unrecognized input: hello.vl                                                     (panic) Hm.

Exhausting the counter would be the least of your worries.Practically speaking you could never allocate memory that fast, a memory allocation is going to be well over 1000ns on average.Then there's the little matter of address space. Pointers on x64 are limited to 47 bits, meaning that if even you had a magical memory allocator with no book-keeping overhead, and all your allocations were 1 byte, you'd run out of pointers first.

One counter is only ever going to be touched by a single core at a time.And even if there was a single counter, multithreading cannot make incrementing a counter faster.

Part of the issues with reference counting is that they are shared, meaning that it needs to be atomically incremented and decremented whenever you make a new reference (for instance in C++ if you return a shared_ptr or similar). Generational references though instead track something as a part of the value you pass around, meaning that it has better locality and doesn't suffer from contention.Copying references is assumed to be more frequent than allocating and freeing, so this is a win.replyflohofwoe 23 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Typically that slot is disabled on overflow, so that no more objects can be created at that slot / memory location, which avoids the handle collision. The slot could be recycled at specific points in the code when it is certain that no more handles for this slot are out in the wild (not sure if Vale does that)(Or possibly the whole region could be discarded once it was running full, and the physical memory recycled at a new virtial address. There's plenty of virtual address space to burn through when not limited to 32 bits)replypxeger1 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Reference counting involves an increment every time a reference is shared. That's a lot more overhead than just on alloc and free - in particular, it involves going to main memory (or using part of the cache) a lot more in order to change the ref counts. Whereas on alloc and free, those frames have to fetched anyway (at least in my understanding of how memory allocators work)replyklabb3 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Ref counts have cycles, which cause leaks (in this universe).But I digress.

Thus, the program can still fail on a memory access when the expected and actual generations don't match? In this regard, this seems less \"safe\" than reference counting, tracing garbage collector, or borrow checking?replyflohofwoe 23 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]It's safe the same way a segfault is safe instead of just allowing to read or write random memory through a dangling pointer, but generational indices should also allow to check at runtime if an access would be valid before actually attempting the access. Not sure if that's possible in Vale though.replyverdagon 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Double-frees are prevented by Vale's single ownership (in the C++ sense), generational references make it so use-after-frees are safely detected. If we try to access released memory via a reference, we should predictably+safely get either a segmentation fault or an assertion failure (and a future improvement involving remapping virtual space will make it so we get no segmentation faults, which I'm pretty excited for). Hope that helps!replyflohofwoe 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Double-frees are prevented by Vale's single ownership (in the C++ sense)...wouldn't that also be prevented by the generation-check even if there is no single-ownership? Because once the referenced item is destroyed (and thus bumping that \"memory slot's\" generation counter) that item reference becomes invalid because the generation no longer matches, so the next attempt to release the item with that same reference should also fail?One nice property of generational-indices is that they can be shared without compromising memory safety. As soon as the item is destroyed, all shared references in the wild automatically become invalid.

So basically, the reference needs to access the allocation to check if it can access the allocation. Right.(That doesn't work of course, because if the allocation was freed, access to the allocation and so its generation number is undefined).This seems obvious so maybe I am missing something big here?Or something entirely different is meant or targeted here with \"memory safety\".replyjsnell 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think the part where your reasoning is invalid is this part:> so its generation number is undefinedWith e.g. a random C compiler and a random malloc, that's true. But why couldn't the language and runtime cooperate to ensure it is defined?For example deallocation can write a predictable value to that slot, which is never used as a legit generation index. The memory allocator can make sure that a memory address that ever contained a generation can never contain anything else than generation ids for the entire runtime of the program (e.g. by ensuring that for a given page, all objects are the same size and the allocations are aligned to that size). The language can make sure that nothing else can get written to such a memory address by enforcing bounds checks.replyverdagon 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yep, this is the correct answer. Accessing released memory is undefined in C, but well-defined in Vale. The goal is to ensure that the user predictably+safely gets either a segmentation fault or an assertion failure.We have a future improvement planned here too: for unrelated reasons (to support generation pre-checking) the random generational references implementation will soon not even unmap any virtual address space, instead remapping it to a central page, so we won't even get any segmentation faults, just assertion failures.replyajb 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Ok but then aren't you going to get memory fragmentation? If you allocate and then deallocate a billion 1kB objects, you can't then coalesce them to allocate larger units because the generation number locations before each 1kB can't be given back to user code.replyverdagon 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]In the basic generational references approach that was a drawback, and the reason it couldn't release memory back to the OS. We planned to use something like MESH [0] to reduce the fragmentation.We created two newer approaches since then, which let any memory be reused for any purpose:* Random generational references, where it's fine if generations overlap with other data.* Side-table generations, which is slower but we keep the generations in a side-table. It's can be seen in old 0.1 versions as the \"resilient-v2\" mode, and I plan on resurrecting it for unrelated reasons.The former will be the default, and the latter we'll be adding back in as an option. Hope that helps![0] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04738.pdfreplyflohofwoe 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Traditional memory allocators set aside some of the memory for metadata (for instance to keep track of allocated and free memory regions), I guess that Vale stores the generation count associated with an \"allocation item\" in a similar way, e.g. somewhere else than the actual items.Also, the blog post talks about 'generational indices', not pointers. This seems to indicate that items of the same type (or at least same size) are grouped into arrays (and since it's an index anyway, the metadata could be stored in one or multiple separate arrays at the same index).PS: I already linked it elsewhere, but here's how the same can be achieved without language/compiler support (at least it's the same general idea): https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.htmlThe big step forward by Vale is that the compiler can elide most of the 'dangling checks' on memory accesses, the method outlined in the blog post requires a few rules-of-thumb the coder must follow when using a pointer that's been looked up from a generational-index.replyconaclos 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If I am not wrong, there is a generation number embedded in the reference (smart pointer?). This allows to check if the generation of the reference and the generation of the referee match.replymarhee 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, there is a generation number in the reference. It is checked against the generation number of the allocation that is stored in the allocation: void __check(GenerationalReference genRef) {  uint64_t currentGeneration = *(uint64_t*)((char*)genRef.alloc - 8);  assert(genRef.rememberedGeneration == currentGeneration); }So indeed you it allows you to check for a match, as long as the alloc pointer is valid. The alloc pointer is invalid after a free, because it maybe be in a region no longer accessible to the program (it was returned to the os by free's implementation) or it was given out as part of an other allocation, in which case it can hold arbitrary data.replykreco 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Is it less \"safe\" than your own restricted definition then... maybe?replyjupp0r 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]The approach of having options to optimize hot code paths with zero cost abstractions while still not having to worry about memory management in the vast majority of the rest of your code sounds like the best of both worlds to me (given that we only trade performance, not safety for convenience).replymgaunard 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]I write C++ exclusively and never worry about memory management.I don't use smart pointers since shared ownership is a bad concept.The problem of memory management is largely trivial.replywillvarfar 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The problem of memory management is largely trivial _if_ you are in a small clean opinionated private codebase without cruft, collaborators, third party code, ...? :)Google et al have been working on sanitisers etc because, even in well kept codebases with strict coding standards that are rigorously applied in reviews, memory bugs do actually creep in.replyjupp0r 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Memory management is trivial if your problem is trivial.

Everything happens under control of the system.replyjlouis 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If you witness the amount of effort/work/man-hours that is being poured into making memory management easier, I'd say it is far from a trivial problem.If you witness the endless amount of bugs, many security related, which stems from the idea that people can handle memory, I'd say it is far from a trivial problem.If you witness any modern language, a common design principle is to eliminate memory management.

I'd suspect that many microcontroller programs might have to be really careful about using the heap just because they just don't have the memory to allocate that much. https://www.perforce.com/blog/kw/NASA-rules-for-developing-s...replyrcxdude 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It's pretty easy in a lot of embedded applications to basically only have objects that live forever or are allocated on the stack. I usually aim for zero heap at all, and just have statically allocated objects for the 'forever' set (which makes it easier to see what's using memory). If you're careful you can also statically work out worst-case stack usage as well and have a decent guarantee that you won't ever run out of memory. If there are short-lived objects, a memory pool or queue is usually the best option (though at that point you do invite use-after-free type errors and pool exhaustion). I would say with this style it's extremely rare to have memory safety issues, but it's also not really suitable to a lot of applications.replyLk7Of3vfJS2n 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Why is it not really suitable to a lot of applications?replyJonChesterfield 23 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]C++ uses value type to mean either a scalar object (int, tuple<double> etc) or a container that manages heap memory for you, e.g. a vector of a value type.

You can replace every use of std::unique_ptr with std::vector and just switch a few method calls (like using .data() instead of .get()) and you'd achieve the same effects, just slower. I'm not sure what the point would be though, other than to be able to claim that you don't use smart pointers.replyspacechild1 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]But std::shared_ptr is also a value type :)replymgaunard 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It isn't.

Hoe / wie kunnen we contacteren om dit in #Belgi\u00eb ook voor elkaar te krijgen?0Alexandra van Huffelen@avhuffelen@social.overheid.nlVandaag lanceren wij onze overheidsserver op Mastodon.In de brief die ik aan de Kamer heb gestuurd over 'Digitale gemeenschapsgoederen' op 22 juni, heb ik aangegeven dat ik twee waardengedreven alternatieven voor social media ondersteun. Een van deze alternatieven is een 'eigen' Mastodon-server die door overheidsorganisaties gebruikt worden.

Well maybe not the EU, as the Union itself actually has a server instance for both its organisations and it\u2019s elected officials, but the member countries. Like my own. All our politicians are on social media, but they are all on three platforms, two which are owned by two American billionaires and one which is owned by the Chinese government. All three platforms has massive privacy and democracy issues in terms of how they operate, and none of the content on them are owned by their users. Now I\u2019m all for the EU using regulation to eventually reform something like meta into being a decent enough centralised platform. But why on earth would our institutions be on something they don\u2019t control?With ActivityPub and Mastodon our government could run a server for all our elected officials and then it would be our country that governed what they could and could not post on there. Now, I\u2019m not a political radical, but I do think it\u2019s sort of silly that Meta can dictate and censor what our elected officials can say on a social media. This isn\u2019t an issue for like 99% of them, but the concept is just anti-democratic.The same could sort of be said about our journalists. If we had a press corps server instance, then someone posting that Tibet is a country or whatever \u201cradical\u201d thing you can get banned for, wouldn\u2019t become a conflict of interest. Because they\u2019d be allowed to write that, and our press corp genuinely couldn\u2019t give two shits what China has to say about it.replyspookie 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]As someone who has contributed to the Fediverse, I can assure you the EU hasn't been sleeping on this and has helped many other projects (not just Mastodon) through funding.Really, if anything, they've helped a lot of folks sustaining their contributions.replyrossng 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]To give a specific example, the EU has a funding programme called NGI to support 'next generation internet' projects. Some (all?) of this money is distributed through a small organisation called NLNet, who have decided to support a number of Fediverse projects:- Mastodon: https://nlnet.nl/project/Mastodon/- Lemmy: https://nlnet.nl/project/Lemmy/- Pixelfed: https://nlnet.nl/project/Pixelfed/- Misskey: https://nlnet.nl/project/Misskey/- Bonfire: https://nlnet.nl/project/Bonfire/And quite a few more.

Even historically powerful corporations like the British East India Company found the basis for their authority in a nation which eventually revoked their authority, assumed its debts and obligations, and took possession of their armed forces, equipment, claimed lands and authority and disestablished the corporation.replygsatic 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> This isn\u2019t an issue for like 99% of themThat's why 99% don't care or will ever care about mastadon. Just like all other EU funded efforts go nowhere.Social medias main features are - broadcast, Following others broadcasts, discovering what's trending. To the general public these are already solved problems on existing platforms.The reason they jump from blog posts to twitter, or Facebook to insta or from insta to tiktok is there is a new feature available.Mastadon does nothing new that the 99% think they need. In fact the main search results and discovery is a stream of total shit compared to other platforms.replyASalazarMX 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's why Fediverse apps are awesome, 99% of regular social media users are not there. But seriously, I believe their strengths are what will make them win in the end:- Rapid pace of development.- Focus on users instead of ads or investors.- You can become a dictator of your own instance, but no one gets to be dictator of the Fediverse.- Bad instances will get shunned by the rest.Of course, their biggest weakness if funding. So far donations can keep up with the small userbase, but the userbase will keep growing. Some popular Lemmy instances are growing at almost 100 GB per day already.replyBolexNOLA 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]>focus on users instead of ads or investorsI remember when we talked about Reddit the same way. We\u2019ll see if it lasts. I say this as someone who uses Kbin in particular a lot. I like it now but we\u2019ve been down this road so many times. It\u2019s hard not be skeptical.They also need to make the relationship between these different apps and how it all works easier to digest. And some quality 3PA\u2019s to fill in the gaps. I think Sync has plans to point at Lemmy so here\u2019s hoping we see that soon!replyASalazarMX 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> And some quality 3PA\u2019s to fill in the gapsYou mean third-party apps? The passion with which developers have been working on Fediverse apps lately is humbling. On iOS, the ugly child of open source apps, just for Lemmy there's Memmy, and in TestFlight, Mlem, Thunder, and LiftOff!. These last are still beta/alpha, but Memmy is mature enough to compare with the former third-party Reddit clients.The official Mastodon app recently got a much needed upgrade, and there are other good clients like MetaText, Ivory, and many more. If anything, there are too many choices now, the dust needs to settle.It's refreshing to see a fundamental questioning of the status quo (corporate lordship), and a disrupting and viable technology (Fediverse) making strides in the right direction.I might be biased because I remember a diverse Internet from before the corporate takeovers, and it seems like the Fediverse is attracting older adults who got to experience some of that diversity too: https://mastodon.art/@jsstaedtler/110668308409683502replyBolexNOLA 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Like I said, I am regularly on Kbin now. I like the fediverse concept as well. I\u2019m just somewhat jaded because like you I remember and enjoyed the more \u201cdiverse\u201d internet, warts and all.

It always felt wrong to me that Twitter was used for anything resembling official communication. Whether it be a local news network, fire station, local government or the president of the United States. All on the same platform that is filled to the brim with pornography and obscenities. Of course you can curate your feed and only follow what you want, but in my mind Twitter is a single website. I'm used to dedicated forums so when Twitter rolled around I figured it would just be a little bit bigger, but still mostly informal, unofficial people goofing off online. Once everyone and everything started using it I left. I don't want to mix online identities with real life identities.So, despite Mastodon being a federated system it makes a lot more sense to use a dedicated instance for official purposes like this to me. I imagine they don't federate with anything anyway and don't even allow account creation.replyandsoitis 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Why not just use a website? What advantage do citizens get by going to a social media site to keep a pulse on govt comms?replyvanilla_nut 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]No strong reason, but Mastodon allows various goverment officials and agencies to create accounts on the same server and probably has more functionality baked in than most self-hosted alternatives. It's got a better interface than a CMS and even allows those government officials to follow and interact with other accounts in an official capacity.Personally it feels ready-made for government presence on the web.replytoomuchtodo 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Wordpress for one to many.replyheavenlyblue 19 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]How would your average user \"follow\" several wordpress websites aggregated in a single timeline?replycmelbye 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The advantage is that the information can be aggregated along with posts from other sources rather than having to visit many different websites individually. It's easier to consume, the same reason why RSS was useful.replygochi 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This advantage doesn't work out when the officials are constantly splitting themselves around different social networks. So this just becomes \"if you're a twitter user it's easier than RSS\". Yet you still have to create another account to join the fediverse, then another for threads, then another for facebook, list goes on for each network that pops up and gains usage.replycmelbye 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That\u2019s the hard part about standards. I\u2019m not sure how a standard can become one without people taking a chance on it.Case in point: You actually do not need to create another account on Threads - it interoperates with this standard. Citizens will be able to follow information from the Dutch government on that platform.replygochi 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Technically, they need an instagram account to follow the dutch government on threads. Which kind of illuminates my point, for this to become standard we need far better implementation details than what activitypub currently describes.

I think it helps if you think about Mastodon as email. Government runs their accounts on government server, other users can interact with their content from other servers.As for people caring about a server for functional programming or some other niche, I believe this is just a temporary state of Mastodon and ActivityPub because it's such an early and experimental technology.I believe that in the near future there will be multiple large corporate hosted social networks supporting ActivityPub (running on Mastodon or something else, doesn't matter) and then the choice becomes clear for an average user - who do they want handling their data. There could be a Google activitypub service, something from Facebook (they said Threads will support it), different media companies could run their services. Phone networks and ISPs could offer ad-free instances bundled with internet and phone plans. And, of course, there will still be a ton of small niche communities owned by enthusiasts for a variety of topics.Celebrities and companies will most likely host their own instances, because an account on an official well-known domain acts as verification.The fediverse itself will be a neutral ground.replykeskival 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]No, Mastodon instances shouldn't be neutral. They should present their colors so that other instances can more easily decide whether to federate with them or not.replyguerrilla 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Governments are the obvious providers of such neutral ground.Quite the opposite.

It just makes sense to have companies and governments and other institutions run their own private mastodon instances, and us vast unwashed people who just want a free place to read the news and shitpost to follow on a site like Threads where advertising dollars cover the costs of servers and moderation. There's no reason that eg the BBC should be posting on somebody else's infrastructure, but it's obviously of benefit to both the BBC and Threads to have Threads users to be able to follow and boost posts from BBC's staff.replyDeukhoofd 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Hopeful? Didn't the Threads announcement literally state they were going to federate with Mastodon?> Soon, we are planning to make Threads compatible with ActivityPub, the open social networking protocol established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body responsible for the open standards that power the modern web.

Governments and companies can still decide to run their own ActivityPub infrastructure, running on Mastodon or something else. Threads and other services will federate with them, users will be able to follow accounts from those government and company instances.Small Mastodon communities can choose to not federate, but they would be missing out on a lot, assuming ActivityPub takes off.replykeskival 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I agree otherwise except on the missing out a lot part.I haven't defederated Threads on my instance as it has so far not become a problem. They can easily become one if they for example start pushing up ads into the stream.Most Mastodon users have what they want, they aren't really missing out on anything. Except ads and spying mainly.replydanijelb 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I agree for ads - I don't think it would be acceptable to push ads to other servers. I'm not sure if it's even possible in the standard because they'd have to have some sort of an ad account, but if the user on your instance is not following that account they'd never see the ad.As for missing out, I guess it's a matter of perspective. I would assume that right now most Mastodon users have at least one more account on a mainstream corporate social media site - Twitter, Instagram, whatever. What they are missing out from Mastodon, they get on other places.But if we imagine a scenario where ActivityPub becomes mainstream and all providers start supporting it, there are two totally different experiences.An experience of a person on a server that federates with everyone could mean having just one account and follow everything from one place. For example Twitter would support ActivityPub so you can follow Twitter users without an account there. You could follow a Youtube channel and have it in your feed. The owner of the channel wouldn't need to create a separate account on Twitter, Instagram, Mastodon, or something - their channel is their followable account on all platforms.The experience of a person on a small mastodon server that defederates from big corporate servers would be exactly as is today. To follow users of Instagram, Twitter, Threads, Youtube, etc you'd maintain another account. But in the future where ActivityPub is mainstream, that other account is also activitypub-compatible. So, why have two when one is less \"powerful\" than the other?Letting the imagination run wild, in such future scenario ActivityPub feeds could be integrated deeply into your iOS/Android phone UI, without needing a separate app. Perhaps also on TV. Most people will want an account that doesn't limit them.replykeskival 38 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm sure that ads thing is something they put 99% of their resources on. They can easily augment their users' posts by randomly adding ads into them when relayed to ActivityPub. They can also comment on posts automatically or half-automatically from ads accounts.They can also post as their users. Like YouTube, when you look at a video, they put ad videos there in the start and in between, so they could do something like that by posting ads on influencer accounts.They can also reward the people themselves for posting ads.Anyhow, I already got one spam message on Mastodon from that browser-embedded instance, Vivaldi, because they didn't do a great job in vetting their users. I was already ready to block them if I receive another, but I never did.They will find a way to push garbage on ActivityPub I have no doubt.Regarding defederation, there are different levels. Typically you would silence the instance but allow people to follow single accounts from there.If it's more powerful to be fully open, then an email client without a spam filter would be superior to one with a spam filter.Twitter is moving towards closing up their network from users not signed in. EU is making it mandatory for social networks to be interoperable though, so that pulls to the other direction. In any case, it's not a great future for the big social network corporations because people can choose to have either what they offer or roughly the same without ads or tracking.replyrickette 18 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]503, hugged to death.replyjojobaskins 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Same, until they can handle random request spikes twitter/threads will still be necessary.

If the custom was omitted or forgotten and the bees were not \"put into mourning\" then it was believed a penalty would be paid, such as the bees leaving their hive, stopping the production of honey or dying.[1]History and origins[edit]Little is known about the origins of this practice, although there is some unfounded speculation that it is loosely derived from or perhaps inspired by ancient Aegean notions about bees' ability to bridge the natural world and the afterlife.[2]The custom is best known in England but has also been recorded in Ireland, Wales, Germany, Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Bohemia and the United States.[3][4][2][5][6] One Lincolnshire report from the mid 19th century notes,At all weddings and funerals they give a piece of the wedding-cake or funeral biscuit to the bees, informing them at the same time of the name of the party married or dead. If the bees do not know of the former, they become very irate, and sting every body within their reach; and if they are ignorant of the latter they become sick, and many of them die.[7]After the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the Royal Beekeeper, John Chapple, informed the bees of Buckingham Palace and Clarence House of her passing and the ascension of King Charles III.[8] Chapple described the practice to the press as such: \"You knock on each hive and say, 'The mistress is dead, but don't you go. Your master will be a good master to you.'\"[9]Variations[edit]Death and funerals[edit]Following a death in the household there were several ways in which bees were to be informed and therefore put into proper mourning.The process is described in 1901 work of Samuel Adams Drake A book of New England legends and folk lore in prose and poetry:...goodwife of the house to go and hang the stand of hives with black, the usual symbol of mourning, she at the same time softly humming some doleful tune to herself.[1]One such \u2018tune\u2019 from Nottinghamshire had the woman (either a spouse or other caretaker) say \"The master's dead, but don't you go; Your mistress will be a good mistress to you.\"[2] Another similar oration recorded in Germany went \"Little bee, our lord is dead; Leave me not in my distress.\"[5]Another method involved the male head of the household approaching the hive and knocking gently on it until \"the bees\u2019 attention was thus secured\" and then saying \"in a low voice that such or such a person - mentioning the name - was dead.\"[1] The key to the family home could also be used as a knocker.[3]One description from the Carolina mountains in the United States says that \"You knock on each hive, so, and say, 'Lucy is dead.'\"[5]Bees could also be invited to the funeral.[5][6]In cases where the beekeeper had died, food and drink from the funeral would be left by the hive for the bees, including the funeral biscuits and wine.[3] The hive would be lifted a few inches and put down again at the same time as the coffin.[3] The hive might also be rotated to face the funeral procession and draped with mourning cloth.[3]In some parts of the Pyrenees one custom includes \"burying an old garment belonging to the deceased under the bench where the bee-hives stand, and they never sell, give away, nor exchange the bees of the dead.\"[5]Should the bees fail to be told of a death in the family, \"serious calamity\" would follow, not only for the family in question but also for any person who was to buy the hive.[2] For example, one record from Norfolk tells of a family who bought a hive of bees at auction from a farmer who had recently died and, because the bees had not been \"put into mourning for their late master\", they were \"sickly, and not likely to thrive.\" However, when the new owners tied a \"piece of crepe\" to a stick and attached it to the hive the bees soon recovered, an outcome that was \"unhesitatingly attributed to their having been put into mourning.\"[5]In 1855 Bohemian author Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1's novel Babi\u010dka (The Grandmother) ends with the title character saying \"When I die do not forget to tell it to the bees, so that they shall not die out!\" N\u011bmcov\u00e1's novel, which was filled with folkloric practices from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia, was based on ethnographic research N\u011bmcov\u00e1 had conducted in the region in the mid-nineteenth century.[10]Weddings[edit]Although the practice of telling the bees is most commonly associated with funerals, in some regions the bees are to be told of happy events in the family, particularly weddings.In Westphalia, Germany, one custom held that newly married couples going to their new home must first introduce themselves to the bees or \"their married life will be unfortunate.\"[5]A 1950s article in the Dundee Courier, Scotland, describes the practice of inviting bees to the wedding.[11] If a wedding occurred in the household, the hive might be decorated and a slice of wedding cake left by their hive.[3][6][12]The decoration of hives appears to date from the early 19th century.[3]One tradition in Brittany held that unless beehives were decorated with scarlet cloth at a wedding and the bees allowed to take part in the rejoicing they would go away.[5]In culture[edit]The custom has given its name to poems by Deborah Digges, John Ennis, Eugene Field, and Carol Frost.[13][14][15][16][17] R. T. Smith's poem \"Sourwood\" also references the custom.[18]A section from John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \"Tell the Bees\" describes the practice:Before them, under the garden wall,Forward and backWent, drearily singing, the chore-girl small,Draping each hive with a shred of black.Trembling, I listened; the summer sunHad the chill of snow;For I knew she was telling the bees of oneGone on the journey we all must go!\"Stay at home, pretty bees, fly not hence!Mistress Mary is dead and gone!\"In the Midsomer Murders episode \"The Killings at Badger's Drift\" (series 1 episode 1), a minor character remarks that a deceased character's bees must be informed of her death or they will \"just clear off\". The custom is also explained in \"The Sting of Death\" (series 21 episode 3) and the bees are in mourning with black cloth on the beehives. The ninth book in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series is entitled Go Tell the Bees that I am Gone.See also[edit]Bee (mythology)References[edit]^a b c Drake, Samuel Adams (1901).

In systems like WhatsApp, the distribution of keys is handled by the WhatsApp server.Read 16 tweetsMatthew Green@matthew_d_greenMar 28So a giant box just showed up in the CS department mailroom addressed to me.It\u2019s from Vietnam and the packing list says \u201cshirt.\u201d Uh oh.Starting to think this might have something to do with a tweet I sent a while back.Read 6 tweetsMatthew Green@matthew_d_greenMar 26The future of censorship-resistant communications is going to be distributing LLMs trained on dissident content, rather than the content itself.Imagine \u201cthe anarchist cookbook\u201d but it\u2019s a device-local chatbot that will answer all your (technical and ideological) questions interactively and persuasively.Read 5 tweetsDid Thread Reader help you today?Support us!

I see it as one of the \"big wins\" of the (US) judiciary because it has made the lives of many children joyous, across the globe.Plenty of old games on now obsolete platforms can still be enjoyed thanks to emulation. I hope the precedent never goes away.[1] https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/...replyNarishma 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]Doesn't that case only apply in the USA?replyleehuffman 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Who cares? This person is telling a story about their lack of access to cool new tech, and what projects like this one have provided them.Split hairs all you want but giving less privileged people access to funsies that eventually turn to deeper technical interest and (I assume) a higher earning career is the overarching message and I\u2019m all the way about that. The weird dissection of an uplifting & cool comment like OPs is classic HN & definitely unnecessary.Edit: And their reply resonates with me. Not fronting like I couldn\u2019t have those things, but I dug deep into retro gaming (via emulation) in my early teens and my career can be traced back to that original interest & deep diving.replyNarishma 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I just fail to see how a court decision in the US would have any effect on another country. It's not like OP's situation and access to emulators would have been any different if the decision went Sony's way.replyyaseer 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> It's not like OP's situation and access to emulators would have been any different if the decision went Sony's way.I would respectfully disagree - although it's hard to speculate on alternative histories.The United States has an outsized impact on the software industry - even for the largest economy in the world (American big-tech dominates the largest companies by market cap).Preventing or impeding the development of emulation software in the US would definitely impact the rest of the world, simply because fewer people and companies can legally contribute to open-source Emulation software.replybamfly 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]People and companies in the US have contributed a whole lot of hours to emulator development, such that it's plausible emulation would not be nearly as good as it is if such development were illegal in the US. Moreover, less effort may have been put into emulator development or emulation-based-product development by foreign companies, if they were legally unable to sell their products in the US, which is a large and rich market. Further, US copyright policy has a tendency to influence international copyright regimes, over the longer term.replybee_rider 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The actual mechanism seems pretty straightforward (the US is a big open country, if things can happen here somebody will do it and it\u2019ll spread across the world without many speedbumps).Their phrasing was a bit awkward though, when they say \u201cLuckily emulation has always been legal\u2026\u201d one would assume they are talking about the jurisdiction they live in, by default at least.replyWHYLEE1991 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]so straightforward that it makes you realize how comically bad some people here in the comment section are at understanding even broad strokes kinda implications about their and others actions.replyleehuffman 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You legitimately can\u2019t comprehend how a court ruling in the US would affect anything or anyone outside the US? For real?replymemsom 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Well - it depends on the topic really. And, not the fact a law exists in the US. A judgement in the US has no bearing on law in other countries, except where it is used to then set a presidency as others had said.US law is actually different enough from some other countries that what is legal in the US is outright illegal, and vice versa. If you want some low hanging fruit - anything to do with guns, gender identity, abortion, liable/slander and \"free\" speech - many countries disagree and actively oppose the US stand point, on both sides of the US position. Another good example is anything granted in the US constitution is not a \"God given right\" outside of the US (which probably intersects with guns and free speech, maybe other things). US passing a law is not going to change that.DMCA does not affect other countries - we have our own laws - some of which were put in place in line with the ideas that caused the DMCA, but some of which predate it. Also - \"fair use\" is a wholly US concept, and might not apply, depending on where you are located.replytough 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You just gotta look at DMCA or CopyrightreplyMindwipe 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Lol, I've got very bad news for you about where copyright came from.replytough 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Haha, didn't see that one coming ofc, stand corrected https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copyrightreplyRunSet 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> I just fail to see how a court decision in the US would have any effect on another country.By way of return, I fail to see how you fail to see precisely that.replyhighwaylights 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]At a guess, it at least doesn\u2019t discourage developers from working on the emulators in the first place.replypasswordoops 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]As demonstrated by copyright, US legislatures generally define global law when it comes to tech and entertainmentreplymemsom 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Not really. US copyright law is based around protecting the rights to use a \"work\", but European copyright law tends to protect the originator. It might seem similar, but in practice it is not.\"Fair use\" as an example, does not exist in the way defied in the US in the UK. We have \"fair dealing\" and it is a lot more specific. There are defined use-case exceptions to copyright, it is not \"do what you like, claim 'fair use' and take it down when you get a DMCA notice\".replyMindwipe 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Not really.The general standard length of protection (life plus 70 years) is from Germany for example.replydontlaugh 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The US is a significant market and emulators being allowed there helps emulators in general?replyASalazarMX 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If USA doesn't care about emulation, it means those specific copyright tentacles won't poke my government, hence my country (Mexico) also won't care. Even if USA cares, sometimes my country still won't care if it means spending a lot of money on policying the Internet.Sometimes, the love-hate relationship between Mexico and USA has its advantages.replyLeFantome 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It may be a US law but the result is greater availability of emulated tech. As a regular user, the legality of the emulator is secondary to the likelihood of the emulator existing.replypatmorgan23 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]International copyright law is somewhat harmonized through international treaties. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) actually implements what the US is obligated to when it joined the World Intellectual Property Organization.Copyright provisions regularly make their way into multi-lateral trade treaties (such as the Trans Pacific Partnership)replycausi 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yes, but it doesn't need to apply anywhere else for people everywhere to be able to access the software. It only needs one place where it can be openly worked on.reply_shantaram 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Seconded. My PC hardware was never very powerful either, but I had access to the entire library of (S)NES/GB(A) games to play on my mum's phone as a child.replydottjt 23 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]The fact they managed to achieve this astounds me.I grew up with the PS3 as a teenager, and I just remember being told how complex the architecture was, as well as just how powerful the system was. Keep in mind, the US Air force connected 1000+ of these together for super computing purposes....and now a large part of it has been emulated to a high degree and it kind of blows my mind. Will be crazy to think that the ps5 will likely be emulated on a computer within the next 20 years; perhaps easier so because of the simpler architecture.replyWingy 23 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The PS5 is already emulated on computers today to some degree. Kyty doesn\u2019t run any commercial PS5 games but it can run some homebrew PS5 apps.replykevincox 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The PS5 is basically a regular old desktop computer. The PS3 has a quite unique multi-\"cell\" architecture.replyxela79 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I can really recommend this tech talk regarding PS4 and PS5 hardware by their lead hardware architect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8LyNIT9sgsome really interesting topics related to what kind of performance they wanted as a baseline and how to optimize to make the PS5 do what it currently does... like no other platform.a $700 console that:- outputs 4k / HDR (upscaled from lower native res. ofc)- renders games steadily at 30 / 60fps- no hitches, framedrops- always records your gameplay- live video sharing of stream with PS friends- live streaming to youtube- updates of games being installed- downloads of games/dataall simultaneous, instant game switches, quick loading times. the experience cannot be replicated with a 1k gaming PC, not even a $2000 machine. They really delivered a device which is imho, more than just \"an AMD gaming PC with a custom GUI and some DRM\"would have loved to have widescale keyboard/mouse support, as playing Far Cry with a controller is frustrating at best. And keyboard/mouse support is in hands of the game dev if they want to support it or not.replytsukikage 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Performance is vastly helped just by not having a fragmented ecosystem or a moving target. If I know all my customers are running my software on the exact same hardware, I can optimise the hell out of my software, and also I can see exactly how it will perform for the end user and polish the worst bits until either it's shiny enough for me or I run out of budget.If every single user has a different setup with components chosen from a vast array of possibilities that can all do different sets of things at different speeds... well, I can get it to work on my machine, and I can try and guess what to degrade when things get bad, but ultimately I just have to throw it over the wall and hope it's not too terrible in the wild. It's impressive, really, that PC desktop games work as well as they do.replyxela79 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]that's the case for every console ever made after the 90s; here the fact that both gaming desktop PC and consoles share similar hardware pieces makes it imho that more interesting to be able to find use cases the deliver a better out of the box experience, and have it cost a fraction of the game PC budget.replyMikusR 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]- no hitches, framedropsThis statement alone is pure bullshit. So the rest should be taken with a pound of salt.replydagmx 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]While that one line is incorrect, it\u2019s a fallacy to use that to try and sow the seeds of doubt in the other points. People make mistakes in wording all the time and it\u2019s a low debate tactic to do what you did.The fact is some frame hitches are gone but obviously not all.The ones that will primarily be gone or largely mitigated are- shader compilation hitches, because console versions of games can ship with pre compiled shaders.- data transfer hitches because the consoles have shared memory and dedicated compression blocks to optimize transfer- system resource scheduling contention because the OS and other processes won\u2019t start interfering with the game process since they use dedicated resource allocation.replyxela79 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]thanks, on an internet forum, you'd expect some leeway, but alas, it seems it's worse than a technical paper ;)the OS and hardware working hand in hand to help overcome some of the causes for hitches and frame drops is what sets the consoles apart from the DIY PC builds where you simply don't have access to the custom design;and it's also imho where in this generation Sony has pulled ahead of Microsoft even if both are using similar hardwarereplysmoldesu 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> the DIY PC builds where you simply don't have access to the custom design;On Linux (or Steam Deck) you can precompile shaders for your specific hardware like Switch or PS5. There is nothing about \"DIY PC builds\" that prevent you from building an experience like this.replydagmx 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The steamdeck is a single known entity of hardware. For all intents and purposes, it can be treated like a console in that regards.But DIY PC builds, that\u2019s a wide range of hardware to support. And it\u2019s not just hardware, it\u2019s driver versions, OS versions and firmware versions.So it\u2019s possible to do what Valve does where the first playthrough caches the shader compilations and then stores them by a configuration hash, so subsequent users get it. But the sheer number of hardware and software permutations makes it significantly harder.It has nothing to do with Linux either.The shaders are therefore not precompiled in the same way they are for console. It just means that the second playthrough of a section is a shared experience taking advantage of the first users resources.If a game hasn\u2019t been played first, or you encounter an area of the game that hasn\u2019t been encountered before you, or you\u2019re on a slightly different hardware/software combination than the previous shader cache, you\u2019ll hit the stuttering again.replyBearOso 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I believe fossilize snapshots the entire pipeline configurations. It can then replay that and generate final hardware-specific binaries, not just SPIR-V, for the cache completely ahead of time.That's much better because it doesn't matter what hardware the first person used, the data can be used everywhere.replydagmx 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]True, the replay aspect does help as long as nothing invalidates the pipeline, which is still a higher possibility on PCs than consolesreplysmoldesu 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]That's not how Valve caches shaders on Steam. They accommodate those DIY builds by compiling them on-machine with Fossilize, converting them to system-optimized files. For DirectX titles like Elden Ring, this effectively eliminates all shader compilation stutter in-game. It also doesn't rely on fancy \"first playthrough\" setups, since it's translating and optimizing the original shaders wholesale.> It has nothing to do with Linux either.It's an out-of-box feature with Steam on Linux. You can run all of this stuff on Windows too, but you'd have to build it from source and configure DXVK environments for each game by-hand. On Linux it all happens automatically.replydagmx 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It\u2019s a factor of Steam not Linux. They could in theory do it for other platforms too.Fossilize does require at least one playthrough because shader permutations can be generated at runtime. There\u2019s no static shader setup that\u2019s common to all games. It just means that the first playthrough doesn\u2019t have to be the same person playing it right nowreplykevincox 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I'm not saying that the PS5 isn't a good performer for its cost. It is also clearly cost-optimized to do exactly those features without any resources wasted on extra hardware. But at the end of the day even if an equivalent desktop computer cost 5x as much the hardware and hardware architecture look identical.Sure, this will make emulation hard right now because you don't have the huge compute advantage that you do when emulating a PS3 on modern hardware, but you shouldn't have much difficulty matching the architecture, because it already matches. Basically a PS5 emulator can look a lot more like Wine as opposed to hardware emulation like you see for NES, N64 and similar consoles which were completely custom hardware.replyxela79 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]it's definitely done on purpose by Sony, to have PC grade hardware so they can port their games easily to the PC platform and have a larger install base for the first party titles, which previously only existed on the Playstation. All in all, I see it as a win for end users that they are converging as the software titles are available across multiple platforms. So price competition is very relevant. In a world experience worst inflation in decades, this is a very thin silver lining for sure.replywhoopdedo 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Consoles are a loss-leader so saying that the price is $700 doesn't tell you what it costs without including how much of a negative margin Sony was willing to take.replyitsTyrion 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> always records your gameplay > video share > live streamit's called hardware encoding video. it's great that those features are present, but HW encoding (even in consoles) isn't newreplyxela79 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]never said it was \"new\" have nvidia shadow play forever running and OBS for the better open source solution on a game PC; but that doesn't take away that the all-in-one polished end user experience is very nice and required some better planning.PS3 multitasking performance was horridreplyhypercube33 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]PS5 and Xbox SX are AMD Ryzen 4000 series x86 and a GPU slapped on a die with some memory so emulation isnt so far offreplydagmx 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The original Xbox proved that hardware similarity doesn\u2019t necessarily make emulation easy. It took a long while for OG Xbox emulation to be decent , and that was with it using fairly commodity hardware and a very DirectX api.The PS5 has custom APIs that would need to be reversed out, especially graphics APIs. It also has a large-ish pool of shared memory that makes it difficult to map to most PCs which don\u2019t have that setup.There\u2019s several custom hardware blocks for bespoke decompression that are routinely used and the equivalent to direct storage to speed up resource access.It\u2019s not impossible to port those games over as has been seen, but it\u2019s also not easy to emulate that if the specific game builds make use of those features (and many many games do)replyzirgs 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]OG Xbox took so long, because most of its exclusives were also available on PC. Halo 1 & 2, for example. So there wasn't much interest. Developers focused on more interesting systems like the PS2 and the GameCube at the time.replywolrah 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Also OG Xboxes were cheap and trivial to mod including converting in to debug consoles, so the homebrew community that often drives emulation didn't have as much reason to care. They could just install a debug BIOS, find a copy of the XDK floating around the ol' interwebs, and have basically the same toolset commercial game developers had.Now that unmodified OG Xboxes are being irreparably damaged by failing clock capacitors and the used market is drying up as a result the people who still care about the platform have more reason to want a good emulator.replyxienze 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think what we'll likely see is that it's (relatively) easy to get PS5 games running in a PC emulator, but running them _well_ will take ages. Primarily because PCs will have to be able to out-horsepower the PS5 by a wide margin to make up for things like the shared memory setup, texture streaming stuff, etc.replyjwells89 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah, PS5 games expect to have up to 16GB of VRAM available, and thanks to GPU vendors being stingy with VRAM to upsell to get that you\u2019d need to buy expensive high end cards.But that doesn\u2019t do anything to help with the PS5\u2019s shared memory architecture, where because VRAM and RAM are one in the same, textures that need to be in memory aren\u2019t duplicated between RAM and VRAM like on bog standard PCs, which has performance implications.Windows has support for streaming assets directly from SSDs like the PS5 does now (at least if you have a fast enough NVMe SSD installed, SATA SSDs or older NVMe drives won\u2019t cut it), but PCs still lack the hardware texture decompression of the PS5 which once again impacts performance.The mass market computers closest in architecture to PS5s are actually M-series Macs, with how they also have a large pool of memory serving as both RAM and VRAM. Once the integrated GPUs on M-series SoCs achieves parity with the PS5\u2019s onboard Radeon, they might actually be the most straightforward to emulate a PS5 on despite needing x86-to-ARM translation.replydagmx 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Excellent points on memory architecture. Though I\u2019d posit that the non-base M series GPUs are actually already equal or higher performing than the fairly aging Radeons on a PS4/5, depending on the respective SKUsThe wild cards will be translation overhead , differences in TBDR access and thermal headroom.replysmoldesu 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> PCs still lack the hardware texture decompression of the PS5 which once again impacts performance.They might not implement it the same, but hardware-accelerated texture decompression has been around on PC for as long as SIMD has existed.

The number of OpenGL games was minuscule though, and Apple's underlying APIs have broken now, rendering most of these games unplayable. Apple doesn't really provide a stable gaming runtime, outside of the DirectX-like promise that if you use their proprietary APIs they won't depreciate them.> The game porting toolkit works alongside wine and Rosetta to make time to first pixel easier for developers to consider the platform.See, that's the thing. \"time to first pixel\" was an issue because of Apple's APIs. If you translate non-native program calls into native ones, then obviously you circumvent the problem.Furthermore, the reason why Game Porting Toolkit didn't exist before now was because Apple had to write a Metal translator for DirectX. The community never wrote one like they did for Vulkan, likely because nobody wants to translate DirectX to a second proprietary API. Kinda defeats the purpose, at least for non-commercial contributors.> Most big engines support metal just fine already, so it\u2019s not the primary hurdle people claim otherwise we\u2019d see more unreal and Unity games running natively on Mac\u2019s.Most big engines also support PS5 and Nintendo Switch as development targets. The reason why they are relatively unpopular for porting is the exact same as Apple's - the APIs are nonstandard and closed, with limited distribution and long-term support options. Why would anyone put in the majority of their effort to support a minority of the market?replydagmx 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The number of Mac metal games is about the same as the number of Mac OpenGL games.

It\u2019s not meant as a general purpose translator , just to get people over that humpAnd again it\u2019s just down to market share.

People don't like porting to Switch or Playstation 5, there's a significant amount of development and testing overhead required to support either platform. The Switch has a decently popular SDK backed with Nvidia drivers, but requires deliberate ARM ports and very carefully written Vulkan code (if any). The PS5 is a little friendlier to PC-first devs, but still has a unique runtime and zero options for DirectX code. Both platforms require fairly bespoke versions of your game, compared to the \"press play\" porting experience of the Deck or API parity of modern DirectX on Xbox.I wish the situation was better for these platforms, but they reap what they sow when they make highly exclusive SDKs and resist open specification.> By the way, game studios don't have any issue translanting DirectX to LibGNM/X and NVN.Are there DirectX translators a-la DXVK for GNM and NVN? As far as I'm aware, porting from DirectX has to be done by-hand unless you're using an IR language like SPIR-V (at which point you may as well use native Vulkan).replydagmx 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I\u2019m sorry but this post reads like someone dyed a little too in the wool on Linux and hasn\u2019t worked in the video game industry.Except for indies, PS5 and switch get a ton of high profile games. Very few companies have issues porting over and most will have their engines able to target multiple platforms.Very few people use Vulkan on the switch. It, like the PS5, has its own graphics api.Very few games ,outside of the few indies that make their own engines, target DirectX or a specific APi. They use an intermediary HGI that abstracts over various backends so that they can target the wide range of console behaviour that exists from APIs to console specific features.Thinking about PS5 development from the perspective of DXVK or SPIR-V is the wrong way to think about it. Higher level abstractions coupled with low level backends make it easy for any well architected engine.Like the sibling comment says, please spend some time perusing the GDC vault or among professional game devs. Your world view on the matter is not representative of the those communities.

Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and Kaufman were Oscar nominated for adapted screenplay, and Sven Nykvist was Oscar nominated for cinematography.Other films based on his writing include 1965\u2019s \u201cNobody Will Laugh,\u201d directed by Hynek Bocan, which won the Grand Prize at Mannheim-Heidelberg Film Festival, 1969\u2019s \u201cThe Joke,\u201d directed by Jaromil Jires, which played at San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival, and 1969\u2019s \u201cI, the Distressing God,\u201d directed by Anton\u00edn Kachl\u00edk.Kundera was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1929. His first novel, \u201cThe Joke,\u201d was published in 1967, and was greeted with acclaim. French poet Louis Aragon called it \u201cone of the greatest novels of the century.\u201dIn 1968, the Prague Spring, a period of liberal reform in Czechoslovakia, was crushed by Soviet troops. Kundera criticized the invasion, and was subsequently ostracized by the Communist regime, and sacked from his post at Prague\u2019s FAMU film school. \u201cThe Unbearable Lightness of Being\u201d centers on the Prague Spring and its aftermath.In 1975, he emigrated to France, and was stripped of his Czechoslovak citizenship four years later.

He will paint the most symbolic picture of a situation, where every action speaks to that persons history and builds up the experience of X. Then he will rewrite the scene from a different point of view, and conclusively state that, no, actually everything meant Y.And then he will go on an, as a critic, analyze the book right there for you and what it means, in between the story.I love how he uses ideas from Hegel, Nietsche, Beethoven, Bach Stravinsky (all music history), etc. etc. etc. and dives deep into the poetry of one idea. For example in Unbearable, the eternal recurrence. That singular points of experience are as the tree falling in the forest when no one's around, it has no impact. That for an event to have weight it must happen repeatedly, in different contexts, stories, etc, but essentially the same occurrence, over and over again. What does that mean for your life and the patterns of your life?How much I've gone into rabbit holes of some great people exploring Kundera, and how much more beautiful Beethoven is to me now. He's made his Op. 111 one of my favourites.replyghotli 20 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]At one point in my younger years I read The Unbearable Lightness of Being, 100 Years of Solitude by Marquez, and Invisible Cities by Calvino all back to back.These books changed me for the better at the time and I think about scenes from each in my daily life all in about the same sort of way. Beautiful imagery, pointed human condition takeaways. Got under my skin and stayed there.Unbearable Lightness had such a quality in the writing that stuck with me wherein he would twist a scene into something else in the span of a paragraph or two. There's a scene wherein Tereza goes to the top of a hill that comes to mind. The entire opening of the book was at the time unlike anything else I had read.Makes me want to go re-read that era of my life again and explore more of each of those author's works.replyIaldaboth 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Sorry for the tangent, but reading your message reminded me of early-2000s literally websites dedicated modernist/magic realism/interstitial fiction, like The Modern Word.

(It's also written in a way that makes it really hard to turn into a movie, and the book explicitly mentions it in passing.)replydiego_moita 22 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]\"Unbearable Lightness\" is one of those books that changed me as a person.It isn't really too much of a novel because it has a very thin plot with very little drama or tension. It is more like a deep reflection. But it is very good.The book's perspective on human condition is very cynical. My understanding, when I read it, is that by \"unbearable lightness\" what the author means is that we are absolutely irrelevant and the whole idea of \"meaning of life\" is just pathetic.Yeah, I know: I sound like an atheistic teenager. But, please, don't get fooled. Kundera wrote a billion times better than me. He deserves to be read, even if I sound childish.If you like Albert Camus you'll love Kundera (and vice-versa).replywk_end 20 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Oof. You\u2019re really underselling it. It\u2019s more complex than you\u2019re giving it credit for, I think - it\u2019s not just a cynical \u201cnothing means anything\u201d kind of nihilism. Some of the characters hold a philosophy like that, but not all of them, and their ultimate fates don\u2019t exactly suggest that Kundera is endorsing it. The book asks, even in the face of that kind of cynical and over-intellectualized view of the world, why and how do we try to find meaning in our lives regardless? I don\u2019t see how by the end of it - which I\u2019m bringing myself to tears just thinking about - you could believe that Kundera thinks that project is \u201cpathetic\u201d.It\u2019s also, of course, a very political novel in its depiction of life in the Soviet Bloc and of popular movements. It\u2019s a very pointed critique of collectivism.replyagnos 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> The book asks, even in the face of that kind of cynical and over-intellectualized view of the world, why and how do we try to find meaning in our lives regardless?This. I don't get the sense that Kundera himself is advocating for either lightness or weight. The novel asks a question that's as much philosophical as it is psychological, and the beauty lies in the question itself rather than any answers.To quote Kundera: \"On the surface, an intelligible lie; underneath, the unintelligible truth.\"replyslibhb 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> The book's perspective on human condition is very cynical. My understanding, when I read it, is that by \"unbearable lightness\" what the author means is that we are absolutely irrelevant and the whole idea of \"meaning of life\" is just pathetic.The novel contains various asides where the author says what the book is about and it's not this.Heaviness and lightness are two different attitudes towards life. Lightness is not committing to anything, chasing experience, infidelity, pleasure, and so on. If anything, the novel comes down on the side of heaviness: tenderness, commitment, marriage, having a dog even though it will die, etc.replythe-smug-one 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I found the experience of the characters to be pretty moving and not irrelevant. Especially the woman who was cheated on repeatedly. Anyway, very fun book in that sooo much is repeated and the symbolicism is very heavy, makes it fun to find the patterns.If you read a lot of his books they all turn out to be pretty similar imho, but it fit my vibes when I was like 18.Another book that's great for re-reading is \"The master and Margarita\", pretty layered in terms of the different experiences you can have reading it.replyIaldaboth 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]\"The master and Margarita\" really bites hard in its satirical view of Moscow under the Soviets.

Sometimes if I just try to find more depth and meaning in a book just because of other people did, I stop to wonder, should I? Book with an uninteresting and shallow plot, with no depth in any way that pushed my thinking in some further direction, with a title I could not connect to anything in a book. Maybe it is just me and that slice of time in my life when I read it did not click. But I vividly remember the place I read it and how I wondered what am I missing hahaOn a side note, I think some books just click very differently with people. For example I could not for a love of anything in the universe connect such praise Peter Handke got for some of his work to my experience reading itreplysolardev 19 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Even though Lightness is one of my favorite books, it really won't speak to everyone. It has a lot of angst and philosophy and reflections on the human condition from the perspective of poly lovers during wartime, written by a male Czech author. Each of those could be a way to relate, or distance, the writing from the reader.In truth I don't even remember the plot, but I do poignantly remember the evocative language and beautiful prose, even in its English translation. It was just such a subtly piercing way to look inside people in everyday (yes, boring) situations as they struggle with love and meaning. It's the same \"big\" questions any literary novelist tries to tackle, but if that's not your jam, the writing won't do anything for ya. Nothing wrong with that. Kundera is a niche/cult favorite, not necessarily a mass market page turner.There are authors I dislike too, despite their popularity. Tolkien and RR Martin for their verbosity, Barbara Kingsolver for her tendency to go on long rambly tangents about her personal life. Thoreau had his ups and downs. Etc. There are more great books and authors than a person can read in a lifetime anyway. To each their own!replyoscillonoscope 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I understand what you mean about Tolkien, he describes seemingly random crap at length and doesn't really care about the plot, but it's not really accurate to call him verbose. The entirety of the Lord of the Rings has less words than two ASOIAF books or WoT books. I recently re-read LotR for the first time since childhood and what struck me is just how compact they are compared to modern fantasy.replymellavora 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, the thing with Tolkien, is he was telling stories which are meant to be TOLD, as in oral, spoken out loud.To an audience which might be falling asleep, or minds drifting as they stare at the fire.That's part of his magic, and few other authors match it.Contrast to Harry Potter, which is a stream of visual images.replysolardev 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Really? I tried to read the first few chapters but couldn't get into it... just seemed like so much unnecessary detail. What might be a minute or two in the movies took forever in the books.Maybe I'll give it another shot though, based on what you saidreplynine_k 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If the details seem unnecessary but keep reappearing, maybe it's because the author finds them necessary, important, or even the main subject of the work.I think there's a book where this idea is pushed to the utter extreme: it's Ulysses by James Joyce. Apparently it's a book about mundane people doing mundane things on a unremarkable day. But Joyce made a point to write a book about all these details, all this tissue of daily life which is commonly omitted in books, or even suppressed and distorted to fit to a stylistic or moralistic mold. I's a book about how a person lives a day on the low level, how maybe an alien would see it.replysolardev 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I mean, I love ethnographic or \"day in the life\" nonfiction books, learning about different real cultures that way. But when they're about fictional cultures, I dunno, it feels like it'd just be better to experience that in a RPG video game or movie or something... (as a matter of personal preference only).Of course authors are free to write as they wish. I'd never tell someone \"Yo, you have too much detail for my tastes.\" I just wouldn't read them again. They have their own fanbases, I'm sure, just as I have my own preferences for writing style. Nothing wrong with that, right? In fact I wish there were a good recommendation engine for books based on previous reads, writing style, setting, length, etc.replyoscillonoscope 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's a slow beginning. Tolkien focuses a lot on Hobbit culture as it's important to the morality of the narrative but it picks up very quickly. Oftentimes important events are only briefly summarized by one character to another as they meet up or narrated in brief chapters. That said, his writing style definitely isn't for everyone.replywatwut 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]ASOIAF are massively verbose tho.

It's great to read these comments from others who loved it too and reexamine that profound experience with this book.Of course I had to read the book again, here:https://archive.org/details/isbn_0060912529This is such a complicated book. On the first page, there is a statement about the unimportance of a war between African nations that \"altered nothing in the destiny of the world, even if a hundred thousand blacks perished in excruciating torment.\"The word \"blacks\" was triggering to me, it felt insensitive to speak of the death of a mass of people as insignificant, and then refer to those people as \"blacks\" (I'm adding that it feels like that stops at recognizing much more about them than the color of their skin). Though of course Kundera never used the term \"blacks\" himself, that was the translator: \"Nemus\u00edme je br\u00e1t na v\u011bdom\u00ed stejn\u011b jako v\u00e1lku mezi dv\u011bma africk\u00fdmi st\u00e1ty ve \u010dtrn\u00e1ct\u00e9m stolet\u00ed, kter\u00e1 nezm\u011bnila nic na tv\u00e1\u0159i sv\u011bta, p\u0159esto\u017ee v ni zahynulo v nev\u00fdslovn\u00fdch muk\u00e1ch t\u0159i sta tis\u00edc \u010dernoch\u016f\"(https://adoc.pub/kundera-milan-nesnesitelna-lehkost-byti.htm...)Google translates this entire passage with the word \"blacks\" as well, but the individual word \u010dernoch\u016f as \"black people.\"He also talks about Hitler, being touched by his portraits, and recalling that his family members perished in Hitler's gas chambers. That's a subtle discussion that would be dangerous today!But, the entire passage is his wrestling with what is significant and what's important, and how death and permanence changes our relationships to all that. Profound.replyinglor_cz 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]\u010cernoch is a neutral word for a black person in Czech. Not a slur. (\"Negr\" would be the slur, ironically taken from translations of Mark Twain; we had to import the slur from America.)Remember that for most Czechs until very recently, black people were characters from stories, if not fairy-tales, not someone whom they would actually ever meet in person. Until today, except for the biggest cities with international universities, the country is almost totally white with a few Vietnamese immigrants in between.The history of empires and subjugations took a completely different course here than in the former colonial and slavery powers to the west. Here, both the elites and the yoked ones were always native Europeans. Black people were, save a few documented individuals, as absent from local history as the Japanese samurai.replywatwut 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]There might be some nuance in English between \"blacks\" and \"black people\", but in Czech, \u010dernoch is a word for ... both.

McCoy / Getty ImagesA group of Democratic senators is urging federal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute some of the most popular online tax filing companies for allegedly sharing millions of taxpayers\u2019 financial data with Meta and Google. On Tuesday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and others asked the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Treasury Department, and the IRS to investigate whether TaxSlayer, H&R Block, and TaxAct violated taxpayer privacy laws by sharing sensitive user information with the two tech firms.Senators also released their own report Wednesday detailing the accusations, first raised by The Markup last November. The report alleges that for years, tax preparation companies infused their products with Meta and Google tracking pixels that revealed identifying information \u2014 like a user\u2019s full name, address, and date of birth. The senators also suggest that some of the information provided, like the forms a user accessed, could be used to show \u201cwhether taxpayers were eligible for certain deductions or exemptions.\u201d The senators claim that the companies did not receive user consent to share this information, which could violate laws banning tax preparers from sharing tax return information with third parties, especially since much of this data could be used for advertising purposes. \u201cThe findings of this report reveal a shocking breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms that appeared to violate taxpayers\u2019 rights and may have violated taxpayer privacy law,\u201d the senators said in their Tuesday letter. TaxSlayer, H&R Block, and TaxAct all confirmed that they shared \u201cextensive taxpayer data\u201d through Meta\u2019s pixel in the senators\u2019 report. After The Markup published its November findings, each of the companies said they had \u201cremoved or disabled\u201d it from their websites. 2 COMMENTS2 NEWFEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGETesla Master Plan 3 in 4 minutesAt Tesla\u2019s Investor day, Elon Musk\u2019s company pulled the curtain back on its latest Master Plan 3.0, as well as details about its plans to grow to \u201cextreme size.\u201dMost PopularThe FCC aims to stop SIM swappers with new rulesThe Mac sure is starting to look like the iPhoneFTC appeals its loss to Microsoft in Activision Blizzard caseMicrosoft wins FTC fight to buy Activision BlizzardThe best Amazon Prime Day deals under $25Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.Email (required)SIGN UPBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Go ask your favorite law school professor about this, they will confirm that I am right.Historically all land belonged to the sovereign. The US didn't like the idea of kings, so under our common law all land belongs to the US government.And you get your rights to your piece of it because the law recognizes that you should have and deserve to have monopoly rights.But if it wasn't fundamentally the property of the US federal government, where would the government get the legal jurisdiction to enforce the monopoly rights it has granted you? The US government will not enforce any property rights you may think you have in Mexico.See, I'm not questioning private property, I want you to be able to own land. I'm looking at it in its proper full legal context.Now you want to restrict voting rights to land owners, probably thinking some variant of \"no taxation without representation\", right? But recall that the fundamental owner is \"we the people\", not \"we the individual to whom the people have granted a monopolistic usage of what we the people own\".So yes, since every citizen is in fact the land owner, then the single tax principle by default meets your criteria of restricting voting rights to land owners.And since I've met your criteria, welcome to the movement.

They all were registered in the last six months, supposedly by Stubhub itself (nobody actually verifies the accuracy of WHOIS data though, its all an honor system)It seems to me like there is probably a hustle going on, where someone is buying tickets under fake names and flipping them. Is this something Stubhub is known to do (SeatGeek pretty openly does it with their return program).

The emails are aliases to verify the tickets are valid, then they are forwarded to the buyer.Usually the format is <email prefix of buyer>@<stubhub controlled domain> and the tickets are forwarded pretty quickly.

The \"double dipping\" doesnt work out even before you factor in the overhead.This is not to say they aren't manipulating market.

Stubhub based on their volume has a sense of where the market is, and if they see a seller underpricing versus what Stubhub thinks the ticket will sell for, they may swoop in and try to capture some of the upside.There's no such thing as a ticker feed for the resale markets -- the market is characterized by \"imperfect information\".

This would also cut down on customers telling them they didn't get a ticket transfer (if they really did) and also ensuring that sellers actually transfer tickets. An easier method of all of this would be to have a way to work directly with Ticketmaster or AXS or whoever to act as an escrow agent for ticket sales, but considering AXS and Ticketmaster have their own resale services, I'm sure they make that as difficult as possible.I have to think that the biggest ongoing costs to an operation like StubHub or Seatgeek or Vivid or any of the other marketplaces are fraud and customer service related to lost ticket transfers. So anything you could do to mitigate both of those (which acting as an intermediary would help with both) would be worth it.Siderant: The thing that kills me about the resale/scalper nonsense is that in response, some venues are now doing anything they can to limit resales at all -- requiring you to pick up tickets from will call and show ID and credit card used to pay. So then you have to hope that whoever sold their extras on Craigslist or FB actually shows up at the venue so you can get your GA seat you paid way too much for, or else you're SOL. And like, look, I get it, you want to cut down on scalping. But things come up and people can't always attend shows. Or some of us will literally pay stupid prices to see someone live -- but when the venues put in onerous terms and check ID at the pickup window, that's just stupid.replysokoloff 16 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]For most of those (valid) concerns, having stubhub openly act as the intermediary would probably be better as far as I can tell.If I\u2019m selling my ticket on stubhub and I get a request to transfer the ticket to some stubhub.com email address, I feel more secure that it\u2019s legit than a scammer.replyohyes 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Sounds like ticket price arbitrage. Pick up undervalued tickets, resell them at a higher than listed price. Stubhub has all the correct stuff to do this, high speed api access, data about historical ticket prices. They could even list their estimated price first and find the buyer before purchasing at the lower price. If that doesn\u2019t happen quickly then list the original price.It\u2019s basically an unregulated ticket stock market.replyhnburnsy 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]This, I wouldnt be suprised if Stubhub had already resold the tickets at the same time they purchased from the original buyer.replywussboy 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]color-geographicfeature-orgdesignation is their name generator, at least.replyuser070223 16 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]https://namegrep.com/#%28%3Acolors%3A%7Ccrimson%7Camber%7Cem...None of the the domains listed in this thread appear to be taken (the site uses godaddy to verify, and is updated every 24h), but there are others in this scheme that may be related.replyThrowawayh89 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]How'd you determine that?replyzerocrates 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The poster and some comments give examples of the domains: crimsonhillpartners, ambercovecapital, emeraldsummitadvisors.replyavree 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Other examples of Stubhub e-mails include \"fieldmilestone\" and \"rolodexinfo\". I believe that Stubhub is using old domains, probably from some list that their registrar is providing them. Sometimes, there are blocks of patterns, such as the color/etc. one - but they're probably doing this to avoid getting spam-filtered by people's mail clients, not to try to hide from Ticketmaster or anything else, and I doubt the naming is something they are defining.replyzerocrates 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]All the ones I've seen are quite recent, 2023 creation dates. Your \"fieldmilestone\" is one such.Obviously they're not literally all the color+feature+company pattern but I don't think they're just reusing old \"real\" domains either.As for not getting spam filtered, using a big pile of new domains with no web presence probably has the reverse effect so I don't think that's the intention here. Also I think as it's described, these emails aren't really sending messages to people, they're there to receive emails from Ticketmaster or similar entities when you go to transfer though them.replykreeWall 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This ^^replycypherpunks01 15 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]In the past for some time, Stubhub used a single Gmail box for routing certain transfers. I'd receive instructions to transfer to: Buyer: Firstname Lastname Email: mobiletransfertickets+12341234@gmail.comWith a different +number for different transactions, this happened numerous times in 2022 across multiple shows, so I think it was Stubhub, not an outside party. At other times, it'd have me transfer directly to the buyer's email address.They probably moved away from the single Gmail address for some reason, over to their own domain names they control? I don't think it necessarily implies they are buying your tickets, just that they are routing the transfers through them possibly for verification.replylondons_explore 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a team of people all logged into that gmail address manually verifying and forwarding tickets.After all, processing PDF's and images of tickets forwarded from customers automatically and reliably is probably very hard.replynimbius 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Stubhub: Hello my name is Mr. Snrub and I come from some place far away.

Spent $20 but split the bets between ten games and chose the players I would play against. For all ten games, I lost but the other players all used the same team.

    "hn_summary": "- Stubhub is suspected of buying their own tickets under fake names and flipping them for a profit.\n- The email addresses associated with the tickets have domains that appear to be businesses but don't have websites or a presence in Google search results.\n- Stubhub may be using the fake domains to avoid being identified by Ticketmaster and other ticketing companies and to obscure their involvement in ticket resales."
