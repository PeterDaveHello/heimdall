    "content": "(Illustration by Elena Lacey/The Washington Post)Listen7 minComment1168Gift ArticleShareFake reviews are ruining the web. But there\u2019s some new hope to fight them.The Federal Trade Commission on Friday proposed new rules to take aim at businesses that buy, sell and manipulate online reviews. If the rules are approved, they\u2019ll carry a big stick: a fine of up to $50,000 for each fake review, for each time a consumer sees it.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.That could add up fast.It\u2019s the biggest step to date by the federal government to deter the insidious market for buying and selling fake reviews, though the FTC\u2019s rules don\u2019t do as much to hold big review sites like Yelp, Google, Tripadvisor and Amazon directly accountable. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Interim chief executive Patty Stonesifer sits on Amazon\u2019s board.)You\u2019ve seen it before: Thousands of conspicuous five-star reviews for a borderline product. Perhaps even a merchant has offered to pay you to leave a positive review. This kind of fraud undermines our collective power as consumers. (Has a fake review wasted your time or money? Send me an email.)Advertisement\u201cAnyone who\u2019s done any shopping online knows that trying to actually get objective information about the product is so fraught because there\u2019s so much commercial misinformation, so many deceptive reviews,\u201d says Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.Skip to end of carouselGeoffrey A. Fowler(Se\u00f1or Salme for The Washington Post)Geoff\u2019s column hunts for how tech can make your life better\u2014and advocates for you when tech lets you down. Got a question or topic to investigate? Geoffrey.Fowler@washpost.com. Read more.End of carouselAs many as 30 percent to 40 percent of online reviews are fabricated or otherwise not genuine, consumer advocacy groups and researchers like U.S. PIRG estimate, though the rate of fakes can vary widely by type of product and website.There are global businesses dedicated to generating fake reviews for scammers and merchants looking for a shortcut. And the problem threatens to explode in an era of artificial intelligence like ChatGPT that can generate remarkably humanlike writing.Yet the federal government\u2019s approach to the problem has been to address it largely case by case through lawsuits \u2014 until now.What the FTC\u2019s fake-review rules doThe FTC\u2019s view is that fake reviews have always been against the law because they mislead consumers. But its proposed rules, which are open for two months of comment before they could be codified, would draw some bright red lines that clarify who\u2019s responsible \u2014 and empower the FTC to take more action.AdvertisementSo what\u2019s against the rules? No-gos include reviews that misrepresent someone\u2019s experience with a product and that claim to be written by someone who doesn\u2019t exist. Reviews also can\u2019t be written by insiders like company employees without clear disclosures.The rules apply not only to the people who write fake reviews, but also the middlemen who procure them and the companies who pay for them and know \u2014 or should have known \u2014 they were fake.Fake patient reviews are making it increasingly hard to seek medical help on Google, Yelp and other directory sitesThere are some gray zones. What if a business asks its real customers to leave them a review? The FTC tells me that\u2019s still allowed because it\u2019s a critical tool for small businesses to build an online reputation. The rules also don\u2019t specifically forbid giving legitimate customers a gift card for leaving a review, so long as they\u2019re not required to express a particular opinion \u2014 though it\u2019s a good idea to disclose that if it\u2019s a significant amount of money.AdvertisementThe rules also forbid a few more shady tactics such as review \u201chijacking.\u201d That\u2019s when a merchant takes a product listing page filled with legitimate reviews and swaps in a different product that those customers never actually used. (Earlier this year, the FTC made its first enforcement action for this practice, fining a supplement maker $600,000 for doing this on Amazon.)A business can\u2019t run a website that claims to host independent reviews while covertly selling its own products and services, something that happens a lot with tech products. A business also can\u2019t suppress negative reviews, such as by using intimidation or legal threats.\u201cIt\u2019s really important to deter the practice up front, so that the people or businesses that engage in these practices know that they could face a really heavy price,\u201d says the FTC\u2019s Levin. In addition to the $50,000 per-case fine, the FTC would also have the ability to retrieve money directly for consumers harmed by the fakes.AdvertisementSo how are they going to enforce this? The FTC says codifying rules can help it be much more efficient in court \u2014 but it isn\u2019t actually getting any additional enforcement resources. It could also still face hurdles trying to go after offending businesses that are based overseas, if they\u2019re in countries that don\u2019t have a history of working with the FTC.What the FTC\u2019s fake-review rules don\u2019t doMany consumer advocates say really fixing the problem requires addressing the entire fake-review economy.For starters, Facebook, Twitter and other social media provide all-too-easy forums where companies can easily recruit and hire fake-review writers. Facebook has taken down some fake review groups, and Amazon last year sued leaders of more than 10,000 fake-review groups.How merchants use Facebook to flood Amazon with fake reviewsAnd most of all, review platforms and retailers such as Yelp, Google and Amazon have the ultimate control over what they publish on their sites, as well as the most information about who\u2019s leaving the reviews. These big companies decide which reviews they leave up, what kind of proof they require to leave one \u2014 and also profit from having them.AdvertisementYet the FTC\u2019s rules wouldn\u2019t extend liability to either social media or review sites themselves, unless the companies are directly involved in procuring the fake reviews. There\u2019s also no requirement for sites to verify a user\u2019s identity or that they really used a product.\u201cMany of them assert immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,\u201d Levine says, a reference to the law that makes online forums not responsible for the content others publish on them. That would make it hard for the FTC to hold them accountable, even if it wanted to.The companies claim they take it seriously: Amazon says it blocked more than 200 million suspected fake reviews in 2022, and Yelp says in 2022 its software identified 19 percent of reviews as \u201cnot recommended.\u201d\u201cWe applaud the FTC\u2019s proposed ruling to take action against fake reviews and testimonials and plan to share further comments on the proposed rule,\u201d Yelp General Counsel Aaron Schur said in a statement Friday.AdvertisementEarlier this month, Google sued an individual and company who it says posted 350 fraudulent Google business profiles and tried to bolster them with more than 14,000 fake reviews.The problem is even that\u2019s not enough. \u201cIn any given day, I can \u2026 find thousands of fakes myself without any automation. That\u2019s just me alone \u2014 one person,\u201d says Kay Dean, who runs the organization Fake Review Watch. \u201cThey don\u2019t have much incentive to self-police \u2014 there really are no repercussions.\u201dOne idea: Review sites could be more transparent about when they\u2019ve taken down fake reviews so that consumers and outside investigators can better track the activity. \u201cWe deserve more data and more transparency into what led to review content being displayed,\u201d says Saoud Khalifah, founder of Fakespot, which uses AI to try to flag fake reviews.The big review sites are running out of excuses. \u201cRegardless of the liability regime, it is in the interests of consumers and the businesses that use these platforms for them to be policing this problem better. They have the most visibility into what\u2019s happening, they are in the best position often to stop it, and we want them to be doing more,\u201d says Levine.Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

At both stores the clerk opened the box, removed the packaging and handed it to me... while throwing away the box. I realized that the boxes have holograms, QR codes and serial numbers to check authenticity. So, I bought another and asked to keep the box. Checked the QR, and sure enough it went to a dead website \"e1fbar.com\", obviously not legitimate. I entered the serial on the real website and it said it was not authentic, too. Word online is that a huge amount of these products are counterfeit - Elfbar says they have helped identify and shut down over 120 organizations selling fake products.

When I put the second card in and run an OpenCL program, half the time it kernel panics and you have to reboot.He also talks about user space stuff but clearly he thinks the whole stack, above and below this kind of library also needs a lot of work.replyiforgotpassword 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This is still so mind-boggling to me. AMD should be in a good financial position now that Zen was such a success, and that their GPUs are catching up too. Why are their drivers still a Clusterfuck across the board after all these years? Why not throw more manpower at the problem?I'm sure even if their GPUs were twice as fast as Nvidia's, everybody would still buy team green because it's better to have a card that works than a broken piece of garbage. We tried to get an MI50 to work reliably at work with KVM, but that thing was a complete dumpster fire. A colleague just bought a 7900XTX for gaming and spent days getting it to work. This included three Windows reinstalls. And that use case is gaming on Windows, which supposedly is the best supported case. It only gets worse from there. Compute on Linux? Lol.Now last time this topic came up, someone claimed that AMD is pretty much at their limits production wise, and there are a few unnamed large companies buying loads of their cards for compute and cloud gaming, and AMD basically has engineers dedicated to making sure things work exactly for their use case, so they don't have to really care about the rest. Sounds pretty wild, but not completely unrealistic...replyhedora 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I've had the opposite experience under Linux.My old nvidia 570's drivers went into severe bitrot. Basic stuff like screensavers and desktops broke badly, and games were flaky. The card is still more than powerful enough for what I used it for.I switched to AMD, with open source drivers. I get windows-level performance on AAA (and indie) games in steam, and zero compatibility issues with the rest of the Linux ecosystem.replyamlib 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]AMD GPU support in linux is a bit of a flip flop. Some generations seem to get a lot of love and work really damn well (sometimes with better and broader support than the windows drivers) like RDNA2 and most Polaris cards. Others such as Vega and specially now RDNA3 are a shitshow with a lot of things just broken.replygcoakes 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I used a Vega64 for years and just bought a 6000 series. Both work great on my machines. I'm typically running the bleeding edge kernels though, so that might explain it a bit. I would think Ubuntu is probably the most supported if you opt for the OEM kernel.replytyfon 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I ran vega 64 in linux for 3-4 years, it was really nice. It also worked without bugs with proton, the 3060 I have now gives me a lot of artifacts like incorrect lightning and even X crashes once in a while.I'm considering switching back to an AMD card due to this.replyaseipp 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It really depends on the card. I have an old RDNA workstation card in my server and the driver was a real crapshoot. I eventually started delaying updates to newer kernel releases (which would fix other bugs!) because there would be regressions of various kinds. Graphics under Linux is still a bit painful after all these years.At least Nvidia finally open sourced their driver too, I guess. And Intel is still open source. But it still sucks a bit I think unless you do research.replyfiddlerwoaroof 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yeah, I\u2019ve always bought AMD for this reason since some really bad experiences with Nvidia cards.replyizacus 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Why are you talking about screensavers in a CUDA thread though?

But that\u2019s outside of my area of expertise. Maybe they need to spend too much engineer effort and time supporting the consoles at what\u2019s probably a pretty thin profit margin?replyNarishma 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The previous generation as well, and the one before for Xbox 360 and Wii, and the one before for Gamecube.replyroadbuster 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Why not throw more manpower at the problem?Oh, of course.replyiforgotpassword 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]No, really. We've worked with Intel, Nvidia and AMD... Well for the latter, at least tried. We're not a big fish, but response time and quality of responses were stellar with Intel and Nvidia. AMD took weeks and even when asking very precise questions with lots of technical background, there was a lot of \"hmm dunno have to find someone who'd know\" kind of answers, and it would often take one to two weeks for a single reply. And that's not even dev work, it's just tech support for your own damn stuff you're trying to sell.You can't seriously tell me that's not something they could fix.replycwillu 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Par for the course with new kernel things: it's unusual for something new in the kernel to be stable in the distro kernels unless they've devoted a great deal of effort to backport things.replyarthur2e5 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The way conservative distros define \"stable\" is part of the problem.

CUDA and DirectX seem too low level to be used as a compatibility API over widely divergent hardware (AMD vs NVidia) without giving up a lot of performance.cuDNN being higher level offers more opportunity for compatibility without losing performance (i.e different implementations of kernels fine-tuned for optimal performance on AMD vs NVidia hardware), but the trouble is that so much of what frameworks like PyTorch do is based on custom kernels, not just cuDNN.It seems the best bet for AMD would be a rock solid low level API (not a moving target) and support of high level optimizing ML compilers to reduce the level of effort for the framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX ...) vendors to provide framework-level support on top of that. Ultimately they'd need to work very closely with the framework vendors to provide this support, since they are the ones who would be benefiting from it.It's odd how much of an afterthought ML support has seemed to be for AMD over the years... maybe the relative size of the consumer ML market vs graphics/gaming market didn't seem to make it worth their effort, but as NVidia has shown this is a path to gaining much more lucrative data center wins.replyskocznymroczny 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]How does it work?
