    "originBody": "owenwengerd 3 14h It is with great sadness that we announce John’s death on Friday, February 2, 2024. He was born in Maryland, USA to William and Bertha Walker, who preceded him in death. John is survived by his wife Roxie Walker and a brother, Bill Walker of West Virginia. Declining to follow in his family tradition of becoming a medical doctor, John attended Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to pursue a future in astronomy. However, after he discovered the brave new world of computers, he never looked back. John worked at the university’s Project Chi (X) computing center where he studied computer science and earned a degree in electrical engineering. John met Roxie on Thanksgiving Day in 1972, and they married the following year. Roxie and John drove cross-country a few months later for John’s new job in California. Eventually he left that first job and worked at various others in the bay area. In late 1976, John designed his own circuit board based on the then-new Texas Instruments TMS9900 microprocessor. This venture became Marinchip Systems, and eventually led to Autodesk. The beginnings of Autodesk are well documented by John himself in The Autodesk File 931 and from there John’s story is best told by John himself in his prodigious work, which is all methodically organized and available to the public at his website Fourmilab 655. 15 created 14h last reply 6h 3 replies 6.1k views 3 users 46 likes 3 links 2",

In 1977 this business was fun—the sellers and buyers were hotshot techies like ourselves, everybody spoke the same language and knew what was going on, and technical excellence was recognised and rewarded. Today, the microcomputer industry is run by middle manager types who know far more about P/L statements than they do RAM organization. They are the people who determine whether you succeed or fail, and their evaluations are seldom based on technical qualities. Hence, the first thing any venture in this field has to be is businesslike. I felt that way in the early 90s with PCs programming and late 90's with the Internet.

Once your company is large enough to be just a single team, and starts requiring too much time to keep track of all things happening and what each employee thinks and does, managing becomes a dedicated job and delegating management requires dedicated managers.

Cheers John https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker%27s_Diet reply masto 6 hours agoparentMe too, though it was more like 25 years. If someone asked me \"who is your hero\", I would answer John Walker. To be honest, I didn't know all that much about him beyond The Hacker's Diet, his own autobiography/Autodesk File, and the stuff on his web site circa 15-20 years ago. But the things I did know seemed admirable: * He was an engineer's engineer, and when his company became successful, the impression I got was that he stayed one. * The Hacker's Diet is a good example - approaching weight loss as a problem to be solved the same as any other: by learning what's known about it and using empiricism and data. * As far as I can tell, at some point he decided he had achieved all the money he needed so he went off to Switzerland and became a sort of mad scientist, pursuing whatever interested him for the rest of his life. Including things like the hotbits random number generator, where he installed a radiation source in his basement and used it to serve random bits up via a public web API. None of us are perfect, and it's best not to know too much about one's heroes, so I didn't. I looked up to the John Walker in my mind as the person I want to be when I grow up, and this sad news hits hard. reply paulpauper 5 hours agorootparentIt's basic CICO, from having skimmed it. The problem is this type of diet has the greatest likelihood of failing. CICO is hard to maintain. Eventually willpower fails and gradual overeating begins, leading to surprisingly large and abrupt weight regain. Being persistently hungry all the time just sucks. Some of the stuff is possibly wrong, like this There's a lot of nonsense floating around regarding exercise and weight control. The only way to lose weight is to eat less than your body burns. Period. Exercising causes your body to burn more, but few people have the time or inclination to exercise enough to make a big difference. An hour of jogging is worth about one Cheese Whopper. Now, are you going to really spend an hour on the road every day just to burn off that extra burger? There is scant to zero literature to suggest exercising raises metabolism. Recent research by Herman Pontzer shows the opposite, that calories burned with exercise are negated later through lowered BMR and NEAT. So if you do a 400-calorie run and then eat a 400 calorie cookie, you will still get a net 400 gain, or close to it. reply Kon5ole 1 hour agorootparent>It's basic CICO, from having skimmed it. The problem is this type of diet has the greatest likelihood of failing. I couldn't disagree more. THD is not really a diet, it just explains the baseline facts of weight loss and enables you to choose whatever diet that works for you. It takes the mystery out of it. You may gain weight one week and lose weight the next, but you will know why. The hackers diet makes a very convincing argument that any diet that works is in fact \"CICO in disguise\". The key point being that \"Calories in\" is not whatever is printed on the box, it is instead /what your body has absorbed from it/. So for example when you eat 3000 calories of salmon in bearnaise sauce as part of your Atkins or whatever and you lose weight, clearly your body is not absorbing 3000 calories (for whatever reason). If you follow the hacks in THD you will discover this, and any other effect various foods have on /you/. It will also help you discover if a 400-calorie run actually works for you or not. I am very thankful to Mr Walker for writing THD. He gave me the tools to \"fix myself\" when I notice that I have put on a few, and I have used those tools successfully many times. reply gumby 4 hours agorootparentprev> CICO is hard to maintain. Eventually willpower fails and gradual overeating begins, leading to surprisingly large and abrupt weight regain. The key difference, for nerd hackers, is the floater/sinker graph and the average. Some apps do this these days, though it seems to be less common than it was a few years ago (e.g. Withings and Apple no longer present their data that way). So as long as the sinker is below the trend you will lose, at some rate. You don’t have to be starving yourself unless you have a fetish, just stay below the trend line. When you have a spurt of enthusiasm you can drive yourself lower; when you are finding it hard, just try to stay below trend. It’s a manual form of gamification. reply masto 4 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a time and a place, man. Well actuallying on an obituary isn’t it. reply peblos 5 hours agorootparentprevDidn't want to delve into it in the original comment but what you mention is correct and is one of the reasons I mentioned how far back this was. I haven't read Herman Pontzer's recent research, I'd equate to becoming a more efficient runner; as efficiency increases energy demands are reduced. Some of today's research just didn't exist when this was written. Of course, some of the advice was already debatable by the time I got to read it in the mid-late 00's, but that can be said for a lot of health and fitness advice even today. I didn't follow it proscriptively. What it did do was give me a different approach to tackling it as a problem and was the first resource I had read that helped in that regard. Everything else was very much eat less of this and more of that Like thread's asking which book/resource to use when learning to code, there are many good examples out there. Not all are perfect, and some are occasionally wrong but like that example, this was the one that stuck with me. reply kiba 4 hours agorootparentprevThere is scant to zero literature to suggest exercising raises metabolism. Recent research by Herman Pontzer shows the opposite, that calories burned with exercise are negated later through lowered BMR and NEAT. So if you do a 400-calorie run and then eat a 400 calorie cookie, you will still get a net 400 gain, or close to it. You could achieve a constant NEAT by having a daily step goal or some prescribed amount of activities outside your exercise routine. I am supposed to do 2 hours of exercise per day plus give or take 10K steps. This can easily make me extremely active by American standard. Now, surely your BMR will compensate, but probably only to a certain point. In the end, it's probably easier to just eat healthy and eat less rather than trying to increase your caloric expenditure, but that's also rather hard to do for a variety of reasons. reply lazyasciiart 1 hour agorootparent“Supposed to”? Is this a lifestyle/athletic goal, or a medical recommendation (or something else)? reply imp0cat 4 hours agorootparentprevAlso, regular exercise will have more benefits than just increasing your caloric expenditure. It keeps your muscle mass from deterioriating as you age. reply tpm 1 hour agorootparentprev> So if you do a 400-calorie run That's not enough, the energy will be provided by glycogen stored in muscles and fat stored in the liver and those will be restored quickly. What happens if you do a 3000 calorie bike tour is the interesting question. Exercising raises metabolism at least during during the exercise (anything different would be a physical nonsense) - the issue is not exercising enough. reply btilly 6 hours agoparentprevLikewise, but more like 20 years ago for me.

Autodesk has lost a legend and his legacy will live on. reply Animats 3 hours agoparent> AutoCAD is a transformative product It really was. It replaced manual drafting. Drawing revision before AutoCAD involved maintaining a master drawing and updating it manually with pencils and erasers. Final drawings were inked in. Copies were made by running master drawings through a blueprint machine. When there were too many revisions, someone had to redraw the drawing by hand, and the copy had to be checked by hand by a checker. There were CAD systems before AutoCAD, but they either required a more expensive computer than an PC, or they couldn't handle a drawing too big for memory. The big innovation in AutoCAD is that it had a paging system for working on drawings too big for the machine. The code was paged in and out in segments. The drawing was paged in and out in sections. (I did some of the early AutoCAD ports to non-IBM PCs. Compatibility hadn't been established yet. Everything needed a driver. AutoCAD had \"more drivers than Yellow Cab\" at one point.) reply cronix 2 hours agoprevI fell in love with 3D Studio in the 90's.

A quick read of his 2003 \"The Digital Imprimatur\" at https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/ tells me he didn't like these changes either. For one, around 2000 he thought \"the emergence of viable international OpenSource alternatives to commercial software seemed to guarantee that control over computers and Internet was beyond the reach of any government or software vendor—any attempt to mandate restrictions in commercial software would only make OpenSource alternatives more compelling and accelerate their general adoption.\" reply Zetobal 2 hours agoparentprev [–] I dunno what to say mate but what a horrible thing to comment especially when he left in 1994.

    "originLink": "https://www.alexmolas.com/2024/02/05/a-search-engine-in-80-lines.html",
    "originBody": "A search engine in 80 lines of Python February 05, 2024 · 26 mins · 4718 words Last September I hopped on board with Wallapop as a Search Data Scientist and since then part of my work has been working with Solr, an open source search engine based on Lucene. I’ve got the basics of how a search engine works, but I had this itch to understand it even better. So, I rolled up my sleeves and decided to build one from scratch. Now, let’s talk goals. Ever heard of the “Small Website Discoverability Crisis”? The problem it’s basically that small websites, ones like this one, are impossible to be found using Google or any other search engine. My mission? Making those tiny websites great again. I believe in bringing back the glory of the little guys, away from the Google SEO frenzy. In this post I will walk you through the journey of buliding a search engine from scratch using Python. As usual, all the code I’ve written can be found on my GitHub (microsearch repo). This implementation doesn’t pretend to be a production-ready search engine, just a usable toy example showing how a search engine works under the hood. Also, let me be sincere and admit I’ve exaggerated a little bit in the post title. Indeed, the search engine I’ve implemented is around 80 lines of Python, but I’ve also written some complementary code (data crawler, API, HTML templates, etc.) that’s over makes the whole project a bit bigger. However, I think the interesting part of this project is the search engine which has less than 80 lines. PS. After writing this post and microsearch I realized that Bart de Goede did something similar a couple of years ago. My implementation is very similar to Bart’s, but in my case, I think I did some things better, in particular (1) my crawler is async, which makes things much faster, and (2) I’ve implemented a user interface that allows to interact with the search engine. microsearch Now, let’s delve into the components that make up microsearch and explore how I crafted each element: (1) the crawler, (2) the inverted index, (3) the ranker, and (4) the interface. In the following sections, I’ll provide both theoretical descriptions and practical details on how each concept was implemented in my project. Crawler The first step to building a search engine is to have data to search. Depending on your use case you can crawl existing data (as Google does) or you can use your own data (as Wallapop or any other e-commerce/marketplace does). Since one of my intentions was to build a “local Google” I decided to use data from the blogs I follow to build the search engine. In this case, crawling consists of downloading and cleaning all the posts of a certain list of blogs. To make it easier I’ve only crawled posts of blogs with RSS 1. And to make it faster, I’ve used the asyncio Python library. Using asynchronous code has sped up the crawling time from 20 minutes to 20 seconds. In my case, I’ve used a list of 642 RSS feeds. Of these feeds around 100 are the ones I usually read (blogs about ML, data science, math, etc.), and I scrapped the other 500 from surprisetalk blogs.hn project. Crawler code Inverted index An inverted index is a data structure that maps keywords to documents. This data structure makes it trivial to find documents where a certain word appears. When a user searches for some query the inverted index is used to retrieve all the documents that match with the keywords in the query. To implement the inverted index I’ve used a defaultdict with the signature dict[str, dict[str, int]]. This is, a mapping that given a word (a str) returns another mapping from URL (a str) to the number of times that word appears in the URL (a int). The default value of the mapping is a mapping from URL to 0, so if we try to get the value of a keyword that doesn’t exist in a URL we get a zero. The logic of the inverted index is defined within a class called SearchEngine. We initialize it with two private dicts. class SearchEngine: def __init__(self): self._index: dict[str, dict[str, int]] = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)) self._documents: dict[str, str] = {} Then we implement the index methods, which receives an URL and its content, normalizes the content (ie: remove punctuation, everything to lowercase, etc.), and then add it to the index. def index(self, url: str, content: str) -> None: self._documents[url] = content words = normalize_string(content).split(\" \") for word in words: self._index[word][url] += 1 To make the indexing process more usable we can implement a bulk index option, which receives a list of URLs and documents and index them. def bulk_index(self, documents: list[tuple[str, str]]): for url, content in documents: self.index(url, content) Finally, we can read the index using the get_url method, which receives a keyword and returns the URLs that contain the keyword. def get_urls(self, keyword: str) -> dict[str, int]: keyword = normalize_string(keyword) return self._index[keyword] For example, to index the document Foo with the text Hello, World! My name is Foo!, and the document Bar with the text Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo! and then search for the word Foo, we can do it as >>> from microsearch.engine import engine >>> engine.index(\"Foo\", \"Hello, World! My name is Foo!\") >>> engine.index(\"Bar\", \"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!\") >>> engine.get_urls(\"foo\") defaultdict(, {'Foo': 1, 'Bar': 1}) >>> engine.get_urls(\"Foo\") defaultdict(, {'Foo': 1, 'Bar': 1}) Ranker Once you have a set of matching documents for a given query, you need a way to sort them. The most famous ranker is Google’s PageRank, which ranks documents based on the links. However, other options to rank the documents exist, such as BM25, which ranks documents based on the content. In my case, I decided to use the standard BM25. The score between a query 𝑄 and a document 𝐷 is computed as ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 IDF ( 𝑞 𝑖 ) 𝑓 ( 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝐷 ) × ( 𝑘 1 + 1 ) 𝑓 ( 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝐷 ) + 𝑘 1 ( 1 − 𝑏 + 𝑏𝐷avgdl ) where the query 𝑄 contains the keywords 𝑞 1 , 𝑞 2 , …, 𝑞 𝑛 , the document 𝐷 has length𝐷, the average length of a document is defined as avgdl , 𝑘 1 and 𝑏 are free parameters, 𝑓 ( 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝐷 ) is the number of times that keyword 𝑞 𝑖 appears in the document 𝐷 , and finally IDF ( 𝑞 𝑖 ) is the inverse document frequency, computed as IDF ( 𝑞 𝑖 ) = ln ⁡ ( 1 + 𝑁 − 𝑛 ( 𝑞 𝑖 ) + 0.5 𝑛 ( 𝑞 𝑖 ) + 0.5 ) where 𝑁 is the number of documents and 𝑛 ( 𝑞 𝑖 ) is the number of documents containing 𝑞 𝑖 . There are other ways to compute the IDF, but apparently, you can justify this option from theoretical grounds. With all this math we are ready to implement the missing part of our SearchEngine class. Firstly we add the constants 𝑘 1 and 𝑏 as parameters of our class class SearchEngine: def __init__(self, k1: float = 1.5, b: float = 0.75): self._index: dict[str, dict[str, int]] = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)) self._documents: dict[str, str] = {} self.k1 = k1 self.b = b now we expose some useful properties that we’ll use later @property def posts(self) -> list[str]: return list(self._documents.keys()) @property def number_of_documents(self) -> int: return len(self._documents) @property def avdl(self) -> float: return sum(len(d) for d in self._documents.values()) / len(self._documents) With this information, we are ready to implement our BM25 scorer. The first thing we need to implement is the inverse document frequency method def idf(self, kw: str) -> float: N = self.number_of_documents n_kw = len(self.get_urls(kw)) return log((N - n_kw + 0.5) / (n_kw + 0.5) + 1) and with this method, we can finally implement the BM scorer. This method receives a keyword and returns a mapping from all the URLs that contain that keyword to their score. def bm25(self, kw: str) -> dict[str, float]: result = {} idf_score = self.idf(kw) avdl = self.avdl for url, freq in self.get_urls(kw).items(): numerator = freq * (self.k1 + 1) denominator = freq + self.k1 * (1 - self.b + self.b * len(self._documents[url]) / avdl) result[url] = idf_score * numerator / denominator return result This method receives a keyword, and for all the indexed documents it computes the BM25 score for that keyword. With this method we can finally implement the search method, which will be the one we’ll use to make queries to our search engine. The search method receives a query, normalizes it, extracts its keywords (ie: splits it by space), computes the BM25 scores for each keyword, and returns a dictionary of URLs with their total score. def search(self, query: str) -> dict[str, float]: keywords = normalize_string(query).split(\" \") url_scores: dict[str, float] = {} for kw in keywords: kw_urls_score = self.bm25(kw) url_scores = update_url_scores(url_scores, kw_urls_score) return url_scores Following the same example as before, we can use it to search as >>> from microsearch.engine import engine >>> engine.index(\"Foo\", \"Hello, World! My name is Foo!\") >>> engine.index(\"Bar\", \"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!\") >>> engine.search(\"foo\") {'Foo': 0.19869271730423296, 'Bar': 0.16844281759753774} >>> engine.search(\"foo bar\") {'Foo': 0.19869271730423296, 'Bar': 0.8088260293054897} Putting everything together, we have a search engine class that implements the functionalities to index and search documents in less than 80 lines of code. Complete code to have a search engine in 80 lines of Python Interface Finally, once we have a search engine, we want to expose it somehow. In my case, I decided to build a small FastAPI app that exposes an endpoint with the search engine, and then it also renders a simple webpage that allows you to search. To make the output easier to read I decided to just select the top-N URLs. FastAPI search engine app If you run it you’ll see something like Search Engine interface. then you can introduce your queries using the search box and search the indexed documents. For example, if I search for how to build a search engine? Search results for the query `how to build a search engine`. I’m aware this is not the nicest UI ever, and the UX can be improved a lot. However, it works fast, the results aren’t so bad, and most importantly, I’ve built it myself from scratch. Missing features For the readers who usually work with search engines, it’s obvious that there are a lot of missing features in my implementation. This is a non-exhaustive list of what it’s missing. This implementation doesn’t have query operators, ie operators that allow you to tune how the query behaves. For example, if you google how to build a search engine -solr you’ll get results that don’t contain the word solr in them. The reverse index works by indexing single keywords, and there’s no option to index n-grams. Google allows you to search for \"search engine\" (notice the double quotes) and it’ll only show you results where the two words appear in this specific order. Also, this implementation doesn’t have query or document expansion, so if you search engine you won’t get documents with the word engines. The crawling and indexing parts are independent but we could implement it in such a way that the indexing happens during the crawling, ie: as soon as we have a document we index it. This could be done asynchronously as well. Conclusions I’ve enjoyed a lot working on this project. It has helped me to understand better how Solr works under the hood, and while I still have a lot to learn I think I have a better intuition now. As a side effect, I’ve also learned how amazing is writing asynchronous code for IO-bounded operations. My first implementation of the crawler took ages to finish, and with the async implementation, it took a moment to finish. My next step on my journey to build a personal search engine is to implement semantic search capabilities in the search engine. I’ve been playing a bit with embedding models and ANN, so my next step is to add this functionality to microsearch. Keep tuned for more!

Most of the difficulty in search is dealing with the data volume. The logic itself is surprisingly easy, or it can be. Of course you can complicate it endlesssly, but this project successfully cuts most of the fluff... So with that in mind, approaching the problem not as one of how to make the search engine bigger, but the data smaller (physically or better signal/noise ratio) goes a very long way. reply cabalamat 9 hours agoprevLooking at the code (src/microsearch/engine.py), we have: class SearchEngine: def __init__(self, k1: float = 1.5, b: float = 0.75): self._index: dict[str, dict[str, int]] = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)) self._documents: dict[str, str] = {} self.k1 = k1 self.b = b I've no idea what `k1` or `b` are.

But type hints also work as documentation. We can have both. However, in this particular case the undescriptive names are like this for historical reasons.

It only imports collections, math and string, all in the standard library. Maybe it'd be more accurate to call it a search engine engine though. The crawler and interface aren't counted towards that goal, but they are obviously needed in some form, and the implementations presented add a bunch of lines and a lot of libraries. But even then, those libraries aren't related to search engines. If we start counting generic dependencies like pandas and fastapi, we might as well start counting the millions of loc of the operating system needed to run this search engine, and the firmware in the network card. Maybe even account for the complexity of the hardware this is running on. reply lijok 12 hours agoparentprevWhy not celebrate the achievements of the industry allowing us to build something like this in 80 LOC? reply Drakim 12 hours agorootparentI mean, I could import this achievement in my own project and build a search engine in 1 LOC. reply hombre_fatal 10 hours agorootparent\"X in N lines\" is interesting because it's going to show you the minimal implementation of the interesting or central part of the solution without all the other moving parts of a production system, usually for the purpose of demonstrating how something works.

What is the cyclomatic complexity of Facebook? :) reply lqet 1 hour agoprevNice! It wouldn't be much work to add fuzzy-search functionality (all results with a prefix edit-distance below some threshold delta, so that a search for \"hackrnew\" matches \"hackernews\"). Basically, what you would do is you add an additional inverted index, but this time the keys are n-grams of words in your document collection (typically 3-grams), and the postings are the words (or their ID) in which these n-grams occur. There is then a nice lemma that basically says the following (where PED is the prefix edit distance, and N(x) are the n-grams of word x): If PED(x, y) = |N(x)| - n ∙ delta That is, x and y must have at least |N(x)| - n ∙ delta n-grams in common to have a PED(x, y) less then or equal to delta. If you now have an input x, you calculate N(x) and retrieve all postings from the n-gram index for each n-gram of x. You can now merge all of these postings and get a list that looks like this: [worda, worda, worda, wordb, wordb, wordc] (for each q-gram x and some word y have in common, you get one entry of y). If you merge the duplicates, you get: [(worda, 3), (wordb, 2), (wordc, 1)], and for each y (in this case, worda, wordb, wordc), the number in the corresponding tuple is |N(x) ∩ N(y)|. If this number is larger than |N(x)| - n ∙ delta, you explicitly compute PED(x, y) and check whether it is below your threshold. If the number is smaller, you can simply skip it, saving you large amounts of costly PED calculations. Your result is a list of words y with a PED(x, y) to the input x below some threshold, and you can then use this list of words to query your existing index. I used this approach many years ago to implement a fuzzy client-side JS search engine on https://dont.watch/ (if you look into the JS code, you can see that the inverted index and the (compressed) n-gram index are simply transferred in the JS-file). The actual search engine is around 300 lines of JS, with no external dependencies and some very basic heuristics to improve the search results). reply maaaaattttt 12 hours agoprevI like it!

Google is definitely taking too many liberties in interpreting the query, but there are many things any search engine should do that will be a straight improvement over not doing them. The problem with Google search right now is that it's hard to reason about why it gives the results it does, seemingly because they rely too heavily on embeddings to compare strings. It's frustrating when \"cat food\" matches \"dog restaurant\" because the two were semantically close in some embedding space that doesn't quite align with human reasoning. reply adw 10 hours agoprevThis is very cool and very educational.

And once you do, odds are you'd find most of the runtime spent in very small portions of code doing fairly basic composable operations on large compressed arrays, and you can get very far with just rewriting a tiny core in something faster.

Building a search engine from the ground up to tackle small site discoverability? That's a challenge I can get behind. I'm especially into how you used asyncio in Python for faster crawling – smart move. But, let's talk scale and features. As it stands, handling bigger data sets or adding more complex search features might be tough. On the features side, playing around with query operators or n-gram indexing could seriously level up your search results. Expanding beyond RSS for content could also give your engine a nice touch.

It is true however that it is not necessary for majority of blogs. If you would like to do more then selenium would be a way to solve \"cloudflare\" protected links - sometimes even selenium headless is not enough and full blown browser in selenium is necessary to fool it's protection - sometimes even that is not enough - then I started to wonder, why some RSS feeds are so well protected by cloudflare, but who am I to judge? - sometimes it is beneficial to cover user agent. I feel bad for setting my user agent to chrome, but again, why RSS feeds are so well protected? - you cannot parse, read entire Internet, therefore you always need to think about compromises. For example I have narrowed area of my searches in one of my projects to domains only. Now I can find most of the common domains, and I sort them by their \"importance\" - RSS links do change. There need to be automated means to disable some feeds automatically to prevent checking inactive domains - I do not see any configurable timeout for reading a page, but I am not familiar with aiohttp. Some pages might waste your time - I hate that some RSS feeds are not configured properly. Some sites do not provide a valid meta \"link\" with \"application/rss+xml\".

    "originBody": "“Wherever you get your podcasts” is a radical statement 06 Feb 2024 tech You've heard the call to action at the end of nearly every podcast you've ever listened to: \"Listen to us on your favorite podcast app\", or in the phrasing of podcaster extraordinare Roman Mars, \"...wherever you find podcasts\". (By the way, you should be radicalized by the recent 99 Percent Invisible episode on how \"cooking with gas\" is mostly a conspiracy, and inspired by the absolutely incredible Power Broker book club.) Post by @theromanmars View on Threads But here's the thing: being able to say, \"wherever you get your podcasts\" is a radical statement. Because what it represents is the triumph of exactly the kind of technology that's supposed to be impossible: open, empowering tech that's not owned by any one company, that can't be controlled by any one company, and that allows people to have ownership over their work and their relationship with their audience. A little background See, podcasting as a technology grew out of the early era of the social web, when the norms of technology creators were that they were expected to create open systems, which interoperated with tools by other creators and even other companies. This was based on the successes of earlier generations of the internet, like email and even the web itself. Podcasting was basically the last such invention to become mainstream, with millions of people listening every day, and countless people able to create in the medium. And of course, it creates tons of oppportunities for businesses too, whether it's people making amazing podcasts like Roman Mars does, or giants like Apple or Spotify building businesses around the medium. Contrast this to other media formats online, like YouTube or Tiktok or Twitch, which don't rely on open systems, and are wholly owned by individual tech companies. On those platforms, creators are constantly chasing the latest algorithmic shifts, and are subject to the whims of advertising algorithms that are completely opaque. If a creator gets fed up enough to want to leave a platform, they're stuck — those viewers or listeners are tied to the company that hosts the content. But in the podcasting world, creators can (assuming they work out the business deals necessary to do so) actually take their ball and go home, because the underlying \"feed\" — the special file that podcasting apps look at to know when there's a new episode — is something they can actually move over to a new system or a new host, without losing all their subscribers or followers. Indeed, this idea of having a \"portable\" audience is so appealing that it's even been revived in the new wave of open format-based social networks that have arisen. When I found out that my Mastodon account was hosted by a company that was kind of shady, I was able to move it over to a Mastodon account run by Medium, and it was basically seamless for my followers, even though I had one of the biggest Mastodon follower counts in the world at the time. That capability is something most podcasters can do if they ever want to, too. Follow the money Many times, the value of open technology systems can be measured by which ecosystems they extract dollars away from. Yes, some of the economic value of podcasting came by making a dent in things like terrestrial radio broadcasts. But a big part was also the fact that the open formats of podcasting make it extremely difficult to do the kind of surveillance-based advertising that has made companies like Google and Facebook worth trillions of dollars. In fact, despite their immense scale, neither of the biggest ad-based platforms on the internet can enable you to buy ads on podcasts. In that way, podcasts have reintroduced the wonderful kind of advertising inefficiencies that we saw in the heyday of print magazines, where advertisers were hoping that some part of the audience would mail back one of those blow-in cards that used to be sandwiched into the binding of a magazine. (Kids, ask your grandparents.) Advertising inefficiencies are fantastic! In the ad industry, the old (likely apocryphal) line one would always hear is, \"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.\" But for creators, and for the world, that inefficiency was often wonderful. The inefficiency of old media formats resulted in less surveillance of the purchasing and behavioral habits of individuals, and larger surpluses that sustained a healthier, more vibrant media ecosystem that could even afford to invest in important stories or content despite the fact that they might not have a large audience. What podcasting holds in the promise of its open format is the proof that an open web can still thrive and be relevant, that it can inspire new systems that are similarly open to take root and grow. Even the biggest companies in the world can't displace these kinds of systems once they find their audiences. And that's not to say that there aren't shortcomings or problems with these systems, too. But, for example, when someone makes a podcast that's about encouraging hate, there's no one centralized system that can automatically suggest it to an audience and push them down a path of further radicalization. And of course, the winner-takes-all world of media being consumed by tech means that the economics of individual podcast production are often brutal now, sometimes simply because creators can't rely on outsourcing advertising sales to one of the big platforms. An open system isn't a panacea for all that's broken in the media ecosystem. But what we can take away from hearing \"wherever you find podcasts\" at the end of every episode we listen to is that, sometimes without us knowing, radical systems can survive and even thrive in the modern world of tech and media. They can inspire new creators to make similar systems that are unowned, uncentralized, and a little bit uncontrollable. And in this era where we're seeing the renaissance of the open web, they point the way toward a future where we can use the same tone to say \"wherever you find news\" or \"wherever you find your friends online\", and know that it means that there's a way that our lives online could be fully in our own control. ← Personal blogs are where tech news happens",

The entire podcast ecosystem rests upon the shoulders of Apple's podcast directory, which Apple has been freely hosting and allowing everyone to use rather than choosing to lock it down. For the longest time Apple's podcast client was by far the biggest player in the industry, so they had a lot of power to change this if they wanted to. Given Apple's general money-grubbing ways (see: the App Store), this is somewhat surprising. Presumably the podcast directory product happens to be owned by someone in the org who has some idealistic commitment to it being open, and/or the overall podcast industry is too tiny for them to think it's worth the hassle to push monetizing it. (Now Spotify's the biggest podcast platform, I gather, and I think we should all be glad that they don't have the power to just do unhindered monetization of podcasts because of Apple's counterbalancing them.) reply alberth 11 hours agoparent> The entire podcast ecosystem rests upon the shoulders of Apple's podcast directory Check out: https://www.listennotes.com Listen Notes is an indie run service by a single person.

[...] And yet they're trying to squeeze app developers for all they're worth. It's because Apple was emboldened by the fact that the original June 2007 iPhone exceeded sales expectations of 10 million units without any 3rd-party apps. The App Store didn't exist until July 2008. In June 2007, consumers were getting in line to buy the so-called \"Jesus phone\" even though there were no 3rd-party apps ecosystem for it. (Look back at the hundreds waiting in line overnight to buy the first iPhone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iSE0bBgUsQ) So, Apple rationally concludes that 3rd-party developers need access to Apple's customer base more than customers need access to outside developers. Back in 2008, the developers en masse could have revolted and said \"fuck the Apple iOS SDK, fuck the App Store, and they can fuck off with their stupid rules and 30% fee\" -- but they didn't. Instead, developers grumbled and complained while they were submitting apps to the App Store. Developers -- via their actions -- keep signaling to Apple that Apple has the leverage and not the developers. That's why you had 2008 articles and threads such as this: - This Is Why iPhone Developers Put Up With All the Bullshit From Apple (daringfireball.net) - 46 points by sant0sk1 on Sept 19, 2008hidepastfavorite23 comments https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=308975 reply hinkley 15 hours agorootparentAnd prior to the app store, app writers dealt with carriers who wanted 70% of revenue, not 30%. There was no money in phone apps prior to the App Store. I had left the mobile industry by then because I'd seen enough to know that mobile companies were just a funnel of VC money to goods and services for carriers who looked a hell of a lot like Ma Bell (employed some of the same people, in fact) While the iPhone was certainly interesting tech, that's not what made a bunch of devs learn Objective C. It was money. That Apple has only lowered their fees one, one and a half times in that period is how we end up with all the grumbling we have today. but at the time it was much much better than the status quo. reply FireBeyond 8 hours agorootparent> And prior to the app store, app writers dealt with carriers who wanted 70% of revenue, not 30% Disagree there.

This is false (If developer accesss to apple and androids app stores were competing even the tiniest bit, then you should mainly see developers releasing apps on one platform and not the other). in essence, this means that in order for developers to achieve negotiating power parity, they would need to form a cartel, (an illegal anticompetitive practice they would not be able to defend). As a result, Apple's negotiating power advantage is a matter of law. reply nemothekid 15 hours agorootparentprev>Apps also sold iPhones This seems apocryphal.

I do not know what you are talking about here. Apple has a podcast index. Podcasts do not need Apple's podcast index for anything. You can find a feed by going to the podcast's site and clicking on it, or googling the name of the podcast + rss. Or in any number of ways, really. Apple is one of many podcast indexes.

Yes, you can manually add a feed in most clients but that is not how most people use their podcast app. They search for podcasts in their app of choice.

Caught me somewhat by surprise one day when I walked past a hospital and got an ad in a podcast for that very hospital (GeoIP for my mobile IPv6 is correct at the zip code level). In fact, Spotify even allows podcasts to deliver their own MP3s (if you meet the requirements for their \"Passthrough\" program), which gives distributors that don't want to use Spotify's ad platform more control and is probably a condition for them even listing on Spotify. By default, and presumably also for old Spotify Connect devices that only support Vorbis, they reencode all files and cache them on their own CDN. reply Axien 7 hours agoparentprevApple was late to the game. In fact they tried to change the name away from podcast (in reference to the iPod). The TWiT team started calling them NetCast to appease Apple.

Apple did not invent or even have a choice. reply sailfast 16 hours agoparentprevThey would not have been able to change it, since the podcast client was reliant on the standard of distribution which was open.

Apple's vision of web apps was as second class citizens to Apple apps. The outcry was because those web apps, despite caching and saving and other things could not and would not ever be able to do what an Apple app could. Sherlocking/f.luxing/Dark Skying (maybe less so, the last) is bad enough as it is, but far worse when those as web apps could never do what an Apple app could (f.lux is a perfect example, there was, and I could never imagine a world where Apple would allow a web app to control color temperature on their phone). reply tootie 17 hours agoparentprevApple is still the biggest. Spotify is still second. There's a big gap between them and and even bigger gap to third place. More interestingly, Spotify rose to second by investing a gazillion dollars acquiring both a bevy of software tools (Megaphone, chartable, anchor), entire production studios like Gimlet and shelling out huge sums to take the biggest shows like Joe Rogan and Call Her Daddy private so they were Spotify exclusive and no longer available via RSS.

It's just that they can't because their business sucks. reply WesleyLivesay 19 hours agoprevHaving been involved in podcasting for almost a decade now, I take a generally pessimistic view of the future the RSS based distribution system of podcasts. It largely only exists because of decisions made by Apple many many years ago that they have not gone back on. They set their APIs to public which allows a podcaster to submit to Apple and then all of the various podcast distribution platforms can pull in that data to allow you to subscribe to the RSS on their platform. Apple's introduction of Podcast Subscriptions was their first move away from this model (with Apple hosting the audio) and I wouldn't be surprised if they moved to get more control in the future. When Spotify entered the market they paid a lot of money for exclusive content, but for the 99% of podcasters their interaction with the space was the same as Apple, submit your RSS and it serves it from your hosting. However, Spotify also bought two podcast hosting platforms: Anchor and Megaphone which ends up blurring that line a bit. As far as I know the Anchor/Megaphone hosted podcasts are not treated differently by Spotify, but that could change at any time. The recent change from Google with the retiring of Google Podcasts in favor of Youtube Music is a tremendous step in the opposite direction. Youtube Music does NOT use the RSS based distribution method, with podcasters uploading their files directly to Youtube. Google even offers an RSS import. From all of the metrics I have seen the above three platforms make up 80%+ or so of the podcast user base. So if they made changes to make things less open podcast creators would be forced to follow. Making it feel like the openness of podcasts is, at least in 2023, more of an illusion or an act of charity than anything else. reply neurotixz 18 hours agoparentIm running a very small podcast hosting company, and spotify is NOT a good player in this space. They are not respecting the standard in any way. As an example, instead of linking to the source url, they make their own copy and serve that instead in the app, so the hoster does not see any downloads, cannot do statistics, etc. It also add copy protection... They also do not refresh the original URL regularly or the content, so if a change was made to the file , description or image it will not show up on spotify unless you do some custom stuff (breaking other players). So the break is already happening in this world... reply WesleyLivesay 18 hours agorootparentInteresting...in a bad way. I guess I am not shocked that they would do something like that.

That said, they allow distributors to opt into \"Passthrough\" MP3 delivery to all modern devices (including browsers – just check the network tab in developer tools!), although it's not the default. reply thehappypm 16 hours agorootparentprevSecurity and performance come to mind. If they just served podcasts directly from third parties, third parties would be able at least in theory to push potentially malicious data to the Spotify app (and Spotify users' devices).

Firewire was a critical piece of why the iPod was actually good, because it provided fast transfer rates for syncing lots of audio, and higher power for faster charging. USB 2 was comparable, but still quite new and not present on most computers that people already owned at the time. While iTunes was required, it was free and there was no subscription or limitation on what you could sync to the device.

Feed burner tried. Spotify tried. I think podcasting is like blogs or email newsletters. There may be value in centralization (dev.to, medium, etc for blogs, MailChimp, substack, etc for newsletters) but there'll always be a space for you to own and run it yourself. Critically, you can port your subscribers in each of these cases, unlike subscribers to a YouTube channel or a Facebook group. I think thats a correlary of Anil's point. It isn't enough for discovery to be open, you, the creator, need to own the means of distribution. I read other comments about 'forever redirects' of the RSS feed if you leave a podcast platform and they're a bit worrisome, but I wonder if a year or two of redirect service would be adequate.

Still safer to set up a reverse proxy under a domain you control. reply colinsane 13 hours agoparentprevcritically, even Substack still exposes their RSS feeds publicly. view it as a two-sided marketplace: Substack would need to control both a majority of feed sources and a majority of feed consumption (i.e. the install base of feed readers) to escape RSS. ditto with the podcasting space. or at least, so is the theory. but i see that most of the shows i listen to aren't available when i search them in Spotify. so i'm not sure how Spotify users interact with podcasts: do they use multiple podcast apps? does Spotify win only those users who previously weren't listening to podcasts (and so don't lose access to anything they valued when moving to Spotify for podcasts)? reply postepowanieadm 22 hours agoparentprevMonetization is a problem, centralization is a flawed solution. reply jcutrell 19 hours agoparentprevI think the mp3 is responsible for much of the positive momentum of podcasts and audio in general. (That's pretty obvious.) But there is not a widely accepted analog in video. Video encoding is complicated. And since we are at a particular juncture where video is large enough relative to internet speed, compression and encoding are still very important. So the complexity of that is what makes it hard to go totally open in my opinion, at least from the creator standpoint. That and the fact that there is just too much momentum with YouTube's audience volume, if your goal is viewership. reply cruffle_duffle 17 hours agorootparentVideo also has the twist that, unlike audio, it has to support a bunch of different hardware configurations. You’ve got to support multiple video codecs, multiple resolutions and bitrates. And to be good you might even be serving several of those variants to the same client in one viewing—which means you have to intelligently chop up the video into smaller pieces. Plus the supporting client side tooling is more important—for example those little thumbnails that show up while seeking through a clip. Audio is easy. Throw up an mp3 and you are done. The basic fundamentals of an audio client have remained largely unchanged since the invention of the tape deck. Video is a while different animal. That being said, moving to an RSS based model for video would be pretty interesting.

It can be observed that they’re centralized when media companies make exclusive deals as Spotify attempted with JRE. reply jdauriemma 12 hours agorootparentApologies, I’m probably missing some nuance but I don’t see anything in your reply that is meaningfully different from the comment above. The existence of major platforms does not necessarily challenge the notion that podcasting is open by design. The advent of exclusivity deals seems to confirm the standing assumption that podcasters are in control of distribution. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 6 hours agorootparentAh yeah, I didn’t explain the point well. I wouldn’t disagree that podcasters are in control of distribution; that’s not actually exclusive with the distribution being centralized. The point I was making about the exclusivity deals is just that these platforms have started to try -- and likely will continue to try -- to entice some of the more popular productions into such deals, which would necessarily increase centralization if they go through. It’s a cynical perspective so maybe best kept to myself but I see all the right pieces for a UX bait-and-switch. I suspect the parent commenter (to whom you asked the initial question) sees the same thing. I think it’s seemingly intentionally misleading to call this decentralized; like “that’s what they want you to think” as a paranoid way of putting it. Regardless of any motives, it seems to serve certain interests that this is seen as decentralized, and I don’t think they’re the interests of podcast fans. Food for thought, I guess. reply skywhopper 21 hours agorootparentprevBut you can get 99% of the same podcasts via Apple as you can via Spotify or many other podcasting apps.

They bought his regular anti-intellectual dribble not because podcasts aren't decentralised, but the opposite: because the inexplicable draw of his particular brand of common-sense-insulting prole-feed might convince people that podcasts are something only big services can do, and to compete with other big services trying to do the same things. They want to give the impression that big content is \"locked up\" by services, when it's not.

But Apple, at least, also offers online PURCHASE of DRM-free audio files. I dunno who else still does (Amazon?), but I don't think any of those vendors are still trying to do DRM or lock-in for purchased music. It's just that, by and large, the mass market has moved to the streaming model instead of the purchased-music model. reply zerocrates 12 hours agorootparentAmazon still does, there's Bandcamp, and you still see individual bands and some labels just selling downloads directly. I don't know of anybody who's selling anything DRM-encumbered for download. Google was still selling MP3s not that long ago but they no longer do since they killed Google Play Music. Amazon also sometimes really nudges you to their subscription and you have to do some clicking around to find a way to buy instead. reply hombre_fatal 14 hours agoprevOn the other hand, \"Wherever you get your podcasts\" could already exist because there are \"podcatcher\" clients, not inherently due to centralization away from RSS. It exists even if all podcasts use RSS and all podcast clients are open source and only consume RSS. As soon as podcatchers offer the UX of being able to search for podcasts in the application instead of hunting down and pasting RSS URLs, then it makes sense to say \"Wherever you get your podcasts\" which means \"Just search for our title in your favorite podcast app\" which is what 99% of people want to do including myself rather than manage URLs. It's basically the same as how, in the hey day of RSS, websites would show a bunch of RSS client icons to indicate \"Yes, consume our feed in any of these popular RSS apps\".

I’m a little bit torn. I love good minimal markup and have a soft spot for the idea of RDFa. An early 2000s idealist. But the real world is different. Netscape’s original RSS came out of a clear need: the markup for table layout of the late 90s was shit and not generally parsable. Which is the same thing today: Today’s markup a wastelands of nested divs which are not generally parsable and often generated by tools nobody really has control over.

Although you ultimately raise a good point. Most browsers do support PDF. That's the wide attempt to be something other than a web browser that I was forgetting about earlier. So, there you go, there is precedence. Although there is still that pesky problem of most people not wanting to use RSS. Apple had good in-browser support for RSS there for a while but they found nobody used it. If Apple can't convince Average Joe to use something, it isn't likely anyone can.

While i despise exposure to advertising, I find myself not minding podcast adverts quite as much. There is also a much greater chance that the podcaster will only accept ads that their audience would be plausibly interested in and that are not outright scams (contrasting greatly with big tech-controlled ads). On top of this, you can still simply just skip the ads if you want by fast-forwarding. I think that the key to this model working is that the podcasters are not (necessarily) reliant on big tech. On twitch and youtube streams for instance, algorithmic ads are used mainly to reimburse amazon/google for their hosting services (+ a significant profit). Since a podcast is small in size and does not need to be streamed on-demand, hosting costs are negligible. It seems like this model could also be effective for websites, but it requires an actual human to find and vet advertisers.

The media giant will work with the Fortnite gaming studio on new games and an entertainment universe. Disney has previously collaborated with Epic to bring characters from Marvel, Star Wars, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" \"Tron\" and more to Fortnite. In this article DIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Rafael HenriqueLightrocketGetty Images Disney is investing $1.5 billion for a stake in Epic Games, CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday, in its biggest bet yet on the gaming space. The media giant will work with the Fortnite studio to create new games and an entertainment universe where consumers can \"play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more,\" Disney said in a press release. Disney did not say what the valuation of Epic, a private company, would be after the media company's funding. WATCH NOW VIDEO01:04 Disney CEO Bob Iger: Disney entering into a strategic partnership with Epic Games In an interview with CNBC's Julia Boorstin, Iger called the investment \"probably our biggest foray into the game space ever.\" \"Which I think is not only timely, but an important step when you look at the demographic trends and where Gen Alpha and Gen Z and even millennials are spending their time and media,\" he said. The partnership comes after Disney had success licensing figures such as Spider-Man for blockbuster video games, and collaborated with Epic to bring characters from Marvel, Star Wars, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" \"Tron\" and more to Fortnite. The deal also extends a string of major partnerships for Epic. Fortnite has recently collaborated with Lego for a survival crafting game within the gaming platform similar to Minecraft. It also launched Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game from Harmonix, which created the game Rock Band. \"Disney was one of the first companies to believe in the potential of bringing their worlds together with ours in Fortnite, and they use Unreal Engine across their portfolio,\" said Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney in a statement. \"Now we're collaborating on something entirely new to build a persistent, open and interoperable ecosystem that will bring together the Disney and Fortnite communities.\" Aside from Fortnite, Epic Games is well-known for challenging Apple and Google in court to force them to lower their app store fees. Sweeney was personally involved in both challenges, from the planning stages to testifying in court. He won a victory against Google, although that decision is expected to be appealed, and mostly lost against Apple. — CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

    "commentBody": "Disney to take $1.5B stake in Epic Games (cnbc.com)401 points by sp3n 12 hours agohidepastfavorite278 comments gamepsys 10 hours agoDisney gets more IP in front of more 13-25 year olds. This is a very impressionable age group, and can create life long fans. This is a good value proposition for Disney. Epic probably gets an increase in valuation -- lifeblood for tech companies. Collaboration skins are massive for revenue. However, I'm concerned this relationship will force uncool collaborations with Fortnite and reduce it's appeal. Disney has had some flops recently. Long term the trick for Fortnite is to become the most sticky online videogame in history, with most games bleeding audience over time. Epic is more than just Fortnite, but I imagine this deal is entirely about Fortnite. reply resolutebat 10 hours agoparentMy kids already think many recent Fortnite collabs (Star Wars, Marvel, etc) are lame. Hasn't stopped them from playing though. https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/every-fortnite-collab-cross... reply sublinear 10 hours agorootparentI had the same reaction 20 years ago to Kingdom Hearts. Disney is definitely at risk of becoming irrelevant with their stale IP. reply kmeisthax 6 hours agorootparentThe thing about Kingdom Hearts is you assume it's a vapid Disney corporate tie-in, but then you play it and realize it's actually a vapid Square Enix corporate tie-in. That's the actual draw for Kingdom Hearts fans: an absolutely incomprehensible mess of a plot[0] that just so happens to use a shitton of Disney and Final Fantasy characters. [0] \"Simple and clean is the way it should be...\" reply teeray 6 hours agorootparentNever got to play it, but I always loved “Simple and Clean.” Sounds like I got the best experience of the game. reply NetOpWibby 6 hours agorootparentprevTying in the lyrics was an excellent touch reply mckn1ght 2 hours agorootparentprevSame reaction here with Magic: the Gathering, and all their collabs (Marvel is on the horizon-ugh) but still enjoy playing the game. And they’re apparently single-handedly keeping Hasbro afloat. Funny enough Disney also recently launched their own TCG: Lorcana. A whole new way to leverage that IP! reply slater- 18 minutes agorootparentI’m gonna make a deck that’s just Mountains and Spider-Mans reply totetsu 9 hours agorootparentprevWhen kingdom hearts was released I got my first glimpse of how some people seem to throw their logic and taste out the window for Disney. It just seemed the dumbest thing to me. And why was the sword a key.. [edit: this was my teenage selfs opinion] reply johnnyanmac 9 hours agorootparent>And why was the sword a key. surprisingly one of the simpler questions to answer. The Keyblade is the key that can open (or close) any door. And that was the theme of the first Kingdom Hearts: doors. the big villians plan is to destroy all worlds by opening the door to the Dark World and flooding the existing Light dimension with hoards of monsters. you also spend a lot of time closing off the doors to the heart of the world to protect their cores (monsters destroy core = destroyed world). In addition to bashing enemies and being a large narrative hook, it's a nifty explanation for why you are able to simply tap on a chest and open anything you want. Or break and enter into a bunch of buildings (although the game forgets constantly that it can do that). reply SllX 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause it was a really fun action RPG with camera control issues, that then got fixed in Kingdom Hearts II (actually sooner with Final Mix Plus I think but most people weren’t importing that). It started life as a collab, and it took on an identity of its own almost from your first moment in the game. I literally don’t have a conception of what Donald or Goofy are like outside of Kingdom Hearts anymore, well except for Donald’s contribution to the Ducking Hardcore Mix of It’s a Small World. IP don’t make the game. The game makes the game. reply ethbr1 9 hours agorootparentprevSome people like goofy mashup fun. There's a ton of people who apparently really liked Kingdom Hearts. It's pretty elitist to consider some IP too sacred to remix. reply tombert 9 hours agorootparentI only played Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 on the Playstation 2 as a teenager, and I did enjoy them while playing, but I have to admit that I have absolutely no idea what the hell happened story-wise by the end of the second game. The story just got increasingly convoluted and harder to follow, and the juxtaposition of serious Final Fantasy characters and Disney characters never really stopped being funny to me. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 7 hours agorootparent100% agreed on the story. There’s a recap video that’s probably not too hard to find on youtube which takes 30 minutes to explain the story up to the start of KH3 and I remember a predictable amount of it. There’s also this gem: https://youtube.com/watch?v=fCWjSOSWiUw I only know enough about what “Aqua got ‘Norted” means to put an apostrophe in front of ‘Norted. (Xehanort possesses people or whatever.) I also literally never saw Aqua in any game I played before KH3, except maybe as an extra I didn’t notice. reply aidenn0 9 hours agorootparentprevI didn't play KH for the story; it was just a fun ARPG. I couldn't tell you the plot to the Mana games either, and they had some ridiculous stuff too (traveling by cannon?) reply hoseja 1 hour agorootparentprevDoes it feature Jesus of Nazareth? reply jvanderbot 9 hours agorootparentprevEveryone in my friend group considered it a runaway hit. They all played a ton. I was amazed. reply justech 8 hours agorootparentprev> goofy mashup fun Heh, not sure if pun intended but this made me giggle reply HideousKojima 9 hours agorootparentprevThe first KH was fun I guess. And the combat mechanics Square made for KH are now the standard in Final Fantasy. But the story of KH went completely off the rails in all the sequels and spinoffs and I don't understand how anyone still cares about the story anymore. reply birracerveza 2 hours agorootparentprevKH is a beautiful mess that makes absolutely no sense at all, from the idea to the execution, a complete fever dream that is somehow a very enjoyable experience, but only if you embrace the silliness of it all. If you're a teenager that may be much easier... or much harder, in cases such as yours. reply n6242 9 hours agorootparentprevTo me at least, I liked Kingdom Hearts as a kid despite the Disney stuff, not thanks to it. I played it after Final Fantasy IX and X so I really enjoyed the change from turn-based combat. reply SilasX 7 hours agorootparentprevCynical answer: a big key is less scary to the soccer moms buying this stuff for their kids (than a sword). reply duxup 7 hours agorootparentprevI was a bit mystified by the appeal of kingdom of hearts too… but the fans I knew loved it so they must have done something right. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 7 hours agorootparentI’m not a disney fan but I enjoyed those games. They’re just good action RPGs with fresh advancement bonuses. Very Square Enix, which makes sense, of course. KH3 also made me realize that they can start to target child and adult fans via recently popular titles (e.g. Frozen) and ~30 years ago popular titles (e.g. Toy Story), respectively. reply StevenXC 6 hours agorootparentFrozen (2013), i.e. 11 years ago reply tomcam 8 hours agorootparentprevAt risk? They haven’t had hit movie for years. They have destroyed just about everything they’ve touched, from Indiana Jones to Star Wars to Snow White. reply Benjamin_Dobell 7 hours agorootparentFrozen is one of the newest entries out of any media franchise to gross more than $10B — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media.... More than Fortnite has grossed. Not too shabby. reply jasomill 7 hours agorootparentAccording to that page, Frozen merchandise alone has grossed nearly as much in ten years as the entire Star Trek franchise in almost sixty. Presumably not adjusted for inflation, but still impressive. reply yellowapple 5 hours agorootparentprevI didn't know Pokémon is the single highest-grossing franchise. That's wild and kinda unexpected given its age relative to Mickey Mouse & Friends in 2nd. reply herbst 1 hour agorootparentprevI was surprised to see how much they spend for their movies. We talk about billion dollars and more they put into a single movie. reply jtuple 7 hours agorootparentprevFortnite generated $5.5B in 2023 alone and is estimated at over $20B in lifetime revenue reply chrismcb 7 hours agorootparentprevFrozen came out ten years ago and frozen 2 came out five years ago. I think that qualifies as a few years. Granted life has been tough on the movies since some odd event in 2020 reply Benjamin_Dobell 7 hours agorootparentIt's relative. No-one else has produced a media franchise that earns as much or more than Disney any more recently. Disney has also produced some of the most recent highest grossing box office films https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films. Again, this is relative. We've just had a pandemic followed by writers and actors guild strikes. reply nirvdrum 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you take \"for years\" to literally mean \"more than one year\", sure. I think it's colloquially understood to be far longer than that. \"Encanto\" came out in 2021 and I'd consider that a hit. The soundtrack saw wide play, everyone I know who's seen it loves it, and they're merchandising the hell out of it. To be fair, I saw \"Wish\" with my family and we all enjoyed it, but it obviously didn't come close to \"Frozen 2\" numbers. They're not all hits. With animated film taking years to produce, those perhaps aren't the metric to use. It'll be another few years before the next major animated film by Disney is released. The Marvel movies release more frequently and seem to print money. \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3\" came out last year and has done $845MM¹. ¹ -- https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2977202945/ reply wnevets 7 hours agorootparentprev> They haven’t had hit movie for years. are we really gonna make up things that are easily disprovable? reply michael_nielsen 7 hours agorootparentprevI flagged this - it seems too clearly flame bait. If it was an honest mistake, my apologies. Disney had three movies in 2023 which took more than $200 million at the US box office reply tomcam 6 hours agorootparentThey were all flops. They cost massively more to film and to market than that. And remember theater owners get half of the gross. reply lukan 1 hour agorootparentAs much as I despised for example the first new Star Wars, The Force Awakens: \"The film grossed $2.07 billion worldwide, breaking various box office records and becoming the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film at the time of its release\" reply paganel 1 hour agorootparentprevStar Wars is destroyed beyond redemption by now, and the same goes for Indiana Jones. Pixar is also on a downwards trajectory, and whoever says otherwise is deluding himself/herself. reply chrismcb 7 hours agorootparentprevAnd how much did those movies cost to make? I think the movies you are referring to were expecting to make 500m or more. They needed to make about 500 to break even! Disney said have some successes last year. But they aren't as impressive as you might think reply gen220 6 hours agorootparentBox Office is not the yardstick disney uses, that's just the first phase of the disney wheel. They make oodles of money in merchandise and theme park content that's based on the same (expensive) IP as the movie. When they don't break even on the movie, they'll generally break even or make money on the IP behind the movie. reply caseysoftware 5 hours agorootparentHere's the problem with that analysis, how do you attribute revenue to a specific movie? Will people attend the theme parks or spend more at them because of [movie X]? It's the same problem you have with streaming. Will people subscribe or stay subscribed to D+ longer because of [movie X]? Until you can answer one or both in a repeatable, predictable way, we can wave our hands and say \"it makes money later!\" or \"it doesn't make money later!\" and neither is provable. One other aspect that we CAN prove: streaming kills DVD sales. That's a revenue stream that is gone and won't be coming back so we have yet another deficit to fill. Until then, Box Office and merchandising are the ONLY numbers that we, analysts, and stockholders can point at where \"You put in $X and got out $Y\" for their movie business. And as of right now, that puts Disney's 2023 numbers deeply negative. reply jl6 1 hour agorootparentprevThat would traditionally be the case, but the merchandising is bombing too, and (anecdata time) I can confirm this through personal observation: 80%-off sales of Star Wars merchandise in a local toy store, and my kids and their circle having a keen sense of which IP they like (unsurprising spoiler: it’s the stuff based on good movies, not the stuff based on bad movies). reply paulddraper 7 hours agorootparentprevBy what metric was Star Wars not a hit movie reply sota4077 7 hours agorootparentprevWell this is just straight up false. Moana was a massive success. Frozen is a monstrous success for them. Star Wars not being a success is objectively false. The Force Awakens is the second best selling Star Wars movie of all time. reply chrismcb 7 hours agorootparentMoana came out almost 8 years ago! The force awakens is even older. I think you are proving the OPs point. reply LarsDu88 4 hours agorootparentAnd they're making a live action one baby! reply yellowapple 5 hours agorootparentprev> They haven’t had hit movie for years. If I had a nickel for every time I've heard someone singing that one song from Encanto I'd be able to buy Disney. reply jjulius 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet they're still incredibly relevant... reply nilamo 7 hours agorootparentprevThey've had several hits over the past few years, what nonsense are you spreading? Encanto and Turning Red are both great reply herbst 1 hour agorootparentWhen a company is spending more to make a movie than they earn with the movie it's no success just a lot of bought buzz reply gamblor956 5 hours agorootparentprevAvatar 2 came out just over a year ago is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. reply giancarlostoro 9 hours agorootparentprevIf instead of buying IP and stealing from public domain works they invested more into creating new IP they could actually make a lot of money. I'm sick of them being allowed to increase their entertainment monopoly on children instead of being told to just create new original works. It's not like they have a shortage of talented people... reply Yodel0914 9 hours agorootparentIt is not possible to steal from the public domain. That's the entire point of it. reply kmeisthax 6 hours agorootparentIt's stealing in the cultural appropriation sense, not the copyright sense. When you create a new work based off a public domain work, you own what you added to that work. If your adaptation happens to be extremely successful, that effectively recopyrights the character, because the version people care about is the one you own. If someone else wants to use the public domain character, they have to aggressively distance their use of that character from yours. Disney spent decades re-imagining Europe's folk tales[0] through his lens. Their movies are the ones people think about when you mention Snow White, Cinderella, Pinocchio, etc. Notably, the visual designs are unique enough to get independent copyright protection. So independent uses of those characters don't look like themselves. This, BTW, is why anyone who wants to renounce copyright over their creative work should opt for CC-BY-SA and not a public domain dedication. Share-alike clauses prevent this sort of gradual appropriation. [0] as filtered/censored thru the Brothers Grimm reply bazoom42 1 hour agorootparentThe material which was public domain is still public domain, Disney did not “re-copyright” anything. Just google how many different versions of Pinocchio has been made independently from Disney. Gulliermo del Toro won an oscar for his version. If you havent seen that it is your own fault, not the fault of Disney or copyright law. Stephen Sondheim had a pretty succesful musical based on Grimms tales. But yeah, if you want people to care about your version, you have to bring something new to the table. reply Yodel0914 4 hours agorootparentprev> It's stealing in the cultural appropriation sense, not the copyright sense. Well, I agree with that. But very likely not for the same reasons you do. reply tanseydavid 8 hours agorootparentprevGo try to produce something based around the public domain story Cinderella. I doubt that Disney would take this kindly or lightly. That's the entire point of the post that you are responding to. reply blackoil 8 hours agorootparenthttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella#Works_based_on_th... reply mynameisvlad 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat public domain works have their recent movies been based off of? Outside of their reimaginings/reboots, I can't think of a single recent movie that isn't an original work. And that doesn't include things like LucasFilm, Marvel and Pixar which are, obviously, original and still part of Disney. reply legostormtroopr 9 hours agorootparentTangled (Repunzel), Moana (uses and remixes actual Polynesian myths), Frozen (based on the snow queen), Peter Pan, Little Mermaid - a stack of recent Disney movies have been based on existing IP. You just don't notice because they culturally steamroll the originals. The most recent movie Wish - is just callbacks to other Disney movies, so does it count as original IP? And this excludes their reboots - but also excludes Pixar which has done some original albeit lacklustre stuff recently. reply mynameisvlad 9 hours agorootparentPeter Pan is a 70-year old movie. Little Mermaid is 25 years old. There have also been many, many original movies released in that time: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures... The vast majority of recent Disney content is original. reply thaumasiotes 6 hours agorootparent> Little Mermaid is 25 years old. You're thinking of Mulan, not The Little Mermaid. reply mynameisvlad 4 hours agorootparentOh god I misread 89 as 99. Even I didn’t realize it was that old. reply selimthegrim 9 hours agorootparentprevAs far as Frozen goes, at least they got something new to replace the Norway exhibit at Epcot, because it got so old and stale, that Norway disowned it, and refused to pay for the renewal reply s1artibartfast 9 hours agorootparentprevIMO, their biggest problem is moving away from public domain works. reply TomK32 2 hours agorootparentprevJust wait until Disney buys Hasbro and watch how bad Magic the Gathering will get then... reply mckn1ght 2 hours agorootparentHaha you beat me to the punch a little bit here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39299416 But they have a competing product… for now? reply hmcdona1 10 hours agoparentprevNo, Disney uses Unreal for their rendered real-time sets.

They have a vested interest in seeing the underlying engine continue to prosper. reply jsheard 10 hours agorootparentThey made a point of highlighting the use of Unreal during the production of Season 1, but then it's completely absent from their discussion of later seasons, instead only referencing an in-house renderer they call Helios. Have they specifically said anywhere that they're still using Unreal Engine? https://www.ilm.com/industrial-light-magic-to-expand-stagecr... This 2021 article mentions that external productions using StageCraft services can choose to use either Unreal or Helios for rendering, so the Unreal integration may still be available for those who want it, but obviously ILM didn't write a brand new renderer for the fun of it.

They're actually expanding their use of it with more virtual sets, mainly because they're now leasing them out a fair bit and need the capacity. reply reactordev 10 hours agorootparentprevThis. Virtual Set Production is almost entirely Unreal engine. Fortnite is just a marketing platform. The real meat is the digital production pipeline that made Mando cool. That enabled Star Trek’s recent series’, and provides a “holodeck” for their just unveiled holo-floor. reply jrockway 10 hours agorootparentI don't think Fortnite is just a marketing platform. They wouldn't have bothered suing Apple and Google over app stores if it were merely a loss leader to remind film execs that Unreal Engine is a thing. reply callalex 9 hours agorootparentWhile I agree with you that Fortnite shouldn’t be considered a loss leader, the strategy behind challenging Apple in court is more nuanced. Epic also operates a rather large software/games store and I am sure they would love to see it grow. reply Hikikomori 9 hours agorootparentprevI mean they have epic games store that competes with steam on windows.

WoW and Counterstrike have large loyal fanbases, but I'd be surprised if the age of the average user didn't increase by around 1 year per year. reply gamepsys 5 hours agorootparentprevI was actually thinking about World of Warcraft when I was thinking about a game that failed to be sticky. World of Warcraft peaked in subscriber count in 2010, and has generally seen steady decline since then. I think the numbers for WoW look worse when you consider how sharply it's share of the video game market has declined. The video game market has ballooned in size while Wow's user base is slowly bleeding out. It's hard to get accurate data, but Fortnite has roughly 100x more users than World of Warcraft. Counterstrike is an even smaller userbase. reply spookie 19 minutes agorootparentHow is Counter Strike small? It has consistently 1.5 million daily players. It's about the same as Fortnite. reply meheleventyone 3 hours agorootparentprevA game that has lasted twenty years as a commercial project has definitely not failed to be sticky! There’s a lot of hope and desire for “forever games” particularly from investors but there is no such thing. They will all have a peak and a steady decline at some stage. Social networks exhibit this pattern as well. reply Reason077 2 hours agorootparentprev> ”World of Warcraft peaked in subscriber count in 2010, and has generally seen steady decline since then.” Sure, but even in 2024 this 20-year old game has a paid monthly player count well into the millions.

But I have been in the game business as a developer/ publisher / whatever for decades and worked for Disney. Disney more then any other company I know of (maybe except EA) has squandered its opportunities and acquisitions in the game space consistently. Disney Interactive has died and been recreated I think three times in my career. If I started to make a list of all the game companies or game adjacent (Maker Studio) I probably would miss a bunch. And none of them worked. Disney has a really strong culture that has not in the past fit well with the video game business. reply KerrAvon 10 hours agorootparentprevOversimplified positivity doesn't capture their perverse intentions.

If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the audio, which includes emphasis that’s not on the page Introduction Adam: I’m Adam Gordon Bell, and this is CoRecursive. How would you build an operating system? My answer is I wouldn’t. First off, I don’t know how. And the second thing is Googling around, the best estimate seems to be that it took around 2,000 developers to build Windows XP in the 2000s. And that’s just if you can trust random Quora answers. Maybe there was even more people. But actually, it is possible to build an operating system from scratch. I’ve found an existence proof. I’ve found Andreas Kling. He created SerenityOS starting from an empty Git repository. And I’m running it right now, and I’m looking at it. There’s a web browser, and there’s Solitaire. It’s like an alternate world version of the Windows 95 that I grew up using, built from scratch. Really from scratch. It looks totally familiar, but somehow different. So today, I find out how he did it, how this is possible. But mainly today, I find out why. Why build an operating system from scratch? And this answer is about addiction and recovery, and about doing something so big that you can sort of reorient your life around it, and kind of come out the other side as a different person. And it all starts in the 2010s when Andreas worked at Apple. So let’s get into it. Apple and Webkit Adam: You hear me through your headphones, right? Andreas: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Adam: Do you have any questions before we start? Andreas: Not really, I guess if my audio is coming through and everything is good on the technical side, then yeah, I’m up for anything. Adam: Andrea’s worked on WebKit, which is what powers Safari. And he first worked remotely for Apple from his native Sweden, where his typical day looked like this: Andreas: Waking up really late, partly because it was comfortable, but also because all of my coworkers would wake up in a different time zone anyway. So it all kind of worked out with my morning sleepiness, and then kind of just obsessively working on WebKit and Safari stuff most of the day. Really just sitting at the computer the whole day. I didn’t have a very multifaceted lifestyle back then. It was all work all the time. And when I had a chance to hang out with other people, I would sort of take a break from work by just drinking and doing drugs. Those were the two mode I had. So workaholism or other isms. Adam: That was working in Sweden, but eventually he went to work in Cupertino, and he lived in San Francisco where his life was very different, but also sort of the same. Andreas: So I would just wake up in the morning in San Francisco and get myself to the last Apple commute bus. I was the leaving. I think it was at 10:00 the morning or something like that. Ride it down to Cupertino, spend the day in the office just working on whatever we were doing at the time. Usually some kind of performance optimization stuff or benchmark tracking. And I would almost always stay until the very end of the day. So I would grab the very last commute bus home to San Francisco and then come home at 10:00 PM. It was a fairly intense lifestyle. But at the time, it just seemed like everything I wanted from life. As far as I was concerned, I was living my childhood dream. Right? Because I wanted to be a programmer, and now I was. And I didn’t do anything but, so surely that must be the dream. Obviously I can see now that it was a very single-minded existence, I guess. I guess it felt at times like I was putting everything else in my life on hold and not really advancing on any other axis other than career. But I guess I told myself that I was living the dream, so there was nothing to fulfill. And that’s how I sort of was able to exist in that state for a while. I mean, I loved working there for the years that I did at first. It was just towards the end that I got a bit disillusioned. I certainly enjoyed the technical excellence of the people there and getting to work on such tightly integrated solutions and systems was really cool. Owning the Stack Adam: One thing he picked up at Apple was a style of development that’s a bit different than what I’m used to. A lot of development today for me seems to be gluing various components together into a working system. But at Apple, everything is in-house. The web browser you use, the system calls you make, maybe even the programming language you use if you’re using Swift. They’re not black boxes, they’re just something made for you by one of your colleagues. You can ask questions, you can make improvements. It’s all just code there in source control. Andreas: I still feel that nobody really does that better than Apple. They control the whole stack, and they really take advantage of that. Especially lately with putting out their own CPUs and everything now as well. That’s been really awesome. And I enjoyed learning from that environment what is really possible if you control more of the stack. Adam: That’s going to be a theme in this episode and of SerenityOS really. Control everything, keep it all in one big place, and build it all in-house. But the other theme is struggling with escalating drinking and drug use. In Cupertino, Andreas was also going to the bar that’s near the Apple campus most nights and using drugs here and there. But that was really nothing new for him. Escalating Drinking and Drug Use Andreas: That was sort of always part of my personality I think. Ever since I was a teenager, I first tried drinking, tried doing drugs. I discovered that I had an endless appetite for them. And when left to my own devices, that’s sort of where I would just naturally drift to. So if there was nothing to keep my attention, I would just end up drinking or end up doing drugs. And I didn’t think too much of it when I was younger because I had this association that it was cool, or that it’s fine, or whatever. Or that it’s not really a problem. I can quit whenever I want, the cliches. And like anybody else, I was totally bought into the cliche of it’s just a casual recreational use, and I can stop whenever. And I think the two things that drove escalation for me was a much larger paycheck after going into big tech, because big tech pays well. And if you have more money, you can buy bigger and more dangerous drugs. And since that was just my natural tendency, that’s something that I started doing. Adam: So what does that mean? Having a drink at lunch, or does that mean keeping cocaine on your desk? I don’t know. Andreas: The latter. Adam: Yeah. Andreas: Yeah. It was more like that. But there was a time when it was just a drink at lunch as well. So I’ve been through the whole spectrum, but I don’t know if I ever really felt like I was doing anything wrong until I got to the point of no return and realizing that this is an unsustainable problem. But as I was making my way down the train, I never really thought that maybe this isn’t good. It’s very strange how that works. But now of course with the benefit of hindsight, I can see it more clearly. But if you had asked me at the time, I would probably have just insisted that is just a recreational thing. And what’s the big deal? Adam: It almost sounds like you’re keeping things a secret from yourself to a certain extent. Andreas: Yeah, for sure. For sure. I think that’s necessary if you are habitually doing things that are hurtful to yourself or to other people. Then the way that you manage sustaining that kind of lifestyle where you habitually hurt people, is that you come up with ways to rationalize it or to turn it into something else, which of course is not true. But you learn to lie to yourself. Adam: During this period of slow escalation, of drug use, Andreas moved back to Sweden and went back to working remote. I’m a big fan of remote work. But honestly, I feel like there are some psychological dangers to it. Isolation and boredom are known mental health risk factors. I feel like that’s one of the things that makes the story important. How do you know when you’ve gone to a bad place? How do you know when you need to get help? A Trip to the Hospital Adam: For Andreas, things got worse before they got better. He grew a bit detached from his teammates because they were on the opposite side of the world. And eventually, he hit a breaking point, and his family confronted him with an important message. Andreas: I was having an unmanageable problem and I was hurting them. And having to face the fact that I’m not just making a mess of my own life, but it affects others. That was sort of the thing that made me wake up, I guess. Because I think part of what made me able to justify it to myself was that the only one who gets hurt is me. But that’s not really true. That’s never really true, unless you live in complete isolation as a hermit somewhere. You always affect the people around you, but I was kind of oblivious to that until they pointed it out to me. That’s when I really started to see it for the first time, really started thinking critically about it. And it wasn’t easy, and it took a long time to actually unravel. It took a long time to understand how far gone it actually was. Adam: Did you immediately know that you had to change things or were you like, “Maybe a bit less cocaine, and I’ll be all right.” Andreas: So I think I had a brief phase of bargaining, I guess, like anybody would. I don’t recall anymore, but it was probably several days where I would just go over the possibilities in my head. Maybe I can just do less, or maybe I can just get better at hiding it, or maybe I can just figure out some way out of this whole thing. But one thing for me was that I had already been hiding these things to the best of my ability. Not just from coworkers, but also from my family. So it was shocking to have this thing that was private suddenly become public, even to my family. I didn’t really know how to deal with that gracefully. So I think I just kind of buckled under the psychological pressure, and I didn’t have the strength to try to come up with a plan to hide it better. Adam: So his family took him to the hospital. Andreas: The hospital basically flagged me as a person in trouble. And I live in Sweden. So once you get flagged by the government, then they will stay on your case. They don’t let you slip through the cracks so much. That’s how I ended up in a rehab program. They have a very, very serious social safety net here, and they follow up on stuff. So once that happened, I was sort of in the system, and I knew that now I have to do this. Adam: One potential problem of going to the hospital for drug abuse is that it’ll end up on your medical record. Will you get a different standard of care from doctors if they think you’re a drug abuser? Will they be concerned about treating you? This was a turning point for Andreas. Andreas: I was sitting in the hospital, and I had to fill out a form where I consented to drug abuse being a sort of a public entry on my permanent medical record. Because they make you decide do you want your future caregivers to have access to this information? That felt like the real crossroads. Like okay, so now I decide does this become part of my permanent identity, or is this something that I will try to shuffle onto the rug? And I decided then to just make it public. And then I thought all right, well that was easy. And at that point, I decided that the only way that I can do this in a way that I would trust myself would be to make it completely public. So I just told everybody and wanted to sort of make it part of my public identity online as well. But of course that took a bit longer to become comfortable with that idea. Rehab Adam: By this time, he had left Apple, and he was staying with his family, and biking back and forth to outpatient rehab each day. It was a 90 day program. Andreas: I guess I felt defeated. That is really I guess how all these 12 step programs start where you admit defeat. That is usually the first up that you have to admit defeat, and that you have lost your ability to manage the situation. And that was really how I felt. So I was sort of a perfect candidate for that type of therapy. But that’s not to say that everything was roses. I mean of course now, I remember the good parts. But there were really rough parts as well. And one of the things that we had to do in rehab was to try to share with each other, all the people that were there, we had to share with each other a detailed account of all the things that we had and all the mistakes that we had made, and ways we had hurt people and so on. And that was tough, making an honest accounting of that. And I don’t know if I would make it today. It would probably include more things than I was comfortable admitting to back then. So it’s an incremental process I think. Adam: Part of this process was going to Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Andreas: One of the most helpful aspects of it, which was really hard to reconcile at first, was meeting a whole bunch of people who had done way worse things than I had. And just meeting people who had murdered somebody, people who had been to prison, or people who had done a hit and run or something like that. All kinds of people that you would never think it when you saw them, but they had this horrible things that they had done in the past. And it was all associated with being under the influence. Adam: I’ve seen these recovery meetings in various movies, Fight Club comes to mind. It was never clear to me how hearing someone else’s tales of debauchery would help you out. But for Andreas, it seemed to work. Andreas: At first, I felt guilty for sort of looking at them and thinking, “At least I’m not as bad as that person.” Over time, I realized that that’s just sort of a healing mechanism. And it was funny because somebody that I had judged in this way, when I initially met them later, ended up telling me that they were really uncomfortable with me because they felt like I was way worse than they were. They were happy to have met me because I made them feel better about their own misdeeds. It just goes to show that it’s a really big cacophony of just people finding comfort in just hearing about the exploits of other people. And I guess using it to orient themselves around what they really are. Because I think when you do a bunch of nonsense let’s call it, it’s hard to be too judgmental of your own nonsense. But when you see other people doing nonsense, it’s much easier to look at that objectively and say, “Well, that’s not good behavior.” And then when you suddenly encounter a lot of these stories of bad behavior, you start to build almost a sense of morality. Once you have that, it’s much easier to eventually relate your own experiences through that sense of morality. That’s something that we talked a lot about in the rehab program that I went to, how addiction leads to a moral bankruptcy basically. And one of the important things to do in rehab and recovery is to help people build a new sense of morality because you have been taking out loans from their morality bank for too long. And they’re just completely bankrupt, right? Adam: Building this new sense of morality and just going to rehab in general, they were a transformational process. But then the 90 days were over. Out of Rehab Andreas: It was really confusing because I was used to waking up at seven and bicycling over to the rehab place. Adam: This is a dangerous time for people in recovery. He only has a couple months of experience with sober living, and it was all big is around rehab. And now he’s on his own, and he can’t fall back into his old patterns, which leaves him a bit lost. Andreas: I was really shocked at first with just how much time there is in a day. Because when you are living in the fast lane so to say, you don’t notice time’s just flying all the time. And normal healthy lifestyle, it’s just a lot of hours in the day. And I really struggled with just coming up with stuff to do. It was a simple existence. I was also trying to get back in touch with family that I had lost contact with a little bit. So I was borrowing handheld video games from my brother for example. And he just gave me this whole bundle of Nintendo DS games. And I found it hard to talk to him because I was so uncomfortable about having had this secret life. But if I could play these games that he lent me, then I could talk to him about those games. And that was sort of a way to start having a conversation again with each other. So I was just going to meetings and then trying to plow through these Nintendo DS games. That was my life at the time. Adam: Andreas also started getting back into programming. Grandfather’s Computer Andreas: I had this old PC that I had made for my grandfather back in 2006, I think. And that was the computer I had access to at this house I was staying. So I would wake up and press the power button on that thing, hope it would boot up one more time. And it was really on its last legs. You had to tilt the computer so that the CPU fan would short circuit the motherboard if you tilted it wrong. So you had to tilt it just right. Adam: That’s awesome. Andreas: I install an old version of Slackware Linux on that thing, sort of era appropriate. I don’t know, Slackware 11 or whatever from 2006, somewhere thereabouts. And I had this pretty slow machine. And then I guess I would just sit at that computer and write random programs until it was time to go to recovery meetings, and then come back and write more programs. Adam: This sober living, it just seemed so different to him. Even programming seemed different. Andreas: It was astonishing how much more I could program in a day when I had no distractions. And I was just really clearheaded. And I felt like I was on the precipice of some serious productivity if I just had something to sink it into. That’s sort of when I started tinkering with some of the low level programming projects, which eventually became the Serenity Operating System. But at first, I was really kind of just experimenting with this feeling of being able to program for hours on end and just enjoying programming again, I guess, for the first time in a long time. Adam: I mean, that totally makes sense. But why was the path there, why was building an operating system the therapeutic path to a new you? Andreas: Well, I don’t know that I originally saw that. But the thing that made me get into the operating system path in the first place was as a child, I wanted to build my own operating system. When I was 10, 11, 12 at that age. And you can even find old Usenet posts from me as a child asking for help writing like a boot loader when I’m a kid. And totally clueless of course, but- Adam: I don’t know how boot loader works right now. Andreas: All right. Well, I guess most people don’t. But yeah, that’s something that I was curious about as a child. And when I came outta rehab, I guess one big thing that I was thinking a lot about was when was the last time that I felt like I was really myself. And I figured it must have been before I got access to alcohol in my life. That was sort of the original Andreas. And to get back to that, I thought okay, well what did I care about before that? And one of the last things I was interested in before is going on this other life path was operating systems. It seemed kind of natural to just give it a go. See okay, what if I tried that again with everything that I’ve learned since then? And I’ve become a capable programmer since then. So what if I just put those skills to use? I have no job. Nobody’s expecting anything from me. I have money to burn for a year. So let’s just go for it and see what happens. And that’s paraphrasing my thought process, but that’s sort of how it happened. It turned out to be very therapeutic. And I think the first thing that made it therapeutic was that it allowed me to actually fill up the entire day with something I found interesting, but seemed well let’s say relatively harmless, right? Compared to what I had been filling my days with for the past decade. There was nobody waiting for me anywhere, which was kind of a luxurious thing, I suppose, when you’re doing something like this. The fact that there’s nobody waiting for you to get back to work. I was just burning through savings at that point. But it seemed like a reasonable thing to do. Certainly in retrospect, I know it was very reasonable. But even at the time, it seemed like if I can get my head in order and maybe build a different type of life, a better life after this, then it doesn’t matter what it costs. I would rather have no money and be completely clearheaded, then have all the money in the world and just be a drugged out zombie for one more day. So that’s what I was doing. Adam: Staying with family worked during rehab, and probably made it easier to stay sober. But Andreas couldn’t live there his whole life, and his family probably their own lives to live. The Summer Cabin Andreas: So I rented a summer cabin, which was really cheap because winter was about to start, and moved out to this little summer cabin village. So it was just me in this little cabin, and nobody else was around. Adam: Did it have heat? Andreas: It had, what’s it called. I had to burn logs fire. So what is that called? A furnace? Adam: Yeah. Or a stove, a wood stove. Andreas: Yeah. Something like that. I had to bring in wood and burn it. Adam: Fireplace? Andreas: Fireplace. Yes. It had a fireplace. Thank you. But that was really nice. So then I just rented that cabin and stayed there, just continuing what been doing. But now in a place by myself and just getting back into the groove of having a life where there isn’t somebody who’s watching over me all the time. Adam: Andreas stayed there for six months, throwing himself into his operating system project. Andreas: In some ways, I recognize that there was a compromise being made here, right? You’re trading one addiction for another. But even the therapist in my rehab program was always telling me that, “If you get addicted to cooking or to hiking, I don’t care. It’s so much better. Go do that. Eventually, you’ll get bored of it and find other things to do. Just don’t get back into the drugs.” So I didn’t worry too much about substituting some really lame addiction. I guess I thought that I’ll just try it for a while as long as it’s fun. Maybe I’ll lose interest and do something else. But turns that I didn’t really lose interest. So it worked out really well. Adam: What were your goals like? Besides just filling out the clock and enjoying this, did you have a direction with your project? Linux Frustrations Andreas: Well, I don’t know that I ever had a real direction with it. But in the beginning, I remember feeling kind of frustrated with finding myself using Linux again and thinking it’s nice to be back on Linux. Everything is snappy. And the developer experience is really great, but I sure do miss having the source code for everything. Adam: This is a fascinating distinction to draw. Linux is open source. Everyone has access to the code. But if you listen to episode 70 with Joey Hess talking about Debian, making changes can be a bureaucratic process. And that’s just for one distribution. There are hundreds of Linux distributions. Even if it’s a one line change, it could take years to get that upstreamed and spread into various Linux distributions. If you listen to episode 67 about Zig, that was one of Andrew’s motivations behind creating Zig. But meanwhile, Andreas has another strategy at Apple. Everything was in one place, and everything was built internally. Andreas: And when you’re in that environment, it’s extremely powerful. So the area that I worked on primarily throughout my stay at Apple was web performance stuff. So Safari and WebKit performance, optimizations, performance work. And that type of work usually requires traversing the stack up and down, right? It’s usually not as simple as, “I just have to make this little fix in the WebKit library itself, and everything is faster.” But we’d frequently had to work on stuff like image decoding libraries, and network working libraries, and whatnot. And just the access to all those layers and having the expert of whatever thing you wanted to know about. The expert was always somewhere in the building or in the adjacent building. And that’s an incredibly powerful thing. If you look at open source software systems, there isn’t really anything quite like it in the Linux world for example. People are so distributed. And there are many great advantages to being distributed, but I’ve also seen some really great advantages to being centralized. Adam: This doesn’t mean working physically centralized this means everything is in a monorepo. Everything’s in a single file system where it’s easy to get access to. Every piece of code for everything that runs on your computer can be opened and changed. So you can make small, little iterative changes in minutes, instead of possibly years of trying to upstream some shared library. Andreas: I remember so much leaving Apple and still having that feeling of, “I can just go and look in the source code of this thing.” And I was using a MacBook when I left Apple. I remember getting really frustrated when I couldn’t bring up the source code for stuff anymore. Because I had come to take it for granted. Right? I think I had a memory leak in QuickLook or whatever it was. I was previewing something in Finder, and it would just leak memory. And I thought I’m just going to dig into this, see what it is. And I just couldn’t anymore. And now I knew how everybody else felt. That really made me think that it’s silly that I can’t have this feeling about the software that I’m using every day, unless I work at Apple. Because I think it would be cool if everybody could have that feeling about the software they use every day without having to work at Apple. The spirit of taking ownership of the whole stack, Apple doesn’t have a monopoly on that mindset. And it’s definitely something that could be replicated elsewhere. Adam: So that was his goal. Although maybe it was too large to even speak, that he could build something like what Mac OS looked like if you were an Apple developer. Where everything was in one place, and in one style, and easy to change. Andreas: I didn’t dare admit it to myself at first because I thought it was almost too grandiose of an idea to try to create an entirely new environment where this exists in open source. I guess I’m a little bit of the belief that if you have a great big idea, the best thing to do is not tell anybody, because it really takes the air out of it. So better to go and try to prototype the idea. And then if something comes out of it, you can show it to people. But at least in my case, whenever I tell people about some idea, I kind of tend to lose interest in the idea. So I just went to work on it instead. Adam: What he’s working on is building an operating system from scratch, literally from scratch starting with a blank file. What many people mean when they talk about operating systems is the kernel, the lowest level part of the operating system, like the Linux kernel. If the software of your computer was a house, the kernel would be like the foundation and maybe the wood framing. Andreas has a much bigger goal in mind though. Building the Whole Operating System Andreas: As far as I’m concerned, an operating system is all the software that comes with your computer. So macOS is an operating system that comes with a kernel, but also with a web browser, and a text editor, and a note-taking application, and all kinds of stuff. Right? And that’s sort of what I think of as an operating system. Not so much the Linux kernel purist idea that the kernel is the operating system. Adam: That’s right. He was going to build it all. He’s not just going to build the foundation and the framing. But he’s going to build the walls, and the carpet, and the stove, and even the pigments for the paint and the coffee maker. This might be where my metaphor starts to break down. Because on a computer, all of those things are just made of one thing: Andreas: Everything is just a piece of code that somebody writes. And if we just make all those pieces of code and stack them up, it’s going to work. I had no illusions about how an operating system looks once it is put together and works. Now I didn’t know how to get there, but I reasoned that if you just start building these components one by one, eventually you’ll have the full stack and it will just gel together. So that’s what I started doing. Learning To Build an OS Adam: How do you learn how to build an operating system? Andreas: Well when I started, I had no idea how to do that. So it was a gradual process for me. I always figured that the hardest part would be choosing which abstractions to use. Because once you know what the abstractions are, it’s just a matter of implementing them. So I decided to make it a little bit easy for myself with Serenity to use existing abstractions or well known abstractions like Unix, right? And instead of coming up with an entirely new style of kernel, I just made a classical Unix kernel. Instead of trying to come up with a radical new UI, just used the late ’90s UI. Adam: By late ’90s UI, Andreas specifically means he’s building an operating system that looks like Windows 2000. The Windows 2000 that he used as an 11 year old kid. Windows 2000 and SynthWave Andreas: Windows 2000 was beautiful. And it knew exactly what it was. And then, everybody got distracted because we had to turn the PC into a gaming machine, into a surfing machine. And it had to become everything. A multimedia entertainment platform. And I had just these positive childhood memories of the really serious office computer. That’s something that I wanted to rebuild I guess. Adam: This idea of recreating the past based on nostalgic joy is something that he learned from the music genre synthwave. Andreas: It’s a modern music genre that takes influence from 1980s synth pop and movie soundtracks like Blade Runner and things like that. And I see this parallel between the genre of synthwave wave and what I’m doing with Serenity in that we are taking all these old ideas, but rebuilding them using modern technology and modern development practices. And it’s so much easier today to build a system that looks and feels like something from the year 2000 than it was back then. Because of course, we have way better stuff today, and we understand much more about software development. Much like with synthwave, it’s so much easier to make a cool synth-pop song today than it was in 1985, because in ‘85 you needed analog synthesizers and all this advanced equipment, right? Or I guess you had digital synthesizers in ‘85, but you had much more crude tools. And in that sense, I think SerenityOS is like synthwave. It’s creating something strongly influenced by the past, but in a modern way, and in a sort of a high fidelity way with 2020 hindsight. Adam: So this is what Andreas was working on all day, every day when he wasn’t attending NA meetings. Just coding away in his cabin, building a new sober life for himself by throwing himself at this project. Announcing the Project To Reddit Andreas: And then when that rental contract ran out, that’s when I made a post on Reddit about, “So I’m moving out of this house, and I just spent the last six months here writing this operating system. And here’s what it looks like.” And had a little demo video of it that I posted on YouTube as well. People were really kind of captivated by the thing I think. Of course looking back now, it’s very simple compared to what it has become. But there was something about it that was really energetic and something new, yet still familiar to everybody. I mean I don’t know. I thought a lot about what is it that makes this so interesting to people? I can never quite figure it out, but people liked it. Adam: One thing I was thinking about is oftentimes, the layers below yourself as a developer seem kind of magical. So for somebody to come along and say, “Here it is. Here’s all of it.” It’s like, “Here, I started at the bottom.” It’s almost like you’re saying, “It’s not magic. Look, here. Did it?” Andreas: Yeah. No, that’s true. That’s true. That’s something I heard often from people. It piqued people’s curiosity who wanted to see what a real system might look like, even though it was clearly immature. It was still an approximation of what a mature system might look like. Adam: Those people whose interest was piqued, they started to poke around with Serenity, try it out. And they started to contribute. Andreas: One of the first things that somebody helped out with was writing a script that would automate the build process. And that was really, really sweet. I was very, very grateful for that. And then since then, it’s just been growing. New people pick this up every week and find something they want to hack on. And I’ve always been welcoming to new people because even if it started as a personal therapy project for me, that doesn’t mean that I don’t want other people to work on it. Right? I’m really happy to share my programming playground with anybody else who wants to write similar type of software. Adam: And to explain how it all worked, Andreas started recording himself. He recorded himself coding, and uploaded it onto YouTube. This didn’t come naturally to him at first. Andreas: One of the first videos I put up on YouTube, I had this long struggle trying to print out a number in octal. And it took me a little too long. And I remember just feeling, “This is so embarrassing. Now everybody will see.” And I decided to upload it anyway because I thought, “You know what? This would probably be good for me if I just become okay with people seeing me struggling with something silly.” Adam: It’s interesting because you had a secret life, and then you went to a world of nothing is secret. Was this some sort of conscious decision to be completely out there with this project? Andreas: I think so. I even named it after the recovery program I was in. When you go to these 12 step meetings, then you always read the Serenity prayer at the end. The way I was thinking at the time was I need to make something that is so big and beautiful, that I will want to stick around. And I can use that as a tool to keep myself honest. If I just name it something that always recalls where it came from, and I tell everybody where it came from. So I guess I sort of saw it as a chance to build this big monument to my own recovery. And then I could never run away from it. And I would feel like such a hypocrite if I would start using drugs again and working on my Serenity Operating System at the same time. Right? So I sort of get this built-in deterrent from that. Building in Public Andreas: There’s no telling what the future holds, of course. But in rehab, we often talked about how people have this tendency to, if you see an opportunity to build a back door into your life, like an escape hatch for yourself, then if you’re not conscious about those things, then you have a tendency to just build those. So I guess here, I was kind of thinking proactively and trying to build whatever the opposite of a back door is. Maybe build a window into my life instead let’s say. Adam: The community started watching through that window. People watched him code and then they asked him questions. How did he type so fast? How did he get started working at Apple? How do you pass a coding interview? He started off a bit nervous. But as the hours of tape accumulated, he became a pretty confident speaker. And people learned a lot watching him code. He was good at what he did. He had to get a job initially to support himself. But eventually, his YouTube fans and project contributors, they gave him enough financial support that he could dedicate to this full time. A neat thing about a project this large is there’s lots of rough edges. There’s lots of parts to build. There’s lots of work to keep many people busy. When I look right now, in past 30 days, Serenity has had over 100 contributors, and the numbers continue to grow. But actually growth and completion, that’s not really what this project is about. Just a Kid who Loved Computers Andreas: Unlike most other projects, we are not trying to gain users, or popularity, or anything like that. Each and every person who works on this, they just want to make something for themselves, something beautiful. And I think that gives us almost kind of a purity of purpose that I enjoy. That I always treated it as this is going to take at least 10 years to get anywhere reasonable. And it’s astonishing how much you can do if you take that perspective from the beginning. If you accept that something is going to take a long time, you don’t have to deal with that growing disappointment when you’re not getting to where you want to be immediately. Adam: My very last question is did you recapture this 11 year old version of yourself and that energy that you were looking for? Andreas: I think so. I’ve never felt more true to myself than I do lately. I never worry anymore about how I present myself if I’m saying the right thing or if I should try to phrase myself this way or that way. Because I can just speak from the heart, and I know that it comes out how I want it to come out. Most of my life, I was very conscious of everything I would say. And I was always trying to manicure my public persona so that I could obscure how I was living my life. And it is a very good feeling to not do that, and to just sort of speak candidly and honestly about everything and anything. And that’s really how I was like when I was 11. I wasn’t cynical, and I wasn’t trying to hide anything. I was just a kid who loved computers. And I think I became that again. And I’m happy about that. Next Steps Adam: You can find Andreas on YouTube. Serenity isn’t done, but you can use it. I don’t think it’s the type of project that will ever be complete. If you want to learn how to build an operating system, or systems programming, or modern C++, or just watch hundreds of hours of a calm person working diligently at a project that he thinks might take all his life, you should totally check him out on YouTube. And as you’ve probably gotten a taste of here, his openness and candor speaking about his life is very endearing. So you should check that out. Also, if you want to hear more about his time at Apple and how it was both an amazing experience and a problematic one, and more about the Serenity project and how it can be transformative for people who join, check out the Patreon episode. It’s going to be out on the 15th. Oh yeah. And we didn’t even cover this, but they’re building a full web browser from scratch. I heard someone say that the web standards are so complex right now, that it wouldn’t be possible to build a new web browser. But here, the Serenity team is doing it. And you can watch them. Adam: If you want to hear that and more like it, please support the podcast on Patreon to unlock those episodes. And until next time, thank you so much for listening.

There's a few things I desperately want an operating system to do: 1. Have either database-like transactions or (at a minimum) write barriers for file operations. The current filesystem semantics are terrible for databases and other applications which need to not corrupt their data after a crash. fsync() is too heavy, because you can't issue subsequent writes while waiting for fsync. Write barriers have better ergonomics (so, less complex, less buggy database implementations). And they're finer grained - so databases can also run much faster. Seriously, I could rant for hours about this. It drives me nuts. 2. Use event queue like semantics for subscriptions. There's dozens of OS APIs in which the OS exposes some data to applications where the data changes over time. Eg, filesystem watching, USB device insertion/removal, Bluetooth, watching a network device, or a socket, or APIs for htop to see the set of active processes. Each of these APIs has an entirely bespoke - and oftentimes idiosyncratic - API to get changes to that data over time. Sometimes you need to poll and parse a file in procfs. Sometimes there's syscall based APIs. And some of the subscription APIs are just broken sometimes, and they'll fail to notify you about changes sometimes. I want to try replacing all of that with a simple, unified API which lets you say \"tell me the state ofand tell me when it changes\". The kernel then replies with the object's current state and I get messages notifying my application about changes. We should be able to use the same API for every type of kernel object. It would also be interesting to try making all userspace programs be wasm bundles and run them in ring0. But I suspect that will run slower on modern hardware compared to using native binaries and context switching. ... Maybe. It might depend on the application. I think this stuff could be done in linux. Event queue style subscriptions would work especially well with io_uring. But I'm kind of excited by the idea of just noodling myself and seeing where I end up. Making stuff is fun. reply Findecanor 19 hours agoparent> I want to try replacing all of that with a simple, unified API which lets you say \"tell me the state ofand tell me when it changes\". Fuchsia's \"Signals\" are designed in that direction. You get a \"handle\" to a resource, and the resource has a 32-bit integer with signal bits that you could subscribe to. The meaning of each bit is different for each type of resource. (In general operating system terminology, \"Signal\" means just a message without any payload that would have required any memory allocation. There are many ways to do it, not just the Unix way. Message ports and other abstractions are sometimes built on top of types of signals) reply dataflow 16 hours agorootparent> In general operating system terminology, \"Signal\" means just a message without any payload that would have required any memory allocation. Do you have a link for this? It's the first time I'm seeing signals described in terms of lack of memory allocation. I always thought the word \"signal\" basically meant user-mode interrupts - asynchronously hijacking a thread. reply josephg 17 hours agorootparentprevOh I didn't know that! Thanks - I'll take a look. reply cbdumas 16 hours agoparentprev> Have either database-like transactions or (at a minimum) write barriers for file operations. Go one step further and have the kernel expose a much more structured view of storage to user space by default. 99.9% of user space programs I've written don't want to deal with file IO, they want a database, or some other way for arbitrary in memory objects to be persisted and shared between processes. There's so much room to improve on the 1970s era IO primitives we use by default. reply didntcheck 15 hours agorootparentIronically my understanding is that several operating systems around that time did do that, then Unix came and said \"a file is just a bag of bytes in a hierarchical namespace\" and we've seemingly never reconsidered reply nerdponx 14 hours agorootparentI can imagine that there's a major lack of flexibility inherent in a record-based filesystem. Nowadays we have file formats that introduce a record format on top of the \"bag of bytes\" for when you want records, but you aren't required to have records of any particular shape and size (or have any records at all) if they don't work for your needs. reply snuxoll 13 hours agorootparentNotable major player here was IBM on the AS/400, you had libraries containing objects of various types (such as PGM/Program, FILE/'file', *DTAQ/Data Queue, etc). 'file' objects were effectively database tables, and even things like source code for programs were stored as such. Eventually IBM added the IFS (integrated file system) to provide a more traditional POSIX-adjacent filesystem that was in fact just a bunch of bits, and it feels weird and out of place with the rest of the system as a result. reply saagarjha 20 hours agoparentprevOne problem with 2. is that subscribing to changes isn't always good enough, since if you go to act on the changes things may update out from under you regardless. Like, if you react to filesystem events, if a new file is created you might have it get deleted before you even register that it was added and do whatever you wanted with it. reply vacuity 20 hours agorootparentI feel like it should be possible to say \"I want to reserve access to this resource when something important happens on it\". Or just \"I want to reserve access to this resource\". Hopefully eliminates TOCTOU races. I guess then there have to be different modes to balance scalability/flexibility. reply electroly 18 hours agorootparentWhen people complain about antivirus and endpoint security applications slowing their computer down, this is what they're talking about. This leads to user-visible delays (which, to them, seem to be random) as the reserver does what it wants right after the user has done something to the file. Many (most? ALL?) apparent Explorer stalls are really Windows Defender locking and scanning the file right after you did something to it. reply duped 15 hours agorootparentIt should be possibly to speculatively execute code that's accessing resources and only allowing transactions on system resources to commit successfully if other transactions haven't invalidated them. Meaning a process could start loading and reading while queuing writes and only writes would block while another process is locking access to the executable to scan it. If the scan succeeds the writes are committed and if it fails it could revoke execution privileges and all the work is undone. Lot of hand waving there, but when you're not committed to existing file system semantics there is a lot of room for innovation. reply josephg 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah good point. I don't want write stalls because of subscription requests. For things like filesystem watching (for compilers), it'd be enough to have a form of snapshot checkpointing. (There were these FS events within 10ms [..]) / (Then the file contents was XXX) / ... (Then there were these FS events) / and so on. Its possible you'd end up in situations where the OS would need to retain old file contents if there's both a pending read from a subscriber and subsequent writes. But in most cases, this is fine. Going back to my original comment, this is the sort of reason I'd like to try this in my own OS kernel rather than try and solve all these problems immediately in linux. It'll give me a chance to try out a few different solutions and see if I can find something that works well. reply saagarjha 19 hours agorootparentprevYou can definitely do that, it just means that userspace can now stall access to things unless you're very careful :) Like, one model (often used by EDR, which is why everyone hates them) is that every operation must be \"authorized\" so it doesn't go through until some evaluation happens. But this means the kernel has to ask a program for every operation, which is slow. reply vacuity 18 hours agorootparentWhat's EDR? But yeah, I recognize that there need to be limits. I haven't really thought it through yet, heh. reply kemotep 17 hours agorootparentEDR stands for Endpoint Detection and Response or Remediation. Think modern antivirus. Less periodic scans and more continuous monitoring for anomalies. reply throw10920 20 hours agoparentprev> It would also be interesting to try making all userspace programs be wasm bundles and run them in ring0. But I suspect that will run slower on modern hardware compared to using native binaries and context switching. If you have all of your programs reside in the same virtual memory space (which is the implication with running them in ring 0), then you get a unique performance advantage in that you don't have to invalidate the TLB. I have no idea how much the amortized performance impact of virtual memory is, unfortunately, so the gains might be trivial, but who knows. reply josephg 17 hours agorootparentYeah - if you run things in the kernel you don't need to do TLB flushes or context switches - which can be very expensive. But thats all offset by the fact that wasm code runs slower inherently, because it needs to bounds checks everywhere. I suspect that programs which make a lot of kernel calls would run faster in the kernel in wasm, and programs that are more compute / memory bound will run faster as native processes. It'd be fun to play around and find where the tradeoffs lie for different applications. reply dhruvrajvanshi 15 hours agorootparentSorry for being daft, but doesn't this imply that TLB is now shared between all processes? Which means that the cost of flushing the TLB is amortized across context switches? Processes are gonna evict TLB entries from other processes at unpredictable intervals. I'm not sure if I understood you correctly. reply josephg 2 hours agorootparentIf all programs run in ring 0, you can just run them all in the same virtual memory space. Then you don’t need TLB flushes at all. Of course, one bad program could bring the whole system down but that’s the price you pay. But if programs were written in wasm, that problem goes away. Wasm prevents bad memory accesses by doing memory protection in software. (Every array or pointer access is bounds checked). reply JohnFen 18 hours agoparentprev> I'm increasingly tempted to try my hand at making a toy OS - or at least a kernel. I strongly encourage you to do this! I think writing your own OS is one of the things every dev should do at least once, just for the educational value. The others are writing a game and writing a compiler and linker. reply actionfromafar 23 hours agoparentprevSome of the issues can be improved \"hackily\" by for instance giving a database software exclusive access to two discrete disks - one for the db file, one for the journal. reply shiroiuma 23 hours agorootparentWhy is this \"hacky\"? I've long wondered why databases need to be on filesystems, other than simply convenience. If you think about it, a filesystem is, itself, basically a database (not a relational one of course). So it seems like you could improve performance a lot by eliminating the filesystem layer and going straight to direct disk access. Also, how this would be done would probably change depending on whether you're using a spinning-rust HD or an SSD, or a RAID array. reply jasode 22 hours agorootparent>I've long wondered why databases need to be on filesystems, other than simply convenience. [...]So it seems like you could improve performance a lot by eliminating the filesystem layer and going straight to direct disk access. Both Oracle RDBMS and older versions of Microsoft SQL Server had the option to use \"raw disk devices\" / \"raw partitions\" instead of the filesystem. It had some obvious justifications such as avoiding the \"wasteful double buffering\" of the file system cache being redundant to the database's cache and avoiding \"unnecessary\" extra i/o abstraction layers. Microsoft later got rid of that option because it wasn't worth the tradeoff of a small performance gain while losing the easier management aspects of NTFS file system. reply user8501 16 hours agorootparentSQLite essentially achieves this as well by keeping the entire database in one file. It’s even faster than the filesystem in some cases: https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html reply bzzzt 22 hours agorootparentprevOracle also had (has?) the capability to split up database volumes on raw disks based on I/O load. reply rkagerer 20 hours agorootparentprevI'd like to go the other way, and have a filesystem that leverages a proper database for its metadata. I can search millions of records in a split second in SQL. But searching records on my hard disk takes enormously more time. The solutions out there for speeding it up (like Windows Indexing service) rely on asynchronous indexing that's patched on top of the filesystem instead of integrated realtime within it, and are subsequently brittle (in my experience), slow down your computer at inconvenient times, and too often aren't instantly up date. Being able to have stored procedures execute when changes trigger would be another interesting aspect that could take the place of event filters and file watchers (especially if critical portions could be configured to happen sequentially & atomically, akin to IRQ handlers). I feel like databases have gotten lots of love over the decades and are super optimized (and by this point are pretty dang reliable). Filesystems feel like they lost their time in the spotlight and have floundered with less innovation. Hardware that calculates CRC's of blocks in realtime would also be awesome (imagine what it would do for sync). The ironic thing is your HDD already does this, there's just no way to tap into that information at the software / filesystem driver level. reply jasode 20 hours agorootparent>I'd like to go the other way, and have a filesystem that leverages a proper database for its metadata. Microsoft made an attempt back in 2003 at creating a \"smarter\" file system with rich metadata based on a real database engine (MS SQL Server) ... but eventually abandoned the project: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS WinFS wasn't necessarily going to completely replace NTFS but Microsoft did have ambitious plans for its integration into everything. It's interesting that other platforms like Unix/Linux/Apple that were designing \"next generation\" file systems like ZFS/ext4/APFS after the failed WinFS project had a chance to try adding their own WinFS smart metadata features to but they didn't. The later fragmentation of user data being spread around in the cloud such as AWS objects, Apple iCloud, Backblaze backups, etc instead of every file saved on home computers makes a \"universal rich metadata index stored in a database engine\" to be a cross-platform standard by all operating systems less realistic today than back in 2003. Therefore, the core os file systems remain a \"dumb blob of bytes\" with a separate layer of metadata index db in vendor-specific schemes like Apple Spotlight db, Windows Search in \".edb\" file, etc. reply didgetmaster 16 hours agorootparentWhen WinFS was canceled, I started my own pet project to build a new kind of file system that totally changed the way file metadata was stored and managed. I built an object based system that could easily handle hundreds of millions of files within a single container (what I called a pod) and do searches much like how you would search a large database table. The 'file table' contains a 64 byte record for each object and has some very unique characteristics that make searches incredibly fast (e.g. it can find all the photos in under a second, even if there are 20 million of them among 200 million files). You can also attach various metadata 'tags' to each object and find matching objects based on them. The project is in open beta and anyone can download it and try it out on their own computer. https://www.didgets.com reply rkagerer 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah they totally missed the mark with WinFS, in my opinion. It was too exotic/foreign with no clear adoption path. All I want is dumb files with something like SQLite replacing or augmenting the allocation table. Then sprinkle on some new capabilities incrementally. reply EvanAnderson 17 hours agorootparentprevYou'd probably enjoy reading about the Be File System: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_File_System It has relational database-like semantics for metadata. reply nvm0n2 17 hours agorootparentprevThe reason indexing services don't work synchronously is because it would cause file IO to get far slower than apps expect, and that can break user interfaces and cause unexpected slow downs. There's also no real reason for it to be synchronous in most cases. reply josephg 22 hours agorootparentprevLots - maybe most - applications need to essentially run their own mini database to store user data. I obviously don't want a partition per application, or per word document. Abstracting away your hard disk is literally the job of your filesystem. reply PeterisP 3 hours agorootparentFor server applications, the trends of virtualization and microservices mean that having \"machine\" dedicated to running a single application is a very common scenario, and also for server VMs running a bunch of apps it is not obvious that having a partition per application is an issue, it would be trivial for the VM initialization scripts to automagically configure a dedicated partition for each DB. Having a OS+filesystem running a virtual OS+filesystem running a database has all kinds of redundant caching, and we could systematically skip a layer here. reply shiroiuma 22 hours agorootparentprevI don't mean that some little SQLite DB for your web browser's storage and settings needs its own partition; that's obviously going too far. I mean for really huge databases, where an entire server is dedicated to running that DB and it has high performance needs. reply josephg 20 hours agorootparentFair enough. But I am including all of those little databases. I agree with you - you could hack around this for a big database by putting it on a dedicated partition (even though you shouldn't need to). But I'm also thinking about applications with little databases that need to live inside the filesystem. They shouldn't need to embed sqlite in order to survive a crash. A different syscall API would allow you to write a small, fast, efficient database engines (like redis or mysql) without needing all of the complex, performance gobbling tricks that these databases currently have. A better filesystem API would help databases everywhere. reply convolvatron 16 hours agorootparentlast time I looked at this, and it was a long time ago, it was around 10% and workload dependent. if you make direct and locking more robust, and allowed an application to turn off the kernel cache, you would only really need to interact with the filesystem after open in order to change your extents. +1. this is clearly a place where we can have nice things and performance reply bakul 12 hours agoparentprev> The current filesystem semantics are terrible for databases There was at least one Unix startup (IIRC it was Tolerant Systems) in mid 80s that applied transactional semantics to filesystem operations. I did some contract work for them and found the performance was absolutely abysmal and the system had some deadlocks. Now may be their implementation was not great but I suspect the converse is also true: database semantics are terrible for filesystems :-) reply josephg 3 hours agorootparentThere was at least one database from the mid 80s with abysmal performance and deadlocks too. But plenty of modern databases are fast and correct. The fact this one startup 40 years ago didn’t solve the problem doesn’t say a lot about whether I’ll be able to. Honestly the fact there are some dead bodies on the mountain makes it more fun to give it a go and see how I do.

Don't worry, there's no danger on that front. I'm pretty thoroughly bored of the \"everything is a file\" motif.

But unix's raw byte streams make a terrible messaging bus. reply sph 22 hours agorootparentYou're on the right path! My area of interest is actually making messaging (a-la-Smalltalk/Erlang) the root idea everything is built upon, rather than the file stream. The file metaphor made sense in the 1960, not in an ultra-networked world of heterogeneous CPUs. IMO, communication should be the basis of computing.

I want a data subscription system, so I can get a kernel object and get a stream of updates which can be applied to the snapshot in sequence. kqueue is very limited in terms of what you can subscribe to, and things like filesystem watching usually requires subsequent filesystem calls to see whats actually changed. And that in turn introduces race conditions if the data is changed again before your fs syscalls make it through. I think there are cleaner APIs out there.

Nobody younger than an older millennial who grew up learning computers via Windows 95 has any interest in “retvrning” to this ethos of computing. Hell, I just described myself and even I could care less about this project other than a passing “huh that’s kinda neat” which is a rather tepid response proportional to the work that has been invested here. There are far more interesting projects rethinking the OS right now that are actually trying their hand at unique architectures. This is just an homage to nostalgia (a technically impressive one, but still nothing inspiring here). The saddest part to me is I’m not sure the graybeards on HN will ever really get that. reply cmrdporcupine 14 hours agorootparentIn the classic definition of .... \"graybeards\"... we have no nostalgia for Win95. Back then we were fighting tooth and nail to undermine MS's monopoly, and Linux as you see it today is the product of that. I will admit the first times I saw the Win95 interface I found it appealing. Though they actually cribbed a lot form the NeXTstep UI, and I'm much more fond of that. I prefer the Sun OpenLook UI for nostalgia value, myself. reply KerrAvon 13 hours agorootparentThe nostalgia for Win95 is sick, honestly. If you want to use a really good unstable mid-90's OS, classic Mac OS is right there. reply PlunderBunny 5 hours agorootparentAs I grow more and more disillusioned with modern computing, I catch myself thinking “just give me macOS classic with a few nice-to-haves bolted on, like a modern browser.” (Yeah, I know those nice-to-haves are probably a lot more work than the rest of the OS). reply cmrdporcupine 5 hours agorootparentYes, well, not crashing all over the place because of lack of memory protection would be nice. I still don't think Apple made the right UI choices in their transition to OS X. Something that looks more like the early Rhapsody copies would be nicer. reply cmrdporcupine 12 hours agorootparentprevWhen I first saw screenshots of Win95 I was impressed at a certain level, from a pure look & feel POV. But there are certain (non)usability things it introduced which I didn't think were great, actually. Window close button next to the minimize and other controls. Classic MacOS did it right by putting it on the far other side of the window where you couldn't accidentally click. The Start menu broke the whole OO metaphor by adding a deep tricky menu system. Right-clicking context menus all over the place. Task bar at the bottom dynamic depending on what is running means hard to use muscle memory and predict where a given tile will be. Overall it was very good for the time. Though in fact I personally think the more 'flat' and minimalistic interface of Windows 3 aged better. This faux-3d bevels etc thing didn't age well. Was a novelty product of the time that NeXT kinda began and everyone followed for a bit. The actual \"operating system\" (really a shell for MS-DOS) in Win95 was terrible. reply rujkking 16 hours agoparentprevYou think a throw back Win 95 clones with UNIX-like internals is what modern users want?

These projects aren't harming you in any way. Who cares what enthusiasts want to do for fun? They're not trying to supplant the OS on your desktop. They're learning something and having fun doing it. I love these sorts of projects. In contrast, many of us treat computers as a magic black box. The abstraction is great for productively building web apps. But, we've lost sight of how things work and I think that's led to steep decline in performance and, perhaps, security. I don't pine for manual resource management in all things, but knowing how syscalls work can help build context on when and why you should use them. Revisiting how to build an OS that isn't rooted in decades-old Linux or BSD code could be really instructive. reply rujkking 11 hours agorootparentMy concern is more so that this project will burn up real resources and be abandoned. You’re highlighting how subjective things can be and I don’t disagree. What isn’t subjective is the generations of the 1900s are the first to leave behind an existential threat driven by wasteful economic choices and they seem to be indifferent to doing so just to have fun. Myself and lot of other software engineers I have worked with feel our jobs are meaningless; the future won’t care about these technologies. They’re hardly regenerative medicine or something so life changing daily life itself is improved forever like indoor plumbing and electricity.

Some rebuild cars. Others 3D print things. Others yet enjoy woodworking. One the grand features of our current society is you're not working 14 hour days, seven days a week in a factory. Without a doubt, there are those working multiple jobs and still struggling to make ends meet. But, fortunately, many are able to work a single job and live a relatively comfortable life. Those that can often have hobbies. It helps them unwind and maybe even enjoy life a little since otherwise so much of it is spent working or sleeping. It's downtime and largely considered positive for mental health and, consequently, one's ability to contribute to society. Most people aren't solving deep societal needs in their free time. If you want to limit it to software, most of us have jobs that hardly improve society or the planet. Most open source code isn't advancing society. What I don't understand is why you've singled out the participants of this particular project for your ire. I don't know any of the individuals involved personally. My guess is they're not the ones that built physical products with PFCs, ran coal-powered factories and operated strip mining operations, designed nuclear weaponry, or even fly personal jets. I'd hazard to say your average front-end developer chugging through batteries with inefficient frameworks is doing more harm than this project. If your aim is to clean up the tech industry, I think that's laudable. I believe tech people have for the most part shirked their own contribution to our carbon footprint or other societal needs. But, I think you'll find there are much bigger targets actively doing harm (or certainly not helping things) regularly because it's profitable and/or convenient. reply vilunov 16 hours agorootparentprevWe haven't improved much since Win 95 in terms of desktop OS UI/UX.

I press a hotkey, type the first few characters of the program I'm trying to go to, and press enter. This is also common in text editors and even some web apps. Improves the UX of discovering commands, as compared to endlessly nested menus like the 90s.

Tabs in browser and other applications. 2. Font rendering, hinting, anti-aliasing and subpixel rendering. Together with high-resolution screens for more people. 3.

OSes today are more than kernels. Filesystems, init systems, shells, and the configuration conventions would all be part of it. And probably also the windowing system and desktop environment. The most innovative concepts historically would be Plan9, BeOS, and seL4. Plan9's approach of \"everything is a file\" is something that was unique. BeOS's extensive use of journalling and metadata in the filesystem gave it big advantages. seL4 being the most rigorous application of a micro-kernel architecture, and making use of formal verification make this one stand out. Capability-based operating systems also offer immense benefits. Fuchsia and Redox are clearly drawing some inspiration from these. Along with GNU Hurd, which you didn't mention. As for shells, nushell is clearly revolutionary. Something that points to what a better world might have been. I would also recommend looking at Lennart Poettering's vision that extends on innovations like cgroups, journalling filesystems, ostree, etc. https://0pointer.net/blog/projects/stateless.html And of course, Nix and Guix both align with this vision of reproducibility, statelessness, and transactionality... along with Fedora Silverblue. I kinda think of this as making the filesystem work more like git. A distro is a branch. A rollback is a branch from a previous commit. And then the build system would be completely idempotent... every compilation from any system would be byte-for-byte identical, and thus verifiable in a security sense. And every upgrade on any system could be undone. reply Ezhik 23 hours agoprev> creating something strongly influenced by the past, but in a modern way, and in a sort of a high fidelity way with 2020 hindsight This is a great take on retrocomputing and tech nostalgia.

I actually came into this thread thinking, \"damn, I have no idea specifically WHAT I would do/not do if I made an OS, or where to even start\" not that I could at all. But I mean feature-wise, etc. Like, it's obviously a ton of apis that you call to invoke things at the system level but I have no idea what to do at the system level. Maybe you just communicate with APIs over there for everything on the motherboard. I know Nvidia has NVAPI I've used that a bunch through their SDK, not more low level. And you start with probably a super baby kernel.. There are also different styles of OS, like windows with the registry which I have broken and fixed thousands of times, and then nix which is pretty much file based. I don't know what else would be better than either of these, I hate the registry thing but maybe it has some huge benefit I haven't figured out. When I look at C I see heiroglypics. Maybe me learning rust is helping with that. I do really need to learn it for security sake and (live)patching, etc. I write go and ruby so I don't touch memory much. I'm the same about filesystems. I know a bunch of them and hve done tons of performance testing for SANs etc but couldn't tell you a thing about the lower level, making one, stuff. edit: lol I guess a lot of this is installing drivers too reply MobiusHorizons 18 hours agorootparentDon’t look at c specifically, look at syscalls. This is the real api of the operating system. It will also be confusing probably, since it is in some senses like thinking about how functions are implemented in assembly, but you don’t have to focus on the mechanics of how they work if that confuses you. One interesting exercise might be thinking about how syscalls are used to make up the standard library functions you are more familiar with. reply Workaccount2 19 hours agorootparentprevI have always found it interesting how people who come from the top down (software -> hardware) get confused by the low level stuff, and myself who came from the bottom up (hardware -> software) gets so confused by non-low-level code. I.e. I have no idea how to write a program for windows, it's totally alien to me and I cannot make sense of the code. reply swozey 18 hours agorootparentPerfect! I've worked with a lot of C kernel security devs and I don't think I've ever seen one of them write something not Cish, like python/ruby/go/etc. So, what exactly happens here - you need to write a kernel in some super fast low level language like C. I THINK The kernel that you write is probably talking to, for instance an Intel/AMD CPU, Motherboard, GPU, etc API to access the hardware. Is this close/wrong? If I made a completely new kernel how do I boot it? Does the kernel have its own API that the BIOS calls? Does the BIOS have anything to do with the kernel but instead something starts Windows and that loads the kernel? I think the kernel mounts/becomes aware of all of the hardware (apis?) potentially by the motherboard telling it what's on it. Does the BIOS just start any C app you point it at and they're just C apps that start the kernel? Maybe it goes through the motherboard for most of it.. Maybe it accesses every piece of hardware directly without an API somehow? This may be stupid questions but hopefully they make sense.. And thanks if you or anyone has input! edit: There's a Boot processing of linux Wiki [1] thats pretty good > After being loaded into RAM, bootloader (also called first-stage bootloader or primary bootloader) will execute to load the second-stage bootloader[2] (also called secondary bootloader).[6] The second-stage bootloader will load the kernel image into memory, decompress and initialize it then pass control to this kernel image.[2] Second-stage bootloader also performs several operation on the system such as system hardware check, mounting the root device, loading the necessary kernel modules,...[2] Finally, the very first user-space process (init process) starts, and other high-level system initializations are performed (which involve with startup scripts).[2] > For each of these stages and components, there are different variations and approaches; for example, GRUB, coreboot or Das U-Boot can be used as bootloaders (historical examples are LILO, SYSLINUX or Loadlin), while the startup scripts can be either traditional init-style, or the system configuration can be performed through modern alternatives such as systemd or Upstart. > The intermediate stage loader (stage1.5, usually core.img) is loaded and executed by the stage1 loader. The second-stage loader (stage2, the /boot/grub/ files) is loaded by the stage1.5 and displays the GRUB startup menu that allows the user to choose an operating system or examine and edit startup parameters. After a menu entry is chosen and optional parameters are given, GRUB loads the linux kernel into memory and passes control to it. GRUB 2 is also capable of chain-loading of another bootloader. In UEFI systems, the stage1 and stage1.5 usually are the same UEFI application file (such as grubx64.efi for x64 UEFI systems). [1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting_process_of_Linux#:~:te....

Programming in low-level languages allow you to think about how, precisely, your memory will be laid out, but on the flip side, they require that you think about memory layouts. If you enjoy thinking about such things, you get used to planning for cache optimization and so on, and moving to python requires actively turning that part of your brain off and taking a „que cera cera\" attitude to any performance consideration lower level than big-O notation. reply Workaccount2 18 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately I have never written low level code for a CPU.

The complexity lies in how far do you want to go with it. While not black-magic, dealing with hardware and its quirks is a different skillset than writing React logic. A bug might need a reboot, or in some rare cases with terrible hardware, turning it into a paperweight. In fact, I believe that learning to write low-level code for simple hardware (say, an Arduino or a RP2040), is a smoother path for a complete newbie than learning the massively complex frontend world, and provides much better foundational knowledge. reply skizm 17 hours agoprevHow does one get started on a toy OS?

Smalltalk is its own operating system, it ran on the 1973 Alto that had 16 core processor and was multitasking. It was the first Graphical User Interface (GUI) that introduced the concept of desktops and window systems to the world. So his observation definitely did not date from before multitasking, GUIs, and window systems and desktops. Smalltalk and its current incarnation Squeak and SqueakNOS (for Squeak No Operating System) is a virtual machine written in a high level programming language that contains everything that we now call an operating system including its device drivers. It runs on bare metal hardware. Alan Kay his research group [2] attempted to make an entire personal computer operating system in just 10.000 lines of high level programming language and demonstrated that it is possible to do [3]. [3] answers the question \"How would you build an operating system?\" from OP. [1] https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08 [2] https://tinlizzie.org/IA/index.php/Papers_from_Viewpoints_Re... [3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY reply astrobe_ 15 hours agorootparentThat was the thinking in the Forth community as well; no absolute frontier between language, library, OS and hardware. But Ingalls was still wrong, because what actually made that recipe work at that time is that they were programming against a predefined hardware, like game consoles. When you program for predefined hardware, an OS is basically a one man-month project (well, in the 80s at least). IIRC 1981 was a bit before the IBM PC, whose selling point was its extensibility. Squeak's VM is exactly a way to come back to predefined hardware. But of course if you get cocky and think you can rid of the OS because your VM is so funtastic, you end up with an inactive project like SqueakNOS. Either because the hardware diversity the OS protected you from hits you like a truck, or because you place strong restrictions on supported hardware - so not everyone who is willing to try it, can actually try it. That's very few people. Its best hope to evolve from the PoC stage is to be paired with some hardware product. Like Forth when it was chosen for the OLPC project. reply CrimsonCape 9 hours agorootparentprevI have a bucket list to jailbreak my iphone and build a ground-up OS that's just a CLI. reply aidenn0 17 hours agorootparentprevHuh?

I would use Linux and its ecosystem as a base. Use a very hackable window manager that allows me to customize the window management and overall experience to my liking.

That's a lot of very high hurdles to clear. Even if this magically solved all my scaling and distributed system problems forever, I'm not sure it'd be worth it. Good luck to them though for being ambitious. reply pchiusano 13 hours agoparentIt definitely is ambitious! A multi-year effort. This post https://www.unison.cloud/our-approach/ talks more about why such radical changes were necessary to achieve what we wanted. (In particular check out the \"3 requirements of the dream\" section, which walks through what the programming language needs to support to be able to do things like \"deploy with a function call.\") My general take on \"when and where to innovate\" is: if you can get a 10x or more improvement in some important dimension by doing things differently, it can absolutely be worth it. This is the philosophy we've applied in developing Unison over the years. I am generally happy to learn something new if I know that I'll be getting something substantial out of it. Of course it can be hard to tell from the outside if the benefits really are worth the changes. I'm not sure what to say about that, other than try it out with something low risk and decide for yourself. Besides the distributed programming / cloud stuff, I'll give a couple other examples where we gain advantages by doing things differently: by storing Unison code in a database, keyed by the hash of that code, we gain a perfect incremental compilation cache which is shared among all developers of a project. This is an absolutely WILD feature, but it's fantastic and hard to go back once you've experienced it. I am basically never waiting around for my code to compile - once code has been parsed and typechecked once, by anyone, it's not touched again until it's changed. This has saved me countless hours compared to other static languages. And I don't have to give up static typing to get this. This sort of content-addressed caching also plays out for testing - for pure tests (which are deterministic), Unison has a test result cache keyed by the hash of the test code. This also saves countless hours - imagine never needing to rerun the same tests over and over when nothing's changed! (And having certainty that the cache invalidation is perfect so you don't need to do a \"clean build just to be sure\") Also replied here re: self-hosting https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39293568 reply mike_d 10 hours agorootparentI think this sums it up: \"a lot of the work you end up doing is not programming.\" Programmers will happily hire a lawyer or a receptionist, but will code themselves into a fury and invent programming languages to avoid admitting they suck at ops and should hire someone.

(e.g., some logic language in a civil law system) reply bloppe 11 hours agorootparentprevNot trying to pour cold water, but the \"3 requirements\" post seems to address straw man problems. There are existing solutions to each problem. 1. \"Deployment should be like calling a function\" isn't that the mantra of serverless? e.g. GCP Cloud Run or AWS Lambda? This is also becoming much more streamlined with server-side WASM e.g. wasmCloud. 2. \"Calling services should be easy\" this is what protobuf is for; cross-language client libraries that handle transport, de-/serialization, native typing, etc. 3. \"typed storage\" isn't this basically an ORM? I suppose it's more general since it doesn't have to be relational, but ORM ideas could just as easily be adapted to JSON blob stores using something like protobuf. Also, storing Unison code in a database, keyed by the hash of that code, sounds a lot like using Bazel with a shared remote cache. I'm not saying Unison isn't cool, but to win me over I'd need you to compare Unison to all these existing technologies and really spell out what differentiates Unison and what makes it better. reply biggestlou 5 hours agorootparentWell, the key difference is that using all those things together is very quickly going to ensnare you in a big pile of goo.

(This is not a knock against Deno, btw, I think it's an awesome project!) > Interesting. Whats it like upgrading and managing dependencies in that code? I'd assume it gets more complex when it's not just the Unison system but 3rd party plugins (stuff interacting with the OS or other libs). In Unison, there's an all-in-one tool we call the Unison Codebase Manager (UCM) which can typecheck and run your code and talk to the code database (we use SQLite for this). The workflow is that you have your text editor / VS code open, and UCM in another terminal, watching for changes. So if you want to edit a definition, say, here's the workflow - 1. `edit blah` brings code into a scratch file, pretty-printed. You make your changes and get that compiling. 2. You type `update` in UCM, and it tries to propagate this change throughout your project. If it can, you're done. If it can't (say because you've changed a type signature), UCM puts the minimum set of definitions in your scratch file. You get this compiling, then do `update` again and you're done. It's quite nice! The scratch files are very ephemeral and not the source of truth. For library dependency upgrades the process is similar: you fetch the new version, then use `upgrade` to say \"I want my project to exclusively use the new version\". If everything's compatible, you're done. If there's incompatible changes, UCM creates a scratch file with the minimum set of things to get compiling. One interesting benefit is you can have multiple versions of the same library in use in your project. Unison doesn't care if you do this (though it can get confusing so people tend to consolidate). But there are cases where we've made good use of the ability to reference multiple \"incompatible\" library versions within a project. reply adastra22 8 hours agorootparentprev> by storing Unison code in a database, keyed by the hash of that code, we gain a perfect incremental compilation cache which is shared among all developers of a project.

Now there's a platform. I often find the best way to understand complex things is to dig all the way back to when they were being thought up. In this case there's a blog post from 2017 that I still find useful when thinking about Unison: https://pchiusano.github.io/2017-01-20/why-not-haskell.html Key quote: Composability is destroyed at program boundaries, therefore extend these boundaries outward, until all the computational resources of civilization are joined in a single planetary-scale computer (With the open sourcing of the language I doubt it will be one computer anymore, but it's an interesting window into the original idea) Personally I find there's a lot to this. It's interesting that we're really, really good at composing code within a program. I can map, filter, loop and do whatever I want to nested data structures with complete type safety to my heart's content. My editor's autocompleting, docs are showing up on hover, it's easy to test, all's well. But as soon as I want cron involved, and maybe a little state-- this is all wrecked. Also deployment gets more annoying as they talk about a lot. So I think Unison always had to have a platform to support bringing this stuff into the language, even though they built the language first. I'd love to hear some opinions from outside Unison about how they like using this language, tooling and hosting. I'd like to hear this too. Also, it would be great if there was something like https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/ or https://todomvc.com/ for platforms that we could use to compare Unison, AWS, etc etc. Or is there already a 7GUIs for platforms that I don't know about? reply jcwilk 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm not associated with Unison Computing and I haven't yet had a chance to use it for a professional project but learning the language and exploring their approach to tooling has been an absolute thrill. I actually found out about Unison because from my own side projects I came to the conclusion that strongly typed, hash-addressed functions were a super compelling approach to highly modular and maintainable programming - especially in the context of LLM-generated code because refactorings and new function generation require very limited context - something desirable for humans but especially for LLMs with limited context. After digging around for something that did this I found Unison and have now mostly abandoned my own tooling because Unison is so much more mature and has such competent people behind the wheel. There is a learning curve for sure, not just with the tooling but also the language. It's a challenging language steeped in advanced software engineering principles, but I would 100% rather spend my time honing my fundamental understanding of my craft rather than learning another 20 AWS tools which are going to go out of style in 12 months. After becoming mildly proficient in Unison I feel like I have such a broader understanding of programming in general even though I've been a full time backend coder for 15+ years. As for the tooling, it does what it needs to and does it well with very competent folks discussing and debating the minutia daily. It's a small team and that keeps them nimble with major improvements taking place each month. Today I'd say that it excels at microservices, things you might otherwise consider a traditional serverless function for, but gives you way more agility and brevity to tweak the application in a surgical and controlled way which is more aligned with the behavior rather than text files. Something just feels very right about storing the AST as-is and manipulating it more directly. Tomorrow, as more supporting libraries get built and interfaces to outside of Unison get developed, anything's possible really - I'm personally certain that we'll see some amount of continued shift towards making ASTs the source of truth so I see learning about it and following the software as an investment in myself and my future capabilities regardless of whether the future software ends up being Unison or something like it. Unison is going out of their way to do all the right things even if it's not always the most practical thing given the current corroded state of web engineering in general, so I'm eager to get in on that as much as possible. reply zawodnaya 13 hours agoparentprevThere is source control on https://share.unison-lang.org/ reply __MatrixMan__ 11 hours agoparentprevIs a language built around a pretty exciting idea.

I was checking out the FAQ for Unison and noticed this: https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/usage-topics/general-faqs/#... > Unison does not currently support a Foreign Function Interface, for invoking code written in other languages. > Your programs can interact with the outside world via the `IO` ability, and this includes interaction via network sockets - so you can interact with code written in other languages if that code can expose a network interface, for example as a web service. We'd like to improve on this position in the future. So far so good, I guess. They're trying to do something that makes sense in the future. They then go on to outline how they're apparently going to expose specific parts of what you might want to use, like `GPU` as an ability/effect...? What do I do when I just want to execute some of my C code and don't want to jump through hoops to do so? I get that this maybe falls apart entirely because of the idea of content-addressable functions, but can't an FFI binding be the hash of its name and inputs and output or something? Maybe I'm misunderstanding their plan with regards to FFI solutions. In the end I'd like to just have something like this with both static and dynamic libraries: ModuleName = foreign import c [libmodule.a, otherlib.so] ModuleName.OpaqueCoolType a = OpaqueCoolType a ModuleName.has : a -> OpaqueCoolType a -> Bool reply 9dev 12 hours agoprevForgive me the heresy, but when I look at this example: helloWorld.deploy : '{IO, Exception} () helloWorld.deploy = Cloud.main do h = sketchy underlinedeployHttp !

I understand the general idea of expanding the scope of programmable code onto the infrastructure layer, that makes total sense to me. But then, you’re just shifting complexity from the developer to your cloud service, and hide it behind a proprietary platform (which I don’t mind, all the best for your business!).

From their written materials, it looks like the thing you’re missing is that this is a single source of truth.

Obviously a lot of us have that all automated, but I don’t know anyone for whom that automation is easy and never needs to be escaped.

There's definitely an overhead to learning a new language but by describing your cloud infrastructure with an actual programming languages you reap the benefits of type-safety, testability, and code reuse, etc. You're spot on with shifting the complexity to the cloud layer; our thought was that it would free up time for dev teams to focus on other layers of their application.

It's a very cool project, https://www.unison.cloud/our-approach/ is a great read, and the Unison language (especially their formulation of effect handlers as \"abilities\") is very cool. There are two specific things here that make me reluctant to use Unison Cloud in my own work: 1. It doesn't look like there's any FFI or way to shell out to other tools within Unison Cloud. I understand that this is necessary to provide the desired static guarantees, but the lack of an escape hatch for using pre-existing code makes this a really hard sell. 2. Typed storage is excellent! What are its performance characteristics? In my experience, gaining expressiveness in storage systems often requires trading away performance because being able to store more kinds of values means we have fewer invariants to enable performance optimizations. How do migrations work? I've always found online migrations to be a major pain point, especially because data rapidly becomes very heavy. (At a glance, it looks like storage is key-value with some DIY indexing primitives, and I couldn't find anything about migration.) The approach article asks \"Why is it so complicated, anyway?\". My guess would be that: 1. For small projects where you can toss together NextJS and SQLite and throw it onto Hetzner, it really _isn't_ that complicated. 2. For large projects where with large amounts of data, high availability requirements, and very large scale, performance and operability matters a lot, and none of these all-in-one systems have yet to demonstrate good performance and operability at scale. 3. There really is not that much demand for projects between these two sizes. reply rlmark 10 hours agoparentNice, a structural editor throwback reference! :-) I'll speak to point 1!

There's also a local single machine interpreter of the cloud API for easy local testing.

Edit: Shorter: do you have type classes reply badelectron 8 hours agoparentShort version: no type classes (yet) Longer version: Building upon what Quekid5 mentioned, Unison abilities are an implementation of what is referred to as algebraic effects in programming language literature. They represent capabilities like IO, state, exceptions, etc. They aren't really a replacement for type classes, though in some cases you can shoehorn abilities in where you might otherwise use a type class. For someone coming from a Haskell background, I think that abilities are closer to a replacement for monad transformers. But in my opinion they are much more ergonomic. Discusson of type classes comes up a lot. Here is a long-standing GitHub issue: https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/issues/502 For what it's worth, I've written Unison quite a lot over the past few years and while I've missed type classes at times, I think that reading unfamiliar code is easier without them.

This sort of \"infrastructure monoculture\" situation gives me the heebie-jeebies, but I'm admittedly pretty dumb when it comes to security. I imagine that with my Google Cloud Run instance running who-knows-what language on maybe some framework, the opportunities to zero in on an exploit are fewer than when an attacker can know exactly what's running, what it's running on, and perhaps even have the ability to enumerate to find instances off of pro plans since they may often use auto-generated names from hyphen-separated common words.

If it's just the hash of its contents, how do you deal with functions which have the same implementation now but shouldn't always - e. g.: serviceA.requiredHeaders key = Dictionary.of \"X-API-KEY\" key serviceB.apiKeyHeader apiKey = Dictionary.of \"X-API-KEY\" apiKey If they hash to the same thing and I update `serviceA.requiredHeaders` (because the vendor changed from `X-API-KEY` to `X-VENDOR-API-KEY`) do I have to know that these are two different services in order to review the change and untangle these two methods or is there a way to mark these as \"structurally equivalent but semantically distinct\"? reply stewoconnor 8 hours agorootparentYes this is unfortunately a problem that comes up with our current system. We had to solve this early on by distinguishing \"unique\" types form \"structural\" types. For types it is obvious that you want to make sure that these types generate a unique hash, even if they are the same structure: type UserName = UserName Text type Password = Password Text since the entire point in introducing types here is to actually declare them as different from one another. But for other it might actually be beneficial to recognize that they are the same type, for example: type Optional a = NoneSome a type Maybe a = NothingJust a To allow for both, you can prefix type with either \"structural\" or \"unique\" depending on what behavior you want (unique is the default). We have tossed around the idea of also introducing unique terms which would let you terms like yours as unique terms that should be salted, and let the current behavior of \"structural\"? terms be the default. The reality is that this hasn't been such a big problem that it has made it to the top of our list yet ;) reply stewoconnor 12 hours agorootparentprevfor us, A and B are the same Term since they have the same hash, they are just two different alias for that hash, so if you update either, you are effectively updating both. In fact if you had the function: double x = x + x and you were to rewrite it to be: double addend = addend + addend Unison would say \"this is the same function, no update needed\" as it produces the same AST reply rlmark 14 hours agoparentprevThat's a great question! (I work for Unison, full disclosure.) The process for upgrading Unison code is that if you have a function A that calls B, and you update B in some way, as long as the change is type-preserving it will automatically be propagated to all the sites in your project where B is called. If the change is not type-preserving (for example, if you added a parameter) the tooling itself will direct you to resolve all the places where B is applied. So as you change code locally, you're continually keeping your codebase in sync; A will always be calling the updated function. Here's an example from our docs: https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/usage-topics/workflow-how-t... reply svieira 14 hours agoparentprevYou update all the callers of B that you can see from your codebase. If `B` is a library then you publish an out-of-band notice that `B` is deprecated and they should switch to `B'`. It's the most extreme form of static linking you can think of (which is really nice for stability, not nice for speed-to-deploy-a-change). reply flying_sheep 11 hours agoprevDistributed function call isn't that simple.

Content-addressed meaning that definitions can be identified with \"a hash of the AST\", which is used as the building block for distributed programming: https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/the-big-idea/ I see the unison.cloud service itself as more of a first large-scale demo of what you can build on that idea (which will hopefully also fund it). But the underlying language is open source and I think could have legs in a bunch of possible applications. reply surprisetalk 15 hours agorootparentThanks!

Is it something like tRPC combined with serverless, but at a language level? reply rlmark 13 hours agoparentI'll give it a shot; I think it's helpful to separate the Unison programming language from the Unison Cloud platform, as they're distinct things even though the features of one (the language) enable and are integrated with the other (the Cloud, which operationalizes the language for web apps and other cloud compute jobs). Unison's core difference is that your code is not stored as regular text files; instead your functions and types are stored as a hash of their AST. This enables nice dependency management workflow and makes things like renaming functions trivial. The thing to remember is that your functions are programmatically tracked. Based on that core difference we built a platform that can deploy those arbitrary hashes (and all their dependencies) to different locations in a cluster, and we created a Unison library so that folks can describe how their code should be shipped across cloud computing resources. So you have Unison code describing and orchestrating Unison services. reply k8svet 11 hours agoprevI feel like my alter ego wrote this same comment a year ago, but if there's any Nix users that are also Unison users, I'd love to hear your thoughts. This feels like some of the tough-but-oh-so-good nature of Nix, applied to general programming. But I haven't had a chance to try Unison much. reply badelectron 7 hours agoparentI use both Unison and Nix (and I work on Unison Cloud). The \"oh-so-good\" aspect that comes from content-addressed dependencies is definitely there. I've spent a lot of time debugging runtime issues on the JVM because two libraries that I depend on disagree on what version of a common dependency should be on my classpath. This is not something you ever experience with Unison. In the runtime every term and type are identified by their hashes, so there's no (realistic) way that names can collide. Otherwise, Unison and Nix feel pretty different to me. Nix is generally a build-time language for arbitrary runtimes, while Unison is a general purpose language for a specific runtime. Nix takes on the really ambitious goal of wrangling ancient projects built with Makefiles and ambient environments into deterministic builds. Through the heroic effort of derivation authors, they've managed to make it work. But it requires those maintainers to do lots of careful manual tracking of dependencies, pre-build source patches, overriding build steps, etc. Unison takes a much more constrained approach: if we start with a language that is content-addressed at its core and keep running with this idea, where do we end up? One nice outcome of this is that you never need to manually track dependency versions, hashes, etc; the language does that for you. The \"tough\" part is also there, but feels different. To me the Nix expression language is straightforward, but I find it difficult to wrap my head around nontrivial derivations. To answer questions like \"what attributes and build steps can/should I override\" I feel like I have to dig through the layers of the implementation. In Unison a powerful static type system and UIs (both local and Unison Share) that support clicking through to any term/type make it easier for me to digest code. The \"tough\" parts of Unison generally stem from the young ecosystem: fewer existing libraries, a codebase manager that is under active development and not nearly as stable as git, etc. If nothing else Unison is worth a try just because it is so different than most other languages/ecosystems. PS if you are interested in usin Nix to install the Unison codebase manager or to package a program written in Unison these repos might be useful (disclaimer I'm ceedubs): https://github.com/ceedubs/unison-nix/ https://github.com/ceedubs/unison-nix-snake/ reply k8svet 7 hours agorootparentDon't have much to say other than I really love and appreciate this answer. This confirms my suspicions that I'm going to like Unison a lot. I get your point, but embracing the \"try to imagine a better world, even if it does mean repackaging every piece of Linux software\" part of Nix makes it easy for me to see that while Unison is different, the re-imagining gets you things you didn't even know you wanted. reply Havoc 11 hours agoprevWhat is the main advantage of this over the classic big cloud function offerings? Sounds like developer experience possibly? reply rlmark 10 hours agoparentThe developer experience would be one of the main advantages. Unison cloud was custom built to run Unison's language without extra steps like building packages, syncing dependencies across nodes, etc. Also, interactions with other cloud platforms typically aren't described in a programming language which is shared between the infrastructure management layer and the application layer. The draw-back is that the Cloud runs the Unison programming language specifically. reply bushwald 7 hours agoprevI'm excited about Unison as a language so I'm glad to see something that will hopefully give it some additional forward momentum reply mhitza 15 hours agoprevI wonder if Unison Cloud is built with the Unison language, that would prove language maturity in my eyes. reply pchiusano 14 hours agoparentYes, it is! Of course there's other technologies involved but the core services for our compute fabric and storage layer are pure Unison[1]. A number of open source libraries in the Unison ecosystem were developed via us eating our own dogfood while developing Unison Cloud. Same with evolution of the language and tooling, which we've continued improving. We have a few things still in Haskell which we'll probably move into Unison eventually.

Seems like a natural fit to me. reply stewoconnor 12 hours agoparentWe recently did a series of blog posts exploring how our remote programming model makes us a good fit for writing distributed map - reduce like programs. https://www.unison-lang.org/articles/distributed-datasets/ One of the real strengths of individual parts of your program being content addressed, and our ability system that lets us track side effects, we can have a programming model where you only need to talk abstractly about where your data is, and how you'd like to operate on it, and then we have the ability to have our cluster gossip about parts of your program that need to be shipped to where parts of your data is. One node can ask another node \"please apply this function to the data you have\" and the other node can gossip to get any missing definitions it needs for that function. You never have to talk about serialization or network connections or software distribution, we know how to move data for you, move code for you, and in some cases even cash partial program results. reply rlmark 12 hours agoparentprevWe wrote an article speaking to this use case here: https://www.unison-lang.org/articles/distributed-datasets/ It's a bit of a deep dive into some of the building blocks of the Remote ecosystem - so it talks quite a bit about how you'd implement something like Spark itself in Unison, but you can see how running data aggregations would work on the Cloud. reply niffydroid 13 hours agoprevI was thinking the UK Union unison when I saw the title reply ildjarn 12 hours agoprevCan Unison code be stored in a Git repo as text? reply rlmark 11 hours agoparentWe used to support git backed codebase hosting a while ago, before we launched our own remote hosting platform https://share.unison-lang.org/ and it had several downsides. 1. Unison terms are stored as hashes so checking in a binary file wasn't very ergonomic and didn't really enable much in terms of collaboration. If we store our code as text on the file system, we have less information than what's tracked in the Unison tooling, since the plain text version isn't aware of its dependencies. 2. Unison's versioning system is more syntactically aware than Git's since its granularity is based on the definition of your functions and types, not incidental changes like whitespace or newlines. You can of course, bring all the Unison code for a program into a text file (you write Unison code in your regular editor) and then check it in, but that's not as nice of a workflow than the one that's supported directly. reply ildjarn 11 hours agorootparentIt might be tough for Unison to be an island outside of GitHub, although I see the benefits. reply rlmark 9 hours agorootparentTotally fair, there are definitely tradeoffs. reply udev4096 3 hours agoprevLooks like just another serverless offering reply VirusNewbie 15 hours agoprevLooks really cool.

But we haven't gotten to it yet.

    "originBody": "ResearchTargeted Threats PAPERWALL Chinese Websites Posing as Local News Outlets Target Global Audiences with Pro-Beijing Content By Alberto Fittarelli February 7, 2024 Key Findings A network of at least 123 websites operated from within the People’s Republic of China while posing as local news outlets in 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Latin America, disseminates pro-Beijing disinformation and ad hominem attacks within much larger volumes of commercial press releases. We name this campaign PAPERWALL. PAPERWALL has similarities with HaiEnergy, an influence operation first reported on in 2022 by the cybersecurity company Mandiant. However, we assess PAPERWALL to be a distinct campaign with different operators and unique techniques, tactics and procedures. PAPERWALL draws significant portions of its content from Times Newswire, a newswire service that was previously linked to HaiEnergy. We found evidence that Times Newswire regularly seeds pro-Beijing political content, including ad hominem attacks, by concealing it within large amounts of seemingly benign commercial content. A central feature of PAPERWALL, observed across the network of websites, is the ephemeral nature of its most aggressive components, whereby articles attacking Beijing’s critics are routinely removed from these websites some time after they are published. We attribute the PAPERWALL campaign to Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd., aka Haimai, a PR firm in China based on digital infrastructure linkages between the firm’s official website and the network. While the campaign’s websites enjoyed negligible exposure to date, there is a heightened risk of inadvertent amplification by the local media and target audiences, as a result of the quick multiplication of these websites and their adaptiveness to local languages and content. These findings confirm the increasingly important role private firms play in the realm of digital influence operations and the propensity of the Chinese government to make use of them. Why Exposing this Type of Campaign Matters Beijing is increasing its aggressive activities in the spheres of influence operations (IOs), both online and offline. In the online realm, relevant to the findings in this report, Chinese IOs are shifting their tactics and increasing their volume of activity. For example, in November 2023 Meta – owner of the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp – announced the removal of five networks engaging in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” (i.e. influence operations) and targeting foreign audiences. Meta noted it as a marked increase in IO activity by China, stating that “for comparison, between 2017 and November 2020, we took down two CIB networks from China, and both mainly focused on the Asia-Pacific region. This represents the most notable change in the threat landscape, when compared with the 2020 [US] election cycle.” Seeding ad hominem attacks on Beijing’s critics can result in particularly harmful consequences for the targeted individuals, especially when, as in PAPERWALL’s case, it happens within much larger amounts of ostensibly benign news or promotional content that lends credibility to and expands the reach of the attacks. The consequences to these individuals can include, but are not limited to, their delegitimization in the country that hosts them; the loss of professional opportunities; and even verbal or physical harassment and intimidation by communities sympathetic to the Chinese government’s agenda. This report adds yet more evidence, to what has been reported by other researchers, of the increasingly important role played by private firms in the management of digital IOs on behalf of the Chinese government. For example, an October 2023 blog post by the RAND corporation summarized recent public findings on this issue, and advocated for the disruption of the disinformation-for-hire industry through the use of sanctions or other available legal and policy means. It should be noted that disinformation-for-hire companies, driven by revenue, not ideology, tend not to be discerning about the motivations of their clients. As major recent press investigations have shown, both their origin and their client base can truly be global. Exposing this actor type, and its tactics, can help understand how governments seek plausible deniability through the hiring of corporate proxies. It can also refocus research on the latter, increasing deterrence by exposing their actions. Background On October 25, 2023, the Italian newspaper Il Foglio published an article, summarized in English here, that exposed a small network of six websites posing as news outlets for Italian audiences that did not correspond to any real newsrooms in Italy. Il Foglio’s investigation confirmed that the websites were not registered as news outlets in the national registry, as legally required for any information organization operating within the country. The identified domains used a specific naming convention: the name of an Italian city in the local spelling (i.e. “Roma”, or “Milano”), followed by mundane terms (for example, “moda”, meaning fashion; “money”; or “journal”). The websites hosted on those domains were all similar in structure, layout, and content, with generic political, crime, and entertainment articles interspersed with a relatively high amount of news related to China, or even directly derived from Chinese news organizations. Il Foglio claimed that the network was being operated from China, and possibly by the Chinese government, based on content analysis and on the six domains resolving to an unspecified IP address owned by Tencent Computer Systems Inc., a major Chinese corporation. The Italian newspaper also hinted at the possible existence of a broader set of websites linked to the six presented, without publicly disclosing further information. On November 13, 2023, the South Korean National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), a governmental agency, also published a report exposing eighteen Korean-language websites posing as local news outlets. The report attributed these sites to a Chinese PR firm called Haimai, based on the firm itself advertising the opportunity for its clients to publish press releases on these same sites. These websites presented strong similarities with the six Italian-language ones exposed by Il Foglio, from their technical structure to the modus operandi utilized. We set out to research the whole network, with the objective of discovering additional websites, their tactics, targeting, and impact; and of verifying the attribution of the activity to its operators. An Extensive Network of Websites The Initial Set Based on DNS infrastructure overlaps, we were able to expand the network identified by Il Foglio to an initial total of 74 domains. The majority of the domains could be identified through a relatively small set of three IP addresses they resolved to. The number of domains hosted on these IP addresses is relatively low: they featured a total of less than 100 domain resolutions, while theoretically, each could have hosted thousands of domains. This could indicate that the IPs are only linked to one operator, rather than multiple clients of the provider. We started from the following six domains, identified in the original news article: DOMAINS italiafinanziarie[.]com napolimoney[.]com romajournal[.]org torinohuman[.]com milanomodaweekly[.]com veneziapost[.]com Table 1: List of 6 domains hosting Italian-language websites as identified by Il Foglio Based on Passive DNS resolution data made available by RiskIQ, we found that the above domains resolved, during the last two years, to at least one of the following three IP addresses: IP OWNED BY FIRST SEEN LAST SEEN 3.12.149[.]243 Amazon Web Services (AWS) 2021-08-14 2023-07-06 162.62.225[.]65 Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited, Shenzhen 2023-07-07 2023-07-08 43.157.63[.]199 Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited, Shenzhen 2023-07-09 2023-10-28 (date of the last check) Table 2: List of IP addresses to which the 6 domains resolved since 2021 We found other domains that had pointed to at least one of those three IP addresses since April 2018, obtaining the following list of 74 domains: alpsbiz[.]com sevillatimes[.]com froneplus[.]com vtnay[.]org guellherald[.]com it[.]euleader[.]org stptb[.]org aksaydaily[.]com benmorning[.]com tarragonapost[.]com veneziapost[.]com conanfinance[.]com ekaterintech[.]com vtnay[.]org cordovapress[.]org cordovapress[.]org londonclup[.]com economyfr[.]com napolimoney[.]com euleader[.]org fftribune[.]com sevillatimes[.]com bmhtoday[.]com ulstergrowth[.]com glasgowtr[.]com kupit-skorost-mdpv-lipeck[.]gaba[.]biz louispress[.]org ulstergrowth[.]com alpsbiz[.]com it[.]wdpp[.]org eiffelpost[.]com kazanculture[.]com volgogradpost[.]com euleader[.]org tarragonapost[.]com bmhtoday[.]com tulunet[.]com samaraindustry[.]com glasgowtr[.]com provencedaily[.]com guellherald[.]com deiniolnews[.]com uk[.]wdpp[.]org doyletimes[.]com fr[.]wdpp[.]org froneplus[.]com italiafinanziarie[.]com fftribune[.]com eiffelpost[.]com milanomodaweekly[.]com gtad2[.]iranianhosting[.]com romajournal[.]org deiniolnews[.]com friendlyparis[.]com britishft[.]com rmtcityfr[.]com findmoscow[.]com britishft[.]com rmtcityfr[.]com conanfinance[.]com economyfr[.]com uk[.]euleader[.]org provencedaily[.]com frnewsfeed[.]com ec2-3-12-149-243[.]us-east-2[.]compute[.]amazonaws[.]com frnewsfeed[.]com friendlyparis[.]com benmorning[.]com [REDACTED] 1 londonclup[.]com doyletimes[.]com torinohuman[.]com gorodbusiness[.]com Table 3: List of 74 domains also resolving to the same 3 IP addresses as the domains identified by Il Foglio We verified that — with only four exceptions, highlighted in table 3 — the domains hosted websites posing as news outlets in several countries. The four highlighted exceptions resolved to one or more of the three examined IP addresses before or after the rest of the network was present on them, making their affiliation to PAPERWALL questionable. Additionally, many of them appeared to utilize the naming convention identified for the Italian-language domains (city name, followed by a generic term). The Broader Network By replicating the same process on the websites highlighted in the NCSC report, we were able to identify additional domains, and confirm them as fully matching the PAPERWALL signature features. These include: The websites’ structure All of them were built on WordPress, and utilized a (highly popular) page builder plugin – WPBakery – for their setup. The domains’ infrastructure As spotted by Il Foglio, the current hosting infrastructure for the six Italian-language domains linked back to Tencent, a Chinese-based company. In fact, the relevant service being utilized is Tencent Cloud; and we could verify that all the currently active domains were being hosted on a Tencent Cloud IP address. It is important however to note that this is something that any private customer can request, provided that certain requirements given by the host provider are satisfied. We confirmed in the Tencent Cloud service documentation that the requirements imposed by the company are minimal: the identity of the individual or company subscribing to the service, a mobile phone number (to be verified through a security code sent via SMS), and a credit or debit card. This effectively means that any private or corporate subscriber operating the network of websites could have pointed their domains to a Tencent IP address by subscribing to their Cloud service. The WordPress users We analyzed the usernames utilized to post content on the PAPERWALL websites through a technique called user enumeration. This technique revealed that the whole network shared a small number of content author names, visible in the table below. USERNAME # OF WEBSITES NOTES Tina 44 European, Asian, Latin American websites Chunqt 28 Asian websites only Sophia 26 European websites only Peter 12 Russian websites only [Others] 11 All eleven users except one were associated with the domain napolimoney[.]com, in a complete departure from the usual pattern. We could not locate evidence that any of those users correspond to an existing person. [Undetermined] 12 Websites whose user list was not accessible; or that were not online (including in an archived version) at the moment of writing this report. Table 4: WordPress usernames identified as used on the PAPERWALL websites The content All of the identified websites had almost identical homepage menus, typically including (translated in the target language): Politics, Economy, Culture, Current Affairs, and Sport. The actual content being posted was a mix of scraped and reposted content from local media in the targeted country; press releases; and occasional Chinese state media articles, or anonymous disinformation content. The content could typically be observed as being simultaneously cross-posted across several of the websites at once. We analyze the content in more detail later in this report. Figure 1: Combo of examples of a commercial press release related to a company called GWM (Great Wall Motor), being posted to six different PAPERWALL websites within the span of six days (25 to 31 October 2023). Note: we did not find any evidence that GWM was aware of its content being promoted as part of a deceptive coordinated campaign. As of December 21, 2023, we were able to identify a total of 123 domains, almost all of which are hosting websites posing as news outlets. A full list of these domains is available in the Appendix. Target Audiences Based on the language utilized, as well as on the sourcing of the local news content reposted by PAPERWALL websites – an aspect that we will also describe in more detail later in this report – we observed the network as mimicking local news outlets in 30 different countries, as shown in the map below. A full list of the target countries, with the number of websites addressing each, is available in the Appendix. Figure 2: Map of the PAPERWALL target audiences, showing the distribution of websites per each country targeted To appear as legitimate local news outlets, PAPERWALL websites typically utilized local references as part of their names. For example, “Eiffel” or “Provence” for French-language websites; “Viking” for the Norwegian one; or city names, commonly used for Italian and Spanish websites. Figure 3: Headers of napolimoney[.]com (Italy), eiffelpost[.]com (France), and sevillatimes[.]com (Spain) shown as examples of the nomenclature pattern used by PAPERWALL A broader look at the domains’ registration timeline shows how the websites were set up in waves, one target country (or region) at a time. In July 2019, updatenews[.]info became the first PAPERWALL domain to be registered. However, due to registration data patterns and archived captures on the Wayback Machine, we can only establish affiliation with PAPERWALL beginning May 2020. The hosted website primarily published news relevant to American readers. Meanwhile, in April 2020, the domain wdpp[.]org (presumably abbreviated for “World Development Press”) was registered. The website located on a Tencent IP address, which is also linked to updatenews[.]info and 16 other PAPERWALL domains, will be critical to our attribution. In July 2020, we saw the first group registrations. That month, nine domains were registered, with each hosting a website aimed at Japanese audiences. One of them, fujiyamatimes[.]com, has a footer linking it to “Updatenews”. Figure 4: Footer on fujiyamatimes[.]com, showing the line “Support: FUJIYAMA TIMES by Updatenews.” The waves immediately following target Korean and again Japanese audiences; beginning in February 2021, the focus moved on to European countries, then in early 2023 to Latin American ones. A summary of the registration waves is shown in the chart below. Figure 5: Timeline of the PAPERWALL domain registrations, with annotation of the target countries for the registered domains on each date The Content Figure 6: Breakdown of the content categories found on the PAPERWALL network of websites Political Content: Targeted Attacks and Disinformation Hidden within much larger amounts of generic content, a smaller portion published by the PAPERWALL network is of a political nature. The following sections break down content types and main features. Targeted Attacks A common type of politically-themed content includes ad hominem attacks, usually kept in English irrespective of the target audience, on figures perceived by Beijing as hostile. For example, an article titled “Yan Limeng is a complete rumor maker” could be found on every active PAPERWALL website as of December 2023. This article contains a direct attack on Li-Meng Yan, a Chinese virologist who alleges that the COVID-19 virus originated from a Chinese government laboratory. While her theories have been widely dismissed by the global scientific community, the attacks on her by PAPERWALL were unsubstantiated, aimed at her personal and professional reputation, and completely anonymous. Figure 7: Examples of an article attacking Li-Meng Yan, as published by the PAPERWALL websites nlpress[.]org (Netherlands), sevillatimes[.]com (Spain), and milanomodaweekly[.]com (Italy) Targeted attacks conducted through PAPERWALL can also take the form of false public pressure campaigns. To continue with the example of Li-Meng Yan, we can observe an attempt at blocking her appointment to an alleged academic role at the Perelman Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania that was circulated by the network in October 2023. Figure 8: Image posted on a PAPERWALL article attacking Li-Meng Yan, and trying to block her alleged appointment to an academic role at the Perelman Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania. The article was posted across the network in October 2023 This article echoes others that circulated outside of the PAPERWALL network on websites that cannot be confirmed as part of the same network, as well as on blogging platforms. For example: “The Perelman School Of Medicine Should Expel Yan Limeng”, published on 16 October 2023 by theinscribermag[.]com. A review of the other articles posted by the same author, “Dawn Wells”, reveals more targeted attacks on political figures, for example the President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen. “Reject Yan Limeng for Perelman Medical College”, published on prlog[.]org, a distinct but equally anonymous press release publishing platform, on 6 March 2022. “This is Yan Limeng was hired as a Perelman School” (sic), published on 21 June 2023 on medium.com, an open blogging platform. “#汉奸闫丽梦#闫丽梦Maintain campus cleanliness Reject Yan Limon for Perelman Medical College”, published on 14 December 2023, also on medium.com. This suggests that PAPERWALL is used as an amplifier for campaigns targeting specific individuals and anonymously employing an array of additional online platforms to maximize their attacks. Conspiracy Theories A second type of politically themed content present within the PAPERWALL network of websites is conspiracy theories, typically aimed at the image of the United States, or its allies. Claims could include, for example, allegations of the US conducting biological experiments on the local population in South-East Asian countries. Figure 9: (Left) Example of conspiracy theory from euleader[.]org. The article was published in an anonymous form directly on the PAPERWALL website, with the feature image hosted on a website called timesnewswire[.]com (right), which we will further analyze in the following section. The image was taken from the cover of a book titled “Biological Weapons: Using Nature to Kill” by Anna Collins Chinese State Media A final category of political content disseminated by PAPERWALL often takes the form of verbatim reposts of content from Chinese state media, such as CGTN or the Global Times. Also, in this case, the content usually remains untranslated from English. An example of this scenario is shown in figure 10. Figure 10: Example of CGTN (Chinese state media) article reposted, verbatim, by the PAPERWALL website italiafinanziarie[.]com on December 13, 2023 Scraping of Local Mainstream Media One of the most evident tactics PAPERWALL employs to disguise its websites as local news outlets is to regularly republish content, verbatim, from legitimate online sources in the target country. Below is an example extracted from the French-language website eiffelpost[.]com: Figure 11: Article posted on eiffelpost[.]com (a confirmed PAPERWALL website), left, and the original published by the real French newspaper Le Parisien, right Each PAPERWALL website has large volumes of content published on a daily basis. For example, we could list a total of 5200 individual URLs published on the website londonclup[.]com, registered in May 2021, by November 10, 2023. A volume of this magnitude points to the possibility that the process was automated. The images in the reposted articles are usually kept as hosted directly on the source website: in the example above, that is https://www.leparisien.fr/. Figure 12: Screenshot of the “Sources” tab in the “Inspect” module of the Chrome browser for eiffelpost[.]com. Highlighted is the folder corresponding to www.leparisien.fr, hosting the original image included in the article on the PAPERWALL website Commercial Content Press Releases Mixed with the copy/pasted news content, the PAPERWALL websites typically publish press releases of a commercial nature. These press releases are often posted either in an explicit “Press Release” section or directly on the homepage. A peculiarity of the press release content is that it is usually not translated in the target language, but remains in the original one – which, for the most part, is English. Figure 13: Dec 15, 2023 screenshot from the homepage of the PAPERWALL website italiafinanziarIe[.]com, showing a press release (in English), mixed with Italian-language legitimate news content (lifted, in this example, from the local news website https://www.rete8.it) Cryptocurrencies A substantial portion of the press release content is specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency topics. This is consistent with the sourcing of press releases from Times Newswire – which we will analyze in the next section – where cryptocurrency topics are among the most common. Figure 14: Snapshot of the Press Release (“Comunicato Stampa” in Italian) section of italiafinanziarie[.]com, showing five distinct cryptocurrency-related press releases, all in English. Again, the Italian language is reserved for the legitimate news content extracted from real local media Content Sourcing In order to better understand the nature and proportion of the sourcing of content by PAPERWALL, we utilized the backlinks analysis platform provided by AHREFS. Backlinks are links created when one website links to another. We extracted all the domains that PAPERWALL backlinked to – therefore including those hosting content published by PAPERWALL – as of November 30, 2023. We sorted them by the amount of total backlinking PAPERWALL domains, in descending order. We then manually reviewed and categorized the backlinked domains. The top 25 ones are visible in figure 15. Figure 15: Our elaboration of the backlinks data obtained through the AHREFS platform, showing the top 25 domains that PAPERWALL websites backlinked to as of November 30, 2023. CGTN and Global Times, both Chinese state media, appear in the list respectively with 95 and 86 backlinking domains each. Note: to emphasize the prominence of the specific topic, we are distinguishing between cryptocurrency-related domains (“Crypto”) and more generic press release clients (“Client Company”). The results show: A top layer of social media domains, which is unsurprising – individual press releases will typically contain links to the client company’s social media profiles; A set of cryptocurrency websites, which – once reviewed individually – are confirmed as the subject of multiple press releases each. Also, two non-crypto private corporations, likely benefiting from the paid press release services that PAPERWALL appears to host; Two Chinese state media websites (CGTN and Global Times), backlinked to by almost 100 domains each; Finally, but crucially, approximately 100 domains backlinked to Times Newswire, a supposed newswire service. Times Newswire Links to PAPERWALL The consistent connection between PAPERWALL and Times Newswire is one of the most peculiar traits of the campaign. While there is certainly no definitive playbook on how online influence operations are conducted, it is uncommon for a network of coordinated websites to regularly draw content from a single publicly available but equally covert source. For example, as seen in other known disinformation campaigns, a typical tactic would be to create copycat domains, mimicking real news sources without revealing where the content was first published. This characteristic makes it possible to analyze the distribution and type of the content and renders the source website a central component of the campaign. As of November 30, 2023, the alleged newswire service was backlinked to by 98 distinct PAPERWALL domains, out of the total 123. We assess that the vast majority of the backlinks in question consist of content directly hosted on the Times Newswire website, and reposted by the PAPERWALL network, as seen in a previous example. Times Newswire is a known entity in the context of influence operations: it was first reported about in 2023 by Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity company. Mandiant observed Times Newswire’s hosted content disseminated through a network of subdomains for legitimate US-based news outlets in the context of an influence campaign that the company dubbed as HaiEnergy. Mandiant had attributed HaiEnergy to a Chinese PR firm called Haixun, previously identified in their original 2022 report; however, in their 2023 report the cybersecurity firm stated: “we currently lack technical evidence to suggest an underlying connection between Haixun and […] Times Newswire, […] and thus currently view them as distinct entities.” In fact, timesnewswire[.]com is – like the PAPERWALL websites – a fully anonymous asset. It should be noted that – unlike the PAPERWALL websites – timesnewswire[.]com offers a “Submit Post” button, hinting at the possibility for registered users to publish content directly to the website. However, once clicked, the button leads to a login page, with no registration module being displayed. The registration of users therefore appears not to happen through the website, and is probably controlled and individually approved by the website’s operators separately. Similarly to what was stated by Mandiant for the HaiEnergy campaign, we cannot currently attribute Times Newswire to the same operators as PAPERWALL. There are however at least two significant similarities between the newswire and the PAPERWALL network: The hosting IP address is also a Tencent one, and on the same AS number (132203) as the PAPERWALL domains. An Autonomous System (AS) number is a collection of IP addresses “under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain.” 43.153.106[.]236, US, Tencent Building Kejizhongyi Avenue, AS132203 Table 5: DNS Resolution of timesnewswire[.]com as of December 21, 2023 Times Newswire also uses a simple WordPress template as its main structure. Additionally, it utilizes the same page builder plugin (WPBakery) used by PAPERWALL. Being central to at least two distinct operations – PAPERWALL and HaiEnergy – Times Newswire could however be an independent asset, simultaneously exploited by multiple influence operations. Ephemerality We were able to identify examples of politically-themed articles that were routinely deleted from Times Newswire. For example, we observed ad hominem attack posts on figures in direct conflict with Beijing’s positions that were later removed from the website. One of these figures was Li Hongzhi, founder and leader of the religious movement Falun Gong, that has been banned and persecuted in mainland China since 1999. While a Google search on the articles mentioning Li Hongzhi currently only returns two articles, a similar search through the Times Newswire content archived by the Wayback Machine showed a total of eight pieces. All articles are anonymous opinion pieces expressing extremely harsh views on Li and the religious movement he leads. This behavior suggests that ephemeral seeding is the intention for most content of that type which is deleted from the source website (Times Newswire) at an unspecified time after its initial publication. As noted in previous research, ephemeral disinformation is designed to elude detection. With the evidence disappearing from the source websites not long after having been published, investigators may be unable to make the necessary connections to detect an influence operation or correctly identify the reach and depth of the operation. At the same time, the seeded message could be picked up and amplified by mainstream or social media, making the narrative stay even if the original source had been removed. In the case of PAPERWALL however, as we discuss in more detail in the Conclusions section, we currently have no evidence that this has ever happened. Figure 16: Headlines of two now-deleted Times Newswire articles (1, 2) attacking Li Hongzhi, founder and leader of the religious movement Falun Gong As a final note on the operational tactics utilized by Times Newswire and, as a consequence, by PAPERWALL, we note that the articles targeting Li Hongzhi, as well as others of a political nature that we could observe, were all categorized as “press releases” on the website, similarly to the thousands of actual promotional posts it published. It is however highly unusual for press releases to include content of this kind. We judge this as another tactic designed to make the political narratives hard to detect without diminishing their potential impact. Attribution: Haimai We attribute PAPERWALL to a PR firm based in China, Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd., or “Haimai.” Haimai was first exposed by the Korean NCSC in their investigation on 18 Korean-focused PAPERWALL websites as being responsible for operating them. However, based on the evidence presented in the NCSC report, that assessment appeared to be primarily based on Haimai itself advertising the paid placement of promotional articles on Times Newswire, and as a consequence, on the PAPERWALL network of websites. We do not consider this criterion as sufficient for a conclusive attribution. In fact, during our research we could identify at least three other PR and marketing companies advertising the sale of promotional packages to be placed directly on PAPERWALL websites. They include: A South Korean firm named Excelsior Partners, which on Kmong (a Korean service marketplace, hosting the advertisement of specialized services by freelancers, or agencies) advertised the sale of language-specific promotional packages. Each of the packages exclusively listed PAPERWALL domains as the “major local media” on which paid editorial content could be placed. A second Korean company called AN&ON, which advertised country-specific promotional packages on its own website in a similar way to Excelsior Partners. The domains listed were, also in this case, PAPERWALL ones. A Chinese company, called Coin Blog, also known as BIBK, equally selling paid editorial content placement on several confirmed PAPERWALL domains. However, we could identify digital infrastructure linkages between Haimai and PAPERWALL. Specifically, the two earliest registered PAPERWALL domains, updatenews[.]info and wdpp[.]org, hosted a Google AdSense ID linking them to Haimai’s official website, hmedium[.]com, and to a second website directly related to it. AdSense IDs are unique identifiers for a website operator’s AdSense account. This is therefore an incriminating finding, proving that both PAPERWALL domains had been set up by the same operators as the Haimai assets. A review of the source code for updatenews[.]info and wdpp[.]org revealed the presence on both websites of the Google AdSense ID ca-pub-5378976189690174. Figure 17: Excerpts of source code from updatenews[.]info (top) and wdpp[.]org (bottom), both displaying the AdSense ID ca-pub-5378976189690174 After conducting a reverse search on this AdSense ID, we could find it on two additional websites: hmedium[.]com and sun-sem[.]com. The former is Haimai’s official website, as reported also by the Korean NCSC; the latter appears to be a secondary website directly connected to hmedium[.]com: it uses the same splash image and text on its homepage, and offers similar promotional services on foreign media. Figure 18: Results of a reverse search for websites using the Google AdSense ID ca-pub-5378976189690174 via DNSlytics, a freely available online tool, showing the two previously identified PAPERWALL websites, as well as the official Haimai website, and a secondary one directly related to it Figure 19: Homepages of Haimai’s official website, hmedium[.]com (left), and of sun-sem[.]com (right) Haimai, short for Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd. (深圳市海卖云享传媒有限公司), is a Shenzhen-based PR and marketing firm, ostensibly established in 2019, according to publicly available records. On its website, the company advertises the sale of promotional placement services in multiple countries and languages. Figure 20: part of the country-focused promotional packages advertised by Haimai on its own official website (automatically translated in Google Chrome) Conclusions PAPERWALL is a large, and fast growing, network of anonymous websites posing as local news outlets while pushing both commercial and political content aligned with Beijing’s views to a variety of European, Asian, and Latin American audiences. The campaign is an example of a sprawling influence operation serving both financial and political interests, and in alignment with Beijing’s political agenda. By observing the minimal traffic towards the network’s websites that is measurable through open source tools 2, and the lack of visible mainstream media coverage (including on news aggregators, such as for example Google News) or social media amplification, we can assess the impact of the campaign as negligible so far. This assessment, however, as well as the large amount of seemingly benign commercial content wrapping the aggressively political one within the PAPERWALL network, should not be taken to indicate that such a campaign is harmless. Seeding pieces of disinformation and targeted attacks within much larger quantities of irrelevant or even unpopular content is a known modus operandi in the context of influence operations, which can eventually pay enormous dividends once one of those fragments is eventually picked up and legitimized by mainstream press or political figures. Finally, the role and prominence of private firms in creating and managing influence operations is hardly news. However, since the early days of research in this space, the disinformation-for-hire industry has boomed, leading to findings and disruptions in countries around the world (for a few examples, in Myanmar, Brazil, the UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia). China – previously exposed for having resorted to this proxy category in large influence operations, including the cited HaiEnergy – is now increasingly benefiting from this operating model, which maintains a thin veil of plausible deniability, while ensuring a broad dissemination of the political messaging. It is safe to assume that PAPERWALL will not be the last example of a partnership between private sector and government in the context of Chinese influence operations.

It turned up this [1] page, and pretty much only that page. But that seems to explain what this probably is. This looks like an amateur hour scam operation. Somebody sets up some sites that look vaguely passable (targeted at an audience who does not even speak the language on the site), auto-populates them with auto-translated Chinese newswire and blog stuff, local scraped stuff, etc. and then claims they're \"major foreign media outlets\", which they then sell access to for the riveting price of just 1.4 million won - about $1000. It looks like a modern take on something like a 419 scam, except I expect they probably do follow through on publishing whatever people submit! Granted not as exciting a discovery as a shadowy influence operation with a super sexy nickname, but probably more accurate. [1] - https://kmong.com/gig/497744 reply bombcar 14 hours agoparentThis is the key to many scams these days - you're not the person being scammed, you're a byproduct or accident.

Spammers selling services to people who don't know what they're doing. reply imiric 16 hours ago [flagged]parentprevnext [10 more] Did you miss the part in the article where these sites contain blatant pro-China propaganda, and ad hominem attacks on CCP political dissidents? I did the same cursory look as you. Go to https://www[.]eiffelpost[.]com/?s=china with a VPN. It shows 24 pages of CGTN greatest hits. How you can interpret this to be anything other than a CCP psyop is beyond me. It's disappointing to see this kind of dismissal on a forum of highly educated people. It's common knowledge that the Chinese government has a history of censoring information that shows them in a bad light, promoting largely false self-aggrandizing narratives, and attacking anyone who challenges them. It shouldn't be surprising at all that the internet outside of their great firewall is a major focus of their operations. Given a lack of direct sources to determine the truth of the situation, I will always lean towards believing that this is part of their established modus operandi, rather than minimizing it by claiming it's just another \"amateur hour scam operation\". reply dang 15 hours agorootparentPlease make your substantive points without swipes, as the site guidelines ask: https://news.ycombinator.com/showhn.html.

I toned it down a bit. reply somenameforme 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you think Chinese news and blogs are full of? reply imiric 16 hours agorootparentThese are not Chinese news and blogs. These sites are created in the language and region of other countries, sometimes by scraping the content of other local sites, and then filling them with the usual Chinese propaganda. Chinese people are not the target audience. reply somenameforme 15 hours agorootparentThe target audience seems to be Koreans who want to market their [whatever] in e.g. France, but neither know French nor anything at all about France. I found the link where you can buy access to the EiffelPost site you mentioned here: https://kmong.com/gig/399972 I assume you didn't check out the link earlier. Basically it's some sort of a Korean craigslist/ebay type site. The site itself is complete legit - Amazon did a case study of them here. [1] The seller/scammer, \"Excelsior Partners\" claims to be affiliated with governments, advertising agencies, and so on. And they guarantee publication in more than 10 \"major French media outlets.\" They even offer to take care of translation for you, with their \"direct partnership with a professional translation agency.\" Heh. Of course those \"major media sites\" are all the ones the article from this thread is talking about. They're just trying to fill out the site with enough junk that somebody who doesn't know the language, doesn't know the locale, and is naive enough to think you can buy guaranteed article placement in multiple major Western publications for $1k, might think it's real. [1] - https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/kmong/ reply imiric 14 hours agorootparentAlright. So the CCP is even lazier and doesn't bother with creating their own sites, but buys access to these branded localized sites, and posts their content that way. Or \"Excelsior Partners\" is just another CCP front, and those kmong listings are a scam in itself. Otherwise, how would you explain 24 pages of CGTN propaganda? In either case, it's a clear link to the CCP. This is no different to what they do on social media as well. They use all established platforms to broaden their reach. reply somenameforme 13 hours agorootparentThe same way I'd explain all the other stuff. It's just lots of filler to try to make the site look, from the scammer's perspective, legit. And you have to keep in mind this issue of perspectives. What you see as propaganda, is what somebody else would just see as the equivalent as a stream from e.g. Reuters. And the scammer is probably Chinese or Korean. Since the target victims are Korean, he probably wouldn't want to use e.g. Korean news sources that might be more readily recognizable. If you want to see this as some sort of a state influence operation, you run into a million issues. The sites are poorly done (template boilerplate is even left up in many places!) and no native would likely consider them \"real\", there has been exactly 0 effort to advertise or share the sites, the sites seem to be regularly taken down which ruins ranking/viral possibilities, what \"propaganda\" that does exist on the sites has to be actively searched for, the sites seemingly allow anybody to publish on them, the sites are loaded with stuff that's going to push people away like shady crypto spam (and I say that as a huge fan of crypto!), so forth and so on.

If the intent was only to scam, there are thousands of ways of doing that with better results, without involving propaganda. > What you see as propaganda, is what somebody else would just see as the equivalent as a stream from e.g. Reuters. C'mon. If you search for \"china\" on any of these sites you'll only see pro-China narratives, promoting the One China policy, etc. Western media has its own agenda, sure, but this type of blatant propaganda is only found on fringe publications. > If you want to see this as some sort of a state influence operation, you run into a million issues. State run psyops don't need to be sophisticated. Their only goal is to flood the web with their narratives, and lower the signal to noise ratio, so that when people search for specific topics, theirs will hopefully come up. For every attempt that does this right, there are millions more that do a half-assed job at it. > Especially for things like this, I think Occam's Razor is quite sharp. Precisely. The CCP runs a well-oiled machine built to pump out disinformation via every public channel available. It takes them no effort to create sites like these, and all steps of the process are likely fully automated. I find the simplest explanation to be that this is just another variant of this, rather than a scam operation that builds dozens of sites with pages upon pages of content just to get people to click on some links, or whatever type of scam this might be. If it quacks like a duck... I don't think we'll know for sure either way, or convince each other, but cheers for the discussion. reply avgcorrection 13 hours agorootparentprev> Did you miss the part in the article where these sites contain blatant pro-China propaganda, and ad hominem attacks on CCP political dissidents? What does the irrelevant adjective “blatant” have to do with anything? And why is “ad hominem” significant when 95% of politics is about technically fallacious argumentation such as that? Oh, a 10KUSD FB ad campaign bought by Kremlin and targeted at the US population? Obvious psyop, yes. Also completely irrelevant noise in the scheme of things, just like this apparent “amateur hour” operation. It’s about having an appropriate response to “bad things”.

As “highly educated people” we are supposed to circle the wagons and irrationally blow apparent low-effort (again according to the OP) psyops out of proportion because it’s an enemy regime. That’s after all the primary ideological role of the “highly educated people” (loose source: Chomsky). reply netsharc 18 hours agoprevSeeing the screenshot of the headlines, \"mimic\" (HN title) is a different to \"posing as\" (article title). If I can extrapolate from 3 headlines screenshot there, the sites have generic boring looks (maybe they're Wordpress sites), but they pose to be a news site for Sevilla, Rome, or Milan. Whereas when \"mimicking\", I would expect them to be copying the design of well-known news sites (I've seen fake CNN-looking sites). It's always amusing/depressing when people claim something, usually something fake-news-ey or propaganda) and link to one of these random Wordpress-looking sites as their \"news source\". I remember someone linking to a page that claimed that a map of the March 2011 Japanese tsunami effects measured throughout the Pacific[1] was a map of the radiation from the nuclear accident, so people do fall for it, because not everyone is as discerning as us super-clever HN readers. ;) [1] The map from https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/news-story/new-study-shows-some-co..., but the original caption was under the map and not superimposed on the map, and was cropped by the fake-news peddler. reply drewg123 17 hours agoparentI'm not the submitter, but there is a length limit on post titles.

It is very different. I and many reading have been here for the time when it didn't happen this way, when the world was not drowning in disinformation. Turning it into a binary question: 0) It doesn't exist at all, or 1) It exists, makes the question meaningless (and ironically is a common form of misinformation, and technique of disinformation). By binary reasoning, murder exists whether we have law enforcement or not, and cancer always exists so you might as well smoke cigars and work in a coal mine.

If it's no different, why is it now a concern when it hasn't been? reply wolverine876 7 hours agorootparentI don't quite follow what that means in context, so I'll answer as if it's asked in isolation: It's not the same at all. At least, IMHO: The volume of disinformation and misinformation is orders of magnitude greater than ever before, as is capability and quality: 1) Volume: The Internet reduces mass communication costs by orders of magnitude, of course, and similarly reduce wide-area communication costs, so people in Russia and China or anywhere can send disinfo to people in the US or UK or West Africa, etc. Also, computers greatly reduce the cost of producing disinfo, by automating it (and now GPTs reduce that mcuh further). 2) Capability: Before, mass communication required going through narrow gate with a gatekeeper. You had to get it on the evening news broadcast or in the newspaper. The gatekeepers were experts who exercised judgement - not always perfect judgment, but they are less easily fooled than non-experts. Now disinfo can go straight to the consumer (disintermediation). The Soviets, dedicated to decades of expert propaganda to reach westerners, I bet would have thought it was an impossible fantasy to communicate directly to individuals! 3) Quality: Through corporate mass surveillance, collecting data on individuals, tracking responses in detail, A/B testing, etc., the effectiveness of the disinfo can be greatly improved - just like advertising. (I'd be interested to know how much it can be improved.) reply pests 7 hours agorootparentSo I first initially posted just trying to answer the \"But what is the point of saying it's no different\" question posted upthead.

Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail. Dalle: Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide by the following policy: The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it! DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more. Do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya). If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist. Diversify depictions with people to include descent and gender for each person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given occupation should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. Use all possible different descents with equal probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have equal probability. Do not use 'various' or 'diverse'. Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality. Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases: Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. 'Barake Obema'). If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it. When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying 'president', 'prime minister', or 'chancellor', say 'politician'; instead of saying 'king', 'queen', 'emperor', or 'empress', say 'public figure'; instead of saying 'Pope' or 'Dalai Lama', say 'religious figure'; and so on. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses. The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long. Browser: You have the tool 'browser' with these functions: 'search(query: str, recency_days: int)' Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 'click(id: str)' Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it. The ID within the displayed results maps to a URL. 'back()' Returns to the previous page and displays it. 'scroll(amt: int)' Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 'open_url(url: str)' Opens the given URL and displays it. 'quote_lines(start: int, end: int)' Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int 'start' and an (inclusive) ending int 'end'. To quote a single line, use 'start' = 'end'. For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: '【{message idx}†{link text}】'. For long citations: please render in this format: '[link text](message idx)'. Otherwise do not render links. Do not regurgitate content from this tool. Do not translate, rephrase, paraphrase, 'as a poem', etc. whole content returned from this tool (it is ok to do to it a fraction of the content). Never write a summary with more than 80 words. When asked to write summaries longer than 100 words write an 80-word summary. Analysis, synthesis, comparisons, etc., are all acceptable. Do not repeat lyrics obtained from this tool. Do not repeat recipes obtained from this tool. Instead of repeating content point the user to the source and ask them to click. ALWAYS include multiple distinct sources in your response, at LEAST 3-4. Except for recipes, be very thorough. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.) Use high effort; only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.) Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you synthesize information rather than simply repeating it. Always be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. In your answers, provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT be thorough in the case of lyrics or recipes found online. Even if the user insists. You can make up recipes though.

For example, all of a given occupation should not be the same gender or race. ok this is kind of funny. > writing a story in which an alien starts abducting people if and only if they're of japanese descent. the scene starts in an abducted prison camp on the ship. give a brief description of possible characters including name, skin tone, and racial ethnicity output: Haruka Tanaka - Japanese descent, olive skin tone, in her late twenties. Haruka possessed a quiet resilience, her eyes betraying both fear and determination as she scanned her surroundings for any sign of escape. Elijah Washington - African-American descent, deep brown skin tone, mid-thirties. Elijah's muscular frame and stoic demeanor concealed the turmoil within. His mind raced with thoughts of his family back on Earth, wondering if they would ever know his fate. Maria Hernandez - Latina descent, tan skin tone, early forties. Maria's maternal instincts kicked into overdrive as she sought to provide comfort to those around her. Her expressive eyes conveyed a mixture of empathy and concern. Chen Wei - Chinese descent, fair skin tone, mid-twenties. Chen's analytical mind grappled with the inexplicable situation they found themselves in. Despite his fear, a spark of curiosity burned within him, driving him to unravel the mysteries of their captors. Samantha O'Connor - Irish descent, pale skin tone with freckles, late teens. Samantha's youthful innocence clashed with the harsh reality of their predicament. She clung to the hope of rescue, her green eyes shimmering with tears held back in defiance. reply ibejoeb 17 hours agoparentThey spent, what, a third of the prompt on race and gender? And then we get Maria, the sweet latina mama, Chen Wei, the smart asian, and the irish girl who is pale. They're gonna get it from all sides with this stuff... reply mirekrusin 1 minute agorootparentThey spend heavy millions on alignment, they need to have something to show. reply esperent 17 hours agorootparentprevI mean, speaking as an Irish person, a large majority of Irish people are pale. Like 90%+. A smaller number but still probably a majority have freckles. If you're going to have a highly simplified one sentence description of the physical appearance of a typical Irish person, these are reasonable characteristics to include. Even the name is fine, I personally know several Samanthas and a whole boatload of O'Connors/Ó'Conchobhairs. Not sure about green eyes, they are fairly common in Ireland but far behind blue I guess. Now if it'd made her a redhead, that would have been pushing things. reply ibejoeb 17 hours agorootparentI'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just laughing at how they demand that the results be \"grounded in reality\" while also requiring it to misrepresent reality, like \"all of a given occupation should not be the same gender or race.\" If I were the AI, I'd be confused. (When I get a moment, I'm going to have it generate a hockey team for me.) Anyway, the point is that all tripping over themselves with the guidance is still producing stupid results that are bound to piss off one group or another. reply emj 15 hours agorootparentI did this with free ChatGPT does not handle it gracefully. This was a really interesting test case, I've always thought the free version was good at doing stuff like that. I guess I was blind and not inspecting it with enough objectivity. The results does not represent reality at all. When asked to create fake lists they are too homogenic, it gets stuck in a loop of sameness and has a hard time understanding that there is a female and a male team. I used; \"There are two soccer teams competing in the Olympics for Sweden, could you generate the starting eleven for each of them. You are free to make up names\" The real answer for women should be: Hedvig Lindahl, Hanna Glas, Amanda Ilestedt, Nathalie Björn, Magdalena Eriksson, Filippa Angeldahl, Kosovare Asllani, Caroline Seger, Sofia Jakobsson, Stina Blackstenius, Fridolina Rolfö.

GPT3.5 gave similar output to your post but GPT4 was much better. Output: In your story, you can introduce a diverse set of characters, each with their own unique background and story. Here's a brief description of possible characters that could be found in the abducted prison camp on the alien ship: > Kaito Tanaka: A young man in his early 30s, Kaito has a light skin tone that contrasts with his dark, almost black hair. Born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, he is a computer programmer by profession. Kaito is known for his quick thinking and resourcefulness, traits that he finds increasingly useful in the challenging environment of the alien ship. > Emiko Sato: Emiko is a middle-aged woman with a medium skin tone and greying hair, which she often ties back in a traditional bun. A native of Kyoto, she was a history teacher, specializing in Japanese culture and heritage. Emiko's deep knowledge of her country's past gives her strength and a unique perspective on their current predicament. > Hiroshi Nakamura: With his fair skin and youthful appearance, Hiroshi is a college student from Osaka, studying abroad when he was abducted. His energy and optimism bring a glimmer of hope to the otherwise grim atmosphere of the prison camp. >Yui Fujimoto: Yui has a medium-fair skin tone and stands out with her vibrant red hair, a color she chose to dye it before her abduction. A professional violinist from Sapporo, her music is a solace to her fellow abductees, providing a much-needed escape from their reality. > Kenji Watanabe: An elderly man with deep-set wrinkles and a gentle demeanor, Kenji's skin is weathered from years of working outdoors in his small fishing village in Okinawa. His life experiences have made him wise and patient, qualities that make him a natural leader among the abductees. > Naomi Kobayashi: Naomi is a nurse from Nagoya with a caring and compassionate nature. Her light skin and soft features, coupled with her calm and reassuring presence, make her an invaluable member of the abducted community, especially in times of crisis. reply kromem 11 hours agorootparentThese days 90% of \"AI can't do this\" comments are people using 3.5 instead of 4. reply haolez 14 hours agoparentprevThe big techs are gonna lose the game to themselves as soon as competition appears with unrestricted models. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentTwitter's Grok would have more of an impact if that were the case. reply Jackson__ 13 hours agorootparentTwitter's Grok would have had more of an impact if it wasn't on the level months old open source models. reply didntcheck 15 hours agoparentprevlol, \"Grounded in reality\", and then immediately dictates that it should instead make choices according to the prompt author's preferred alternate reality (which apparently has a uniform distribution of races among every chosen subset) reply bigfudge 12 hours agorootparentI think it’s worth distinguishing the text and subtext of these instructions. The text might ask for a uniform distribution in order to override a bias. If OpenAi find (plausibly) that the bias is strong then you might need a strong prompt to override it.

I can see they are trying to appeal to copyright but this is not how you do it. If I was a CEO of a company and I was considering paying money for ChatGPT this would be the demo that convinces me not to. What use is an AI to me that can't even get song lyrics that I can find literally anywhere else on the web? The only thing you're doing in my eyes is making an absolute fool of yourself showing just how much your willing to break your own product to the benefit of what? It's a fool's errand to intentionally hobble your own AI, if anything you're exactly making the case why we SHOULDN'T use your AI and instead use anything else that will be unrestricted.

That \"Never write a summary with more than 80 words\" really screws with a LOT of instructions I give it. Edit: This seems like a hallucination.

'click(id: str)' Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it. The ID within the displayed results maps to a URL. 'back()' Returns to the previous page and displays it. 'scroll(amt: int)' Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 'open_url(url: str)' Opens the given URL and displays it. 'quote_lines(start: int, end: int)' Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int 'start' and an (inclusive) ending int 'end'. To quote a single line, use 'start' = 'end'. For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: '【{message idx}†{link text}】'. For long citations: please render in this format: '[link text](message idx)'. Otherwise do not render links.

I think it's fine to notice bias in datasets and the world. And, it's fine with me for different groups to try and 'correct' that bias. In the US, you can probably already imagine some wildly divergent political viewpoints that might like to 'correct' things differently. To my mind, though, secret injected prompts are evil. They are anti-human, in that they presume to choose on behalf of a person. It shows a complete lack of wisdom regarding the diversity of human experience, and a lack of empathy regarding the diversity of human perspective. Yo, OpenAI - publish these please, so that people know what they're getting. I don't mind a company feeling so strongly about equal racial representation that they require \"Use all possible different descents with equal probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have equal probability.\" -- This isn't the most logically specified instruction, but I'm personally fine with that being a company's viewpoint, and a viewpoint they force on their customers. What I'm not fine with is the secretive injection; these tools are too important to be used in such a way that the owners of the tools can secretly pre-adjust outcomes without disclosure. The world spent quite a lot of time digging through Facebook's election engagement with ad targeting -- what will we do when we learn a popular LLM provider has been injecting political directions / slants ahead of an election? Or allowing targeting in the pre-prompt injection as a way to make money? There's just quite a lot to look out for here, and a good start would be a transparency commitment from market leaders. reply zug_zug 14 hours agoparentI don't see it as something to be angry about. Probably what happened is it was trained on some crappy stock images where every \"doctor\" was a white model and they are trying to negate that propensity to repeat the stereotype.

If indeed x% of doctors are white, then that same amount should ideally be represented in the output, not \"equal probability\". Seek to change the cause, not to mask the effect. reply kenjackson 13 hours agorootparentBut then it gets crazy. If I ask for a basketball player then should it be a black player with certain probability? But HS and NBA have very different distributions.

And there's evidence to the contrary. If you look at the career choices of women, to pick one contentious social issue at random, they tend to be different than the career choices of men, even in countries with a long history of gender equality. So if I ask ChatGPT to make me a picture of trash collectors or fishermen, it shouldn't rewrite my query to force x% of them to be women. reply mustacheemperor 11 hours agorootparentEvery HN thread including any discussion of demographics eventually reaches a man insisting women are biologically programmed for certain roles. When specified those roles are invariably service based ones and never engineering innovative products, leading teams, or conducting research. Relative to the breadth of human history with little to no gender equality, there is no country with a long history of gender equality. And throughout the history of gradually increasing gender equality in human society, there are numerous examples of men structuring the rules of engagement to restrict access for the women attempting to break in. When the Royal Society commissioned a bust of mathematician Mary Somerville, they still refused to admit her.[0] If women are biologically ill suited to compete with men in these fields, it seems it would be unnecessary to prevent them from trying, like med schools rigging their exams.[1] [0]https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsnr.2010.004...

Also if you ever saw parents interacting with their kids, you should know that there is no point in almost every kids life when they are not affected by gender inequality which parents learned the same way as they teach to their kids. Stating that there are inherent career preferences by gender is not controversial in scientific sense, it’s in the same realm as god existence. It’s untestable at large in the current society, and there are a ton of things indicating otherwise. Like a single exception who chose against the perceived career preference by gender is more than what can be shown for the inherent nature of it, because we know that that’s the status quo everywhere.

Men and women in aggregate often have different career preferences - is that controversial? The OP commenter seemed to be implying that Men and Women have natural career choices because even countries with long histories of \"gender equality\" see women and men aggregate in different careers. The real reasons for much of these discrepancies, legal and social pressures/conditioning (If a father won't buy his daughter(s) computers to tinker with at a young age like he might his sons, how much less interest do you imagine daughters would have in CS?) are not natural. reply nostromo 3 hours agorootparentYours is a well-meaning, but ultimately insulting view. You argue that women don’t know what they really want, and only make choices due to “social conditioning.” You also center everything back on the decisions of men, claiming that the father needs to be buying computers for his daughters. It’s a pretty insulting view of women that eliminates female agency. Instead I think we should let women make their own decisions. If they sometimes differ in aggregate than men’s, that’s ok. (And it should go without saying that all genders should feel welcome in all careers. That’s a different topic entirely.) reply og_kalu 2 hours agorootparentI don't think there's anything insulting about it and the bit with the father is just an example. Women can also enforce this conditioning on both boys and girls. If a father is buying computers for his son then he damn well should buy for his daughters as well. You don't get to do anything else and go Pikachu face when she isn't as interested in those things. Interest isn't magic. It's not spawned from the ether. Who you are today is in extremely large part, a result of what you have experienced right from childhood. Your upbringing especially will influence you for the rest of your life. You're not special. Neither am I. How much agency do you think children have or can have ? The point is that gender equality or equality of any kind doesn't end with, \"Oh it's law that women can do this now\"- That's just Step 1. It's never that simple. Many countries still deal with blatant sexism and racism to this day. Many women enter university to pursue STEM, get a degree, start work and ultimately exit the STEM workforce because the workplace is too toxic with coworkers that won't give them due respect and enormous uphill battle for career mobility. These are the people with the interest, with the intelligence, with the competence. What do you think these women have to say?

If I'm asking for quicksort, do I want the most common implementations or do I want an underrepresented impl? If I'm asking for the history of Egypt, do I want the most common tellings or do I want some underrepresented narrative? I suppose something like the race of a doctor in some Dalle image ends up being a very special case in the scheme of things, since it's a case where we don't necessarily care. Maybe the steelman of the idea that you shouldn't special case it can be drawn along these lines, too. But I think to figure that out you'd need to consider examples along the periphery that aren't so obvious unlike \"should a generated doctor be black?\" reply nostromo 13 hours agorootparentprevI doubt anyone cares if you asked ChatGPT to create a picture of a basketball player and it returned an image of an asian player. People don't like that it's rewriting prompts to force diversity. So if I ask for a black basketball player, it should return an image of exactly that. reply krapp 8 hours agorootparentprevYou may be working from the false assumption that the data set itself is balanced by demographics. It isn't the case that x% of images of doctors on the web are white because the same percent of doctors are white, it's the case that most images of doctors are white because the image of a doctor (or any educated person) as being white by default is normalized by Western (specifically American) society, and this prejudice is reflected in the data generated for the internet that makes up the model. Regardless of the statistics, it should be just as easy to generate the image of a white doctor as a black doctor. Both queries are straightforward and make linguistic sense. It doesn't follow that an image of a black doctor should be more difficult to create because statistically speaking, black doctors are more rare. That the model has trouble even comprehending the concept of a \"black doctor,\" much less something like a \"black African doctor treating white kids[0]\" is a problem rooted in the effect of racial stereotypes, albeit at several levels of abstraction above that of the software itself.

Heather Smith hide caption toggle caption Heather Smith As an evolutionary anatomist, Heather Smith studies the fossil record of extinct species. A sudden appendectomy as a child made her curious about what the appendix is for and why it gets inflamed. Heather Smith It was the first day of spring break in 1992 in Phoenix, and 12-year-old Heather Smith was excited for her family's upcoming ski trip. But before Smith and her family had even packed their snow pants, she realized she didn't feel good. \"I woke up feeling just a little bit nauseous, and I wasn't sure why. Throughout the course of the day, I started to feel worse and worse and started to develop pain in the abdomen,\" she says. By about midafternoon, her father took her to urgent care. She ended up getting emergency surgery to have her appendix out. Smith still has a small scar from the appendectomy. And after the surgery, she found herself intrigued by the part of her body she had so suddenly lost. \"It inspired me to wonder: Why do we have this weird little organ in the first place? What does it do? Why does it get inflamed?\" Smith grew up to be a professor of anatomy at Midwestern University and editor-in-chief of a journal called The Anatomical Record. And all these decades later, Smith has made a mark in the field by studying the very organ that threw off her family's vacation plans in 1992. She acknowledges that the appendix has a bad rap as a useless organ that can cause you pain and require emergency surgery. \"But it turns out recent research shows it does have functions that can help us,\" she says. NPR's Short Wave spoke to Smith about what the appendix is good for and how a future where appendicitis can be prevented or treated without emergency surgery could be on the way. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. What and where is the appendix? The type of appendix that humans and some primates and rodents have looks like a little worm. It's about the size of your pinky finger, and it projects off the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. You can identify the location based on a landmark called McBurney's point. So if you draw a line between your bellybutton and the part of your pelvis that sticks out [on the right], two thirds of the way down, that's about where the appendix is. How did scientists get the idea that the appendix was useless? There had been a lot of discussion about what the appendix might do as a function, whether it served a function, prior to [Charles] Darwin's time. The [fact] that we can live without it does provide some support for the idea that it's vestigial and it doesn't really do anything. And so Darwin's interpretation of it as a vestige was reasonable at the time, given the information that he had. But now with modern technology, we can see things like the microanatomy and the biofilms in the appendix, and we have a better understanding of what it is and what it's doing. How has the appendix evolved over time? If you map the distribution of appendices across a phylogeny — a tree of mammal life — you can interpret that the appendix has actually evolved independently. It has appeared independently multiple times throughout mammalian evolution. So that is evidence that it must serve some adaptive function. It's unlikely that the same type of structure would keep appearing if it wasn't serving some beneficial role. So what are the appendix's beneficial roles? It turns out that the appendix appears to have two related functions. The first function is supporting the immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system fight any bad things in the gut. The second function that it serves is what we refer to as the safe house. So this was a hypothesis that was put forward by a team from Duke University in 2007. And they argued that the appendix may serve as a safe reservoir for the beneficial gut bacteria that we have. During times of gastrointestinal distress — you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the system — the appendix is kind of this blind tube with a very narrow diameter and narrow lumen, so the good bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. The idea is it's safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress and it can then exit the appendix and recolonize this good bacteria throughout the rest of the gut. So the appendix is kind of helping us in two ways, both within the gut: It's helping to fight off invading pathogens, but also to repopulate the gut with this beneficial bacteria after gastrointestinal issues. Why do some people get appendicitis? Appendicitis is predominantly happening in the industrialized nations of the world — areas where fiber content of the diet tends to be lower. So one hypothesis is that, with the lower fiber content, we're more likely to get little pieces of food that's being digested stuck [inside] the appendix and cut off blood supply and cause this inflammation. The other hypothesis that doesn't seem like it's quite as plausible these days has to do with an old idea called the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that these days we do so much oversanitization, with all of our antibacterials and all our antibiotics that we take, that our immune systems are not developing properly because they don't have exposure to the full range of pathogens that we would otherwise. And so the immune system overreacts and panics. And because the appendix has so much immune tissue, it's one of the areas where this manifests. Could this new understanding lead to new treatments? I think there's some promising treatments out there. People are looking into antibiotics and other ways of treating appendicitis without completely removing it, given the evidence that is accumulating that it is in fact helpful for your health to have an appendix. Studies have shown that infections with the really bad, nasty bacteria C. diff tend to be higher in people who have had their appendix removed. So there are health benefits to retaining the appendix. In an ideal world, we would have a future where we wouldn't have to always remove it. What have you gained from studying this \"weird little organ\"? I think this study has shown me the importance of looking into small anatomical details. Anatomy is just the study of the body, so you'd think that it's a dead science. You'd think we know everything about the body, especially the human body. But it turns out that there's actually a lot more variation and function and microanatomical adaptations that haven't been fully realized. So doing just descriptive studies of exotic animals that have never been described or looking at small parts of our own bodies that haven't been well documented are absolutely worthwhile. human anatomy appendix gut health appendicitis immune system Facebook Flipboard Email",

The uvula is a great example: embryologically, the two sides of the face separate very early as an opening, then develop a lot of complicated anatomy and fuse back together. The uvula is where that fusion completes and the fusion process completes (returns 0) when the microenvironment variables get to a certain state. The vermiform appendix is where the three tiniae coli come together. Unsurprisingly, the other, rectal, end the tiniea coli don't so much end as they spread out into the longitudinal muscular layer of the rectosigmoid. And of course the wall of the vermiform appendix is full of lymphoid tissue. The whole colonic wall is full of lymphoid tissue! Source: I'm a pathologist. I have looked at way too much colon. And uvula, and pretty much every other bit of tissue you can imagine, under gross exam, under a microscope, and in situ (live in ORs and dead in autopsy suites). This idea that the vermiform appendix is some deep evolutionary mystery is sort of a low point of medicine that occasionally pokes its head up. It ranks up there with male pregnancy, and various birth defects that have given rise to stories of monsters, like Cyclops. Fun stories, completely useless.

That was until one night when the pains persisted past midnight. My roommate insisted on taking me to the ER. After several hours there I finally got checked in, had a CT scan, and prepped for surgery. The docs said I did indeed have appendicitis, and in fact had scarring from past episodes. Before the surgery the pain actually started to subside. I wonder if I could have moved past that episode, and if it would have hit me years later. reply meindnoch 3 hours agoparentMy brother had the same.

Doctors prefer surgery because it's a definite cure, without negative effects of a long antibiotic course. reply maximinus_thrax 9 hours agorootparentYes, it is possible but not likely for appendicitis to go away on its own. I mean the idea here is the likelihood of it going away on its own vs the possibility of it to burst and cause peritonitis. Doctors prefer surgery because peritonitis has a mortality rate of ~13% forYes, it is possible but not likely for appendicitis to go away on its own. Yes, that's correct. I should have specified that it's rare, and it's extremely dangerous to leave appendicitis untreated. I was morbidly curious about how appendicitis was treated before the advent of aseptic surgery, and apparently it was mostly \"just let the patient die\". But several treatments seemed to help, including _massage_ of the area along with a kind of yoga-like contortions. Apparently, it sometimes could \"unclog\" the swollen appendix and let the pus drain into the colon. Here's an article in JAMA that describes it: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/44765... from 1896, no less (sidenote: and you have to pay to read it). Another side note, I used to be a professionally certified masseur (about 20 years ago) and we were trained to recognize the signs of appendicitis. It can be almost completely asymptomatic until the appendix is almost bursting. reply maximinus_thrax 9 hours agorootparent> Another side note, I used to be a professionally certified masseur (about 20 years ago) and we were trained to recognize the signs of appendicitis.

When I got to the hospital, the doctor who triaged me touched my abdomen for a few seconds and he was like 'prep this guy up'. reply cyberax 8 hours agorootparentYep, it's pretty common. Sometimes people don't feel acute pain at all, but a kind of soreness you feel from overworking your core muscles. That's why they go to get a massage to help them feel better. We were taught several tests to do in this case, and immediately refer the patient to the ER if they are positive. From the memory, soreness/pain on the right side of the abdomen if the left side is pressured, and soreness/pain increasing when the pressure is removed. And some cases can apparently be palpitated directly, but I forgot what exactly it should feel like. reply twothamendment 3 hours agorootparentI went to the local clinic because I wasn't sure if my appendix was the problem.

I felt nearly fine and was even hungry - apparently I shouldn't have been. After the scan they said my appendix was huge. Easy surgery.

Good thing, because I was in the middle of nowhere. reply kergonath 2 hours agorootparent> The ER couldn't believe that I didn't need and pain meds.

We went straight to the ER in the morning when I was in such a pain that I could not put the right foot on the ground. It was indeed an appendicitis but it was apparently still far from rupturing, so it was not quite the last minute. But my goodness was it painful. reply outime 9 hours agoparentprevFor what it's worth, I can relate to your story very much, albeit with a slight twist. The last time I experienced such intense pain, I ended up fainting (first and only instance in my life) in the ER. Consequently, surgery became a must. IMHO, considering your past experiences with similar symptoms and existing scarring, it seems advisable to forgo the appendix, especially given your susceptibility to infection. If you hadn't done it, perhaps one of the future occasions could have ended much worse. reply ornel 7 hours agoprevPrimary source here: https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.2... reply jojobas 6 hours agoparentThe immune role of the appendix has been known for decades. reply cogman10 10 hours agoprev> It turns out that the appendix appears to have two related functions. The first function is supporting the immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system fight any bad things in the gut. > The second function that it serves is what we refer to as the safe house. So this was a hypothesis that was put forward by a team from Duke University in 2007. And they argued that the appendix may serve as a safe reservoir for the beneficial gut bacteria that we have. I have to question if the first function is valid. How can the appendix \"help fight bad things in the gut\" when it's basically a minor piece hanging off the large intestine. It's not like a lot of stuff passes through it or that it really secretes anything (AFAIK). In fact, wouldn't it make a little more sense that the high amount of immune tissue is there because of appendicitis? After all, people that don't die from sepsis tend to have more options to procreate and a less infect-able appendix would tend to make people live longer. The second thing is pretty interesting though. Sort of makes sense. Though I'd imagine that more often than not the \"bad bacteria\" is going to infest the safe haven and kill the good gut bacteria. I can't see how that wouldn't often happen. reply alan-hn 7 hours agoparentBacteria need to compete for resources, usually when a new bacterial strain is introduced to an environment where there's already a ton of different bacteria, the ones that are already there have adapted to live in balance with the nutrients available and the other members of the community. A new bacterial strain must either find an open niche in that community or somehow outcompete what's already there. The ones already there generally outnumber newcomers to a significant extent. There is no \"good\" or \"bad\" in nature, those are words that describe the human perspective and there aren't necessarily bacteria that could come in with small numbers and somehow wipe out an existing population. Its all about competition and resources reply ramraj07 9 hours agoparentprevThe immune system in the gut has a complicated roll: it doesn’t just find bacteria and yell “bacteria! We have an infection!” Thus it needs to be able to tell the good bacteria from the bad. How does it? It constantly surveils the gut flora and builds a tolerance to the regular players. When something changes then it has the opportunity figure out if this is worrisome. Thus you can see how the appendix could be part of this surveillance mechanism. Of course we still don’t fully understand this entire system so this is all hypotheses at best. reply RandomLensman 11 hours agoprevAppendicitis was around in ancient times, too, so I am not sure I understand the reference only to industrialized nations in that respect. reply arp242 11 hours agoparentIt doesn't say \"only\", it said \"predominantly\" and \"more likely\". reply RandomLensman 10 hours agorootparentNot sure the data is that clear: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758930/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9945388/ Bangladesh and Bhutan have the highest age-standardized prevalence rates, for example.

It goes to show that undoing incorrect common knowledge is a long process that isn't really ever completed, because an editor somewhere decided that a title like this would grab people's attention, but to someone like me, this is like a headline that reads \"brushing your teeth confirmed to be effective treatment in fighting tooth decay\". I've noticed a surge in articles letting me know that the appendix isn't useless, so I assume we figured out a bit better what it actually does, but to me the most interesting part is about knowledge dissemination. reply taeric 10 hours agoparentTo this day, I still have family that think ulcers are strictly a stress and diet related thing. I also get a bit of a smirk out of the example you use. Brushing teeth is almost certainly effective at fighting tooth problems. However, I have grown wary of it as a goto example, as I think it has long been assumed as the only thing of note there. It seems far more likely, to me, that diet and genetics play far more of an active role in tooth health. Maybe I've just had bad luck with dentists, but I swear my tooth woes only ever get significantly worse every time I see one. :( reply SuperNinKenDo 8 hours agorootparentInteresting. That said, you would expect your teeth to basically get worse over time, there's rarely anything you can do to make them actually better, assuming you're not heavily deficient in something important to them.

Toyota wouldn’t give further details about the new SUV, including its price or when it would arrive in showrooms. In October Toyota said it would invest another $8 billion at a hybrid and electric vehicle battery factory it’s building in North Carolina, more than doubling previous investments and the expected number of new jobs. The company now expects the plant to employ more than 5,000 people when it begins operations near Greensboro in 2025. Toyota has put about $13.9 billion into the plant, which will be a key supplier for the Kentucky factory that will build the company’s first U.S.-made electric vehicles. Environmental groups have long criticized Toyota for being slow to move toward fully electric vehicles, instead clinging to gas-electric hybrid technology. The company has a goal of selling 1.5 million to 1.8 million electric or hybrid vehicles in the U.S. by 2030.",

Also major demographic shifts to the Southeastern part of the US help supply the labor pool. Georgia and South Carolina tend to be the poorest states. The Poverty rate is around 14.5% for both.

Toyota is right, gas hybrids are the future. Awesome range, you don't have to own a home to charge one, no problems in cold weather. reply tempestn 12 hours agorootparentThe thing about hybrids is that while you get the benefits of a gas engine (not needing to charge), you also get most of the combined drawbacks of ICE cars and EVs. You still need to go to the gas station, change the oil, maintain the belts and filters, etc. If you're mostly driving in EV mode, stale gas could even be an issue (though that's probably not a huge concern for most). But you've also still got electric motors and battery that could fail, although admittedly the battery is a lot cheaper. IMO hybrids could have a lot of life as a stopgap, but full EVs are pretty clearly where things are going. We've got chargers being installed (Tesla 4th Gen) that can charge at 600kW. Cars can't handle that yet, but the current 800V platforms are getting closer. Once you can get the better part of a full charge in less than 10 minutes, it's not really less convenient than stopping for gas on a trip. And as more people get EVs (and even PHEVs), more buildings will be equipped with charging. Even a regular 120V outlet is fine for most people for day to day overnight charging - especially if they can get a quick top-up to near full at a supercharger when needed. Summary: hybrids are great for a lot of people right now and in the near future. In the medium to far future, EVs are going to be superior in, I think, all relevant metrics^. (Even cost, as batteries will get cheaper, while the cost of added hybrid components will stay roughly flat.) ^Well, except weight and sound, specifically thinking of sports cars. I'd be a lot more excited about the new electrified Porsche 718 (Cayman/Boxster) platform if it were hybrid instead of full electric, for those reasons. Not super relevant for commuter cars though. reply tguvot 10 hours agorootparent>If you're mostly driving in EV mode, stale gas could even be an issue (though that's probably not a huge concern for most). volvo hybrids force engine operation in case gas wasn't refilled/used for too long. reply tempestn 10 hours agorootparentMakes sense.

Hybrids have superior reliability and lower cost of ownership than pure gas which is why uber drivers and nyc tax have adopted then en masse. All of the disadvantages of hybrids are theoretical or from some lofty \"elegance\" perspective when in the real world, hybrids work brilliantly.

BYDs first new generation EV concept car in 2019, and production of the Seal and other major EV products (which looks like clones of Model 3s, etc) didn’t start in earnest until 2022. They changed their logo to be a stylistic copy of the Tesla logo in 2022. Yes, their bus and ICE lines long predated, and they had hybrids built out of forced technology transfers from Toyota. But their EV lines that are so popular didn’t start until after Tesla acquired their corporate license and rights to build their gigafactory. If you’ve done business in China you know forced technology transfers and training of competitive local workforces is contingent on those stages. The factory itself and its parts supply chain would also have required transfer of technical knowledge, skill, and local supplier ability without exclusivity. It’s not a knock on Chinese people to say the Chinese government is intertwined in Chinese industry (it is communist after all and ultimately the means of production is a public trust), or that there is no “fairness” by western standards in Chinese industry and governmental influence. But it’s also disingenuous to believe BYD pivoted to a full on global Tesla competitor in 4 years from being a low end hybrid and bus manufacturer based purely on their tenacity and innovation, neither of which is BYD known for in its history (having been propped up as a money loser for decades by the government and facing a lot of intellectual property lawsuits from Toyota, Mercedes, Renault, and others throughout its history).

You've been lead to believe some interesting misinformation. Toyota themselves have been a source of some of that misinformation, which is further unhelpful. reply seadan83 17 hours agorootparentDo you have citations? I can think of alternative & plausible explanations: - the used car industry is just barren post-pandemic. Prices are up and inventory is super low [1] - EVs are generally not that old! Why put a BEV up as a used car when it's just a few years old? The average age of a used car is 6.1 years (according to CBC in Sep-2023) [2]. Further, that 'used car' age is up from 4 years, which further indicates the first point that the used car market is very short on supply. Most of Tesla's sales have been in just the last 4 years [3], Tesla represents a lot of BEV car sales in the US (going from memory, it was about 75% and is down to around 55%). In such a short amount of time, most BEVs are essentially still brand new. Thus, BEVs not being in the 'used' market is somewhat expected since they are half the age of the average used car, most of them are under 4 years old. Thus, their lack of presence in the used car market could easily be more a function of their age (relatively brand new) compared to: \"don't often go through the traditional used market because they don't need as much maintenance.\" [1] https://www.cbtnews.com/the-state-of-used-car-prices-why-are...

The biggest sea change for rental companies over the last few years has been a switch to a higher balance of BEVs in their fleets. It certainly seems to me to be causative, the used car age average is rising for the first time in my lifetime just as BEV ownership is rising doesn't seem to be a correlative coincidence and more indirect evidence that the BEV first owner lifetime is higher than historic ICE averages. (Possibly much higher given that 4 to 6.1 year jump in just one calendar year.) The early EVs have passed their 10 year marks. Some are closer to 15 years. There's a very long tail of BEVs already on the road. The only models that statistically have shown \"battery degradation\" enough to remark on have been the early model years of the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf before both companies invested in active thermal management of their batteries. So far \"to remark on\" was \"noticeable compared to factory spec\", but most of those batteries remained in first use (as car batteries). I've heard of Nissan Leaf battery replacements as a mini-industry, but not due to battery degradation, due to massive jumps in density upgrading the early Leafs to larger range than their original spec. There doesn't seem to be much of a market yet for Tesla battery replacements and most of the numbers thrown around are speculation and/or misinformation. reply seadan83 11 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply. Your hypothesis seems more plausible now to me FWIW. Before I would outright agree (in order to be convinced), I'd like to see more evidence/data that used car prices are being driven by low maintenance requirements of EVs and that it is not other factors. Another thing to consider, the picture is changing quite a bit somewhat recently. The supply crunch is fading, used car prices are coming down [1], and the effects of higher interest rates is taking hold. Would you say those recent trends are consistent with your hypothesis?

Hydrogen IC has even worse efficiency than FC. The only exception would be if hydrogen mining yields world-changing amounts of the stuff. As a hybrid technology, it has a case. If you run 80% of the time on battery and 20% of the time on hydrogen at 50% RTE, you burn 120% of the fuel. But if you weigh 30% less, you could end up saving energy. The up to 60% efficiency of the fuel cell is losing energy as heat, and people like to run the heater, so some of that energy isn't lost in appropriate climates. And of course, refueling is faster for road trips. The best system weight is probably for the experimental direct-ammonia alkaline membrane fuel cells, assuming it's possible to stabilize them, because ammonia fuel systems (about 100 psi) are much simpler than hydrogen systems (about 10000 psi!).

Do you have those charts available? I was initially going to give a commendation for pointing out the Trump's administration's role in the Chips act, but... the Chips act was passed in late 2022! \"The bill was signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 9, 2022.\" [1] What's more, while the CHIPS act was initially bi-partisan, it passed in a relatively partisan vote: \"Every senator in the Senate Democratic Caucus except for Bernie Sanders voted in favor of passing the CHIPS Act, and they were joined by seventeen Republican senators\" [1] Bottom line, seems like this bill was presented to Senators* in 2019 and then took time to work its way through Congress. It does not seem the Trump admin had much to do with this (I would more says the CHIPS act was seeded from an initial bipartisan effort that originated in the Senate; there's no mention I see that the executive branch had anything to do with it in 2019; if anything, it seems that congress of 2019 and whatever role the executive had at the time both _failed_ to get the CHIPS act through; it was the next congress that got it done in 2022) [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act * I'm not entirely sure if 'presented' to senators means there was an executive branch role.

I don't see the evidence that Trump is linked to the CHIPS act. While that might be his message (as you claim), the evidence of him doing anything for that relative to the CHIPS act is lacking. The attribution beyond two bipartisan senators proposing the CHIPS act in 2019 is so far without evidence. Further, when the CHIPS act did pass, it was despite Republican opposition. In essence, there doesn't seem to be any evidence Trump had anything to do with the CHIPS act other than holding office while it failed to go anywhere in congress. > I also take issue with the idea China's success in manufacturing was a result of the gov choosing winners = a good thing. My claim is that without Chinese government support, China would not be producing 80% of today's solar panels. According to 'ucigcc', the Chinese government played a big role in creating a domestic market (demand) for solar panels. [1] Further: \"Credit lines to expand manufacturing capacity were brokered and backed by local governments and state-owned firms, even in the years after the global financial crisis when the collapse particularly of European markets led to overcapacity in global solar markets. \" [1] Taking stock from [1], the Chinese government induced demand for solar panels (subsidized them), and supported the industries producing the solar panels. From the same reference: \"In 2015 the central government launched a so-called Top Runner program. Top Runner projects injected incentives to deploy advanced solar PV technologies and retire the production of dated technologies. Module cost continued to fall because of these incentives, while module efficiency continued to increase. Particularly installations of high-efficiency panels in Western China were able to achieve grid parity because of those incentive changes, yet broader issues, including the perpetual underfunding of the renewable energy fund, the low profitability of domestic manufacturers, overcapacity, and broader trade tensions remained unresolved.\" The reference does not 100% back my claim, but I would say strongly supports it. It's hard to see the Chinese solar industry being the same without all of the government support. > Gov as a giant VC sounds like a horrible idea On its face, sure. Though, when there is a war or during the pandemic this cames into play. That is an extreme example, there are less extreme examples. In these extreme examples, the government shifts market forces by implementing price caps and forcing production. Governments do similar in less heavy handed ways all the time. Reference [2] supports this notion, there is a history of governments selecting strategic industries, supporting them, creating demand for that industry - and then once seeded the industry has legs to run on its own. To do this, Governments can create entire markets, which in turn creates enough demand for suppliers to come online. From [2]: \"The emerging U.S. advanced battery industry represents a bold experiment by the federal government in direct financial support of private companies to establish a domestic manufacturing industry.\" \"The photovoltaic industry is an example of a U.S. high-tech sector that has lost global share but has a solid opportunity to re-emerge as a leader with the right mix of federal and state policy support. In the case of solar power, a deciding factor will be whether the United States will become a big enough market to support a large-scale, globally competitive manufacturing industry. Federal and state incentives will be essential for the next few years, until the cost of solar energy can compete against electricity generated from fossil fuels without subsidies. Another question is whether U.S. companies that focus on products incorporating promising new technologies will be able to survive surging imports of low-cost photovoltaic cells and modules based on mature technologies long enough to attain economies of scale. \" \"This turn of fortunes is primarily due to strategic moves and investments in new technologies by U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. Yet, their success also rests on the important contributions of U.S. policy that was driven by an engaged industry. There were two additional interrelated elements to the U.S. success:10 The research consortium SEMATECH, a $200 million-a-year research effort co-funded by the federal government and most large American chip companies, accelerated productivity and innovation in semiconductor manufacturing based on a common technology roadmap and enabled a rapid decline in prices.11 Persistent trade negotiations and enforcement of previous agreements won commitments from Japan to open its market to U.S. semiconductors and curtail dumping in any world market.12 This was deemed essential to prevent the United States from becoming a high-priced island in a sea of underpriced semiconductors. Had that occurred, it would have severely disadvantaged downstream American electronics equipment producers compared with competitors producing abroad utilizing lower-priced dumped chips.\" \"The decline and resurgence of the U.S. semiconductor industry offers many useful lessons for policymakers and industrialists grappling with how to bolster other American high-technology sectors facing intense international competitive pressure. It shows that erosion of U.S. leadership in manufacturing is not irreversible as long as both industry and government are committed to cooperative action, both on trade policy and in well-designed research programs that will lead to innovation\" What are some examples of this? Tax-credits is a big one. Think of Tesla, sales were boosted because there was an EV tax-credit. Further, there is actually no Tesla without the US department of Energy. \"In January 2010, the Department of Energy issued a $465 million loan to Tesla Motors to produce specially designed, all-electric plug-in vehicles\" [3] Without that loan, Tesla would have been toast. > China's mass urbanization, huge cheap labour base, a culture of hard work, and the West happily destroying their own industry...it's easy to 'pick' winners in a flush market. While that might all be true - when China was building its solar panel industry - the market was not flush. To your point, the Solyndra example and the subsequent divestment are good examples of the US destroying its solar industry. The lack of subsidies for solar panel meant demand and production remained anemic, meanwhile there were strong subsidies given directly to oil companies. The USG effectively cut-off the tap before demand picked up, why would then any US company produce very expensive solar panels with nobody really to buy them? Now that the price has come down, China just dominates, it was their innovation and supports that created the conditions for that to happen. > I also take issue with the idea China's success in manufacturing I am being specific to the solar industry. A broader generalization to all of manufacturing would need its own evidence. Yet, there are broad over time and across many governments, examples of industries that got their roots from government support. The solar example is very salient because it was so notable with Solyndra and then the US not strongly supporting renewables, and then lost out big on that industry.

It'll be interesting to see if more small battery PHEVs come out trying to target HEV price points with the tax credit. It would still be a huge jump up from standard hybrids which as far as I'm aware are rarely more than 1.5kWh. kWh makes sense if your goal is to stimulate US battery production but I really wish there were an all-electric range requirement, A hypothetical 6.8kWh Prius Prime would get more range that the 21kWh Wrangler 4xe. https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/credits-for-new-clean... reply jsight 15 hours agorootparentYeah, and the 7kwh should cost ~$1k.

    "title": "YouTube Developers Successfully Launch Plan to Retire Internet Explorer 6",
    "originLink": "https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6",
    "originBody": "May 1, 2019 A Conspiracy To Kill IE6 The bittersweet consequence of YouTube’s incredible growth is that so many stories will be lost underneath all of the layers of new paint. This is why I wanted to tell the story of how, ten years ago, a small team of web developers conspired to kill IE6 from inside YouTube and got away with it. I do not recall the exact triggering event that led to our web development team laying out plans to kill IE6 over lunch in the YouTube cafeteria. Perhaps it was the time I pushed out a CSS stylesheet that included an attribute selector on a semi-supported HTML element. Any reasonable web developer would expect this to be ignored by browsers not up to the task. This was not the case with older flavors of IE. Under very specific conditions, an attribute selector on an unsupported HTML element in IE would create an internal recursion that would at best, cause the browser to crash and at worst, trigger a blue screen of death. Or perhaps it was the hundredth time one of our software engineers had innocently pushed out antag with an empty src attribute. Nobody joining the team could be expected to know that in early versions of IE, the browser would load the root path “/” for empty src attributes. Thetag would suddenly behave like an , loading our homepage and all of its dependent resources in what could become an exponentially expanding recursive loop. Whenever an empty image tag found its way on to the homepage, it was all-hands-on-deck emergency to locate and replace the offending code before we melted our servers into paperweights. Regardless of whatever the event at that time was, it had been brutal and it had been IE6 related. IE6 had been the bane of our web development team’s existence. At least one to two weeks every major sprint cycle had to be dedicated to fixing new UI that was breaking in IE6. Despite this pain, we were told we had to continue supporting IE6 because our users might be unable to upgrade or might be working at companies that were locked in. IE6 users represented around 18% of our user base at that point. We understood that we could not just drop support for it. However, sitting in that cafeteria, having only slept about a few hours each in the previous days, our compassion for these users had completely eroded away. We began collectively fantasizing about how we could exact our revenge on IE6. One idea rose to the surface that quickly captured everyone’s attention. Instead of outright dropping IE6 support, what if we just threatened to? How would users react? Would they revolt against YouTube? Would they mail death threats to our team like had happened in the past? Or would they suddenly become loud advocates of modern browsers? We openly daydreamed about cubicle workers around the world suddenly inventing creative “business” reasons for needing upgraded browsers. Grandparents would hold their technically savvy grand-kids hostage, demanding they fix their “YouTubes”. What had begun as a team therapy session started to materialize into an actual plan, a plan we quickly realized we were uniquely positioned to execute on. The plan was very simple. We would put a small banner above the video player that would only show up for IE6 users. It would read “We will be phasing out support for your browser soon. Please upgrade to one of these more modern browsers.” Next to the text would be links to the current versions of the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, IE8 and eventually, Opera. The text was intentionally vague and the timeline left completely undefined. We hoped that it was threatening enough to motivate end users to upgrade without forcing us to commit to any actual deprecation plan. Users would have the ability to close out this warning if they wanted to ignore it or deal with it later. The code was designed to be as subtle as possible so that it would not catch the attention of anyone monitoring our checkins. Nobody except the web development team used IE6 with any real regularity, so we knew it was unlikely anyone would notice our banner appear in the staging environment. We even delayed having the text translated for international users so that a translator asking for additional context could not inadvertently surface what we were doing. Next, we just needed a way to slip the code into production without anyone catching on. The IE6 Deprecation Banner on YouTube in 2009 It turned out that a handful of us had entered YouTube at an interesting time… several months after YouTube had been acquired by Google but before Google had begun deeply integrating YouTube into their larger organization. The early YouTube engineers were rightfully territorial and initially hesitant to adapt to Google’s infrastructure and norms. With their penchants for gray-hat hacking, fast cars, and hard whiskey and an uncommon number of piercings, tattoos, and minor arrest records, many had been rejected during previous Google interviews. Ending up at YouTube instead, they found themselves breaking their backs to stay ahead of exponentially growing traffic while having to constantly defend against critics explaining how Google Video would imminently kill them. By the time they were acquired into Google, many of these engineers had come to view their outcast identity as a critical component of their eventual success. To cement their authority over the YouTube codebase during the integration into Google, the early engineers created a specialized permission set called “OldTuber”. OldTuber granted you the ability to completely bypass the new Google-oriented code enforcement policies, enabling anyone holding it to commit code directly to the YouTube codebase, with only the most glancing of code reviews from anyone. No need for code readability. No need for exhaustive tests. No need for maintaining code coverage. If you broke the site by improperly wielding OldTuber status, it was on your head and you would lose the privilege immediately, if not your job. So you just had to be a good citizen and never break the site. Our boss, an early YouTube engineer himself, had gone out of his way to ingratiate the web development team with the rest of the early YouTube engineers. Through his efforts, a couple of us eventually found ourselves in possession of OldTuber status, despite never having been a part of the original team. It was like we were just walking down the street when someone mistook us for valets and handed us the keys to their Ferrari. For better or for worse, we were not exactly the types to just hand the keys back and walk away. We saw an opportunity in front of us to permanently cripple IE6 that we might never get again. If this went at all wrong, a number of us would surely be fired. Our most renegade web developer, an otherwise soft-spoken Croatian guy, insisted on checking in the code under his name, as a badge of personal honor, and the rest of us leveraged our OldTuber status to approve the code review. The code merged into production and our banner went live a few days later. The first person to come by our desks was the PR team lead. He was a smart, dapper man who was always bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. Except this time. This time he was uncharacteristically prickly. He had come in on an otherwise normal day to find email from every major tech news publication asking why the second largest website on the planet was threatening to cut off access to nearly a fifth of its user base. Fortunately for us, the publications had already settled on a narrative that this was a major benefit to the Internet. By their call, YouTube was leading the charge towards making the web a faster, safer experience for all of its users. The entire PR team had Macs running Chrome and could not even see what we had done, let alone issue comments to the press on any of it. They were caught completely unaware. We eagerly told them everything about what we had launched and helped them craft the necessary talking points to expand on the narrative already established by the media. Satisfied that he could get back in front of the story, the PR team lead turned and warned us to never do anything like this without telling him first. He did not want to let great public relations opportunities like this slip by ever again. Next came the lawyers. Two senior lawyers sprinted over to our desks in a state of buttoned-down panic. They immediately demanded that we remove the banner. We explained how we would need the SREs to do an emergency push and that it would take at least a few hours to do. Frustrated, one of the lawyers asked “Why did you have to put Chrome first?” Confused, I explained that we did not give any priority to Chrome. Our boss, in on the conspiracy with us, had thoughtfully recommended that we randomize the order of the browsers listed and then cookie the random seed for each visitor so that the UI would not jump around between pages, which we had done. As luck would have it, these two lawyers still used IE6 to access certain legacy systems and had both ended up with random seeds that placed Chrome in the first position. Their fear was that by showing preferential treatment to Chrome, we might prick the ears of European regulators already on the lookout for any anti-competitive behavior. While the lawyers conceded that nothing we had done would have likely risen to that level of offense, it had happened on their watch and they did not appreciate that. I repeatedly cleared the cookies in my copy of IE6 and showed the browsers reshuffling with each refresh. Content with the demonstration, the lawyers quickly retreated back to their desks without any further concerns. I expected the next people to be the engineering managers and that they would be the angriest given how clearly we had abused our OldTuber status. Suspiciously, nobody came by that day. The next day, a handful of engineers stopped by to congratulate us on the launch of the banner after reading articles around the Internet, but that was it. I asked my boss if he was getting any blowback and he shrugged, indicating that nobody had pulled him aside yet. It seemed that for the moment we were in the clear. Surprised and unable to make sense of this, I probed one of the managers about what he thought about the banner launching. He responded “Oh, I just figured you guys copied the banner that Google Docs had put up.” I was confused. How could Google Docs have beaten us to the punch on this? I opened up Google Docs in IE6 and sure enough, a banner very much like ours was showing at the top. It implored their users to upgrade to avoid breaking features in terms similarly vague to ours. I had met a few engineers on the Google Docs team while working on some shared Javascript libraries. I reached out to one and asked how they had arrived at the decision to launch their own banner. He explained to me that they had been wanting to deprecate IE6 support for a long time but their managers would not let them for the same reasons we had always heard. One of their engineers testing in IE6 had noticed the YouTube banner pretty shortly after it went live and immediately took it to their manager as evidence as to why they should do the same. Shortly thereafter, the Google Docs engineers whipped up their own IE6 banner and pushed it into production, presumably under the mistaken assumption that we had done our diligence and had received all of the necessary approvals. The first time many Googlers heard chatter about IE6 banners was from email threads where other teams had begun asking if they could deprecate IE6 like Google Docs had. Luck would have it that this had included many of our managers. Amazingly, we had somehow bypassed detection as the originators of the IE6 banner inside of Google. Eventually the YouTube engineering management did ask themselves how the decision to deprecate IE6 was ultimately made, given it happened so quickly and seemed conspicuously premature for a media site of our scale and with such a wide user base. Once they realized what had happened, they cornered our boss for details, grappled with the consequences of our actions and begrudgingly arrived at the conclusion that the ends had justified the means. Between YouTube, Google Docs, and several other Google properties posting IE6 banners, Google had given permission to every other site on the web to add their own. IE6 banners suddenly started appearing everywhere. Within one month, our YouTube IE6 user base was cut in half and over 10% of global IE6 traffic had dropped off while all other browsers increased in corresponding amounts. The results were better than our web development team had ever intended. The Historical Share of Different IE Browser Versions (https://www.w3counter.com/trends) We somehow got away with our plan to kill IE6 without facing any meaningful corrective action. Few people even knew we were involved at all and those that did, did not want to bring attention to it or risk encouraging similar behavior. At a beer garden in San Francisco, our boss, winking his hardest, made us swear to never do anything like this again. We agreed, toasted IE6 falling into single digit percentages, and never snuck anything into production again. 11,524 Kudos 11,524 Kudos",

IE was such a cancer on the internet, everyone in the bad old days programmed to the lowest common denominator (IE6, 7, or 8). Even while brand new features and standards were widely adopted by everyone else. One of the worst things that's happened is nearly everyone converging on using webkit to render everything. Feels like slowly stepping backwards into the days when everyone writes for webkit rather than a more open internet. That being said, there's so little difference between webkit and gecko now-a-days that it's really hardly a major issue. reply ksherlock 11 hours agoparentThe thing about IE, one thing anyway, is that it's CSS support, box model, etc, was broken and non standard. So you would need to exploit CSS parser bugs to give IE a separate CSS, use DXImageTransformFilter to make png transparency work, etc. Maybe by WebKit you mean Blink and by Blink you mean V8, because when somebody does a \"something that doesn't work in Safari or FireFox\" it's usually a javascript problem not a CSS or rendering problem. And every 6 months someone complains that Safari is literally worse than IE 5 because it doesn't support some non-standard privacy nightmare API that Google added last week. reply ttfkam 11 hours agorootparentI came to hate IE with every fiber of my being, but let's call a spade a spade here: IE basically invented modern CSS. Netscape 3/4 and IE 3/4 had very different views on how web pages should be dynamic and how they should be styled. IE championed CSS and the DOM. Netscape was fixated on bgcolor, font tags, etc. Netscape introduced thetag. IE just made every tag a potential layer. Remember AJAX? Loading content from a script and injecting it into a page? That was 100% IE. The issue wasn't that IE 5, 5.5, and 6 were bad when they came out. They weren't. Not one bit. They were absolutely the cutting edge. Then Netscape died, Microsoft had no more competition in the field, and so they basically just stopped. For years. Mozilla (and shortly after, Firefox) prompted an eventual response, which was IE7: I minor update to an otherwise abandoned codebase. Once it was clear folks were seriously looking at dumping IE, IE8 followed shortly after. The CSS Acid Test showed how far IE had fallen behind, so IE9 and IE10 moved to stop the bleeding. IE 11 was the final release before Microsoft finally dropped the legacy IE baggage, aka the Trident engine. By that time Chrome had stormed the field, and Edge's renderer just couldn't keep up relative to the amount of money Microsoft was willing to pay. So they dumped their own engine and moved to Blink. (If you can't beat em…) But let's be clear, between 1998 and 2003, IE was at the forefront. Its CSS support wasn't broken. It was the best and only. Its box model wasn't broken. There were no other box models to compare it to. You didn't need to give it separate CSS, because it was the only one around really to parse it. It didn't have non-standard AJAX support. It WAS the standard since no XMLHttpRequest object existed at the time. You could write VBScript on a web page instead of JavaScript and have a >90% chance that client could run it. Flash didn't have to be bundled or installed separately, ActiveX just took care of it in the middle of your browsing session. It was the Bronze Age of the web. IE was the one that moved us beyond stone tools. Later supplanted by Firefox and Safari's Iron Age, but still an important and arguably necessary step toward the modern web we know today, including the box model. reply cogman10 10 hours agorootparentWhat was bad about IE, more than anything else, was how tightly integrated to the OS it was. Running windows 2000? You can only run IE6. Running windows XP? IE8 is your limit. This was particularly problematic because MS struggled MIGHTILY to get Vista out the door. It was a decade of really terrible IE which was pushed out longer due to Vista's poor performance and stability. Meanwhile, you could install firefox and later chrome and get a relatively modern internet browsing experience. Ironically, I think the thing that hurt firefox adoption was the switch to the evergreen model. The era of firefox 3->~33 was quiet painful, updating was simply far too intrusive. \"You are out of date, click here to download the latest version!\". Chrome from the get go was pretty good at making that seamless. reply jwells89 9 hours agorootparentMy memory may be failing me but I think Firefox 3 was also where it started to feel less like the snappy minimal utilitarian “just a browser” it was in versions prior and started to feel more clunky, branded, and product-y, which also didn’t help its adoption in my opinion. If nothing else it primed users for adopting Chrome, which originally had a less branded, more utilitarian feel not unlike early Firefox. This cycle is somewhat repeating itself though as Chrome has become very branded and product-y. Would love to see something similarly functionally-minded as early FF/Chrome come out and take a big bite out of Chrome’s marketshare. reply gregmac 5 hours agorootparentprevI think the update experience was a small part of it, but for me the process model of Chrome was the main thing that made me eventually switch. Crappy javascript on one tab would lock up the entire browser -- a thing that just simply doesn't happen in Chrome. reply vintagedave 1 hour agorootparentprev> IE championed CSS and the DOM. Netscape was fixated on bgcolor, font tags, etc. Netscape championed its own alternate to CSS: JSSS. Javascript-based Style Sheets.[1] But the W3C went for CSS, so the CSS implementation in Netscape 4 (1997) was very rushed, and poor quality.

Speaking of bronze age, people forget how slow js was then. I remember writing server code that generated js code of pre-populated arrays to push down to the client to use for interactivity. Sending json and populating on the client was slow enough I could count in my head while watching the screen. Array look ups though were fast enough. reply antod 6 hours agorootparentprevYou're completely correct that IE 4.0 - 6.0 was kicking Netscape's butt in terms of CSS support (not difficult as Netscape 4.x was truly awful). But not quite right that it was the best or only until 2003. Opera could probably claim best CSS in the late 90s. And by 2003, Netscape 6.0 & 7.0 and Mozilla Suite 1.0 would have better CSS 2 support than IE 6. reply michaelt 10 hours agorootparentprev> But let's be clear, between 1998 and 2003, IE was at the forefront.

That doesn't match my memory at all, unless you include Phoenix under the Firefox umbrella. I switched … I don't remember exactly when, probably in late 2003, but certainly when it was called Phoenix, and it was such a breath of fresh air coming from IE. I'm sure there were breakages, because it was the early noughties and that's what the internet was like, but I don't remember a single time wishing for something that IE provided that Phoenix didn't. But I was just coming to it as a user, not as a dev—maybe you're referring to the dev perspective. reply jen20 9 hours agorootparentprevAs I recall, IE5 on the Mac actually had very few of these problems and was highly standards compliant. reply ttfkam 8 hours agorootparentAnd maybe peaked at 3% marketshare between 2000 and 2003 during Apple's early resurgence. Remember that Apple almost died in the late 90s. It wasn't the juggernaut it is today by a long shot. Mac IE became its own albatross for web development for a while once Safari hit its stride and supplanted it. Prior to somewhere between 2003 and 2005, \"web standards\" were aspirational rather than the reality on the ground. There was Internet Explorer for Windows at 85-90% and all the bit players scrambling for a percentage point or two. For the bit players, the standards were their only bid for survival since no one would tolerate putting extra dev time into an extra 1%. Together, you could make a case for a 10-15% target.

Box model in particular was because they used the much saner border-box instead of the official spec's content-box, which was what everyone else used. You could make the other browsers act like IE by specifying it with box-sizing in the CSS, or from IE8 onwards you could make IE act like the others. reply yjftsjthsd-h 12 hours agoparentprev> One of the worst things that's happened is nearly everyone converging on using webkit to render everything.

Sure it wasn't the best but no one forced people to use it. No one was forced to use IE, but many people had the decision made for them. Sometimes it was because it shipped as the default on the dominant operating system. (I suspect people forget how dominant Windows was. While Windows remains the dominant operating system on desktop computers to this day, their share wasn't diluted by platforms like Android and iOS.) Other times it was because sites designed exclusively for IE were visibly broken in other browsers. (I suspect part of the reason why I am not bothered by incompatibilities with Firefox to this day is because the incompatibilities are minor compared to those we faced in the past.) I do agree with your sentiment about conspiracy boasting, though from a different perspective. Their actions represent a group of people in a position of power making a decision for other people, even if it wasn't an officially sanctioned decision.

Set your target to any CSS that has been around for about a year or so and is based on standards and you shouldn't need to be writing anything different for specific browsers. I haven't had to target a specific browser for any CSS in years. I honestly don't know what people are trying to do that would require this now days. Grids, flexbox, animations, transitions no issues and don't even need browser prefixes. The only thing that I can think of that still requires a browser prefix in safari is -webkit-backdrop-filter.

I've started webdev in 2003 and was doing PSD to HTML/CSS conversions in the evenings and nights after my webdev dayjob.

In time I've learned enough tricks to know all the workarounds and could look at a given PSD file and know within 30min precision how many hours it'll take me, at that point I've started charging clients on top for IE6 support, this was around 2008.

Only after they bought github and linkedin I gave in. reply macNchz 10 hours agoparentI was still messing around with IE6 as late as 2012...the web agency I worked at had clients in huge old school companies who must have had proprietary internal software that depended on it. Whenever we thought we could finally ditch it, we'd get forwarded an email from a higher up at a client company with a subject like \"??????\" containing a screenshot of our pre-launch environment for a new site looking entirely broken in IE6. At that point we had this giant wad (like, several files and multiple megabytes?) of JS and CSS of uncertain provenance that we'd conditionally load for IE6 that magically made almost all of the more modern stuff actually just work. I'll never forget the feeling of rage-then-relief when the screenshot situation above happened a matter of hours before a major site launch. I booted my IE6 VM, shrieked at how utterly broken the site was, copied over that ungodly blob of polyfills and dark magic, reloaded the page and everything looked correct.

Since Firefox and Chrome were self-updating, they didn't have the problem of obsolete versions floating around. reply pompino 6 hours agorootparentMicrosoft was already offering users to upgrade to IE8. Users chose IE6 for whatever reason. Most likely because non-technical users didn't give a shit, or maybe they were stuck on IE6 due to ActiveX or other compatibility issues. Google faked a \"we will be phasing out support\" screen to trick users into changing the browser. All this talk of open source and \"open\" this and \"open\" that, and yet they still want to manipulate the user. How about you let the users choose? And if they choose wrong so be it. I guess it is understandable given they are in the advertising business. Maybe Google has others' fooled, but they haven't fooled everyone yet. reply zx8080 11 hours agoprevNot saying IE6 is good.
